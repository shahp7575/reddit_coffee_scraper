It‚Äôs at a local coffee shop and will not be too huge. The venue is encouraging Valentine‚Äôs Day themed pieces that can be purchased. I have card designs that I would like to make prints of to sell but to be honest I‚Äôm not sure what is the best way to tackle this. These designs are digital so I do not need to do any scanning work to my knowledge. Any advice or instruction on how to go about this would be greatly appreciated. ,2,1736815299.0,artbusiness,1,1.0,False

This has been a point of contention for me since he moved in. He‚Äôs not just been uninterested in flarp, he‚Äôs flat out flarp phobic! Ever since he moved in he‚Äôs been giving me weird looks, refusing to flarp with me, and criticizing me for spending money on flarp instead of ‚Äúnecessities‚Äù like toothpaste or shampoo. 

Today I had enough. I had to get him into flarping. For his own good. This may sound a little immoral but i slipped sedatives into his coffee this morning. He was out cold. I then filled the bathtub with a little project I‚Äôve been working on: big flarp! It‚Äôs just a lot of flarp mixed together. It lined the entire tub. Anyways, I covered him in olive oil and gently placed him in the tub. It took a while but he finally woke up and is now gleefully sliding around the tub, flarping away! He can‚Äôt get out because i covered him in olive oil but is having a flarptastic time.

1i0tcaz,https://www.reddit.com/r/neilgaiman/comments/1i0tcaz/unsure_where_to_stand/,Unsure where to stand.,"Okay please bare with me as I try to get this out 

First point of call, anything I say here is at no point a justification for what has happened and the damage it has caused those directly involved as well as all of us indirectly involved.

Neil's work helped me get through so many rough points in my life. His characters brought joy into places where there was none.

From Duran Durans biography, Sandman, The Tragical Comedy or Comical Tragedy of Mr Punch to Ocean at the end of the lane and Norse God's.

Figures in his book have been written as if they could step of the pages into our world.

I could pick up any book, comic or article and feel calm.

Then he started seeing my all time favorite artiest Amanda Palmer. They even had an amazing young man together.  Traveled to my country and all I could think of was this was amazing I could see them both. Sit with them have coffee ask 1000 of questions.

Then the first rumors started,  I didn't want to believe that some one i idoliest so much could treat any one that way.

More and more came out. Amanda left him and took Ash, which sealed that for me. But still how could some one that much of my life raised me with his characters and fantasy worlds.

Yes looking back at the writing there are signs.

Same as alot of authors.
Orson Scott card, Marion Zimmer Bradley, Junot Diaz, Philip K Dick to name a few, 

But how do you deal with some one that has betrayed everything you thought was right. There are some lines you do not cross no matter what. SA is one of them.

I will not ever get rid of my collection of books, CDs, pop figures, comics etc I have a signed copy of An Evening with Neil and Amanda. 

I will never support actions that put others in unwanted harm or abuse.
Again as I stated this is no way a justification of what has happened and how those people were treated. 

I want to go back to before I knew about all of this and never find out.

2. Where do you usually get your coffee? Do you pick it up at a shop, farmers market, or have it shipped?
3. Are there any local subscriptions/delivery service for coffee from these roasters?

I'm meeting my date for a coffee on the weekend. It's very cold in my city so I want to layer up a bit. I was thinking about wearing a beige sherpa trucker jacket with a white T-shirt and dark wash jeans (like the image below). Is this outfit good for the first date. I was also considering wearing a light blue oxford shirt with a cardigan but I don't want to overdo it since this is a coffee date. Any suggestions are welcome. Thanks

1i0t7ni,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHealth/comments/1i0t7ni/what_kind_of_doctor_should_i_see/,What kind of doctor should I see?,"Hi everyone,

I could really use Reddit's help to determine which type of doctor to see. I've put some general info below. I've tried scheduling with a general PCP and Orthopedist, but after speaking with each office on the phone, they told me they aren't the correct doctors.

Symptoms: 

General muscle soreness everywhere since I was little - particularly my hamstrings, butt, and hips. Secondarily, My back, calves, ankles, feet, arms, and neck. Chest, stomach, groin area almost never sore.

Migraines occur for the rest of the day after any intense physical exertion, particularly my ice hockey games. Started monitoring my sleep, diet, and prior exercise - found that I don't get a migraine after hockey when I get enough sleep, eat well, and take a vitamin/Liquid IV immediately before.

Additional Health Info:

‚Ä¢ 29 yrs old, 175 lbs, 5'7"" ‚Ä¢ Celiac disease - diagnosed in 2004 (8 yrs. old at the time) 
‚Ä¢ muscle soreness has been prevalent all my life, but started getting debilitating midway through college. Not sure if this is due to puberty, aging, or sitting too much. 
‚Ä¢ is now to the point where my wife needs to massage me almost everyday after work, or I'll need to take two Advil to get through the rest of the night.
‚Ä¢ Don't abuse any drugs or alcohol (have never been drunk or high), and eat whole organic foods almost all week. In the rare event we eat out, I'll get a chicken or steak bowl from Chipotle. Ingest highly processed foods and refined sugar probably once or twice a week (dessert at my parents for example). Consistently well hydrated - drink at least 7 to 8 water bottles a day (roughly 120 ounces a day) 
‚Ä¢ Do not drink any coffee or caffeine at all 
‚Ä¢ stretch every night before bed to stave off soreness in order to fall asleep 
‚Ä¢ soreness has been reduced since I started taking a new multivitamin - Envitamin Ultimate Multivitamin. Now when I don't take it, I'm extremely sore all over 
‚Ä¢ absent-mindedly massage my arms and legs almost all throughout the day

Plans:

‚Ä¢ Find the right doctor ‚Ä¢ would like to take blood work and see if I have a serious nutrient deficiency. I could have had this my whole life, and the symptoms have gotten worse since puberty. 
‚Ä¢ measure certain muscle lengths in the body with the most soreness. Maybe my hamstrings, for example, are too short, causing a chain reaction of posture issues and overall muscle soreness? 
‚Ä¢ Take an increased dose of each vitamin from my multivitamin (not all at once). Take each dose every day for a month to see which vitamin in particular I'm responding to positively in the multivitamin.

Any input would help a ton. This has gone on long enough. Thanks again everyone

My husband has what appears to be a mild stomach bug, no fever no vomiting not even using the bathroom more than usual, but he‚Äôs saying he‚Äôs so sick he can‚Äôt even get up off the couch. I don‚Äôt want to gaslight him or say I don‚Äôt believe him so I‚Äôve been taking care of him since yesterday.. in addition to my 4 month old and 2.5 year old. I already bought ingredients for stuff so I had to cook (minimally, grilled cheese, rice, meat), order a bunch of medicine for him, bath time, all naps for both kids, and constantly ask if he‚Äôs hungry or thirsty. He would just not eat or drink at all if I didn‚Äôt hand him things. He refused to drink any coffee and his usual is 4 cups/day so obviously he feels exhausted and now also has a withdrawal headache. 

If he‚Äôs this sick, shouldn‚Äôt he go to the doctor? The hospital? Wtf. 

I didn‚Äôt say any of this to him of course bc maybe he really is that sick. But it‚Äôs finally 730pm and I‚Äôm finally able to just lay down. I‚Äôm sooo so done. It was one of those days where I had no personality or purpose other than serving everyone all day. I literally didn‚Äôt have 1 minute alone in 13 hours. And I know if I get whatever this virus is, I‚Äôll be home alone with my 2 kids and will somehow manage to get off the couch. I just have little sympathy after 2 pregnancies and 2 births in 3 years. Plus decades of period pain. All of which I and most women just work through. I feel taken advantage of today bc he didn‚Äôt even seem to notice or say thank you for any of it.

1i0t634,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1i0t634/1st_machine_should_i_get_the_bbe_or_a_dedica/,1st machine! Should I get the BBE or a Dedica EC885/Varia VS3 combo? ($500),"Hello everyone! I‚Äôve always loved coffee and just realized how much I‚Äôve been spending on cafes for years. Very much looking to getting into the hobby of espresso making! My parents and I like different drinks. Some of them are Cappuccinos, Macchiatos, Flat Whites, Affogatos, Americanos, Cold Brews, and etc. 

Currently the Dedica EC885 Arte is on sale for around $160 where I‚Äôm at (in the Middle East). And i found the Varia VS3 to be priced around $320. Would that be a good deal/combo for less than $500? Or should I spend more and get the Breville Barista Express? That one‚Äôs at $570 on Amazon.  

P.S heard of the Gaggia Classic Pro and the Bambino Plus as well, but adding a grinder to it makes it out of budget already. As they‚Äôre both around the $570 mark each.",1,1736814249.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

She dropped her coffee today and smeared it wiping it up. The kitchenwas a mess. She cant Swiffer like she use too, throwing a wash cloth on the Swiffer and then fabuloso on the floor. Is a Swiffer wetjet easy to use and not heavy? 

Valentine's Day is coming up so I can't get it for her then. ",1,1736814238.0,AgingParents,1,0.67,False
1i0t4bm,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i0t4bm,Kilimanjaro Expedition 2024,"After successfully reaching the summit of Kilimanjaro, I felt an overwhelming sense of accomplishment as I descended back to Barafu Camp. 

I took a moment to appreciate the breathtaking panorama of the mountains surrounding me. I enjoyed a hearty bowl of soup and a hot mug of coffee, savouring every bite after the demanding climb.

I went on a third date. I thought things had been going great, but my date left abruptly, was non-committal about meeting again, and hasn‚Äôt reached out since. The obvious answer is that she lost interest. However, it was very, very sudden, so I wanted to see if anyone had a similar experience.

Long story short, we spent most of the day together - museum, coffee, drinks, and then dinner. After dinner, I asked if she wanted to go back to my place. She said yes, and we got in an Uber. As the car pulled up to my apartment, she said she was actually going to call an Uber home. She had brought up going out again during the date, so while we waited for her ride, I asked when she was free, and she gave me a date that was just over a week away. Finally, she left and texted me when she got home. I said goodnight, but she didn‚Äôt respond. I have not heard from her since (2 days ago now).

I understand changing her mind about going back to my place. Earlier in the night, we had talked about  not rushing things and not sleeping together too soon ‚Äì I can see how changing her mind would be consistent with all of that. However, setting a date over a week out after spending 8+ hours together and not texting since makes me think that she lost interest and was letting me down gently. I don‚Äôt know, maybe I‚Äôm just frustrated and venting. It seemed like she really liked me, so someone suddenly going cold like that really messes with your sense of what‚Äôs real. 

Should I text her? Plan a date for the day she gave me? Forget about the date and just move on? 

Sincerely, confused.

¬†

TL;DR: Went on a third date. Thought we had great chemistry. Date left abruptly and seemed disinterested about meeting again soon and have not heard back . Not sure whether I should forget about it and leave the ball in her court or reach out.",1,1736813966.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

I (33F) have been dating my boyfriend (35M) for six months. We have been friends since we were in high school together but not close as we were in different friendship circles in our own year groups. When I was 20 we had a one night stand where he removed the condom without telling me, and this led to me becoming pregnant. I did not tell him at the time as I was very angry and wanted to think through my decision before talking to him, but before I did I had a miscarriage at 11 weeks. This led to me finding out I will never be able to have a baby. After this I distanced myself from him and his friends for 13 years.

8 months ago we were at a mutual friend's party and reconnected. We went for coffee afterwards where we both said we were interested in dating each other casually. I said my condition for this was he never removes the condom again without asking me as I was very angry about this and had carried that anger all these years. He apologised a lot, said he was ashamed he ever did that, and promised to never do it again- and from what he can recall he never did this to anyone else. Since then it has been great between us and we both want to be more serious and have started talking about the future. I think I need to tell him before we commit but I am not sure, and I have no clue how to tell him. 

I found the miscarriage very hard and it had a lot of consequences for me, such as I lost the one friend I told as the pressure of her keeping that secret impacted on our relationship, and I lost the deposit for the flat I was living in at the time because of how much blood I lost during the miscarriage that went all over my mattress and carpet that I could never fully scrub out. I don't know how much I should tell him, if I try to be neutral or let him see how angry and hurt I was. I know there will be people who think I should not date him but he has grown into someone I like and he makes me happy. I have tried therapy but the therapist struggled to understand how I felt which has put me off going to any therapy regarding this- at least anyone who is in my price range. 

TLDR: I had a one night stand at 20 with someone who stealthed me, I became pregnant and miscarried, 13 years later I am dating the person who did this and want to know how to talk to him about what happened.

The next day he woke up and was trying to hook up (I wasn't in the mood at that moment), and then he went out to get us coffees.

I'll tell you why I started and how I do it. I'll also share ideas for how you can do it like me or different ways.

My why? An extra income stream..my main industry I worked in was changing and just saw it declining.

It went to zero within 6 months of starting this.

Within my first week I made 4 figures with digital products. Everyone has their own unique experience, this was mine.

What I do? I sell ebooks and courses. Some I created myself using tools like Google Docs and Canva. Courses hosted on Gumroad, Teachable and Skool.

Also resell done-for-you digital products.

I'm in the entrepreneurship niche but you can tackle this in any niche: beauty, gardening, basketball, food, coffee, etc.

My goal? I want to make this my sole business in the future. Hope to get there in the next year.

 I will be scaling and adding AI automation I think..I may also add a VA at some point, when I need more help.

My marketing is all organic so adding paid ads in the future may be something I do.

How I sell? I have an online store and sell in the Gumroad marketplace. 

You could also do this on Etsy, Creative Market, Whop and other places.

My marketing? Social media mostly but also email marketing. 

I think this is pretty beginner friendly..I recently helped a beginner start a digital products business and she brought in over 1200 in sales in her country's currency (AUD) in the first 7 days.

Who else does digital products?

Do you do it full time? And any words of advice for me.

AITA?

I was best friends with someone, let‚Äôs call him Guy, for about 10 years. We met in school and he was bullied a little for being gay, he was also younger than me, but we somehow found out we had the same music taste and a close friendship formed.

We were inseparable for years, we talked everyday and saw each other often. It wasn‚Äôt until mid 2020 that he had cut me off completely after a few months of being really distant. I tried so hard, asking if anything was bothering him, had I said anything to upset him, but he just said that things change. I understand the pandemic was detrimental to some people, but he gave me absolutely nothing to go off.

I then spent 4 years wondering what I had done wrong as he cut me off, deleted all social media so there was no trace of him. 

Then in April 2024 he text me out of the blue saying he really valued our friendship in the past and we arranged a coffee date. The coffee date was lovely - we sat and spoke for 4 hours and it was like no time had passed. He addressed ghosting me and apologised and I again asked him what had happened. He said he wasn‚Äôt sure and changed the subject. I was let down that after all this time, still no explanation.

We left the coffee date agreeing to meet again but we never did, we haven‚Äôt even spoken since. I have got so used to not having him in my life that I kept forgetting to get in touch. AITA?

My husband, Daniel Hart, had been transsffferring 30,000 to the same woman every month without fail. The first payment was dated back two years, right around the time we lost our first child.

Then, as if on cue, my phone chimed with a messenger notification. from her.

It was a friend request, along with a note that read:-

‚ÄúThe happy woman who gets $30,000 in pocket money every month.‚Äô I felt an eerie calm wash over me, almost unnatural. As I stroked my belly, I clicked ‚Äòaccept.‚Äô

Immediately, a message popped up:

‚ÄòDid you get the bank statement?‚Äò

Ignoring it, I went straight to her account profile. The earliest post was from two years ago, on April 21. In the photo, she leaned gently on a man‚Äôs shoulder, her hand resting on him, showcasing a massive diamond ring.

The caption read:

‚ÄúThank you for the birthday gift, love!‚Äù

Although only the man‚Äôs back was visible, I recognized him instantly. It was Daniel. My husband. He was wearing the shirt Lhad bought him. during a business trip, the one with intricate embroidery on the collar.

Two years ago, April 21, was the day lost our first child. While I lay in the cold, sterile operating room, undergoing a D&C procedure, my ‚Äòon‚Äìa‚Äìbusiness‚Äìtrip‚Äò husband was celebrating another woman‚Äôs birthday.

The irony was almost suffocating.

My hands trembled as I scrolled further through her posts. Since that day, she had been flaunting all kinds of luxury items, each one identical to things I owned, except for one.

A jasmine‚Äìscented perfume.

Then I saw her most recent post, pinned at the top. It was an ultrasound image. She was pregnant.

I dropped my phone, my heart pounding, and frantically searched through the dirty laundry basket. I found the shirt Daniel had worn the night before. Lifting it to my nose, the unmistakable scent of jasmine hit me.

I never wear perfume.

When I didn‚Äôt respond to the message, the person on the other end. grew impatient. My phone buzzed again and again as photos and videos came flooding in. Clutching my belly, I sank onto the couch, struggling to breathe.

I forced myself to look at the undeniable evidence of Daniel‚Äôs betrayal. The woman in the photos was young and beautiful, her ponytail. bouncing with life. There were pictures of her and Daniel.

He was rowing on a lake, playing in the snow, and tucking a maple leaf into her hair. It was as though each season, spring, summer, fall, and winter, was captured in their little love story.

Taking a deep breath, I shakily opened one of the videos. In it, Daniel stood by the ocean, tenderly calling her ‚ÄòMy Carina.‚Äò

She softly asked, ‚ÄúDo you love me?‚Äù

This was my husband of seven years, the father of the baby growing inside me, replying with a warmth I hadn‚Äôt seen in years.

‚ÄòI‚Äôll always love you, Cara.‚Äô

I replayed the video over and over, tears streaming down my face. As dusk fell, the room around me grew dim.

Daniel finally came home. His voice was gentle as he lightly scolded me, ‚ÄúOlivia, why didn‚Äôt you turn on the lights? It‚Äôs so dark! What if you fall?‚Äù

He flipped the light switch, and the room lit up. I quickly covered my tear‚Äìstreaked face as he knelt in front of me and took my hand.

‚ÄúWhy are you crying? Who made my precious wife and our little one so sad?‚Äù he asked, his voice soft as he kissed my belly.

As he leaned closer, I smelled the same sweet jasmine fragrance. Struggling to keep calm, I asked, ‚ÄúWhere were you?‚Äù

‚ÄúI was working late at the office. What‚Äôs wrong, honey?‚Äù Daniel replied casually, as though nothing was out of the ordinary..

‚ÄòYou‚Äôre lying, Daniel. You were with Cara! She had a craving for those famous dumplings from the east side of the city, and since there was no delivery, you drove over an hour from the west side to get them for her. She even live‚Äìstreamed the whole thing!‚Äò

Feigning nonchalance, I smiled, gently squeezing his hand. ‚ÄúHoney, I suddenly have a craving for those dumplings from the east side, too,‚Äù I said, resting my hands on my belly.

As if sensing my pain, the baby kicked hard. ‚ÄúCan you get some for me?‚Äù

Annoyance flickered across Daniel‚Äôs face as he pulled his hand away, frustration creeping into his expression. ‚ÄúThose dumplings aren‚Äôt anything special. Besides, you‚Äôre pretty far along. You should watch what you eat.‚Äù Standing up, he added, ‚ÄúFor the sake of our son, just bear with it a little longer, okay?‚Äù

Without waiting for a response, he muttered, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to take a shower. I‚Äôm exhausted. Why don‚Äôt you call Mom and ask her to make you something?‚Äù

The bathroom door clicked shut.

Swallowing my sobs, I gently stroked my belly and whispered, ‚ÄúOh, sweetheart, you and I are about to fight a tough battle together.‚Äù

Chapter 2

Daniel‚Äôs phone blinked on the dining table. As usual, he never even tried to hide his infidelity in front of me.

Did he really think I was that na√Øve?

The sound of water running in the bathroom echoed through the house. With a sigh, I struggled with my pregnant belly and slowly stood up. Hoping for a quick solution, I tried all the obvious. passwords from our wedding anniversary and our birthdays, but none of them worked. My hands trembled as I entered the date from Cara‚Äôs ultrasound report.

Success!

Biting my lip in frustration, I sneered as I opened the messaging app‚Äôs storage. Sure enough, Cara‚Äôs profile picture was there. Their avatars matched.

He said, ‚ÄúIf love lasts forever,‚Äù and she replied, ‚ÄúDoes it matter if we‚Äôre together every day?‚Äù

I clicked into the chat and was greeted by a flood of ‚ÄúDarling, I miss you‚Äù and ‚ÄúBaby, when will I see you again?‚Äù Determined not to let my emotions take over, I activated the screen recording feature.

Next, I opened Daniel‚Äôs shopping app. To my dismay, his order history was filled with pregnancy supplements, skincare products, and makeup. They were all sent to the same address. Every delivery was made to Cara.

With one hand resting on my restless baby, I took screenshots with the other. I sent the videos and screenshots to myself, then carefully deleted the evidence. Satisfied that everything was in order, I placed the phone back exactly where I‚Äôd found it.

Waddling back to the bedroom, I lay down on my side. The weight of betrayal settled over me as my heart felt like it had a hole ripped. through it, and I couldn‚Äôt stop shivering from the cold weight of betrayal. After seven years of marriage, I had been reduced to a cruel joke.

When Daniel came out of the shower, his phone rang. From my vantage point, through the crack in the door, I saw his face soften as he answered the call. Glancing toward the bedroom, he carefully stepped out onto the balcony, closing the door behind him.

Curiosity gnawing at me, I forced myself up and stood by the door, watching him. I couldn‚Äôt make out the words, but his expression was tender, with a slight smile. At some point, whoever was on the other end must have said something that made him frown in discomfort. But soon enough, he caved, agreeing with a subtle smile.

The chill in my chest deepened. Slowly, I turned and dragged myself back to bed, feeling as if the air had been sucked out of the room. Even breathing felt like a burden.

A few minutes later, I heard Daniel tiptoe back inside. One of his. hands rested on my belly while the other gently brushed the hair from my forehead.

His voice was soft as he whispered, ‚ÄúBaby, there‚Äôs an urgent project at work. I need to go in.‚Äù

I turned my head and stared deeply into his eyes. My last shred of hope flickered weakly as I asked, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt feel well. Could you stay?‚Äù

For a brief moment, I thought that if he chose to stay with me instead of running to her, I could try to forgive him.

But then I remembered: Once the kite string snaps, it can never be fixed.

As expected, Daniel gave me a troubled smile, trying to reassure me. ‚ÄúSweetheart, this project is essential for the company. Lean‚Äôt miss it.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôll call Mom to come over and stay with you, okay?‚Äù

A wave of nausea washed over me, goosebumps prickling my skin. Still, I managed to force out the words, ‚ÄúDrive safely.‚Äù

I lay there in silence, watching him get dressed and leave. Slowly, I got up, holding my belly, and made my way downstairs to hail a taxi. ‚ÄúMaplewood Estates,‚Äù I told the driver.

He sped through the streets, and just as we arrived, I saw Daniel‚Äôs car pull in. My stomach clenched as I asked the driver to park behind a tree. From the back seat, I watched as Cara fluttered into Daniel‚Äôs arms like a butterfly.

He caught her gently, placing a hand on her flat stomach. His face softened with a look of tender reproach, and he playfully tapped her nose.

Cradling my belly with one hand, I took out my phone and switched to video mode. With trembling fingers, I watched through the screen as Daniel lifted Cara into the passenger seat and carefully buckled her seatbelt.

My eyes burned, but I blinked back the tears.

‚ÄúDriver, follow that car,‚Äù I said.

The car climbed onto the overpass, neon lights flashing by outside the window. In a daze, my nails dug into the window frame until they split, the sharp pain snapping me back to reality. I put my bleeding fingers into my mouth and bit down hard.

As the car wove through the city streets, I repeated to myself repeatedly, ‚ÄúOlivia, endure it. The pain will pass.‚Äù

When we arrived at Riverside General Hospital, I scanned the QR code to pay the driver.

As I stepped out of the car, the usually quiet driver turned to me and said, with unexpected kindness, ‚ÄúMiss, take care of yourself. For the baby‚Äôs sake, don‚Äôt hurt yourself.‚Äù

Since discovering Daniel‚Äôs affair, I hadn‚Äôt told a soul. The secret felt like poison, slowly eating away at me from the inside. The kindness of a stranger felt like a fresh breath of air, pulling me back from the abyss.

I gently closed the car door, offering him a small smile. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, Sir. No‚Äìone can hurt me anymore. Because I‚Äôm ready to throw the trash where it belongs.‚Äù

Chapter 3

I hid behind a pillar, watching Daniel. He had been too busy with work to attend a single prenatal check‚Äìup with me during my entire pregnancy. Yet here he was, running around the hospital, registering, picking up medication, and gently helping another woman in and out like the perfect husband.

At that moment, I realized it wasn‚Äôt that he was too busy. He didn‚Äôt want to make an effort for the wife he‚Äôd been married to for seven years.

In the bustling hospital lobby, Daniel held the woman close, reminding her, ‚ÄúThe doctor said you should eat less tonight and try to stay active. In the early stages of pregnancy, digestion can be tricky, so let‚Äôs follow the advice this time, okay?‚Äù

‚ÄúAww, fine, I got it!‚Äù she replied, pouting playfully. But it‚Äôs your fault! You bought way too many dumplings.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlright, alright, I‚Äôll take the blame,‚Äù he said with a smile. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my fault. for making my sweetheart eat too much, okay?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs better.‚Äù She smirked. ‚ÄúFine, I‚Äôll forgive you‚Ä¶ this time.‚Äù

As I watched them, they bantered like a real couple, close and inseparable, while I stood under the hospital‚Äôs harsh fluorescent lights, feeling like an intruder in my own life. I was invisible to them. With a heavy heart, I held my belly and slowly shuffled out of the hospital. Outside, the scene was no less cruel. The rain had started. The cold autumn wind blew against me, and the rain felt like it was trying to drown the world in its chill. Through the mist, I watched as Daniel draped his coat over her, shielding her from the rain and gently helping her into the front passenger seat.

The woman smiled up at him, grabbing his tie and pulling him in for a kiss. My husband cupped her face and kissed her deeply right there in the rain. When they finally pulled apart, he tapped her nose playfully, and she tugged on his tie again, biting his lip hard.

To my surprise, instead of getting upset, he just smiled like he was

thrilled. Then, he got into the car. As the car was about to pull away, the woman rolled down the window, locking eyes with me.

She gave me a smug, taunting look and said, ‚ÄúOlivia, you‚Äôve lost.‚Äù

I smiled and shook my head. A strange calm washed over me. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, Olivia.‚Äù

Then, I whispered to myself, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs just a man, nothing more.‚Äù

As the car turned the corner, I waved. ‚ÄúDaniel, I don‚Äôt want you anymore. You‚Äôre hers.‚Äù

In that decisive moment, standing under the hospital awning, I calmly sent all the evidence I had gathered to my mentor, a well‚Äìknown divorce lawyer. I was going to secure the best future for my child, no matter what.

By the time I finished, the rain had already soaked the hem of my dress. Oddly enough, I barely noticed. Just as I put my phone away, it rang.

It was Mom.

‚ÄúOlivia, I made some soup for you and brought it to the house. Where are you and Danny? Why aren‚Äôt you home?‚Äù Her voice was filled with warmth and concern.

Before I could respond, she continued, ‚ÄúOh, that Danny. You‚Äôre this far along, and he‚Äôs still taking you out? You really need to be careful right now.‚Äù

Hearing my mom‚Äôs voice felt like a blow, like opening a floodgate I had been trying so hard to keep closed. All the pain I had been holding in grew into an overwhelming weight, pressing down on my chest. I bit down hard on my lip, fighting back the sob rising in my throat. The pain of suppressing it sent a shiver through my entire body.

‚ÄúMom, don‚Äôt worry,‚Äù I said, forcing a smile even though she couldn‚Äôt see me.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre just out having dinner.‚Äù I swallowed hard, trying to keep my voice steady. ‚ÄúOh, we‚Äôre being careful. Danny‚Äôs right here with me.‚Äù

I had to keep it together. I couldn‚Äôt let my mom hear me cry. I wouldn‚Äôt.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs raining, Mom. Drive home safely, okay? Text me when you get there.‚Äù

I hung up quickly before my voice could betray me. Once the call ended, I took a deep breath and tried to hold everything in, but no matter how hard I tried, the tears finally spilled over. I cried quietly, my body trembling under the weight of it all.

There I stood, a heavily pregnant woman, belly aching, surrounded by strangers coming and going from the hospital. And in that cold, indifferent world, I cried until I had no more tears left in me.

Chapter 4

Daniel didn‚Äôt come home that night. Instead, he only sent a text:

‚ÄòHey Olivia, I‚Äôm working late tonight and crashing into the office. It‚Äôs getting cold and rainy, so don‚Äôt forget to close the window before bed. Love you always, your husband.‚Äò

I read the message without feeling anything. In the past, I would have worried, replied, or waited for Daniel. Now, I didn‚Äôt even bother to respond. I used to think I was the happiest woman in the world because I had the best husband. But reality hit me hard. It had all been a ridiculous facade. People‚Äôs hearts are hidden behind their ribs, and their lies are scribbled on paper.

A few days later, I received the divorce papers my lawyer had drafted. I printed them out, signed my name, and started packing up my things to move back to my mom‚Äôs place. Just as I was getting ready to leave, my phone rang with an unknown number.

It was Cara.

We met at a caf√© downstairs. Cara arrived with an air of confidence, sitting across from me with a smug smile, a supermarket shopping bag by her side. Three months pregnant and balancing on thin high heels, she looked at me as if she had already won.

‚ÄúI thought you wouldn‚Äôt come,‚Äù she said, a smug lilt in her voice. ‚ÄúAfter all, you never replied to my messages.‚Äù

I smiled calmly. My heart was steady, not a flicker of emotion breaking through. ‚ÄúWhy wouldn‚Äôt I come? I haven‚Äôt done anything shameful that I need to hide.‚Äù I leaned back, still smiling. ‚ÄúBesides, Daniel and I are legally married, so I have nothing to hide. Unlike some people who, no matter how hard they try, will always be the hidden third.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou-!‚Äù she snapped, but I cut her off again.

‚ÄúOh, and thank you, by the way,‚Äù I said, my voice steady. ‚ÄúFor sending me all the evidence of your little affair with Daniel. Collecting all that would‚Äôve been much harder on my own.‚Äù

I smiled, this time more dismissively. ‚ÄúSo, this coffee‚Äôs on me.‚Äù

I placed some cash under my cup, stood up slowly, and rested my hand on my belly.

‚ÄúWhat do you mean by that?‚Äù she asked through clenched teeth as she grabbed my arm.

‚ÄúIt means I don‚Äôt want him anymore, I replied, pulling my arm free. ‚ÄúIf you want him, he‚Äôs all yours.‚Äù

Her eyes narrowed, and she threw my arm aside angrily. ‚ÄúWhat game are you playing now? Don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm buying this for a second!‚Äù

The force of her shove sent me stumbling backward, and I fell to the floor. At that moment, it felt like a knife had ripped through my belly. Pain shot through me, and I felt my body convulsed.

Blood poured from between my legs, and I screamed in terror, ‚ÄúSave my baby!‚Äù

I barely registered Cara fleeing in panic. Forcing myself to stay calm, I asked the caf√© staff to call an ambulance. By the time they lifted me into the ambulance, my dress was drenched in blood.

As my consciousness began to slip away, I heard a nurse asking for my phone password. I unlocked it for her, and they called my emergency contact, my husband, six times.

Hello everyone,

I‚Äôve recently decided that I want to start watching kdramas.
Not long ago, I came across on either TikTok or YouTube, about k-show and since I have no clue whatsoever on actors and names ‚Äî I decided to come here and ask to see if maybe someone knows what I am talking about!

So here‚Äôs my best possible description:

The drama‚Äôs about this boss and what I think is a new hire. I believe the reason why she‚Äôs there is because she‚Äôs looking into him because she likes him, and is trying to get him to fall in love with her. So again, the girl l likes him, but she‚Äôs kind of playing hard to get and avoids him most of the time. After a while, the boss becomes interested in her despite being continuously avoided. There‚Äôs a scene where boss goes to the coffee machine just to see this employee (the girl), even though he doesn‚Äôt even like coffee, and is just there to see if they run into each other (he‚Äôs seen her there). 

I might be confusing this one, but there‚Äôs also a scene where she‚Äôs carrying a bunch of heavy paperwork and she places them at the coffee station. The boss sees thinking she‚Äôs gonna grab coffee and she instantly leaves (again, playing hard to get).

Sorry for my nonsense, I tried to explain as best as I could. ü•∏",1,1736812876.0,kdramas,4,0.67,False

Review:

I think I may have found the perfect example of a flavored coffee that uses a flavor to truly enhance the experience. I'm very excited to share this with you.

Look - Beans look beautiful. Nice, chunky, round, and fully intact beans. Despite being flavored, these beans aren't overly shiney. I'm not sure how they are flavoring this, but it doesn't change the look or texture of the beans. A beautiful medium roast, maybe on the slightly darker side. When ground, the grinds look a bit lighter, almost like carob chips. The brewed coffee appears to be a true medium roast as well, nut-colored or cinnamon-colored.

Smell - A very sweet hazelnut scent. I menionted in the Bones hazelnut coffee review that I don't usually like hazelnut flavoring because it often smells too sweet or vaguely nutty with a very synthetic note to it. You don't get this in Silent Splendor. It smells like proper sweet hazelnut and it mixes very well with the coffee's natural scent and actually adds to it. Together, the scents give the impression gianduja. When brewed, the hazelnut is muted just a bit and the underlying coffee comes out more with some spiceness, nuttiness, and toffee.

Taste - A very nice cup. Hazelnut comes through, again adding to the coffee and giving the impression gianduja. This mixes well with the natural nuttiness of the coffee as well. Spice cuts into anything that would be overly sweet in the coffee. At the finish, there is a slight experience of saltiness which is interesting and not bad by any means. This mixes well with unsweetened almond milk - but don't use too much.

Feel - Light-medium bodied. Very smooth, low acidity and not very tart. The finish is short though, so you don't taste or feel the coffee quite as long as I'd like - but this just means you should drink more coffee! It's a pleasant feel, holds heat well. I just wish the finish was longer.

Overall, I feel this coffee truly has a flavor that adds to the overall experience of coffee. Perhaps they don't add as much flavor, perhaps they use a different flavor mix from other brands. But, it highlights the coffee and lets the coffee still stand on its own while being flavored and having the flavor to add just a bit of extra flavor. In general, though, I still feel flavors aren't needed in coffees. It is superfluous and certain notes, while delicious, I couldn't tell if they were coming from the coffee itself or from the flavoring. The finish would be better if longer as well. If you want a flavored coffee, this is good to have in your rotation. But, I don't think it will - nor should it - replace standard coffees.

Look - 4.5

Smell - 4.5

Taste - 4

Feel - 4

The current design is a work in progress but it is the best I can think of with the limitations of the chimney breast, outside door etc.

The plan is to knock down the wall and install an RSJ, and close up the current doorway to the kitchen.

My idea for the space to the left of the hob is to put a hanging pot / pan rack rather than a wall cabinet, to keep some of the natural light from the window. The work surfaces in front of the chimney breast would have a coffee machine and be a drinks area, with the fridge to the left being a drinks fridge. The fridge freezer to the right of the oven would be the main food fridge. I've already bought this FF and the model can be put directly next to built in ovens according to the manufacturer.

I was originally planning to fit a loo into the reno but I haven't found a layout that works, so I am now planning to either install a loo under the stairs or leave it out.

If anyone has any suggestions or thoughts of other layouts that would suit this kitchen, they would be greatly appreciated!!

In the heart of a picturesque village, surrounded by lush green hills and ancient traditions, lies the Biscotti & Aromi caf√©. Founded in 2015 by Mary, a passionate cook and coffee lover, the caf√© quickly became a landmark for both locals and visitors.

Mary, with her roots in northern Italy, brought with her ancient recipes for cookies and traditional desserts. Her passion for crafting artisanal coffee is reflected in the care with which she selects each bean, creating a unique environment where the aromas of roasted coffee and freshly baked cookies mingle in the air, drawing in anyone who passes by.

Over the years, Biscotti & Aromi has had the honor of hosting numerous famous personalities. Among the most notable visitors were actors and writers, attracted by the friendly atmosphere and authentic flavors. Once, the famous actor Marco visiting to shoot a film nearby, stopped by for a coffee and a cookie. Impressed by the quality of the coffee and the deliciousness of the treats, he praised Mary on social media, helping to introduce the caf√© to an even wider audience.

Another celebrity who spent time at Biscotti & Aromi was the writer Elena  who found inspiration for her latest novel in Mary‚Äôs stories and the caf√©'s delightful aromas. Since then, her quotes about the beauty of simplicity and authenticity at Biscotti & Aromi have become part of the caf√©'s decor.

The caf√© is adorned with a warm and welcoming atmosphere, featuring pastel-colored walls and recycled wooden tables. Every morning, customers can enjoy a selection of coffee sourced from small sustainable plantations, accompanied by a variety of cookies, from classic shortbreads to innovative savory cookies, designed to surprise the palate.

Biscotti & Aromi is not just a place to enjoy a warm beverage; it is also a community hub. Each month, the caf√© hosts tasting events, cooking workshops, and musical evenings, fostering a deep connection between residents and visitors. Mary is always eager to share the story of each ingredient, conveying the passion she puts into her work.

As the years went by, the caf√© expanded its offerings, introducing a line of teas and infusions, and collaborating with local producers to provide fresh, high-quality products. Her philosophy of sustainability and respect for the environment has won the hearts of many, making Biscotti & Aromi not just a gathering place but also a model for local commerce.

Today, Biscotti & Aromi stands as a symbol of conviviality and passion, a place where time seems to stand still, and every sip of coffee tells a story‚Äîone of love for good food and human connection. Every visit is an invitation to discover new flavors and share precious moments, making the caf√© a treasure in the heart of the community.*

*Storia Locale: Caffetteria Biscotti & Aromi**

Nel corso degli anni, Biscotti & Aromi ha avuto l'onore di ospitare numerosi personaggi celebri.

Una volta, il famoso attore Marco in visita per girare un film nelle vicinanze, si √® fermato per un caff√® e un biscotto. Colpito dalla qualit√† del caff√® e dalla bont√† dei dolci, ha elogiato Mary sui social media, contribuendo a far conoscere il locale a un pubblico ancora pi√π ampio.

Un'altra celebrit√† che ha trascorso del tempo da Biscotti & Aromi √® stata la scrittrice Elena  la quale ha trovato ispirazione per il suo ultimo romanzo nei racconti di Mary e nei profumi della caffetteria.

1i0shbj,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1i0shbj/what_i_noticed_on_and_off/,What I noticed on and off,"I'm writing this post for people perusing this sub, wondering if they should quit. 

Now please keep in mind, I am a data point of 1. This IS anecdotal. Caffeine affects everyone differently. This can be dependent on genes (we all have a gene that codes for whether we are a slow, moderate or fast metabolizer of caffeine), dose of intake, timing of intake, etc. etc. 

I am also not very unique in that I quit for months, then start again, then quit again, and so on. There are many on this sub who relapse. That said, I'd still like to share my experience because I can distinctly tell what changes occur for my body and mind when I quit and then relapse as I have done so many times. 

First point of disclosure - I am almost certainly a FAST metabolizer of caffeine. Meaning, my body breaks it down nearly instantaneously and it hits me like a wall of bricks. 

Second point of disclosure (or rather, fun information): the reason I keep relapsing is ENVIRONMENT. When I come up North for work, the coffee culture here be wilin'. EVERYONE DRINKS IT. It is therefore brewing in every office, in every home, at all times. Morning, afternoon, evening. I come up for 4-6 weeks at a time, enough time to become re-habituated to this drug (yes it's a drug, a psychoactive drug in fact!)

What happens when I relapse? MANY THINGS. Please keep in mind that this is due to just one cup, though I will often have 2 or 3 during my lapses. 

\*\*Also please note... all of the below is MY EXPERIENCE and my personal understanding of the physiological effects of caffeine. Apologies if I got something wrong, and please correct me. 

* I start sweating! And my body odour \*does not\* smell pretty. When I am OFF coffee, I don't sweat unless I am working out or in a hot environment, and my body odour is, well, odourless. 
* My resting heart rate climbs and I start having PVC's (premature ventricular contractions - a \*usually\* benign change in heart rhythm), and palpitations. This results in shortness of breath and anxiety! I notice this most when I am trying to speak to people, especially people I don't know where I get a little socially anxious and/or am presenting at work. I nearly run out of breath because my heart is going crazy. When I am OFF coffee, social anxiety disappears, I can breathe normally, I never experience PVC's or heart palpitations, my resting heart rate drops by 6-10 bpm. 
* Muscle twitching! This symptom worried me for many years. I thought I had MS or some shit and spent many a night googling this for, sadly, years. Turns out, it was just the caffeine. This was kind of a ""duh"" moment, but being in denial and the cycle of addiction will encourage you to look elsewhere for the source of symptoms. My muscle twitching almost entirely stops OFF caffeine, otherwise, I twitch every day. 
* Dehydration. This is also a kind of obvious one but DAMN is it noticeable. When I am OFF caffeine, I don't feel desperately thirsty during the day, I drink a sane and reasonable amount of water. When I'm on? I am constantly thirsty no matter how much I drink, my sleep is often disrupted just by needing to use the bathroom in the middle of the night. I pee SO MUCH MORE. Go figure. Being off caffeine offers the noticeable benefit of peeing a normal human amount in a day. 
* Skin! This ties into the above. Dehydration = your skin looks kinda shit. It loses elasticity. This is a VERY noticeable one for me. I literally look younger off caffeine because my skin doesn't wrinkle as much by.. just existing? For me, I also have WAY LESS facial redness off of caffeine. This could be due to rebound vasodilation flushing effect.
* Hair! This may have to do with cortisol release, and the cascade that creates. Stress in general. But I notice a SIGNIFICANT change in how much hair I lose in the shower. Like... a scary amount. Also, because I am SWEATING more, I have to wash my hair (ideally) every 2 days as opposed to every 3-4 when I'm off. 
* Pimples! This coincides with cortisol/adrenaline/stress as well as sweating! More sweat = more pimples. More stress = more pimples. I am 98% pimple free when I am off caffeine. When the evil demon finds me again? Pimples shall appear - face, butt, back, chest. 
* SLEEP. Okay, this probably belonged at the top of the list, but I'm too lazy to go back and put it there. It's obvious guys. We all know caffeine disrupts sleep. We can't even dispute it at this point based on the amount of research out there. Even if you ""sleep,"" your sleep is not as deep and rejuvenating as it is OFF caffeine. Me personally? I don't really know. I suck at sleeping, period. I do know one thing. I feel WAY MORE SLEEPY at night time off caffeine. I therefore fall asleep much easier. I also never wake up with anxiety which is like, huge. 
* DIGESTION!!!! Do you never have normal poops? Do you WANT normal poops? Stop drinking caffeine. I don't know what more to say other than this is very consistent. Gut health is SO important, maximizing digestion should be a priority for everyone if you want to benefit essentially.. all of the above. I honestly feel like I just absorb nutrients when I am not shitting my pants. Go figure! 
* Circulation! I thought I had Raynauds syndrome. And then, I quit caffeine. Poof, gone. Hands warm, feet warm, normal coloured skin. Caffeine is a VASOCONSTRICTER. It causes your blood vessels to contract because of the stress response. When this happens, blood is shunted to our core and away from our extremities. When I am OFF caffeine, my limbs are warm consistently. This is very important for healing! ESPECIALLY musculoskeletal injuries of the limbs. (I am still healing from an achilles tendon rupture right now.) I think we can all agree that having better circulation is massively important for multiple reasons. 
* Perhaps most important of all.... anxiety. I don't know what to say here other than my every day anxiety reduces by AT LEAST 80%. I feel calm, cool, collected. Zen, if you will. Sometimes I like to be a hyper maniac but most of the time, no thank you. 

Thank you for coming to my TED talk. These changes are 100% correlated with whether or not I am drinking caffeine,  they are therefore 100% true for me. (But maybe not for you.) And now, wish me luck on my journey to quit this drug again for the... 5th or 6th time?

1i0sh3l,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1i0sh3l/eighty_dollars/,Eighty dollars,"I have always been afraid of running out of money. As a kid, my dad lost his job more times than I could remember. Although everything always turned out alright in the end (his job had been more on the freelance side), I remember how anxious it made me feel. I always felt like we didn‚Äôt have anything to fall back on. Even as the years passed by, and my parents paid off their debt and set money aside, money became something I didn‚Äôt want to squander.¬†

I felt uncomfortable having someone pay for me when we went out for dinner. Despite being someone with a crazy long steam wishlist and enough cash to buy things in moderation because of my part time job, I would keep my money in the bank for the most part. (Though, I‚Äôll admit, I‚Äôm a sucker for iced coffee, which is where most of my money went during highschool). And I remember as a kid that when I grew out of clothing, I would put off telling my parents as if not to waste their money.

A couple days ago, I spent a lot of time with my mom getting a present ready for my boyfriend who is going to college in a state bordering ours. We‚Äôre highschool sweethearts and he‚Äôs never really had a good relationship with his family like I do with mine. So, knowing that he‚Äôs going into his Junior year of college without anyone else supporting him, my mom and I make a care package for him each semester before we send him on his way. This is something that normally is a good way to spend time with my mom after a long spring semester (as fall semesters tend to be more my thing).

Anyway, my mom was teasing me about my crazy ability to lose things. As a kid, I left more water bottles at my house on the way to school than anyone else I knew, resulting in a lot of overpriced recyclable ones I bought directly from the school. I often misplaced whatever book I was currently reading somewhere between the sheets and as if I was the kid who cried wolf, my mom would somehow make it materialize out of nowhere. There were multiple days where I would just leave my textbook in my room and have to grab one of the extra copies in the classroom. I lost everything, and nothing was more notable than the sweater incident.

I went to a private school since I was in middle school. Every private school I knew had certain rules on what you could and could not wear. The length of your skirt, the color of your hair, how many bracelets you wore on your arms: all of these rules in the name of discipline. Even now, I look back and wonder how I spent so many years without having the comfort of wearing hoodies and sweatpants every day.¬†

At any rate, it was my senior year of highschool when the Sweater incident happened. During my second semester, it started snowing more than it had ever snowed before. Although we were all happy for a supposed snow day, we all knew it was going to be colder in the halls than normal to save on utility bills. You‚Äôd think private schools would be less cheap than that but from what I‚Äôve come to realize, they seem to be more stingy that the public schools some of my friends went to.

I had approximately one sweater. It was the only design that looked good on me, and I patched it up on the elbows from the wear and tear as it belonged to my two older sisters who had since graduated. But, ever the lazy seventeen year old, I often threw it into my room without a care. Over my bed, on my desk, in my self-proclaimed ‚Äúart cart‚Äù with all the art supplies I‚Äôd gotten from Christmases and birthdays over the years. The point is, I had no clue where I put it. But I always knew where it was because it was flipped inside out somewhere in my room.

When we tell the story, it‚Äôs always about waking up on a cold, snow covered February day. I go through the motions, eating cereal for breakfast, pouring some sugary coffee, maybe coloring a coloring sheet as I try to wake up. And then I went to my room, got dressed, brushed my hair, brushed my teeth, and then I went to find my sweater. I couldn‚Äôt find it anywhere.

It was like losing a big project on the day that it was due. I couldn‚Äôt find it anywhere. Not in the dirty laundry where I could have honestly thrown it the night before, not somewhere in my sheets, not under my bed. I could not find it. I remember calling my mom downstairs, feeling guilty that I couldn't find it. But then she came into my room. She looked through my dirty laundry, moved my blankets to the side, and used a flashlight to look under my bed. She didn‚Äôt see anything either.¬†

Eventually, my older sister who lived at home, my two younger brothers, my dad, my mom, and I were all scouring my room. We found nothing. To this day, I have deep cleaned my room multiple times. There was never any evidence that I left it in my room. No wrappers of the cheese crackers I was so fond of at the time, no crumpled up post notes that I would put in my pockets that I put the date and a little homework to do list on. Nothing. My mom went and bought me a new sweater the next day.

¬†But when my mom and I were busy reminiscing, I remembered something else. To make this more understandable, I likely have ADHD and there‚Äôs this thing called executive dysfunction that just makes it a lot harder to start things than most people. Which is why, despite some of my cleaning being out of pure laziness (I will admit sometimes I just sat on my computer and watched horror movies) I had a hard time making my bed. I had a lot of blankets and stuffed animals and it was a whole process that was just hard to make myself do.¬†

I remember making my bed at some point after the incident, I‚Äôd assume around late February or March because my family‚Äôs Christian and I remember Lent just starting up. I‚Äôve always had bed covers that don‚Äôt fit perfectly (cause my mattress is shit, pardon my language) so I finally moved my pillow. As I go to move it, I‚Äôm shocked to see a folded twenty dollar bill.

We all know what a new twenty dollar bill looks like. Crisp. You pick it up and it feels *new*. The only thing that seemed off about it was that it was folded. I remember unfolding it carefully. Inside of it, I found a fifty dollar bill.

Just like anyone else, I am prone to misplacing a little bit of money. A twenty dollar bill on my ground from Christmas money is very in character for me. But I felt uncomfortable as I surveyed the money. It didn‚Äôt look like anyone had ever used it. It had one of those perfect creases that people who are good at origami can make. I can‚Äôt even make a crease to fold a piece of notebook paper in half. So for such perfect money, not accidentally marked by one of my pens, put almost perfectly folded under my pillow, made me really uncomfortable.

I didn‚Äôt even put it in my wallet. I didn‚Äôt really know what to do with it. I decided to put it on my bedside table. I don‚Äôt remember when I moved it but I probably put it into my bank account. (I was trying really hard to save money at the time).

It wasn‚Äôt till yesterday when I texted my mom to ask her how much the new sweater cost her anyway, for nostalgia's sake of course. My mom said she got it on sale with her teacher discount (some of that stuff could cost at least a hundred dollars). She told me it was only eighty dollars.

Ideally I'd find a place where I can walk or bike to a decent beginner/intermediate surf break while also being a short drive away from great city stuff. Budget is $4000/month for a 1 bedroom (home office would be a plus). Not sure whether I should be looking in North County? Or somewhere like North PB?",0,1736811957.0,asksandiego,1,0.5,False

1i0sbf6,https://www.reddit.com/r/FluentInFinance/comments/1i0sbf6/scientists_say_that_starting_work_before_10am_is/,Scientists Say That Starting Work Before 10am Is Similar To Torture,"According to Dr. Paul Kelley, a leading researcher at Oxford University, having to wake up and go to work before 10 o‚Äôclock in the morning is one of the most common forms of torture.

The Circadian Rhythm, or the internal body clock, represents the biological timers that dictate the way our body functions, and this genetically pre-programmed cycle regulates our perception of time, brain function, energy levels, and hormone production.

Therefore, waking up this early and working before 10 o‚Äôclock tortures our body and negatively affects the natural balance in the body.

Kelley explains that people cannot change their 24-hour rhythms, and one cannot learn to get up at a certain time, since the liver and your heart have different patterns and they should actually shift two or three hours.

In the early 20th century, when the 8-hour working day was introduced, along with the 24/7 factory productivity, no one considered the natural human body clock.

As a result, Dr. Paul Kelley claims that it affects the physical, emotional and performance systems and thus damages the body. Staff should start at 10 am. He also adds that people are chronically sleep-deprived, and it is an international issue.

Moreover, a week with less than six hours‚Äô sleep each night leads to 711 changes in how genes function.

He believes that the effects of work will be drastically improved if we made simple changes in the time we start and end work.

Dr. Kelley and other neuroscientists point out the importance of understanding functionality of the body at different ages, especially when it comes to sleep cycles. Sleep deprivation starts in adolescence as teens are biologically predisposed to go to sleep around midnight.

Therefore, they aren‚Äôt really awake until 10 am in the morning, and due to the strict early morning hour schedule of schools, they are losing an average of 10 hours of sleep a week. Moreover, they tend to stay awake longer into the night on weekends, so they face a difficulty to constantly readjust to the early-to-bed, early-to-rise sleep cycle that is structured for a 55-year-old.

A British school tested Dr.Kelley‚Äôs theory that schools should start from 8.30 am to 10.00 am, and after some time, the grades of the students were significantly increased, and as well as their attendance and general productivity.

Therefore, if we decide to incorporate such changes in all sectors of the modern society, people will undoubtedly become more productive, happier, healthier, full of energy and joy, instead of being fatigued, stressed, and addicted to coffee.

1i0sbcm,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1i0sbcm/issue_with_actions_vs_words_with_boyfriend/,Issue with actions vs words with boyfriend‚Ä¶.,"I‚Äôm 36F divorced with a young son. My boyfriend of 8 months is 37M, divorced with two teenagers. My bf was the sole provider for his family since he was 18. 

They got pregnant at 18, got married and she was a stay at home mom from age 18-36 when she asked for a divorce because she wanted ‚Äúto be free‚Äù and she believed she could find better out there. (She hasn‚Äôt) He worked his ass off his entire life and his family has lived in moderate luxury their whole lives. Meaning they aren‚Äôt rich by any means but spending $300 on fireworks for Fourth of July, taking multiple vacations every year, the kids getting massive amounts of Christmas gifts, they are used to going out to eat several nights a week. She did things like bought a $2,000 dog without even asking him and booked a cruise for a family of five without consulting him. Etc. 


Anyways. My boyfriend is proud to be a provider. He does a dirty, blue collar job that just happens to pay well. He has talked about how it makes him feel good to take care of those he loves and he doesn‚Äôt let me pay for any dates. He talks about wanting to take me on a trip somewhere expensive in 2025. He still gives his ex a massive amount of money every month outside of child support because she can‚Äôt function as an adult on her own. He still pays her phone bill, car payment (it‚Äôs in his name) and car insurance. He also buys groceries for her house and sends her money any time she asks. He sent her $1,000 when she was behind on rent and he paid her rent for December so she could afford Christmas for the kids. 

So what‚Äôs the issue? Well, I‚Äôm a single mom. I‚Äôve worked my whole life. I was married to a loser who for much of our marriage was unemployed or worked part time retail jobs. I was in the Army for a long time to support our family. When we divorced I never asked him for anything. I‚Äôve paid my own way and I don‚Äôt get child support or alimony (50/50 custody). I have bad credit and debt but I‚Äôm overall responsible and work hard to take care of us on my own. My boyfriend has been adamant about ‚Äúwanting to take care of me‚Äù. At first I was uncomfortable about it. I‚Äôve never not paid for dates etc. I return the favor by cooking for him- I‚Äôve definitely spent as much on groceries cooking him awesome meals (I was a professional cook). He says it makes him feel really special that I cook for him. I fix his plate, set the table, bring him dessert etc because I know his ex never treated him like that. I bought him gifts like a bracelet, a Stanley cup he liked, a new belt, two orders of clothes online because he lost a lot of weight before we met and needed clothes but hates shopping. I also bought him a copy of my therapy work book because he needs therapy lol from his ex destroying his self esteem over the years. I‚Äôve also gone out of my way to get his favorite treats from a couple local bakeries.


 I struggle a lot financially. I‚Äôm behind on my rent and insurance. I started driving for uber and I work side gigs in catering. I‚Äôve mentioned to him that it‚Äôs common for me to behind on one bill so I can pay another. I borrowed money from him twice- once for an emergency vet bill, and once when my insurance pulled before my paycheck deposited. I paid him back both times, one the very next day and the other when I got paid two weeks later.

 He‚Äôs never offered to just pay a bill or sent me money to go ‚Äútreat myself‚Äù or pay a bill with or anything. I asked him for, and received, flowers for my birthday back in the summer. The other day I was delivering a bouquet to someone and I sent him a photo that it was cute someone used uber to deliver flowers. He immediately started apologizing and said he was remiss in not having bought me flowers more often and how I deserve flowers. Since then, I‚Äôve not received any flowers. 


When I mentioned how my crock pot was tiny (it‚Äôs a dorm size one) he sent pics of crockpots and asked me to tell him which one I liked and he would buy it for me. Months later, no crock pot. A few days ago I bought myself a new purse (mine was several years old and I got it at Ross lol) he said he had just been looking at buying me a new bag from a fandom I‚Äôm in. The bag is about $20. I told him I liked it. That‚Äôs been it on that front so far. When we go to the smoke shop (nicotine) he doesn‚Äôt offer to pay for my stuff when we check out. If we go to Walmart, he‚Äôs never offered to pay for the purchase even when it‚Äôs stuff for me to cook for him.


 Today I sent him a link to something I want to do for our first Valentine‚Äôs Day- a local orchestra concert of love songs. He said he‚Äôll definitely get us good seats but could we not go to a fancy dinner too as he had to also get something nice for his daughter for Valentine‚Äôs Day too. I told him I never expected a fancy dinner also and that the orchestra was the date in my opinion. 

He rubs my feet, just yesterday he paid for us to get coffee, go to the art museum and get dinner with my friends on a double date. He‚Äôs scratches my back all the time and kisses me. He showers me in compliments and affection. He talks about how lucky he is all the time. But he also talks about how much being a provider makes him happy, he loves having his woman not have to work if she doesn‚Äôt want to, he wants to spoil me, etc. He also talks about how money isn‚Äôt an issue for him, again he‚Äôs not rich but he does well. He makes half my pay check in a day. 


Here‚Äôs the thing. I don‚Äôt REQUIRE gifts and money. I‚Äôm not gonna break up with him cuz I didn‚Äôt get flowers or a crock pot or a purse lol. Or even that he knows I struggle with bills and sees me working side hustles to get by. I‚Äôve worked my whole life, I don‚Äôt NEED anything handed to me. I‚Äôm just‚Ä¶.. üòÖ I guess getting a bit frustrated by all the talk about how money isn‚Äôt an issue and he loves being a provider but like‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ where?? Where is it for me lol?? 


We‚Äôve said I love you for months now and are talking about moving in together when my lease is up. How can I bring this up without it looking like I‚Äôm being materialistic? It‚Äôs not that I need these things, it just feels like his words and actions don‚Äôt match. And I see him still doing a lot financially for his ex because the kids live with her but I can‚Äôt help but be frustrated that I struggle with bills but he‚Äôs paying his ex wife‚Äôs phone bill every month. We‚Äôve only been dating for 8 months so I don‚Äôt want to come off crazy or gold digging etc. he‚Äôs been a really great boyfriend. And I don‚Äôt NEED these things. But he‚Äôs said things like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand why your ex didn‚Äôt appreciate you more‚Äù and all the talk about providing for his  woman is starting to make me feel some kind of way. 


Narrator: she did not keep it short and probably couldn‚Äôt if her life depended on it üòÇ 


TLDR: boyfriend says he loves being a financial provider, but doesn‚Äôt actually financially provide for me in our relationship outside of paying for dates. However we‚Äôve only been together for 8 months. Feels like his actions don‚Äôt match his words. ",2,1736811910.0,relationships,5,1.0,False

I find places like Collectivo, Inteligentsia, metropolis, etc to all taste much better. However, I‚Äôm always so confused when folks say Starbucks tastes burnt and then go on to proclaim their love of McDonalds or Dunkin. McDonalds is so bad I‚Äôm convinced they must be using half as many beans as is necessary and then leaving the pot on the warmer all day. Dunkin‚Äô isn‚Äôt much better. I‚Äôd take a venti blonde roast from Starbucks any day over anything I can get from the other two big players. To me, it tastes much closer to what I can get from the more premium spots or what I make at home in my chemex.

I came to understand one thing is that the grinder is more important than a machine. But here is the caveat, we want a more automatic machine like Breville Barista touch impress. But then I would have to invest in a decent grinder right ? 

Or should I go with Bambino with a DF54 grinder. But the only issue is how manual the entire process would be with this option compared to the previous one.

1i0s7od,https://www.reddit.com/r/letters/comments/1i0s7od/my_love_now_buried/,"my love, now buried.","Dear diary,

I was in a long-distance relationship with someone I originally met online, roughly 6 or 7 years ago. We were together (as in romantic lovers) for just over a year. 
Before then, we had never met, but were still very close friends online. Before we‚Äôd actually met, although we were young and questioning the world, we‚Äôd always have insightful conversations about random intellectual topics, such as social issues and commentaries. I‚Äôm not even sure why we‚Äôd do this, but every time we‚Äôd connect it‚Äôd be to discuss the world, what‚Äôs wrong with it, and our perspectives on it. We‚Äôd go months without texting each other, but when we‚Äôd end up re-connecting, all the same familiar feelings would return. Whether it was email, WhatsApp, letters, we‚Äôd always find a way to connect after a while. 
To be honest, looking back, we did fantasise about getting together, getting married, making beautiful poetic love, but at that age (we were probably about 15-16 and hopeless teenage romantics) we sort of accepted that it‚Äôd remain a fantasy. Anyway, we‚Äôd update each other about our separate lives, send each other updates in pictures, and we both just really found it refreshing to reconnect. We were really just two people who never really fit into mainstream culture - we didn‚Äôt really like the idea of using social media or the culture of internet at all. For this reason, like I said before, we communicated through SMS, or emails. It was just this string of familiarity in someone so far away, yet felt so close.

Untillllll‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ we became adults (18), and we decided to finally meet in person. Once we did meet, (I have goosebumps as I‚Äôm writing this) man I‚Äôm telling you it was like a dream. 
She met me at the train station, and I was greeted with this massive tree-hug. She led me to the hotel id be staying at, and once I checked in, and we went to my room, she physically could not stop smiling. It was so fucking cute but at the time I was also a little concerned. She literally did not stop smiling for the next hour, it was like she‚Äôd just taken some crazy drugs. Looking back, I guess she was just so overcome with joy and happiness that her body elicited ak automatic response. How cute is that :,) 

So yeah, We were hugging, kissing holding hands. All the time waiting to finally see the person I knew so well but had never seen in the flesh came upon us, and we were just in this bubble of happiness, warmth and ecstasy for the next three days while I was there. (She lived in a city a couple hundred miles away) 
When the first day was over, she said to me that she genuinely couldn‚Äôt believe that I was real. 
On the third day, we had a little coffee date before I got my return train. We were just talking about life, and I think about our opinions on ‚Äúdepression‚Äù as a scientific concept against it as a societal construct. Whilst she wa talking I saw that she had a diary in her bag, so I asked her if I could write in it. She seemed quite surprised but pleased, and let me write in it. I wrote a few pages of romantic / poetic affectionate stuff and drew her a rough biro pen picture of some flowers. Before I could show her, I remember her saying that she needed the bathroom and she‚Äôd be back in a sec. When she got back, I was pretty sure she‚Äôd looked like she‚Äôd just been crying, so I moved to her side of the table and cuddled her, and asked her what was wrong. She said to me that she just wants me to know that there‚Äôs some very horrible and bad men out there, and that no matter what happens between us, ‚Äúyou really set the bar‚Äù. I felt my heart skip a beat when she told me this, and the words didn‚Äôt really resonate, but I told her that I‚Äôm just being me. I care about her and I‚Äôm just treating her how I‚Äôd treat someone I deeply care about. Looking back although I don‚Äôt cry at all it makes me quite emotional thinking about that moment. 

So yeah, following that first meeting We had a beautiful long - distance relationship. She lived a couple hundred miles away, but we managed to make it work for the year. Whilst at university, I also worked all month, and when I‚Äôd get paid at the end of the month I‚Äôd use that money to book a hotel for a few days in her city and we‚Äôd spend time together every couple months. Everything was perfect. We were in love like a film. She was a v*rgin (completely untouched, without being too crude or sensitive) before we eventually engaged in intercourse, and every time we‚Äôd make love it was like a picturesque dream for the both of us. As you have the picture, we were both very very in love. 
There were times she‚Äôd cry, out of love for me, as she‚Äôd explain that she‚Äôd never imagined for there to be a man as good as I was to her, and she was ever grateful that I was in her life. I loved it so much - we‚Äôd never go a day without communicating, texting or calling, and she really did love me. It was quite like a renaissance painting, or a Mozart piece; seamless and formed. We weren‚Äôt the average couple, we enjoyed making beautiful  poetry, and spent a lot of time doing things like having picnics and walking and talking. Life was just fucking awesome. 

So now the sad bit : in the summer 2024, about a month after we‚Äôd last seen each other since, and when we‚Äôd just celebrated a year of being together, she‚Äôd started having doubts about me, saying that she‚Äôd lost feelings and hasn‚Äôt felt the same affectionate way she‚Äôd usually feel. Bear in mind, we were in a long-distance relationship, so although it was a huge shock to hear, I assumed that the distance was just a bit much for her, so told her I‚Äôd come to see her the following week, so we‚Äôd be able to have a real conversation in person about how she was currently feeling. To my surprise, as soon as I turned up, and she was in front of me, she immediately said she wanted to apologise, and cried her eyes and heart out. She leant forward and leaned into me, crying into my shoulder and repeatedly saying sorry. She said that, although she wasn‚Äôt sure what the future would bring, she was sure that in the present moment she wanted me, and knew that for a fact. Alas, the next few days we spent rekindling our love, and she‚Äôd constantly tell me how happy she is that we‚Äôre together. She was to start university in the coming September x and we looked into the universities she‚Äôd wanted to go to together. 
Eventually, we found one, and although it was very far away from where I am studying, we were just happy that we were successful in getting her a place. 
She was evermost grateful that I was there, and kept saying to me that if I wasn‚Äôt there, she wasn‚Äôt sure how she‚Äôd have gotten into university at all, due to how upset she was after finding out her grades. When I left to go back home, she messaged me and said she was ever so grateful for the patience I showed, and was so grateful for our relationship. It honestly felt like we were back to normal again- our normal being this poetic and beautiful love that we both connected to each other through. Fast forward 2 weeks, she moves away to university. I move back to university too, far away though from her, where I study medicine. 
The first week of her moving in, she doesn‚Äôt respond to many of my messages nor call me at all, but I didn‚Äôt think much of it because I‚Äôd thought I‚Äôd give her time to settle in. After the second week, she‚Äôd still continued to ignore me, so I called her a few times, as I was now quite worried. She didn‚Äôt answer, but she eventually texted me back, after I‚Äôd text her all night. She said she just needed to have a think, and was on a walk. After not speaking to me for so long I was so confused why her first message was this, so as her worried boyfriend I continued to call her. She answered on the 6th attempt, and simply just said to me that she‚Äôd met someone at university, and it was something she‚Äôd really want to pursue. Upon hearing this I was in a shock, and said something like ‚Äúgood luck to you both‚Äù and hung up the phone. After a couple hours I did call her back, because I needed a full explanation and some closure about this situation. Just over 2 weeks ago, we‚Äôd met and were making love, and she was telling me how much she loved and cherished me. Now she was saying she‚Äôd met someone else within a week of moving to university. During the phone call she was very brash and dismissive, and pretty much just said to me that he was her flatmate and that she was attracted to him and was no longer attracted to me anymore. She said she‚Äôd spent some time getting to know him and his background and felt an immense feeling towards him and wanted to pursue it. She said a few times that she doesn‚Äôt love me anymore and upon asking her if she was certain she said she was certain. I was sure that if I got to see her another time she‚Äôd change her mind but she said to me that this time was different, and that she was ‚Äúchanging‚Äù. She said she was ‚Äúgrowing‚Äù, and was ‚Äúout into the world now‚Äù and just wanted to ‚Äúbe‚Äù. I wasn‚Äôt sure at all what any of this meant but I just had to accept it. I wished her luck, and she‚Äôd said she wanted to lose my phone number, and asked if this was okay. I wasn‚Äôt sure at all why she‚Äôd do this, but I said it‚Äôs up to her. This happened over a month ago, and it‚Äôs since been my birthday, and also hers. I‚Äôm 20 now, and she‚Äôs 19. I feel very sad about it all, and can‚Äôt stop thinking about the beautiful times we‚Äôd shared, and how she‚Äôd stepped out so suddenly. 
Because of the sheer nature of our relationship, I have a feeling that she‚Äôll end up feeling regretful, and reaching out eventually. But part of me also thinks that that is wishful thinking. Since the phone conversation she‚Äôs not spoken to me at all, and many thoughts raced my mind the weeks after the break up -  Why would it take a week of moving out to destroy a beautiful and wonderful relationship - one we had since we were children? What‚Äôs this matter about ‚Äúgrowing‚Äù and being ‚Äúout into the world‚Äù?  At the time I thought she‚Äôd made a very impulsive choice. But now, I have had a few months to reflect, and I‚Äôll cite my reflections below:

I still think about us a lot. Notably, none of it is sexual, either. In fact, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever thought of her in that sort of way since she broke up with me, nor is it that l that my mind misses and yearns for. Instead, constantly think about the pleasant times we‚Äôd had, the laughs, the giggles, calling her every day after boxing training to tell her how it went. 
Sending her my fights, eagerly waiting to tell her that I‚Äôd won / lamenting to her when I‚Äôd lose. 
I can see why she did it. She‚Äôs 300+ miles away now, at the other side of the country. I‚Äôm doing a 5-year medical degree. Time just won‚Äôt help us progress together. She wants to explore the world and what‚Äôs in it, and I‚Äôm nobody to take that away from her at all. At the end of the day, we are still SO young, I do see that. But at the same time, we had such a wonderful relationship. 
Sometimes I question me, myself. What‚Äôs wrong with me that she doesn‚Äôt love me anymore? Is it me? Am I just ugly now that she‚Äôs seen other men? Surely not, she‚Äôs more insightful than that. But why? I‚Äôm a boxer, I‚Äôve come up from poverty and now I‚Äôm going to be a doctor. Surely she would want such a man? 
Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôve had ample opportunity to pursue other people, but my mind repels me from it. 
I don‚Äôt know what to do, and sometimes I want to call her to reconnect, other times I think to leave it and to let her live her life and get her degree. 
Should I make contact? Maybe she regrets it now?",1,1736811621.0,letters,1,1.0,False

1i0s598,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1i0s598/gm_thoughts_on_duelist_balance/,GM thoughts on duelist balance,"TL;DR Psylocke needs a nerf. 

Okay. I know what you‚Äôre going to say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm mad, I‚Äôm bad, I'm salty, I need to get gud‚Äù.

I get it, and fuck it, yeah you're right.

But hear me out, I made it to GM last season and tbh I‚Äôm not the best player. Duelist is my worst win rate, if I play an actual duelist that requires some aim like Hela the games are hard, I have to be playing very well and my aim needs to be on point. 

""But Coffee, Hela is broken, if you can't do well on Hela you're just bad"" Okay maybe I am ass at the game.

Not with Psylocke though. You can be complete ass at the game (like me) and be mvp/svp almost every game. I do insanely well on this character and it's because her kit gives you so much freedom to pick your fights and escape whenever you want for free.

This is sort of my main gripe, a lot of duelists actually require a lot of risk reward or they have to have really good aim to do perform well (other than maybe moon knight? but he has direct counters so I'm less worried about him, the main one being Psylocke). 

Duelists usually follow one of the 2 of these criteria. You either have high risk high reward (i.e. Spiderman) or you are a backline duelist that relies on having really good aim to be effective (Hela, Hawkeye). 

Psylocke breaks this.

The Psylocke gameplan is simple. You can just flank and instantly kill any squishy in one combo, usually super easy to do (even if your aim is ass) especially since you can just sneak up behind them. You just do this until the enemy starts respecting this. If the enemy team starts playing better against flanks and respecting you. Congrats, you already made a giant impact in the game, you added a metric fuck ton of pressure on the enemy team and therefore made space for your team by making them terrified (as they should be).

Once this happens you just swap to decimating the front line and build ult (which she does very well). Then when they aren't scared, you swap back to flanking, it's very easy. Also on some maps if there isn't a very obvious or easy way to flank you just play the map and play more mid/front line and build meter (which she's also insanely good at, she also does high damage to tanks).

Which brings me to my next point. 

Her ult is too good. 

The range is insane, you can move in it, it decimates a back line, it‚Äôs versatile since you‚Äôre invulnerable, it lasts awhile so by the time it ends your cds are going to be back up, like all across the board it‚Äôs fucking insane. Just by playing psylocke the enemy supports have to save their ult or big cds to live, just for you. If they didn't save cds that fight is chalked and it's a team wipe.

At least with Hela you have time to LOS it, strange can jump up and block it, you can kill her if your team is coordinated or if you got like a punisher ult going or something, etc. Don't get me wrong, Hela ult is very powerful, Psylocke's ult is better though AND she also generates her ult at least twice as fast as Hela.

What should they nerf then? 

Something meaningful. It could be anything where you nerf her actual ult by removing her ability to move in it, smaller range, takes longer to build it up, reduce damage, etc. 

If you don't want to touch her ult you could also make it so she generates her dashes slower, more cd on her invis, less burst damage on right click.

Just pick something, preferably multiple things I mentioned.

She's much too low risk and way too high reward, then that's just exacerbated by how easy she is to play, like I said I'm a negative 50% win rate duelist player, but with Psylocke I have a 65% win rate on her with 50+ games.

Okay that‚Äôs the constructive part, this is the petty part and I just need to get this off my chest.

The egos on some psylocke one tricks are ***INSANE*** (at least at my rank) who think they some **god** at the game by getting 30 kills and only dying once or twice. Like yeah, no shit, that characters kit is overtuned and it‚Äôs almost impossible to die. Dude, I‚Äôm ass and even I can pop off of Psylocke all the time, she‚Äôs just insane. 

I've made a toxic habit of going to Psylocke players accounts and when they play other duelists they struggle very hard. Even ‚Äúbroken‚Äù characters like Hela and Hawkeye. It‚Äôs because despite what people say, you have to actually be good at the game and have pretty decent aim to pop off on those characters. 

That's why if you've ever noticed you get Hela and Hawkeye players all the time on your team that do terrible, but it actually very rarely happens to Psylocke players. Pay attention to your next bunch of games you play.

Anyway that‚Äôs my rant. Psylocke is dumb, please nerf her somehow.",0,1736811435.0,marvelrivals,16,0.4,False

After the workout, within an hour, I started to feel anxious, with a lot - but a lot of adrenaline. I ate a meal with chicken breast as always and as I got out of the place I‚Äôm eating at, my heart started racing. I started walking, without knowing where I‚Äôm going to. Walked so fast like 30 km/h. 

I felt high. The world seem like I‚Äôm high. My heart was racing on 155 and my mind was going insane. All the thoughts in my head was racing with worries and anxiety. 

Stopped on some park nearby. Set on some bench and thought I should breathe to slow down my heart. But it wouldn‚Äôt stop racing. Even when I set down for a couple of minutes, it kept racing. My hands were itching, like there are ants on it. And I felt like I had some kind of a heart attack.

Me (24M) fianc√© (23F) together since 27/12/2015 

Basically I lived with my fianc√© at her parents house whilst doing my plumbing and gas apprenticeship for the last 3 years 

Rewind to July 2024 we had recently come back from a 2 week family Holiday in Greece as far as I‚Äôm aware she was fine on holiday we had a great time maybe a couple arguments as couples do.

Then not long after I noticed her not being herself even though we lived together we would still send each other a text usually me first sometimes her saying ‚ÄúI love you, I hope that you have a great day see you soon‚Äù
Or ‚Äúhow is your day‚Äù and they slowly turned into me being left on delivered I didn‚Äôt see it being much of an issue but after some time I thought it was strange considering it was an everyday thing no matter what, basically routine and then stopped the random kisses, hugs, ‚ÄúI love yous‚Äù and intimacy 
Which made me feel slightly insecure, ignorant old me thought she must be going through a hard time so I asked and told her that if anything‚Äôs on her mind then feel free to talk about it as I‚Äôm her for her whenever she needs

So I started to make more effort to make her life easier, making her tea and prepping her lunch for work, making her a coffee everyone morning, this went on for weeks until one night I said ‚Äúplease can you make abit more effort for me as I feel like you‚Äôre not being as attentive‚Äù 

She said ‚Äúyes I‚Äôll try to make more effort‚Äù and then hugged me tight as we went to sleep the next day she went to a concert with her friend for the weekend and then went to Smithers friends after coming back for a trial shift to try another job during all of this she was still leaving me on delivered even though she would be active a lot and around me always on her phone, so I felt kinda mad and upset at this point and then a day before she came back she said ‚Äú would you like to get a McDonald‚Äôs for tea‚Äù it was a work night so it was out of the ordinary Doing something on a work night as we usually stick to a routine, so I stupidly assumed she wants to make more effort.

She drove us towards McDonalds, 45 minutes away from her house the whole journey she was being very quiet and quite off, something didn‚Äôt add up in my mind we drive past McDonald‚Äôs towards my mums house she said ‚ÄúI just need to collect some clothes‚Äù we pulled up outside and she said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry I can‚Äôt do this anymore‚Äù (along with some other things that just weren‚Äôt really a valid reason to end an 8 year relationship) and I was raging, I had just been deceived and my heart broken long story short I begged pleaded, bought her stuff to try make everything right and after a week we were back together. 

I then put effort into a lot more, taking her out for food, to the cinema doing more activities etc. and really worked to try and be the best I could be even started saving for a holiday to take just me and her away on her birthday in April this year which she had been aware of.

I really worked on myself and tried to not act out of emotion and get so annoyed, frustrated or stressed about things.

We usually have this cheap thing we do on a Friday night called pizza Friday where we will buy a nice frozen pizza from Tesco along with a lot of snacks and a drink and watch something on Netflix after work, we loved it, it was our end of week routine.

I then noticed she was being a little bit off or not putting as much effort in, I then would communicate with her and say ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not saying I love you anymore really without me saying it‚Äù 

Along with a couple other things it always seemed like I was initiating everything and if I didn‚Äôt I‚Äôd receive no reassurance.

She would reply with ‚Äúyou‚Äôre making me feel guilty and making me feel like I‚Äôm a shit person‚Äù I would reassure her and say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not trying to make you feel guilty it‚Äôs just that I‚Äôd like you to put abit more effort in‚Äù 

Then it just became more and more almost like she was deactivating and then that would make me more insecure and then I would communicate and try more it was just a cycle and then she started playing pool and having a drink on a Friday and not get back till late so our ‚Äúpizza Friday‚Äù which we never missed out on started to become a distant memory of the past 

And then more insecurity would grow from me and more deactivation from her

I then said one morning we need a serious chat, I drove us in the car to a spot and just expressed everything and said ‚ÄúI‚Äôve made a lot more effort this time round and I know my values and I don‚Äôt want to walk away but I need you to understand how I feel‚Äù

I explained everything and she just wasn‚Äôt keeping eye contact and cried abit

I said what‚Äôs up with you why are you being like this distant and have no remorse for how you‚Äôre making me feel I asked what I had done wrong or if anything I‚Äôve done has made her withdraw her feelings from me and I just asked that she‚Äôd try to be more empathetic and to put a bit of effort to say ‚Äú I love you ‚Äú and hug and kiss me and be intimate with me.

She said it was too much stress and she ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt want to be in a relationship‚Äù she wants to ‚Äúbe single‚Äù she need to ‚Äúfind herself‚Äù and ‚Äúfigure out who‚Äôs she is‚Äù and ‚Äúwhat she wants‚Äù all classic fearful avoidant reasons

And then broke up with me on the drive home I said ‚ÄúI was looking forward to going to the Christmas markets to get food and go shopping with you and spend my 2 weeks off from Christmas with you‚Äù and she said ‚Äúso was I‚Äù how does that make sense, that was on the 14th of December 13 days before our 9 years of being together date.

FYI she never had a problem before any of this to show how much she loves me it‚Äôs just the last 6 months has been a real moment of her withdrawing and being hot and cold 

Since breaking up Ive been doing a lot of research and came to the realisation shes a fearful avoidant and a lot of stuff that didn‚Äôt make sense early on in our relationship and leading up to now makes so much more sense

Since breaking up this time I‚Äôve gone to her house begged for her to take me back promised commitment and a good future and yes it‚Äôs not helped she‚Äôs treat me like I‚Äôm a stranger messages are abrupt 

Until last Friday I said to her that I need to see her as it‚Äôs not fair that she‚Äôs discarded me and trying to cut me off for good considering we have a dog and a cat and we‚Äôre both liked/loved by each others family 

After some serious crying and emotional explanation she said  she‚Äôll meet me ‚Äúas friends‚Äù only for me but since seeing. Her I can tell in her eyes there‚Äôs still feeling and that she still loves me 

She said if I make her feel uncomfortable like try to kiss her or hold her hand she‚Äôll cut me off from seeing her 
 
So anyway the next day I asked if I could come over and see her, she was fine with it strangely enough, even though she had good poisoning I took her some medication and she let me stay for tea we watched 2 films I was there for 8 hours and she said how appreciative she was for me looking after her we hugged before I left for a little while and she held on for longer hinging me more 

the next day I asked if I could see her again she said yes and I stayed for 9 hours had tea again and we watched 4 films but she seemed quite within herself towards the end I always remind her that if I make her feel uncomfortable or outstaying my welcome to let me know 

That was yesterday we both hugged and thanked each other and she‚Äôs not messaged me at all today am I overthinking it? 

Before she agreed to start meeting me the messages were abrupt and I was initiating the contact
But since meeting she seemed really grateful of my presence as have I been but I‚Äôd like to see if she‚Äôll initiate contact as I just want to be with her again and reconnect but I can‚Äôt do it if she won‚Äôt somewhat show interest 

Sorry for the long story any questions ask below but any advice will be appreciated

1i0rq26,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/1i0rq26/update_going_on_a_second_date_with_a_perfect_on/,Update: Going on a second date with a perfect on paper guy‚Ä¶terrified tbh,"Update with OG post below.

My gut is like ‚ÄùAbort! Abort! Abort!‚Äù Second date went perfectly well but this guy‚Ä¶something feels ‚Äúmissing‚Äù. I don‚Äôt get that little rush of excitement\butterflies that I feel when I‚Äôm attracted to and into someone. I don‚Äôt find myself compelled to want to know every little detail about him, his mom, his dog, his past and future. In my gut I know when I like someone. But he‚Äôs a perfectly wonderful person. He even brought me flowers for my birthday. Insisted on opening doors etc.

I also really value laughter over everything else and I haven‚Äôt had those big belly laughs from things he‚Äôs said to me. I see myself with someone who has a sense of humor akin to mine. 

He very pointedly deleted his dating apps in front of me to show me he was doing it (which felt very awkward and I didn‚Äôt do the same because it‚Äôs only a second date and I‚Äôm still feeling him out). We also got down to brass tacks on how he knows he comes on strong after one date and that he knows that for the right person it won‚Äôt seem that way. Which I personally agreed with and feel the same way in my own search for my person. I introduced him to the term ‚Äúlimerence‚Äù (big for ADHDers) and told him that he had been overwhelming me with his almost constant messaging after our first date . But that I understand it and that‚Äôs it‚Äôs been interesting to be in the receiving end of that as someone who behaves similarly towards crushes. 

He also made a few comments about future things like traveling with me and made a bit of a (üò≥) strange comment eluding comment to marriage. Asked me if I wanted kids bc my profile says ‚Äúnot sure‚Äù. And while cuddling would say things like, ‚Äúhey, you‚Äôre amazing, beautiful, smart and so kind.‚Äù

He *barely* knows me though üò£

I had a dream last night after our second date that I couldn‚Äôt get the brakes to work while driving his work van. Big sign from my ol melon that I‚Äôm anxious about this all and feel out of control.

He‚Äôs a good looking guy, a perfect gentleman but there‚Äôs just that ‚Äúthing‚Äù missing. When we kissed I didn‚Äôt feel anything and I know that means something. A date I went on a few weeks ago was with a very funny, easy going guy who I was attracted to and I felt that little rush of excitement when we kissed. With my last partner I ignored this feeling of ‚Äúthe missing thing‚Äù and figured my attraction and love would grow in time. I‚Äôm not sure I want to risk that again and end up hurting the both of us. 

OG POST:

This is the 4th guy I‚Äôve met via OLD and I‚Äôve been single since June after a LTR ended and I‚Äôve only just started going on dates so I‚Äôm new to it entirely. My whole 20s and early 30s were spent with the wrong man. 

I was kinda ‚Äúmeh‚Äù on this guys profile (not bad looking just not my immediate attraction type) and was taking the advice of ‚Äúmeet up anyway, maybe his pics are trash and he‚Äôs actually an undercover hottie.‚Äù lol

Invited him last minute to go bowling with me as I go alone usually.

Shows up, little awkward but that‚Äôs expected. Giving big big Youth Pastor vibes, very straight laced but then we dive in and he‚Äôs into all sorts of music that I like, has tattoos and piercings. Kinda blew my mind like someone put a Bible jacket over a smutty romance novel.

Now the thing that‚Äôs freaking me out is how kind, open and forward he is. Knows what he wants, states it clearly and has a 10 year plan. Basically, I met a real man out in these streets lol and it made me feel inadequate and scared.

He‚Äôs been chatting to me almost constantly since our last date (another planned for today) and it has felt overwhelming and too intense at times BUT also exactly how I feel but don‚Äôt say aloud when I meet someone I‚Äôm really into.

I‚Äôm not sure how I feel towards him attraction-wise but there was a moment like ‚Äúüòèü•µ‚Äù when my stomach did a little backflip at the end of our first date. After mentioning it was getting late and I was tired, a yawn escaped and he said ‚Äúc‚Äômon, let‚Äôs get ya home.‚Äù And I knew he wasn‚Äôt about to drop me off and try to ‚Äúcome upstairs for coffee‚Äù.

Basically his approach has been very FULL SEND and his language has been super flowery towards me for a guy that doesn‚Äôt know me terribly well. He‚Äôs also said that he knows he probably coming off as love bombing and really doesn‚Äôt mean to be.

A lot of what he said he‚Äôs looking for romantically and relationship-wise is exactly what I want and I know he‚Äôs the kind of guy that would build a ladder and pull the moon out of the sky for the right woman. For some reason he thinks I‚Äôm pretty cool. 

I‚Äôm‚Ä¶kinda terrified? ",0,1736810278.0,datingoverthirty,4,0.17,False

Of course Cheese, butter and salt were all great. 

For the coffee, which had the most interest - it was meh.  Just tasted like a crappy cup of coffee.   It really removed a lot of the coffee flavor, and made it seem like strong coffee - but with no flavor.  

The chocolate was a mixed reaction - to me I think the answer is, if you‚Äôre going to be cold smoking something anyway it‚Äôs worth throwing a chocolate bar on just to see for yourself.  Definitely give it a day to mellow a bit vs right out of the smoker.    It did give it some flavor, the first hit of flavor to me was a bit much - then when the chocolate flavor comes in with it it‚Äôs not bad.   Wife and son couldn‚Äôt get past the first taste, but they also only tried it right off the smoker.    Someone else that tried it really liked it.  

So there‚Äôs the update that a few will care about!",2,1736810230.0,u_jakecantrell,0,1.0,False

I drank too much coffee this morning and couldn't stabilize my hands. The linework I did with my 3RL was noticeably shaky and fucking terrible. Normally I have a really steady hand but not today, I don't fuckin know why. By the end of the tattoo I noticed several spots where I absolutely fucked up so bad, and she noticed too. The tattoo was the length of her shin, so it's SUPER noticeable in some spots. 

I feel so fuckin ashamed right now and I'm taking myself apart over here. Have any of you had this happen? I know you win some, you lose some, but I just put some shitty artwork into someone and I feel really, really guilty about it. ",17,1736809842.0,tattooscratchers,8,0.84,False

1i0rj8o,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i0rj8o,Stain Removal Prior to Dye & Dyes for Blended Fabrics,"I want to dye this dark blue/green. I yoinked it from my mum's giveaway closet; A few years old, washed many times. I do not know what was done for stain removal, if anything.

I do not know the cause of the stain. Knowing my mum, it could literally be anything from coffee to gum arabic. The fabric is slightly stiffer around the stain which makes me think it might be coffee.

Anyways, my questions!!

1. What do you recommend for treating stains, with an eye to dying (so not good enough to look the same, I want it to pick up dye the same as well)?

2. I want to dye this dark blue or green. I am thrown off by the varied fibre content (copied below and shown in photos). I was almost thinking it would be cool to do dark green synthetic dye and a lighter blue/aquamarine all purpose dye. I have both from Rit in liquid form (inherited from a family member's craft closet).

""My dearest Drea,

My hope is that someday, it‚Äôs you who discovers this letter. Adrian can be impulsive and unpredictable, and I have no idea what he might do in the future.

Drea, my little spark, my strength‚ÄîI wish I‚Äôd had more time to see you grow, to be there for you. You are my heart, my sunshine, and please, always remember that. There‚Äôs so much I want to say, but time has grown scarce; I can feel it slipping away. My health is failing quickly, and it‚Äôs not by accident.

You deserve to know, Drea, that the reason for my failing health is Vivian‚Äîyour mother. I wanted so badly for our marriage to work, wanted to share everything with her. But she only cared about my fortune, and she‚Äôs gone to great lengths to secure it for herself.

My estate belongs solely to you and Adrian. I wanted to make this clear in a will, but I never expected time to run out this way. I‚Äôve long suspected Vivian was tainting my drinks, but today, I‚Äôm certain. She brought me coffee not long ago, and there, faintly on the cup‚Äôs rim, were traces of a familiar poison. I could call the police or rush to the hospital, but instead, I choose to write to you now, hoping you find this someday, hidden here in your nursery.

If things go as I hope, David may look after you, maybe even adopt you, though he doesn‚Äôt know of you yet. If not, I pray Adrian finds you and keeps you safe. I believe you‚Äôll grow into a remarkable woman, strong and resilient, Drea. Know that I loved you fiercely. Please tell Adrian that despite his anger over my choices, I‚Äôm deeply sorry and that I love him as well.

I love you both,

\~Emerson Grant""

The letter slipped from Drea‚Äôs trembling fingers, her legs giving way. Sorin quickly wrapped an arm around her shoulders, holding her upright as she crumpled into his side.

Tears blurred her vision, and through them, she looked up at Sorin, whose expression held a quiet grief. Though he was only a child back then, his affection for his uncle had been real.

She managed to choke out, ‚ÄúW-what does this mean?‚Äù

""Shh,"" Sorin soothed her, bending to pick up the letter and carefully slipping it into her book. ‚ÄúNot here, not now. Let‚Äôs get home, then we can talk.‚Äù

She nodded, her lips trembling as tears spilled over. Sorin gently wiped them away, wrapped an arm around her waist, and guided her out of the room. They descended the stairs quietly, moving toward the exit.

Just as they reached the door, her mother‚Äôs shrill voice called after them, ‚ÄúLeaving already? You haven‚Äôt stayed for lunch.‚Äù

Sorin‚Äôs jaw clenched tightly. Murderous woman, he thought, before turning to face her with a forced smile. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather have lunch alone with my wife. Thanks.‚Äù With that, he steered Drea out the door.

Once they were safely away, he pulled the car to a stop by the side of the road, dropping his head against the steering wheel. ‚ÄúDamn it, damn it, damn it.‚Äù

A soft touch settled over his hand, gripping the wheel tightly. Lifting his head, he found Drea‚Äôs gaze, shimmering with unshed tears as she tried to hold them back.

‚ÄúD-do you‚Ä¶ think this could really be true?‚Äù Her voice trembled with uncertainty.

He reached for the book and retrieved the letter, directing her gaze to its signature. ‚ÄúLook, he signed it. If we can track down some old documents he might‚Äôve signed, we‚Äôll have proof.‚Äù He paused, deep in thought. ‚ÄúDad must have something lying around.‚Äù A loud groan escaped him as he pinched the bridge of his nose, tears gathering in his eyes. ‚ÄúWhy did my uncle have to be so reckless? He could‚Äôve at least confided in my father and asked for his help! Damn it!‚Äù

Drea intertwined her fingers with his, offering a comforting squeeze. ‚ÄúWe‚Ä¶ we don‚Äôt really know what was going on back then‚Ä¶‚Äù

A sob erupted from him. ‚ÄúI loved him so much, Drea. I don‚Äôt remember everything, but I know I did. To learn he met such a tragic end‚Ä¶‚Äù

Leaning forward, Drea rested her forehead against his bicep, weeping alongside him. He lowered his chin onto her head, tears streaming down his cheeks as they sought solace in one another‚Äôs embrace.

After several moments, he wiped his eyes and said, ‚ÄúCall Adrian. Tell him to meet us at home.‚Äù

Drea nodded as Sorin drove away. When they arrived, Adrian sat at the dining table, his head bowed and hands gripping his hair in despair, the letter sprawled before him.

Taking a seat beside him, Drea wrapped her arm around him, offering comfort while Sorin stood back, his mind racing as he contemplated their next steps. Grief could wait; justice for his uncle was their immediate priority, and Sorin vowed he wouldn‚Äôt rest until it was served.

Suddenly, Adrian shot up from his seat, his eyes bloodshot and wild. He pulled out his pistol from the holster at his waist, making Drea gasp softly in shock.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it! That woman is going to pay today. I‚Äôve tolerated her long enough!‚Äù He growled, striding toward the door. Drea grasped his wrist, desperately trying to halt him.

‚ÄúAdrian, no!‚Äù

I'm sleeping well‚Äîgetting a solid 8-9 hours a night‚Äîbut I still feel sluggish and tired throughout the day.

I‚Äôve been working out daily, which I thought would help, and I work more than 8 hours a day, but man, the days just feel *long* and *exhausting.* Coffee in the morning and tea in the afternoon are my lifelines right now‚Äîwithout caffeine, I‚Äôd be completely lost!

Some quick context:

* My **stomach issues resolved around Day 5**, but I‚Äôm suddenly craving desserts like crazy, which is super weird because I‚Äôve never had much of a sweet tooth before.
* I wasn‚Äôt a daily drinker but was a **binge drinker for 10+ years**. I‚Äôd drink Thursday through Monday, averaging at least 5 glasses of wine a day.
* I thought working out would protect me from any harm alcohol was causing, but eventually, I started noticing stomach issues, headaches, and this constant discomfort in my body.
* My family drinks a lot, particularly my dad, and alcohol changes the way he behaves drastically

Funny enough, during my drinking days, I actually *felt* more energized, even though I know it was probably fake energy. I‚Äôve stopped drinking because I want to clear my mind, protect my brain, and regain the mental sharpness I used to have (I am a computer scientist/coder)

I know everyone‚Äôs path is different, but I‚Äôd love to hear:

* **What helped you overcome the tiredness?**
* **When did your energy start to bounce back?**
* Have you tried anything besides caffeine to help (nothing drug-related)?

Thank you in advance for any advice regarding my situation.

I‚Äôll try to be short and concise.

- Loss of income near $70,000 ( due to spouse, medical reasons)
- I didn‚Äôt make changes due to this loss and got into cc debt. 

I think I‚Äôm up to $50,000 in cc debt, and now the situation is worse even though I‚Äôm making more money. 

I made 150k last year, caveat is I made 70k in commission that is taxed at 38%. I also have about $600 taken weekly for benefits and taxes. I think after taxes I brought an average of $8000 per month, but it could be as low as 6k or 7k due to commission; 

Mortgage: 1800 per month, 2.5% , equity about 80k.
Car paymenys: 1. $680 ( no equity or negative equity) 2. $230( daughters car, she paid half as a down payment)
Car insurance: $230 per month
Utilities: total $800
Groceries: low $300 to high: $600 per week.
Misc: ( gas, coffee) $200
Eating out: 200

 
I‚Äôm assuming my cc payments must be about $2000 per month.I am running out of money every week, and I‚Äôm overwhelmed and thinking the only option to stop this vicious cycle is to file for bankruptcy.

Please let me know you need more info

I have been friends with my gay guy best friend for over 7 years now. My boyfriend and I have been dating for almost 3 and a half years.
Anytime I hangout with my girl friend he has no issue and welcomes it as I don't see her often.
Whenever I've hung out with my gay guy best friend he'll welcome it but then tell me things like l'm prioritizing him. On Friday I told him I was going to go get coffee with him and then he's like what're you guys going to do after and I said hangout at his cottage. He immediately took that as me hiding information from him and him having to pry information out of me.

He said he wasn't comfortable with me going to his cottage simply because he's a guy. I told him I didn't agree with him and he made me so upset about the situation I said now I don't know if I want to hangout with anyone tomorrow. I talked with multiple people and they said that he's not to tell me who I can and can't hangout with and where. My boyfriend and I kind of ended the phone call on not the greatest terms. 

The next day I went over to my gay friends like planned. My boyfriend came over later that day and when he found out I went to his cottage he pretty much lost it. And when he gets like this his whole personality changes and I actually feel scared in the moment. He was saying things like wow you clearly don't care about my opinion and I honestly started blacking out mentally because he was attacking my character at this point and making me feel like I was cheating on him with my gay friend. He took the pillowcase of his pillow, took his things out of my dresser gave me my key and slammed the door as he left. I had to tell him to go because he was attacking me in this moment with his words. 

It's hard for me because I think of all the good times we shared together and all the good qualities he possessed. He was almost always kind, loving and was truly my rock and person. I'm already grieving the memories we shared that were so happy and filled with love. But I also can't ignore the things that I feel were so different on. I hate how his whole personality changes when he gets mad in those few instances and it scares me. I didn't like that I felt he didn't accept and care about minorities the way I did as he told me in August he'd vote for Trump but then took it back. I didn't like that he made me feel like l was hiding things from him with my gay friend. On top of all this I feel like I truly lost my sex drive in our relationship. It was a constant stressor for me feeling like I wasn't meeting his needs in the relationship. I'm not asexual I'm very much into guys and have no idea the exact reason I lost my sex drive. It also hasn't helped that we live over an hour a part from eachother and really on got to see each other on the weekends. And I am constantly second guessing myself and wondering if I'm in the wrong.

His text: I'm sorry. I came up in the
hopes you'd be willing to talk with me. Because there was some things that I still wanted to tell you.
If you never want to talk to me again, I understand that too.
Ijust want you to know that I still love you and no matter what think you're the most amazing woman ive ever met. I've been a mess the past couple days, and just wanted to get some things off of my chest and maybe even see if you'd be willing to try and work through some of our differences. I wasn't coming up here in the hopes to get back together with you right now. I just wanted to talk things out and then see what happens. Obviously if you don't want to do that and are just done, I get that. ",0,1736808807.0,AITAH,10,0.5,False

It led me to a woman named¬†Cyndi Duran.
Ôøº
¬†I did a little vague digging¬†(because i'm currently¬†at work) and came across this interesting¬†site (https://cyzl.app/who-we-are/) she is the CEO/FOUNDER of. Being that she has ties to the sketchy pizza place, I proceeded to google ""Cydni Duran, Drake) and of course nothing quite alarming appeared¬†until I went to images and stumbled upon this image¬†(https://www.google.com/imgres?q=Cyndi%20Duran%20drake&imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fthejasminebrand.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2021%2F05%2FUntitled-design-32.png&imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fthejasminebrand.com%2F2021%2F05%2F26%2Fdrake-sparks-relationship-rumors-with-canadian-coffee-shop-owner-stylist-luisa-duran%2F&docid=UOShSy19aIG1UM&tbnid=eW8BERFuo8PL0M&vet=12ahUKEwjNm8Ptz_OKAxVbFFkFHXTwA1QQM3oECGQQAA..i&w=1080&h=1080&hcb=2&ved=2ahUKEwjNm8Ptz_OKAxVbFFkFHXTwA1QQM3oECGQQAA) of a woman named Luisa Duran with Drake. It may not seem like anything at first glance but as my superstitions grew I wondered why that image appeared and so¬†coincidentally Cydni Duran and Drake's Stylist/Owner of a Canadian coffee shop Luisa, have the same last name and favor each other heavily. (Also to add, the stylist was working with Drake¬†previously for¬†10 years prior to that picture being posted and article being written)(https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-9620181/Drake-gets-close-coffee-shop-owner-Luisa-Duran-says-hes-like-brother-Instagram.html). Did a little more google image searching, ""Cyndi Duran, Luisa Duran"" (https://www.google.com/search?q=Cyndi+Duran+luisa+duran&sca_esv=8214f2fdfa3e48e1&rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS978US978&udm=2&biw=1920&bih=919&ei=R4eFZ733Faeu5NoP8tWNkQ0&ved=0ahUKEwj9tsLb0_OKAxUnF1kFHfJqI9IQ4dUDCBE&uact=5&oq=Cyndi+Duran+luisa+duran&gs_lp=EgNpbWciF0N5bmRpIER1cmFuIGx1aXNhIGR1cmFuSN5AUIYLWMEncAF4AJABAJgBMKABowOqAQIxMbgBA8gBAPgBAZgCAaACJMICBhAAGAgYHpgDAIgGAZIHATGgB7AE&sclient=img) and the same picture of Drake and his stylist appeared, so I went ahead and clicked that link and this is what led me to this article published today (https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.waterdagen.be%2Fsource%2Fdrake-daughter&psig=AOvVaw3vBnByjs71_vdTRYGSdimN&ust=1736890585642000&source=images&cd=vfe&opi=89978449&ved=0CBcQjhxqFwoTCJjRhKTU84oDFQAAAAAdAAAAABAc)...(I know its a very vague website but taking to account that it was published TODAY...worth looking into)

I may have found smoke, it may be nothing. This sub has led me there and to many strange connections before and this is another time it has done this.¬†

This is a think piece but please pick up from where I left off.

Pros: The resort is beautiful. The room is fantastic - spacious, nicely decorated, fridge fully stocked daily, excellent coffee/tea station with a full sized drip coffee maker and a kettle. 
The main pool with the swim up bar is nice. The pool temperature is refreshing but not cold. Bar service at the swim up pool is good.
The food here has been fantastic so far. We‚Äôve enjoyed every meal we‚Äôve had. 

Cons: The pool connected to our room is unusable because it‚Äôs freezing cold - ice cube cold. 
Service at restaurants is extremely slow and sometimes non-existent. We waited 45 minutes after being seated at Gatsu Gatsu to get drinks and food after our orders were taken. We waited 40 minutes at lunch for food at Parisol after our orders were taken and at least 5 tables seated after us received their food. One table next to us was on round 2 of food after arriving 10 minutes after us. We ordered several of the same items they were served. We got up and left and ordered pizza instead. 

Be prepared to wait for food at any sit down restaurant. ",5,1736808615.0,SandalsResorts,3,1.0,False

However,  I know there is a Quiznos within 2 miles of the customers location.  So I denied order.  Second offer was an order for 16 miles for a Starbucks coffee.  No thank you cause Starbucks also located close to that drop off.  Now I got kicked from dash by the hour for the day.  This seems to be happening every dang day now and this was never the case before.  I know there‚Äôs stores waayyy closer to the customers locations every time.  So why is door dash doing that?  I have a theory that they want you to stay broke so you have to keep on working.  Keep in mind I am a platinum dasher and have priority access to top paying orders.  It‚Äôs highly frustrating because I know nobody takes long orders cause usually it‚Äôs a no tip.  I don‚Äôt know if their algorithm just sucks or what is going on?  Why are all the shit orders getting put on me?  Any thoughts or suggestions?",2,1736808582.0,doordash,9,1.0,False

Also, high praise for Manchester Coffee Co. 

I got two different coffees as pourovers from them. After I told the guy one of them was a little bitter, he said ‚Äúyeah, I tried it before serving it to you and I agree. We are actually still trying to figure that coffee out‚Äù and then changed the grind and made a much better cup for me. 

All this might sound silly and over the top to non-coffee nerds, but you aren‚Äôt going to find an experience like that unless you go somewhere like ‚ÄúNow and Then‚Äù in Nashville and pay $20+ for a cup.

I have a lot of questions but I'll try to keep it concise so here it goes
-Like what are you supposed to when you first meet up? A hug definitely is too personal but a firm handshake seems too business-y. Would just a hello be enough?
-He's aware that I'm Autistic but should I give him a heads up text before meeting that lays out the basics of people with ASD ( mainly the no/low eye contact and excessive sweating thing) or would that be TMI and a total turn off?
-What do I do in the off chance he initiates physical contact? Do I just brace for impact or tell him verbally I'm not super comfortable with that till I know him better? I'm not opposed to it but I am super nervous of it happening 
-This is a less Autistim question but I realized the latest pic on my Tinder profile is 2 years old and I have this semi-irrational fear that when he finally meet up he'll think I'm catfishing him due to putting on a bit of weight and some hair thinning issues I've had recently. The best idea I can come up with is to take the most flattering current day pic I can then send it to him before the date with a message that says ""This is what you're working with so no biggies if you don't want to drive 50 minutes up to see me now"". Is that a reasonable solution or is that insane person behavior that'd drive him off?

Any and all advice would be appreciated!

TL;DR Autistic gay guy is currently freaking out more than he should over a coffee date

Long time lurker, first time poster. Thanks to everyone who has provided feedback and info on this page because it‚Äôs helped me massively throughout learning to make espresso. 

Super pumped to have recently received my Profitec Go (upgraded from BBE) and overall really enjoying it. 

I bought the ECM bottomless portafilter and IMS filter basket and generally have no problems, still fine-tuning my shots but things have been pretty good. 

One weird thing has come up that I wanted to ask the hive mind about - I have found that I have to really crank the ECM portafilter into the group head. So much so that I‚Äôm pinching my hand to do it. If I don‚Äôt really crank it as far as possible I get water leaking from between the group and portafilter (no coffee sputter from the portafilter itself). This doesn‚Äôt happen with the OEM portafilter, with or without the IMS basket. I‚Äôm worried that it‚Äôs bad for the machine, what do y‚Äôall think? Am I just a tiny weak baby for having to wrench the portafilter into the machine?
