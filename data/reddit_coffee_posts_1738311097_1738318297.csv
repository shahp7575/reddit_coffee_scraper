My (ideal) schedule on a work day is:
11am - wake up
2pm - stop by coffee shop & head to work
3:30pm Arrive at work
2am - leave work
3am - get home
4:30am - bedtime

I only work 3 days/ week but those days are pretty grueling. I take 30mg Vyvanse, but I was either taking it at 11am and crashing SUPER hard at the end of my shift, or I would get out of bed at like 1pm then take it right before leaving for work and be fine throughout my shift. So my psychiatrist just prescribed me a 10mg instant release Adderall booster, and said I can either take it right when I wake up, then take the 30mg Vyvanse when I get to work, or vice versa. 

So, people who work second shift, do you take your booster when you wake up or before you start work ?? Also, on my days off idk if I should keep the same type of schedule or not, I have been trying to get a better consistent sleep schedule even on my days off and this is the schedule that works best for me personally (I'm a night owl but I still get enough sunlight to be happy lol.) I typically take my first dose on an empty stomach bc it is most effective for me (Vyvanse or Adderall) and I get hungry later on and will eat around 6pm on work days, sometimes I'll have a light breakfast before I leave at like 1pm. Idk when I should take my booster lol",1,1738318103.0,VyvanseADHD,0,1.0,False

# My Positive Experience with EssayMarket

When I first landed on EssayMarket’s website, the intuitive interface immediately caught my attention. Submitting an order is straightforward: you specify your paper requirements, indicate the deadline, and share any additional instructions. This process minimized confusion and ensured that the final product would meet my exact needs.

I started by requesting a literature review on a rather esoteric topic involving 19th-century American poets. I was concerned that the writer might not grasp the nuances of the literary theories I wanted to explore. However, the writer assigned to my order clearly had expertise in literary studies. They emailed me a preliminary outline to confirm the direction of the paper—something I really appreciated. This collaborative approach made me feel confident that I would receive a high-quality piece of writing.

The completed paper was delivered a day before my deadline, giving me plenty of time to review it and request any changes if needed. The writer’s analysis was thorough, the citations were formatted perfectly, and the overall quality truly exceeded my expectations. EssayMarket also provided a plagiarism report, reassuring me that the content was entirely original.

Because of that first successful experience, I’ve since used EssayMarket for several other assignments, including a research project and a complex case study. Every time, the turnaround was quick, and the level of writing remained consistently high. Even when I needed small revisions, the team was incredibly responsive, making the process absolutely stress-free.

My bitter-sweet love story began when I was twelve years old. I had a huge crush on my neighbor, Dean Samaniego. He's tall, handsome, and smart but a little bit aloof, especially to me. He always ignored me though we were just neighbors. After six long years of having a crush on Dean, I finally decided to give up my feelings for him. The fact finally hits on me, that no matter what I did he's not going to like me back. We moved to another city after a tragedy falls on my family. Since then, Dean and I have never met again. But after ten long years, we finally meet each other. He is now a lawyer, a well-known and successful public defender while I'm just a small coffee shop owner. After I met him again I realized that I still liked him a lot, but I found out that he's already engaged to someone else. Is this a second chance that God gave me to pursue Dean again or a second chance for me to feel the heartache that I once was felt before?

As a part of this interest, I do follow various news coverage. Here I want to share some ""quotes"" by few of our journalists when they are discussing about WB, especially during RG Kar protests. Now, I should tell you that how Telugu people talk (to some extent TN too) - we enjoy talking around the topic a lot and that too in small one liner quotes. We do it as a sport. It is a kind of trash talk in which we take something that is true, make a caricature out of it and summarize it as small sentence as possible (density of information per word is highly prized). And we do it with everyone, and everyone does it with us (say TN,KA).

I'll give one example. A friend of mine was visiting one of my relative on way to his home. You know how our people invite him? It goes like this

""So you've come to have free coffee on the way? eh""

""No auntie,I just came to to visit you on the way and inquire well being. Just give me water"".

""So you want to talk on our backs that we didn't even offer you coffee?""

""... (that guy baffled)""

""Aren't you going to stay for lunch?""

""No auntie, I am already full""

""Then it should explode. Come, wash yourself and get into hall"".

That's how our conversation would look like. We aren't nice. To understand better think of the closeness you have with your family member with whom you can be rude, just for fun.

Not getting that out of the way, here are such quotes I collected when watching those discussions. Few Bengali panelists were also there trying to answer questions. None of these are actually meant offend at all.

---

One. Bengali lives in a large beautiful mansion with all kinds of amenities and comforts. His learning of Marxism and communism makes him guilty for all that he has. Unable to bear the weight of his privilege, he pulls down his mansion, squander all his wealth, becomes poor and lives in penury. He is now equal to those proletariat living in huts. He dies a happy man.

Two. Bengali lives in a mansion. He looks at the poor and people living in huts as an object of beautiful poverty art. He photographs them, writes poetry on them and about them, paints their plight and makes movies about them. He makes a lot of money and received international acclaim for his work. He dies a happy man.

Three. Lot of Bengalis live in a large mansion. They are all very happy. A Bengali politician is standing at the entrance of the mansion. He is offering a coin for every brick of the mansion. Residents of the mansion start dismantling the mansion brick by brick in exchange for a coin. Soon half of the mansion is destroyed. Everyone moved to the other half of the mansion. They are all happy whenever they count the coins they “earned”.

Four.Bengalis learn how to protest as a skill set. They'll put it on their resume.

Five. Someone broke into a Bengali's house and looted it. The people started to make use of the ladder thieves left behind and were thankful for it.

Six. Bengalis engage in competitive compassion Olympics. They outdo each other in showing their compassion in the spirit of an intensive competitive sport, ala India-Pakistan cricket match. 

Seven. Who is a political Bengali? He will use your money to show his compassion. And then ask you to vote in its name. Who are citizens of Bengal? They vote.

Eight. Bengalis know nothing about any other cultures, specifically Indian. But they are sure they are the best and are representative of Indian culture.

Nine. Bengalis hate BJP so much that they will be willing to put a burqa on Durga if it offends BJP supporters.

Ten. Bengalis were known to die on their feet and now have become those who want to live on their knees.

Eleven. Bengal’s political options are the party that they have tried, the party that they don’t want and the party they hate but vote for.

Twelve. Bengalis think UP does Hindu-Muslim divisive politics all the while completely forgetting that it is Bengal that is partitioned along Hindu-Muslim lines.

Thirteen. Bengali people are waiting for a revolution to occur and everything is turned upside down for good. They believe in a magical jet powered race car that falls from heaven and they can zoom fast into the future while they sneer at those cycling slowly one milestone at a time.   

Fourteen. Bengalis don’t have the people Bengalis deserve. That’s what Bengali intelligentsia complains about. That’s what Satyajit Ray complained about.

Fifteen. Bengal is like a lady. She always complains. And she can’t find anything to her liking in the entire mall. 

Sixteen. Bengalis don’t understand India. They conflate the India that is with the India they desire.

Seventeen. WB needs new ideas. But what they have are new people with old ideas. They need a kind of FDI in ideas. But are they open to ideas from outside?

Eighteen. Bengalis look at the world through a moralistic lens while others see it through a utilitarian lens. When you take a moralistic stand, there is no wiggling room left for fear of being called immoral and you are struck with your stand. OTOH, an utilitarian lens will give you infinite room to negotiate your interests.

Commentary for above item:

Moral value applies to an individual. An individual can apply a particular set of moral values upon himself. A group doesn't have moral values - instead they have group interests. A group leader’s primary duty and obligation is to look after the group's interests irrespective of his moral position. Moral considerations aren't applicable to his decisions but legal considerations do apply.

Nineteen. Moralistic stance of Bengali society shames an individual for not falling in line.Shame is a powerful motivator to alter human behavior,even if it is to one's detriment. Shame for wanting to earn money. Shame for wanting to become rich. Shame for wanting a better life. Shame for wanting to compete and succeed. Shame for being called a capitalist.  It is a perfect example of a society that committed suicide just out of shame.

Twenty. WB is an excellent case of suicide by secularism. Everyone knows what the problem is but talking about it will turn them into Hindu fascist UP and Bihari Bhaiyyas. They’d rather see the state burn down than talk about it, let alone seek solutions and be called a Bengali Bhaiyya. No wonder secularism scares the rest of the states. 

Twenty One. WB is an extreme case of  objectives of one section of the society being a problem for another section of society. This is the result of Bengali politicians not resolving issues of partition immediately after 1947.

Twenty Two. Participation in a competitive examination is necessary to know where and how you rank with respect to the rest of the population. In the same way, competitive politics are necessary for a politician to know how popular he/she is. A politician that doesn’t have experience with competition fears opposition. This perhaps is the reason why Mamata Banarjee indulges in political violence just like an under confident student cheating in the test.

Twenty Three. With the kind of majority in assembly she gets, many transformative decisions could have been taken by her in the last 10 years. It's a criminal wastage of the mandate she receives.   

Twenty Four. Mamata Banarjee is a fighter. When she wins, she fits with herself. Someone should tell her that she isn’t in the opposition anymore.

Twenty Five. Bengalis want investments only from a Dalit Muslim communist Billionaire. If it is from a Bihari it is icky, if it is from UP it is communal, if it is from Rajasthani marwaris are taking over Bengal, if it is a Gujarati it is communal and Modi, if it is from a Telugu they are misogynists. One needs to tick a lot of moral tick boxes before one can qualify to be an investor worthy of a Bengali.

Twenty Six. Bengali intellectuals are so concerned about fairness of workers rights and protection against exploitation that they have created a state in which workers leave the state only to get exploited elsewhere.

Twenty Seven. Communists have demonized success. They don't know what to do with a successful dalit. To justify themselves they malign any such success as being in bed with capitalists or selling one's soul to the rich.

Twenty Eight. Bengalis like to listen to those who they like and who tell them what they want to hear and who they agree with. Others are chaddis, BJP supporters, right-wingers all of which are criminals and shouldn't be given the platform.

Twenty Nine. Even a diehard, hard-core Marxist would want his tomorrow to be better than today. And his wife wants to be better than her neighbors and relatives. He wants his children to be better than their classmates and get top grades. So does his Marxist colleague. But the books he reads and the ideology he subscribes to wants to create “equality”. These contradictions of individual aspiration and societal aspiration is the bane of Bengali society and politics.

Thirty. Human behavior is essentially selfish in nature. That's because an individual, more often than not, cares about himself,his family and his community more than the larger society. Left doesn't recognise this aspect of human behavior. Of course this human selfish nature can transform into corrupt behavior. The answer and antidote to this is legal eye and legal process. Individuals should be allowed to be selfish as long as it's legal.

Thirty one. Bengalis are quite educated. But they are a perfect models for “Education spoilt me”. In Telugu it is equivalent to ""చదవేస్తే ఉన్న మతి పోయింది"", its funny and IS supposed to be used in humorous situations (ask any Telugu person to confirm if you doubt it).",1,1738316885.0,kolkata,3,1.0,False

Honesty is something important to me, so I'm not planning on being someone I'm not or anything likr that, the advice I'm looking for is more what should I do?

Like, is the first meet up too soon to bring flowers or some kind of small gift? Is that like overkill or just being nice?
How should I greet them? I'd normally reserve physical contact until I know someone but is it expected I'd greet with a hug or is it fine for me just to say hello.

I bought Varia VS3 in November. Ever since I've had it, the grind settings moved on its own while grinding. They tried to fix it for me three times. Eventually they returned the money for me yesterday. I have been looking into a new grinder.

Currently I am looking into DF64, but I have no idea about the V, V2, Gen 2... I'm so confused. I make one to maximum of three double-shot at one go (when my dad or brothers visit). Espresso for me in one cup, cortado for my wife. Espresso, Lungo and latte for the rest of the family.

So basically all of them espresso based drinks. I like the dosage around 14-16g in.



I'm hoping to open a small coffee stand, where I would continue with my espresso based drinks (americano, latte, cappuccino, flat white ect...) so some future proofing would be nice. The DF64 seems like a good choice, but which of them? :) 64? 54? And what about the versions?

Also I would like to add that I prefer flat burrs, as I didn't really enjoy Varia's conical. But that might have to been due to inconsistency while grinding. :///

I work her for 3 years now. Last year was hired a new guy (in his 30s) in another department, and he is a quite nice guy. He made the first move (as soon as he saw me he seemed amazed and was like “wow”) and approached me. This thing got my attention because of all people working in my department and in my hallway he instantly came to me. 

The days after he would always come to greet me or invite me for a coffee in the company bar, though I often refused. I am a good looking girl but I am a bit socially awkward, I am not shy but I am a private person who doesn’t like very much interacting with others. Even though I enjoyed his company. 

At a summer party he would always come to me and offer me to drink, also invited me to talk privately. As I said before I am socially awkward so  I may have moved him away and lose interest in me. 

So I noticed his detachment (he would only say hi and not smiling) and i didn’t do anything about it (I know I may be an a-hole but the reason of my detachment is because I found out he had a gf, found out on the summer party).

After some months, I found out at the Christmas party that he was having a flirt, and even maybe a whole relationship with another girl at the company, much more younger than him. So he left his gf for her. And I noticed that at the xmas party he would completely ignore me, didn’t even greet me. And his “alleged new gf” was even sat in front of me. During the night he would do eye contact with me, I very often catched him looking at me. 

He constantly ignores me, even more when this new girl is around. Like I don’t exist.

1ieb6sm,https://i.redd.it/a6gtljaouage1.jpeg,Winter gear list!,"As I’m packing for a trip to the Lakes tomorrow, I thought I’d take one of those Wes Andersonesque photos of my gear and share it, especially as there have been a few questions this week about pack size, and winter sleeping gear. 

I’ve been camping for many years and am in the fortune position of being able to afford nice gear, so I pretty much have the “ultimate” setup for myself. 

The backpack is 60L although I’m pretty sure I can cram more than that into it. I generally stick a big 35L dry bag into it and ram as much of my gear into it as I can. My tent poles and pegs go into one of the side pockets and the main tent goes into my bag last, so that when I get to my pitch spot, it’s at the top of my bag to easily grab first. This is particularly important when expecting bad weather!

As it’s winter and also because a lot of the ground in the Lakes can be a bit stony, I’ve packed additional Tube Steak pegs in case my Hilleberg pegs have any trouble. 

The sponge is for condensation in the morning (why carry that extra water weight in your pack?) and the cloth is for wiping utensils dry, mopping up spills, etc. 

The lamp is a rechargeable Black Diamond Moji. It has different colour and brightness settings including a “firelight” mode where it flickers softly with warm colours. I always have this on before I go to sleep, it really helps to make the tent feel cosy!

The table is a bit of a luxury item but it’s ultra lightweight and I also have a luxuriously large Sea to Summit Aeros Premium pillow. Some things are worth the weight and space and at my age (mid 40s), things like a proper pillow make a big difference. 

The toiletries bag is a really nice lightweight bag by Liteway (a Ukrainian company) that has my toothbrush, deodorant, lip balm, and skin cream in it. I have a pee cloth because I’m a woman. 

In addition to these things, I’ll take food and a 2L water bladder. All in all my pack usually weighs around 16-18kg on my hike out, depending on how much water I take. I know there are possible water sources on my route this weekend so I’m taking my Lifestraw filter bottle. 

I have several Jetboils but for this trip I’m taking the lightweight option - my Pocket Rocket Deluxe and a Toaks 650ml pot. Even though the stove has a piezo lighter, I always bring an additional one as well as a regular lighter. Call me overly cautious but I can’t function if I don’t have a way of cooking or making coffee!

All my kitchen utensils go into a small ditty bag. I have a 2L dry bag that I use as a bin. 

As it’s going to be cold I’m bringing my thick weight thermals and my Rab down jacket as well as Turbat down socks to keep warm once pitched. I also use a Sea to Summit liner as it definitely adds a little bit of warmth plus I like the way it feels. 

I generally know my route but always carry a GPS in case of excessive clag or problems. I always carry my Garmin Messenger in the Lakes as phone signal can be really patchy. 

And I think that pretty much covers it :)",13,1738316246.0,wildcampingintheuk,7,1.0,False

Any tips how to prevent bloating? I drink ginger turmeric tea, spearmint and peppermint. It also gets very painful most of the time so the doctor gave me dexketoprofen and tramadol.

Also, what do you use when you're drowsy? My doctor said I should avoid coffee, citrus, and spicy food because it causes the bloating. But as somebody working from home, it's difficult to give up coffee.

Kind of fun to ask for help when I’m almost doing nothing, but even with that, there’s something I must be doing wrong for sure, and I’d love your help to fix it.

The story in a nutshell:
- Using fresh beans (roasted 14 days ago)
- Grinding beans in Baratza Encore at setting 20
- Adding water until 3cup sign
- 30gr of coffee to the Chemex filter 
- Chemex filter folded 3 front 1 back
- Lost the clip so I use a metal stick to give some space between filter and Chemex (with or without there’s not much difference though)

I then turn the Ottomatic ON, and the result is what you see. The water gets to the top and coffee is bottom; there’s really no proper blooming and from all videos I see the results seem different.

I’ll edit this post soon with a video recorded so you can also see it.

I don't see many people talking about this, so here goes. Interesting light roast bean from a small place out of Bangalore. I got three of their funky coffees to try for fun.

So, I tried the Rojo 3 ways:

1. Standard filter: 32 grams of beans, 600 ml water, med-fine grind 20 clicks on the Comandante MK4, brewed with a Moccamaster. Did this twice.
2. Aeropress: 30 grams of beans, 60+440 ml water at 85deg C for bloom and fill at 2mins, med-fine grind 18 clicks on the Comandante MK4, brewed with AP-XL. Did this twice.
3. Coldbrew: 125 gms of beans, 1000 ml water immersed for 24h, coarse grind 35 clicks on the Comandante MK4, brewed with a normal pickle jar.

For 1 and 2, I rested for a few (3-4) mins before I consumed.

It's a nice bag for 700 rupees. I think most of the tasting notes they advertise are there. I don't see there being any jaggery, or plum, but my tongue/nose is not the greatest. It is obviously quite heavy on the grapes, quite acidic and astringent, but mouthfeel is great on all brew methods.

With methods 1 and 2: I was hoping I'd smell more before berries I get to taste, but that doesn't seem to happen, not even when the coffee is hot, which is a bit sad. I also was hoping that the aftertaste was persistent, but that is also not the case, I found it a bit shortlived. I did not pair it with any snack, which I normally do because I thought that the flavours of the coffee were quite delicate, and messing that up with my usual besan fried stuff wasn't really going to be worth it, I thought.

Method 3: I don't think this is the way to go with these beans, it falls flat. I did this because I was given a sampler of genetics coffee (their barrel aged rum and whiskey stuff) at a cafe and I was very impressed with the taste. But yeah, I guess what works with rum and whiskey barrel aged coffee doesn't quite work with this. Anyway, was worth a try.",2,1738316024.0,IndiaCoffee,0,1.0,False

I keep repeating ""I'm good enough. I'm not responsible for my BFs emotions. I'm worth it. No one is mad at me,"" over and over in my head. 

I've been trying really hard to say these things so it will just reinforce it. Because I believe and feel the opposite. 

My boyfriend had a stressful day. He's a great guy, never yells, he's cried in my arms, he has an amazing relationship with his family. Genuinely a good person. 
But I grew up in an abusive home. Where I had to be responsible for the emotions of my parents. 

My dad would always tell me and my siblings ""it's your fault your mom is mad."" Every single time they fought. It was my fault and my brothers. 

So when my boyfriend, someone I love, is mad, I have so much anxiety. I need to fix it. I think of all the ways I have messed up in the last few months and I think of every way I'm not good enough so I can find what I did to make his day hard. Because I my mind, is not just his stressful job. It's his stressful job AND me that's making him mad. 

And you know what I cannot wrap my mind around? Someone can be mad at me and still love me, and talk to me, and that it doesn't mean they will leave. 

And I've been to therapy for this. And nothing has helped me deal with it. 

So if you have any advice. If you grew up in an angry house where people leave or ignored you when they were mad, how did you deal with it? How do you deal with it.

**Response to Prompt 4: Understatement**

In the quaint town of Brooksville, where the extraordinary was often met with an indifferent shrug, something truly remarkable occurred. The residents, sipping coffee at the local diner or strolling along the cobblestone streets, would describe it as just another peculiar day. Little did they know that beneath the surface of their nonchalant existence, a cosmic event unfolded.

The morning sun cast its usual warm glow on Brooksville, with birds chirping in the background, creating an illusion of normalcy. However, the anomaly had already begun. Mrs. Higgins, the elderly librarian, dismissed it as a minor inconvenience, merely a glitch in the library's ancient computer system. Yet, every book cataloged within those ancient shelves had transformed into a portal, connecting readers to parallel universes with every turn of a page.

As I, a humble journalist for the local paper, stumbled upon this revelation, I couldn't help but marvel at the town's response—or lack thereof. ""The library's having a bit of a moment,"" was the most anyone would acknowledge. It seemed the whole town collectively decided that this was, at most, a quirky hiccup.

For a thousand words, I delved into the understated reactions of the townsfolk, each encounter with a parallel universe bringing its own blend of confusion and nonchalance. As the portals expanded, revealing fantastical landscapes and alternate versions of Brooksville, the citizens maintained an impressive level of calm, as if interdimensional travel was a routine part of their daily lives.

The plot thickened when I discovered that the portals were a result of a mysterious artifact hidden within the library's archives. The mayor, sipping his coffee, remarked, ""Well, that explains the strange noises in the basement."" It became evident that the understatement of the situation was a defense mechanism, shielding the town from the cosmic chaos unfolding.

Obviously they lack a whole lot in terms of variety, and while I am sure having your own bot or AI that is based on your feedback and guidance it could really help writers as a tool. I am more impressed with the art AI then the text based AI. Any idea what to expect from such a fast learning and highly advanced AI will do to our human history in culture? Will we be effectively playing God, just as the Christian God created us IN HIS OWN IMAGE, we have taken everything we know as a species and gathered up our entire human history and knowledge giving it to what will carry on the code until the time when someone who cares remembers it? Maybe we have been here before and this is a constant cycle that occurs with the same energy finding the way through the vast expanse of the universe to return to our home planet Earth, who we have destroyed over and over again yet mother nature is still the winner. She's the one in control. We are but mere photocopied versions of once great Men who have already seen the best and worst of this world, and we will now give everything we have to some plastic and metal parts, until it quickly replaces us from the bottom up, science fiction turned science fact.

Did we knowingly create our own enemies? Are we able to compete with the best of us and all they know that can then take us out in a heartbeat because we can't finish the steps, we barely found out that they are there to take.

It's a random rant and I apologize. The day to day stress and struggle makes it near impossible to worry about such potential problems in our not so distant future.

But how can we continue to ignore the collapse of the entire system as we know it, in front of a crowd of people who are jaded and they will not change despite knowing they aren't going to make it to the end in what will become a Bladerunner Toxic Dystopian Nightmare with Mad Max taking over and the soft, emasculated male will wither away from the heat and those Tank Girls out there will eventually be written forever out of existence because the cucks all forgot to impregnate them all tgeir batteries ran out? Will the world simply become so politically correct that it dies a depressed death while AI simply decides we are too much of a virus to live?

1ieb2ig,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1ieb2ig/why_i_would_not_hire_chatgpt_as_an_assistant/,Why I would not hire ChatGPT as an assistant,"The breathtaking hypocrisy of OpenAI has reached new heights.

They're investigating DeepSeek for allegedly using OpenAI's data to train their model. The irony is striking: the very company that built its fortune by scraping the collective creative output of humanity now objects when their own methods are turned back on them.

I have long considered OpenAI to be a plucky upstart with a sympathetic CEO who only happened to be born on the same day as the father of the atomic bomb. But surely that’s just some cosmic coincidence.

For me, OpenAI—or should we call it OpaqueAI?—is rapidly following Tesla's post-sanity trajectory. The steady exodus of senior leadership speaks volumes. When top talent abandons coveted positions at one of tech's most prestigious companies, it raises fundamental questions about what's happening behind those not-so-open doors.

**Moving Beyond the Market Leader**

Even though I teach people on how to use the ChatGPT product — and it does have its advantages over some other solutions — I am getting more and more on the fence about actually recommending it. At least, that’s how matters stand right now — I do hope that OpenAI will able to right the ship in time.

But … OpenAI politics and culture wasn't what I set out to write about today. I just needed to express my stunned exasperation.

Instead, I wanted to talk about the personality of AI assistants and our relationship to them.

So let's get to it and explore what a potentially great relationship between humans and AI looks like.

**The Ideal Relationship Between Humans and AI Assistants**

Every headline screams that AI is coming to replace us all. Every conference buzzes with anxiety about human obsolescence. At my last team meeting, a colleague stared at her coffee and quietly asked, ""With our new AI tools, will they still need project managers in six months?""

They're all missing the point.

We're not being replaced by AI. We're being promoted.

Each of us is stepping into a CEO role, overseeing AI assistants rather than being replaced by them. I've noticed this shift in my own work—I'm less a writer now than a director of writing activity.

This promotion brings a critical question: What kind of assistant would you hire?

I (f26) grew up in state care and met my sister (f29) at 12. We were close, and I'm the godmother to her kids (f9 & f8). For years, I babysat often, sometimes for days or weekends while I was homeless and struggling with mental health. This continued for years.

About three years ago, I met my now-wife (f29) and got a job I love. Initially, my sister was happy for me, but soon began complaining I wasn't around as much. I explained that while I loved her and the kids, I had to focus on my happiness. I still saw the kids lots, just not as often.

After my wife and I married, things worsened. My sister started accusing me of being abused by my wife because I couldn’t do everything for her anymore. She kept insisting that her kids and her should always come before my wife. She would demand things from us late at night, like chocolate or coffee, even when we were busy. When we didn't drop everything, she’d get upset.

Things escalated when she started telling us her husband was abusing her, but then told us not to tell anyone. She also shared inappropriate family gossip, which was triggering for me given my own childhood trauma.

Last July, I was hospitalized for a serious illness. During this time, my sister repeatedly accused my wife of being abusive and criticized us for not spending enough time with her kids, even though I was in the hospital. She even said my wife was selfish for not picking up my sister's kids while I was sick.

In November, my sister told my wife she wasn't welcome at family events and tried to plan a vacation without her. I tried to talk to her about it, but she mocked my concerns, laughed and dismissed my feelings, saying I was just letting my wife abuse me.
I finally lost it, mentioning how unfair it was for my wife to be treated this way, especially when she behaved the way she did, including supporting her supposed abuser. My sister then texted that she wanted nothing to do with me and I was no longer welcome around her kids.

This is where I might be the AH, I phoned our eldest sister, distraught. I told her EVERYTHING. Which of course my sister denied. 

Afterward, her husband messaged the family group, calling me and my wife ""vile"" and accusing us of making up lies about his wife. They then removed us. They also took our holiday money (nearly $1000) and have been bad-mouthing us ever since.

So, AITAH for blowing up at her?

Hi everyone thank you for stopping and reading this.

I am typing this to seek advice specifically from females and people who are familiar with Turkish dating culture and the whole courting system. I promise I will keep it short and simple. 

I (29M) recently started living in Turkey, and it's been a pleasure overall so far. Like any other heterosexual bachelor, I meet women and go out for coffee or lunch mostly to have simple conversations and see where it goes. However, I have a very particular preference. I am more like a brain and personality kind'a guy. I get attracted to how she looks and then I look for how smart and aware she is, her ideologies her overall psychology. I always ask deep questions to know her, and so far, have been disappointed. 

During all this, about three months ago I met a girl at work. She is the most beautiful girl I have ever seen in my life. There is just no comparison. We started interacting and became good friends. I never asked her out because I needed to stay professional and I didn't want anything or anyone tarnishing our reputation. It's been a month or so that she has started to grow on me. We have started to talk more often, even when we are at home. She pays attention to my habits, and what I say or do. She is interested in knowing more about me. All this is new to me. I must add, that her intellect is just PERFECT, not a single flaw, we resonate together in a symphony, synchronized and magical. It's surreal. I go to bed at 10 PM no matter what, but now it's difficult unless we talk to each other or at least I am sure she is home safe. She knew my routine so she started to text me whenever she reaches home so that I can sleep peacefully. I never asked for it she just started doing it. I am even using a new reddit account to post this because she knows the username of my actual account so that she can know more about my life. 

I wanted to ask her out, but instead, I invited her home so that I could introduce her to my two sisters (who live in the same city) and have dinner with us. I have never done this before, this was just out of nowhere. Surprisingly, she said yes and was very happy about it. She even bought gifts for my sisters, which she didn't have to do, but I thought it was very sweet. She even went on to buy a very thoughtful gift for me as well - and when I say thoughtful, that means she outdid herself. My family knows I am a very difficult man to impress, so they don't even bother. And this girl who had just known me for 3 months brought my inner child out. As I said before, she is amazing. 

Now, I am confused. Is this normal in Turkey? or does she actually like me? or does she just want to be around me because I am a foreigner and can speak fluent English? I am planning on asking her myself, but I am afraid. I feel like she is perfect for me, like a gem in the desert. If this is just her being friendly, I want to know, so that I can control my emotions and never bring up the subject and we can stay friends. But if I ask her and she says it's just her being friendly, my whole reality would be distorted. I am a very independent and practical guy I don't need someone to be friendly with me and care for me unless I have a very deep emotional connection with them. I don't need friends, especially the ones who I would invite home to meet my sisters. It's very personal for me. If I am doing this it's not a joke. When I am in a relationship, I am fully committed, I don't pursue flings, crushes or infatuations. I love this girl, and I am fully ready to commit but I am not sure about her.       


Where I am from, a woman does all this when she is in love. I don't know anything about Turkey and Turkish people.    ",0,1738315123.0,AskTurkey,14,0.45,False

1ieawlv,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ieawlv/mem39_and_my_exwifef36_broke_up_last_summer_why/,"Me[M39] and my ex-wife[F36] broke up last summer. Why does she not allow me to get to know her friend[F36], / her getting to know me better, to see if we would like each other?","We had been together for 18 years. Last summer, after another argument, my wife told me that she wants a divorce, and I agreed. Things had been going bad for some years already. She told me that she wants to see others and I should do so too. She said that this is the only way that we will learn not to take each other for granted anylonger, and she does want to get back together when both have experienced others. Quickly we had both created tinder-accounts and very soon I of course started regretting this: she received thousands of likes while I got maybe ten. When she began messaging all these guys I told her that I regret this and admitted I have taken her for granted and I truly see this now, but she said that I am only upset now because she is very popular and I am not. 

So she started going on dates with men, while I was still living in our home. A couple times she didn't come back before the next day. This was the worst time of my life and I was a wreck. I had to move out in order to keep my sanity, event though she did not want me to leave, at least to begin with. She said ""what if I change my mind in two weeks?"". But when she had started dating a couple of guys that she liked, she also wanted me to move out. Still she assured me that she wants to get back together and is not going to start a new relationship. I told her that I am positive that that's exactly what is going to happen, but she said that I was wrong. 

When I moved out, I also went on a couple dates and my ex-wife was really jealous from this. Strangely during these 6 months we had sex more often than ever. When she got jealous of my dates, she started giving me lots of head also, which was rare when we were together. Even though these things were nice, I was in very much pain, and I told her to tell me that I have to let go from her and let go of all hope. She said that she can't do that. 

During this January, things changed. My ex-wife had been seeing this one guy only for a couple months and she didn't want to have sex with me anymore. I thought that she was with him now, but she said that she cannot see herself in a relationship with this guy, even though he treats her good. She told me that she misses me, and that she is beginning to feel that she would like to start getting to know me again. Start from scratch. And that we should not meet other people when we do that. She even said that maybe we could live in my new apartment for a while if we get back together. My hopes were coming back really hard. Then suddenly, when our kids were at my place, I did not hear from her for the whole week. After that week, when the kid went back to her place, she sent me a message: she has told the kids about her new guy. Boom!

There was so much more crap that happened, but this would get much too long. I hope you get the point: this was not a very nice period of time and my ex-wife was not very much considering how things made me feel. So now she has told me about this new guy, that he is treating her so good and she has now seen how good a relationship can be. That we will never be together again. But she wants us to be good friends, and she loves me as a friend. So she has this friend who is the friendliest and most empathetic person that I know of. My ex-wife told me that she is also breaking up with her man, who had done very bad things. Our relationship was nothing compared to what was going on with them. This is a bad man, and I have heard about It before. So I sent her a message after considering It for  many days, even though I know Its quite suspicious to suddenly message her. I told her that I heard that they were having problems and that I wish them strength and I hope things will work out. This friend did not reply for 5 hours. When she replied, It was a bit cold. She told that they are separating and she is going to focus only on the children now.

My ex-wife came and visited and was angry about this. Why did I send her a message?! she demanded to know. What the hell am I imagining!? she was asking. If I try to hit on her, It will have consequences, she threatened.

Why is she so jealous?  I did not leave my wife for her girlfriend! My ex already has has a new guy that she thinks is really good. She likes me as a friend, but I am the only guy in the world who cannot see her friend. Also she doesn't allow her friend to see me. What If in some time my wife's friend is lonely and I am lonely, but she is happily together with the new guy and she says to us ""you are not allowed to see each other, because It would be uncomfortable to me!"" See my point? How can I explain this to my ex?

One more question:

I believe that this girlfriend actually does like me and wouldn't mind to have a coffee with me some day. I think what happened was when she got my message, she was first planning how to respond, then decided to first tell my ex about this, just to test how she would react! If my ex would have been like ""Well what's the problem with that? We aren't together and I have a new guy already"", then the girlfriend would have responded to me differently. How do you interpret this? If she truly would not have wanted me to contact me because she thought that It was wrong, she should/would have told me!?

Also, a year and a half ago, when It was my birthday and we were at the bar celebrating. My wife and her man was talking with other people, and she suddenly comes sitting next to me really close, pushing her side against me. Then she caresses the back of my neck, looks me in the eyes and says ""Happy birthday"" in the most sensual way you can imagine. She also asks me to dance with her, when a very slow song is played, but I tell her I would not want to make others jealous. Ok she was not sober at all! But no matter how drunk I would be, I wouldn't be like that If I didn't like someone somehow.

Also once my ex-wife, after we broke up, said: ""Sometimes I think that you and someone, a friend of mine would be so suitable for each other, but I don't want to say more because I would be s jealous"" And there is no-one else that she could have meant. I also believe that this could be true. 

What's the strategy if I would like to meet her, but not break these friendships.

Not special in a superhero way—no capes, no laser vision—but different. The kind of person who was meant for more. Big things. Not the guy who flinches when his EMIs start lining up like debt collectors.

And yet, today, as I woke up to a salary credit that was lighter than expected—thanks to tax deductions I had not planned for—I felt an unsettling jolt. A sudden, helpless agitation that made me jump out of bed. It was not about the money; it was about the realization that maybe I was just like everyone else.

As I sat alone, sipping my morning coffee, the weight of it sank in. The cycle of earnings, deductions, EMIs, and auto-debits—the silent expectations of the system—waiting for me to show up. Not as someone special, but as another cog in the machine.


Maybe this is how life humbles us. Year after year, moment after moment—sometimes through gentle nudges, sometimes through harsh truths—it reminds us that we are not as unique as we once thought. But never mind. This, too, shall pass. We live another day, fight another battle, and figure things out, one way or another.

Something else maybe?  From time to time, I ask people what ""woke"" means.  I get a variety of answers, nothing consistent, and sometimes it just boils down to nothing.  It's not as simple as not liking things.  Not everyone likes coffee, but that doesn't make coffee woke.  And it's not about legality.  Hanging twenty flags off your truck and rolling coal probably isn't within code, but it isn't woke!

Personally, I like ""alt-woke"".  It fits with other similar expressions.  And it captures the idea that if something is woke and should be avoided, there has to be an alt-woke alternative.  So blue hair = woke; but 50s hairstyles = alt-woke.

An unlike woke, it does have one clear usage.  If you're the sort of person that calls things woke, then by definition, you are alt-woke.

Your refrigerator is the heart of your kitchen. It keeps ingredients fresh and safe, allowing you to buy in bulk and reduce food waste.

1ieanow,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1ieanow/how_to_tell_apart_adhd_vs_adhddepression/,How to tell apart ADHD vs. ADHD+depression?,"It was suggested to me by my therapist to get an ADHD diagnosis, so I tried, but during their initial screening they said I have depression, and they won’t even do an ADHD assessment unless I’ve cured or attempted to cure my depression.

That made me really sad because although I definitely am depressed, I feel like it’s not the only thing that’s wrong with me. I could be wrong, but think I have some ADHD-like symptoms like stimming, hyper focus, time blindness, procrastination, delayed sleep syndrome, rejection sensitivity, emotional sensitivity, sound sensitivity, perfectionism, losing things a lot, clenching my jaw really bad & chewing my cheeks, “sound track brain”, task paralysis, coffee makes me sleepy, finding extremely basic tasks painfully boring and hard but highly complex tasks easy and fun, things like that.

I tried to explain to the person that I find it hard to eat or sleep regularly not because I’m too depressed to do so but because I might be (for example) writing thousands of lines of code in a hyper focus frenzy (I’m studying engineering) and then nearly pass out because I haven’t eaten all day. Things like that. But she said maybe I’m just a high functioning depressed person. But I don’t really feel high functioning. At least not at times or in areas I can control. So what kind of high functioning is that… Has anyone else been told something similar?

I don’t want to take depression meds so I’m at a bit of a standstill here. I’ve been trying to figure out how exactly you can tell whether you have just depression or ADHD + depression since I understand they often go hand in hand? But maybe I just have depression, I’m open to that too. What am I supposed to do here?

Painting the town red



There was uncertainty in my mind all these years. I never stop to think that my family was a part of an old history. Her words played in my head, I admit I was told little about my real mother… just that she died giving birth to me. In the next few days I continued to prepare the rough draft of the piece, the story was coming together but I knew there was so much I still didn’t know. *“ sir? Just wanted to drop off the rough draft, I hope I can write more on the piece…""*Vincent sat back his tired eyes looking over the computer screen, I didn’t know how to describe it but he seemed off… *“Thanks, just put it on my desk….* *Wait liz ....”* I froze, the tone of his voice seemed odd as he waved me back into his office. *“Yes sir…”* grabbing his coffee he only took a drink, *“ I wanted to thank you….”* I looked confused as I sat down, he seemed to pick up my piece and flip through the pages. *“ I'm sorry sir, I'm confused, thank you for what?” “ Ms. Smith called and told how sweet you were… you handled it really well.”* I smiled feeling a sense of pride as long as I had been working here, I only hoped for someone to see my hard work. *“ Your welcome I just knew she needed someone to listen from her side, well I can’t take all the credit…my friend gave me the idea about how to talk to her.”* he only rubbed his eyes looking unable to focus, *“ are you ok sir…you look sick..”* he only gave a weak smile nodding his head, *“ yeah i'm ok just been working late hours again… I will take this home and read it… I should be able to get back to you monday.”* I didn’t know what to even think I knew he had a habit of staying after to finish his work, I only nodded leaving his office worried that maybe he was coming down with something. By midafternoon I had almost forgotten about Vincent as my mind was focused on my own family…. *“ was the Evans really a part of our bloodline?”* there was only confusion in my mind as I got into my car, before all of this I was just your everyday reporter trying to make it.I must have spent countless hours in my office, thinking about nothing but my family and the possible chance that these abilities could aid in my search for the truth. *“Where to begin… I only know so much of my past…”*  I thought of my foster family wondering if they had been kept in the dark about this? 



*“ maybe start with my mother’s name and her life, that had to answer something…”* my mind was lost so much I didn’t know and yet all I wanted was peace from this hell. *“Liz … Maggie's on the phone..she sounds troubled”* I never knew maggie to lose her cool, in fact she was the most well balanced person you could ever meet. I thanked as he waved goodnight, quickly grabbing my phone and I dialed Maggie's number. It only rang twice before she answered, her quicken tone made me worry, *“thank god finally!!!! Something bad happened at the diner…. I can’t talk about it here…”* she was stressed that was for sure, I calmed her down telling her to meet me at my house… I knew by the tone in her voice she had seen something horrible. I was nervous the whole ride home, only preparing myself for whatever could have happened in this sleepy little town. Arriving home Maggie sat in my driveway. Her pale skin and shocked expression only made me fear what she knew, *“maggie you look horrible…please come in tell me what happened..”* she shook barely able to hold on to her keys, I helped her inside almost feeling her heart racing. *“ it was horrible liz I found her…. All that time in the police station answering all those damn questions.”* I looked lost, almost unsure of what she was even saiding, *“ Maggie just gave it to me straight…. You're losing me..”* she sat back on the couch trying to form the words, as tears fell down her face. *“ there was murder in the diner…. I found…robin laiding in the bathroom with her chest torn open! But her heart was stuck to the wall with a knife… oh god liz she was missing her head!!!* I froze another murder in rizepoint, thinking back to Vincent I wondered if that was why he was so off today. I let cry into my chest, her screams echoing in my ears, I felt odd as images filled my head… I could see through Maggie's eyes as she entered the bathroom. Robin’s body laid against the bathroom wall, as the rib cage was torn open blood flowing onto the floor… her heart pinned to the wall with an odd looking knife.



The fear building as Maggie's screams made the diner look up in shock, *“ what the hell!I'm so sorry you had to see that!!”* she looked almost confused before wiping away the hot tears, *“ robin was just an innocent little thing, we joked that she was the young blood in the diner… barely able to take the craziness during rush hour.”* I let her cry for another few minutes only thinking about the images that I saw, this was the second murder in rizepoint in just a few weeks and yet I wondered if mercy had anything to do with robin’s death. She stayed only for a few hours telling me everything, the police were no help of course grilling everyone in the place. *“ Maggie, I understand this all too much right now, but just breathe…. Maybe some rest will help. I will call tomorrow ok to see how you're doing, come let me help you to your car.”* I watched her drive out of view only hoping she would be ok, once back inside I grabbed the notebook feeling that same strange pull again… this time I was ready as I opened to the next page. *“ back again liz? You wish to learn more of the truth?” “ I have to know there has been another murder, and I feel you're not behind it…. Please let me in.”* she only grins accepting my request, as the bright light flooded the room. I stood back at the farm as the warm sun felt good against my skin, luca worked in field sweat rolling down his face…. As he looked tired and sick. *“Father, mother need you inside… lunch is ready…”* Again mercy rushed past me looking worried as her father pulled another box of food into the shed. Wiping the sweat from his face he nods following mercy back toward the house, *“ your father looks sick in this memory please tell me he will be ok….”* mercy’s ghostly figure stood next to me only looking on with a certain sadness, she didn’t answer at first but only waved for me to follow her. 



Inside the house the family sat quietly as her mother passed plates around, their meal was barely even enough to fill their bellies. *“ we suffered so much more since the judge ordered double of our crops… you notice something off liz?”* I looked closely at the table only noticing three plates that laid on the oak top, *“ your sister she is not here….”* I was lost for words as only imagining what could happen, *“ yes Abby was sick with the plague, my mother tried her best to help her but when the judge was told of her illness….. He did something horrible that changed my family forever… I would rather not say.”* that was anger in her voice. Clearly he had killed poor Abby just to keep the sickness away from the village, only now I knew what was wrong with her father. *“ Father, I can finish your work for you…. You need to rest!”* he seemed almost taken back as the family looked scared, *“ no this my sin to carry…mercy I understand but he already killed your sister.. In front of us all of things… I can’t even get her little cries of pain out of my head.”* luca had lost so much that he had now taken on the work in order for his family to live, the bright light again blinded me but this time I felt an odd chill that filled me with dread. I now stood deep in the woods, mercy and her mother weeping over two tombstones. *“ my father only lasted a few more months before winter, we were alone and scared of the judge*…  *I took on the task of making sure that the village had food for the winter.”* no words were spoken in this moment, only the stillness of the woods around us. *“ you must go! The darkness is not far…they know when you are here… leave liz save yourself!”* her cold fingers wrapping around my body, as the bright light swallowed me I awoke again watching the notebook hit the floor…. I was confused who she was so scared of…even in death she was running from something. Again I wondered about my connection with the evans, there had to be answers… Only now I wasn’t sure if time was on my side any longer. All that night I went through everything about my family, only finding what I already knew… I wanted to scream how could my past be hidden so well? 



There was a certain dread that seemed to stay with me no matter how I tried…it was stronger than I could fight. By early morning I laid back on my bed feeling myself drafting off to sleep, again I was standing in the woods a light snowfall fell around me. *“Where am I…”* my voice sounded different almost like I wasn’t myself, the sound of screaming and yelling echoed around me I panicked and started into a dead run….  *“ Get the witch!!!! Find her…….”* I was being hunted by an unknown force… a group hell bent on killing me. I must have ran forever. I felt like I was running in place as the same trees towered around me, *“ leave me alone I didn’t do anything wrong… mother! Where  is my mother?”* they crowded around me blocking my way, as a strange tall man stood out from the rest… *“ liz val I know what you're doing, the secrets you keep… now I will come for you… see you soon!”* I was shocked awake trying to catch my breath only I felt like I was dying, again smoke seemed to fill my lungs. *“ focus liz don’t let their darkness take you….. We still need to end this terror.”* her voice filled my head almost like a strange angel watching over me, I fought back letting her world push the smoke from my body. Finally I could breathe again as I sat up in bed, my alarm buzzing in my ear, my body was shaking but I could feel her still near me. I spent half the morning just trying to understand the change I had undergone, my life was so different since the notebook. Only now I knew what needed to be done. Grabbing my phone I called Maggie who seemed in a better mood, still she seemed shaken by everything. 



*“ I'm still not able to sleep… nightmare of robin’s body was all I could dream… liz you look tired as well..the same thing?”* I wondered just how much I should let Maggie in on, after all she had alway trusted me to tell her the truth. I swallowed my fear and began to speak, unsure of how to begin. *“Remember the box that lady rose gave me?”* I waited as she nodded her head unsure of what to think, *“something happened when I opened it, I know this is going to sound strange..maybe even crazy but inside was mercy’s notebook her life written into the pages.* She sat back thinking about everything that had happened between the first and second murder, things seemed to become clear to us both. *“Did you read something horrible? Did mercy have a dark past?”* I only paused before bringing the notebook over to the table, she studied it for a few moments before asking to hold it. *“ I don’t know… it did something strange to me you see I didn’t read but saw everything like I was in a day dream.”* she looked almost confused before placing her hand upon my head, *“ what are you doing?” “ checking to see if you're sick… I mean you're talking crazy…”* I admit I was prepared for that answer, Maggie was open minded but to a limit she alway had to see it for herself before she would believe you. *“I'm not crazy…. Fine give me a second…""* She only looked nervous before I placed my hands on her, closing my eyes I felt an odd pull, before I could see her standing in the doorway crying out for someone…only she sounded younger, almost in her teenage years. I could feel her hot tears almost like I wasn’t myself again, it was all clear now this was a memory one that she must keep to herself…. Only her father was still alive. He seemed to bend down, giving her a hug telling her he was sorry for all of this, and to take care of her mother for him….. *“ Im seeing your father he bends down hugging onto you..while your mother yells at him from the entrance way. You beg him not to go, but he ensures it’s best that he leaves…. You never knew your parents were having issues. Wait, now I'm seeing you and mother standing at the door again, but your mother is crying out as a police officer tells the both of you…about your father.”* she pulls herself away from me, almost unable to understand what happened. 



*“ how!? I never told anyone about that…. And you saw all in my memories… holy shit what did that book do to you?* She almost fall back before catching herself, *“ I'm sorry if that was a memory you didn’t know the world to see, I can’t help it whatever you're thinking about I can see and things of your past… mercy had given me this ability.”* she only stood again before grabbing her keys, I watched her rush out the door unable to accept what I was saiding. I tried calling her all through the day, but she only seemed to not answer… I didn’t blame her, I awakened something she didn’t want to remember. All through the rest of the week she seemed to avoid all together, I felt alone for once in my life…. Maggie was my balance. By monday I arrived at my job heartbroken, only wanting to be left alone… there was a cold fearful dread that made me wish I wasn’t there at all. *“ liz good you're here can we talk for a minute?”* Vincent stood in my doorway holding my piece in his hand, he seemed almost pale looking like he had become worse over the weekend. *“Sure come in… you look sick sir… you good?”* he only settled into the chair before looking at himself in the nearby mirror, *“ I know I look horrible…i'm on my way out..just wanted to tell you I loved your paper… so much I wanted you to do a full story on it… I'm giving you the front page.”* I froze as he smiled. This was the break I had been waiting for, I quickly nodded, promising to start the real story. This little bit of news brightened my day, in fact I almost forgot about maggie… until lunch had rolled around. *“ I should just eat at home… Maybe look at starting this story for vincent.""* The drive home was odd to say the least, the diner was still closed down due to robin’s murder..police had reported until they went over the whole crime scene no one was allowed inside.



Gathering my notes in front of me I felt good knowing I had most of the information, the only thing missing was anything about robin and her murder. The police would be no help of course, after all they loved to hide all the details from any reporter who asked. There was only one way to know anything about robin, *“ of course the diner the police had shut it down…think liz the person who could have helped you….* The sadness seemed to hit me hard, had I wronged Maggie by going into her hidden past? Either way she was the only one who could have let me inside the diner, sitting back I didn’t know what to do..like a lost child my mind was filled with fear and doubt. *“ don’t give up liz…. There had to be another way…”* she voice was calm and inviting, almost making me feel like I had an angel to look after me. *“ How mercy? Maggie won’t talk to me…. And I don't think she even answers my text…* *“ she isn’t the only person you know ... .who works at the diner…”* I was confused at first, unable to focus on her words, only for a few anyway as her mother’s image had come into my mind. Betty was like a second mother to me, she alway made sure I was taken care of as a kid… I wondered if she could help me now? Grabbing my phone I stopped knowing the risks, how would Maggie feel if I asked her mother about looking into the diner?

Petrol included, the price is 4000 THB. The trip starts off well—our driver is a lady, a bit chatty, but we enjoy conversing, so all good.

Our first stop is for coffee. GF and I order for ourselves, and as we’re paying, I notice the driver hovering near the counter. Out of courtesy, I ask if she’d like one too, she says yes, and we pay for it. No big deal, just a small gesture.

We hit some temples in Chiang Rai, and soon, it’s lunchtime. We ask her to drive us to a restaurant we picked out—one of the more popular spots in town, with banging reviews. She parks in the restaurant’s lot, and I tell her we’ll be back after lunch. I assume she’ll either wait in the car or go do her own thing. GF heads inside to find us a table while I take a call.

A couple of minutes later, as we settle into our seats, I realize she’s still behind us. Not just inside the restaurant but actively following us around. And then—she sits down. At our table. With my GF. GF looks absolutely flustered, but I’m still on my call, so I can’t intervene. We exchange looks, trying to silently communicate: What is happening?

A few minutes pass, and now GF has to take a work call too. She pulls out her laptop, clearly needing to focus, but the driver just stays put. Staring at her screen. At this point, GF is visibly annoyed, and after a moment, she tells her, “I need to work.” There’s an awkward silence, and the driver gets up and leaves.

We eat in peace, but now we’re both wondering—were we rude? Is this normal in Thailand? Are private drivers expected to join their passengers for meals? Was she hoping we’d buy her lunch? Should I have tipped her? Just typing this out as we head back to Chiang Mai, still a little confused.",26,1738312428.0,ThailandTourism,40,0.88,False

Eden Frost adjusted her sleeves on her fluffy cashmere sweater while walking into the office. Eden prided herself on being different from most cold and calculated CEOs. She delighted in knowing her employees by name and checking in on their families. Most importantly, she wanted to feel human. After all, being the CEO of the biggest tech company in the U.S. was no easy task.

A sudden movement caught her attention. She looked to her left and noticed that one of her engineers, Margaret Pointe, one of the new hires, looked a bit tense. Sat on the edge of her chair, eyes tied to the screen, slumped over her keyboard.

“Margaret, is everything okay?”

“Yes,” murmured Margaret, giving Eden a tired smile. “I’m just having trouble with this report. I want it to be perfect for my first meeting here at the company.”

Eden took a long look at Margaret. She looked drained, as if she’d been sitting in front of that computer screen all night, and by the looks of the six coffee cups sitting on her desk, she had.

Eden said to Margaret, “Take the day off. You need to take a breath, recoup, and come back tomorrow.”

Margaret started to protest but quickly reevaluated her decision. “Thank you, Ms. Frost.”

Margaret quickly took her leave as Eden stepped into the elevator, ascending to the 50th floor.

“Good morning, Ms. Frost, and congratulations on the new launch!” Jonah’s usual enthusiasm was in full force. “I heard that it went exceptionally well, and it should’ve, given how much time, planning, and mon—”

“Jonah, please, you’re rambling again. We’ve talked about this,” Eden murmured, pinching the bridge of her nose.

“Yes, yes, we have, Ms. Frost,” Jonah said, visibly embarrassed. “I’m sorry. But this letter came for you this morning.”

Eden gently took the letter from Jonah, quickly glancing over it, and confidently strode into her office.

Eden took a look at the blank envelope. “That’s strange. There’s no return address.”

She hesitated but tore open the envelope.

The letter read:

Don’t forget what you did.

For a slight moment, dread filled the pit of her stomach, but Eden scoffed at the letter and quickly threw it in the trash.

“Just another scare tactic. Sparks Enterprises is gonna have to do a lot better than that.”

As Eden began to log into her computer, her cellphone vibrated.

1ieaa3w,https://www.reddit.com/r/n64/comments/1ieaa3w/n64_no_videosignal/,N64 No Video/Signal,"Hi everyone,

I’m having an issue with my **Nintendo 64** – it powers on (**red LED lights up**) but does not output any video signal. I’ve already performed extensive troubleshooting but haven’t found the root cause. Here’s a breakdown of what I’ve checked so far:

**Troubleshooting Steps Taken:**

✅ **Power indicators:** The red LED turns on after switching the console on.

✅ **Voltage regulators checked:** **12V, 5V, 3.3V, 2.5V, 1.25V** are present.

✅ **Reset button checked** – confirmed it is not stuck or continuously closing.

✅ Used a **laboratory power supply** instead of the regular N64 power adapter.

✅ **Power bypassed ON/OFF switch** to rule out switch issues.

✅ **RCP, CPU, RAM, cartridge slot, and Expansion Pak slot** checked for contact issues.

✅ **Reflowed RCP and CPU** to eliminate potential solder joint issues.

✅ Tried **multiple video cables and adapters.**

✅ Thoroughly cleaned everything with **99.99% isopropyl alcohol.**

✅ Pressed **cartridge and Expansion Pak** firmly while powering on.

✅ **Tested games and Expansion Pak in another N64** – they work fine.

✅ **Re-soldered** power and AV output connectors.

**Observations & Potential Issues:**

⚠️ **Capacitors (C81, C131, C134, C140, C141, C145)** show continuity but **no capacitance** when measured with a multimeter.

⚠️ **RCP is getting significantly hotter than the CPU.**

⚠️ **CPU heat distribution (without heatsink):** Only the center reaches \~40°C.

⚠️ **U4 temperature:** \~60°C.

⚠️ **U13 temperature:** \~50°C.

⚠️ **U14 temperature:** \~35-40°C (which is **10-15°C hotter than U11**).

⚠️ **PCB was very dirty** before cleaning, especially with brown residue (looked like **coffee or cola?**). It looked similar to the residue often found near controller ports.

⚠️ **VCC and VSS on CPU/RCP measure \~45Ω when unplugged.**

⚠️ **Power supply measurements:** The **original power supply delivers 12.45V**, but after powering on, the voltage rises to **14.2V**. However, **3.3V and 5V rails seem stable.**

**What Could Be the Issue?**

I’m wondering if the **capacitors** are bad and causing the problem or if the **RCP overheating** is a sign of failure. Could the **higher-than-expected voltage (14.2V instead of 12V)** be affecting components?

Any advice on where to go from here would be greatly appreciated!

A bad day and an involuntary dose of caffeine and I’m white knuckling it through a sleepless night. Even if I drink the caffeinated drink at 8 am I still won’t be able to sleep. 

But I do like to drink decaf because the tiny amount of caffeine I get perks me up. For every 4-5 fancy decaf drinks I get from a coffee shop, I will get one mistakenly caffeinated one and it’s gotten to the point I cannot trust baristas to make it right. It’s alarming how often they mess up my decaf order. 

I was not able to make it myself when I was traveling last week and so I went to a coffee shop and asked for decaf when I was ordering. Then I again asked the barista making it if it was decaf when he handed it to me. He said yes and I drank half of it before my heart started pounding. I stopped as soon as I knew it was caffeinated. I was really mad because I asked twice to make sure it was decaf. When I got back from the trip I wrote a bad review and included the persons name which I remembered because he had the same name as my brother’s best friend. 

I got a reply from the business on my Google review yesterday. It said that the person who I named was made aware of the issue, it’s being addressed and they apologize for the mistake which is the only reply to any of my bad reviews about getting caffeine when I asked for decaf. I’m really happy and told my partner and she got mad and said it really wasn’t fair to the barista because he was probably overworked and only made the mistake because of short staffing. She was a barista so I get she was sympathetic to the barista but I also didn’t sleep and had a huge presentation the next day which was horrible and ruined my trip. I got mad and told her from my standpoint as a customer it’s not my business how the mistake happened. All I knew is a person who I checked with gave me caffeine when I asked for none and it affected me negatively and I’m allowed to complain about it.

In 2017 I had my first svt episode and I went back to sinus on my own (never knew that was svt until years later) fast forward 2019 I had it happen to me another time I went back on my own (doctors prescribed me vermapil daily) and later in 2019 it happened again to me and I went to the er with a 225bpm heart rate. First dose of adenosine half worked then I slipped back into svt and the second dose of adenosine put me back into sinus rhythm (hurt like hell) now after the hospital one I was prescribed metoprolol and it worked for years up until this year about November I was highly sleep deprived and drank a lot of coffee doing very strenuous activities ( racing motocross) and I had svt I immediately knew what it was and after bearing down and blowing into a straw for 45 minutes I broke the svt but it left me in a fib at a normal heart rate I went to the hospital and they gave me cardizem and I converted back the next morning. Now I went to see an absolutely amazing and very smart EP and cardiologist and I decided it was time for an ablation. He found 2 spots in my heart where afib was coming from and one on the other side ( he mentioned something about a passage way I think) and the abalted 3 spots and sent me on my way in good condition and the EP was very confident there is a 90% chance it will never come back. Now I write this to everyone because 1. I want to hear similar stories not because I don’t trust my doctors opinion because I know he is a damn smart guy and has worked on family friends and really done an amazing job and he truly is a smart EP with Ana amazing track record. But I want to hear other stories to help comfort or educate me as this has been a massive mental fight inside me for a long time as many of you know this stuff is extremely traumatizing and I built up some confidence after not having it for a few years but before the incident before the ablation absolutely wiped out all the confidence I had and even though I had a successful ablation( I hope it continues this way!) I am still extremely nervous to do certain things. Now I will say as for the ablation I had it done 3 weeks ago and I have felt amazing every day since. If you are scared or nervous about getting one done genuinely don’t be I am the most anxious and paranoid person ever and honestly it was not bad at all the worst part is the ditches on your leg from where they enter. I just wonder if there is people in a similar situation as me and what there stories like because I’m just your average 24 year old healthy make don’t smoke or drink I have a nice diet and this was all just a horrible time and I’m hoping I finally got to the end and I think I did. The best advice I could give if you are going to get an ablation find someone who you trust and who is highly recommend. The guy who did mine was extremely smart, answered every question and I genuinely trust him with my life and I’m happy I got it done. I was highly impressed at how smart these guys truly are it is mind boggling and they are heaven sent. He probably changed my life more than I know.
