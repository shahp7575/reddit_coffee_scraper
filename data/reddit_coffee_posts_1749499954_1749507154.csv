(If not, you should be!!) It’s so freaking cute with all the little characters!!! And helps me track everything super easy. I was getting WAY less fluids in per day than I thought I was. 🥴 It’s got me googling everything I drink for their hydration percentage so I can track what’s giving me the best hydration. 

Made me back off of Coke Zero a lot the last few days. The extra caffeine was making me intake more fluids for less hydration… 

In the morning, I’ve been having coffee with creamer and torani caramel syrup to get my caffeine fix, then sip flavored water the rest of the day and maybe have a 7Up Zero or two (caffeine free and gives 99% hydration) when I want carbonation. (7Up Zero Tropical is SOOOOO GOOD!!) I STRUGGLED the first few days of tracking it to get to a gallon. But I hit my goal yesterday! Hopefully today too!! 🤞🏻 

PS — everyone else peeing ridiculous amounts drinking this much!? 🥴🥴🥴 ",1,1749507048.0,breastfeeding,0,1.0,False

Severance. It's such a weird word. Like, severe. Severed. Makes you think of... deli meats? But fancy. Anyway, Kier Eagan. That guy. His portrait. The *stare*. Does he blink? Has anyone *checked*? Probably not, because blinking is probably against the handbook or something, like unsanctioned eye lubrication. They'd get points docked. Points for what? Nobody knows! Maybe for a better kind of coffee pod? The coffee in MDR looks... beige. Like lukewarm sadness in a mug. Do they even *have* sugar? Or is sweetness a perk reserved for Macrodata Refinement Level 5? Level 5 probably gets... I dunno... slightly less beige coffee? Or maybe a tiny biscuit. A Kier-shaped biscuit. Crunchy.

Speaking of MDR, those numbers. Just... swirling. What *are* they? Seriously. Are they... bad vibes? Quantified ennui? Like, is ""4"" just a mild Tuesday sigh, and ""9"" is full existential dread? Why do they need refining? Can't the bad vibes just... stay bad? Who are they refining them *for*? The board? Do the board members sit around going, ""Mmm, yes, Helly R. really purified that batch of 7s today, exquisite work, tastes faintly of despair and toner""? And the Break Room. Apologies. Endless apologies. To whom? The numbers? Kier? The perpetually empty vending machine? ""I'm sorry the number 8 felt melancholic today."" Ridiculous! But also terrifying. Like a dentist's waiting room designed by Kafka. With worse magazines. Do they even *have* magazines? Probably just pamphlets about Kier's childhood oat consumption.

Outties! What a weird concept. Like, your *other* you. The one who... buys groceries? Pays taxes? Watches cat videos? Does my outtie like cilantro? Because *I* find it deeply suspicious. Does my outtie leave laundry in the washer too long? I bet they do. The audacity! Leaving *my* innie-self potentially facing Kier's wrath over mildewy metaphorical socks! It's irresponsible! Outties have all the fun, probably. Sunshine! Birds! Remembering their own birthdays! Meanwhile, innie-me is trying to decipher if a ""Waffle Party"" involves actual waffles or just a PowerPoint slide of a waffle while someone hums the company anthem. It's probably the slide. Kier wouldn't waste good syrup. Syrup is probably Level 7.

And Harmony Cobel! Mrs. Selvig! Who *is* she, really? Is she Kier's ghost? A very committed cosplayer? Does she knit those weird goat things *in character*? Imagine her at home, Mrs. Selvig mode, humming cheerfully while making a casserole, then BAM! Slips into Cobel voice: ""THE CASSEROLE LACKS KIER'S VISION, MILDRED! IT EMITS HOSTILE NUMBERS! APOLOGIZE TO THE OVEN!"" And the goats! Why goats? Is Kier secretly a goat? Was his favorite childhood pet a goat named... Severus? Goat Severance! That should be a spin-off. Goats wandering endless identical hallways, refining existential hay. Bleating apologies in the Break Barn. Needing waffle parties involving actual, delicious, non-metaphorical oats. See? This is why I can't sleep. Lumon. It’s all just… beige coffee and unanswered goat questions. Forever. Probably. Kier wills it.",1,1749506896.0,okbuddyseverance,0,1.0,False

I’m a fun and adventurous guy seeking a Dominant woman who is interested in a Female Led Relationship.

I’m 34, 5’11”, I live an active lifestyle, a bit nerdy, and can be a bit shy when first meeting people.

In my Vanilla life, I have my life together and work a full time job in Tech. On my free time, I love making art, playing video/board games, planning out travel trips, concerts, and hanging out with friends.

In the bdsm world, I’d love to find a dominant to serve. I love the rituals, giving up controls, and focusing entirely on my partner. I enjoy being caged, love bondage, following directions, pegging, body worship, and humiliation. I’m not into findom and am not interested in pro-dommes. I would like to develop a meaningful relationship with a power dynamic involved. I hope to meet a goddess to serve soon!

If you would be interested in chatting and meeting up for coffee or brunch, feel free to shoot me a message!

1l7i1n8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l7i1n8,[help] house bathtub water lickage issue...,"Hi all (couldn't think of any nor a better title for my issue/question)...

So, I'm having an issue regarding my bathroom's bathtub and the kitchen that directly below it... 

I sometimes fill up my tub with (warm or cool to cold) water and than sit for a little bit to relax on my work-off day. For 6 years now I've not had an issue of water lickage in my kitchen but today it suddenly happened. It is not a wall cracking/breaking amount of water licking but only water droplets coming off the kitchen ceiling. But it's faar more concerning as the lickage is through a ceiling lamp light...I'll not be switching on my kitchen light for 24-48 hours for safety...I'm not sure, Maybe it was because I had mistakenly filled my tub with warn-hot water, drained it and immediately filling the tub with cool water!? Or maybe the cool water condensed around the pipe directly above the ceiling lamp light!? I truly don't know...

But I'm not sure why this happened, how to proceed and how to prevent this in the future (while still being able to fill up the tub with water and sit in for a bit, or maybe completely forget about doing that ever again!?...) 

I swear, the houses here are made of cardboard and paper... 🤦🏼🤬😢

Appreciate any helpful advises/suggestions, please and many thanks 🙏🏼.",1,1749506875.0,Brampton,0,1.0,False
1l7i1dh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l7i1dh,Concept Idea of killer and survivor based on Ro-Bio/Ro-Chanics,"(Sorry for my English, I'm writing everything through a translator.)

  
**Killer - Researcher Class:**

I made him a burnt face because: Firstly, I wanted to make him look more like the other killer characters; Secondly, in the original games, I couldn't find any one design that would fit here as the main one, taking into account that the player character can also be a woman in the original plays. (Although now I understand that it would be better if I made it bandaged, because it would be more logical.)



I'm not the best at balancing and describing abilities, but I tried to at least roughly describe them:

1. A sip of coffee - increases the player's speed several times for a short time. (For balance, you can make it so that the scientist himself is slow.)

2. Take a sample - in fact, it is a blow like C00lkidd, but a little stronger (maybe slows down survivors for a while.)

3. Injection - the scientist injects something into the survivor and he either slows down, or his HP begins to gradually decrease.

4. Chip - an attack similar to injection, but with less damage and the survivor is marked for some time for the killer. After this, the killer is imposed slowness.

(Maybe a couple more attacks, but I could not think of anything else original).

  
**Survivor - Experimental subject:**

Most likely, the Experimental subject would be a survivalist, whose abilities were shown as he injects himself with various things using an injector.



1. Glowing eyes - would create light from the eyes that attacks the killers. The cooldown of this ability would be long to prevent abuse of the system.

2. Sticky Trail - created a trail behind the player that would slow down the killers, but after the end of the ability the player himself would get slowness.

(I just couldn't think of anything more for the Experimental subject at the moment.)",1,1749506854.0,FORSAKENROBLOX,1,1.0,False

""Daddy, Aunt Vivienne's having your baby.""
 ""This time, without Mommy's bad genes, it's gotta be a smart little brother, right?"" 
My husband replied casually, also in French: 
""Of course. But you're pretty great too—you didn't get too much of your mom's genetic mess.""
 I listened quietly, but my hand instinctively went to my belly. 
This time, I'm having a child with no ties to their bloodline. 
They wouldn't object, would they?

My husband Carter Kingsley's whole family has never liked me.

That much, I've always known.

His father avoids all family matters like the plague.

His mother looks down on my middle-class background.

And Carter? 

His heart was never mine to begin with.

But our son, Ethan Kingsley, is six now.

Bright. Charming.

And I just couldn't bring myself to leave him.

He even started learning French—and picked it up fast.

Now he and Carter talk in French around the house like it's their own secret club.

At first, I was proud.

A child I gave birth to, so smart, making his father proud.

It made me want to hold on to this family, even just a little longer.

Until I started secretly studying French myself.

And slowly, I began to understand what they were really saying.

And little by little, my heart froze over.

Turns out my own child, just like his father, was learning French not for school,

But to please Vivienne—the woman Carter's always loved.

Vivienne, the childhood sweetheart who went off to France for grad school.

They were inseparable once,

But Carter's churchgoing, conservative parents rejected her—

Not for who she was, but because a pastor-turned-""counselor"" told them she was a poor match for the Kingsley legacy.

Meanwhile, I—a girl from an average Ohio family—was married into this Manhattan dynasty because that same counselor said I would bring ""stability and prosperity.""

So I spent the last seven years in a marriage built on a prophecy—and completely devoid of love.

I was lost in thought when the sharp clang of Carter's fork against his plate snapped me out of it.

He frowned like he always does when I take a second too long to think.

""Vivienne's back in the States. She's pregnant.""

""She'll be moving in so we can help take care of her.""

His eyes locked on me, full of warning.

""She's carrying a child now. Don't start any drama.""

Yeah. Pregnant women are delicate.

Funny how that didn't apply when I was the one pregnant.

Back then, only the baby mattered—never me.

Even when I hemorrhaged during labor,

As long as Ethan made it out of the delivery room alive,

Carter never even came to check if I survived.

I nodded. 

I didn't ask who the baby's father was.

Back in the day, if Vivienne had tried to get even close to this house,

I would've lost my mind.

I fought. Screamed.

And Carter only ever gave me cold indifference.

But now, after understanding everything they whisper in French, I felt nothing.

""I'll move out for a while,"" I said. 

""Give her space to rest.""

Carter paused.

Before he could respond, Ethan lit up with joy.

""If Mommy's gone, does that mean I can be with Aunt Vivienne every day?""

Even the smartest kid can't hide how he really feels.

Carter stared into my eyes.

Was he trying to figure out what I was planning?

Or if I even had the strength left to care?

For a second, maybe I imagined it—but I thought I saw something soft flicker in his gaze.

Still, Vivienne and her baby came first.

Carter said gently, ""The house is big. No need to move out.

But we have a place out in Westchester.

I'll have it signed over to you.

You can go there whenever you want… clear your head.""

I understood.

This was my reward for ""being mature.""

He hated that I might have tainted the family line.

So now he was making sure his first love could carry their perfect child.

No matter the cost.

And he was willing to be generous about it.

Which made me wonder—

When the baby I'm carrying is born, will he be even more generous?

After all, this time, I made sure Carter has nothing to do with it.

Vivienne moved in early that morning.

I was in the garden watering and trimming my cosmos flowers.

They were the only things in this cold, loveless house that bloomed because of me.

Vivienne held her pregnant belly with one hand, covering her nose with the other.

""Don't bother trimming them,"" she said with a dramatic sigh. 

""I can't stand the smell. Just get rid of them.""

I stood and wiped some dirt off my cheek.

Vivienne squinted at me, then seemed to realize something.

""Oh—sorry, didn't realize it was you, Sienna.""

'I thought you were the gardener.""

She offered a tight smile.

""Well, if these flowers are yours, I guess you'd be too sentimental to tear them out.""

""I'll just deal with it.""

Carter, standing beside her with a hand on her lower back, frowned.

""You're pregnant. You don't have to ‘deal with' anything.""

""It's just a bunch of flowers. Get rid of them.""

I glanced down at the garden and gave a small smile.

Carter thought I was hesitating, ready to scold me.

But instead, I nodded. 

""Sure. I've got something to do soon anyway.""

""Just have the gardener take care of it.""

Carter paused, caught off guard by how calmly I agreed.

For a second, I thought I saw a flicker of sympathy in his eyes.

""I'll have them replanted at the Westwood property,"" he said softly. 

""I know you put a lot into them.""

I did love those flowers.

They were one of the few things I had to hold on to in this house.

But now, it didn't matter anymore.

""Whatever you think is best,"" I replied.

I checked my phone—my meeting with the investigator was in thirty minutes.

I gave them both a polite nod. 

""Excuse me.""

As I stepped past Carter, he suddenly grabbed my wrist.

Vivienne looked at him, confused and slightly annoyed.

He let go immediately.

""Come back early,"" he said. 

""There's something I need to talk to you about.""

I nodded. 

""Sure.""

The moment I left the Kingsley estate, I could breathe again.

Even if it was just for a little while.

I met the investigator at a coffee shop downtown—the same one I used to frequent back in college.

The owner did a double take when she saw me.

I guess I didn't look like the girl she remembered.

Ever since marrying Carter, I hadn't really lived.

The Kingsleys thought places like this were too... common.

The investigator handed me a file.

""The ultrasound confirms Vivienne is about four months along.""

""Which... doesn't match Mr. Kingsley's timeline.""

So Carter's miracle child—wasn't even his.

If he found out, would he be disgusted?

Would he still want the baby just because it's Vivienne's?

I looked up at the investigator.

""If I don't divorce him, my child still has inheritance rights, right?""

""Of course,"" he said without hesitation.

I pressed a hand to my belly.

""And what if the baby's not his?""

He blinked, visibly thrown.

""Well... if you're married, he's still legally obligated to support the child. But—""

I cut him off with a shake of my head.

That was all I needed to hear.

If Carter expected me to raise his child with Vivienne...

Then why couldn't I let him raise a child that wasn't his?

When I got home, Eleanor Kingsley was fussing over Vivienne like she was a princess.

They both looked up the moment I walked in.

Their smiles dropped.

Carter frowned. 

""Didn't I tell you not to come back yet?""

I chuckled. 

""You told me to come back early.""

""Said you had something to talk about.""

Carter hesitated.

He clearly forgot.

He cleared his throat. 

""Doesn't matter now.""

""The annual family dinner—Vivienne's handling it this year.""

Every year, I handled that dinner.

Because I was the Kingsley family's official wife.

It was my duty.

Eleanor nitpicked everything I ever did for those dinners.

The menu, the flowers, the lighting—nothing was ever good enough.

But at least it came with the title.

Now that Vivienne was here, even that had been handed to her.

I gave a tight-lipped smile. 

""Sure. It's your house, your call.""

Carter frowned, like he expected me to fight back.

Eleanor sniffed, pleased. ""At least you know your place.""

She turned to Vivienne, her voice warm.

""If you run into any trouble, just let me know, sweetheart.""

Vivienne gave her a bashful smile, and Carter melted all over again.

They launched into planning, forgetting I was still in the room.

Laughing together.

Ethan sat beside Vivienne, gently patting her belly.

""This dinner's for my baby brother!""

They looked like the perfect little family.

And I—

I was just background noise.

I walked upstairs without another word.

For days, I stayed out of sight.

They loved it.

Everyone was busy helping Vivienne plan the big event.

But this wasn't her world.

She got overwhelmed quickly.

I overheard her one evening, curled up in Carter's arms.

""I can't even get a stupid dinner right... I'm useless.""

Carter held her tighter. 

""No, baby. You're doing great. It's your first time.""

The next night, Carter knocked on my door.

That alone was unusual.

When I opened it, he didn't waste time.

""Vivienne's overwhelmed.""

""She's pregnant, and this dinner is a lot. Help her out.""

I smiled.

""When I handled my first dinner, I was eight months pregnant.""

He looked surprised.

Like he'd only just remembered that.

Back then, I was on my feet every day, planning menus and centerpieces, weeks from giving birth.

No one offered to help.

No one cared.

And now?

A little guilt on his face didn't mean a thing.

I cut him off before he could apologize.

""I'll help with the background stuff.""

'Let her handle the main event. She deserves to shine, right?""

Carter blinked, clearly thrown.

""You're really okay letting her take the spotlight?""

After all, the dinner was always the First Lady's stage.

And I was giving it up.

""She is carrying the next Kingsley,"" I said calmly.

Carter opened his mouth like he wanted to say something else.

But I'd already closed the door.

He stood there for a while.

Maybe realizing I wasn't the woman who used to beg for his attention.

Maybe realizing I didn't need him anymore.

The morning of the family brunch, I booked a one-way ticket overseas.

The whole Kingsley estate was buzzing with activity.

My son was dressed up like a little ring bearer, introducing Vivienne to everyone he met.

Everyone praised how charming he was, how well Vivienne had raised him.

No one seemed to care that I was his biological mother.

Even fewer cared that I was leaving.

I gave the house staff their final instructions and got ready to go.

I didn't have much to pack—everything I owned fit into a single crossbody bag.

Just as I stepped out the door, Carter appeared out of nowhere.

He was out of breath, like he'd been looking for me for a while.

When he saw the way I was dressed, like I was leaving for good, he froze.

""Where are you going?"" he asked.

I shook my head. 

""Doesn't matter.""

""What do you need?""

Carter pressed his lips together like he'd been wrestling with something for a long time.

""Thank you… for everything you did for the brunch.""

""Once all this is over, maybe we could have another baby.""

He smiled at me—

And I realized, in all the years we'd been married, I'd never seen him smile at me like that.

I gave him a polite, distant smile. 

""We'll talk about it later. Vivienne's calling you.""

He turned around, and sure enough, Vivienne was waving him over from the porch.

Carter took a step toward her, then paused and reached back to pat my hand.

""I meant what I said.""

""I promise I'll make it happen.""

""Okay.""

With that, Carter finally relaxed and walked off to join Vivienne.

We turned our backs on each other and walked away.

I headed straight to the private investigator's office.

He handed me a thick stack of evidence—Vivienne and several other men.

I flipped through the files, then handed them back to him.

""Send this to every media outlet in the city.""

""Have them publish it in exactly two hours.""

""And make sure they know—I'm still Mrs. Kingsley.""

The lawyer hesitated, but when he saw the fat retainer I handed him, he agreed.

Two hours later, my flight would be taking off.

On the way to the airport, I texted Carter:

[Turn on the news in two hours.]

He didn't reply.

By now, the family brunch had probably just kicked off.

An hour before departure, I got to the airport.

Check-in. Security. Boarding.

The chaos of it all left no time to check my phone.

But I did catch a glimpse of the Kingsley family brunch on the airport news screen.

Eleanor was holding Vivienne close, all warm and motherly.

""She may not be my daughter by blood,"" she said, ""but in my heart, she's always been family.""

My son Ethan clung to Vivienne's other arm, grinning, ""She's my real mommy!""

And Carter stood behind them, looking like the happiest man alive.

Five minutes before takeoff, I was buckled into business class.

The flight attendant reminded us to power down our phones.

So, I'm having an issue regarding my bathroom's bathtub and the kitchen that directly below it... 

I sometimes fill up my tub with (warm or cool to cold) water and than sit for a little bit to relax on my work-off day. For 6 years now I've not had an issue of water lickage in my kitchen but today it suddenly happened. It is not a wall cracking/breaking amount of water licking but only water droplets coming off the kitchen ceiling. But it's faar more concerning as the lickage is through a ceiling lamp light...I'll not be switching on my kitchen light for 24-48 hours for safety...I'm not sure, Maybe it was because I had mistakenly filled my tub with warn-hot water, drained it and immediately filling the tub with cool water!? Or maybe the cool water condensed around the pipe directly above the ceiling lamp light!? I truly don't know...

But I'm not sure why this happened, how to proceed and how to prevent this in the future (while still being able to fill up the tub with water and sit in for a bit, or maybe completely forget about doing that ever again!?...) 

I swear, the houses here are made of cardboard and paper... 🤦🏼🤬😢

Currently in marriage counseling, but I don’t think it’s helping at all. For context, he is older by 7 years. 

We dated for two years before he proposed and we dealt with a lot of cultural clashing on both sides of the family. Don’t wanna get into that too much since it is not the nucleus of the story. 

By no means do I fully blame him or fully blame me. We’ve both had our fuck ups, as do any couple. However, as of lately, we’re doing worse and worse. We have been waiting forever to know when he will get an internship for clinical counseling and it’s been a nonstop ordeal. It’s pertinent to our issues because it’s making him far more reactive to everything and I can’t imagine the stress one goes through with that. My main grievances are the fact that it seems like he always has justifications for his behavior and everyone has to fall in line with it, but if you have a justification for your behavior, it’s unacceptable. I’ve done everything that I possibly can to make his life easier, but I still, somehow, keep falling short because in his eyes I’m just clearly not enough for him. Yet neither of us can actually leave the marriage nor are we involving family or friends because we’re against that until or if a divorce is happening. 

His sleep schedule is absolutely ridiculous and refuses to take sleep meds because it gave him night terrors. It’s a battle I stopped fighting. Comes to bed at 4 or later, sleeps til 11-12, sometimes later. Out of consideration for him, our small dog and I do not make any noise and often keep ourselves in the bedroom because I do actually enjoy the quiet time when he sleeps. I use that time to go on TikTok after my morning coffee and meditation. Around noon or so, I’m typically hungry. 

Today, I apparently didn’t have the right energy when I got out of bed nor did I ask the right question to him about what it is that he wanted from me (stay in the bed, offer to make food, etc). Here’s the thing- he wants me to just “know”, but also wants me to check in and ask. I got up out of bed, and went to the kitchen to start prepping for lunch. I came back in the bedroom to get my headphones. He asked me 2x what the problem was and sometimes, idk what type of headspace he’s going to be in, so I naturally go in with the inclination that he’s gonna make it something that it isn’t so I’m naturally defensive. I at first told him nothing was wrong but then realized it’ll just be a big fight later if I’m not “transparent” enough  so I was like well you’re just laying there not really talking to me or engaging so I figured I’d get up and make food for us. 

This then turned into a bullshit ass argument in which I was told I needed to be with an avoidant partner who can match my avoidant energy and that me defending myself against him when I’m wrong isn’t a justifiable reason to defend myself. But he’s the type who, if you don’t give a thorough explanation of why you did or said XYZ or just any explanation at all, he turns it into a situation or scenario that it very isn’t just for the sake of it being that way for him to feel better about himself and I’m not going to let him be right because he feels like he’s allowed to be the only person who can be or have rights.

	2.	Full American breakfast – continental items plus hot food (scrambled eggs, croissants, bread pudding, chicken sausage, pork sausage, bacon), also with black coffee ($31)
	3.	Children’s breakfast

As a Platinum Elite member, I was entitled to the continental breakfast—pastries and black coffee—at no cost. If I wanted the Full American Breakfast, I would have had to pay the difference between the $31 price of the full breakfast and the $19 credit for the continental option, which came to $12 out of pocket. Alternatively, I could use the $19 credit toward any à la carte item, such as waffles, eggs, or a breakfast sandwich. Specialty coffee, including cappuccinos and iced lattes, came with an extra charge no matter what breakfast option I selected.

Monday morning, the buffet wasn’t available at all. The only option was to order from the à la carte menu using the $19 credit.

This setup caught me off guard. When I stay internationally at Marriotts, breakfast for Platinum Elite members typically includes the full buffet—no tiered pricing, no credit limits. The buffet usually includes a wide range of hot items, fresh pastries, yogurt, fruit, cheeses, salad, smoked salmon, and an egg station.

Is this tiered or credit-based breakfast model now standard at Westins in the U.S.? At all Marriotts in the U.S.? Or is this part of a broader trend among major hotel brands?

I hope this doesn’t start showing up in the Middle East or Southeast Asia.",5,1749506231.0,marriott,2,0.86,False

I’ve been a barista for Costa for almost two years and am going to have a trial shift for an independent cafe soon. This will be my first coffee job after costa and don’t know what to expect , as I know things are different at independent coffee shops.

Too many things there.
The supplements / vitamins etc take sooooo much space, and no matter what I did it gets messy within 24 hours.

Looking back, I feel like I could’ve been a little less cold, but I didn’t like one of the managers within the company and I found his behavior to be kind of inappropriate. For reference I’m 21F and he’s 34M and most of my female coworkers were between 20-27. I thought it was weird how close he was trying to get to all of us and how he wanted to hang out with us on our lunch breaks. Like one of my coworkers 24F said she was gonna grab a coffee and smoke a cigarette on her lunch break and he asked if he could join her which she seemed uncomfortable but said yes to. When I first met him he tried to chat with me on my break and ask about what my hobbies were and the music I listened to and I was kinda cold and I told him I didn’t have any hobbies and that I don’t listen to music to get him to shut up and stop talking to me. I’m a 21 year old girl. He’s a 34 year old guy who was also my boss. That’s creepy. Why are you talking to me and trying to befriend your younger female employees???? I also have an anxiety disorder and I tend to fidget and pick at my nails when I’m nervous and he called me out and said “OP what are you doing” and made a disgusted face at me and it made me feel embarrassed in front of all my coworkers :(. He also would get mad when we’d go on lunch breaks and rather than eat lunch with everyone and chat and socialize I’d choose to go to my car to smoke a cigarette by myself. Is that really that weird to not want to socialize with everyone on my lunch break??? I talked to all my other female coworkers and got to know them but kinda avoided conversing with him outside of work related stuff. He just rubbed me the wrong way with going out of his way to say performative feminist stuff and trying too hard to get to know his employees. I had only been working 3 weeks and he told me that I wasn’t a good fit for the company and that I should consider a different career path.

I currently own a 2012 Nissan Xterra with 203,000km on it. I purchased it from a sketchy used car dealership approximately 3 years ago. Car had clearly been in an accident. (Evident from the coffee stains all over the ceiling, however at the time I needed transportation).
It’s been an enjoyable car, though I’ve had to have the idle tuned higher to account for an awful resonation issue. The PCM crapped out a year in and has been replaced. Outside of that, just routine maintenance. I live in Canada so naturally rust is starting to eat away at various areas. I’ve had some patches welded to the exhaust just before the catalytic converter, however past the cat is after market stainless. The car itself has some noticeable bump steer which hasn’t been remedied with alignments. All in all, just feels fairly rickety when driving over rough terrain.

I have a job offer in a new province, which will involve a 2,500km drive to a new city where I won’t know anyone. I will be highly reliant on my car for transportation to and from work.

My credit is FAR improved, and I am now able to acquire a 2022 GMC Terrain from a more reputable dealership with just over 100,000km. (I am currently ensuring the cold air grille shutter is installed). The car itself is in great shape. 

Would you recommend making the switch to ensure reliability for a long drive to a new city, as well as having a longer lifespan after arrival? I’m tempted as the new interest rate with a higher credit score will save me a lot as well as lowering my payments, however I’m more perplexed on the mechanical side of things. 

Any feedback greatly appreciated.

The coffee shop she plugged in was closed when we got there. She asked if I'd take her to another coffee shop. I said sure and asked her to ask for the ride through the app. She told me she was just getting coffee to go and wanted to know if I'd take her back to her cottage. Again I said yes. On the way to take her back she mentioned she was heading to the airport and asked if I could take her and her colleague. She tipped me well for the coffee adventure so I said of course and asked her once again to request the ride through the Lyft app. The ride to the airport came up as $40.10, not a bad fare for a 45 minute drive. I dropped her and her colleague off without issues, she was very appreciative of all the running around I did on her behalf and after I hit the complete ride I saw the $56.60 total hit my daily total tab. 

Here's where it goes sideways; about 10 minutes later, I saw $61.60 less on my daily total. I thought weird but sometimes it pops up again without issues. Not this time, after my driving day I reached out to Lyft customer support to see what was going on. The person I talked to said it was taken away because it showed I manipulated the drive time for that ride -the app clearly shows the estimated and actual times are identical. They said the would flag it for further review. A bit later I got an email stating that Lyft took the fare(and tolls) AND added a five dollars penalty for abusing the platform but didn't say what I did. 

I wrote back, thinking it was a glitch or something regarding manipulation of drive time and showed them pics of what my app drive showed. 

They wrote back and said I wasn't allowed to take friends or family around and needed to let rides happen organically, ???  I don't even know what that means. 

The only way to get a hold of them is to respond to the email they sent out. I plead my case once again and they told me their decision stands. 

I'm mad about losing the money of course but I'm also livid at being  accused of doing something wrong. I also don't understand how they can, not only take my fare money away, but also the toll free and add a punitive fine without explaining exactly what I did wrong. 

My question is what recourse do I have? Every time I get through to customer service(not an easy task as they don't even have a number posted) they tell me that another department is taking care of this and the only recourse is to respond to the email they sent. 

Thanks for staying on this long rant. I'd really like to figure out how to connect with someone at Lyft that will actually look into what the heck happened.

He seems hella self-aware about it and he even says ""it depends on the person"". This tells me this is behavior he displays selectively, and I guess maybe I didnt do it for him as a personality? He says once he really trusts he lets loose and people would be amazed at how different he is. He is 31, had one gf way back in time and since then not a single interaction with a woman, dating was not even in the picture for him. Focusing on uni, career, status etc. He said he wants to try and form connections with women, develop a bond and have them give him advice, kind of like that feminine motherly figure. Tbh I was feeling he was very behind in basic communication skills or empathy. It seemed like those things never occurred for him and he was trying to learn it all now. I tried to be empathetic, understanding, help him open up, be there, and even though we had some moments of vulnerability and connection, the whole thing between us felt doomed af beyond repair.

I was sensing he liked me or at the very least grew to have some affinity towards me, somewhere between friendship and something more, but perhaps never enough to do anything about it. It's fine, I was enjoying even the fact that i had him in my life. He would make witty jokes, tease me, but never make any sort of advance. He would give compliments about ideas or things but never directed towards me as a woman to make it obvious he's taking interest in me. He would turn any of my hints or clues into jokes, laugh and brush it off.

As time was passing my feelings began intensifying, to the point of putting me on chokehold. I was  tormented with the intensity of what I felt and the overthinking on what to do about it was paralysing me. From nonsense friendly interactions to checking my phone whether he texted, fantasizing about him, thinking of spending more time together... But i also knew that all this may not mean shit to him... that I could just be a texting buddy for when he's bored and nothing more. Or that even if he did feel something, he is so blocked that it's impossible he would do anything to progress things. Feelings are very unexplored territory for him, he told me he doesnt do cute stuff. I could have the patience for someone i genuinely care for if i knew they needed more time to connect. Βut if they genuinely dont have it in them???? It's beyond repair...

I decided to withdraw and pull my energy back cuz i felt so strongly about someone whom I genuinely didnt know how they felt... it started becoming a burden. He would say once in a blue moon that he appreciates my presence in his life and that he feels lucky to have me but wouldn't really see or acknowledge my feelings (or his own). He gets particularly sentimental only about specific topics that would strike a nerve, but other than that an impossible shell to break. I felt like being on a talent show and him being on the judging board and looking at me with a stoic, straight, expressionless face. Nothing moves him or impresses him. Almost felt like he hates me deep down and he's just tolerating me. Tbh being a woman, I do receive attention from men, and whether genuine or not, they all treat me very kindly and warmly in their approach. To put it simply I receive attention that's effortless, getting offers for hangouts, dates, activities... he's the only person ive encountered who is this cold and insensitive. It seems abnormal to me, and tbh, not worth it of giving him the time of day. And even if they did feel the same, it's so complicated and unlikely that it would lead to anything... My enthusiasm, warmth, softness and companionship was probably not well-received... it was probably viewed as annoyance and irritation for him... suffocating him by doing too much. I never reached out again, and he just simply let it die out. No effort to reach out, check on me, ask if something's wrong... Zero interest. It baffles me. Casual, unbothered. 2-3 weeks of not talking and today he removed me from socials, unfriended, unfollowed.

We made plans earlier in May to go on a trip and spend time together during the summer (he suggested it) telling me if I ever come by his city pastries and coffee are his treat. Do you think he's a desensitised psycho or just removed me to regain control over his feelings? (assuming it affected him/meant something to begin with). Isn't it a bit crazy ""punishing"" someone because they wont accept your breadcrumbs? What drives me mad is that he implied he can be great if he chooses to, or jokingly saying ""depends"" who he gives hell to upon interaction... I cant help but think he just didnt like me enough. Im sure he must have had some minimum level of warmth or emotion for his ex, but didnt have it in him to try with me? I am very saddened by all this, but it's probably for the better i walked away and that it didnt lead anywhere.

I (33F) just work part-time here and there between a dental office and a family friend's coffee stand because we don't want to put our kids in daycare it's crazy expensive and just doesn't make sense. And my husband (39M) works full time. We are doing okay financially considering the state of things here in the US right now. 

But I really am getting tired of listening to my husband complain about his job and all of the things that they're not doing and how he hates it and sick of it. 

I totally get it it sucks and he's been with this company for over 12 years. But for the last 3 years since he got this big promotion it has been nothing but constant complaint and I just keep mentioning that maybe he should get his resume together and just see what else is out there. What's the harm?

I even know that his therapist has mentioned this to him as he told me it was mentioned to him in a therapy session. 

I have tried looking for jobs where I would work full-time but we would be completely opposite schedule and asked him if he's okay with this and he's not he says we would never see each other and it'll just make things more stressful. Which we wouldn't see each other besides the weekends. And let's face it we all understand how exhausting and damaging that can be sometimes.

But listening to someone be stressed and overwhelmed about money and all of these things, makes me feel like I need to help solve the problem because we're supposed to be a team. It's getting to the point where I'm looking for jobs that will work with his work schedule and bump up my hourly pay. But what I'm looking for is really kind of scarce. I try to pick up shifts here and there when the stand needs me. I feel like he hasn't bothered to try to see what else might be out there maybe there's better opportunity but it's starting to feel like maybe he doesn't think he deserves better or will find better..

And I just don't know what to do  or how to be more supportive? We really have cut back our spending we haven't been on vacation in a few years it's very tight ship spending and making sure we're very much living within our means. 

I don't really know what I'm asking for maybe I'm just venting...

Now what?","Hey reddit, I need some help and advice. Sorry this is gonna be a long post…

For context: My (27M) husband and I (26F) have been married for about a year. He is from the US (Portland) and I’m from Greece. We met at university in the UK 4 years ago. After 6 months together, I finished school and went back to Greece to work, so we started doing long distance and that went on for 3 years. He eventually also finished school and moved back to the US. For a while, immigration made it hard for us to close the distance, but we still made our relationship work and everything seemed perfect. It’s only recently that we moved together to Portland after getting married and going through all the paperwork for me to be able to come to the US. I’ll be honest, it hasn’t been an easy decision for me to leave my country and my family behind. Portland is far from home, cold and grey, and I don’t have any friends there or many job opportunities (I worked had a good job in my country and was doing pretty good for myself, but it’s not easily transferable to the US). So the first few months have been rough. I’m actively looking for jobs but haven’t got much luck yet, which means that for the first time ever, I’m fully relying on my husband financially. He, on the other hand, works a lot, which often leaves me feeling a bit lonely. Despite all of this, I’m doing my best to make it work. I’ve started going to dance classes and I’ve joined online groups to try and make friends. Until recently, I was resolute to rebuild a life there with him.

Now the heart of the problem: My husband dated this girl, Alison, for years when he was younger. They’re both from Portland and she moved back there a couple of years ago after going away for college. She was his first girlfriend and first love - think high school sweethearts. For the longest time, he seemed to hate talking about her. The only information I had about this first relationship was that they separated before he moved to the UK for school, so a little over a year before he met me. He said that him moving away was a good opportunity for them to experience not being together after all these years of dating, but he never mentioned who brought it up or said anything about how he felt about the break-up. I didn’t think much of it at first (everyone has exes), but overtime I started noticing some things that made me question everything.

It started with me finding little things she gifted my husband over the years (while they were dating) and that he kept: cards, a ring, a personalized cup, etc. Nothing wrong about that, but he was always really quiet and secretive about these objects and about the fact that they were from her. I always ended up finding out they were from her later on, based on a picture or a conversation I’d have with someone from his family. He also had a ton of pictures of her on his computer and on his social media. That bothered me a bit more, because a lot of them were very personal: like a picture of her on her birthday with a very cute caption “happy birthday to the love of my life, most beautiful girl ever” and a bunch of others along these lines. I get keeping pictures as memories of when you were young, but social media is a bit different because it’s a public platform and all of our friends and family can see these posts too. I find that a bit embarrassing, but I guess it’s very much a personal take. My main issue with the whole thing, for the longest time, was that my husband didn’t want to post a single picture of us online, even though we had a lot of photos from vacations together and occasional visits to each other. I even asked him if I could post us on my social media instead, but he said he wasn’t comfortable with it either. I respected his wish at the time, because I thought he just wanted to limit his online presence and not showcase our relationship for everybody to see.

About a year and a half into our relationship though, I decided to bring the ex-girlfriend up anyways because I was worried he might not be completely over her, and I always prefer to get these potential issues out of the way early on. We had a long talk about it and he was very reassuring. He said he was not in touch with her and that he was over her, but still cared about her and didn’t want to delete her pictures from his social media because ""it wouldn’t be nice"". I asked him if she ever texted him, would he want to meet up with her to catch up. He said no, he wasn’t interested in ever seeing her again or even being friends with her. He also said that, because they were together for so long, she was tied to a lot of his memories and it was hard to dissociate her from his past. I thought it was a pretty reasonable explanation. I told him about my exes too, how I was not in touch with any of them and would tell him if they ever reached out to me (they never did). I also explained that I’m the type of person who cuts all ties with their exes, and that I don’t understand people who stay friends with their exes. He seemed to understand my position. After that discussion, I felt a lot better and I felt like I understood his reasons better. He ended up keeping the pictures of her on his social media and on his computer, and I never brought it up again for years, because I fully trusted him.

Our big fallout happened while we were traveling to my home country to see my family last year. We had been married for 6 months, together for almost 4 years. When we landed in Athens, my phone couldn’t get signal on the runaway, so I asked my husband if I could use his to text my cousin – who was picking us up – to let her know we had landed (my husband couldn’t text her himself because he doesn’t speak Greek and she doesn’t speak English). To my horror, I see a very recent conversation with his ex on his phone. I fully freak out in the plane. People must have thought I was crazy. He looked bothered and uncomfortable, and said she just texted him happy new years or something. He even showed me the text, but I was so mad I didn’t even want to look at it at the time. Our conversation was cut short, because we had to deplane and go meet my cousin.

After we got to my parents’ house, we managed to go on a quick walk to talk it out. He apologized and swore he was just occasionally talking to her, for birthdays and Christmases, stuff like that. But according to him, he had never tried to really catch up with her; they were not even really friends and he never tried to meet up with her. I asked why he felt the need to stay in touch after all these years, and he said it was mostly out of habit. He was just being nice and polite to someone he had dated. I asked why he never told me about it and he said he didn’t think that was a big deal; and if he had known it was this important to me, he would have told me. He said he never had the intention of hurting me or cheating on me. For the photos on his social media, he recognized he should have taken them down long ago and he actually took them down the next day, but not without profusely crying (he didn’t delete them, just archived them so they wouldn’t be public anymore). Seeing him so sad made me feel horrible and I felt unreasonable for making him do this.

After that discussion, I tried to forget about the whole thing and move on, but I just couldn’t. I kept replaying our conversations in my head and I realized he never gave me a satisfying reason for why he didn’t tell me about their texting. He said that he didn’t mean to mislead me when he said he was “not touch with her”, but the reality is that he was in fact in touch with her this whole time, and told me otherwise. I was really convinced this entire time that they were not talking and that he had no interest in catching up with her. I also thought of how he was considerate enough of her feelings to avoid deleting her pictures off his social media, even though they’re broken off, but he wasn’t considerate of mine, even after I said I wasn’t super comfortable with these pictures being there. Again, not asking him to delete them forever, just not have them out there for everyone to see, including myself.

A few days after our talk, I started really spiralling, and I ended up checking his phone. I had never done this before, in our 4 years of dating and I feel so much shame and guilt for having done this. I just had this uneasy feeling that wouldn’t go away and I needed to be sure. For the first time, I realized that he might be capable of looking at me straight in the eyes and tell a very convincing lie. And I would believe it. So I looked. And it was everything that I was afraid of. Not only had he been talking to her our entire relationship, without ever telling me, but it was more than just birthdays and Christmases. He congratulated her on a new job, she sent him pictures of her new cats, and they were exchanging news about their respective families. And this entire time, not a single mention of me. He never said he was dating me or that he was married. The only time I came up in their conversation was because he posted our engagement pictures on social media (that’s our first picture together on his social media btw); she saw it and congratulated him. Worst of all: he actually tried to meet up with her twice during the first 2 years of our relationship. The first time, he invited her for an online coffee, and later on he asked her out for actual coffee, while he was on a trip back home to Portland from the UK. She didn’t respond to him and I have no clue if they actually met up, but this still broke my heart. At the time of that exchange between them, my husband and I were not yet married and we were still doing long distance. We had not seen each other for a long time, and I was eagerly waiting for him to come and see me in Greece after his return from the US. He never once said he was thinking of meeting up with his ex, never gave me a chance to say whether or not I was ok with it. 

To make it clear, I would be fine with him having a neutral platonic relationship with his ex, texting from time to time and staying in touch. The issue is that he was never honest and transparent about wanting to do it. He did everything to prevent me from finding out he was still talking to her and trying to see her. I think this shows hill intentions, even if it’s unconscious. I’m afraid that deep down, he never really got over her and can’t fully let go of her, even though it might hurt our relationship. I think he was afraid I wouldn’t be ok with them texting/meeting up, so he choose to keep it from me rather than risking having to let her go. 

Now I don’t know what to do. I feel like I’ve uprooted my life for someone who has not been putting me first and that I’m not even sure I can fully trust. It’s horrible because I used to completely trust him and would never have a doubt about what he said. But now, I’m questioning everything. What do you think Reddit? I’m seriously thinking of giving him an ultimatum and ask he cuts all ties with her, or our relationship won't survive, but how can I even be sure he will actually do it?

While working at a coffee shop, a regular customer recommended teaching conversational English to international adults. It was fun to get paid to have conversations with interesting people and help them with their communication skills.  Eventually I became a Trainer and dabbled in Curriculum Development. 

Working at language institutes was fun, but there was zero benefits and not enough stability; two of the institutes closed their doors for good. 

When I lost my job at a university foreign language center, I leveraged my foodservice experience and got a different job at the same university. It’s more stable and the benefits are good. Currently, I train and supervise college student employees in a coffee & sandwich shop at a large public university. I’m getting too old to be on my feet 8-10 hours a day and am bored & burnt out too. I want to earn more money. Who doesn’t? 

I need a change. What’s a new job that pays $30/ hr or more, is mentally stimulating, involves people, and creativity? What are your thoughts on these ideas? I get free tuition and am willing to go back to school.

My parents are not supportive - they have an abusive marriage themselves and believe that I should not have left my abusive husband because I now bring shame to my family for being divorced. I have no other family. My friends have moved on with their own married lives.

Anyway, in this place I’m renting, there is this nice muslim male building manager who has been very emotionally supportive. We are the same age. He has extended his personal phone number which I accepted because I thought it was for extra security so I didn’t mind. He said I can talk to him any time I need a chat. We have never had a phone call, only in person chats and messages. When I started to feel confused is when he asked me for my Snapchat after we had a few conversations in person. I gave it anyway - it’s been months and there haven’t been any inappropriate photos exchanged. This is where the majority of our communication takes place. I save most of our chats and he can see that. We never speak inappropriately or sexually. He uses it to make sure I am doing okay and to check in on me. He does use red love heart emojis sometimes which I was surprised by, but I thought, maybe he is just being really kind. Sometimes we chat about random things like religion, work and life during and outside of his working hours. I wonder if he does all this because he feels sorry for me. He did ask me out to coffee once but I declined it out of guilt and respect for his wife. His response was very respectful “that’s absolutely fine, whatever you are comfortable with.” I asked him if his wife would be ok with us going out and he replied “my wife trusts that I would never do anything to hurt her. You can meet her if you want.” He’s never arranged for us to meet. To this day I have never gone out with him because I’d feel really bad doing that, or is this a normal thing people do these days? I wouldn’t anyway, ever. I don’t even go out with male colleagues. 

Also, he has some very young babies so I don’t know how his wife would have time to meet me.. a random female tenant? I have asked him thoughts his thoughts on marriage because I feel scared about marriage. He said marriage is really good with his wife. He said he looks forward to going home to his babies. Marriage is good when it’s with the right person he says. 

I know his wife definitely knows of my existence because I’ve sent food for him to take home during Ramadan as a nice gesture and she’s sent something back. But nothing deeper than that with her. Don’t know what she looks like and I don’t think she knows me properly either, but I have no idea. He has given me gifts and cuddly things to put a smile on my face. Not sure if his wife knows about this and I am scared to ask him. 

He is the highlight of my life at the moment, very protective, kind and caring. I’ve never had a male presence like this. It warms my heart and I think he sees that and likes it. We have a close bond that keeps me going in life. I feel supported and cherished for once. But I of course know that he has a family of his own and I would never want to interfere with that. 

I feel guilty and scared that I might be doing something wrong? I am scared to address it in case he has pure intentions, I don’t want to make it become inappropriate or weird. Am I overthinking and he just sees me as someone to support? Does he see me as a daughter? A Muslim sister in need? Do married men just help women and it’s normal? I do worry that I see things as more than they are simply because I am not used to being treated well especially by a man. 

I’ve been confused about this situation and I would love to hear people’s thoughts. ",0,1749504798.0,MuslimMarriage,14,0.33,False

I feel like lately there are people going WAY too deep into engine types, engine maintenance records, preflight issues, etc. Truthfully people are bringing up stuff that no pilot on the line would most likely see in their logs.  

1. Please remember as you go down your rabbit holes that creators and content providers on the internet make money by keeping people engaged.  They do this by instilling fear and anger.  This isn’t the world showing you a sign, this is the algorithm taking you deeper and keeping you occupied.  If you feel a strong emotion, please take a step back and reevaluate. 

2. On the same topic, if there is a creator speaking about the dangers of a certain engine or a certain plane, just understand… if they know about it, so does the FAA/Company, Maintenance/Manufacturer.  If it wasn’t fixed it wouldn’t be flying. Period.

3. Preflight inspections happen prior to EVERY flight.  We fly in the same plane as you and take your safety, as well as our own, very seriously.  Remember if we get home, you get home.  If you see a pilot walking around outside, that is normal, safe, and by policy. 

4. We have insanely talented and knowledgeable maintenance staff working on every component of the airplane.  If the pilot says there is a delay for maintenance, that is the system working.  One of the MANY people who look at the plane found something defective.  We have lists of things we are allowed to fly without on a deferral and that is certified by the FAA to do so. If the item can’t be fixed or if it is a safety issue, you won’t take off.  Period.  Also, the maintenance could be as simple as the coffee maker leaking. 

5. If you find yourself looking a historical maintenance logs of an airplane, you are literally trying to find something to be afraid about.  It takes a lot of work to go that deep to delve into topics most of the world aren’t trained on.  Please trust us that we have your safety in mind.  

6. Every aircraft flying is safe.  Truly, most of the time I am flying in the back, I don’t know what me or my family is flying on because it is that inconsequential.  Also trying to plan the exact plane and tail number prior to your flight is a lost cause.  Sometimes between the time I park in the employee lot and the time I get through security they have made 2-3 changes. 

Hopefully this doesn’t ruffle feathers, but this seems to be a common theme recently and I felt it should be addressed. 

I understand research can make the unknown,known and the scary, less scary.  But I have seen so many people become their own worst enemies and get into the “fear rabbit hole.”",10,1749504397.0,fearofflying,4,1.0,False

I'm not against healthy eating but man, it seems like the scrupulosity vacuum has been filled by this stuff. Makes me kind of worry that they'll keep pushing the envelope and do some risky diets in the future.

My Dad was an *amazing* man. He was the coolest person in the *world*. 

Known as our town’s superhero, he used his newfound powers to bring down evil villains who threatened to take over. 

Nobody knew how he and a number of others acquired their abilities. 

There were rumours of a chemical explosion in the powerplant. 

Some people even believed my Dad was from a different planet, while others were convinced it was natural human evolution. My Dad could shoot lasers out of his eyes, and he was *super* strong. 

When I was seven years old, he single-handedly stopped The Cerebral Drainer, a psychopath with a vacuum like power who took the lives of ten innocent people, sucking out their brains in broad daylight. 

Dad saved a child live on local TV, swooping down from the sky and telling the panicking crowd *everything is going to be okay*. Then when I was twelve, Dad took down Rat Face, a villain who filled the streets with disease ridden rodents. 

My Dad was our town’s superhero, and in exchange for keeping his secret from the rest of the world, he protected all of us. 

He was the best superhero (and father) by day, and family-man and loving husband by night. I was Millie Myers, a completely ordinary high school girl, and daughter of *Star-man*. 

It wasn't out of the ordinary for the press to be swarming our door when I got home from school.

Pushing through the crowd of my Dad’s adoring fans, I flashed my *perfect* smile at the cameras. 

As Star-man’s daughter, I was yet to reveal my power to the town. 

I could tell they were gunning for it, their wide and frenzied eyes raking me up and down. 

The older I was getting, the less patient the town was. Dad told them in a press conference that I was just a *late bloomer*. Channel 7 news was waiting for me at our front door, immediately sticking a microphone in my face. I was told not to talk to the press. I was tired, and the cameras were hurting my eyes. 

The anchorwoman, Heather Carlisle, was already yelling in my face. 

“Millie Myers! Is it true your father is currently interrogating the son of the infamous villain, Six-Eyes?”

Six Eyes was the opposite of my father. 

Dad strived to protect our town and everyone in it. 

Six Eyes, who was famous for the mutation that came with his ability, sought to destroy it. It was almost a year since he had brainwashed the Mayor and almost taken control of our tiny town. 

Dad did manage to apprehend him, only for Six Eyes to break out of prison two weeks later. 

His eighteen year old son, Cartwright, wanted nothing to do with him. He had even legally changed his name to get as far away from his father as possible.

The boy was only in town for a few weeks, on vacation from college. 

However, over the last few days, my father had reasons to believe Six-Eyes was in contact with his estranged son. 

So, he planned to question the kid on his Dad’s whereabouts. 

I twisted around, maintaining a wide smile. “No comment.” I told the cameras. 

The anchorwoman nodded slowly, thrusting her microphone further into my face. I had to hold back a sneeze. “*But* your father is interrogating him *now*, correct? Millie, can you tell us what… techniques he is using?” She demanded, her expression riddled with excitement.

She was trying to get me to spill or trip over what I was saying so my words could be taken out of context.

But I was already heavily media trained not to say a thing. I couldn't say the same for when I was a little younger. 

I blindly told the press a *lot* of things I regret. 

Dad didn't get mad easily, but his smile did start to slightly falter when I told Channel 7 our family's business. 

Shutting the press down, I shook my head, making sure to stretch my lips into a big, cheesy grin. Just like my Dad told me. I cleared my throat. 

“Rest assured, Cartwright is in good hands, I can promise you all that.” 

I nodded at the crowd, making direct eye contact with each of them. Dad said if I wanted the crowd to believe my earnest words, I had to look into each and every eye, and *mean it*. That's what I did.

“As we all know, the son of Six Eyes is *not* a bad person, and we should not blame him for his father’s crimes. I cannot speak for my Dad, but I can *assure* you, he *will* find the villain Six Eyes.”

I held my breath, pausing for just enough time for the crowd to register my words. 

“And bring him to justice.”

When I turned to open my door, the spell was broken, more questions thrown at me. 

“Millie, is it true you have not inherited your father’s abilities?” 

Someone else screamed in my face, and I choked down a yell. 

“Millie Myers, can you tell us more about your father’s interrogation?!” 

I shrugged. “I don't know. He's just talking to him.”

“Millie!” A wide eyed redhead followed me, stumbling over my mother’s rose garden. 

When he carelessly stamped on a blooming rose, I resisted the urge to shove him back. He looked like an ammateur, a college kid, maybe, armed with just his iPhone and a dream. 

The guy got close. 

Too close for comfort, swiping at my jacket. 

His breath was just coffee and cigarettes. “Are you aware of the photos floating around of you and Kai Hendrix, the son of Oculus? Can you confirm that you are in a relationship?”

A younger woman threw herself in front of him. 

“Miss Myers, is there a reason why your brother does not come outside–”

Ignoring them, I opened the door, stepped inside our house, and slammed it behind me. Once inside, I let myself breathe, dropping my backpack and pulling off my jacket. There was a folded square of paper tucked into my pocket. 

I pulled it out and ripped it into pieces. There were exactly 1,370 tally marks carved into our front door. With a rusty nail, I scratched another tally, crossing a group of four. *1,371 days.*

Kicking off my shoes, I strode into the downstairs living room. 

“I'm home.” I told my twin brother. 

Ethan Myers was born three minutes after me. We weren't classed as identical twins, but Mom was convinced we were. 

Both of us had thick brown hair, bearing our mother’s soft features. While I kept mine in a  strict ponytail, Ethan’s had grown out lighter and curlier than mine, hanging in dark eyes. Ethan was the Myers twin who *was not* in the town’s spotlight. 

My brother was in his usual place, sitting on the couch, knees pressed to his chest, half lidded eyes glued to the corpse of our TV. The screen had been hollowed out a long time ago.  I skipped into the kitchen and filled a glass of orange juice, took a quick sip, and headed over to my brother, pressing the drink to his lips.

Ethan didn't respond for a moment, before his lazy eyes rolled to me, life erupting into his expression. He gulped it down, juice trickling down his chin. 

When I withdrew the glass, he shot me a grateful smile. I winced when he straightened up, the sound of jingling metal sending me stumbling back. 

“Thanks, Mills.”

He held up his right hand, just like when we were little kids. “High five?” 

I ignored his childlike grin, hollowed out eyes penetrating right through me. 

Ethan was never looking at me. He was always looking over my shoulder. But when I followed his gaze, there was nothing there. I ruffled his hair, resisting the urge to wrap my arms around him.  

But I had to keep my distance. 

I stepped back, my gaze trailing the ceiling. “Where's Dad?”

Ethan’s eyes travelled back to the TV, his lips pricking into a smile. 

“Basement.” He said. “Daddy is interrogating the villain’s son.”

I nodded, pulling my Switch from my bag and dropping it into his lap. 

It used to be Ethan’s. In fact, he had carved his initials into the back. “You can play with this, you know."" I forced out, trying to stop my hands from trembling. 

“You don't have to keep…” I turned to the shattered TV screen, my heart catapulting into my mouth. Ethan didn't look at me, his gaze boring into the TV. 

He didn't respond, so I headed towards the basement door. 

But not before my brother let out a hysterical giggle. 

When I turned to him, Ethan was seventeen years old, laughing at invisible cartoons. 

“Do you expect me to play with no fucking hands?” 

I didn't, or *couldn't*, reply. 

“Hey, Millie?” Ethan hummed, when I pulled open the basement door. 

The chill that followed set my nerve endings on fire. My brother’s voice was deeper, no longer the childish giggle I'd gotten used to. In the corner of my eye, his head turned towards me. Standing on the threshold for a fraction of a second, I think part of me wondered if Ethan’s mind had pieced itself back together.

“Mom wants juice too.” 

My twin’s voice was suddenly so small. “Can you get her some?”

I pretended not to hear him, skipping down to the basement, ignoring how cold each step was, the ingrained red dried into concrete. The *best* part of my day was visiting my father while he was working. I held my breath, easing my way down each step. “Hey, Dad?” I called, easing myself through the dark. 

I always made sure to announce my presence. “Daddy.” I pulled my lips into the biggest, cheesiest smile. “I'm home.”

“Pumpkin!” Dad’s voice echoed from the bottom of the stairs. “How's my favorite girl doing?”

Moving further down the stairs, I could hear screaming. 

Wailing. 

Sobbing. 

There were specific rules I had to abide by when stepping inside the basement. 

I had to be extra quiet if my father was doing *superhero business*. Over the years, though, Dad had relaxed the rules  a little. When I pushed through the plastic sheeting, Daddy had already opened up the boy’s head. It's not like I was surprised. He'd moved away from the interrogation stage a long time ago. 

Star-man stood in a simple suit and tie, a white coat draped over. 

My father was young for his age, dark brown hair and pale features. 

Cartwright didn't look so good, lying on his back, his half lidded gaze glued to the ceiling.

I could see sharp red spilled across the floor and the bed he was strapped to.

Star-man loomed over him, cradling the boy’s jerking head between blood slicked gloves. The closer I got, I could see the exposed meat of the boy’s brain leaking from the pearly white of his skull. 

Closer. 

Cartwright's body was quaking, his wrists straining against velcro straps. 

My father’s fingers gently stroked across the pink of his brain, tiny sparks of electricity bleeding from his index. Star-man's grin widened, and I watched the villain’s son writhing under his touch. 

I could see the tiny sparks of electricity running from Dad’s fingers, forcing his victim into submission. The villain’s son’s eyes rolled back, a wet sounding sob escaping his lips. He was still conscious, and could feel everything. 

Star-man lifted his head, his eyes finding me. 

“Sweetie! How was school?” 

He let go of Cartwright's head, delicately changing his gloves for brand new clinical white ones. “Your teacher called about a certain test you have been trying to avoid.” Dad tutted, swiping his bloody hands on his coat. 

When Cartwright tried to wrench from the bed, he knocked the kid back down with a laugh. “Millie, I *did* say, there will be consequences if you flunk your tests.” 

He gestured for me to come closer with a blood drenched glove, and I did. 

Star-man prodded a single finger into the raw flesh of Cartwright's brain, and the boy screamed, writhing, blood running thick from his nose. “Do I need to take your phone away, hmm? How about the school trip to New York? Millie, I don't *have* to sign the permission slip.” He turned back to the villain’s son, hanging over the boy with a laugh.

“What do you think?” He cleared his throat. 

When Dad nodded at me, I laughed too. “Young Mr Cartwright, the human brain does *not* have nerves, so I don't know why you're screaming. It is quite embarrassing for a boy of your age.”

He slapped the boy’s cheek playfully, and Cartwright wailed. 

1,400 days, I thought, watching my father torture the teenage boy.

1,400 days since Star-man walked into our house, burned down our door, and announced himself as our new father. 

I was thirteen years old in middle school. 

Ethan and I were watching TV in the living room, and there he was. 

Star-man, with his signature grin, standing between the melted remnants of our front door.

Stella, our little sister, squeaked in delight. 

“Star-man!” She jumped off of the couch. 

Ethan gently dragged her back, holding her to his chest. 

“Hey, Mom?” He yelled, his voice shaking. 

“There's someone at the door.”

Star-man chuckled, taking a step inside our hallway. 

“Oh, no, I'm not here for your mother.”

1,400 days since he murdered our mother, lasering her head cleanly from her shoulders when she threw herself in front of us and begged him to take her. 

There was wet warmth running across the concrete floor. I barely noticed, hopping over it. 

1,400 days since Star-man burned our little sister alive in front of our eyes. 

Star-man didn't *want* three children. 

He wanted two. 

1,400 days since our father nailed wooden planks over the door, announcing Ethan and I as his legacies. 

Ethan started to spiral. He tried to escape out his bedroom window, and then more dangerously, jumping off of the roof of our house, and that just made our father angry. He burned a hole in the TV, and then hollowed out the screen. 

Star-man just wanted a son and a daughter. That's what he told my brother. 

He could not procreate because of the mutation causing his ability. But he had always wanted *children*. 

Star-man promised us he was going to be the best father anyone would ask for. 

And he *was*. 

100 days after murdering our mother and sister, Ethan and I were plunged into the town’s spotlight. 

*“These are my children!”* Star-man told a crowd of flashing cameras. 

He wrapped his arms around the two of us, pulling us closer. 

*“Ladies and gentlemen, I would like you to meet Millie and Ethan Myers from my first marriage.”

Star-man addressed the crowd with earnest eyes. 

“I know what you're thinking, and no, these two are *little rascals*,” he ruffled our hair a little too hard, and I made sure to laugh and smile and *not* cry. “Millie and Ethan do not share my abilities.” 

His lips spread into a grin. 

*“Yet.”*

That word had been hanging over me since the press-conference. 

*Yet*. 

Presently, Dad was crawling in my head again. 

*Smile, Millie!*. 

I did, smiling so much, blood pooled from my lips. 

Dad promised neither of us would be sad again. We wouldn't fear him or anything else. In fact, we were going to be happy, smiling, perfect children forever, his shining legacies he would dangle in front of the town on our eighteenth birthday. 

It was his birthday present to us, and I was *so* excited.

The closer I was getting to my father, I could sense him fashioning my smile, wider and wider, until I couldn't breathe. 

He didn't care that I was bleeding. 

That my eyes were stinging. 

All he cared about was that I loved him as my father. 

“Come here, Millie.” 

I forced myself forwards, swallowing vomit filling the back of my mouth. 

If I screamed, I would end up like my brother. Ethan was on a permanent time out until his 18th birthday. Star-man was yet to forgive my twin trying to stab him at Thanksgiving dinner. Dad said Ethan’s mental state was *puberty*, but I was more akin to believing it was a mixture of trauma, as well as our father’s attempt to poison my brother with powers at fourteen years old which almost killed him. Dad was smart enough to stop the procedure before he killed his only son. 

I blinked, my legs buckling, footsteps faltering. 

Sometimes I think I can pull away from his influence. 

“Millie Myers.” Dad hummed, skimming his finger across a variety of scalpels. Cartwright watched him feverishly. “Don't make me ask again, Pumpkiiiiin.”

Still.

I felt my thoughts start to melt away, replaced with artificial happiness choking me. Our father was the *best* Dad in the whole world. I wouldn't ask for any other father, and I didn't even miss my mother! 

With that thought slamming into me, I skipped over to my father with a grin. 

Around him were rejects, corpses piled to the ceiling, limbs and heads and torso’s contorted and merged into one mass of gore. 

Human’s he attempted to turn into minions. 

But there were also *successful* villains. 

The Cerebral Drainer, and Rat Face had been ripped apart and put back together again. Dad was saving them for a quiet day. The Myers basement was my father’s workshop. When I joined his side, he ran his fingers over Cartwright's skull. 

I was surprised when the villain’s son let out a sudden, hysterical giggle, his eyes rolling to pearly whites. “What are you doing to him?” I asked, intrigued, running my hands over the boy’s restraints. This time, Cartwright's body contorted into an arch, maniacal laughter escaping his lips. 

When his back slammed into metal, the ground rumbled. 

“Now, what is funny, hmm?” Star-man asked in a low hum.

The boy responded by spitting in his face, shrieking with giggles. 

Dad cleared his throat, swiping blood from his cheek. 

“That's not funny.”

I was keenly aware of several instruments dangling above my head. 

Cartwright's body jolted, and they hit the ground. 

Dad turned his attention to me. “What is your nightmare of a brother doing, young lady?” 

His words shattered part of his influence. 

I felt my breath start to quicken, my heart starting to pound.

*Fear*. 

Ethan hadn't moved in days, weeks, months. 

Glued to that one seat, caught inside his own delusion. 

Ethan was watching TV when Mom’s brains were splattered across the walls. 

He was watching TV when our little sister’s flesh bubbled into the living room carpet. 

“Ethan is watching TV.” I hummed, “What are you doing to the villain’s son?” I pointed to the boy’s contorting fingers. They turned clockwise, straining under harsh velcro straps.

Cartwright was trying to twist off my head like a bottletop. I was lucky to have my father’s protection. 

Dad shot me a grin. “Well, you see, Millie.” He said, shoving the hysterical boy back onto the bed. Madness. I saw it in his eyes, igniting every part of his face, running through his nerve endings. 

That is what made a villain, what we all saw on the local news. 

It was the loss of humanity, logic quite literally burned from the brain stem.

Complete, unbridled euphoria, accepting insanity. 

I had already seen this exact look. 

The Cerebral Drainer’s psychotic grin. 

Rat Face’s all too familiar and horrific chittering laugh. 

Six Eyes’s Alice In Wonderland smile. 

Dad rocked the boy’s head back and forth. Cartwright giggled along, his gaze finding nothing, penetrating nothing. His hands went limp, and he gave up trying to yank my brain from my skull. “We can't have *heroes* without villains, can we?”

I reached out, poking the boy in the face.

“So, he's like his father?”

Dad almost looked like a proud father. “Oh, no, honey, he's *better* than his father. He's already setting an example.” Starman nudged me playfully. “Your father would not exist without the bad guys,” he said, tracing a finger over the boy’s cheek. “We’re just lucky we have a town full of naive fuck-wits.” 

Cartwright laughed *harder*. Hard enough to send him toppling off of the bed with a wet, meaty sounding smack. 

I was partially aware of my body reacting. My breaths quickened, a thick slime creeping up my throat. I think I stepped back. I think I almost screamed.

I forgot his head was hanging open, half of his brains leaking out. 

But I don't think Cartwright *needed* a brain anymore. 

Whatever was left of it was blackened, thick, poisoned streaks running up down what had been healthy pink and grey. 

My Dad scooped him up, and plonked him back onto ice cold steel. 

His evil laugh was fake, manufactured, programmed directly into his mind. 

Part of me wondered if this was his father’s fate too. 

Six Eyes. 

Was *he* a result of my father’s experiments?

The crazy thing is, the more I want to scream, my chest heaving, fear starting to gnaw away at me, the stronger my father’s influence is. The villain’s son was stitched back up with not even a hair out of place and thrown into the back with the other finished minions.

If he recovered well, Cartwright, son of Six Eyes, would be going on a town rampage very soon. 

Well, he *was* the villain’s son after all. 

Instead of screaming, I smiled. 

Dad taught me everything about cutting up humans. Human brains were so *easy* to manipulate. 

Because humans were bad. 

The people like my Dad were better. 

I grabbed a scalpel, sticking it into Cartwright's hand. 

His whimper of pain collapsing into hysterical laughter didn't give me hope. 

If he reacted positively to a blade going through his skin, he wasn't worth saving. 

Once that thought crossed my mind, however, I REALLY LOVED MY DAD. 

The mental declaration almost sent me to my knees. 

“Go upstairs and do your homework.” Dad said, wheeling Cartwright into the back room. “I'll be upstairs to cook dinner in ten minutes.”

“Sure, dad.”

His influence was like a wire wrapped around my throat.

Squeezing. 

“Oh, and Millie?”

I didn't turn around. “Yes?”

“Chocolate or strawberry for your birthday cake?”

I froze, my smile stretching right across my face. 

He knew my answer. Dad baked us a cake 4 hours after I trashed the slimy remnants of my little sister. Star-man forced me to *peel* my sister from the carpet and dump her in a trash bag.

I could still smell her charred flesh hanging in the air. 

Star-man made a giant chocolate cake and frosting. 

He made us eat every single morsel. 

Every bite was agonising. 

“Chocolate, Daddy.” I said, swallowing my lunch. 

Dad chuckled, and somewhere in the back, Cartwright started laughing. 

Starting as quiet giggles, they became full on guffaws. 

Star-man ignored him. 

“That's right, Princess.”

I nodded, heading back up the stairs. 

Greeting my brother, I cranked the Alexa to full volume. 

I always listen to music when I'm doing my homework. 

Filling a glass of water, I held it to Ethan’s lips with *three* fingers. 

Ethan downed it in *three* gulps, and then nodded in one single motion. 

Star-man may be a highly intelligent psychopath, but he is yet to notice my brother is not as brain dead as he thinks. 

Yes, he still watches TV. 

But he's also *thinking*.

Dad is under the impression my twin doesn't need to be under his control. 

But Ethan has been planning. 

And slowly, over days, weeks, months, he has been putting together our escape plan. 

It has been 1,400 days since Ethan and I tried to escape our father. 

1,370 days since we started to scratch our days of captivity into the door. 

10 days until we turn eighteen.

He seems hella self-aware about it and he even says ""it depends on the person"". This tells me this is behavior he displays selectively, and I guess maybe I didnt do it for him as a personality? He says once he really trusts he lets loose and people would be amazed at how different he is. He is 31, had one gf way back in time and since then not a single interaction with a woman, dating was not even in the picture for him. Focusing on uni, career, status etc. He said he wants to try and form connections with women, develop a bond and have them give him advice, kind of like that feminine motherly figure. Tbh I was feeling he was very behind in basic communication skills or empathy. It seemed like those things never occurred for him and he was trying to learn it all now. I tried to be empathetic, understanding, help him open up, be there, and even though we had some moments of vulnerability and connection, the whole thing between us felt doomed af beyond repair.

I was sensing he liked me or at the very least grew to have some affinity towards me, somewhere between friendship and something more, but perhaps never enough to do anything about it. It's fine, I was enjoying even the fact that i had him in my life. He would make witty jokes, tease me, but never make any sort of advance. He would give compliments about ideas or things but never directed towards me as a woman to make it obvious he's taking interest in me. He would turn any of my hints or clues into jokes, laugh and brush it off.

As time was passing my feelings began intensifying, to the point of putting me on chokehold. I was  tormented with the intensity of what I felt and the overthinking on what to do about it was paralysing me. From nonsense friendly interactions to checking my phone whether he texted, fantasizing about him, thinking of spending more time together... But i also knew that all this may not mean shit to him... that I could just be a texting buddy for when he's bored and nothing more. Or that even if he did feel something, he is so blocked that it's impossible he would do anything to progress things. Feelings are very unexplored territory for him, he told me he doesnt do cute stuff. I could have the patience for someone i genuinely care for if i knew they needed more time to connect. Βut if they genuinely dont have it in them???? It's beyond repair...

I decided to withdraw and pull my energy back cuz i felt so strongly about someone whom I genuinely didnt know how they felt... it started becoming a burden. He would say once in a blue moon that he appreciates my presence in his life and that he feels lucky to have me but wouldn't really see or acknowledge my feelings (or his own).  He gets particularly sentimental only about specific topics that would strike a nerve, but other than that an impossible shell to break. I felt like being on a talent show and him being on the judging board and looking at me with a stoic, straight, expressionless face. Nothing moves him or impresses him. Almost felt like he hates me deep down and he's just tolerating me. Tbh being a woman, I do receive attention from men, and whether genuine or not, they all treat me very kindly and warmly in their approach. To put it simply I receive attention that's effortless, getting offers for hangouts, dates, activities... he's the only person ive encountered who is this cold and insensitive. It seems abnormal to me, and tbh, not worth it of giving him the time of day. And even if they did feel the same, it's so complicated and unlikely that it would lead to anything... My enthusiasm, warmth, softness and companionship was probably not well-received... it was probably viewed as annoyance and irritation for him... suffocating him by doing too much. I never reached out again, and he just simply let it die out. No effort to reach out, check on me, ask if something's wrong... Zero interest. It baffles me. Casual, unbothered. 2-3 weeks of not talking and today he removed me from socials, unfriended, unfollowed.

We made plans earlier in May to go on a trip and spend time together during the summer (he suggested it) telling me if I ever come by his city pastries and coffee are his treat. Do you think he's a desensitised psycho or just removed me to regain control over his feelings? (assuming it affected him to begin with). Isn't it a bit crazy ""punishing"" someone because they wont accept your breadcrumbs? What drives me mad is that he implied he can be great if he chooses to, or jokingly saying ""depends"" who he gives hell to upon interaction... I cant help but think he just didnt like me enough. Im sure he must have had some minimum level of warmth or emotion for his ex, but didnt have it in him to try with me? I am very saddened by all this, but it's probably for the better i walked away and that it didnt lead anywhere.

Hi there! I’m a lesbian the wrong side of 30 based in FL. What I’m looking for is pretty simple (at least I think), I just want to find someone I can chat with and maybe flirt and then see where it goes.

I’d love if you put a little effort in your first message. Start with your age and location (name or what you would like me to call you would be a bonus) and maybe what made you reach out. I can be a little awkward but I’m sure together we can have a fun conversation!

Some things about me and what I like. Like so many of us, I’m obsessed with murder podcasts (but who isn’t?), I like kayaking, going out for coffee, cooking, weightlifting and animals (maybe tell me a fun animal fact or your fave animal?) i am also down to talk about some dirty things if you would like to - at least get to know me a little though first!

Anyway, I hope some of you are brave enough to slide into my DM’s!

I see someone else posted about this book nook 4 months ago but I wanted to add some info.  This is the Acemend-branded Coffee Garden House book nook I bought on Amazon.

Overall I give this nook a 9.5/10 score.  It was challenging but fun, and I love how it looks even though I forgot to attach the sign and install the interior hanging faux-light (printed) before I took the pictures.  :)

I won't list this as a con but there is a lot of gluing.  A lot.  Some of the pieces are tiny and it's really challenging to get them glued on straight.  This was the first time I had worked with florals, and putting them in bead ""vases"" was definitely not easy!  To build the clear bakery case you have to attach the middle shelf with no supports or guides, I can't believe I got it into place without having big smears of glue on the sides of the case.  I swore only one time.  :)  This is my 4th nook and I'm glad I didn't try this one earlier, it really utilized all of my skills and experience and I was forced to develop new skills.

I did not attach the exterior hinged window because I'll be using this as a nook between cookbooks in my kitchen.  In case anyone wonders, the window isn't actually an open area, there's a plastic sheet on that entire wall.  I also did not attach the CD shelf that was supposed to be installed below the radio because I would be gluing it to the window where there was no framing and that didn't seem right to me.  :)

cons:

* there is no door or permanent opening (when I bought the kit I thought the front arched area was open)
* the front is super plain but I think it could be easily dressed up with some florals or paint or patterned paper
* some instructions are not clear, a few steps are missing, and at times the illustrations show items that aren't added until later; an experienced nook-builder won't have trouble but a novice might
* some instructions are badly-ordered, like they tell you to put on a side wall before all of the tiny accessories are in place inside, or they tell you to put the roof on and wire it for lighting before you install the staircase railing
* there are a lot of spare parts and they aren't marked in red as they are in the CuteBee kits
* there wasn't enough greenery

pros:

* packaging was excellent
* all components were printed well, many on both sides, and I was able to push out all of the parts without any breakage
* the kit includes bent tweezers, small scissors, and enough B-7000 glue (10ml) to complete the project

advice:

* have some extra flowers and greenery available so you can be generous
* read ahead a page or two so you see what's coming up and alter the order of assembly if necessary
* consult the flower and vase chart at the beginning of the instructions to make sure you are using the correct parts

Personal taste note: I like hard, super creamy & dense ice cream, ideally with a bit of a chew. I also tend to like smooth flavors without a lot of mix ins, though I’ll make exceptions.

Day 1: Amy’s @ the Austin airport. This one wasn’t new to me, but it’s definitely a favorite. I got Belgian Chocolate and Smoky Sichuan. Amy’s Belgian Chocolate is one of my favorite chocolates because it has none of the grainy bitterness you can sometimes get. The Sichuan was new to me. It wasn’t spicy at all, which was a surprise— more like a sweet cream but with more depth and complexity. I actually really loved it and would absolutely pick that flavor again.

Day 2: Howdy Homemade Ice Cream in Indianapolis. At the recommendation of the fellow scooping, I got Dr Pepper Chocolate Chip and Cold Brew and Cookies in a waffle cone. I didn’t love the Dr Pepper flavor, but the Cold Brew and Cookies was a great twist on a coffee ice cream. Flavors worked very well. The ice cream was a little less dense and icier than I prefer texture wise though, and the waffle cone leaked a bunch and wasn’t my favorite. 

Day 3: Louisville Cream in Louisville KY. This place was AMAZING. Do yourself a favor and try it out if you’re in the area. I got Chocolate and Lavender Vanilla. The Chocolate was a darker more bitter chocolate than I prefer, but that is personal taste. The Lavender Vanilla was absolutely incredible. One of my favorite scoops ever. And the texture was absolutely perfect for me. So creamy and rich. This place knows how to make ice cream.

Day 4: Graeter’s in Louisville. I can get a couple of Graeter’s flavors at Whole Foods at home, but we don’t have any shops. I had a scoop of Chocolate and a scoop of Boldly Bearcat. Graeter’s gets praised a lot on this sub so I don’t need to go into it too much, but suffice it to say, I wasn’t disappointed with the quality at all. The Boldly Bearcat (marscapone base with their unique chocolate chips and cookies and cream). For me, their softer swirled in take on chocolate chips was perfect because I don’t like crunchy things in my ice cream, but I can see how that would be polarizing.

I went through 14 days of taking reccomended medicine (daily 2x nexium 40mg, 2x fromilid, 2x ospamox and 1x probiotic).

I still experience hives/urticaria same as before.
I usually take 1 xyzal in 2 days (or approximately 40 hours) and that's more than enough.

I removed coffee, I don't drink coca cola or similar things, removed energy drinks (well, almost).

Food? I don't eat very well, but I removed spicy things for like 98% of time, I also try to eat bland chicken fillet as much as I can, no burgers, no cheese (yogurt or kefir should be fine, right?)..

When should I expect any changes and is there a possibility that these two are not even connected?

Urticaria and that slight fear of it causing breathing issues is really disturbing me.

""Hmm. I don't know. Probably very poorly."" I said, taking a bite of my soggy microwaved Eggos.

I turned my gaze outside. The sun was already up, peaking over and around some of the taller homes in the neighborhood. The streets were barren. I looked towards the wall clock hanging above our fridge. 9:02am. 

""Are you running?"" Darrion spoke up, and as I turned back to him I saw him staring back at me, expectantly awaiting my response. 

""No? Why would I?"" 

""You're one of the oldest here.""

""Yeah only second to you."" I scoffed as I tried to finish off the rest of my food. ""Come on... I wanna get there before it gets too crowded"" I said, tossing the syrup covered paper plate onto the garbage pile.

Darion chuckled softly as he sat his barely sipped coffee on the table. ""You know we're gonna have to take that out soon.""

""Dude the 'garbage man' quit like- day one. If we put it out it'll just rot in the sun like the rest of the trash."" I said as I headed for the door, Darrion close behind me. 

As we walked out the door into the open air, I could already smell the feint odor of rotting garbage accumulating from weeks of roasting on sun-heated asphalt. Crude chalk drawings painted the streets, sprinkled with toys and playthings, items that nobody had any will to clean up. I looked over at Darrion, who's eyes were blankly staring into the vacant eyed windows of an abandoned home. The door of the house was laying there on the ground, torn from it's hinges. I looked away as Darrion tore his eyes from the house, looking at the ground in front of him. We walked most of the way in silence. 



When we made towards the center of town and came to our town's pride and joy. A statue encrusted in gold, depicting a lioness protecting her young. I always found it weird how she faced the town hall. 

The base of the statue was our town's motto. '*Fortes estote, nam futurum nostrum apud eos est*', or '*Stand strong, for our future lies with them*'. With the rest of the town in disarray, it was ironic that our pride and joy stood untouched, as it did when life was normal.  

On top of the statue, there was a young boy yelling to himself on unsure footing. Every few words were cut off as he tried to readjust his already precarious foothold. He saw us approach and took a moment to climb off the statue like a inexperienced equestrian climbs off the back of a horse. 

""Ah hello! You're the first to arrive good sirs!"" The kid beamed, his messy hair slicked and pressed down sloppily. He wore what looked like his Sunday best with a clip-on tie that was on slightly crooked. 

""Hey Mikey-"" Darrion greeted.

""Michael! It's more professional.""

""Mikey. You practicing your speech or something?"" He pat the kids head.

""Yeah and watch the hair! It's my money maker."" He stuck his tongue out as he swatted away Darrion's hand.

Darrion stifled a laugh. ""Where'd you learn to talk like that lil' man?""

He paused. ""Dad. He was a politician y'know.""

""Yeah... My bad champ. You're gonna kill it today.""

Mikey nodded ""Yeah I know. I'm the only one running so I pretty much got it in the bag.""

""Well this was your idea. Not many people are really hopeful for a new leader after Jaime.""

""That's why we need one! Dad always said, without any strong authority, the masses will crumble.""

We began to see a handful of other people walk into view. There were a lot who didn't show. I don't blame them, there was nobody around anymore with the authority to drag them to things like this. As he saw them approach, Mikey ran back over to the lion, crawling up and onto it's back as he prepared himself for his speech. 

""People! Gather around and listen!"" He shouted as loud as his little lungs would let him. Darrion, me, and everyone else who showed up all formed a crowd in front of the statue. 

""My friends, Welcome. I know we've all been struggling since The Rapture last month. You may not believe in Polyphemus, but whatever your belief is, something happened to the adults. Our parents, our older siblings, our families. They're all gone, and we are all that's left."" 

The crowd remained silent. So did I. Looking at Darrion, I saw him staring directly into Mikey's eyes. He had a look on his face, behind his eyes. One of fierce resolve, a determination I hadn't had. 

""Since the loss of our last mayor Jaime, I've noticed a hole that needs to be filled. I'm here to fill that hole, to help our people and to help our town. To do that, we need some ground rules. I know so far rules have been one of our biggest no's, but I believe that we need them to stay safe."" 

I heard uncertain murmuring build up around me. To the majority of us, rules are rules, and rules are bad. A childish thought, one that I might've agreed with had I been that young. 

""My main, biggest rule- one that I hope we can all agree on, is that nobody leaves town. I'm sure you all know that's how we lost Jaime. With respect, he was an idiot to think he could fight Polyphemus. That monster can not be killed. We don't know anything about it. We do not know it's goal, or even what it truly looks like. As long as we stay in town and continue to survive, we will be safe.""

""How do you know it won't come take us? Like it took our parents?"" Called a voice from inside the crowd.

""It hasn't yet has it? If it wanted us, it would've taken us during The Rapture, when it took our parents. But don't think this means our fight is over. We will always continue to fight, to survive. For us, and for our new future!"" Mikey exclaimed with conviction. His words were so finely chosen, It was hard to believe he was just a kid. Darrion and I began to leave as I heard hesitant applause follow the end of Mikey's speech.

""You think they'll listen to him?"" 

""Some will, some won't"" Darrion answered me with a tired edge to his voice.

Our conversation would be soon broken as a noise bellowed into town from the horizon. A loud, mechanical noise that felt like it pulsated through the air, alive and angry. Loud and abrasive, it sounded like a million trumpets all bellowing the same low, gruesome note. A flock of birds fled from one side of the sky to the other as wind began to beckon the trees into a chaotic dance. The sound perpetuated for around twenty seconds before fading out into the aether, the wind following it out. I froze in place as Darrion did the same. Clenching every muscle in my body, I tried to will the feeling of dreaded anguish out of me. I cautiously looked up and into the sky, and there it was. A deep black pillar of smoke writhing up and into the air, dissipating into the surrounding air at a certain height.

My questions for locals - do any towns or bands host regular open air alphorn or alpine brass concerts? Been a recurring highlight of trips to the alps and would love to take the kids along.

Likewise, I've really enjoyed visiting alpages across the Alps and buying some cheese direct. The only such places I can find online are a bit more tourism focused than what I have in mind. Any recommendations?

1l7ge65,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1l7ge65/the_sound_that_wasnt_there/,The sound that wasnt there,"I don’t know when it started, exactly. Days blur together now, each one heavier than the last, like I’m carrying an invisible weight that grows with every step. I’m writing this because I need someone—anyone—to understand what’s happening to me. I’m not crazy. I know I’m not. But if I don’t get this out, I’m afraid I’ll lose what’s left of me.

It began with a sound. Not a loud one, not at first. It was so faint I thought I’d imagined it—a low, rhythmic hum, like the pulse of a distant machine. I’d hear it at night, when the world was quiet, lying in bed with the covers pulled tight. My apartment’s old, the kind with creaky floors and pipes that groan like they’re alive, so I figured it was just the building settling. I’d lived here for years, after all, and old places have their quirks. But this sound… it wasn’t like the others. It had a pattern, almost deliberate, like it was trying to be heard.

I started noticing it more during the day, too. I’d be washing dishes, or reading, or just sitting there, and it would creep in. A faint thrum-thrum-thrum, steady as a heartbeat, but not quite. It was too perfect, too precise, like it was calibrated to some rhythm I couldn’t understand. I checked everything—appliances, the heater, even the walls for some hidden electrical issue. Nothing. My neighbors didn’t hear a thing, either. I asked them, casually, so I wouldn’t sound unhinged. They’d just shrug, give me that polite smile you give someone who’s asking a weird question. One guy even joked about ghosts, which didn’t help.

The sound got louder over time. Not loud like a car horn or a barking dog, but… insistent. It filled the spaces where silence should’ve been. I’d wake up at 3 a.m., heart pounding, because it was there, thrumming in the dark, closer than before. I started sleeping with the TV on, hoping the noise would drown it out, but it didn’t. The hum slipped through, weaving itself into the static, the dialogue, everything. I’d mute the TV, and there it was, waiting for me.

I know what you’re thinking. I thought it, too. Tinnitus, maybe? Some medical thing messing with my head? I went to a doctor, got my ears checked. Clean bill of health. They suggested stress, offered me pills I didn’t take. I didn’t tell them the truth—that the sound wasn’t just in my ears. It was outside me, in the air, in the walls, in the spaces between things. I could feel it, like a vibration under my skin.

Then I started seeing things. Not monsters or shadows, nothing so obvious. It was subtler, crueler. Objects in my apartment would be… wrong. A coffee mug I’d left on the counter would be in the sink. My keys, always on the hook by the door, would show up on the kitchen table. Once, I found a book I’d been reading open to a page I hadn’t reached yet, with a single word circled in pencil: listen. I don’t own a pencil. I don’t know who wrote it.

I stopped sleeping. Not because I didn’t want to, but because the sound wouldn’t let me. It was louder at night, more focused, like it was trying to tell me something. I’d lie there, staring at the ceiling, and it would pulse, slow and deliberate, like it was counting down. To what, I didn’t know. I still don’t.

Last week, I hit my breaking point. I was in the living room, trying to distract myself with my phone, when the sound surged, so intense it made my teeth ache. I dropped my phone and clapped my hands over my ears, but it didn’t help. It wasn’t coming from outside anymore—it was inside me, in my chest, my bones. I stumbled to the mirror, half-expecting to see something wrong with my face, but it was just me, pale and wide-eyed, staring back.

That’s when I noticed the reflection. Not mine—something behind me. The room in the mirror wasn’t my room. The furniture was the same, but the light was wrong, dimmer, colder. And there was a shape in the corner, just out of focus. I spun around, heart hammering, but nothing was there. Just my couch, my lamp, my life. I looked back at the mirror, and the shape was gone, but the room still felt… off. Like it wasn’t mine anymore.

I don’t look in mirrors now. I covered them with sheets, towels, anything I could find. The sound hasn’t stopped, though. It’s constant, a low, relentless hum that follows me everywhere. I’ve tried leaving the apartment, going for walks, sitting in coffee shops, but it’s always there. It’s not tied to this place—it’s tied to me.

Last night, something new happened. I was lying in bed, eyes closed, trying to block it out, when the hum changed. It wasn’t just a sound anymore. It had… texture. Words, almost, but not in any language I know. They buzzed in my skull, sharp and jagged, like they were carving themselves into me. I couldn’t understand them, but I felt their meaning, heavy and cold: it’s coming. I don’t know what “it” is, but I know it’s close. I can feel it in the way the air shifts, the way my skin prickles when I’m alone.

I haven’t left my apartment in days. I’m afraid to. The sound is louder now, and the things in my home keep moving when I’m not looking. The book with the circled word is gone. I tore the place apart looking for it, but it’s just… vanished. My phone’s acting strange, too—texts I don’t remember sending, photos I didn’t take. One of them was just a black screen, but when I looked closer, I swear I saw something move in it, like a shadow under water.

I’m writing this because I need to know I’m not alone in this. If anyone’s experienced something like this—a sound that won’t stop, a feeling like something’s watching, waiting—please tell me. I don’t know how much longer I can take it. The hum is louder as I type this, and the air feels heavy, like it’s pressing down on me. I keep glancing at the covered mirror in the corner, half-expecting to see something peeking out from under the sheet.

I don’t think it’s just a sound anymore. I think it’s something else. Something that’s been here the whole time, waiting for me to notice.

If I stop posting, if I disappear… listen for it. The hum. You’ll know it when you hear it.",1,1749502862.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

I made the mistake of buying oily coffee beans and think this is what caused my issue. Basically beans will grind and make their way into the “waste” bucket. I will get an alert to add coffee, even though the hopper was full and a coffee puck was made and disposed of.


As a part of my troubleshooting, I cleaned the brew group. Also used different beans that were not oily. I tried to brew ground coffee without adding ground coffee to see if anything would come out and had no success.

I did see a video that used decreasing tablets and I might purchase those since they're like 7 dollars.

I wanted to share my progress with you. It's been up and down quite a bit over the last year and a half, but I kept returning to weekly 24 hour, 48 hour, and 72 hour fasts as my schedule and mental capacity allowed. Zero working out (I tried. Still hate it). I'm 41 and female. I was at 390 at my highest in 2023. The weight loss is consistent and I started trusting my body again. In the last 4 or so months, my body started changing significantly. Visibly as well as functionally. My appetite and hunger changed. Very few cravings. Most of the time I can only eat when Im physically hungry. If I'm not hungry, I have a slight aversion to food. Not disgust, just this ""meh... not feeling it"" and when I eat anyway, I'm instantly full and done. I have never experienced this before in my life. I could always eat whenever and whatever before. I'm very happy about that as it allows me to feed my body the right foods when it wants and needs it. 
I have not taken any weightloss aids or medicines. When I fast, I drink water, black coffee, and tea. Sometimes I have a Stevia sweetened product if I want something flavored. In my eat days, I eat mostly fiber, protein, and fat. Not a ton of carbs, but I dont restrict them either. I just don't want them as much anymore. Or my mind goes: ""it's just not worth it."" I do eat plenty of fruits, berries, and legumes though. I have another 50 lbs. to lose to make my goal and I'm going to force myself to add some weightlifting because I want to maintain my muscle mass. I hope that this helps someone. It took a long time and I still have a way to go, but the change in my relationship with food is the most valuable win. I've never been this consistent for that long. I wish I had unlocked this years ago. ",1,1749502765.0,fasting,3,1.0,False

I’d already seen her on my cousin’s Instagram and, naturally, made a few “wow, she’s stunning” comments. Every time, my cousin would shoot me down like an anti-aircraft missile: “She’s too old for you,” or “She wants a super religious guy — like priest-level holy.” Basically: Not your league, buddy. Don’t even try.

Fast-forward to our first real-world interaction. We went on a group walk, and I figured, screw it — I’ll at least talk to her. And wow, it went great. She was super easy to talk to, curious, engaging — it felt like a spark was definitely there. But in the back of my mind? That priest comment was playing on repeat. So I didn’t ask for her number or make any real move. Self-sabotage: activated.

Two weeks later, we run into each other again. We didn’t talk much, but my cousin, professional tease that she is, started joking in front of everyone that I was into her. I tried to play it off with a “she’d never go for me — I’m not exactly a man of the cloth.” That’s when Gorgeous Enigma surprised me and said, “That’s not true… but maybe this isn’t the place to talk about it.” 🚨 Hello? Possible green light?

Then five days ago, my cousin calls — we’re planning an event — and she casually drops, “Oh, by the way, she says hi… also I kind of forced her to give me her number to pass on to you.” Classic cousin meddling.

So, three days ago, I texted her. Nothing too deep — I mentioned I’d thought about calling but didn’t know if she was working. We exchanged a few messages, I hinted that we should meet (she lives literally five minutes away), but haven’t locked anything down.

Now, I was supposed to call her today, but chickened out. My brain’s doing the whole “does she actually like me or is she just being nice because rejecting me would be awkward in cousinland?” routine. Honestly, maybe even God doesn’t know.

So here’s my dilemma:

Do I just bite the bullet and ask her out for a casual walk or coffee? Or should I keep it low-key and text more before suggesting anything?

I suspect I might have ADHD because I tend to easily lose my train of thought, have worse than expected memory but can connect seemingly different concepts easily and have an amazingly vivid imagination, but not officially diagnosed yet.
I've tried caffeine+L-theanine, with decent but short lasting effects.

I just returned from two incredible weeks in Korea and absolutely fell in love with the Cold Brew Frappe from Mammoth Coffee. I would love to try and recreate it at home, but I’m having a bit of trouble nailing down the exact recipe.

I found the following online:

# DIY Cold Brew Coffee Frappe Recipe (Inspired by Mammoth Coffee)

**Ingredients (single serving):**

* **1 cup cold brew coffee** (strength per your taste)
* **1 cup milk or half‑and‑half**
* **1–2 tablespoons simple syrup** (adjust to your sweetness preference)
* **1 cup ice**

However, I don’t recall seeing any sugar or sweetener being added when they made it in-store.

If anyone currently works at Mammoth Coffee or has in the past, and is willing to share the recipe or measurements they use, I would be so grateful!

Thank you so much in advance!",1,1749502325.0,koreatravel,0,1.0,False

Ate the chocolate before I got home, was dizzy and shaking at this point. Ate the entire huge packet of crisps, felt sick but then decided to eat two of the danishes as well. Did not enjoy eating them.

A few hours later im writhing around on the floor in agony, sweating and feeling like I was about to die. I realise how dramatic this sounds, but I totally had the ""sense of doom"" for a while.

Recently got into espresso and looking to make room for espresso accessories, so clearing out my pour-over and travel brewing gear. All items are functional despite cosmetic wear noted below. Prices do not include shipping.

**Items available:**

- **Clever Dripper - $15** - Shows signs of use in the silicone gasket but otherwise works perfectly
- **Hario Skerton burr mechanism - $10** - Glass bottom broke but you can attach to any pint-sized mason jar for a budget hand grinder setup
- **Porlex mini hand grinder - $30** - Works as expected, knob on handle broke off but doesn’t affect grinding function. Fits in a standard AeroPress
- **Aeropress with accessories bundle - $45** - Includes paper filters, Fellow Prismo attachment (comes in original box), and all standard Aeropress accessories
- **Wacaco Minipresso GR 2 - $40** - Comes with original carrying case, all included accessories, and manual
- **Baratza Virtuoso hopper - $10** - Some use but works perfectly, swapped to single dose setup
- **Soto Compact Helix coffee maker - $10** - Used only a few times, just not my preferred brewing method
- **Generic usb-c scale** - smaller than my Acaia Pearl but not small enough for my Gaggia drip tray. Works great as a travel scale.

**Speaker**

**(maybe start with a small gag noise, then internal)**

*Oh… godddd. Where have they gone?? It’s been like 20 minutes since I last saw them. Have they forgotten I’m all tied up down here? Noo, of course they haven’t. They just told me they loved me, after all. Arggh, my head’s such a mess! I gotta be dreaming, right? How can this be real? My oldest friend, the person I care about the most in this world and… they actually like me back! Me!!? After all these years. All the times I’ve fantasised about them. I just can’t believe it! Ahhh mannn, I feel so warm right now. My stomach is soooo full of butterflies. I just want them to kiss me again. Ouch!*

**(normal, through gag)**

  Where… you…gone?

**(internal)**

*Okay. Seriously, when* *are* *they coming back?*

**(struggles slightly)**

*Man, these ropes. Still as secure as when they first tied me. This is really not helping my head. Like at all. Are they really planning on leaving me tied up like this… all weekend? I mean, they said they were, but… did they actually mean it? I’m… still… yup, stuck. These knots really are complicated! I can’t help but feel they tricked me into this. It’s no accident I can’t get loose. Should I be, like, worried here? Ahhh man. My nose itches!*

**(maybe a frustrated gag noise)**

*Nooo, don’t be silly. Nothing to worry about. It’s them! They’ve always been such a good friend and after what they just said… no. I’m… I’m fine. I just need to chill. Accept I’m their prisoner for a while and just deal with it until they get bored, and then they’ll untie me and… wow, I don’t even know what happens next. Oh god, “prisoner” sounds so weird. But I guess they* *are* *in charge of me now. That’s such a… weird thought. Kinda exciting, but… god, can they get back in here already before I go insane?? I just need to clear my mind, and maybe imagine how good it’s gonna feel when they untie me and kiss me again. Oh man. That’s not helping!*

**(pause)**

*I guess we’re kinda in a relationship now, right? Like officially dating? They didn’t actually say but after this… I kind of feel our friendship is definitely changed forever! Maybe I’ll ask them when they come back. If they take my gag off, that is! Ahh, okay, I have to admit, I’m definitely* *not* *enjoying the gag situation. Why did they have to use tape? It tastes worse than the cloth! This really isn’t cool, and it’s not necessary. It’s not like I’m gonna call for help or anything! No, I think we need to talk about the gag when they’re back. It really sucks. Maybe if I try, I can lick it off? Okay, if I can… urgh, god, the taste! Okay, keep going, keep going… oh, great. Now it’s just rolled up inside my mouth and I still can’t talk. Wonderful.*

**(normal, through gag)**

Please, come back!

**(internal)**

*Did I hear some plates then? What, they making dinner or something? Oh, footsteps! Finally!*

**(normal, through gag)**

Please can you take this off?

**(internal)**

*Do they look a little frustrated with me? That’s…new. Maybe they’re not happy I tried to get my gag off. Well, if I’m honest,* *I’m* *not happy they gagged me! Ouch!*

**(normal)**

Hey, that hurt my mouth! What? Of course I tried to get it off. You try having tape on your mouth. It’s not exactly fun! Anyway, that doesn’t matter! Where have you been? I was starting to think you’d forgotten about me!

**(pause)**

Well, it’s cute of you to say that could never happen, but still! You really shouldn’t leave me alone all tied up like this, you know! Anything could have happened!

**(pause)**

I dunno! What if there was like a snake down here or something? Can’t exactly run away like this, can I? You may have noticed I’m kind of at your mercy here, and that comes with responsibility. No, I’m not saying there *are* snakes, but… mmph!

**(kissing noise)**

Damn. When did you get to be such a good kisser? No, it’s fine. I like it when you kiss me.

**(pause)**

Just maybe don’t leave me so long next time, okay? What have you been doing anyway? You’ve been cooking? I thought so! Ohhh, yeah! My favourite! You know that, of course you do. I’ve made it for you enough times! Thankyou.  

**(pause)**

Urm, am I okay to have some water? I can still taste the gag. Please? You brought some down with you? Thanks.

**(drinking water)**

That’s better. Mann, I still feel sweaty from all the struggling I did earlier. God, I bet I really stink by now. I don’t? Well, that’s nice of you to say but I don’t believe you! Oh? I never smell! Hehe, well, now you’re definitely lying!  

**(sighs)**

It’s cute though. You always know what to say to make me feel better. No, you do!! So much! Like last month! Remember? When I went out on that date and the guy was a complete douche? I came home feeling like absolute crap, and you were sat on the couch waiting for me with ice cream and pizza. You stayed up with me all night, just talking, and I remember thinking why the hell couldn’t I just go on a date with you? Why couldn’t I just tell you how I felt?  

**(pause)**

Are you okay? You suddenly look a little sad. What? Why *didn’t* I tell you? I… said before! I just… I was so worried you’d reject me. I see the people you date. Like, they’re always so much cooler than me, and prettier, and… woah. You look really mad. Have I said something?

**(pause)**

No, I wasn’t judging you for dating other people! I just… I was just trying to tell you how much I… I dunno! Ignore me. I was talking garbage, like always. My mind is kinda all over the place. Maybe I’m feeling a little vulnerable right now, okay? Wonder why *that* could be.

**(pause)**

Oh. Smiling again. Good to see. Yeah, yeah, I know, I’m sooo funny.

**(sighs)**

This whole situation is just soo… I don’t even know. Arghh, my nose itches something rotten! Please can you… yeah, thankyou. That’s it.

**(pause)**

Can I…ask you something? How long have you been planning to… tie me up like this? No no, I’m not saying I *mind* or anything, not *really*, but you did kinda trick me into it. Telling me it was a challenge so I’d agree. There’s (ouch!) no way you could have done this to me if I didn’t let you.

**(pause)**

Yeah, you can be honest!

**(pause)**

Urm… okay. So you’ve fantasised about kidnapping me for a while? Not sure what to say to that. Is this like a… kink thing or something with you, seeing me helpless? I mean, I’m not massively against it but… for a first date, maybe it’s a little much.

**(pause)**

I dunno. What *do* you do on first dates? Go out for coffee? Get some food? See a movie? Yeah it’s different for us because we knew each other before, but… still.

**(pause)**

There’s another reason you’ve done this? Okay, what is it? Wait, really? As if you thought I’d run away from you! Why would I? Well, I know you’ve had bad luck in the past with people you’ve dated, but I’d never do that to you! Did you not hear me when I told you how I felt? I can’t imagine you not being in my life! Do you not… trust me or something?

**(pause)**

If you trust me, then why do you think I’d leave you? Hey, what is this talk? Who on this Earth knows you better than me? There’s no way I’d get bored of you. You’re the most interesting person ever! Like, you’re just awesome. I watch how fixated you get on things. You don’t let anything stop you getting what you want! I’ve always respect that.

**(slight sound of discomfort)**

I mean, I’m guessing your latest project was researching knots, yeah, cos looking at my hands right now… yeah! You must have seriously been worried I’d try to leave you. Is this your way of…stopping that… whether I like it or not?

**(pause)**

I mean, it’s sweet how you feel so strongly about me, but, if I’m honest, that’s kind of a bit… odd, you know? Like you’ve literally taken my freedom here. I’m stuck and I just… am I your girlfriend, or your prisoner right now?

**(nervous laugh)**

I mean, yeah, I guess, I *can* be both, but…

**(pause)**

Okay, fine, I admit it, it *was* kinda hot at the start. No, I trust you, I do, and I *am* still up for this roleplay or game or… whatever it is. But, maybe… can you loosen my wrists just a little bit? Like I’m literally hanging here and my wrists are gonna start to hurt. Come on. Please. I mean, if it’s roleplay, I don’t exactly need to be tied up for real, right? Like, I can just pretend to be your prisoner, if that’s what you want? If you just loosen the rope, I won’t free myself fully until you tell me. I promise.

**(sighs)**

Yeah. I guess if can get free on my own it’s not quite the same, but… what else do you have planned here? Like, how am I supposed to eat dinner?

**(pause)**

You’re gonna move me but keep my hands and feet tied? Urm… don’t you think that’s a bit much? You’ve not *really* kidnapped me here. Riggght?

**(pause)**

Just… relax and enjoy myself? Okay. Look. Full disclosure. I am starting to get a little weirded out by this. It’s not something I’ve done before, and… what? It’s not like I can help it! I can’t control how I feel!

**(pause)**

Wait, what??? I just need to behave myself? Okay, I know it’s part of the game, but that’s a little rude. I’m being honest about my feelings, and I feel like you’re just dismissing them. That’s a little uncool, you know?

**(pause)**

I need to show you respect? Okay, you know what, I’m kinda over this. I think I’ve had enough of this game. No no no, enough. You need to listen to me*.* Just untie me right now, please. We can go have some dinner, maybe go out for a drink or something, but this game needs to stop. I mean it. Untie me.

**(pause)**

Yes, I’m deadly serious. Untie. Me. Now! Wait, where you going? You need to check on dinner? No, I said get your butt over here and let me go… what the… no… do *not* put that tape back on… mmh!!

**(yandere leaves, then internal thoughts)**

*I can’t believe they gagged me again! That is seriously not cool. Okay, I’m really freaking out now. God… fricking… damn it, these ropes! I’ve seriously got to get free. There’s gotta be a way! Pleassseeee! Urghhh!*

**(deep breaths, still internal)**

*Okay, calm down. They’re my friend right? Surely they’re not actually planning on hurting me… right?? Oh man, I’ve just walked right into this. There’s nobody else here but us, and I’ve literally let myself be kidnapped! I’m such an idiot! Okay. I just need to keep calm, and figure all of this out. I can’t untie myself, but there must be a way to escape. After that, I… I really don’t know. But I can’t play along anymore. Whatever they’re thinking… whatever’s happening between us… this isn’t right. Ouch, these knots! Ahh. God. I think I’m gonna need some help here…*",3,1749501875.0,ASMRScriptHaven,0,1.0,False

I spent ages scrolling through this thread trying to find food recs etc in Sardinia and thought I’d share some great places I ate and drank on a recent quick trip to Cagliari, in case it helps anyone!

We stayed very central so I know this probably won’t capture the wide variety of food and options in the city, but we did our best with 2 nights: 

Ditrizio Pasticceria - amazing coffee here and the pastries were yum too. Very central and great for breakfast. 

Caffè dell'Arte Specialty Coffee - best coffee I had in Sardinia, I even bought beans to take home. Really friendly service and great food too- not particularly Italian food though be warned but yummy nonetheless. 

Grotta Marcello - I was a bit skeptical as it’s dead centre of Piazza Jenne. But food was fantastic and service was very friendly, with our waiter very forthcoming and happy to recommend favourites from the menu. I had fish of the day and couldn’t fault it- done perfectly. Beautiful setting amongst the caves, but gets very very busy after 9PM! 

Zero Gravity- best pizza I had in Sardinia and maybe my life. Not a traditional pizzeria, lots of outside the box options. Go for the crusco & cacao, you won’t be disappointed. 

La Focazzia - found out after going that these guys have tons of locations and rightly so. One focaccia sandwich did me two lunches and they’re stunning. Pricey- about €9+ each- but well worth the money for what you get; freshly made on yummy focaccia with great fresh ingredients. I recommend the LaClassizia and the La Mielosa

Eva coffee & wine- name speaks for itself, also did a really nice Aperol

Vittorino was the best gelato place we tried :)

1l7fqyy,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l7fqyy,Victrola VV-XVIII - Restore & Overhaul (Novice) - (Part II - AFTER) - Hardware before and after.,"Here’s part II. It’s actually been over a month since I started.  This is just the *hardware* lol. I have lived the darkest days of my life in just the past week alone.  Doing this work seems to help me through it, however. A cromagnon, primal rage is being purged from me from unspeakable abuse that somehow decided to manifest itself NOW in my 50s lmfao. I apologize if I’m ever anything but kind and thoughtful- that is the “me” I want to always exude, and while in these lows it’s hard to stop the knuckle-dragger in me- but it is still in my control and I own him, too, so I have to rein him in. I apologize for and own my wrongs. As always, I appreciate everyone here- your kind wisdom, guidance, and encouragement are appreciated. Thank you, and thanks for viewing!

_**TL;DR**_ **VV-XVIII #915 part II (after). Lots of rust and black substance overall; all gold, brass, or plated surface required minor dilution of cleaner to create a “wet” working area so as to use a brass brush or blade to razor-scrape to remove carbon, rust, and corrosion; exposed steel, even blued steel, was covered in surface rust and included microscopic pitting in all plated surfaces. The gold plating had intermittent pitting but thankfully it was mostly superficial, like no deeper than 100μ (micrometers- strand of hair). Realistically all gold should be re-plated, but the pitting is so microscopic it is not visible to the naked eye. Rust-free Exhibition reproducer rebuilt with new gaskets, viable mica, and reconstituted rubber isolator; Test video posted; next is PART III - Restore & Overhaul (Novice) - CABINET REFURBISHMENT - Veneer & Carvings**

*Note*: I have not cleaned the Victor data plate. It’s going to take the utmost care  to remove and clean it, like unrolling a Dead Sea scroll. Not the first thing I’ve done like it, but it’s the *OPERATION* game on steroids lol

*PICS*

**(1)**  Front view- door knobs not yet cleaned; all others cleaned; **(2)** “Look Under The Lid!”; **(3)** montage with “before” image included; **(4 thru 7)** reproducer cleaning and rebuild; **(8 thru 15)** lid hinge & hardware, taper tube support & full tone arm, key & crank escutcheons, locking mechanisms, and everything else I forgot to mention lol. Note: I have abandoned the XIV gold refurb I was gonna do simultaneously for the time being. I need focus.

*MAJOR LESSONS LEARNED:*

**Lesson 1**: I use FLITZ metal cleaner/polish on gold, any plating, paint, and exposed higher grade steel- which is pretty much all Victor used. The “pot metal” amalgamation/abomination started in the orthophonic era for VICTOR at least from what I understand, which was pretty much the end of its domination in the market during its “heyday”- aka the beginning of the end. It is thick AF and while not fully non-water-based, there is some in the ingredients I believe. While I don’t recommend it, if you add maybe a baby spoon sized bit of water to a heaping tablespoon of the polish and mix it thoroughly, like until you don’t see the water at all anymore, but not so wet that it’s like weak coffee, you’ll get a nice mushy “wet toothpaste” kind of consistency. It needs to be like cough syrup, consistency, because what you don’t want is for the metal that has already been exposed to rust to continue to do so. That said, while scraping or brushing or even simply wiping, work in small areas and in some logical order. DO NOT dig. DO NOT overbrush- even with brass bristles. I found scraping was the only option in most cases. It must be done with extreme care, or else you will end up with a horrible mix of colors because you will have gone into the substrates of metals. You’ll see it on the tone arm shaft pipe near the head/tone arm joint where it’s completely down past the gold and into copper/brass/steel. If you want a quality piece, get it re-gilded or find a suitable replacement with less wear. This one wasn’t too bad, but there’s enough pitting and wear that it really needs it. I’m going to try other methods and do a little more research next time.  This piece was an experiment anyway- I expect things will not be perfect. If I need the perfection, I will source it out. I’m satisfied with this as it is currently, however. If I ever choose for this piece to go to an auction block- which I likely never will- it would need to be in impeccable shape and satisfy even the keenest appraiser, and I will bring it there- but that’s not what I’m doing right now at least. This is how I’m working my personal learning experience- lots of room for error because I gave myself spare parts, lots of time, energy, and opportunity to learn, observe, and try, and also because it helps that this is the only thing I’m doing right now. I am not physically or mentally capable of returning to work, and this is about all I can handle along with breathing.

**Lesson 2**:  get a cheap soldering iron. Quickest and easiest way to get the wax to melt onto the mica over the steel when doing the reproducer. Heating the actual screw or tip of the sound vibrating bar draws it right down. Definitely used the https://grammophon-platten.de/page.php?490 site. This is integral to the rebuild. You must find your own way, Padawan, when it comes to melting. Practice lots. Undo and redo. Don’t practice on the real thing lol… do it on that when you’ve done it enough to feel comfy doing it. And when you do it, do it quick, do it once, don’t use too much, don’t use too little, follow the directions to the letter, and leave it alone once you’ve done the one side. Repeat the steps for the other side to ensure you’re ready to do it with the physically different opposite surface.

**Lesson 3**: Abrasion. The messed up thing is that some of this stuff is so caked on that what it really needs is a soaking to draw the dirt up from the pitted areas where water has pushed its way through. If there’s a solution in which to bathe or otherwise immerse the piece that won’t cause further oxidization, that’s what I need. Regardless, if there’s pitting and rust is present, the surface coating is obviously compromised and the rust must be eradicated so that it can never spread again. So basically the only thing I found that seems to work is BRASS BRUSHES, which are super soft and don’t scratch the gold AND doesn’t seem to wear it down too much. Same applies with cloth rubbing: too much will result in a horrible hodge podge of different metals (see the little crook arm thing “tone arm shaft pipe”). Rust is obviously removable, but the level to which you retain your plating will show once finished. Scraping with the sharpest, thinnest, and easiest to hold razor blade angled horizontally and making little back and forth scraping motions- ONLY slightly scraping/touching the surface of the black graphite stuff. The reason I needed the thinner paste is because the paste dries in mere seconds and does not give you a smooth, soft, grinding amalgam (that has no abrasives in it- Flitz doesn’t as far as I know). It needs to be “wet” to spread and scrape. Scraping is like a light “sliding” … if you’re near sighted, do like I do and take your glasses off and bury your face in it.. just don’t spray it in your eyes. If you need a magnifying glass, get one that you don’t have to hold. You will be taking about 5 minutes to cover like 1 square inch lol… THEN you have to do it all again to get the stuff you missed lol. While this was time-consuming and hard, I retained probably like 90% of the gilding that was viable, even despite some slight rust. One of the last few attached pics has my completely cleaned XVI’s tone arm with my XVIII’s on the right for comparison.

**Lesson 4**: 1 part wintergreen oil to 3 parts highest % rubbing alcohol. If flange/isolator or other rubber is solid but intact, mix it up in a jar, drop your thing in there, and let it sit a couple or few days. Wear gloves, unless you wanna smell like Wint-O-Green Lifesavers all day lol.. plus, if you’re sensitive because of asthma or other condition- ventilate or do outside or to your tolerance. I’m not a scientist nor do I understand chemicals well, but it seems clear to me that once the wintergreen oil is introduced it seems to become part of the solution. The rubber soaks the alcohol in through the microscopic pores or cracks, carrying the oil with it and depositing it! It’s a crazy process to see! Let it sit and dry on a paper towel once you hook and fish it out. It’ll swell- don’t mess with it. It may crack in this process- if so, it could mean it just wasn’t meant to be lol… the XVIII’s isolator was SUPPLE… its original, but it’s unreal how supple it still was, still needed 2 soaks- one for 2 days and one more for one day. It’s absolutely supple and usable now. I intend to buy new- they’re just not available where I need to purchase them yet. 

**Lesson 5**: Buy a gallon of white vinegar. GREAT for locking mechanisms, original roller casters, and almost any rusted steel. Throw it in the bath for a couple few days, come back and bam! Like new! I know there are other ways, too. So far this has been 100% success rate for me. It’s a lot of fun* watching it bubble the rust flakes off. *if you enjoy watching paint dry

**Lesson 6**: I could be wrong, but either whoever owned this smoked and it left a crackly veneer on the metal or the Victor folks, dealer, or owner put some kind of shellac or coating on the gold. It gave the gold a much deeper color, but also came off as little clear sheets like a lacquer or something would. Underneath was clean gold, and you could see that any pitting went down at least a hair width depth and there was that much gold left. That may have made my scraping more successful.

**Lesson 7** Mica- I will acquire some new as well. I have enough spares in very good condition that did what this one I chose did :) I was a beautiful song- like an A3 (third octave- and I always got between 216 and 218 hz). Is there supposed to be an actual factual tuning for these?

*ODD NUGGET*: the back side of the lid hinge, which never saw the light of day since 1915, had a cool little engraving on it. It took me a while, and I knew they only made their own stuff- cabinetry as well as hardware… but there’s a swirly “@” thing with “Co”- and I’ve concluded that it’s a fancy “V”. As in “V Co”.

I can say for certain,in my humble opinion, that the fix is in right now. Bev is overuling herself now, without any hesitation.  The last 4 defense witnesses, Dr.Laposada, Dr.Russell, Dr.Rentschler and Dr.Wolfe were going to destroy the CW case to pieces. Lally wouldn't have dared to put those motions forth, just before the end of the trial. He is not payed enough to destroy himself professionally.

Hank doesn't care, and I think i know now why he was hired. He is unscrupulous enough, to pivot midtrial, changing the CW theory, changing the experts reports and opinions and more importantly, not letting the defense present their case.

Everything started to feel transactional — endless apps, ghosting, ego games. I wasn’t looking to just “hook up,” I was looking for something real — someone soft, kind, feminine.

A few months back I started taking short trips to Mexico — mostly Guadalajara, but also Mexico City and San Miguel. I wasn’t thinking “I’m gonna find a wife,” but I *was* open to it. What I didn’t do? I didn’t touch Tinder.

Instead, I started making eye contact, saying hello, walking slowly. I’d sit outside cafés and strike up conversations. I got used to rejection and awkward moments — but I also started having real, unfiltered connections.

I met my girl in a bookstore of all places. She was looking at a Gabriel García Márquez novel, and I asked if she’d read *Love in the Time of Cholera*. That turned into coffee, which turned into hours talking, which turned into a second trip back two weeks later. Now we’re six months in.

She’s not flashy. She’s not “influencer hot.” She’s warm, loyal, nurturing. She calls me “mi león.” She packs me snacks when I take the bus to another city. She’s met my family on FaceTime. This isn’t just some fling — I’m genuinely thinking long-term.

So yeah, Tinder might work for some guys, but if you’re looking for a wife — the *real* kind — try looking up instead of down at your screen. Mexico isn’t perfect, but it’s full of women who still believe in love, respect, and building something together.

#### The UK’s Current Stance on Digital Nomads

##### No Official “Digital Nomad Visa”

Other countries roll out the red carpet for remote workers. The UK? Not so much. There’s no “digital nomad visa.” No golden ticket. Just a patchwork of old-school visas, none designed for the laptop class.

##### What the UK Government Says

The official line: If you’re working—even for a foreign company—you probably need a work visa. The rules are clear as mud, but the message is simple: Don’t try to game the system.

#### Tourist Visas: The Mirage of Remote Work

##### What’s Allowed on a Visitor Visa?

Tourist visas let you see the sights, not send Slack messages. Officially, you can attend meetings, conferences, maybe sign a contract. But actual work? Off-limits.

##### Risks of Working While on Holiday

Get caught working on a tourist visa, and you risk deportation. Fines. A black mark on your passport. The UK doesn’t play.

*💡 Ready to level up your remote income? [Discover Your Digital Nomad Potential—Instant Results!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)*

#### Business Visitor Visas: The Tightrope Walk

##### Permitted Activities

Business visitor visas are stricter than a British headmaster. You can negotiate deals, attend events, maybe train staff. But remote work for your overseas boss? Still a no-go.

##### The Fine Print That Trips You Up

The devil’s in the details. Even a Zoom call with your home office can cross the line. Don’t assume. Always check the rules.

#### The Elusive Sponsored Work Visa

##### Skilled Worker Visa: Who Qualifies?

The UK loves skills—if you have the right ones. Tech, engineering, healthcare. But you need a sponsor. No sponsor, no dice.

##### Sponsor Requirements: The Gatekeepers

Sponsorship is a fortress. Only registered companies can sponsor. They control the keys. Freelancers and solo nomads? Left in the cold.

*🧭 Not sure if you can make it as a digital nomad? [Find Out in 90 Seconds—It’s Free!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)*

#### Innovator and Start-Up Visas: For the Bold (and Funded)

##### What’s Required?

Got a groundbreaking idea? Willing to pitch it to a panel of gatekeepers? The UK might let you in. But you’ll need funding, a business plan, and nerves of steel.

##### Is It Worth the Hassle?

These visas are for the ambitious. The hustlers. If you just want to code from a cottage, look elsewhere.

#### Global Talent Visa: The Unicorn Path

##### Who Gets In?

Are you a world-class coder? An artist with accolades? The Global Talent visa is for the best of the best. Mediocrity need not apply.

##### The Application Gauntlet

It’s a marathon of paperwork, endorsements, and proof. Only the relentless survive.

*🔥 Want to know if you’re sitting on untapped income? [Test Your Digital Nomad Income Potential—Free Tool!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)*

#### Remote Work for Overseas Companies: Legal or Loophole?

Working for a non-UK company doesn’t make you invisible. The law cares where you are, not just who pays you. If you’re in the UK, you’re on their radar.

#### Tax Residency: The Stealth Trap

##### How Many Days Before You Owe?

Stay too long, and you’re a tax resident. The threshold is a moving target, but cross it and HMRC wants a piece of your pie.

##### Double Taxation Dilemmas

Paying tax twice? It happens. Double-taxation treaties help, but only if you know the rules. Ignorance is expensive.

*✈️ Dreaming of a nomad life? [See if you can earn on the road—90-Second Free Test!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)*

#### Banking and Payments: The Financial Minefield

##### Opening Accounts as a Nomad

UK banks love paperwork. Proof of address. Proof of existence. As a nomad, you’re an anomaly. Fintech to the rescue—sometimes.

##### Getting Paid Without Borders

International payments mean fees, delays, headaches. Wise, Revolut, and crypto are your allies. Traditional banks? Not so much.

#### Health Insurance: NHS or Bust?

##### Who Qualifies for Free Care?

The NHS is legendary. But it’s not for visitors. No visa, no coverage. Private insurance is your lifeline.

##### Private Options for the Uninsured

Shop around. Compare. Don’t gamble with your health. One accident can bankrupt you.

#### Housing: Nomad-Friendly or Not?

##### Short-Term Lets vs. Long-Term Leases

Airbnb is king for short stays. Long-term? Landlords want references, deposits, stability. Nomads are wildcards.

##### The Landlord’s Perspective

You’re a risk. No job in the UK? No local history? Expect suspicion, higher deposits, or outright rejection.

#### Internet and Coworking: The Digital Lifeline

##### Best Cities for Connectivity

London, Manchester, Edinburgh—fast Wi-Fi, endless coffee, coworking galore. Rural? Prepare for buffering.

##### Top Coworking Spaces

WeWork, Huckletree, local gems. Your tribe is waiting, but it’ll cost you.

*🌍 Want to know if your skills can fund your next adventure? [Take the 90-Second Digital Nomad Income Test—Free!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)*

#### Community: Finding Your Tribe in the UK

##### Meetups and Networking

Nomads are everywhere—if you know where to look. Meetup.com, Eventbrite, expat Facebook groups. Plug in or burn out.

##### Online Hubs for Nomads

Slack channels, Discord servers, Telegram groups. The digital campfire never dies.

#### The Brexit Effect: What Changed?

Brexit slammed the door on easy EU access. Rules are tighter. Loopholes are fewer. The UK is an island—literally and figuratively.

#### Stories from the Trenches: Nomads Who Tried

Some succeed. Most struggle. Tales of visa runs, near-misses, and bureaucratic nightmares. Learn from their scars.

*💡 Ready to level up your remote income? [Discover Your Digital Nomad Potential—Instant Results!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)*

#### The Risks: Deportation, Fines, and Burned Bridges

Get caught bending the rules and you’re out—sometimes for good. The UK doesn’t do second chances. Play smart or pay the price.

#### Workarounds: What Some Nomads Actually Do

Some risk it. Short stays, constant movement, plausible deniability. Others partner with UK companies, get sponsored, or marry in. None are foolproof.

#### The Future: Will the UK Catch Up?

The world is changing. The UK is watching. Will they launch a digital nomad visa? Maybe. For now, it’s wait and see.

#### Conclusion: Should You Try to Work in the UK as a Digital Nomad?

The UK is a paradox. Open for business, closed to nomads. If you want to work here, you’ll need grit, luck, and a plan B. Or you could just visit, enjoy the rain, and move on.

But we’re undecided on whether to swap the tickets and do Elrow at Unvrs (going to cost €85) on Saturday & Glitterbox in Hi on Sunday (going to cost €55) 

We got insurance on the black coffee tickets so will get the whole €100 back each to buy the elrow tickets if we decide to swap. But might lose some money on Carl cox but will pay the difference. 

We’ve seen black coffee & glitterbox before and loved them both (especially glitterbox) but never been to elrow or carl cox before, so we’re undecided. We kinda wanna do both venues and don’t want to go the same place both nights

Also, opinions on if Carl cox is worth going if anybody seen his opening set?

1l7ffnu,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l7ffnu,Awkwardly long living room - thoughts?,"Hi everyone! I live in a lovely old 1928 home with a long, narrow front room. I'm hoping to optimize the layout and this is the current footprint. In short, the left side of the room feels empty—but it's also an improvement from two prior layouts we've seen.

Some context:

* Prior owner had two facing love seats smack in the middle of the room, which had sitters quite far from the fireplace. We joked that it looked like you would film interviews in the space.
* We've also seen another old layout that had the back of the couch to the window which was odd. 
* Hoping to keep the couch, coffee table, and chairs, which are new.
* Console on the north wall holds our record player with a small record shelf beside, the only media we keep in the room. Ideally, we'd keep the player but the console was a ""good enough"" choice.
* Room to the south (through french doors) is our dining room. West is the front entryway. The two doors to the east (set back from our fireplace) lead to a sleeping porch used as an office. More context on the second layout.

We use this room for socializing, not as a media or play space. Ideas very welcome. And if this is the best we can do, I'll at least feel validated. But I figured I'd crowdsource it before I gave up.",1,1749500629.0,floorplan,3,1.0,False

I just watched the [**Mayor's Desk video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byE8Bp5NI00) with Rob Barefoot and James Hutt, the mayor of Balance Town, where James Hutt answers community questions.

[Last week's summary here!](https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkred/comments/1kw36w8/may_23_2025_mayors_desk_summary/) This week, a lot of the questions they look at were already addressed when going through and looking at what needed to be clarified in Interface 4. [Changes to Interface 4, the errata, can be found here.](https://rtalsoriangames.com/2025/05/28/interface-red-volume-4-is-updated-physical-prints-coming-soon/) New downloads of the PDF will have these changes in there already. 

**6:50 to 13:45**

* Can you install medical grade cyberarms in the artificial shoulder mount? Yes?!?! The artificial shoulder mount is already so much humanity loss, James thinks allowing the non humanity loss cyberarms are still balanced. (Note: none of the games I have been in have allowed this, either because having additional hands is so powerful they think it is worth more humanity loss, or because thematically having extra arms is, strictly speaking, less ""human."")

* Do viruses in neuroports follow the same rules as quickhacks? Yes, James believes you can leave a virus at the bottom of a neuroport netarch. Things seen in other cyberpunk media that don't fit into existing quickhack categories, such as Placide in the video game, would be examples of neuroport viruses. Rob reminds us anything in the EMK may change when the full 2077 sourcebook comes out. 

* How do they think batman would fare in night city, and what would he do? There's a very close Batman analogue in 2020, Mercman, and in RED, they say there are some vigilante Batman-like characters, but weren't sure of specific named examples. Nonlethal weapons and smoke grenades are two good examples of Batman-like gear in RED. ""There's a reason it's called the grapple gun"" -James Hutt

* Do they think there's a place for a realistic midrange shotgun? The core book shotgun shells are not very realistic. James says they can't talk about this, which could there's a future release that has something similar planned! 

**13:48 to 21:10**

* Is there a way to get Cliff's Notes of the stream? Yes! Corgopolis and I, and now Lowjack, write these out. Mine are not complete, I try to always be clear I'm trying just to get the main points and general times for reference, so people can quickly get to the right part of the video if they want a thorough understanding.

* Why does EMP hardening for cyberware cost humanity, when not being deactivated by an EMP is a function of meat parts, so this should make you feel more human? James says it's a paranoia thing. You have to be a level of paranoid to install that type of stuff in your cyberware, like wearing a bulletproof t-shirt and saying ""well, what if I get shot?"" (Wearing bulletproof armor in real world everyday terms, of course. We all wear bulletproof t-shirts in cyberpunk!). Anything bringing you above the capabilities of an ordinary meat body is supposed to lower humanity. (Note: My advice is to try not to think of humanity loss solely in in-universe terms. First of all, think of it as a balancing mechanic. More useful cyberware is supposed to have more humanity loss to balance it out.)

* If we can fabricate live chickens, can we also fabricate cyberpets and babies? ""I don't think I said 'live.'"" -James Hutt. He wants to look into cloning more and think about it. But if there's cloned meat, there has to be someone cloning it, and you can be that person. But if you try to do Fullmetal Alchemist, it's not going to work (meaning, if you try to make a copy of a human being complete with memories). There's a 2020 book with a cloning plotline, Land of the Free, if you want some ideas. (Note: Identical twins are naturally occurring clones. When trying to think of how to write clones in fiction, always keep this in mind. Clones are not inherently soulless, monstrous, or lesser. They are not the same person as the original.)

* You cannot hide while holding your action to shoot someone behind cover. You have to be exposed in order to look to see if your enemy leaves cover. But you can shoot first before they can shoot when they get out of cover.

**21:24 to 27:30**

* Do NPCs benefit from the mantis blade [Streamlined enhancement](https://rtalsoriangames.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/RTG-CX-CyberwareEnhancements.pdf)? It requires spending luck on the attack roll.  James says we should feel free to give NPCs a little luck. That enhancement is designed with players in mind, but adding luck to NPCs doesn't break the game.

* For invented upgrades made with a tech's Invention Expertise, does the tech need additional materials? Can GMs lower the price category of the additional materials below Expensive, after the first prototype, or can you do it the moment the blueprint is finished? [Similar to the coffee question.](https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkred/comments/1kpfzur/may_16_2025_mayors_desk_summary_more_about/) The first one has to be expensive, but you can invent a process that allows you to make things cheaper than the expensive price category. If you're the GM, you can just make things a certain way. If you're the player, you must understand your Invention role ability is about working with the GM to build something that isn't broken for your campaign. If you find after the fact that something is broken, the GM can rebalance it later. 

* Is it possible to create a linear frame that doesn't use hydraulics? This is going into the tech's Invention ability again. Look at what you want to be different about it compared to the existing linear frames, and talk to your GM about if that could be an invention. If instead this is a story question, asking if this fits the tech level, yes, nanomachines already exist in cyberpunk and could do things crazier than this, so it could exist in universe.

**27:53 to 34:20**

* What's the philosophy of using netrunning in gigs? Should there be one big netarch, or several smaller ones? You can think of the ways the building could resist you, which not only allows the netrunner to feel badass, but techs, who can also interact with automated security, to feel badass. If there's a place the players shouldn't be, it should have traps. (Note: Some GMs I've played with find [Scoobydoom's examples of netarchs by budget](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dwn8RWEWARjZQcDjyEC21ZqvDpKExm5x_fKE978IEuk/edit?usp=drivesdk) to be helpful. He recommends looking at the kind of budget the owners of the netarch would have, when deciding what to put in it. Not all GMs do that, though. Some roll randomly, some disregard price.)

* Are black ICE a net obstruction? Black ICE are not obstructions, but passwalls are. If you wanted, you could homebrew something that isn't a passwall but is a net obstruction, and Rob and James talk about some homebrew ideas. 

* What's a cool, non game breaking way to raise a stat to 10 without drugs? ""They're trying to start the power creep."" -Rob. ""There's a reason FBCs are the limiter for that. The human body doesn't go past a certain amount without artificial means."" Perfected Hydraulics from Going Metal are an example of how one would raise stats that can't normally be permanently raised, and they only go up to 8. James says he would not give ways to raise empathy, in his opinion.

* Can you load a demon onto a cyberdeck and deploy it in a netarch? No, James had an earlier draft that allowed that, and it outshone programs too much.

**35:05 to 38:10**

* Can you use the [Duel Caster from Elflines](https://rtalsoriangames.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/RTG-CPR-DLC-ElflinesOnlinetheTCGv1.3.pdf) with Gun Fu?  No, Gun Fu states the gun you use must be a Rof2 weapon. 

* Who would win in a fight, 1 Adam Smasher or 100 martial artists? Rob says Adam Smasher, James says 100 martial artists. 

* Some martial arts resolutions requiring Brawling attacks is intended. Brawling attacks don't halve armor, so requiring you to use them in order to fulfill a resolution offers the player a tradeoff, where they could choose to use a martial arts attack, or they could choose the lower damage brawling attack and possibility of a resolution.

* How much choice do drivers and passengers have about whether they can use bulletproof glass when a vehicle is attacked? Both driver and passenger can raise or lower the windows as needed.

**38:14 to 43:54**

* Does Gun Fu damage cap at the gun's damage, even if your Body damage would be higher? No, Gun Fu attacks pick whichever amount of damage dice is higher between the gun and your Body. (Note: When I read Gun Fu, it sounds like it caps at the gun damage, so I understand the confusion, but James has consistently said it's whichever damage is higher across other Mayor's Desks so I'm 100% sure that's what they really mean)

* More on martial arts resolutions requiring brawling attacks: thematically, mixing brawling attacks in is supposed to represent how martial arts styles have simpler strikes, which are brawling, and then more targeted strikes, which are martial arts. 

* Inner Chrome's description has been updated to be clearer. [See what has changed here.](https://rtalsoriangames.com/2025/05/28/interface-red-volume-4-is-updated-physical-prints-coming-soon/)

* Does a prehensile cyberfoot from Interface 3 count as an arm for Multiarm Melee? At first they say no, but at 44:50 James clarifies that yes, a prehensile cyberfoot in hand mode does count as an arm for Multiarm Melee.

* How many extra melee attacks granted by resolutions, per turn, were intended? James says he has yet to see us come up with anything that was not intended. Maybe this means we aren't theorycrafting hard enough. ""Have no fear, even though it's a very complicated system with a lot of moving parts, there are 'math guardrails' that will protect you from horrible game states."" -James Hutt

**43:58 to 47:28**

* Can extra attacks granted by resolutions make aimed shots? No, unless the description of the special move says you can. This is a rule from core RED's martial arts section. 

* When does Kung Fu Superior Stance take effect? Is it the current round, or the following round? Would the initiative queue continue from where you were, or where you are? It happens on the next round. You don't get another turn on the same round, but you can have two turns in a row if you start out at the bottom of initiative and use Superior Stance to get to the top of initiative for the next round.

* What is the DV for Borg Fist? If it doesn't specify a DV, martial arts resolutions are vs. the target's dodge. Borg Fist is an attack vs. the target's evasion.

**47:37 to 52:55**

* Contact Combat's description has been updated to be clearer.

* [The May 2nd Mayor's Desk question about EMP effects](https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkred/comments/1kdn2af/may_2_2025_mayors_desk_summary/) and how this impacts subdermal armor and grafted muscle and bone lace (GMBL) is unclear. The May 2nd Mayor's Desk says an EMP'd GMBL wouldn't lower your body, but would it cause your linear frame to become inoperable? James says this is the GM's call, for now. GMBLs and internal linear frame questions come up frequently. Rob reminds us that hardened shielding will protect you from EMPs, and it's good to have some fear in the game now and then. James reminds us EMPs are already the GM's call because the GM picks which cyberware is hit. 

* Could you simulate ""fanning the hammer"" with handguns from Westerns in RED using a handgun and autofire? James says you could definitely homebrew this if you wanted, such as increasing rate of fire at the cost of not being able to shoot on the next turn. His advice for making homebrew is you want to make sure the homebrew goes in the direction of the game's story and not in the direction of one player's fantasy. Rob and James talk about some more homebrew ideas for fanning the hammer at around 54 minutes to 56 minutes.

* Fossilized Violence, an upcoming different TTRPG R. Talsorian is working on, will come with rules for a 1 player campaign. But as always, they can't go into detail about future releases.

**56:14 to 1 hour 17 seconds**

* Wrestling's Reversal does fulfill the criteria for Silat's Violent Leverage.

* Sov-System is very powerful. 

* Borg Fist is Rate of Fire 1

* The bodyweight autoinjector from Hornet's Pharmacy says it can only be used with street drugs, but on previous Mayor's Desks, they talk about using it with speedheals. What is the intent of the bodyweight autoinjector? What Rob and James mean is, allowing the bodyweight autoinjector to use pharmaceuticals is a very, very popular invented tech upgrade. 

* Could you use the gang jazzler from [12 days of Cybermas](https://rtalsoriangames.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/RTG-CPR-DLC-12DaysofCybermas.pdf) with Wrestling's Chokehold? Yes. James says the gang jazzler is very nasty, and was also nasty in 2020, but he doesn't hear about it getting used a lot. (Note: I personally don't use it because a DV13 RTD is not very high, even taking into account the -2 from the grapple if you have a GM who rules the grapple penalty applies to RTD so it's ""really"" a DV15. It's tough to know what an enemy's RTD might be, if it would even be worthwhile to use.)",6,1749500593.0,cyberpunkred,0,1.0,False

1l7femf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1l7femf/dreamed_about_a_cafe_opening_in_my_university/,Dreamed about a cafe opening in my university courtyard - it opened exactly a week later,"This happened during my first year of university, in the summer — about a week before the resit exam period. I had quite a few exams to catch up on, so I was obviously stressed and mentally drained at the time.

One night, I had this vivid dream: I was sitting in the courtyard of my university, at a table outside a specific café brand that I knew well (I won’t mention the name to avoid promoting it). In the dream, I was drinking coffee, studying, preparing for one of my upcoming exams. At some point, I felt extremely unwell and passed out right there at the table.

It felt so real that I remembered it perfectly after waking up — the colors, the mood, even the layout. The weirdest part is that the café didn’t exist there. The courtyard was just… the usual space, no café at all. I hadn’t been to the university in about 2–3 months since it was summer break, so I hadn’t seen any kind of renovation or construction going on.

Fast forward a few days later — I return to campus to start studying for my resits, and boom: the exact same café (same brand, same vibe) had just opened right there in the courtyard. The placement, the branding, everything matched. In real life, it was a bit smaller than in the dream (only three small tables outside instead of many), but the fact that it was that exact company, in that exact spot, and opened just days after the dream — that really freaked me out.

No one I knew had any idea it was going to open there. There were no signs, no announcements, no hints. And while it’s true I had gone to that café chain with my friends after classes in the past, it never once crossed my mind that they’d open a location inside the university courtyard.

I don’t think it was déjà vu — it felt more like the dream predicted something real that I had absolutely no way of knowing at the time.

Still messes with my head to this day.",2,1749500563.0,Dreams,2,0.76,False

I’ve been feeling pretty lost lately behind in life, behind in academics, and ahead only in self-doubt. I keep thinking I should have it all figured out by now… but I don’t. And maybe you don’t either. Maybe that’s okay.

I’m not here for fleeting chats or curated selfies. I’m hoping to find someone who wants to build something a little more real. Something slow, imperfect, and honest.

Overthinker, coffee addict, occasionally funny when sleep-deprived

Lover of deep conversations, cozy silences, and finding beauty in mundane things

About you?

You don’t need to have it all figured out (actually, it’s better if you don’t)

You miss late-night talks that feel like therapy

You believe in sincerity over aesthetics

You’d rather swap weird confessions, music, book ideas, or even favorite comfort foods than “wyd” texts

Maybe we’ll bond over burnt cookies, unfinished books, or the absurdity of adulthood. Maybe we’ll create our own space to talk about everything and nothing. Maybe we’ll send each other songs that feel like home.

Many months had passed, and we became closer. Mas marami siyang kwento sakin na kinabiliban ko. We discovered that we have so much things in common pagdating sa political stand, belief, iba pang hobbies, paborito namin ang banana que na madalas namin kainin tuwing miryenda, madalas kaming pumunta sa mga coffee shop, and he even took me in Tagaytay. He told me his deepest secret, and I told him mine. Naging komportable ako sa kanya, at ganon di siya sa akin. May mga pagkakataon na napagkakamalan kaming may something dahil palagi kaming magkasama, at sobrang close namin sa isa’t-isa. Andun pa rin yung basic human decency pero nadagdagan, kasi minsan, inaakbayan nya ako, tapos hahawakan nya rin kamay ko, so sinong hindi mafa-fall, diba? Pero hindi ko binibigyan ng meaning ang lahat ng yon, dahil nga alam kong hindi sya straight.



Even if I didn’t imagine before that I’ll be in this situation, I fully acknowledged to myself that I still like him regardless of his gender, and I am enjoying this phase. Not until we stopped talking. Mga two weeks na. And as brick of walls keep on rising between us, there is one other thing that I confirmed at the same time; may gusto sya sa dating may gusto sakin. Nalaman ko to sa common friend namin nung dating may gusto sa akin, at matagal na pala silang magka-usap–and that guy is straight as ruler. 



Natawa ako kasi parang we are all in the same situation; First, binasted ko yung lalaking yon kasi hindi ako interesado sa kanya dahil iba nga ang gusto ko. Second, ako nagkagusto sa kanya. Then third, sya nagkagusto sa never rin naman syang magugustuhan. In other words, pare-parehas kaming talunan.



Pero masakit pa rin pala kahit alam mo na sa una palang, di nya kayang mare-reciprocate dahil hindi katulad ko ang preferred nya. At alam ko na ayun rin yung nararamdaman nya. Kaya some part of me, I want to comfort him. Yung tipong gusto ko syang yakapin kasi alam ko kung ano ang pakiramdam. Kaso, hindi nya rin alam na alam ko yung tungkol don.



As of now, we barely talked. Kung mag-usap man kami, casual na lang. And no, hindi ako umamin. Walang nakakaalam ng nararamdaman ko. It’s just he already found someone, and I was left behind. Pagkakaalam ko, he still messaging that guy. Ewan ko lang kung kamusta sila. Okay lang sana ako kaso inaatake ako ng what ifs. Like, what if sa bandang dulo, ako lang talo kasi silang dalawa naging masaya at nagkatuluyan. And if that happens, I'll be happy (I guess).



But now, yes, I still like him, kahit masakit yon. Di ko rin alam kung paano ako uusad. Haha. Shocks.",1,1749500063.0,MayConfessionAko,0,1.0,False
1l7f6ql,https://www.reddit.com/r/colonoscopy/comments/1l7f6ql/indepth_breakdown_of_my_first_colonoscopy/,In-depth breakdown of my first colonoscopy,"First of all, I want to say that this subreddit was an absolute lifesaver as I went through this process. I don't consider myself a hypochondriac by any means, but definitely had some nerves going through with this for the first time. 

So if you have a question or are nervous, absolutely use this place as a resource. You will almost definitely find a post in here by somebody with a similar experience. And on the off-chance that you don't, post a question and I guarantee it will be answered in minutes.

Obviously the internet can be a scary place, but I was pleasantly surprised to learn that the majority of stories on here are positive ones and everybody is genuinely looking to help others out. So I thought I'd chip in with a breakdown of my experience. 

**Background**

My sister is 44 and had her first colonoscopy a few months ago. She was totally fine, but they removed a couple of polyps so the doctor suggested all of her siblings come in for colonoscopies out of precaution. We are all well under the age of 45 so you can imagine how excited everybody was to receive that on the family text chain...

I am 32yo, good health, minimal history of health issues. I have gone under anesthesia once in my life when I was 13. 

**Diet Leading Up to Prep**

In the two days leading up to prep day, I avoided foods like nuts, seeds, rough veggies and fruits with skin. The instructions that the doctor provided seemed a lot more strict, but the general consensus on here was that you won't run into any issues if you prep properly so I didn't stress it too much.

The night before I started prep, I had chicken breast and white rice around 8pm. This would be my last meal for quite some time but I wanted to keep it bland. 

**The Day Before**

My doctor prescribed SUTAB for my prep. While he said I could have a low-fiber, low-residue breakfast that morning, I opted to skip any food and just have fluids that day. I'm not a big breakfast person so it wasn't that much of a departure from my usual routine.

I opted for tea instead of my normal coffee (even though black coffee is allowed!) to avoid caffeine on an empty stomach. After that, I switched between water and yellow Gatorade in the hours leading up to taking the pills. I drink a ton of water daily, so I didn't have a problem staying hydrated. I would recommend drinking lots of fluids if you're not somebody who normally does that. 

Around 3pm I had some yellow Jello. After fasting for 20 hours, it honestly tasted like the most delicious thing ever. So please be sure to mix in ""treats"" like Jello, gummy bears, Italian Ice and anything else to break up the monotony. 

I had a 10am appointment the next day so I started the SUTAB at 5pm. The pills were average size and I didn't have any issues getting them down, finishing 12 pills in 25 minutes. I followed the instructions to drink 16oz of water a few times after that, then waited for the magic to happen. Since I drink a lot of water normally, I didn't feel ""full"" or oversaturated like others have described. 

Surprisingly, it took every bit of 3 hours for the SUTAB to kick in. I have a pretty active digestive system so I was expecting it to start sooner. I didn't experience any gut discomfort during this time, but I did have a bit of a headache. I don't think it was dehydration since I consumed so many fluids. It wasn't anything terrible, more like a headache you get when you're hungry.  

I have never taken a laxative before so I really didn't know what to expect. But as soon as I felt a rumble in my stomach, I sat on the toilet and it was immediate liquid dispelling from my body. As others have said, it truly feels like you're urinating out of your butt. Nothing uncomfortable or painful whatsoever, just a different feeling.  

I alternated between my bed and the toilet for about 90 minutes, and then the trips became much less frequent. About 3 hours after my first bathroom visit, I felt completely emptied out. 

I would say I went to the bathroom 10 times during that span. The consistency of my stool went from light brown, to dark yellow with flecks, to simply dark yellow. I was a bit concerned because it seemed like some people on here had truly clear waste by the end of their prep and mine was nowhere near clear. I could see through it to the bottom of the bowl, but it definitely wasn't the ""water"" color that others have mentioned.

I knew I had an early wakeup call to take the next 12 pills, so I tried to go to sleep once it felt like my body was done for the night. I sipped water to avoid dehydration but definitely didn't want to overdo it. 

To be honest, I didn't have the greatest night's sleep. Partially because I knew I had an early wakeup call, partially due to nerves. 

**The Morning Of Prep**

I was supposed to take the second of my SUTAB at 5am, but I decided to start 30 minutes earlier at 4:30am to give myself more time to empty out before arriving at the office. If possible, I recommend doing this for peace of mind. 

As others have noted, the pills worked their way through my system much quicker the second time around. About 90 minutes after taking the pills, I started to visit the bathroom. In total, I probably made 12 trips, which was surprisingly more than the first round. 

I was also relieved to see that the color of my stool lightened from a dark yellow the previous night to a light yellow in the morning. It certainly was still not clear, but I felt confident that I had prepped properly. 

The office was about 20 minutes away so even though I felt empty, I sat on the toilet a bit longer just to be safe. Then I took a shower and headed out. 

**Arriving at the Office**

I arrived and checked in at reception. I provided my insurance card, made payment and signed a few forms. Reception confirmed I had a ride home. 

Within minutes, the nurse came back to get me.

**Before the Procedure**

My nerves really started to pick up once they walked me through the facility. Luckily my nurse was very friendly and informative. She had me change out of my clothes and into a hospital gown, then climb into a bed and put a blanket over me. It probably goes without saying but you get completely naked underneath the gown.

When the nurse came back, she put in an IV with fluids. I was worried she would have trouble finding a vein since I was dehydrated, but she was clearly an expert and did so with zero hassle. Next, she took my vitals. Lastly, she asked quite a few medical questions - probably 25 in total. Some were personal, ie: the color of your last bowel movement.

Once she was done, she sent in the anesthesiologist. This guy looked maybe 25 years old but was super friendly as well. He told me that he would be administering Propofol and it would be ""the best nap of my life"". He asked me to sign a few forms digitally and then said he would see me soon. 

Lastly, my gastroenterologist stopped by to say hello. He noted the only 3 people in the room with me would be him, the anesthesiologist and a technician. Overall, everybody seemed to go out of their way to make me feel comfortable. I think they recognize that it can be a stressful situation.

It was probably 20 minutes from the moment I changed into the hospital gown to the moment the tech came by and wheeled me down the hall to the operating room.

**The Procedure**

Once I arrived in the room, I could hear a bunch of machines and saw both of my doctors. I feel like my heart rate definitely started to spike due to adrenaline and nerves at this point. 

My gastroenterologist asked me to turn on my side and get comfortable. Once I did, the anesthesiologist checked on me again and I told him I was all good. He then informed me that he was going to inject the Propofol. He said, ""You're going to feel a warm fuzzy feeling in your arm in a second. Sweet dreams.""

Once that warm and fuzzy feeling hit me, I distinctly remember my last thought being, ""I wonder how long this is going to take to kick in..."" 

The next thing I remember is waking up in recovery.

**Recovery**

The nurse gently called my name to wake me up. I was a bit groggy at first, but eventually got my bearings. It really does feel like you just woke up from a really long nap in the middle of the day, so you're a bit disoriented. 

The nurse offered me something to eat and drink. I accepted a water and blueberry muffin, and it was the best tasting muffin of my life. She then said I could get changed out of the gown and back into my clothes whenever I was ready. I relaxed for 5 minutes and then got changed. 

I felt a bit bloated and gassy, and even though the nurse said I should feel free to fart during recovery, I didn't take her up on the offer. I did ask to use the restroom and let a few loose in there, which helped me feel less bloated. 

My gastroenterologist stopped by and said, ""I've got the two best 6-letter words for your results: ""boring"" and ""normal"". See you in 5 years."" The amount of relief I felt when he said that was almost as good as the Propofol!

Once the nurse confirmed my ride was in the waiting room, she walked me out. My ride asked where I wanted to stop and eat. But surprisingly I was not hungry, so she drove me straight home.

I took a 2hr nap when I got home. Once I woke up, I was absolutely famished. I walked to a local diner alone and ordered a burger, fries and a milkshake. It was absolutely delicious. I was nervous it was too rich for a ""first meal"", but didn't feel any adverse effects.

By about 3pm, I felt completely normal. No fatigue, no drowsiness. 

**The Day(s) After**

I would say the only side effect the day after my colonoscopy was a slight feeling of being bloated. I was probably a bit gassier than normal, but it wasn't anything egregious. My appetite was fully back after that first meal.

Two days after, the feeling of being bloated was almost entirely gone.

Three days after, I had my first bowel movement. I normally take gummy Metamucil so I think that  helped kick-start things. But it is true that you probably won't have a movement for a few days after the procedure and that's normal. 

**Wrapping Up**

All in all, the fasting and prep is \*by far\* the worst part about this entire ordeal. But even that is manageable as long as you follow the instructions. And to only have to endure that for 24hrs once every 5 years in exchange for peace of mind of your health is well worth it. 

I hope some of you found this informative. If it eases at least one person's anxiety and stress leading up to their first colonoscopy, then it was well worth it! ",11,1749500061.0,colonoscopy,0,1.0,False
1l7f6c9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l7f6c9,Review - Recent 5 Night Stay at Hotel Mousai South Puerto Vallarta,"Just got back from a 6 day stay at Hotel Mousai - South Tower. We arrived Sunday and left Friday. Full disclosure I have stayed at a plenty of high-end resorts and hotels but this was my first all-inclusive experience. I’m a 40yr male from the Northeast US to give you an idea of what my experience was. My fiancé booked it directly through the website and she selected it off online reviews. This is reaching into what would be considered the slow season and with the weather the last day we were there I can see why.

**COST:** All in USD

* Booked through Mousai website directly - $4140 for room and all-inclusive package
* $345 for all our gratuity total (we tipped 20% at dinner, 25% for the two higher end meals and 10% on drink tabs). Probably another $80 in random gratuity for bellman, porter, cleaners, concierge, etc. I know that might be a lot compared to what I've read but it's one of our money dials. Tipping for excellent service.
* $110 private transport to and from PVR (New suburban, private driver)
* $140 Spa services + gratuity for the therapists and the hydro guide.

**OVERALL PROS:** Service was amazing, the room was freshened regularly and immaculately cleaned. We opened up our unit all the way in the morning and our whole room accidentally got covered in moisture afterwards due to the difference in temp and humidity. It was literally spotless and perfect when we got back. The make up button was always cleared before we came back. The property at Mousai is incredible. The food was spectacular as was the service.  
  
**ONLY CONS:** There weren’t many. From start to finish there was maybe one hiccup from a food or service side of things. The biggest issue I had with the entire trip… there are two towers being actively constructed next to and behind the current Mousai towers. There was construction noise from around 8am to 6pm almost every day. It was incredibly distracting the first day or two then it kind of faded into the rest of the property noise. The rooms are very quiet though but you can still hear it faintly. If you are outside, you will be able to hear it. If it’s quiet where you are it will be extremely noticeable. It was awful during the outdoor wellness sessions. The towers will not collectively be finished for another 2-3 years so expect heavy construction noise for at least another 2 years until the finishing work starts.  
  
The house music on the roof pools got tiring after a while but it did drown out the construction noise. I don’t need to feel like I’m in a club for 2 hours every time I want to visit a pool. The family pool areas weren't like that.  
  
You do feel like you get sold to at times even while on an AI package. The up charged steak house, events etc. It was hot and heavy for the first 24 hours and then it faded. No one ever pressured us to order items at the restaurants that weren’t included though. Just events. Vallarta Adventures is linked somehow to Tafer Properties I’m sure.  
  
**Airport Arrival -** Book private transpo to the resort if you can. Full sized Suburban, comfortable temp. GREAT drive and welcoming VIP treatment. The communal transport / taxi line was massive even for the slightly offseason and we were guided right to the car. Someone will pull you aside while your driver is getting selected before you leave the terminal. You get a nice cold cheap margarita shot and the person there will try and sell you on a 75 minute presentation for Tafer Residence Club. I negotiated the spa package ""thank you"" down to $140 for the 50 min couples massage and 1 hr hydrotherapy session for both of us. Paid cash, was able to put the spa services on a card after the presentation was over at the resort. If you do this keep a copy of your receipt from the airport.

**Arrival to Mousai -** Bellman immediately greeted us, asked us our names and when our check in was. We were at the counter for about 10 minutes confirming everything including reservation, our car service, a private sailing trip we booked ahead of time and to learn more about the resort. I walked over and spoke with the concierges present Miguel and Lissette and they were incredibly welcoming. Cold aromatherapy towel and sparkling wine at check in was nice. We were early and were guided up to the rooftop pool for drinks while we waited. We didn't check in fully until our room was ready, our server notified us of our room number and our tab was added to the AI bill. We were able to get to our room right at our check in time. We were shown to our room where our bags were waiting and the butler showed us the room and asked us if we had any questions or needed anything else. I got my sunscreen confiscated by TSA (duh me. Totally my fault) and the butler brought us some to use for the day until we could get down to the resort shop at Garza Blanca.

**Room -** Slightly cheesy for my tastes but it was wonderfully appointed. 4th floor corner suite. Spotless condition, fresh guac and chips snack was waiting for us. The room was large, big comfortable king bed, seating area, desk, and large bathroom with an oversized shower w/ bench. Everything is pretty much under a year old. The ipad controls are great and you can connect your phone or tablet to the room to play your own music or select from their lists. ***Good to know:*** your button panel at the door is your privacy and there is a ""make up"" button that will turn your room icon green in the hallway to note that you'd like the room cleaned up or things taken away. I think I missed the butler telling us this when we checked in. The outdoor wrap around patio has a tile jacuzzi that is hot on arrival, two loungers, a hammock and two oversized chairs.

**Upper Property Mousai Adults Only (Towers area) -** Immaculately clean. Very much more ""jungle"" than beach like Garza Blanca. I'm an early riser and from the east coast and I can tell you, the entire property is  
basically spit polished every morning. There's an army of people sweeping, cleaning and prepping everything. I sat in AWE each morning with my coffee watching how many people there were maintaining and cleaning. The south tower has a rooftop pool that is open at 11am and stays open late. Noi (italian) is  
on the main floor and was our breakfast spot. At night there's a piano player in the lobby who is magnificent and much more enjoyable than the music at the other dining areas for dinner that we went to. It's a short walk between to the North tower and DAO (chinese) restaurant is in the middle. North has a better pool IMO but had more premium spots reserved. There are pics of both. North also has a better unobstructed ocean view. The other restaurant in the upper level of the resort is there too, Hiroshi (Japanese fusion). The food and drink offerings at both roofs is the same. Service at both was exceptional. The music was a bit much at times. I love house music, but 5 straight days of it mixed in with yacht rock was starting to get to me after a while.

**Remainder of the Property (Terra Luna, Garza Blanca) –** Terra Luna Gardens is gorgeous and has probably what I can only describe as the best outdoor spots for yoga and sound bath meditations I have ever been in. Excellent check in service and treatment for the two events I attended. The sound bath alone in any normal instance would easily be a $100 or more experience and is included. Terra Luna at night is wonderful to walk through and a fun little (albeit expensive) shopping experience for high end items. There’s a gelato bar and their new Karuma grill which is all ages. They offered us a meal there at a discount for a tasting menu but we already had all our reservations booked and it’s not part of the all inclusive package at all.  
  
You can trolly between everything. If you are going to Terra Luna from Mousai, take the path. Do not try and walk up or down the sidewalk on the road. This goes for the whole resort. There are gorgeous paths and steps everywhere. You won’t regret it and my partner and I enjoyed the walks so much.  
  
Garza Blanca has Blanca Blue (Mexican), Bocados (American Steakhouse) and Aquazul (similar to the rooftop menu but more family oriented). You can easily walk from the towers to Bocados and you should. It’s an excellent walk. We also walked down to Garza for everything we needed and took the trolly back up. If it’s slow they will just chauffer you up in a nice van. There were no pool spots at either the Inifinty pool or the Panorama pool when we walked by, the beach was very easy to get seating set up. We wanted the adults only vibe so we stayed up in the tower area for most things.  
  
**The Beach –** In true PV style, it’s smaller and there’s a lot of rocks on the one side but it’s a beach on the water. If you’re looking for a big beach place and to spend every waking hour at the beach, go somewhere else. Food and drinks were good. Better than the upper pool in some instances a more authentic Mexican than others. There’s water sports accessories there to rent. The water was choppy for the day we spent down there so we just popped in and out of the water to our chairs and had lunch. Really good ceviche.  
  
**Food –** I’ll break down each restaurant separately but the food overall is magnificent. We made all our reservations about a month in advance and verified all of them at check in. The concierge, Miguel (he’s amazing) gave us a whole itinerary when we checked in even for the offsite things we were doing.  
  
Try to order differently and explore. Ask your servers for recommendations. We got recs for each meal and let them know we would like to stay on the AI side of meals and drinks. Every server understood and recommended things I don’t know if I ever would have ordered. The service at all the spots was excellent and we were treated well everywhere we went. The only place that was a bit lackluster was Blanca Blue for our first night as my entrée didn’t come out initially. It was worth the wait. I will say that I do not have a strong stomach for spice and almost everything I ate was flavorful and not overly spicy. The food is Americanized but there’s always sauces on the side to kick things up if you want. My partner is ½ Mexican and she was also incredibly happy with every meal.  
  
There’s dress codes for each spot for each part of the day. Don’t show up in a swimsuit and flip flops and you’ll be fine for most dinners. Sadly, the menus online for some spots are out of date so I’ll try and remember what I got at each place. We split pretty much everything to eat our way through what we could without wasting a bunch of food. HOLY SH\*T the amount of food people waste at AI’s shocked me.

***Blanca Blue*** **–** ***All Ages*** **Main area of Garza Blanca.** Very good. Not as amazing as the others but it’s pretty much oceanside and the layout was fun. Probably my least favorite of the 4 meals we had on site, not saying it’s bad by any means though. My main was a short rib in a soft blue corn pouch with pink mole. Incredibly well done and tasted great.

***Bocados*** **–** ***All Ages*** **(maybe it’s Boca Dos? It’s kind of confusing)** Traditional American steakhouse vibe with a twist. It’s in the middle of the property and an easy 5-10 minute walk from the South tower. Also, not adults only. You need to walk through the North Tower to get there and go through the bar where they hold the tequila tasting. Neat spot. As someone who loves a good steak the food was excellent but not what I would consider top shelf steakhouse like some I’ve been to in bigger cities. The food was excellent though. Aged strip, tenderloin, wedge salad, mussels, prosciutto and burrata salad. Mushrooms, spinach and street corn on the side with several sauces.

***NOI – Adults South Tower***  We live in an area with insanely good Italian so we skipped dinner here. Had breakfast though and it was spectacular. Try all the traditional Mexican dishes you can for breakfast. We did sit in the lobby every night after stumbling into the piano player getting set up. We would sit and have a drink before dinner. Highly recommend. He’s the best musician on the property and probably one of the most stellar pianists I have ever witnessed.  
  
Breakfast items I loved were the Nature’s Caress and the Berry Sip smoothies. The Chilaguiles and Machaca were great but the best food we had here was the Enfrijoladas and Enmoladas. Get them with a fried egg and avocado. Amazing. Skip the bread / pastries. Save the room for something better. This was also some of the best wait staff and service I have ever had at any restaurant I have ever been to.  
  
You can also get quick coffee here every morning and you don’t have to sit down. It essentially operates as the coffee shop if you don’t want to use the Nespresso machine in your room.  
  
**DAO –** ***Adults Area*** Pretty much tied with Hiroshi as my favorite. Much different vibe from the rest of the spots in the whole resort. Incredible food and stellar service. If you’re a sake person, the SCB was the only decent option included. There are very good options that are extra. Crab Rangoon wonton, crispy duck salad, shrimp potsticker, steamed catch of the day, and on recommendation the chef’s Hor Fun w/ Chicken. Insane. All of it. Rivaled some of the Chinese food I’ve eaten in Flushing.  
  
**Hiroshi –** ***Adults Area North Tower*** Incredible meal. Overlooks the ocean between the two Garza Blanca towers if you get the right table. Just eat everything. Chocolata clams flambeed in the shell at the table, Yuzu Salmon, Black Lapa, Tako roll, so much Nigiri but the catch of the day was a local pacific white fish. Amazing. Stellar service once again. Tough to say which was better but I’d have to say this was the best meal we ate on the property.  
  
**Roof Pools –** Like I said before, the north roof is bigger with a better view and cabanas. Menus are the same at both. Service was excellent and the drinks were great whether we ordered off the menu or from the cocktail menu. The mocktails were also a good break on the 3^(rd) and 4^(th) day. I can only drink so many margaritas and cocktails. There are always spots reserved for elite members but it being the offseason it was not hard for us to settle in any day or time.  
  
The south pool deck is open for late night drinks and we had a lot of fun hanging out there and meeting people.  
  
**Spa –** Wonderful experience and service. I'm big on spas and will almost always find one on vacation. The hydrotherapy essentially dissolved my hangover. The massage was wonderful, and the spa is quiet and serene. It has an insane view of the pacific as it’s two floors below the roof top pool deck. I was not able to hear any noise from the roof at all. The staff for the couples massage was awesome. The only downside of the whole spa experience was the construction noise that was present at times throughout my massage in that room only.  
  
R**oom Service -** Food was great. Late night bites are very American drunk food type stuff. We had lunch in, breakfast on our outdoor area and late-night bites. The in-room bar for all-inclusive is an off brand reposado tequila that was passable, Jack Daniels, Belvedere and a Cabernet. There’s some beer options as well. Getting ice or food was simple through the ipad and there are also cocktails. We didn’t wait more than 15-20 minutes for any food at any hour.  
  
**Overall Service –** I was slightly worried after reading reviews that the service might not be exceptional. I could not have been more wrong. Anything we needed we just kindly asked for. Kindness and candor go a long way. I saw people occasionally treating the staff poorly, but I couldn’t really imagine why. I even asked specifically that I was really trying to dive in and speak mostly Spanish while I was there and even though I’m an obviously looking white male, each person we met was on point and was very patient with me and helped when they could. The rooftop guys are awesome, every waiter, hostess, busser, porter, bellman etc was incredibly gracious and kind. We needed a few rides to places, in to town etc. Cars were scheduled, taxis, etc. Turn down service was nightly and they set music in our room, closed our light shades, removed and replaced wet towels.  
  
**75 Min Presentation – I**t was actually enjoyable to learn about the property, the plan etc. It’s a residence club, not a timeshare which is not wholly that different but we moved through it quickly. I have been through timeshare presentations but never one for the style of what they’re doing. We got to see two gorgeous rooms in the Garza tower. They pitched it, it’s mathematically difficult on purpose but we ate breakfast with the tour guide at Bocados which we got to eat off their normal AI menu and not the pitched tour buffet.  
  
All in, I think it took about 2:30 hours which is what we spent at the spa the next day. Worked out for us IMO. Our normal spa bill would have been around $650 which I negotiated down to $140 at the airport. We also got a free bottle of what looks like decent reposado tequila and it was cool to learn about the property and the plans for it in case we decide to go back. I’m not ever going to buy into a residence club so it was easy. Wasn’t really hard sold but there was of course a secondary offer at a lower price point. There are lots of members and I’m sure the busy prime months get flooded with them. One couple we sat next to at the pool had the top tier membership level and like 16000 points but he uses it as a rental investment and stays almost solely at Tafer properties whenever they go on vacation. There’s places popping up apparently in the DR and I want to say maybe Costa Rica?

the thing is that i was really thinking about her on this first week away and decided to reached yesterday with a pic of a coffee shop from her hometown, asking how she was

she commented on the pic and sent me a pic of her on the beach, saying she's been enjoying the sun a lot. then, after a few minutes, she sent me a one time view pic of her with friends coming home after a party and asked, with curiosity, how my week has been

so far, so good

but i got myself feeling stupid for reaching out when, rationally, i know i shouldn't be investing into this. moreover, i feel icky toward myself for initiating communication so soon and now i just want to disappear, honestly

bc of this emotional reaction, i'm gonna back alllll the way now and keep focusing on meeting ladies where i'm at

but would like to hear what you guys would do in such situation, so i don't make the same mistakes next time",2,1749499955.0,LeoAstrology,12,1.0,False
