1gh0gww,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleep/comments/1gh0gww/do_i_just_have_to_accept_im_not_good_at_sleep/,Do I just have to accept I’m not good at sleep after a while?,"I’m 33, M and I’ve had sleep problems for years now. I can get to sleep but I never sleep very long and I feel tired a lot throughout the day. 

I’ve been to the doctors a lot and no matter how many times I go they say the same thing: less caffeine, less phones, more exercise etc. 

I have structured my life around trying to get good sleep for almost half a year now and it’s still the exact same.

I’ve never drank caffeine. I don’t drink tea or coffee, just water, or soda water with a diluting juice.

Wake up at 6am every day, go for a walk as soon as I’m up before I shower and start work. I generally always hit my exercise and move goal on my watch. I do at least 30-60 minutes walking each day, and gym 3 times a week.

I eat home made, fairly healthy meals with lots of fruit and veg, don’t eat after my dinner which is around 6pm. 

Since I do exercise I’m not overweight and don’t have any health issues. 

I don’t look at my phone after 8pm and read a book for an hour before I go to sleep. Go to bed about 8:30pm/9pm and read until I feel sleepy about 10pm.

I’ve made sure I don’t sleep in a hot room, so temperature wise I’m fine.

I take magnesium glycate and L-theanine to help with sleep. 

I really do everything I can, and yet most nights I’m lucky to clock 30 minutes deep sleep, and I still don’t get good sleep.

I sleep solidly from 10pm to 2am, but then I wake up and feel wide awake. It takes me about 30-40 minutes but I eventually get back to sleep but constantly toss and turn for the next 4 hours, waking up all the time before I finally get out of bed at 6am for work, feeling exhausted. 

It’s driving me crazy because my work involves further qualifications that I need to study additional math/stats for, and I don’t have the energy to study after work as I’m exhausted constantly. Weekends are a bit better as I can study during the day when I’m a bit more alert, but with an average of 4 hours proper sleep, I feel tired most of the time. 

Last night for Halloween I was looking forward to watching a horror movie after work but I was so tired I just went to bed at half 8, and woke up at 1am and that was me for the rest of the night. Tried to force myself to sleep until 7am but I was just rolling around not sleeping and now it’s 8am and I’m exhausted again.

Sorry if this seems like a rant. I’m just fed up of revolving almost my entire night around getting a good sleep routine and just feeling constantly exhausted. 

I should note I’ve had blood tests a few years ago but they didn’t reveal anything out of the ordinary. ",1,1730448676.0,sleep,0,1.0,False

**Introduction**

I’m Luc, a 22y/o from Central Europe, looking for a new RP partner around my age. I am looking to create a strong, longterm connection and build an interesting story with you. So far, I’ve only dabbled in realistic settings and SoL stories but I’m open to try out something new — I’m very much open to any ideas you might have.

**A few requirements**

* You’re willing to role-play on Discord.
* You're open to get to know each other via OOC.
* You’re okay with me writing in past 3rd tense.
* You don’t just write one- or two-liners but if you put effort into your paragraphs.
* You’re somewhat literate and have good grammar.
* You’re patient (my life’s quite busy at the moment, I don’t get to write that often)

&#x200B;

**Ideas to get the creative juices flowing:**

*Romance/Drama*

* Two strangers meet and sparks fly (e.g. at the airport, coffee shop, library, bar, …)
* Two longtime friends fall for each other and try to keep their relationship a secret
* Enemies-to-lovers tropes

*Fantasy (new territory for me)*

* Real-world setting with fantasy elements (e.g. supernatural beings disguised as humans are watching over our world; person with special powers stranded in our world; …)
* Adventure hero-stories in a full-on fantasy world (would need a lot of planning since I don’t have any lore ready at this point)

>\>> *Romance isn’t a must in these types of stories but if it fits the story line, it could certainly be a part of it. Again: I’m also open for other suggestions you might have!*

Couple of days ago i saw these 2 identical lines on my front teethes.  
Sadly any all pictures i take doesn't capture how it looks in real life.  
Hopefully you can see that on my right tooth there is a line straight from the middle and all the way down & same does it on my left tooth sadly you can't see that because of the picture.

I don't smoke or drink, I rarely drink soda.  
I do drink Coffee & Tea.

I have done my own reseach for abit and heard this was ""Craze lines"" is that the case in this situation?

Your layout will depend on the size of the room, how you use it, and the unique features you want to highlight. Whether your living room is small and cozy or large and open, choosing the right [living room furniture](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture/living-room-furniture) and arranging it effectively can transform the space. Here, we’ll explore layouts for various room sizes and lifestyles and the essential pieces that bring each setup together, from the perfect [side table for living room](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture/living-room-furniture/side-tables) cohesion to the ideal [coffee table for living room](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture/living-room-furniture/coffee-tables) centerpiece.

**1. Layouts for Small Spaces: Maximizing Functionality**

In a smaller living room, every piece of furniture needs to be intentional. Here’s how to create a layout that maximizes space without sacrificing style:

Compact Seating: Opt for a loveseat or a smaller sectional rather than a large sofa. Place it against a wall to free up floor space.

Multi-functional Side Table for Living Room Use: Select a side table with built-in storage or a nesting design. These allow you to tuck extra tables away when not needed, creating a flexible surface for books, drinks, or decor.

Coffee Table with Storage: Choose a coffee table with built-in storage compartments. This type of coffee table for living room needs serves as a central focal point while providing hidden storage for remotes, magazines, or blankets.

This setup prioritizes functionality with a streamlined aesthetic, perfect for cozy, intimate gatherings.

**2. Layouts for Open-Concept Living Rooms: Defining Zones**

An open-concept living room allows for an airy and spacious feel, but it also requires a clear definition of spaces to avoid feeling too open. Here's a layout strategy to achieve that balance:

Sectional Sofa as a Divider: Position a sectional sofa to divide the living area from adjacent spaces, like the dining or kitchen area.

Complementary Side Tables: Use side tables on either end of the sofa to create symmetry. Choose side tables that match the style of the coffee table for a cohesive look.

Statement Coffee Table: Anchor the seating area with a large, statement coffee table. For open-concept spaces, a bold coffee table for living room use can serve as an attention-grabber and visually center the area.

This layout is ideal for families who love to entertain, offering flexibility for larger gatherings without compromising on flow or style.

**3. Layouts for Formal Living Rooms: Elegance and Comfort**

For those who enjoy a touch of formality, arranging furniture in a way that promotes conversation is key. A formal layout is all about symmetry and elegant finishes:

Classic Sofa Pairing: Place two identical sofas facing each other, creating a structured, balanced look that invites conversation.

Ornate Side Tables: Incorporate side tables on either end of each sofa to hold elegant lamps or decorative accents, adding a touch of sophistication.

Stylish Coffee Table: In a formal living room, a marble or glass coffee table for living room elegance makes for a refined centerpiece. A statement coffee table pairs well with a formal layout, adding a polished look to the space.

This setup is perfect for homeowners who want a luxurious yet inviting living room where they can entertain guests in style.

**4. Family-Friendly Layouts: Functional and Durable**

In a busy household, the living room serves multiple purposes, from a play area to a movie night spot. Here’s how to create a layout that can handle it all:

Durable Seating with Easy-Clean Fabrics: Opt for a sectional with stain-resistant fabric. Sectionals provide ample seating and are great for lounging, movie nights, or hosting guests.

Rounded Side Table for Living Room Safety: Rounded side tables reduce the risk of sharp corners, making them ideal for homes with children.

Storage-Friendly Coffee Table: Choose a coffee table with drawers or lift-top storage to keep toys, remotes, and other items organized and out of sight.

This layout is family-focused, offering practicality and comfort while maintaining a warm, welcoming aesthetic.

**5. Multi-Functional Layouts: Office and Lounge in One**

For those working from home, combining a home office with the living room layout is a smart solution. Here’s how to make it both productive and cozy:

Compact Desk in a Corner: Place a small desk in one corner, ideally near a window for natural light.

Side Table as a Workspace Extension: Use a side table for living room work essentials, like a lamp or small filing system, keeping the workspace organized without clutter.

Functional Coffee Table: Opt for a coffee table that can double as a work surface. Adjustable-height coffee tables for living room setups can serve as both a casual desk and a stylish focal point.

This layout is ideal for remote workers or freelancers who want a living room that adapts to their needs throughout the day.

**Final Thoughts**

Whether your living room is a place to unwind, entertain, or multitask, the layout should reflect your lifestyle and enhance the space’s functionality. By thoughtfully choosing living room furniture, like the right sofa, side table, or coffee table, you can create a layout that not only meets your needs but also exudes personal style. Each piece serves a purpose, from providing storage to adding style and symmetry, ultimately crafting a living room layout that feels both welcoming and uniquely yours.",1,1730447509.0,u_homeandsoul,0,1.0,False

1gh048f,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1gh048f/the_concept_of_deserving_something_is_so_foreign/,The concept of deserving something is so foreign to me,"I’m sure this is a common thing but I just have to write my thoughts away or I might not get to sleep tonight…

I was watching a video from hybrid calisthenics titled “building the foundation for long term change”. 

Immediately before I clicked on the video, sirens were going off. I knew whatever was contained in this 14 minute video was not what my brain wanted. 

It took a few minutes for me to scroll back up and finally watch it, which I only got half way into finishing.

He brought up a topic that resonated with me, and I’m gonna put it into my own words; for there to be a foundation for any sort of change, you (more like, him or I; I think this part is subjective) need to have stable ground. For him, and me as well, that’s stuff like proper sleep, or a proper diet.

If I wake up at 4pm and go eat breakfast, it’s a simple fact that I won’t brush my teeth after. I may not even eat another meal that day. 

But if I wake up at 7,8 hell maybe even 11, I might even make myself tea or coffee, and I’ll brush my teeth once I’m finished!

Simply put, you can’t build a house off an empty stomach and a 30 minute nap, and you sure as hell won’t want to if you’re stressed about a hundred other things going on.

Maybe I took it differently, but the word stress in that context meant something else to me. 

It didn’t feel like the typical work stress, and I don’t have the words to describe it but it felt more like a deeply ingrained, ever-active sort of fight/flight/freeze response. Maybe that’s exactly what it is. 

But all of my struggles these past couple of months can be boiled down to that animalistic, freeze like stress response. 

This realization sent me down a bit of a rabbit hole.

I’ve long lost where I’ve made the connection, but I found my way to that train of thought through reading other people’s thoughts on similar experiences.

I think I struggle with simple tasks more than an ordinary person, because I don’t feel I DESERVE the results.

Just the other day, I was coming home from a concert. It was late, I just wanted to get an Uber home and go to bed.

This younger guy picked me up, there was 1 other person since it was a shared ride but I was going a lot further so he was first to get dropped off.

Before we leave the other persons place, he asks if it’s alright to get gas. 

It seemed a bit weird to ask. I’m not gonna walk home, why would I have an issue?

I tell him not to worry about it, no need to apologize. The nearest gas station was maybe 5 minutes away, he pulls up quick, gets out, tries to pump it and shortly after gets back in; the pumps were closed.

Again he asks if it’s alright to find another, and again, I’m put off a bit. It doesn’t bother me in the slightest and he’s been more polite than any other person I’ve ridden with, so I tell him that’s fine. Another 5 minutes and we get there, finally he can fill his car up, and we get back on the road.

It’s another 30 minutes until we get home, and it was pretty quiet. He was on the phone with someone so I didn’t want to bother him at all, but we get to my front door, and what he said kind of shocked me…

He thanked me for my patience, and told me to have a good night. 

It just felt so STRANGE. Why would I stop him from pumping gas? Why would it be a problem only after he couldn’t the first time? I’m in his car, if he has to get gas than by all means he’s within every right to do so without question. 

Maybe I was in a good mood from the concert, but I don’t think that’s it since honestly my legs were hurting, my neck was stiff, and I was TIRED. I didn’t want to nap in the car because call me weird lol but… I don’t know the guy. And I certainly wouldn’t want to take his precious time by having to wake me; he’s working after all. 

It felt unnecessary but it showed the kind of person he was, so I made sure to tip him generously.

Thinking back on that moment, the connection was made.

Have I EVER felt like I truly deserved something? Not my own made up definition, but seriously deserving of something? 

I don’t think I have. I cherish the moments where I do feel loved or cared for, maybe a bit more than I should, but never in the moment or anytime after do I feel I was worthy of that; it feels like that’s just a part of life. These things come and go, they’re rare to pop up so I desperately cling on to what I can.

In fact, instead of feeling like I did deserve something, I usually feel like I DONT if I’ve ruminated on it long enough, which is inevitable. 

If something happens I’m just gonna think about it until that warm feeling it gave me dies out, and I’m left with just the memory, which when not tied to an emotion gets warped into my brains own messed up perception.

So with that whole rant behind me…
I can’t even begin to fathom what it feels like to deserve something. It simply feels too selfish to imagine things like that.",2,1730446968.0,CPTSD,1,1.0,False

“Let’s not, kay?” Blaine said, crouching over Tah’li and igniting the fire in one palm as he did. Looking up at Narah, he added, “We’re better than that.” 



Narah’s eartips went deep blue, and she looked away guiltily. Blaine healed Tah’li, and helped her stand up. Then he addressed them both. 



“Whatever you two have previous, I don’ give a ripe shit. Y’all are gonna sit perty, lest I lay down a whoopin’ mah self! Nahw, ‘tis a birthday party, didn’ yeh hears? Tah’li, you pull a stunt like that again, an’ I ain’t callin’ Narah orff. I’ll join in!” Blaine said, his face angry, and stern. Tah’li nodded, and sat back down gingerly. Narah’s eyes were still bright orange with the slightest tint of green, and she watched Tah’li’s neck with yearning. 



Smitch watched with awe, and said nothing. His black eyes gave away little, and his face was the picture of stunned astonishment. When he finally did speak, the silence had become almost unbearably long. 



“That’s why I chose to stay out of it.” Smitch said. 



“Huh?” Narah said, distracted. 



“You’re a scary woman, Narah Sihn. But your human… Our Emperor… Sorry, Sire, but you terrify me.” Smitch concluded. 



“Nah, I jus’ fake it really well.” Blaine said, chuckling darkly.



“Even I wouldn’t have seen that legsweep coming… And I’m Shagur! I can see the future … Well, ten seconds ahead, anyways. There’s no winning against you in hand-to-hand combat.” Smitch said, shrugging. 



“Why?” Blaine said, suddenly intrigued. 



“You don’t formulate the plan, you flow with the energy of the action. There’s no future… Just, the present.” Smitch said, with the same shocked look of before. 



“Huh… I never figured that’s why I could beat a Shagur in a fight…. Interestin’... “ Blaine said, running his fingers through his hair.



Narah continued to stare at Tah’li’s neck, oblivious to what Smitch was saying. Blaine sat forwards into her field of view. 



“Babe… You aight?” Blaine said.



“Yeah.” Narah said, looking up at his eyes and mouth. “Sorry.” 



Blaine sighed, and pulled out his money. “How much do I owe yeh?” He asked the bartender. 



“Twelve farthing.” The bartender said. 



Blaine counted out the large gold coins, and then stood up, sliding them across the bar to the hostess. “Thanks. See you on Valance.” 



The bartender nodded, winking. “Yes, Sire! I look forward to it!” 



Blaine finished his drink, and then grabbed Narah by her upper arm, steering her out of the bar. Narah looked at him like as if she was disgusted by his actions. Blaine held his tongue until they made  it outside and the door shut, before he spoke. 



“You need to learn to let old fires die. Ain’t not one good fuckin’ reason fer all that, an’ you know it!” Blaine said, glaring at Narah. “This is the lesson, I’m sure, that the Ancestors was leadin’ me to teach. Let’s take a walk, to Valkiri Academy’s archives, shall we? You got some highly classified history books to read!” He said, angrily turning to look through the glass on the door of the bar again, huffily. All he could see was the glare of reflection from behind him on the glass. 



Narah stared at him, hurt showing on her face. “I’m sorry.” She said in a quiet tone. “*HEHHHM!* What books?” She added, clearing her throat and blinking rapidly.



“C’mon…” Blaine said, turning around and walking past her towards the main street. “It’s a long walk. I want you to see I ain’t lyin’ when I recount this. Cause the last time I talked about.. The last time I talked about the Boop, I was sugar-coatin’ shit.” Blaine said, with a grimace of disgust. “You need teh see the truth. Politickin’ caused the fissures in cohesion and unity in our society, making us ripe fer the pickin’. An’ We were blind to the real threat… That Ackarn an’ Corra, an’ Kel’ze an’ a few others were behin’ it all!” 



“Okay.” Narah said, her ears sagging lightly, and her eyes still watery. “I didn’t realize that you’d ever lied…” 



“Narah, sometimes I lie to protect. That’s the only time, heard?” Blaine said, stopping and waiting for her. 



“Who were you protecting? It couldn’t have been daddy…. He knew. He has always had access to the archives.” Narah said, looking up as she and Blaine started walking down the street to the Academy together.



“You wouldn’ believe me if’n I as told yeh. You need to see fer yerself.” Blaine said. He was enjoying the exercise of the walk, but not the subject matter.

Narah looked at him with a worried glance, as she kept pace with him. “Who” She repeated, nearly tripping and catching herself, as they drew into sight of Valkiri Academy.



“There’s a certain somethin’ about tha’ person, you wouldn’t believe. An’ that’s whah yeh needs teh see it, Narah. You e’r been in the Archives?” Blaine said, as he mounted the first obsidian step to the front of the Academy. 



“Yeah… Years ago at school, was the last time I saw them in any meaningful way… Normally we just get to see the approved references.” Narah replied, scaling the stairs beside him. 



“Then yer ‘bout teh shit.” Blaine said, arriving at the door. 



Narah silently followed through the doorway, intrigued by what could possibly be such profound information that she would have a fecal reaction, not understanding the colloquialism’s use here.



“Sire! Madam Sihn! What may we do for you today?” Penni said from the top of the staircase, as students were quickly ushered into a classroom off the main hall by another woman. 



“Shit… I wanted to do this quiet…” Blaine muttered. “Oh, nothin’ special, Penni! Just takin’ a walk… You know…” Blaine said loudly enough to be heard.



“Oh.. Well, unless you’re here for a reason… We’re in the middle of classes…” Penni said.



“No sweat. We’re not here to disturb tha’...” Blaine shrugged. “Takin’ a meander to the Restricted Section.” 



“Oh..” Penni said, turning pink. She looked around wildly. “Already?” She said, walking down the steps to them.



“Yeah. Already.” Blaine said. 



Penni’s eyes went wide. “Alright. I’ll go call Jupiter, and get Thor on standby. I thought you were going to need all four weeks…” 



“What am I missing?” Narah said. 



“This was the claim I made that got me accused of blasphemy, Narah.” Blaine said. 



“W-wait… You said it was for telling the truth!” Narah said, looking hurt, and on the edge of tears.



“It was.” Penni sighed. “I had a big hand in it, myself.” 



“What did you say?” Narah said, looking at Blaine. “They deleted your video before I had a chance to see it.” 



“Not here!” Penni said, putting a hand on Narah’s shoulder, and grasping Blaine’s arm to stifle the answer on his lips. “Archives, first!” 



“Yeah… Yer right. “ Blaine said with a shrug. “It’s safer. Narah, what you’re about to learn, would kill yer dad. In fact, he’d go to it willin’ly. It’s such a secret, y’all ain’t aware it’s been the case, till I showed up.” 



Blaine and Penni walked Narah to the Archives, realizing she would continue to ask questions, and this wasn’t the place. 



“How did you find out? It’s not like the Archives are digital!” Narah said, as they steered her down the Archival Hall, while Penni sent a quick message from her wristslate.



“The cameras, are.” Blaine retorted. “An’ this is why I didn’ show this teh Mari’a.” 



Renhardt came running furiously down the hall behind them, barely making it to their side before they entered the Archives. Panting desperately and leaning on Blaine’s shoulder, she spoke as she caught her breath.



“Why… Couldn’t… You… Wait?!” Renhardt panted, laying her forehead against Blaine’s shoulder as she fought for air. 



“I could. She cain’t.” Blaine said, pointing at Narah.



Renhardt glanced sidelong at Narah before nodding her understanding. “Shit.. okay… Lemme catch my breath.” Renhardt panted. 



Standing and nursing a stitch in her side, Renhardt walked over to the door and opened it. Two large and impressive creatures stood at either side of the door. The first thing that met Blaine’s mind as he looked at these massive beasts, was Chimerae from Greek mythology. The massive scaly heads which resembled a hairless lion, complete to the massive clublike tail made of a bony plate, and four massive legs with powerful clawed paws. The size, however…. One could be mistaken for crazy, by a rational standard, when hearing a description of their sheer size. Towering as tall as a two story building, the creatures were absolutely terrifying by any standard. 



As physically imposing as they were, they both shrunk from the sight of Renhardt. She held her hand up, and walked toward the nearer of the two, and gently placed a hand on its front leg. The creature realized she wasn’t going to hurt it at that moment, and relaxed. The other slowly walked over and lay down, pawing at the air in a display of submissive playfulness. 



Renhardt patted its scaly hide, and then waved the rest forwards. “These are Garbogs. Tilly and Rascor, our current resident keepers of the gates of Gjoll.” She said. 



Rascor flipped back over on his massive paws and sniffed Blaine, before looking back at Renhardt. She smiled, and Rascor turned back to Blaine, and tucked Blaine into his other leg with a massive paw, purring gently. 



Blaine patted Rascor’s leg, and smiled. “Thank you, my friend.” He said, smiling up at the massive face looming above him. Rascor looked around at Narah, who was literally shaking as she stared up at the creature. Tilly padded up silently, and nuzzled Narah with her head. 



“They literally won’t hurt you, unless they detect you’re not here for a just reason. Also, I’m here. They aren’t a match for me.” Renhardt said. 



Narah relaxed, and patted Tilly’s big head, which at the moment was shoving her around. Tilly grabbed Narah into a hug, and then looked at Penni and growled. Penni put up her hands, and backed away slowly. 



“No.. No.. You go ahead… You’re right, Tilly, I don't need to be here.” Penni said, suddenly terrified. Tilly shook her massive head and shoulders, before stalking back around and through the doors to her bed next to the inside of the door. Rascor stood up and let go of Blaine, and walked back to his bed on the opposite side of the large hall beyond the door. 



The small party walked inside, and the doors shut on a still watching Penni, who was lurking behind as she’d not wanted to test Tilly’s resolve, and Renhardt stayed to keep the Garbogs busy. As Narah and Blaine turned the corner, Narah’s questions were answered, immediately followed by more questions. 



“Hellah.” Narah said quietly, looking across the large building’s open floor at the woman she named.



“Yup.” Blaine said. “The woman behind it all.” 



“Emperor! Heh… the very thought!” Hellah spat, looking up from her seat in front of the large fireplace and small coffee table. “You shouldn’t have ever been! You weren’t supposed to be more than material for an experiment!” 



“You gottah lotta nerve, yeh wily cunt!” Blaine gave right back. “I’d have ne’er been, had yeh left well ‘nuff alone!” 



Narah glared at Hellah for a second, before looking away. As fierce and powerful as Narah had become, Hellah was in a different league altogether. Thor was really the only person she could think of, that might control the woman somehow, and that was because he was her father.

1gh01ru,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_jeffsisme/comments/1gh01ru/what_is_an_rtic_cooler_tumbler_used_for/,What Is an RTIC Cooler Tumbler Used For?,"RTIC cooler tumblers have become a go-to choice for people seeking a high-quality, durable tumbler that keeps drinks at the perfect temperature for hours. Whether you're heading to the office, hitting the trails, or just relaxing at home, an RTIC cooler tumbler offers an ideal way to enjoy your favorite hot or cold beverage. 

  
What are some the stand out?



**Temperature Retention**  
The RTIC tumbler's double-wall, vacuum-insulated stainless steel construction is key to its temperature retention. It can keep drinks cold for up to 24 hours and hot for up to 6 hours, making it a great choice for both iced coffees and hot teas.

**Durability and Design**  
Built to be sturdy and long-lasting, [RTIC cooler tumbler](https://brands.amazrock.com/product/rtic-can-cooler-with-splash-proof-lid-12-oz/) is made from high-grade stainless steel, which resists dents and scratches. 

They often have a sweat-proof exterior, so you won’t have to worry about condensation making the tumbler slippery. This design feature makes it an excellent choice for outdoor activities where durability matters.

**Versatile Usage**  
RTIC tumblers are also practical for daily life beyond outdoor adventures. They fit comfortably in most car cup holders, making them a favorite for commutes or road trips. The spill-resistant lid helps to prevent leaks, and many models come with straws or straw-compatible lids for even more versatility.

**Cost-Effective Quality**  
While similar to high-end brands like Yeti, RTIC tumblers offer comparable performance at a more budget-friendly price. This balance of quality and affordability makes them appealing to anyone looking for an insulated tumbler that performs well without the premium price tag.

In short, an RTIC cooler tumbler is a versatile, reliable choice for keeping your drinks at the right temperature while you're on the go, in the office, or enjoying the outdoors.

1ggzwxl,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/1ggzwxl/please_check_your_vitamin_deficiencies/,Please check your vitamin deficiencies,"Hey, I just wanted to remind you all that you should check your vitamin deficiencies! If you are restricting you will very likely develop some kind of deficiency eventually. 

The last few weeks I had been feeling terrible. I felt very tired yet struggled to fall asleep. I would often wake up at night and even after 10 hours of sleep I was still tired. I also felt constantly exhausted and fatigued. My daily walks drained me of so much energy even though I love walking. I couldn't do them anymore. Recently I also started to become very depressed. There was this deep sadness inside of me and I didn't understand why. Nothing was fun anymore. It was like my brain couldn't produce any happy chemicals. I felt so disconnected. I just wanted to cry all of the time. My memory got increasingly worse too and I often had headaches. 

2 weeks ago on saturday I wanted to learn for uni and I looked at the script from the last lecture and I didn't remember having ever seen any of it nor could I remember anything that my professor had said. When I read a sentence it didn't make any sense to me. I tried reading it over and over again but I just didn't understand it. I felt like my brain was disconnected from my body. I was freaking out and just started crying and laid in bed for the rest of the day. The next day on Sunday I forced myself to get up and took a shower. I felt so miserable like deeply depressed. I haven't felt this bad in years. 

Anyways after taking a shower I decided to drink an energy drink again after a long time. Weirdly enough after drinking it I suddenly felt alot better and had an burst of energy. Suddenly I felt motivated to do some housework and looked forward to enjoying the free day. I wondered why I suddenly felt so much better. I knew it wasn't the caffeine because I had been drinking coffee the days before with no change. I looked on the ingredients of the energy drink can and then it hit me: B12! 

I remembered how I developed B12 deficiency when I was a teenager after a few months of being vegetarian (and no restriction). I was having the same symptoms as now. My doctor back then had prescribed me B12 supplements and I quickly recovered. I completely forgot about this incident. I have been restricting for almost 2 years now and have eaten barely any animal products over the last few months. It makes so much sense. 

On the following Monday I bought a B vitamin complex and have been taking it everyday since then and so far I'm still feeling great! It's so bizarre. Just 2 weeks ago I felt so deeply sad and got increasingly more unhappy, tired, fatigued and was unable to remember anything. And now I'm feeling so motivated and calm again. I can fall asleep again and actually feel rested (even after less than 8 hours). My memory works again and I can actually think. My mood made an instant 180. I haven't cried once since then and I'm just so happy and energized. I can't believe how months of growing depression can just disappear after one day. I guess that's just what B12 deficiency does to my brain and body.

I wanted to share this story because I feel like many people on here could be at risk of developing some kind of deficiency. I feel so stupid for not ever considering that a restrictive diet could eventually lead to some kind of deficiency and how I wasn't taking any precautions. Please stay safe and take care of yourselves <3",3,1730445939.0,EDAnonymous,0,1.0,False

Either only a female help who can come finish work and go back each day, I need to know what’s an ideal amount that Mysuur house helps get paid (INR3k or 4K)

Btw the house is in outskirts of Mysuru near Lalithadrinagara (attached to Lalithadripura and ring road is 600m away ) 

2. Need to install a water softener bcoz each time we boil water there is lot of sediments in the vessel, faucets and vehicle window have tuned dotted with those hardness stains 

Currently I am not residing in Mysuru, but if anyone here has any sorted contacts or from your mutuals who can help me that would be kind

1ggzsdy,https://www.reddit.com/r/DreamInterpretation/comments/1ggzsdy/dream_of_dead_relative_waking_up_from_coffin_and/,Dream of dead relative waking up from coffin and blaming me terribly," 

My wife's grandfather used to live with us.

He lost consciousness and got admitted to ICU. He was resuscitated after CPR and medications. When he was in and out of consciousness, I was able to talk to him. He complained of feeling cold, I made sure he got blankets to keep him at ease.

The physicians recommended us to keep him in Hospice and didn’t advise aggressive treatment. My wife’s family choose aggressive treatment and he gained consciousness in ICU. My mother in law got him admitted in a state of art hospital (I am from India). He was questioning his family, who took the decision to get him admitted in this hospital? He talked about flying to places and seeing from the sky.

He celebrated his 90^(th) birthday in ICU and the doctors were kind enough to arrange a cake and let him sip his favourite coffee.

I recommended hospice and implied it’s time to let him go. That made his family pretty upset and resentful towards me.

He was eventually moved to palliative care. He was barely conscious. But I felt he was listening to us when we talk. I felt he found it difficult to let go. We being Christians, told him to “give everything to GOD and trust in GOD”. I felt he was listening to me from his eye moments. Relative visited to bid final good-byes.

After around 10 days in palliative care, he passed away. The next day he got buried. 

**On the night of his funeral, I had this vivid terrifying dream. We were in his funeral. He was kept in place for visits. Then he was moved to the burial ground. At that time, he woke up and started blaming me for everything. I was terrified. Don’t remember reactions from anyone. I remember being blamed for all his situations and his dead. I started crying profusely. It felt dreadful and my heart was broken and shattered.**

I woke up the next moment in dread and took a while to realize it was a dream.

He and my mother in law were planning to stay with us for a while (temporarily). But it turned out to be for over 3+ years. Mother in law wanted to move to her place, but he wanted to stay with us; as we lived in a 3 bed room house with healthcare facilities nearby and we had house maid and other comforts. I never insisted them to leave as I felt my mother-in-law can look after our kid when we are out working.

My relationship with his was respectful and not without troubles. I hated him interfering in some of the decisions I made. He had this arrogance and wants to get things done in ‘his way’. I treated him with respect and never interfered in his life or his comforts. I admire his frugal living, disciplined life and strong will. There were moments when he was healthy, he will refuse me carrying his bags. I had to insist to get his luggage from him. I admired his will.

But he kinda felt cold and less with affection we get from elderly. My grandfather was just his opposite. My grandfather was kind and talks with love and affection particularly in his last days. He was at peace when he died and had such a calm happy face after his death. 

 

I had this dream almost a year ago. Still I can’t knock-off the dread out of it. **I wonder what this dream means?** I don’t think it was my subconscious speaking. I am inclined towards the belief of dead sprits wandering in the works for few days (3 days) after they die before transitioning to their next phase. Was he pissed-off with me? I asked the palliative nurse many questions when he was declared dead. I was convinced only after they explained that his breathing, heart-rate are gone and his brain activities are dead.",1,1730445293.0,DreamInterpretation,2,0.99,False
1ggzrdi,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ggzrdi,This place deserves its own subreddit. Feel free to post *anything Cave City related…,"🪨 Do it! 

Cave City, in Barren co., Kentucky is an interesting place to discover to say the least. Situated right between Louisville and Nashville off of I-65, it’s an ideal spot for travelers to check out. 

Did I mention it contains the longest cave system in the entire world? 

There are also a lot of fun / family-oriented tourist attractions. 150+ life size dinosaurs, action parks with rides, shows, a wildlife museum full of hundreds of real stuffed animals, zip-lining, lakes, quirky roadside gift shops, old-school Americana attractions, *multiple caves, amazing trails and views, and plenty of other charms for a place with a population of around 2,500 only. 

Cave City is also growing considerably, and being frequented by artists moreso than in years before. It now has a fun dive bar, an exceptional coffee shop, an art gallery, a book store, yoga studio, and other appealing places that you would not  expect to see in such a small destined to NOT be forgotten town. 

I’ve seen a lot of this country, traveling far west to north, seeing the upper east parts of it, also everything surrounding us in all of KY, which has a lot to offer—but Cave City’s a place that’s truly unlike anywhere I’ve been. A few short years ago I wasn’t so optimistic about this place. I wanted it to return to its former glory, and for it to see potential I knew it had. It’s grown exponentially since. It will only become better. You have to see it in person. Come for an event, bring your kids, come grab a coffee, walk around and get to know some locals, come see a tour of the largest cave on Earth. Come find the things off the beaten path that you can get into. You won’t regret it. 

Good lodging available. A lot to see, truly… your best bet is to find a local in a down town business to point you in the right direction or tell you what to see based on your interests. Some of the things I intentionally left out because it’s nice to explore and find things on your own and be surprised.

1ggzr0r,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ggzr0r/bad_medicine/,Bad Medicine,"The solitary figure staggered along the trail. Every few steps, he would sway and veer into the brush to either side, or pause, hands on knees, head lolling, before forcing himself on.

The sentry called an alert as soon as he saw the figure solidify from the heat-haze, and recognized his uniform. A wagon was dispatched, a medic riding shotgun. After giving him a canteen, the driver and medic together lifted the man into the wagon, then turned around and rode at full gallop to the fort.

“Begging your pardon, Colonel sir!” The private snapped a credible salute from the doorway. The gleaming brass plaque on the open door next to him read ‘Col. Thomas Aloysius Morden.’

The owner of the plaque and the name inscribed looked up from his desk. Bluish smoke wreathed his head, curling up from the pipe clenched between his lips. He took a draw from it, and clouds billowed from his mouth as he answered. “Speak, soldier.”

The private shifted his balance from one boot to the other. “Well sir, the squad you sent out to harass the savages….”

Colonel Morden’s chair creaked as he leaned back. “Ah yes,” he recalled, “Lieutenant Galloway’s men. I take it they send news?” He held out a hand in expectation of something written.

“Um, not as such, sir,” the private hedged, face twisted in distress.

Colonel Morden frowned. “They took losses?” he demanded, eyes turned downward toward his desk. “That doesn’t make sense. That village wasn’t supposed to have any fighters.” His gaze snapped up to the private again. “How bad is it? Did the Lieutenant survive?”

“Doc Thorogood thinks you ought to come see for yourself, sir,” the private blurted. “He’s in the infirmary with the survivor.” His eyes bulged as he realized his own slip.

“Survivor?” Colonel Morden roared, springing to his feet with such force that his chair skidded back to fetch up against the window-sill behind him. “One survivor?” He rounded his desk and stormed toward the doorway. “Out of the way, private!”

The private dodged to one side as Colonel Morden quick-marched across the compound to the infirmary. “Thorogood!” he roared. “How is he?”

“Doc” Thorogood straightened and turned. His mutton-chop sideburns made his already wide face look spherical. “Exhausted,” he answered. “Dehydration, exposure, I’m not sure what else yet. I wouldn’t have called for you except he insisted.” He held up a hand. “But go easy if you want answers. He’s this close,” he held up a thumb and forefinger just barely apart from each other. “Push too hard, and we could lose him.”

“C-Colonel,” the soldier groaned. He tried to push himself up onto his elbows, but one arm refused to cooperate. “Colonel, I m-must report.” Though his eyelids sagged with fatigue, intensity burned in his eyes.

“All right, son,” Colonel Morden soothed. He slid a chair next to the cot and perched on it. “Take your time. What happened to the rest of your squad? To Lieutenant Galloway? Was it an ambush?”

The soldier shook his head. “No, sir,” he wheezed. “Wasn’t any resistance at all. Nobody to resist.” His gaze shifted to one side, features twisted in confusion. “No fighters. Just women, children, and old folk.” He looked up at the colonel. “Wasn’t there supposed to be armed resistance, sir?”

“Never mind that,” Colonel Morden counseled. “Did you carry out the mission?”

The soldier stared at Colonel Morden, sick realization in his eyes, then nodded slowly. “Yes, sir,” he confirmed. “Every Indian in that village was killed.”

Colonel Morden’s shoulders sagged in relief. “Well,” he grumbled, “there’s that, at least. Now, um, what’s your name, son?”

“Sutton, sir,” the soldier supplied. “Private Sutton.”

Colonel Morden nodded. “So everything went well at the village,” he summarized. “Was your squad ambushed on the way back?”

Private Sutton opened his mouth to answer, when his eyes flew open wide, focused on the infirmary’s open doorway. “No!” he screamed. “No, not me!” He floundered on the cot, legs flailing as if to gain purchase, to curl himself into a ball. “It wasn’t me! Please!”

Both the colonel and the medic turned to stare at the empty portal, then back at the panicked man on the cot. Private Sutton now had his legs tucked up against his chest and his head buried between them, arms wrapped over his head. He rocked back and forth, making small mewling noises.

“Private!” Colonel Morden shouted. He grabbed Private Sutton’s shoulder and shook it. “Pull yourself together, man! What happened to your squad?” Despite repeated demands and shaking, no further answers came forth. With a disgusted snort, Colonel Morden shoved the private hard enough to roll him onto his side, and rose from his seat. He turned to “Doc” Thorogood with a scowl. “Let me know if he starts making sense again,” he commanded, and stalked from the infirmary.

“Corporal Chavez!”

“Sir!” A swarthy whip of a man interrupted the tune he strummed on a guitar and sprang to attention. All conversation in the barracks ceased. Other soldiers not currently on duty looked up from their books, letters, or games, drawn by the urgency in their commander’s voice.

Colonel Morden locked his eyes on Corporal Chavez’s. “Corporal, you are to assemble a search team. We need to know what happened to Lieutenant Galloway and his squad, immediately.”

“Sir, yes sir!” Corporal Chavez snapped a precise salute. He waited until Colonel Morden turned and strode from the barracks, then turned his eyes to his fellow soldiers. “I need four men,” he announced. “Volunteers, or do I have to pick?”

An hour later, five horses and riders trotted from the fort. At Colonel Morden’s order, the gate, normally left open, swung shut behind them, the bar thrown. The sun had passed zenith, but several hours of daylight remained.

Harold “Doc” Thorogood sat at his desk, quill in hand. In front of him sprawled the infirmary log, Private Sutton’s condition the latest addition. The nib of the quill bent a little too much, and a blob of ink dripped on the page. “Doc” swore and reached for the blotter.

Thomas Aloysius Morden poured a dollop of whiskey into his coffee, the only thing that cut through the acid. Then he packed a fresh load of tobacco into his pipe, and reached for a match.

Horses in the stable snorted and shuffled nervous little dances in their stalls. “Easy!” urged the stablehand. He patted the nose of an especially frantic gelding, and reached in his pocket for a bit of rock candy.

Corporal Ernesto Chavez pulled on the reins with one hand, while he raised the other to signal a stop. He leaned forward in his saddle and squinted against the afternoon sun. “Think we found ‘em,” he murmured. He studied the landscape a moment more, then clucked at his mount and tapped heels to flanks. They rode on, into a shallow bowl that became a pond in the wet months.

No horses remained at the scene. No carcasses – either they were captured, or ran off on their own. Vultures hopped about, intent on what the coyotes had left. A sick-sweet stench hung heavy in the air, thick also with flies. Bedrolls lay in orderly fashion around the remains of a fire, lumpy and torn.

“Madre de dios,” Chavez prayed.

“Damn savages,” opined another soldier as he pulled alongside. The man’s jaw worked, and he ejected a thick stream of tobacco-stained saliva. “Ambush, sure enough. Took ‘em while they slept.” He turned his face toward Chavez. “Burial detail, Corporal?”

“A moment.” Chavez dismounted and dropped the reins. His horse complained, but she was well-trained; she stood where he left her. Vultures squawked and hopped clear as he picked his way among the bedrolls. He found Lieutenant Galloway’s hat next to one of the bedrolls closest to the coals, but had to guess that the remains in the roll were his. He continued his circuit of the campsite. “Seventeen,” he counted, “eighteen, nineteen….”

Chavez spun and sprinted back to his horse. “Bury them,” he ordered. “Bring back whatever effects you can salvage.”

The chewing soldier stared at him. “Yes, Corporal,” he acknowledged. “But where are you going?”

Chavez did not answer, but snapped the reins and gave his horse both heels. Dust billowed in his wake as he galloped in the direction of the fort.

Smoke rose like a beacon, thick and black. Chavez kept pace as the burning fort rose over the horizon. Shouts and screams came to his ears, though they dwindled as he came closer. He drew his pistol as he rode through the open gate, cocked it and took aim.

Private Sutton, smeared in soot and blood, bent over “Doc” Thorogood, busily sawing at the man’s scalp with a knife. “Saanii!” Sutton screamed. “Alchini!” He repeated the words with each stroke of the knife, while the medic screamed and flailed.

Chavez’s shot entered through Sutton’s left eye, and exited with the back of his skull trailing behind. Chavez leaped from his horse and jogged across the compound, pistol ready though he felt sure he had killed Sutton. “Doc!” he yelled, as he knelt next to the bleeding man.

“Doc” pressed both hands over his scalp, as if by doing so he could force the flopping swath of skin and hair back into place. “Crazy,” he whimpered, “he went crazy.”

Chavez shrugged off his jacket and wrapped it around “Doc’s” head. “Come on,” he urged, looping one arm under “Doc’s.” “Get you to the…” He looked around, and spotted the inferno that was once the infirmary. “Where’s the colonel?”

“Doc” staggered to his feet, most of his weight on Chavez. “Dead,” he slurred. “All dead. He wouldn’t stop, just kept on….” He jerked, back arched, mouth agape in a voiceless scream.

Chavez glimpsed movement behind them. He released “Doc” and spun, and stared into Sutton’s remaining eye. Sutton grinned at him, and yanked the knife from “Doc’s” back. “Saanii,” he growled, “alchini.”

Chavez had spent time among the Indians, enough to gain basic command of their language. He blinked as he translated Sutton’s words. “Women. Children.”

Sutton lunged, and Chavez drew his saber as he spun clear. He put aside the question of how the man still moved, whirled in a circle and put all the strength of his shoulder and torso to whip the blade at the back of Sutton’s neck. The edge bit and continued through. Sutton staggered a few drunken paces forward, as if to chase his head which bounced and rolled in the dirt. He dropped to one knee, then sprawled, a dark puddle spreading from his neck.

Corporal Chavez stared down at Private Sutton’s body. His gaze drifted further, to where the man’s head rested on its side, remaining eye open and staring. Motion caught his attention, and he snapped his focus to the gate of the fort.

Women.

Children.

Old people.

They stood in the open entry. They stared at him.

I take clients for work… iykyk. I’ve been saying I should probably leave the industry just for my sobriety for a bit but haven’t pulled the plug. Last night I got two clients. That’s it.

1ggzp5r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Semenretention/comments/1ggzp5r/socialpsychological_effects_of_sr/,Social/psychological effects of SR,"What I realize from doing SR since a while is that the image of yourself that you project to others is different, in a good way. I believe that on SR you project more light than darkness compared to no SR. This is what causes magnetism.

Magnetism isnt just women being drawn to you, but men also and animals. My cat is close to me 90% of the time now, I call her and she comes immediately.

Random men who id say are alpha and more authentic tend to acknowledge me more and shows respect. I also seek them more now and have a lot more fun socializing with them  because I don't feel intimidated by them anymore. I see them as higher quality people and they are more fun to be around than betas. 

 Random people I know in a poolroom I go to tend to pay me drinks or coffee or offer me food out of the blue. Its like many seem to seek my validation while I don't really seek theirs although im mostly kind with them. Narcissists seems a lot more uncomfortable around me, they know they cannot project their bs on me and ask for my validation.

Now of course women pay more attention to me also. The women im more drawn to now seems to be the more savage/shy kind because once they feel comfortable around me, they become so nice and adorable. These are the ones I like to have a bond with and possibly eventually date.

More seductive women can give me a headbuzz and sexually excites me depending of the energy they project on me. But I don't feel that drawn to them socially/emotionnally like the savage/shy ones.

I think regular pmo really wastes your inner energy and makes you project more darkness such as shame and guilt which is repulsive to most people. SR changes that. Your sexual energy building up mostly gets rid of the shame and guilt. I can also feel anger more easily now if im being disrespected and I will sometimes act upon it directly or simply discard these people without saying a word with 0 care for them.

SR also makes me a lot more analytical of myself and other people. Im actually reading a lot on Carl Jung writings about analytical psychology seeking to better understand myself. It's like SR is adding a layer of depth to the usual reality that I couldn't see before. Im now able to sense people's energy more and kinda more easily read their mind.

Also yeah, my voice is deeper, more dominant and masculine.

I find that doing SR and cutting the immediate gratification of pmo is a very small price to pay to get all of this.

SR is definitely real guys!

Which led to me eating like crap, tons of sugar, fried, spicy, fatty food. I ate red meat over chicken since I felt bad eating chicken, and I love butter/cheese. Yesterday, I had a pain in my stomach felt unusual that would come and go. I’m not stranger to stomach pain so I thought it was just period cramps. Then I got searing pain right through my middle of stomach, and cramps I’ve never felt before. I went to the ER, and found out I had gallstones, and luckily they’re small so I didn’t need emergency surgery. 

That was not on my bingo card for sure. I’m going to follow up with my primary soon, but it was a wakeup call for sure about my diet. I’m not even sure what caused the attack itself, but I do eat a lot of high fat food (butter, whole milk etc), a ton of sugar in my coffee/tea, and refined carbs. Not a soda drinker, but I do sometimes have poppi soda or coke zero. I eat a lot of spicy food, and snack on chips or flamin hot cheetos a lot. It’s a little overwhelming to suddenly have to change 100% of your diet. I don’t know how I’m going to cook without butter and oil lol. I know this is personal for each person who has gallstones, but what did you have to end up cutting out to help yours?

Has this happened to anyone else?,"My mom (57F) was diagnosed with Epilepsy 10 years ago and has been on lamictal since her tonic clonic In 2014. That was her only tonic clonic, the other seizures have just been absence seizures.  
This week her lamictal was upped by 50 mg due to having lots of seizure activity in her frontal lobe in her last MRI a few weeks ago. A few days ago she started complaining of lots of headaches and was extremely tired. We both chalked it up to the adjustment to her new dose. 
She woke up Tuesday morning saying she felt much better. She brewed coffee, got the mail, did all her normal things. We were watching tv in the living room and suddenly said she felt really dizzy and her vision was double. She’s never had double vision before and it concerned me immediately, within a minute of her saying this she stood up and fell into the coffee table and her speech was slurred in a way I had never heard before. I helped her get on to the couch and her speech got increasingly more slurred and hard to understand within seconds.
She was conscious and aware the whole time but she was saying the same few things like in a loop. She remembers herself laughing hysterically while I ran upstairs to change, I told her I was going to call 911 and she started screaming no over and over. I put on a pair of jeans, preparing us to go to the hospital and they showed up within 10 minutes. They heard her slur her birthday and name they told her they were going to take her to the hospital and they carried her out. She was agreeable and answered all their questions but was really out of it and could hardly speak. Her mouth was numb but it wasn’t specific to one side and she was as aware of everything. She could smile evenly, moved her arms and legs the way they wanted and passed every memory test including what our address was. On the way outside she made sure to tell them what hospital she wanted to go to, told me to fill our cats water dishes, lock our front door, etc. 
They treated it like a stroke and gave her asprin in the ambulance because that was what it looked like to me in the moment and also what I said to the operator and paramedics. We got to the hospital and they put me in the waiting room until they deemed her ready for me to see her. 
I was calling everyone, hyperventilating, acting absolutely hysterical in the ER bathroom thinking these were my last moments with my mom. 
I finally got to see her maybe an hour later and she was almost completely back to normal. 
Her speech was fine aside from being a little slower than usual, gait was normal, and was still repeating some questions but was mostly alright. They did a CT scan and even though nothing came up abnormal, they admitted her for 2 days for further testing. They did an MRI, ECG and hooked her up to a 24 hour EKG. Everything came up normal and nothing else ended up happening. The doctors are still baffled as to what happened and can’t decide between a TIA or a seizure. They ruled out a major stroke. She was discharged today and remembers everything. Can seizures present this way? Hers never have but it could always be a first. She said there was no aura like there was with her tonic clonic and no warning aside from the headache, double vision, and dizziness. She had a seizure last summer that presented as complete confusion and odd behaviors that lasted a few days but it was completely different from this. Paramedics couldn’t take her and the hospital wouldn’t admit her so that episode was never documented.

Started as a joke when I used to go out for gatherings and parties, and I used to smoke only when I had drinks. One fine day I broke out of that habit and had a cigarette when I was not having a drink, and then slowly this habit creeped in to my everyday life. I go out for tea, I would smoke. Coffee, smoke. Come out after a movie, smoke. 

Not that I'm unable to go through a day without smoking. But I'm absolutely disgusted by this habit now. I feel tired most of the time. My throat feels sore without any reason. My teeth got stains. 

I've tried quitting in the past, but I haven't kept up with it. I usually give up by the second or third day, and I usually find a reason for it too - work stress or sorts. 

  
I'm trying to be a bit more serious now. I'll be posting daily (daily is the goal, but at least once in 2 days) about my progress and the triggers I face, so that anyone can join me in my journey and I hope that I get tips on how to manage my urges and triggers in better ways. Hopefully this becomes a guide for anyone who wants to do it too. Also going public creates this additional sense of accountability.

On the actual post, this part will start right after I realized that I was trans, and slowly started to transition. But not before Sourface And Queenie have had their ""downfall"". Also I did some what try to dress up more ""boyish"" and Goodfella and Sourface did notice but both have different reasons but we'll get there when we get there. Goodfella also shows up more and more in this saga. (More on that on later) 

**Presenting the cast for the drama shit-storm**

**Dizzy:** 19 at the time, spine finally shined though, now a jaded Introvert who's slowly coming of the closet as a trans-man. Also going though *caca de vaca* because a ""friend"" ""needed"" me.

**Sourface:** 21 years old who's a three year community college student, The mean girl in a fat-man's body that is filled with nothing but ICK! Hates his younger brother.

**Goodfella:** 18 years old who's related to the mean girl in a fat-man's body. He's not a friend (don't worry I have tells about him as well but in this tale), and wants to bring Queenie's and Sourface's downfall. Hates his older brother if that wasn't clear.

**Queenie:** 20 year old who was lovingly following her man just make sure he was ok and not dating other girls. Totally didn't go crazy. She's cousins with Sourface and Goodfella by marriage. her appearance is short.

Before we get into all the ""talky"" parts of the story, I wanted to simply explain the rest of the week after the meeting with Goodfella. In my journal I wrote how I wasn't doing well mentally. At the time I had untreated ADHD but I was diagnosed at the end of high school. My family wasn't the most well off and any child of migrant parents will tell you is that it's harder to get well-paying jobs if you don't speak the language very well or not at all. My dad's job at the time was playing well but it wasn't enough due to my older sister also getting a higher education. My mom couldn't work due her going blind. I thought I didn't need meds even though I now realized it would have help me get through community college without the unwanted stress. But since I live in good ol' US of A, medication was simply too much money. And not only that I was starting to develop an actual coffee addiction to the point where I wasn't even drinking plain water nor eating proper meals. Just straight black coffee, but it was a slippery slope to something I guess ""stronger"". I've learned that people with ADHD are at higher risk of developing addictions due to their dopamine irregulation. Combine that with stress of college and the bullshit Artlad put me though, it landed me in the hands of Goodfella. Goodfella really did hate both Queenie and Sourface, he don't want to go into much detail but he kinda hinted that home life wasn't the greatest in terms of being siblings with Sourface. In the last post, he said he came out as Androsexual (liking men and/or people who look manly) and later on told me it was in middle school when he came out, Sourface seem to make it his mission to be down right cruel to him. Or at lease that's how Goodfella described it to me, but he's kinda had me in the dark about it but when ever it comes up he tends to speak with a lot of venom and I'm guessing with internal pain as well. Goodfella did really seem to be the friend that I needed, most of my high school friends left town or straight up left state for college and I only had Artlad and Bestbro. Bestbro however was busy with Artlad and the bullshit he caused so I was basically on my own to deal with his aftermath. Goodfella felt like the shoulder that I needed, the friend who can help, just someone I could trust. After that blow-up with Queenie and her basically chasing me all over campus, along with her ""yes-men"" to convince me to rejoin the club so it doesn't shut down and me going ""fuck off"", yeah I thought I've made a friend without the help of others. Goodfella was the one to notice that I was sad, stressed or simply not ok the moment he saw me. Hell, he even notice I've lost weight even under the puffy sweaters. I wasn't losing weight because I wanted to, I was losing weight from me not taking care of myself. There's one thing about dopamine is that you CAN get a dopamine rush by also activating a rush of adrenaline. And that's what start this tell, I knew me going though what Sourface put me though last time was worst thing I can do to myself but that adrenaline is what I ""needed"" to get dopamine. I was basically self-harming. So thought of a plan to help Goodfella and in a way, get me out of this drama. I haven't seen both Sourface and Artlad in a while however I knew Artlad took a week off from coming to campus due he feeling like crap. I knew about it because I've heard it though the grapevine A.K.A. from Bestbro. This whole bullshit happened within FOUR weeks. I started in this campus with the most stupidest drama ever (well in my opinion it is). Sorry for the wall of text, I just needed to explain. I've texted Goodfella with the following.

**Me: Hey Goodfella, I think I've made a plan where both Queenie and Sourface get expose. The one thing is we need evidence.**

**Goodfella: How the hell I'm getting evidence? If they see me, they'll just stop what they are doing.**

**Me: I think that's were I come into play. My question is did you is have you told Artlad or anyone really about your home-life?**

**Goodfella: I've only told Artlad about me not liking my brother but the whole money thing. Why? The only reason I've told you is because I wanted you to help me and help you get even.**

**Me: I'm still not sure you should be doing this. I feel this could back fire on you and also lose your uncle's funding.**

**Goodfella: I have a job if that happens, sure it's nice but that doesn't mean I should deal have to with** ***HIM*** **in order to get money. Plus, the money I do get is nowhere near the same as Queenie's and Sourface's. I just get enough for books.**

**Me: damn dude, you basically said you're the black sheep without actually saying it. So what is it that actually makes your uncle go ""oh hell no!"" in terms of him cutting them off?**

**Goodfella: My family didn't like the idea of Queenie and Sourface being.....close. They tried everything and in their eyes it stop but I caught them many times and they always said I'm nothing and other thing just because I'm queer.**

**Me: I still think the whole money thing you're telling me is a lie and really you want me to help ruin their reputation among your family.**

**Goodfella: Both can true at the same time. Look, I know what I'm asking is a lot and you're having a hard time with your pal Artlad. If evidence is what I need, then so be it. I'm just asking for back-up.**

**Me: And what happens if they do get cut off?** 

**Goodfella: They don't return to this campus duh! I don't know about Queenie but I'm sure as hell that my parents aren't picking up Sourface's tuition fee.**

**Me: Still on the fence about it.**

**Goodfella: If it helps, just because they get cut off doesn't mean I'm getting anything from it. My uncle made it very clear.**

**Me: On one hand I shouldn't be a part of this.....**

**Goodfella: But on the other hand?**

**Me: Just talking to you about it kinda feel.....I guess whole? Feel okay? Or maybe it's just an excuse to talk to you. I don't really have that many friends and the one I DO have put me in this shit.**

**Goodfella: That bad huh? I think I know how to start the down fall. Queenie is going to be hard but I know how to ""bait"" Sourface.**

**Me: Bait? What do you mean by ""bait""?**

**Goodfella: You let me worry about that. I think what you should do, is figure out if Sourface has a ""vendetta"" against Artlad.**

**Me: He doesn't even like Queenie, like you said before he's ""with her"" out of pity.**

**Goodfella: It's an ego thing. Artlad is a good looking dude and Sourface always goes on and on how ""women don't like men like me"" and to him, he's right cuz of Artlad.**

**Me: I witness Sourface being pissed off at Artlad for NOT letting him ""in"" on Artlad's fuckery on Queenie. Like he wants to hurt Queenie, that's why I'm having a hard time believing Sourface is doing it for ""her honor"".**

**Goodfella: He's NOT doing for that. He's doing it want I believe is his own ""cock-fight"" of being more manly. Sourface has a weird view on women.**

**Me: Cock-fight? Like is he trying to prove his manliness? To Queenie?**

**Goodfella: NO! to himself. You DO know what's a cock-fight right?**

**Me: I'm Mexican, we invented cock-fights. But I do understand the metaphor. I know there's no actual roosters. Just a ""sword"" fight of the ego.**

**Goodfella: Haha, good. See ya tomorrow to work out the details?**

**Me: Yeah, sounds good, 'til then see you soon.**

After that, I remember feeling off still, I still didn't believe the whole money because if he really has a rich uncle, couldn't just pay for a four-year university? To this day I'm still on the fence about it. However, I DO think Goodfella really did want to hurt Sourface, with what little info he did say, reading in between the lines kinda does paint the picture of Sourface being the golden child. It's giving the vibe of the parents just wanting grandkids and thinking Goodfella being queer means not wanting kids? I have so many stories about that family but that's for a different tale. In my journal, I noted that it was on a Wednesday where I meet up Goodfella at one of the college's study rooms.

**Me: Hey I'm here, ready to talk about the....details?**

**Goodfella: Hi, yes and I have some info that really give me some bad vibes.**

**Me: how so?**

He told me to take a sit if I remember correctly, I noted in my journal that in this study room, the air felt both heavy and filled with unfiltered ""vengeance"". 

**Goodfella:** \*taking a deep breath\* **Remember I told you Sourface has a vendetta against Artlad?**

**Me: Yeah?**

**Goodfella: I've over heard him and his ""pals"" he wants to fight Artlad for ""cucking"" him. He believes Queenie's infatuation with Artlad is Artlad himself trying to be the ""bigger"" alpha male. Even if Sourface was using Queenie for.......that.** 

I spend a good few seconds trying processes, what the fuck I've just heard. All that build up for something that dumb.

**Me: Sorry, you had me wait a whole day, just to tell me something that could be learned in one hour!**

**Gooodfella: You fucking dumbass. I was getting confirmation that Sourface is still going that it with our cousin. Even if it could be learned within an hour, I still took the time to see if Queenie is still chasing her ""man"".** 

**Me:........What do you mean by.....""chasing"". Does she really call Artlad her man?**

**Goodfella:** \*he gives a devilish smile\* **I'm pretty sure Queenie is stalking Artlad without him knowing.** 

**Me: So I was right to tell her that she stalked us at the park!**

**Goodfella: You found her there?**

**Me: No she confronted the next day by smacking acrossed the face and calling me a homewrecker.**  

**Goodfella: Homewrecker!? Damn she's really deep in the sauce!**

**Me:** \*sarcastically\* **Gee thanks for not making a joke at my expense.**

**Goodfella: I wasn't joking, she's really losing her mind over a guy who has a track-record of being horrible with relationships.** 

**Me: Speaking of Artlad, I.....I haven't spoken to him since that meet-up.** 

**Goodfella: Good.**

**Me: Good!? How's that good?**

**Goodfella: It means we can work on our plan.**

**Me: You mean getting evidence?**

**Goodfella: Yes, that.**

**Me: Can you just take pictures or show them Queenie's stalker tendencies?**

**Goodfella: No, that means she's moved on from Sourface therefore no much to worry.** 

**Me: She's. Stalking. Someone. How's that not grounds for wrong doing?**

**Goodfella: If I tell you that my family has weird views on gender and believe women are ""weak"", would you think she'll be ""punished"".**

**Me: I'm not sure but I'm leaning towards no.** 

**Goodfella: Exactly. But I have a plan that could cause a huge blow-out.** 

**Me: And this is........**

**Goodfella: You flirting with Sourface.** 

**Me: HELL NO! ARE KIDDING ME!?**

**Goodfella: I'm not asking you to go all the way, just flirting.**

**Me: I would rather get my ass fucked by Dick Cheney during a hunting event.** 

**Goodfella: Ha. Ha. Very funny.** 

**Me: Why would I flirt with him if he's so invested on stopping Queenie dating life?**

**Goodfella: Queenie. Is. The. Jealous. Type. You flirt with Sourface since she already thinks you're a homewrecker, why not get her jealous enough to cause a scene.** 

**Me: You're killing me here! And for what?**

**Goodfella: Queenie can't handle it and she'll confront Sourface and we'll record the whole thing and that's our evidence. That's for what for.** 

**Me: But why me? Can you just pay a girl to flirt with him? Just because Queenie thinks I'm a homewrecker doesn't mean I should be the one to do it. Maybe the girl could be really pretty.**

**Goodfella:** \*pinching the bridge of his nose\* **Dizzy, if I do that, then it seems Sourface is acting up and playing Queenie's game.** 

**Me: So I'm the more ""believable"" option. Wouldn't just make everybody think I'm psycho? I've told basically everybody what he did and I 100% DID. NOT. LIKE. IT.** 

**Goodfella: Hmmmm, that does complicate things. How about ""we"" start by making friends with him and say he's a better friend then Artlad? By we, I mean you.** 

**Me: I'm starting to regret this.** 

**Goodfella: Don't worry, I'll be by your side. We just need him to act weird around you and in front of Queenie so we can get what we need.** 

**Me: Do you really think this is worth it? I clearly know both Queenie and Sourface can be dicks but you don't have to make up a story just for me to get back at them.** 

**Goodfella: I know it sounds off, but it's three of us getting college money at the same time. My ""share"" however, only covers books. I HAVE to pay my own tuition fees. In fact I'm sure Sourface HAS the bigger ""share"" despite Queenie being the step-daughter of my uncle. Again weird gender roles and all that.** 

**Me: So he's the one the most at risk? And that doesn't change my no to a yes.** 

**Goodfella: Look, I done with both of their bullshit. If fucking with their college fund is me finally getting some peace then so be it. What an extra $400 anyway! I'm willing to go to debt if it means no contact.** 

Before I could answer, we hear a knock on the door but as soon I turned, my heart Sunk. I still remember how the study room looked and the one thing about these study room is that they have those three squared windows that stretches from the top to the bottom of the door and you can clearly who's inside from far away. What I saw outside was none other then Sourface. With a ""Great now what"" from Goodfella, he gets up and opens the door. 

**Goodfella: What do you want Sourface? Can you see I'm in the middle of something.** 

The one thing I'm thankful for is you have to press your face against the door in order to hear inside the room but can's hide the fact you ARE listening in because of you know, the big-ass windows. 

**Sourface: I just wanted to know if Queenie was here. But all I see is a fag and a bitch talking.** 

**Goodfella: Why would Queenie be near me? She fucking hates me.**

**Sourface: Not enough for you to let her stay at your place! You're lying to me asshole, but I guess that's what get for being such an alpha male.** 

**Me: Alpha male? You, an alpha? Please dude, alpha males don't go round claiming their alpha-ness. It's like saying you're an amazing singer but refuse to go to a karaoke bar.** 

**Sourface: Pfft, whatever bitch, you'll never understand what it means to be an alpha male but it's not like you'll give them a chance. Always going after the bad guys.** 

**Goodfella: Did you just came here to bitch? Or are you just here to give me a hard time. Also what the fuck you mean ""staying in my place""?**

**Sourface: Queenie's mom called our mom asking if she's been staying with us since she has come home for weeks now. Since mom said no, auntie started to get worried since she was picking up her phone. Mom rang her and she said she was living with you since you live closer to this campus.** 

**Goodfella: What the fuck?! NO, SHE'S LYING! She's not staying with me! Bet money she's staying with one of her friends.** 

**Sourface: Listen here faggot, as the alpha male of the family it's my job to keep you two in line. and as the alpha male, I order you to get Queenie to talk to me! She's not answering my texts and all I get is a  ""fuck you"" from her when she does.** 

I fucking cringed when he said that. It's more how he said it rather what he said it, I still remember trying to growl his words or at lease sound intimidating. Remember, both Goodfella and Sourface are the same height but Sourface was way heavier then Goodfella, like twice the girth. But Goodfella just rolled his eyes and says

**Goodfella: Honey, no offense, wait no actually all the offense but you're not scary enough to push me around me anymore. Plus your ""alpha"" outfit screams ""mommy dressed you this morning"". So goodbye.** 

Before Sourface could say anything, Goodfella just shuts the door and locking it before sitting back down. Sourface just keeps slam-pounding (I don't know that's the right term) the door before getting yelled at from one of the library stuff for him to leave. Soon as he does I got an idea. 

**Me: Dude, did hear what he said!**

**Goodfella: Yes, I've heard! I'm not a dumbass.**

**Me: Think about it! If Queenie's not answering her texts nor calls from Sourface and Artlad is is also avoiding her.....**

**Goodfella: I'm listening.**

**Me: We can use that to our benefit!**

**Goodfella: How?**

**Me: By us playing messenger-boy duh! But instead of actually getting them to cool down.....**

**Goodfella: We give them false hope! By acting Artlad wants Queenie and Queenie wants to talk to Sourface......**

**Me: We can have play right to our hands!**

**Goodfella: So what you're saying......we can play in to their ""needs"" and have them ""blow out"" thinking they played each other?**

**Me: Bingo!**

**Goodfella: I think I know how and where to start.** 

So the plan was that I, me, the idiot who spine did shine though but still need to learned better boundaries, should be the one to talk to both Queenie and Sourface. The idea was I would talked to Queenie as if I was sorry and actually ""help her"" get her man while I also talked to Sourface as if I was going to help him with Queenie. What about Artlad you may ask, the thing is I was never going to tell Artlad anything to one: not ruin the plan just from him saying it out loud and two: unlike him, I didn't need someone else to do my dirty work. So Goodfella and I agreed to pretend to not be friends and meet-up in secret so he could get all the details. I know this sounds ridiculous but it was mostly us acting like mean girls and just wanting two horrible people out of our lives. The first part of the plan is for me to go to Queenie and say that ""I was sorry"" and try to convince her I was willing to help her to become Artlad's girlfriend. The other part was easy because I haven't transitioned yet so I could play into the whole ""I'm just a girl and my stupid girl hormones just wanted peace with my fellow girl. A man like you shouldn't be played"" kind of game. I wanted to puke just typing that. Now I needed to find Queenie and start acting to the plan. In my journal, I wrote down how I hated myself from doing this but the same time my anger towards both Queenie and Sourface and the hope if this works, I'll be at peace and just continue my schooling without trouble. Goodfella said that he would help me with locating them both and sending me a text on where's said location. I went home that day and for the first time in WEEKS, I came home smiling and my cousin Chikí did notice. I didn't tell her my plan and all I've said to her was that I ""fixed"" the problem. But I got a text from Bestbro asking if everything was alright. The conversation is not important to this tell but what I'll note on here is Bestbro not hearing from Artlad and me saying I haven't talked to him since the park meet-up he went to check on him. From what he told me, Artlad asked his Professors to give him work for the next week to do at home cuz he ""had a family emergency"" I.E. trying to get away from Queenie. I was also told he wasn't looking too good nether. Dear reader at that moment was the first time didn't feel bad. Is a matter of fact, I felt anger toward that. Even, years later when ever I've think of that, I couldn't bring myself to feel at lease sorry for him or sad. He was a friend and back then I've felt horrible for not understanding or being empathic for him. Now, I know why but I haven't had a falling out just yet. I was also felt that Goodfella was being a better friend then him but I couldn't see the red flags of this dude. 

Before I continue, I want to describe how Goodfella made me feel safe around him and with everything has been going on and my unhealed past. I really put on my rose-tinted glasses with him. To start, Goodfella was the total opposite of Sourface. He was more ""caring"" and he respected my boundary of personal space and he wasn't going out and airing secrets, he did listen to my troubles and he did seem to be that shoulder I needed. And this IS the only spoiler I'll give, I did stay friends after this whole shit show, he even help me with my ""second puberty"" pains. Safe to say, just be because you learn to stand-up for yourself doesn't mean you'll recognize the toxicity to put your foot down. I also wanted to add, I'm not good with making friends and at the time I only had Bestbro, his girlfriend and Artlad as my friends but they were busy with their own life and on top of that, Bestbro was ready dealing with Artlad and I wanted not to add more. It wasn't fair for Bestbro. For me, making a new friend is a huge deal and I tend to either over-look or not realize their toxic traits. My mother have once said that ""I have the heart of gold but have the mind of a blind person"" meaning I don't see what's in front of me when comes to me being trusting of my ""friends"". Sorry for the info dump now on to the story. 

Goodfella figured out where was Queenie staying and turns out Bonbon lives near by were Artlad was living. Now this area was common for students to rent out during their time in community college, and it was also where a lot of students got their jobs/was the location of a very popular shopping plaza. So this means she was 100% stalking Artlad. However I did not know if Artlad had a job or was living off student aid. But what ever the case, I asked for Queenie's number and Goodfella happily obliged. So I started texting her. FYI, I'll be adding my thoughts though out the conversation just to give an idea how manipulative I've become. (also don't be afraid to call me out. I know I wasn't in the right.)

**Me: hey Queenie, it's me Dizzy. Got a minute to talk?**

**Queenie: HOW THE FUCK YOU GOT MY NUMBER!?**

**Me: Oh! Artlad gave it to me. Look I want to say sorry for how I acted. And maybe I was a homewrecker.** (Am I a good liar or what?/s)

**Queenie: No shit you're a homewrecker! What? Were you trying to date Artlad all this time?!**

**Me: NO! It wasn't like that I swear. But I was helping him to avoid you.** (lies! All lies!) 

**Queenie: So what? Do you expect me to forgive you like nothing happened?**

**Me: No, not really. But I want to make it up to you!** (cue the ass-kissing) 

**Queenie: How?**

**Me: Remember during the whole club rush thing and how I notice you had a thing for Artlad?**

**Queenie: Yes before you when off to fuck me over?** 

**Me: Well I found out Artlad was just using me as a placeholder until he found the girl of his dreams. Even though he was Insistent we were just friends right?**

**Queenie: Yeah? So?**

**Me: Well he told me what his dream girl and I going to help you become that girl.** (Please take the bait, please take the bait, please take the bait!)

**Queenie: Really?! you mean it? You're not going to fuck me over right?**

**Me: Me? Never! I've been thinking also, maybe I could learn a thing or two about being** ***real woman*** **from you** (\*huurrk\* I hate myself, I hate myself much right now!) 

**Queenie: About time! I haven't forgive you but if you willing to help me become your friend's girlfriend, then I'll let it slide.** (YES YES YES! I GOT HER!) 

**Me: Thanks Queenie, however I can't return to the club. Not yet at lease.** 

**Queenie: Why not? Is it because I haven't forgive you?**

**Me: It's more of me letting you heal from my betrayal** (BISH! YOU'RE SETTING UP THE BETRYAL! YOU'RE JUST WATERING THE SEEDS OF HOPE JUST TO RIP THE CROP OUT!) 

**Queenie: You're right, I do need to heal. But I'll heal faster if I had my Artlad!** 

**Me: Hehehe, and you will. Just let me help ok?** (Am I a bad person? Am I really playing with a woman's fantasy just to stop the bullshit? Yes! Yes I am. Doing it the hard instead of I don't know, IGNORING THEM!)   

**Queenie: You better! Artlad will be my boyfriend! So, was the first thing that he likes?**

**Me: Hmmm, give me a minute or do you want to meet up and I'll give you a list of things he likes in a girl.** (does he even have type? What DOES he like outside of bobs and vagene?) 

**Queenie: Well what do you think is best?**

At this moment I was also texting Goodfella asking what to do next.

**Me: Dude dude dude! I have her but I don't know what to do next! I said I now his type of girl and she's asking about!** (you didn't think this though!)

**Goodfella: Just make up a list of traits. You know Artlad better then me.**

**Me: I've told her to give me a minute or if she wants, we could meet up and I'll give her a full list. She's asking what I think is best.** 

**Goodfella: OMG. Wait actually, have her meet up with you. I have an idea. I could use this for Sourface.**

**Me: HOW!?**

**Goodfella: Just trust me!**

**Me: Fine.** 

Back to Queenie.

**Me: I think it's best for us to meet up. It gives me time to get all the things he likes.** (Wait, how am I not a mean girl again?) 

**Queenie: Thank you! Thank You! Can't wait to fall into Artlad's strong arms!** (I'm praying for his safety)

**Me: Any time.** 

Back to Goodfella.

**Me: Ok! I'm in! She's meeting up with me!**

**Goodfella: Good. Now do you mind skipping class tomorrow? I have some ideas.** 

**Me: To think of it, it's just a project for the whole week. Most don't even show up since there's no lecture. The only thing is being graded is the project itself. So yeah, I can skip.** 

**Goodfella: Nice. We're meeting up in the morning.**

**Me: Coffee on me?**

**Goodfella: Hell yeah!** 

After that, my heart racing. I felt a mixture of awfulness, shame, guilt and the worst of all excitement. Again I was in the best place mentally but it was the tip of the iceberg but now I can't understand why this was giving such a dopamine rush. However, my time with Goodfella wasn't during this drama, but this saga is just abot Queenie, Sourface and Artlad. My college days was a trip, and not the good kind. I have two years worth of stories and this is just the start. But this saga is almost coming to an end. 

If you're asking ""Dizzy, you sure Goodfella is toxic to you? Why do you keep digging yourself into this mess? Is this real?"" And to that I say, yes this is real and no I'm not good at storytelling or making things up. I don't know why I kept digging myself into this mess, maybe I was viewing Goodfella as a friend, and his toxic traits wasn't in full display. I don't know if you believe this tale but I lived it. I think I'm asking this question is because writing this and looking back, I hardly believe it myself. AND I LIVED IT! Now, did I go back to club? Yes, but not as an official member, and most my time ""helping"" Queenie was me in that club. But I'm getting ahead of myself. 

After talking to Goodfella and Queenie about where to meet up and stuff, I couldn't stop thinking about what the hell I was doing. But at the time, a part of me wanted DID want Goodfella to be my friend, we did agree to never see each other after this mess. But He did treat me like a good friend or I guess I took it as such and I just felt alone, starting college at a new city, living with a cousin, going though the growing pains of adulthood while going though the realization I wasn't happy with my gender, and having a friend just telling your story of your past, yeah I wanted to be friend with the brother of a guy who's knows my past trauma! I latched on to the next person who was nice to me. But I was in denial, I didn't think twice. So I agree to meet up with Goodfella. 

**Goodfella: Hey Dizzy, ready to fuck with Queenie's hope?**

**Me: Morning Goodfella, say I wanted to ask. How long CAN we keep this up?**

**Goodfella: What do you mean?** 

**Me: What if Queenie and/or Sourface finds out? And how's me giving traits of a girl that supposedly Artlad is into help with Sourface?**

**Goodfella: That why we are here. I'll explain everything, but what time did you your meeting with Queenie?**

**Me: In the afternoon**

**Goodfella: Good, we have time.** 

So we sat the main area of the campus and since this area is mostly empty in the morning he thought it was safe. 

**Me: So what's this idea you have?**

**Goodfella: Since you got Queenie with the ""promise"" of you making them boyfriend and girlfriend, I thought I should piggy back from that for Sourface but with the idea of Queenie regretting falling for Artlad.**

**Me: Ahhh, I see. And how are you going to do it?**

**Goodfella: Ohhh I'm not doing it.** 

**Me: You're kidding right?**

**Goodfella:** \*stays quite while smiling\*

**Me: Dude, I'm already over my head with Queenie. Why should I be the one to puppeteer his hope as well?**

**Goodfella: Because if I do it, they'll think something is up. Plus, since I've already told Sourface you and me only meet up that day for s class we had, it's best you be the one to do it. They know me to well.** 

**Me: I. Don't. Want. To. Be. Near. Sourface! Why is hard for you to understand?**

**Goodfella: I get it. But he'll listen to you if you play up the whole ""oh I'm sorry about me being mean, I'm just a girl with stupid girl hormones"" cuz he so deep with this whole alpha male bull.** 

**Me: Even if I play it up, wouldn't that make it easier for me to slip-up?**

**Goodfella: That's what I'm here for. I'll be with you when they are texting you to make sure they don't cross paths. And make sure we get the evidence of you know, their ""relationship"".** 

**Me:** \*sighing while face-palming\* **Is this going to take weeks?** 

**Goodfella: I doubt it, all we need is for Sourface to make a move on Queenie.** 

**Me: HOW. ARE. WE GOI-**

**Goodfella: you are going to help Sourface be more like Artlad. You know his traits and you can help with that.** 

**Me: Aaahhhh, ok. But Still.** 

**Goodfella: Don't worry, I'll be within a few yards away if anything happens when you and Sourface meet in person. Just not close enough to be spotted.** 

**Me: This getting weird I swear but, for some reason.....**

**Goodfella: you getting some kind of rush?**

**Me: Just.....wanting to see......if it's true they'll be gone after we exposed them.** 

**Goodfella: Just one little pic, I promise.**

**Me: But Goodfella, there's something I'm going though that kinda makes it harder to I guess continue being ""a girl""**

**Goodfella:** \*raises an eyebrow\* **Go on.** 

**Me: You've came out right, so you're the only one I guess who would understand.** \*taking a deep breath\* **I think I'm trans.** 

**Goodfella:** \*leans back on his seat and takes a deep breath\* **I'm not shocked, but are you planning on transitioning soon?** 

**Me: To be honest, I don't even have the money right now. But, I want to socially transition in the meantime but will it affect our plan?**

**Goodfella:** \*thinks for a bit\* **No, not really. In fact, we play around the fact he'll try to ""save"" you. Since ""girls never understands what they want in life, needs a man to help them right?"" You know, that whole ""I'm a nice guy alpha, who can treat a girl right and blah blah blah"" that kind of crap.** 

**Me: You're fucking evil, you know that? Almost as if you thought this though for sometime now. Like you really want your brother to suffer.** 

**Goodfella: You're acting like we had a good childhood. Plus, he's not that hard to predict his behavior, that's all he talks about anyway.** 

**Me: So how am I going to do this with Sourface?**

**Goodfella: I know he and Artlad texts each other from time to time. I'll give you his number and you say Artlad give it to you and act that like you want to help him by being more like Artlad. You can lie by saying ""if you act like Artlad, girls will be just falling into your arms. And if you refused, you missed the chance to make Queenie regret everything."" so what you think?**

**Me: You owe me big time Goodfella, and you better not go back on your word. I'm risking everything for this ok.** 

**Goodfella: Hehe, I know you are. You have my word.** 

We once again shake on that and when on to making the list of traits for Queenie. They were out there and some of things were just, what the fuck.

Hours later Luke was still driving when he snuck a peak at his gas gadge. ""Oh fuck its almost on E!"" he said frustrated a truck stop sign eluminated in the distance. ""Thank god."" luke said he pulled into the truck stop filled up got some coffee then he got back on the road. ""lets put on some tunes!"" Luke said to himself as he turned the radio diel to on. his favorite station was playing when decided to get some sleep he pulled off to the side of the road and fell asleep. 

Luke woke up the next day a little dazed but got back in the driver seat of his truck and kept on. later that evening as night began to fall Luke leaned back in his seat and looked at his gas gadge again. ""what the hell I just filled this fucker yesterday how can it already be low again I haven't even been on the road that long."" luke said clearly confused about how his truck got as low on fuel as it was already. Luke then jumped out of his truck and began checking the fuel lines and the big metal diesel tank itself but nothing seemed to be wrong so luke just shook it off and pulled off the next exit and into another truck stop and fueled up again. Luke was back on the road and this time his gadge stayed put. 

Luke began to relax once more until the truck completely stopped out of nowhere Luke trembled. ""what the fuck?"" he asked himself as he tried to start his truck again but it wouldn't turn over. Luke was scared out of his mind no one ever used the road he was on so he couldn't count on someone rescuing him plus he had no phone service so he sat in his truck till morning. The next morning Luke tried starting his truck again this time it started with no problems so he continued his trip. that night Luke was jamming to his radio when his truck stalled once again. ""shit why the fuck dose this keep happening!"" he shouted Luke then jumped out of his truck and investigated he found nothing and no one. Luke then hopped back in his truck and looked ahead and thats when he saw someone standing there looking at him.

1ggza3d,https://www.reddit.com/r/TellMeLiesHulu/comments/1ggza3d/stephens_smile/,Stephen's smile.,"I'm talking about Stephen's smile in the finale - after he was messed up by Leo. 

The general consensus seems to be that this smile was self-satisfaction at having successfully provoked Leo into physical violence (like Thanksgiving). I totally agree with this idea, but I also think there was a bit more to it.

In Episode 4 of Season 1, Stephen refuses to yell at his mother because he thinks 'part of \[her\] will enjoy it' or at least 'prefer it to \[him\] not giving a sh\*t about \[her\]'. The implication is that Stephen is completely unconcerned about his mother. It seemed to me like his mother at least somewhat intentionally spills coffee on herself following this comment, and Stephen rushes to help her run her hand under cold water. She hugs and leans against him, and I thought she seemed pretty satisfied with herself at having proven that Stephen cares for her instinctually. 

After Leo attacks Stephen, Lucy is the first to yell something along the lines of 'Get the f\*ck off of him!' at Leo, then yells for someone to get a towel or ice and help him. Meanwhile, she's crying and asking him if he's okay. This is the point where Stephen starts smiling. I think this is because, like his mother, he had proven that Lucy still instinctually cares for him even if she had run off to Leo and acted unconcerned about Stephen. I think it was at least somewhat of a callback to his mother's planned and manipulative self-injury.
