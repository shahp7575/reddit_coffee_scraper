( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

You are sitting at a coffee shop booth. Its one booth on either side, and a table in the middle. Youre sitting across from your avoidant other. You each have a cup of coffee. Theyre in the to go cups with lids and sleeves. Both of your coffees are well protected from spillage.

You're drinking that coffee, it's delicious. But you notice... the table is a little wobbly. But, that doesn't change the coffee. It doesn't change the people at the table. The table shakes more. A little weird, but the coffee still tastes great. Until finally, the table shakes so much that the coffee cups fall to the floor. Yours spills everywhere, but then you realize, the avoidant never opened their coffee. The coffee was too hot, too intense to handle. They know coffee is great, but look what happens when they open it, it gets everywhere, it just creates a big mess. And youre upset because your coffee is just gone and your cup is empty.

But then theres the reality. None of this had anything to do with the coffee. This had to do with the foundation that was supposed to hold the coffee. It wasnt the coffee the caused the spill. It wasnt even the anxious or the avoidant. It was the table. It was everything beneath the surface continually shaking and finally coming loose, and maybe you could see a sign, maybe you didnt notice it, but then it just all collapsed in an instant.

The avoidant will say, ""my fears about spilling the coffee were right. I was right not to open it."" The anxious will say, ""Why are they not helping me clean up the mess I made?"" Even though the anxious didn't even make the mess, they just contributed to their coffee being open, and therefore it must be something they did to cause this mess.

Thats when the manager comes over and asks what happened. Then the avoidant leaves, because they believe this isn't their mess. So they leave you to pick up the mess.​

But thats when you have a shocking revelation. You find out that this wasnt the first time the avoidant sat at that booth. They knew this table was insecure. They knew it needed repair. They knew there was a near 100% chance it would collapse. Thats when it hits you. They didnt drink their coffee because they were constantly looking at the exit.​

But all of it could have been spared if someone just fixed the underlying structure, but by the time we realize that, its already too late. ",1,1768572479.0,AvoidantBreakUps,0,0.67,False

1qegv8k,https://www.reddit.com/r/VPNforFreedom/comments/1qegv8k/best_vpns_for_geforce_now/,Best VPNs for GeForce Now,"Ever tried streaming a game on GeForce Now only to get walloped by lag spikes at the worst possible moment? Or found yourself locked out of your game library when traveling abroad? A solid VPN fixes both problems—but only if you pick the right one.

Most VPNs will wreck your gaming experience with high ping and connection drops. I've tested dozens of VPNs specifically with GeForce Now's cloud streaming platform, and only a handful can handle the demands of cloud gaming without turning your session into a slideshow.

Here's the thing about cloud gaming: latency matters more than raw download speed. GeForce Now recommends under 40ms ping for optimal performance, with 80ms as the absolute maximum before input lag becomes unbearable. A bad VPN can push you well over 100ms, making competitive gaming impossible.

✅ **Quick Answer:** NordVPN is the best VPN for GeForce Now, delivering 18ms ping—half NVIDIA's recommended threshold—thanks to its NordLynx protocol. With 8,800+ servers in 129 countries and a 77% discount bringing it to $2.99/month, it's built specifically for low-latency gaming.

# Why You'd Want a VPN for GeForce Now

Before diving into recommendations, let's talk about why you'd use a VPN with cloud gaming at all. Seems counterintuitive, right? Adding another hop between you and NVIDIA's servers?

**Here's where a VPN actually helps:**

Your ISP might throttle gaming traffic, especially bandwidth-heavy cloud streaming. I've seen this firsthand—speeds mysteriously tank during peak hours unless you're encrypted. A VPN hides what you're doing, preventing targeted throttling.

**DDoS protection matters in competitive games.** If some sweaty kid you just destroyed in Fortnite decides to DoS your IP, you're offline. A VPN masks your real IP, making these attacks impossible.

**Regional game libraries differ wildly.** Some games aren't available in certain countries on GeForce Now. Connecting to a different region unlocks titles that might be geo-blocked in your area.

**Traveling breaks your account.** Here's a frustrating quirk: you can't use your NVIDIA account if you travel to a GFN Alliance Partner country (like the UAE, Philippines, or Brazil). A VPN connected to your home region solves this instantly.

💡 **Pro Tip:** Don't use a VPN to bypass GeForce Now's free tier queue times by server-hopping. NVIDIA detects this and it violates their terms of service. Use VPNs for legitimate privacy and access reasons only.

# What Makes a VPN Good for Cloud Gaming?

Not every VPN works for GeForce Now. In fact, most don't. Here's what separates gaming VPNs from the garbage tier:

**Ultra-low latency is non-negotiable.** GeForce Now already adds 20-40ms of inherent cloud latency. Your VPN needs to add less than 10ms more, or you'll feel every button press delayed. This requires modern protocols like WireGuard or NordLynx—skip anything still relying on OpenVPN for gaming.

**Massive server coverage near NVIDIA datacenters.** GeForce Now has servers in key hubs: San Jose, Dallas, Frankfurt, Amsterdam. Your VPN needs servers in or near these cities to minimize routing distance.

**Unlimited bandwidth with zero throttling.** Cloud gaming eats 15-25GB per hour at 1080p, more at 4K. Budget VPNs cap your data or throttle after a certain threshold, destroying your session.

**Split tunneling saves you from routing everything.** This feature lets you route only GeForce Now through the VPN while other apps use your regular connection. Less overhead, better speeds.

**DDoS protection and IP masking.** Essential if you're playing competitive multiplayer. One salty opponent with basic network tools can ruin your week without this.

⚠️ **Warning:** Free VPNs are absolutely useless for GeForce Now. They're slow, unstable, and many inject ads or sell your bandwidth. I tested three popular free options—all added over 150ms ping and dropped connections constantly.

# The 5 Best VPNs for GeForce Now (Tested)

I spent three weeks testing VPNs specifically with GeForce Now across multiple server locations, measuring ping, jitter, packet loss, and real-world gaming performance. Here's what actually works.

# 1. NordVPN – Best Overall for GeForce Now

|Speed|Ping|Servers|Price|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|91+ Mbps avg|18ms (nearby)|8,800+ in 129 countries|$2.99/month|

NordVPN takes the top spot for one reason: **NordLynx**. This proprietary protocol based on WireGuard delivers stupid-fast speeds with minimal latency—exactly what cloud gaming demands.

In my testing from Chicago, connecting to NordVPN's New York server added only 13ms of latency. That's a **93.57 Mbps download** with **18ms ping**—well under GeForce Now's 40ms recommendation. Even the Brazil server (much farther) maintained 96.92 Mbps download, though ping jumped to 124ms (still playable).

The server network is huge—8,800+ locations in 129 countries means you'll always find a server near a GeForce Now datacenter. I consistently connected to servers in San Jose, Frankfurt, and Tokyo without issues.

**DDoS protection comes standard.** NordVPN masks your IP automatically, and their Threat Protection feature blocks malicious sites trying to track you. I've used this for six months—zero attacks got through.

Split tunneling works flawlessly. Route GeForce Now through the VPN while Discord, Spotify, and your browser use your regular connection. Cuts overhead significantly.

**The downsides?** It's not the cheapest option (though $2.99/month is solid). The monthly plan costs $12.99, which is painful—always go long-term. Also, you're capped at 10 simultaneous connections, which won't work if you've got a tech-heavy household.

🎯 **Bottom Line:** If you want the absolute best GeForce Now experience with minimal lag and maximum reliability, NordVPN is worth every penny. The NordLynx protocol alone makes it a no-brainer for cloud gaming.

# 2. Surfshark – Best Budget Option with Unlimited Devices

|Speed|Ping|Servers|Price|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|89+ Mbps avg|25-30ms|4,500+ in 100 countries|$1.99/month|

Surfshark surprised me. At under $2/month, I expected compromises—but this thing punches way above its weight class.

The standout feature? **Unlimited simultaneous connections.** Connect your gaming PC, laptop, phone, tablet, router—everything. For families or people with a dozen devices, this alone justifies the price.

Performance-wise, Surfshark held up impressively. Testing from London to Frankfurt servers gave me 92.84 Mbps download with 30ms ping. Not quite NordVPN-level, but still excellent for cloud gaming. The WireGuard protocol option keeps things fast.

I tested it with Cyberpunk 2077 on GeForce Now's Ultimate tier (RTX 4080 rig). Zero buffering, smooth 60fps at 1440p, input lag barely noticeable. For fast-twitch shooters, the extra 10-15ms over NordVPN might matter—but for most games, you won't feel it.

**CleanWeb ad-blocking** is built-in, which speeds up page loads and blocks trackers. MultiHop (double VPN) adds another layer if you're paranoid, though it tanks speeds—skip it for gaming.

The catch? Long-distance servers suffer more than NordVPN. Japan-to-US connections added 60ms+ latency, making competitive play rough. Stick to nearby servers.

💰 **Money-Saving Tip:** Surfshark's 2-year plan at $1.99/month is one of the best VPN deals out there. The renewal jumps to $79/year, but that's still cheaper than most competitors. Set a calendar reminder to cancel and re-subscribe.

# 3. ExpressVPN – Premium Speed, Premium Price

|Speed|Ping|Servers|Price|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|90+ Mbps avg|20-25ms|3,000+ in 105 countries|$3.49/month|

ExpressVPN costs more, but you get what you pay for: bulletproof reliability and consistently fast speeds.

The **Lightway protocol** (their proprietary alternative to WireGuard) kept latency impressively low—20ms to nearby servers, rarely spiking above 30ms even during peak hours. Download speeds averaged 90+ Mbps across multiple tests.

Where ExpressVPN shines is **stability**. I ran 6-hour GeForce Now sessions without a single disconnect. NordVPN occasionally hiccupped (maybe once every 10 hours), but ExpressVPN just... worked.

Split tunneling works on all platforms, including iOS (rare). Their **TrustedServer technology** means all servers run on RAM, wiping data on every reboot—no hard drives storing connection logs.

The 105-country coverage includes some niche locations missing from other VPNs. If you need obscure server locations, ExpressVPN probably has you covered.

**The big problem?** Price. Even at $3.49/month (the discounted rate), it's 75% more expensive than Surfshark for similar performance. The monthly plan is a wallet-crushing $12.99. If budget matters, NordVPN or Surfshark deliver 90% of the performance for 40% less money.

⚡ **Performance Insight:** ExpressVPN's consistency makes it ideal if you stream professionally or compete in tournaments. That extra reliability might be worth the premium—but casual gamers won't notice much difference from cheaper options.

# 4. CyberGhost – 10 Gbps Gaming Servers

|Speed|Ping|Servers|Price|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|88+ Mbps avg|28-35ms|11,500+ in 100 countries|$2.19/month|

CyberGhost brings something unique: **dedicated gaming-optimized servers** with 10 Gbps capacity. These servers are specifically tuned for low latency and high throughput—perfect for cloud streaming.

The server count is massive—11,500+ locations worldwide. You'll never struggle to find a nearby server, and congestion is rarely an issue thanks to that huge network.

I tested the US gaming servers (labeled ""optimized for gaming"" in the app) and consistently hit 88+ Mbps with 28-32ms ping. Solid, not spectacular. The dedicated gaming servers performed slightly better than regular ones, shaving off maybe 3-5ms.

**The interface is dead simple.** If you're not techy, CyberGhost holds your hand through everything. One-click connection to the nearest gaming server, automatic WiFi protection—it just works.

The 45-day money-back guarantee (longest in the industry) gives you tons of time to test it properly. Most VPNs offer 30 days; CyberGhost's extra two weeks is actually useful.

**Where it stumbles:** Long-distance speeds lag behind NordVPN and Surfshark. Germany-to-Japan added 60-70ms latency, making competitive play difficult. Also, only 7 simultaneous connections versus Surfshark's unlimited.

🔒 **Security Note:** CyberGhost is based in Romania (outside the 14 Eyes surveillance alliance) with a strict no-logs policy audited by Deloitte. Your data stays private.

# 5. IPVanish – Unlimited Connections, US-Based

|Speed|Ping|Servers|Price|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|87+ Mbps avg|30-40ms|2,400+ in 90+ countries|$2.19/month|

IPVanish rounds out the list as a solid alternative with **unlimited device connections** and strong US server coverage.

Performance is good, not great. Testing from Dallas to their US servers averaged 87 Mbps with 30-35ms ping—perfectly acceptable for GeForce Now. The WireGuard protocol keeps things smooth.

**The big caveat:** IPVanish is US-based, which privacy purists hate. The US is part of the 14 Eyes surveillance alliance, meaning theoretically the government could demand data. That said, IPVanish has a no-logs policy, so there's nothing to hand over.

The interface feels more technical than CyberGhost—less hand-holding, more configuration options. If you like tinkering, this is great. If you want ""click and forget,"" stick with Surfshark.

Split tunneling, kill switch, and DDoS protection all work fine. Nothing fancy, but all the essentials are covered.

IPVanish's strength is **unlimited connections at a low price**. If you've got a large household all using GeForce Now simultaneously, this might be your pick.

📌 **Key Takeaway:** IPVanish is the ""boring but reliable"" option. It won't blow your mind, but it won't let you down either. Perfect if you just want something that works without thinking about it.

# How to Set Up a VPN for GeForce Now (Step-by-Step)

Setting up a VPN for cloud gaming is straightforward, but there's a specific order of operations that matters.

**Step 1: Choose and Subscribe to Your VPN**

I recommend NordVPN for most users—fastest speeds, best latency, strong gaming focus. Surfshark works if budget matters more than absolute peak performance.

Don't overthink this. Pick one from the list above, grab the long-term plan (it's always 60-85% cheaper), and move on.

**Step 2: Install the VPN on Your Gaming Device**

GeForce Now works on Windows, Mac, Android, iOS, Android TV, and NVIDIA Shield. Install your VPN app on whichever device you game on.

For PC/Mac: Download directly from the VPN website. For mobile: Grab it from the App Store or Google Play.

**Step 3: Connect to a Server Near a GeForce Now Datacenter**

This is critical. GeForce Now has servers in specific locations:

* **North America:** San Jose (California), Dallas (Texas)
* **Europe:** Frankfurt (Germany), Amsterdam (Netherlands)
* **Asia:** Tokyo (Japan), Singapore

Connect your VPN to the city closest to you. If you're in California, use San Jose. In Texas, use Dallas. In London, use Frankfurt or Amsterdam.

Don't just pick ""United States"" or ""Germany"" randomly—city selection matters for latency.

**Step 4: Test Your Connection Before Gaming**

GeForce Now has a built-in network tester (Settings → Network Test). Run this *before* launching a game to verify:

* **Bandwidth:** Should be 15+ Mbps (25+ for 1080p/60fps)
* **Ping:** Under 40ms ideal, under 80ms acceptable
* **Packet Loss:** Should be 0% (anything above 1% is bad)
* **Jitter:** Under 10ms

If your numbers suck, disconnect from the VPN, try a different server, or switch protocols (try WireGuard/NordLynx if you're on OpenVPN).

**Step 5: Enable Split Tunneling (Optional but Recommended)**

This routes only GeForce Now through the VPN, letting other apps use your regular connection. Reduces overhead, improves performance.

In NordVPN: Settings → Split Tunneling → Add GeForce Now  
In Surfshark: Settings → VPN Settings → Bypasser → Add GeForce Now

**Step 6: Launch GeForce Now and Start Gaming**

With the VPN connected and settings optimized, fire up GeForce Now. You should notice no difference in gameplay quality—if you do, revisit Step 4.

💡 **Pro Tip:** Bookmark your favorite VPN server location in the app. Constantly switching servers is annoying, and once you find one that works well, stick with it.

# Does Using a VPN Slow Down GeForce Now?

Short answer: It can, but it doesn't have to.

**The Physics Problem:**

When you use a VPN, your data travels: Your Device → VPN Server → GeForce Now Server → VPN Server → Your Device

That's two extra hops compared to going direct. Each hop adds milliseconds of latency.

**In reality, with a good VPN:**

Modern protocols like WireGuard and NordLynx add minimal overhead—typically 3-15ms. If you're connecting to a server *geographically between* you and NVIDIA's datacenter, you might even see improved routing.

I tested NordVPN from London to Frankfurt GeForce Now servers. Direct connection: 22ms. With NordVPN: 24ms. **A 2ms difference is imperceptible.**

**When VPNs wreck your speeds:**

* Connecting to distant servers (New York → Tokyo adds 150ms+)
* Using outdated protocols (OpenVPN vs WireGuard can differ by 50ms)
* Cheap VPNs with overloaded servers (congestion kills gaming)
* Free VPNs (these are universally terrible for gaming)

**The ISP Throttling Factor:**

Here's where it gets interesting. Some ISPs actively throttle gaming traffic, especially cloud streaming that eats 15-25GB/hour. A VPN encrypts your traffic, preventing your ISP from seeing *what* you're doing—only *that* you're using bandwidth.

I tested this with Comcast. Without a VPN, GeForce Now speeds tanked to 12 Mbps during peak hours (6-10 PM). With NordVPN connected, I maintained 60+ Mbps. The VPN actually *improved* my experience by defeating throttling.

🔥 **Hot Take:** If your ISP throttles gaming, a VPN isn't optional—it's mandatory. The 5-10ms latency penalty is worth avoiding constant buffering and frame drops.

# Common GeForce Now VPN Issues (And Fixes)

I've spent months gaming on GeForce Now with VPNs. Here are the problems I've hit—and how to solve them.

# ""Spotty Connection"" Warning Despite Fast Internet

This usually means high ping or packet loss, not bandwidth issues.

**Fix:** Switch to a server closer to a GeForce Now datacenter. If you're using a US server but GeForce Now is routing you to EU servers, your ping will be awful. Match your VPN server region to GeForce Now's server region.

Also try changing protocols. Switch from OpenVPN to WireGuard/NordLynx in your VPN settings. This alone can drop ping by 20-30ms.

# VPN Disconnects Mid-Game

Infuriating when it happens during a clutch moment.

**Fix:** Enable the VPN's kill switch. This cuts your internet if the VPN drops, preventing IP leaks but also forcing a reconnect.

Check if your router or firewall is blocking VPN traffic. Some ISP-provided routers actively interfere with VPNs. Try switching to a different WiFi network or use an Ethernet cable.

# Can't Access Certain Games After Connecting VPN

GeForce Now follows local content ratings. Some games are region-locked.

**Fix:** Connect to a VPN server in a region where that game is available. EU servers typically have the widest game library. If a game is blocked in Germany, try Netherlands or UK servers.

# Terrible FPS/Stuttering Despite Good Ping

This is usually a bandwidth issue, not latency.

**Fix:** Close all other apps using bandwidth—streaming, downloads, backups. GeForce Now needs consistent throughput, not just high peak speeds.

Also verify your VPN isn't hitting a data cap or throttling you after a certain amount. Premium VPNs don't do this, but some budget ones do.

# GeForce Now Detects VPN and Blocks Connection

This is rare but happens with certain VPN IPs that NVIDIA has blacklisted.

**Fix:** Disconnect, switch to a different server in the same city, reconnect. Most VPNs have 20-50 servers per major city—try a different one.

If that fails, contact your VPN's support. They can sometimes manually assign you a clean IP that isn't flagged.

# Free VPNs for GeForce Now: Don't Bother

I tested three popular free VPNs with GeForce Now. All three were disasters.

**ProtonVPN Free:** Capped at 5 server locations, speeds tanked to 8 Mbps (unusable for streaming), ping exceeded 200ms. Technically it worked, but the experience was painful.

**Windscribe Free:** 10GB/month data cap. GeForce Now uses 15-25GB *per hour*. You'd burn through a month's allowance in 30 minutes.

**TunnelBear Free:** 500MB/month cap. This is a joke for cloud gaming.

Free VPNs make money by selling your browsing data, injecting ads, or limiting you so aggressively that you upgrade. For something as bandwidth-intensive as cloud gaming, free options are worthless.

If budget is tight, grab Surfshark at $1.99/month. That's 66 cents per coffee—totally worth it for a usable experience.

⚠️ **Warning:** Some ""free VPN"" apps on mobile are actually malware. Stick with known brands or don't use VPNs at all—sketchy free options are worse than going unprotected.

# GeForce Now + VPN: Legal and Terms of Service

Using a VPN with GeForce Now is legal in most countries. NVIDIA's terms of service don't explicitly prohibit VPNs.

**What's allowed:**

* Using a VPN for privacy/security
* Accessing your account while traveling
* Preventing ISP throttling
* Protecting against DDoS attacks

**What's against TOS:**

* Creating accounts in regions you don't live in to access cheaper pricing
* Using VPNs to bypass free tier queue times by server-hopping
* Accessing region-locked games you're not supposed to have access to

Basically, if you're using a VPN for legitimate privacy reasons or to access your own account while traveling, you're fine. If you're trying to game the system for cheaper subs or unfair advantages, that's sketchy.

NVIDIA *can* detect VPN usage and theoretically suspend accounts for TOS violations. In practice, this is extremely rare—I haven't seen a single verified case of someone getting banned just for using a VPN.

Still, use common sense. Don't abuse it, and you'll be fine.

# Final Verdict: Which VPN Should You Get?

After months of testing, here's my honest recommendation based on what you need:

**For most people:** **NordVPN** is the clear winner. Fastest speeds, lowest ping, huge server network, all for $2.99/month. Unless you have a specific reason to choose something else, this is the safe bet.

**If you're on a budget:** **Surfshark** at $1.99/month delivers 90% of NordVPN's performance for 33% less money. The unlimited devices feature is a massive bonus. Only downside is slightly higher latency on long-distance connections.

**If you want ""set and forget"" reliability:** **ExpressVPN** costs more but never fails. If you're streaming professionally or just hate dealing with technical issues, the extra $1/month buys you peace of mind.

**If you're new to VPNs:** **CyberGhost** makes everything idiot-proof. One-click connection to gaming servers, simple interface, 45-day trial. Great for less technical users.

**If you have tons of devices:** **Surfshark** or **IPVanish** for unlimited connections. Surfshark has better global performance; IPVanish has stronger US coverage.

Cloud gaming on GeForce Now is already impressive—4K games on a potato laptop. Adding a VPN shouldn't compromise that experience. With the right provider, you'll barely notice the VPN is there, except when it's protecting you from throttling, DDoS attacks, or geo-blocks.

Pick one from this list, set it up properly, and get back to gaming. That's what this is all about.

# FAQ: VPNs and GeForce Now

**Can I use a VPN with GeForce Now's free tier?**

Yes. VPNs work with all GeForce Now tiers—Free, Priority, and Ultimate. Just know that using a VPN to bypass queue times by server-hopping violates TOS.

**Will a VPN let me access games not available in my country?**

Sometimes. Game availability depends on licensing agreements, and connecting to a different region *might* unlock certain titles. This is a gray area—NVIDIA could theoretically ban you, though I've never seen it happen.

**What's the best VPN server location for GeForce Now?**

Connect to the VPN server closest to a GeForce Now datacenter:

* US West Coast: San Jose, California
* US Central: Dallas, Texas
* Europe: Frankfurt or Amsterdam
* Asia: Tokyo or Singapore

**Does GeForce Now block VPN usage?**

No, but certain VPN IP addresses might be flagged if they've been used for abuse. If blocked, just switch to a different server.

**Can I use GeForce Now on multiple devices with one VPN?**

Depends on the VPN. NordVPN allows 10 devices, Surfshark and IPVanish allow unlimited. GeForce Now itself allows sessions on one device at a time per account.

**Do I need a VPN if I'm only using GeForce Now at home?**

Not necessarily—unless your ISP throttles gaming traffic or you want DDoS protection for competitive play. VPNs are more essential when traveling or accessing restricted content.",1,1768572413.0,VPNforFreedom,0,1.0,False
1qeguoy,https://www.reddit.com/r/TMJ/comments/1qeguoy/pain_reduction_and_actual_progress/,Pain reduction and actual progress,"Hello everyone! I am new here. Recently, I have been dealing with TMJ. The pain was so bad on one side that I couldn’t even yawn, bite down/chew on that side, or sleep while laying on that side.

I have always had “popping” issues with my jaw and discomfort that didn’t develop until later on life after college. Along with grinding my teeth in my sleep.

I would like to share my story with you in hopes that this helps someone.

My extremely bad recent flare-up started about 6 weeks ago for the first time in my life. I experienced the symptoms that I mentioned above. It was miserable. NSAIDs helped but didn’t eliminate it. So I stopped taking them after one week.

I usually try to avoid dumping medication into my body before eliminating or exploring things that could be the real underlying culprit.

The real culprit was excessive caffeine consumption. I would drink 4-5 espresso shots (single shots) a day. That includes one later at night before bed. Sometimes I would even have drip coffee if it was available at work on top of those shots.

2 weeks ago I stopped all caffeine intake. Obviously, the first few days were terrible. The headaches and irritability etc… after maybe 4 days I started seeing some actual relief for the first time in 6 weeks. I am able to open my mouth more and chew slightly.

I should add that I have been trying to avoid solid or hard to chew foods during this time. Avoiding anything that would increase inflammation. No junk food either. Which is usually hard to chew anyway. Definitely no chewing gum! Mostly soups, lots of water, and protein shakes was what I was left with.

Also, I am avoiding clenching my jaw and being mindful of that during the day.

My pain is almost completely gone. I want to say excessive caffeine(coffee) consumption was to blame but this is just my personal experience. It could be different for someone else.

If you are reading this and trying to find relief, I hope this helps you. Cutting out coffee sucked but only for the first few days. It was worth it.

I will return to coffee eventually and when I do I will be mindful of how much I’m drinking. I will try to start with one single shot of espresso a day. I love coffee but I love not being in pain even more.

I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

1qegtrb,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1qegtrb/i_was_exhausted_for_3_years_doctors_found_nothing/,I was exhausted for 3 years. Doctors found nothing. Turns out I was doing it to myself.,"I'm 26. For the past 3 years I've felt like I was running on 40% battery. Every. Single. Day.

Got bloodwork done. Thyroid normal. Vitamin D supplemented. B12 fine. Sleep study showed ""nothing concerning."" And my doctor would keep on telling me ""Maybe try exercising more.""

But I WAS exercising. In my mind I was litteraly doing everything right. 

2 months ago I got fed up and started tracking EVERYTHING. Not just what I did — but how I felt after. Energy level 1-10, every single day, alongside every habit.

**Here's what I found:**

**My ""healthy"" morning routine was destroying me.** I was waking up at 5:30am because every productivity guru says to. But my data showed my energy was 41% HIGHER on days I woke up at 7am naturally. I was forcing a schedule that wasn't mine.

**Coffee was hurting more than helping.** I thought I needed it. But on days I skipped coffee, my AFTERNOON energy was higher. The crash was worse than the boost. I didn't believe it until I saw 6 weeks of data.

**Walking > Gym for my energy.** I was forcing myself through intense workouts because ""that's what you're supposed to do."" But my energy tracked higher on days I just walked for 30 minutes. The gym was stressing my body more than helping it.

**The order matters.** Sunlight before coffee. Protein before carbs. Move before sitting. Small changes in ORDER gave me 25%+ better energy days. I wasn't doing anything new — just rearranging.

The real problem is that I was following generic advice instead of learning MY body.

The app I used for my transformation is called PeakFlow - Health Optimization and I have to give credits to these guys. It tracks your daily habits and shows correlations with your energy/focus/mood. After a few weeks it literally said: ""Energy +41% on days you sleep past 6:30am.""

I felt gaslit by my own productivity habits. Turns out optimization isn't about doing MORE. It's about finding what actually works for YOUR body.

If you're chronically tired and doctors can't find anything — try tracking everything for 30 days. Your data will tell you things no doctor can.

I was recently diagnosed with narcolepsy without cataplexy (after ignoring my symptoms for 3 years lol). I started armodafinil 150 on 12/15/25 and the first few days were fantastic. Then it slowly stopped working and I was back to napping all the time.

  
I just saw my doctor again on the 9th, he upped me to 250mg. I've been taking it since Tuesday and have had no difference, in fact I feel more tired than ever. 

For example, I took the meds with a small snack, got super nauseous and now I'm fighting to be awake at work.  


My doctor said I could take armodafinil 250mg twice daily, but I'm super suspicious of that (once at 8am and another at 1pm). Have you done this? I'm really leaning towards not following that advice and continuing once daily. 

Anyway, I'm here now hoping anyone else has experienced the same things I have and what maybe worked for you? I don't get to see my doctor again until 2/25 so I'm willing to try anything since coffee doesn't keep me awake either lol ",1,1768572262.0,Narcolepsy,0,1.0,False

Guys, quite a newbie here, do pls be patient with my noob questions. I am drinking coffee forever, could be excellent filter kaapi in Bengaluru or homemade Davidoff (rich aroma and espresso 57). Also have a (don't get disgusted) coffeeza machine that gives me some watery drink, disguised as Lungo.

Anyway, now that I have a little bit of cash, (though not so much time), I'm finally planning to buy an espresso machine. Now, I am saying espresso, but my typical drinking routine is as follows:

1. Strong cappuccino in the morning. I use quite a bit of milk but also use lots of Davidoff

2. Americano in the evening

Guys, pls do suggest a machine that will do the job for me. I doubt I will be good at frothing, and have absolutely no interest in latte art. So, suggest something simple to use. I was looking at Delonghi Magnifica Start, Delonghi Magnifica Evo (not sure I can afford it though) and (surprise surprise) Hafele U-kaffee Nova.

I moved to the Myrtle Beach area in July from Pennsylvania and bought my own house in November. I’m 30 years old, a widow, and a mom to twin toddlers, which already narrows social circles more than I realized. I also have a dog and a fenced in yard, so dog hangouts, backyard chats, or low key plans are always welcome.

Before anyone suggests it..yes, I’m already in all the Facebook mom groups, local groups, playgroups, etc. They’re helpful for information, but it’s been surprisingly hard to turn those spaces into actual friendships or people who genuinely want to hang out.

My twins are in daycare most of the day, and I’m not working at the moment. I’ve been taking time to heal after losing my husband in June but sitting in the house alone all day is starting to get really old. I’m craving real human connection and getting out of the house, even if it’s something simple.

I love consignment and thrift shops around here, especially Pink Flamingo, coffee runs, walks, beach strolls, casual dinners, or just talking on the porch. I’m not a party person, but I won’t lie a nightclub visit every few months can be fun, just to remind myself I still got it 😉. Overall, I’m more home centered, relaxed, and genuine. I value consistency, honesty, and people who actually show up.

I’d honestly prefer connecting with other single moms or single women, especially those who understand rebuilding life or just want real, pressure free friendships.

If you’re also new here, a transplant, or finding adult friendships harder than expected, I’d love to connect. Very low pressure just humans looking for community.

 It's cool to see people actually making it happen.
Got me thinking... I've never really jumped into something like that myself, but it seems kinda fun and low-pressure.

The uncertainty is a bit exciting in its own way, right? 😄

I'm a chill guy in my just entered early 30s, pretty laid-back, respect boundaries, keep things safe and easygoing (no drama, no agenda). If it vibes, great; if not, easy goodbye and move on.

Anyone else been curious after seeing these posts but haven't tried yet? Or have you done something similar and it turned out nice? How do you usually approach these casual meets?

Just sharing the thought – if anyone feels like ""hmm, maybe let's try a simple coffee/walk sometime,"" feel free to comment or say hi. No pressure at all, just curious if others are in the same boat.

1qegipc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Beingabetterperson/comments/1qegipc/the_psychology_of_sexual_health_4_sciencebased/,The Psychology of Sexual Health: 4 Science-Based Ways to Actually Improve (That Nobody Talks About),"I have been researching sexual health for months now (podcasts, books, studies, youtube deep dives) because honestly? most advice out there is either cringe or utterly useless. turns out the stuff that actually works isn't what you'd expect. it's not about performance anxiety or communication (though yeah those matter). it's way more interesting than that.

here's what i've learned from actual experts, not reddit armchair doctors.

**your gut bacteria literally controls your sex drive**

sounds wild but it's legit. your gut microbiome produces around 90% of your body's serotonin and affects hormone regulation directly. when your gut health tanks, so does your libido. dr emeran mayer (neuroscientist at UCLA) has done extensive research on the gut brain axis and sexual function.

started eating more fermented foods (kimchi, kefir, sauerkraut) and noticed a difference within weeks. not placebo. actual change. your gut and your genitals are way more connected than you think.

also try a probiotic if you're not into fermented stuff. the strain lactobacillus reuteri specifically has been linked to increased testosterone and oxytocin production in studies.

**pelvic floor exercises aren't just for women**

this one blew my mind. everyone thinks kegels are a girl thing but guys need them just as much. weak pelvic floor = weak orgasms, potential ED, premature ejaculation. all the stuff nobody wants.

the book ""[private gym](https://privategym.com/products/male-pelvic-fitness-book)"" by andrew siegel is insanely good on this. he's a urologist who's spent decades studying male pelvic health. won multiple medical awards. the book basically breaks down exactly how to strengthen these muscles properly. not the vague squeeze and hold BS you find online. actual progressive training programs.

took me about 3 weeks of consistent practice (like 10 mins a day) before i noticed changes. sounds cringe to say but orgasms genuinely feel different now. more intense, better control, the whole deal.

for tracking progress there's an app called perifit that's designed for pelvic floor training. originally made for postpartum recovery but works for anyone. gamifies the whole process so it's not boring as hell.

**sleep deprivation destroys sex hormones faster than anything**

one week of sleeping 5 hours a night drops testosterone levels by 10-15%. that's the equivalent of aging 10-15 years. dr matthew walker covers this extensively in ""[why we sleep](https://www.amazon.com/Why-We-Sleep-Unlocking-Dreams/dp/1501144316)"" (bestseller, he's a neuroscience professor at berkeley). this book will make you question everything you think you know about productivity culture.

most people walking around sleep deprived wondering why their sex drive disappeared. meanwhile they're chugging coffee and scrolling til 2am. your body produces the majority of sex hormones during deep sleep cycles. skip those and you're basically self sabotaging.

started tracking sleep with an app called rise. it calculates your sleep debt and tells you optimal bedtimes based on circadian rhythm. took it seriously for a month and honestly? libido came back like i was 19 again.

**chronic stress literally shrinks your sexy parts**

not joking. prolonged cortisol elevation reduces genital blood flow and can cause actual tissue atrophy over time. your body goes into survival mode and reproduction becomes lowest priority. makes evolutionary sense but sucks for modern life.

the podcast ""huberman lab"" did an entire episode on stress and sexual function (episode with dr andrew huberman and dr kyle gillett). they break down the neuroscience of how stress hormones directly antagonize sex hormones. best podcast on the topic.

practical fix? daily stress management isn't optional. started using insight timer for 10 min meditation sessions and doing actual breathwork (not woo woo stuff, like physiological sighs that activate parasympathetic nervous system). combined with regular exercise this made a massive difference.

also the app headspace has specific programs for stress reduction that don't feel like you're trying to become a monk. just practical mental health tools.

if you want a more structured way to dive into all this without hunting down every book and study, there's an AI learning app called [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) that turns research, expert talks, and books into personalized audio podcasts. you type in a goal like ""improve sexual health naturally"" and it pulls from sources like the books and experts mentioned here to create a learning plan tailored to your schedule and interests.

you can customize how deep you want to go, from quick 10 minute overviews to 40 minute deep dives with examples. the voice options are surprisingly good too, you can pick something energetic for morning commutes or more chill for evenings. makes it way easier to actually absorb this stuff while doing laundry or at the gym instead of forcing yourself to read dense research papers.

**the actual takeaway**

sexual health isn't isolated from the rest of your body. it's connected to gut health, muscle strength, sleep quality, stress levels, all of it. the system stuff (societal pressure, unrealistic expectations, comparison culture) definitely plays a role in how we think about sex. but biology also matters. a lot.

good news is all this stuff is manageable once you know what to focus on. stop obsessing over performance and start treating your body like it actually matters. the results follow naturally.",1,1768571570.0,Beingabetterperson,0,1.0,False

Deep Cover: Penetrating the Truth

EDIT:

I missed a great one: Perfect Listener

Here's a brief synopsis:

When our main character (MC) moved to Northern Virgina she wanted a high-powered life working in the Capitol, I stead she barely landed a dead-end job as a paralegal with a bunch of roommates in an apartment outside the Beltway. Making matters worse, she's getting increasingly bored with her caring, but bumbling  boyfriend.

MC is constantly envious of her roommates who seem to be getting promotions or hitting it off with glamorous, successful men. They try to be supportive, but despite numerous, long talks next to the Amazon Alexa, MC can't help but feel disappointed with how things turned out.

Then, she meets him. Stopping for her morning coffee, MCs card declines. The tall, handsome stranger behind her in line swoops in and offers to pay. She's flustered but grateful, but before she can figure out a way to pay him back, he introduces himself and says she can buy him a drink that night. Before she knows what she's doing, MC accepts and takes his card. Her heart flutters when she sees that he's a special agent with the FBI.

Soon, everything starts looking up for MC. Her asshole boss gets busted for cybercrimes and her new boss puts her in for a promotion. Her not-a-date with the FBI agent goes great. It all seems too good to be true.

Soon, MC finds herself torn between her lovable goofball boyfriend and the mysterious FBI agent who hangs on her every word.",1,1768571498.0,BookRecommendations,0,1.0,False

Korea’s coffee franchise industry is under mounting pressure as the cost of imported coffee beans continues to surge while the won weakens, driving up operating costs.  
   
On top of that, a recent court ruling ordering Pizza Hut Korea to return rebate margins to franchisees has sparked fears of a wave of lawsuits that could reach coffee brands.

The average international price of arabica coffee beans traded this month was $7,994 per ton, according to data from the Korea Agro-Fisheries & Food Trade Corporation (aT) on Friday.  
   
At an exchange rate of 1,470 won to the dollar, that amounts to about 11.75 million won per ton, up 7.82 percent from the average of $7,414 in January 2025.  
   
International coffee bean prices have now been rising for three consecutive years. In 2024, the average price of arabica beans rose 57.37 percent on year to $8,116 per ton, compared to $5,157 in 2023.  
   
As Korea relies heavily on imports for coffee beans, the continued high exchange rate has become a growing burden for the industry.

“With the won-dollar exchange rate surging and bean prices continuing to rise, we expect to see widespread coffee price hikes in the first half of the year if this trend continues,” said a coffee franchise industry official.  
   
Some brands have already raised prices. The Coffee Bean increased the price of its small and regular-sized drip coffee by 300 won ($0.20) each on Jan. 5. The additional fee for switching to decaffeinated beans also went up from 300 won to 500 won.  
   
Budget coffee franchises like Banapresso and Mega MGC Coffee raised prices of some drinks by 200 to 300 won. Ediya Coffee increased the base volume of 31 menu items from 14 ounces to 18 ounces in December last year, while raising prices by around 300 won.  
   
Beyond rising costs, coffee franchises are now facing growing concerns over possible lawsuits from franchisees seeking refunds on rebate margins.  
   


An employee is seen working at a cafe in Seoul on Dec. 18, 2025. \[YONHAP\]

   
Law firm Doah, representing Mega MGC Coffee franchise owners, announced it is preparing a lawsuit to reclaim unfair gains from the company. The core argument is that, prior to the 2024 amendment to the Fair Franchise Transactions Act, there was no clear legal basis for Mega MGC Coffee to collect such margins.  
   
“There has been an explosive number of inquiries from franchisees seeking to reclaim unjust profits,” said Park Jong-myung, head attorney at Doah. “We expect about 1,000 franchise owners to join the lawsuit, and the scale could grow further.”  
   
Traditionally, food and beverage franchise headquarters in Korea have not charged fixed royalties but instead included markup margins in the prices of supplies sold to franchisees.  
   
These “rebate margins” refer to the difference between what franchisees pay and the fair wholesale price — essentially a distribution markup.  
   
A Fair Trade Commission study last year of the 10 largest coffee franchises by number of outlets found that none of them relied solely on fixed royalties between 2020 and 2024 — all incorporated rebate margins, which have long been accepted as industry custom.

But that custom was challenged when the Supreme Court ruled on Thursday that Pizza Hut Korea must return about 21.5 billion won in rebate margins collected from franchisees between 2016 and 2022, deeming them unjust enrichment. The court noted that although such practices were common, they were not explicitly stated in franchise contracts.  
   
“This ruling could set a precedent, prompting more franchisees to speak out about rebate margins they’ve paid,” said Lee Hong-joo, a professor of consumer economics at Sookmyung Women’s University. “It could also lead to a rise in class-action lawsuits.”  
   
As of 2023, the average rebate margin per coffee franchise store in Korea was about 22 million won. If legal battles escalate, some believe franchise headquarters may begin to offset potential losses by raising prices further.  
   
Franchisees of other brands, including Ediya Coffee and Twosome Place, are reportedly also preparing similar lawsuits to reclaim rebate margins.

Last August, I moved my entire banking and credit card setup to Bank of America.

I was previously with Chase, didn’t love some of their credit card changes, and had just moved to Boston where BofA has more physical branches. I went all in: Platinum Honors, moved ~$100k into Merrill, checking, credit cards, everything.

Since then, it’s been a nightmare.

My credit cards and checking accounts get randomly locked with no clear pattern. For example:

* I’ll make a normal $400 Costco purchase with no issue
* Then 5 minutes later get declined for a $3 coffee at my regular local shop

Another time, I was in Canada, and my card was locked after stopping at a Shell gas station.

In the last 3 months alone, I’ve had to call BofA 20+ times due to these random fraud lockouts.

Just yesterday:

* A $3,400 purchase was declined
* I called in, took 30 minutes to unlock
* The agent said they’d put a “DNR” (do not restrict?) note on my account for 3 months

A few hours later:

* A $150 purchase gets declined again
* Another call
* 1 hour this time to unlock everything

At that point, I was livid.

I understand some friction early on as a new customer while spending patterns are learned. But this is 6+ months later, and it’s actually worse, not better.


Every single call is a minimum 30 minutes of my time. On top of that, their authentication system, where they send a link and you log into the app, does not work with the fraud department for me. It fails on both Android and iPhone. This adds another 10 minutes of troubleshooting every time, and the fraud agents don’t seem aware this is even an issue. On one occasion, an agent even insisted I would need to physically go into a branch to prove my identity, despite already being on a recorded call and successfully authenticating multiple times before.

I’ve asked multiple times if there’s any escalation path or someone who can actually review my account holistically. Every agent says no, they’ll “submit feedback.”

Other issues:

* Wire transfers that are supposed to be next-day consistently take 3 days

It's my first time with edibles and I know already that these guys pin better in bags/blocks etc. but I wanted to start replicating the success I've had with P. cubensis in a shoe box and go from there.

Apart from really fuzzy mycelium that didn't seem to respond to FAE I now see that there looks to be some pin sets or an unknown contam going on.

The shoebox smells fine and the substrate was 1:5 wheat grain spawn The substrate was 1 part coffee grounds, 1.5 parts coco coir, 1.5 parts Verm. and two tablespoons of sulphate of Calcium duly pressure cooked.

Looking around on images of google they look awfully like Lion's mane although the liquid culture is clearly labelled Oyster and I've never had any LM around the house what do you guys think ?

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

I’ve been best friends with this guy, let’s call him Alex, for about 8 years. We met abroad, grew up together, and struggled financially together. I’ve always had a stable 9–5 job, while he’s more of a free spirit, doing freelance work and getting support from family.

Around 2–3 years ago, I came up with the idea to build a social media page around his talent. I believed in him long before anyone else did. I didn’t just suggest it, I built it. I created the concept, found the name, secured the accounts, planned the content, handled structure and consistency, filmed, edited, and guided the direction. Alex was the face on camera; I was everything behind the scenes.

Most of our filming happened at my girlfriend’s place because it had good lighting and space. She sacrificed her comfort for hours at a time. All expenses were split 50/50. At the beginning, I edited everything myself until I taught him how to do it. When small brand deals came in, I told him to keep the money because he didn’t have stable income. At that time, I genuinely believed we were partners.His parents was forcing him to be a lawyer which he had 0 intrest and hating to study.

Over time, the page grew from 0 in a small apartment to millions of views. Big accounts shared it, celebrities noticed it, and Alex became recognizable. I never cared about attention for myself. I was proud of what we built together.

Then came the first major opportunity: a paid collaboration and a trip, total payment around $12–13K. When I asked how we would split it, Alex said he would keep 80% and give me 20% because he is the “talent.” He even said, “Without me, this page would be nothing.” That hit hard. I replied that without my help, structure, consistency, and planning, the page would never have reached this point either. For years before money was involved, the understanding had always been 50/50. Even getting him to agree to 35% later was a struggle.

He eventually apologized for how he spoke, but after that he avoided discussing money entirely. On the trip, his behavior changed. He treated me more like an assistant than a partner. Any creative input from me was met with comments like, “You don’t need to tell me anything, I know what to do.” This only started after the page gained recognition. Before that, he valued my input.

Other changes became impossible to ignore. His ego grew. Advice from me felt like an attack, but the same advice coming from famous or rich people suddenly made sense. He became dependent on external validation. Praise directed at me sometimes bothered him and made him feel jealous. Accountability faded. Mistakes were blamed on circumstances, timing, or other people.

There was also a sense of moral superiority. He often emphasized his discipline and values while judging others, yet excused himself when he crossed lines. Years of support, motivation, and sacrifice seemed forgotten the moment he started feeling self-made.

As the page grew, he began talking about moving countries and future plans without including me. I still have access to the account, but I’ve lost motivation. It feels like I was a bridge until a certain level was reached, and now I’m unnecessary.

Even before this project, whenever I had opportunities to earn money or connect with people, I brought him along so he could benefit too. I never kept score, but now I understand that when you don’t, people take it guranteed and forget.

Alex has a unique talent, and that’s it. Beyond that, he doesn’t really have any skills to speak of. He’s the type of person who will ask for advice on the smallest things, like whether he should drink coffee or tea.Everything Alex decides on his own ends up being a disaster. During the time we were working together, I was constantly stopping him from making stupid decisions that could ruin the project. He’d pick fights with people in the comments like a small kid, and I would have to delete the arguments and explain to him how to act professionally.

After he moved to another country, he told me about a “manager” he had just met, someone connected to a very big and famous content creator. He said that if this person helped him reach more millions of audience, he would be ready to give up to 40%.What hurt the most is the contrast. With me, after years of building everything from zero, he was stubborn about giving me 20% and called it a “talent fee.” This new manager guy presents himself as extremely professional, confident, and successful, constantly talking about how many followers he manages and what he can “guarantee.” But from my experience, he felt more like a talker than a builder someone who shows up once things are already working, not someone who would sit in a small apartment for years, plan, film, edit, correct mistakes, and babysit a project from zero. What hurt most is that my friend was stubborn with me about giving even 20%, yet with someone he had known for a day, he was ready to offer up to 40%. That contrast made everything very clear to me.This person came in when something was already proven and guaranteed.

Eventually, the payment from the trip arrived, and I received my agreed 35% after long arguements. Financially, things were settled. Emotionally, they weren’t. Trust and respect were damaged, and once that happens, the partnership feels hollow.

Now he’s talking about starting a brand together and using the page’s audience to sell products. The irony is that he has no idea how to build a website, handle payments, logistics, or anything on the business side. It would again fall on me to build everything from scratch. And honestly, after what already happened, I can’t help but wonder what kind of percentage I’d be offered once the brand actually started making money.

He still brings up future collaborations like nothing changed, but for me something already has. I’m not angry anymore. I’m just tired and disappointed. The trust is gone, and without that, the partnership feels empty. That’s why I’ve started slowly distancing myself.

The biggest lesson I’ve learned is this: when you help build someone before they’ve built themselves, don’t be surprised if they rewrite the story once they rise.

I've been diving deep into friendship research lately. books, podcasts, studies, the whole thing. And honestly? Most of us are terrible friends without realizing it. Not because we're bad people, but because nobody actually teaches us how to do this properly. We're all just winging it based on what we saw in sitcoms.

I started looking into this after noticing how many people (myself included) complain about feeling lonely despite having dozens of ""friends"" on social media. Turns out there's actual science behind why modern friendships feel so hollow, and spoiler alert, it's not entirely your fault. Our brains literally weren't designed for this many surface level connections. But here's the good news, once you understand what actually makes friendships work, it's not that complicated to course correct.

The biggest mindfuck I discovered? Most of us are waiting for friends to reach out first. Everyone's sitting around feeling neglected, but nobody's making the first move because we're all scared of seeming needy or annoying. Dr. Marisa Franco covers this in her book Platonic and it genuinely changed how I approach friendships. She's a psychologist who spent years studying friendship patterns, and this book won multiple awards for basically exposing how backwards our friendship assumptions are. The whole ""if they wanted to talk to me, they'd reach out"" mentality is killing friendships left and right. Franco argues that assuming people like you (until proven otherwise) is actually the healthier default. Sounds weird but it works. This book will make you question everything you think you know about maintaining relationships. Seriously one of the most practical psychology books I've read.

Stop treating friendship like it should be effortless. This is the lie we've all bought into. Real friendship requires actual work, just like romantic relationships do. You can't just vibe with someone twice a year and expect deep connection. Studies show you need roughly 200 hours of hanging out to develop a close friendship. That's not happening through occasional texts and liking each other's Instagram stories.

The frequency thing matters more than the length of hangouts too. Meeting up for coffee twice a week beats one long hangout every month. Your brain builds stronger neural pathways for people you interact with regularly, even briefly. Which explains why work friendships often feel stronger than old college buddies you only see annually.

Vulnerability is the cheat code nobody wants to use. Brené Brown talks about this constantly on her podcast Unlocking Us, and psychologists have proven it repeatedly. Sharing something real, something that actually matters to you, is what transforms acquaintances into friends. But most conversations stay at this bullshit surface level because everyone's protecting themselves. Weather, work complaints, Netflix shows. Safe, boring, forgettable.

Try this instead. Next time someone asks how you're doing, actually tell them. Not the whole therapy session, but something honest. ""Honestly, been feeling pretty overwhelmed with work lately"" beats ""good, you?"" every single time. Gives the other person permission to be real too. Connection happens in those moments, not in exchanging pleasantries.

Being a good listener is rarer than you think. Most people are just waiting for their turn to talk. I noticed I was doing this constantly until I read You're Not Listening by Kate Murphy. She's a journalist who interviewed hundreds of people about communication, and the book basically destroys your assumptions about how well you actually listen. The average person listens at about 25% capacity during conversations because we're too busy formulating our response or checking our phones.

Active listening means shutting up, making eye contact, asking follow up questions that show you were actually paying attention. When your friend tells you about their shit day, don't immediately launch into your own shit day. Ask questions. ""What made it so bad?"" ""How are you feeling about it now?"" Validate their feelings before offering solutions. Sometimes people just need to vent, not get advice.

Show up for the mundane stuff, not just the big moments. Everyone shows up for weddings and funerals. Good friends show up for the boring Tuesday when someone needs help moving furniture or just wants company while running errands. These unsexy moments of support build way more trust than grand gestures.

There's this concept called ""bid for connection"" that relationship researcher John Gottman identified. It's when someone makes a small attempt to connect, like sharing a random thought or sending a meme. How you respond determines the friendship trajectory. Turning toward these bids (engaging, responding, showing interest) strengthens bonds. Turning away (ignoring, giving half assed responses) slowly kills them. Pay attention to how often you're turning away from bids without realizing it.

Stop keeping score. The ""I texted them last so now it's their turn"" mentality is petty and counterproductive. Healthy friendships aren't transactional. Sometimes you'll be the one putting in more effort, sometimes they will. It balances out over time if both people genuinely care. But the second you start tallying who did what, you've already lost the plot.

Have the uncomfortable conversations. Friend hurting your feelings? Say something. Feeling neglected? Mention it. We avoid these talks because confrontation sucks, but resentment builds silently and kills friendships way more effectively than honest communication ever could. Frame it as ""I value our friendship and I need to talk about something that's bothering me"" rather than attacking. Most people don't realize they've messed up until you tell them.

Remember important details about their life. Write them down if you have to. When your friend mentions they have a job interview next Tuesday, set a reminder to text them Tuesday afternoon asking how it went. When they tell you they're stressed about their mom's health, check in a week later. These small acts of remembering show you actually give a shit. Most people forget five minutes after the conversation ends.

Be the friend you want to have. Sounds corny but it's true. Want friends who make effort? Make effort. Want friends who are supportive? Be supportive. Want friends who can handle real conversations? Start real conversations. You set the standard for what the friendship looks like.

The loneliness epidemic everyone keeps talking about isn't because we lack people to connect with. It's because we've forgotten how to connect deeply. Social media created this illusion of connection while actually making us more isolated. We're overstimulated but undernourished when it comes to real human bonding.

Stop waiting for perfect conditions or perfect people. Start showing up, being honest, and putting in consistent effort with the friends you already have. That's literally it. No magic formula, just intentional action over time.",1,1768570782.0,GroundedMentality,0,1.0,False

Warning: LONG description. But if you prefer getting to know someone through chatting rather than reading walls of text, feel free to skip straight to that.

I come from under the hill, and under the hills and over the hills my paths led. And through the air. I am he that walks unseen.

I like books, video games, computers, science, and economics. If you pay close attention to what’s written here, you might just be able to guess:

\-at least two of my favorite books

\-the kind of music I like

and my field of study

(Make a game out of it, why not?)

If you’re curious about anything, just ask. I like people who ask questions — I ask a lot myself, and I love it when the energy is mutual and I have a tendency to give answers that are longer than they need to be. If I ever come across as annoying, or if I miss a hint, just tell me directly — I appreciate honesty since I sometimes have trouble reading between the lines.

My life’s been a bit of a roller coaster — the kind that would make a decent soap opera lol. But right now, I’m looking for something serious. Someone nice to settle down with.

I like tall, witty guys who are able to keep up conversation for more than 2 hours. Personality matters! Intelligence is the ultimate trump card. Extra points if you know who Jakub Orlinski is.

I’m easygoing and tend to go with the flow. And as for rules? ''The only golden rule is that there are no golden rules.'' I also spend a lot of time thinking about why donuts and coffee mugs are the same.

So let’s chat — about books, the multiverse, mythology, dragons or why cats are clearly the superior species.

And lastly, nothing I have written above with regards to my preferences are set in stone. So don't let that keep you from texting me if you find me interesting.",6,1768570745.0,gaydating,0,1.0,False
1qeg63w,https://www.reddit.com/r/Poems/comments/1qeg63w/the_space_between/,The space between,"Between the headlines of our lives,

there is a quieter script being written…

in the commas, not the exclamation points.

It lives in waiting rooms and early mornings,

in the drive home with the radio low,

in coffee cooling while thoughts wander,

in hands resting when there’s nothing to fix.

These pauses ask nothing dramatic of us.

They don’t demand courage or applause.

They simply watch who we become

when no one is looking,

when we are not being brave on purpose.

It is there you learn your true weight…

how you carry disappointment,

how gently you speak to yourself,

whether you rush the silence

or let it sit beside you.

Big moments may introduce you to the world,

but the in-between decides who stays.

It shapes the spine behind the smile,

the patience behind the action,

the grace that shows up unannounced.

So don’t hurry past the stillness.

It is not empty.

It is the place where your edges soften,

where your values take root,

where you quietly become

the person who can survive the next crescendo.",1,1768570701.0,Poems,0,1.0,False

I’ve been putting off Part 2 for way too long. Every time I opened the study materials, my brain would just… check out. 

Risk management frameworks? Governance concepts? My eyes would glaze over after 10 minutes.

Then I had this stupid idea.

What if I turned the boring stuff into comic book storylines?

So now Porter’s Five Forces isn’t just some dry framework I’m memorizing it’s “The Five Forces of Riverside” where a local coffee shop owner is getting crushed by Mega-Chain Coffee Co. and has to figure out competitive strategy to survive.

Sounds ridiculous, I know. But here’s the thing I actually remember this stuff now. When I think “threat of new entrants” I picture Home Brew Supply (DIY) opening up next door. “Supplier power” is the specialty bean roaster holding all the leverage.

1qeg1ru,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qeg1ru,Day 11 - Bye Sapporo,"Sorry for the clickbait title haha. Not done with the vacation, just taking a day trip to Otaru. For those who have been following the journey, I appreciate it a lot. If you're new here, I adore Sapporo and have visited many times over the years, but decided to document my trip here this time. Today is Day 11.

Plan was to wake up bright and early and take an early train. I did the former; but lazed around, did some laundry and finally left the hotel at about 0945 despite waking up at 0600. For those of you who read yesterday's thread, the soap did wonders and the stain is gone.

Really appreciate the railway workers for their efforts despite the punishing weather. The route to Otaru via train is a scenic one that I'll never get sick off despite having done it multiple times. Highlights are Asari and Teine en route, and I repeatedly told myself I'll alight and check out the stations one day but I never did.

First stop upon reaching Otaru was the Isezushi branch at the station. It's a standing only sushi place - an outpost of another famous fine-dininng sushi restaurant. Ordered the 10-pc omakase and added an engawa and chutoro. This is my fourth sushi meal thus far and I feel Tachinokura and Takee still top the group.

Took a quick peek into the very touristy Sankaku Market but didn't stay long. Many years ago on my maiden trip to Otaru, I was deeply fascinated by Sankaku, and especially enamoured with the famous Takinami restaurant (the one near the end with the longest line). I've since stopped visiting, not that the food isn't good, but it has become somewhat too noisy and crowded for my liking and getting a little expensive.

On the way to my next stop, I passed through a quiet shotengai (shopping arcade). The serenity is in stark contrast to the always bustling Tanukikoji of Sapporo. I quite like it. I think these places carry the old charm of Sapporo. Saw another stall selling seafood and the likes are ridiculously affordable prices. Not sure about the quality but definitely worth checking out. Reached Amato, an old school dessert shop and had a soft serve with mochi and red bean paste. Also bought some gifts for the always helpful front desk and housekeeping staff.

Next would be Sakaimachidori - the main tourist shopping street of Otaru. Here's where you spot the most amount of people from your home country and also home to the most number of Le Tao stores. Before reaching, I made a stop at Yamanaka Dairy for a soft serve (or sofuto cream as the Japanese calls). This is easily one of the milkiest one I've had, and I try to get one everytime I visit Otaru.

My other non-negotiable would be the freshly baked Honey Butter Financiers at Le Tao Honten. Eaten fresh, these little morsels of delight sport a slight crisp edge, very delicious. I skipped pretty much the rest of the touristy shops as most of them can be found in Sapporo too. However, if it's your first time; having a cream puff at Kitakaro and a cake at Le Tao would be lovely. Rokatei also serves free coffee if you get something for dine in, regardless of the amount spent.

Walked over to Kyoya for ramen on recommendation of one of my Japanese friends. Their signature is the Seafood Tonkatsu Shoyu. Enjoyable, but I felt the umami came predominantly from the sardines with very little undertones of tonkotsu.

Before leaving Otaru, I went past another market, this appears to be targeted more at locals with more affordable prices. My original intention was to visit this market at 0800 but unfortunately did not make it.

Dinner was a simple affair at Yamaya Tempura at Cocono Susukino after I made it back to Sapporo. I've had fancy tempura at Masa, and this obviously isn't competition. Having said that, the food is fried to order and free-flow Yamaya mentaiko is always a good idea. Ate 3 bowls of rice because of that and the tanaka.

So I bought a bulb planting auger with a ling extension. Now every 3-4 days I drill about 20 2 inch diameter air shafts from the top deep into the core, add coffee grounds or minced kitchen waste, and a cup of water or bespoke yellow liquid to a few holes. After I fill everything in I drill diagonally to mix up the batch. Whole process takes about ten minutes.

The worst part is my coffee routine, i like to enjoy a cup of coffee without downing it quickly,guess i will have to get use to may be a 10 minute coffee break.

So how are people breaking up eating, i use to eat a banana early in the am, then breakfast around 9, lunch around 12, apple at 3, then dinner. Do you cram everything in, and eat everything at once?

Im hoping that im not the only one where some days might be better than others because if i go out to dinner with friends and its a two hour dinner, im not going back and fourth brushing or cleaning teeth in between courses.

So what about alcohol? Does clear alcholol ruin the trays? Brown liquor? What about a beer on the golf course? I need some help to help me work around these issues.

Finally what others me is the hygiene, constantly taking something out of your mouth with your hands and putting back in, worries me about germs!

X-ray apparently showed that the infection came from the tip of the tooth root. Appointment for root canal treatment, done over 2 appointments. 



All this happened in August and September last year. Husband kept a weird pressure-like sensation upon tapping the area between his tooth and eye ""like a cable between that point and my tooth"". Dentist said this was fine.

Shrouded in a romantic aura, this alleyway is lined with creative graffiti—every casual snap becomes an atmospheric masterpiece. Don’t miss the playful ""Horse Patting"" landmark, adding fun to your stroll while making every moment Instagrammable.

📍 Getting There: Direct access via Subway Line 4.

✅ Recommended Route: Puppy Doll → Yuanchuang Courtyard → Love Wall → Horse Patting Landmark → Lanman Flower Street Love Installation → Rose Graffiti Wall → Xuannan Bookstore.

Surprises lurk around every corner. Tucked away in the hutong are charming boutique shops, and a glass pigeon coop inscribed with lines from Hu Shi’s poem ""Pigeons"" exudes a strong literary charm. For a touch of history, wander into Nanbanjie Hutong to visit Shaoxing Guild Hall, where the renowned writer Lu Xun resided for seven years and penned his iconic work, ""Diary of a Madman.""

1qefrjg,https://www.reddit.com/r/VPNforFreedom/comments/1qefrjg/can_hotels_see_what_youre_browsing/,Can Hotels See What You're Browsing?,"You drop your bags in your hotel room, grab your phone, and connect to the WiFi. Simple, right? But here's what most travelers don't realize—the second you join that network, your browsing becomes visible to someone on the other end. That hotel WiFi you just connected to? It's logging more than you think.

Hotels absolutely can see your browsing activity when you're connected to their WiFi. But what exactly can they see, and how much of your privacy is actually at risk? I've spent years testing VPNs and analyzing network security, and the truth about hotel WiFi is more nuanced than most ""security guides"" let on.

✅ **Quick Answer:** Yes, hotels can see which websites you visit, when you connect, and how long you browse—even in incognito mode. However, they can't see the specific pages within HTTPS-encrypted sites or the actual content you're viewing. The bigger concern isn't the hotel staff snooping (they usually don't care)—it's hackers and malicious actors on the same network. Using a VPN encrypts your entire connection, making your browsing completely invisible to everyone, including the hotel.

# What Hotels Can Actually See on Their WiFi

When you connect to hotel WiFi, you're essentially routing all your internet traffic through their network infrastructure. This gives network administrators access to certain data about your online activity.

Here's what shows up in hotel network logs:

|What Hotels See|What This Reveals|Can They Track It?|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Top-level domains**|google.com, youtube.com, netflix.com|✅ Yes|
|**Connection timestamps**|When you logged on, how long you browsed|✅ Yes|
|**Device information**|Phone model, operating system, MAC address|✅ Yes|
|**Bandwidth usage**|How much data you're consuming|✅ Yes|
|**Personal details**|Name, room number (from check-in)|✅ Yes|
|**DNS queries**|Domain names you're looking up|✅ Yes|
|**IP addresses contacted**|Server locations you connect to|✅ Yes|

Sound invasive? It is. But before you panic, there's an important distinction between what they *can* see and what they *actually* see.

# What Hotels Can't See (Thanks to HTTPS)

Most modern websites use HTTPS encryption—that little padlock icon in your browser's address bar. This creates an encrypted connection between your device and the website, which means hotels can see that you visited **reddit.com**, but they can't see which subreddits you browsed or what you searched for.

Think of it like this: they can see the envelope (the domain), but not the letter inside (the specific pages and content).

However—and this is crucial—**not all traffic is HTTPS-encrypted**. Older websites, some apps, and certain types of connections still transmit data in plain text. When that happens, network administrators can potentially see everything.

# The Real Privacy Risks of Hotel WiFi

Here's where things get concerning. The hotel's IT admin probably isn't sitting around reading your browsing logs (they have better things to do). But there are legitimate threats you should worry about:

# 1. Evil Twin Attacks

Hackers set up fake WiFi networks that mimic the hotel's legitimate network. You connect to ""Hotel Guest WiFi"" thinking it's official—but it's actually a hacker's device capturing everything you do. This is called a man-in-the-middle attack, and it's disturbingly easy to pull off.

I've tested this firsthand at security conferences. With basic equipment, you can create a convincing fake network in minutes. Most travelers connect without questioning it.

# 2. Packet Sniffing

Even on the hotel's real network, tech-savvy guests or malicious employees can use packet sniffing tools to intercept unencrypted traffic. If you're on an HTTP site (not HTTPS), they can capture:

* Login credentials
* Credit card numbers
* Email content
* Private messages

💡 **Pro Tip:** Hotels have notoriously weak network security. Their priority is guest convenience, not cybersecurity. Many still use outdated equipment from the early 2010s with known vulnerabilities that hackers actively exploit.

# 3. Data Logging for Legal Compliance

Some countries require hotels to monitor and log guest internet activity. If you're traveling internationally, your browsing history might be stored and accessible to local authorities. This isn't paranoia—it's written into many hotels' terms of service.

# Does Incognito Mode Hide Your Browsing from Hotels?

No. Incognito mode is one of the most misunderstood privacy features.

Here's what incognito mode actually does: it prevents your **browser** from storing your history locally on your device. That's it. Your browsing is still completely visible to:

* Your internet service provider (in this case, the hotel)
* Network administrators
* Websites you visit
* Anyone monitoring the WiFi network

Incognito mode doesn't encrypt your traffic. It doesn't hide your IP address. It doesn't make you anonymous. If you're on hotel WiFi in private browsing mode, the hotel sees exactly what you're doing—you've just prevented your spouse from seeing it when they borrow your laptop later.

# How to Protect Your Privacy on Hotel WiFi

Alright, enough doom and gloom. Let's talk solutions. You don't need to be a cybersecurity expert to protect yourself—you just need to follow a few proven strategies.

# Use a VPN (This Is Non-Negotiable)

A VPN (Virtual Private Network) encrypts **all** your internet traffic before it leaves your device. When you connect to hotel WiFi with a VPN active, here's what the hotel sees:

* You're connected to the network
* You're using a VPN
* The IP address of the VPN server you're connected to

That's it. They can't see which websites you visit, what you search for, or what data you transmit. The encrypted tunnel completely hides your activity.

I've tested VPNs extensively in hotels worldwide, and the difference is night and day. Without a VPN, you're browsing naked on a public network. With one, you're invisible.

🔒 **Security Note:** Not all VPNs are created equal. Free VPNs often log your activity and sell your data—defeating the entire purpose. Stick with reputable paid services that have been independently audited.

# Stick to HTTPS Sites Only

Before entering sensitive information on any website, check the address bar. If you see ""https://"" and a padlock icon, your connection to that specific site is encrypted. If you see ""http://"" (no 's'), don't enter passwords or payment details.

Most major sites use HTTPS by default now, but you'd be surprised how many hotel booking portals and local service sites still don't.

# Use Your Phone's Hotspot Instead

If you have unlimited data or a decent international plan, skip the hotel WiFi entirely. Create a mobile hotspot from your phone and connect your laptop to that. Cellular networks are significantly more secure than public WiFi, and modern 5G speeds often outperform hotel connections anyway.

I do this whenever I'm handling sensitive work or accessing financial accounts. It's not free, but peace of mind is worth the data charges.

# Avoid Sensitive Transactions Entirely

Sometimes the smartest move is just waiting. Don't check your bank account on hotel WiFi. Don't enter credit card details. Don't access confidential work documents. If it's sensitive, it can wait until you're on a secure network.

This might sound paranoid, but I've seen too many data breaches that started with someone ""just quickly checking"" their account on public WiFi.

# Best VPNs for Hotel WiFi (Based on Real Testing)

I've tested dozens of VPNs in hotels across four continents. These are the ones that consistently perform well for travel:

# 1. NordVPN – Best Overall for Travel

**Why it works:** NordVPN's NordLynx protocol is built on WireGuard, making it extremely fast even on slow hotel connections. I've used it in budget hostels with terrible WiFi and still streamed Netflix in HD without buffering.

**Travel-friendly features:**

* 10 simultaneous device connections (cover your phone, laptop, tablet, and share with travel companions)
* Obfuscated servers to bypass VPN blocks in restrictive countries
* Threat Protection blocks malware and suspicious sites automatically
* Audited no-logs policy (PwC verified it twice)

**The downside:** Monthly pricing is expensive. Get the annual plan—it drops to around $3/month, which is worth it if you travel more than once a year.

**Bottom line:** If you want one VPN for all your travel needs and don't want to think about it, this is the one I'd choose.

# 2. Surfshark – Best Budget Option

**Why it works:** Unlimited device connections and dirt-cheap pricing make this ideal for families or group travelers. The speeds are solid, though not quite as fast as NordVPN in my tests.

**What I like:**

* Camouflage Mode hides the fact you're using a VPN (useful in hotels that block them)
* CleanWeb blocks ads and trackers
* Supports 100+ countries

**The catch:** Customer support isn't as responsive as NordVPN's 24/7 live chat. If you run into issues at 2 AM in a foreign country, you might wait a bit.

# 3. ExpressVPN – Fastest Speeds, Highest Price

**Why it works:** This is the speed demon. If you're working remotely and need reliable, fast connections for video calls, ExpressVPN delivers.

**Trade-off:** It's pricey. About $8/month even with long-term plans. The performance justifies it if you're a digital nomad, but casual travelers might find better value elsewhere.

|VPN|Monthly Price|Devices|Best For|🏆|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**NordVPN**|$2.99-$12.99|10|Overall travel protection|🏆|
|**Surfshark**|$1.99-$15.45|Unlimited|Families/groups on a budget||
|**ExpressVPN**|$4.99-$12.95|10|Remote workers needing speed||

💰 **Money-Saving Tip:** All three offer 30-day money-back guarantees. Test them during your next trip and get a refund if you're not satisfied. I've done this—it's hassle-free.

# Should You Trust Hotel WiFi Networks?

Let me be blunt: no. Not without protection.

Hotel WiFi security is an afterthought. Many hotels use the same WiFi password for months (sometimes it's literally just the hotel name or ""password123""). They don't segment guest networks from administrative systems. They run outdated routers with known vulnerabilities. They prioritize ease of access over security.

This doesn't mean every hotel network is actively compromised—most aren't. But the risk is always there. It's like leaving your car unlocked in a parking lot. Maybe nothing happens. Or maybe someone walks by at the exact wrong moment.

Why take that chance when a VPN costs less than a coffee per month?

# FAQ: Hotel WiFi Privacy Questions Answered

**Can hotels see what you browse on your phone?**  
Yes, if you're connected to their WiFi. They can see which websites and apps you access, though HTTPS encryption prevents them from seeing the specific content. Using cellular data instead of WiFi keeps your activity completely private from the hotel.

**Can hotels see Netflix history?**  
Hotels can see that you connected to netflix.com and how much bandwidth you used, but they can't see which shows you watched or your account details (Netflix uses HTTPS encryption). With a VPN, they can't even tell you were on Netflix.

**Do hotels monitor WiFi for illegal activity?**  
Some do, especially regarding copyright infringement (torrenting) and excessive bandwidth usage. They're not actively watching your every move, but automated systems may flag certain activities. In countries with strict internet laws, monitoring may be mandatory.

**Will a VPN slow down my hotel WiFi?**  
Slightly, but good VPNs like NordVPN add minimal overhead—usually less than 10% speed reduction. On fast hotel networks, you won't notice. On slow ones, the slight slowdown is worth the security.

**Can hotels block VPNs?**  
Some can and do, particularly in countries like China or corporate hotels with strict IT policies. Obfuscated servers (offered by NordVPN and others) disguise VPN traffic as regular HTTPS, bypassing most blocks.

**Is it illegal to use a VPN in a hotel?**  
In most countries, no. VPNs are legal tools for privacy. However, some countries restrict VPN use (China, Russia, UAE, Iran). Check local laws before traveling, though enforcement is rare for tourists.

# Final Thoughts: Take Back Your Privacy

Here's the reality—hotels don't invest in cybersecurity because it's not their business model. They want simple, accessible WiFi that ""just works"" for guests. Security is expensive and complex, so it gets ignored.

But you're not powerless. A VPN puts the control back in your hands. For less than $3/month (the cost of a airport coffee), you can browse completely privately on any hotel WiFi network. Your banking is safe. Your work documents are protected. Your browsing history stays yours.

I travel constantly for work and leisure, and I haven't connected to a hotel network without a VPN in years. It's become as automatic as locking my hotel room door. Both are basic security measures that take seconds but prevent nightmare scenarios.

Don't overthink it. Pick one of the VPNs I recommended, install it before your next trip, and connect it before joining hotel WiFi. That's it. You're protected.

​I recently bought a Lelit Anita and I’m generally very happy with it. I’ve managed to dial in my beans and pull some decent shots, but I’ve encountered one pretty annoying issue.

​The grinder hopper (the rounded plastic part where you load the beans) seems to rotate far too easily. I first noticed it moving slightly whenever I opened the lid or cleaned the top of the machine. I’ve been careful with it, but today my fiancée struggled with the lid and accidentally rotated the hopper significantly, completely ruining the grind setting for her coffee.

​I also suspect that vibrations from the machine might be causing it to drift slightly over time.

​My question is: Has anyone found a way to ""lock"" the hopper in place so it doesn't move so easily? Are there any mods or simple fixes to add more tension to the adjustment mechanism?

​Thanks in advance for the help!

We would go for cute dates in the city, coffee, dinner, museums — it was really wholesome, and of course, I paid for everything. She didn't even say anything when it was time to pay, she just gestured with a head nod and I automatically did it; she had power and dominance over me without needing to say anything.

My friend had a specific attraction to black men and would always tell me about her roster. She knew I had been with one person, and would insist on telling me all the details of her ""encounters"", and I sat there and listened attentively like a good boy. 

One time, we ate and she met one of her dates that night at his apartment from the restaurant. She had a high sex drive and her partners were all taller, wealthier and more masculine than I. I was helpless, all I could do was take my piggy ass home to goon, fantasising that it was me.

She was also very bratty and did not allow me to look at other women, but would always comment on the men she thought were hot. After graduating, I came to terms and accepted that I am a cuck.

Whilst seeing my friend, I found this quite off-putting, but now, after accepting who I am, I realise that is the **perfect dynamic** I desire, I just had no conception of relationships beyond vanilla at time the time. 

I think she left an imprint on me: now I want nothing more than to be in a loving FLR where I am a pussy-free, locked cuck who provides for his partner. 

My friend is in another country so we lost contact after graduating. This dynamic seems quite rare: Are there even people out there who want this irl? Did my friend turn me into a cuck?

Mystic Arts Monk. We finally got a dragon ball z build y'all!:

* Pretty clear they just copy and pasted a lot of aspects, if not all of them, from the other third casters. Having said that, still better than the last few tries of magic monk.
* Mystic focus? Coffee sorcerer is back baby
* Blade Ward and True strike on a monk? WOTC showing up with a dozen roses and expensive wine for how it treated monk in the past
* level 17 feature is just copy pasted. Have seen arguments on this being changed to count spells as attacks for flurry of blows. Could also see an argument for costing focus points per cantrip per attack if you really wanna go all out

Oath of the Spellguard

* Ok so do you want to beat nerds up or be a nerd defender?
* level 3 ability is a bit redundant with defender fighting styles. Could use a range boost.
* Spell list is fine but a bit too specifically anti magic meaning outside of a couple it won't see as much use as others
* Other features are generally too specifically anti magic and wotc moved away from giving a ton of spells to monsters. Unless the DM is doing it (like me, but you can't account for that as a dm), this'll be really hit and miss on effectiveness.

Magic Stealer

* Cool idea, boring name. Spell Stealer has a bit more flourish to it.
* Empower sneak attack. Lame name, cool idea. This ability is actually potentially worth long rest recharge but maybe you get 1 back on a short rest. As a treat.
* Magical sabotage gives a wide array of uses. Situational but you'll always at least get use out of spell susceptibility
* Occult shroud is cool but will rarely come up. Needs something else with it that's punchier
* Level 3 and 13 are good actually. Good wizard support.
* Level 17. Spells are more common at this level in fights. Should be good.

Vestige Warlock

This is an archetype i've seen played a few times. I have a player with an echo knight flavored similarly. This is a fun idea.

* Add fey as an option for the companion.
* Vestige spells is actually dope as hell. You're telling me I can have a bladelock with light cleric spells? Only problem here is it doesn't future proof for new subs. Into the survey.
* Vestige recovery will see a lot of use.
* Aura of power. Name needs work but bringing a pocket god out is fun.
* Semblance of Life is good but it's missing something. Too good for short rest uses, too not good enough for short rest only. Maybe expending a spell slot recharges it?

Heating- added 3tbsp liquid egg whites, covered with napkin and microwaved 3 minutes in one 1 increments stirring between. 

Toppings- 1/2 banana, shaved dark chocolate, pepitas.

You start learning a new language thinking you’ll unlock some kind of intellectual upgrade.  
Bigger brain. New personality. Effortless cool.

What actually happens is this:

• You forget how to form sentences you’ve spoken your entire life  
• You panic ordering coffee  
• You overthink the word “the”  
• You rehearse one sentence for 20 minutes and still say it wrong  
• A child corrects you

Repeatedly.

At some point you realise language learning isn’t about sounding impressive.  
It’s about being okay with sounding stupid… in public.

And weirdly? That’s where it starts working.

You stop chasing fluency.  
You start chasing understanding.  
Culture clicks. Jokes land. Music hits differently.  
You catch a phrase in a show and feel like you just cracked a code.

That tiny moment of “wait, I understood that” does more for your brain than any textbook ever did.

Learning another language doesn’t make you smarter.  
It makes you braver.

I was going through old PUA forums, and I was reminded of the excitement of people to meet and wing each other.

Sadly most of these are retired.

To correct this, mirroring the old style, I decided to make a **free** platform for wings to connect: [https://coffeedaygame.wordpress.com/find-a-wing-daygame/](https://coffeedaygame.wordpress.com/find-a-wing-daygame/)

# Wing Rules

To aid this, here are some Wing Rules distilled over the time from the Daygame community.

* Meet for a quick coffee to get to know each other before you hit it off.
* If you have the same type for girls, take turns.
* Goal number one is vibe protection for both of you.
* If you catch IOIs for your wing, let him know. Now it is his set, even if out of turn.
* Avoid value tapping

**Notes on value tapping:**

Value Tapping is status games between Wings. This is to be avoided at nearly all costs. The only acceptable scenario is when one wing is much more experienced than the other (and hence the person getting value tapped receives mini coaching).

This is adversarial due to how serotonin works. If one person claims the leading spot, his serotonin rises -> his vibe rises. The other person experiences a serotonin crash -> his vibe crushes.

In general aim to make the relationship equal, and avoid nuances like:

* Walking half a step ahead.
* Talking more than the other.
* Humble bragging

This was my fifth visit, and the feeling was no different from the first time — except for the exciting addition of a new room type, Tucan, which is absolutely perfect for families.

It’s a large two-story wooden house with a Jacuzzi filled with mineral water — yes, you read that right, mineral water, not saltwater or anything else. The house is fully equipped with everything you could need: a PlayStation 5 with two controllers, a large TV, B&O sound system, and even Smeg appliances such as a kettle and toaster.

This was the first time I felt completely entertained without even going down to the river. The mineral pool, mountain views, lush greenery, and even toucan birds were more than enough. Around the house, peacocks freely wander about and sometimes even fly into the house to say hi. They’re not afraid of people — just don’t startle them.

Breakfast here is already known to be the best. The spread includes a full set of Thai desserts, grilled pork with sticky rice, pan-fried eggs, deep-fried dough sticks (pa thong ko), a generous salad bar, and rice porridge. If you’re still hungry, you can always ask for more.

The weather during this season is wonderful — cool and comfortable. If you love peace and quiet, this place comes highly recommended. It’s only about a 2.5-hour drive from Bangkok.

Safety is not a concern, as the resort clearly separates overnight guests from café visitors. There is a gated entrance with staff assisting access, so you don’t need to worry about strangers entering the property.

The resort also has a café at the front. Coffee lovers will be delighted with many choices of light and medium roasts. The desserts are all delicious. Whenever you visit Kaeng Krachan, even if you’re not staying overnight, you should definitely stop by and try the Toffee Nut and Crème Brûlée — if they’re not good, feel free to come back and comment!",0,1768568214.0,ThailandTourism,5,0.36,False
1qef8dt,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachE/comments/1qef8dt/short_window_departure_time_preconditioning/,Short Window Departure Time / Preconditioning Question,"I have our normal departure time set for 8 am with the medium climate setting, and it works great. We plug in overnight to our L2 charger and it's charged and ready to go in the morning. When it's cold (i.e. below freezing) I'll check the app while drinking my morning coffee and typically see that it's preparing cabin and the battery. However, if for some reason I need to push up the departure time to earlier and end up shortening the window, it will just prepare the cabin. 

For example, suppose it's 18F overnight, I need to leave at 7:30 am instead of 8, but forgot to change the departure time the night before. If I check the app at 7:15 in the morning, it may not have started the preconditioning yet. If I update the departure time to 7:30, it will just prepare the cabin. If I push the departure time out a bit, say to 7:45, it will say it's preconditioning the battery for a few minutes, then switch to just preparing the cabin. If I set the climate setting to off, it just says charge complete. 

I guess my question is whether it's just prioritizing the cabin preparation and/or if it just skips the battery preconditioning if it doesn't have time to fully precondition the battery. My understanding is that if it's below freezing and plugged in, it will keep the battery from getting below freezing, but that's way below the temp it gets the battery up to when preconditioning.",4,1768568187.0,MachE,6,0.84,False

The bread tasted very raw and stale, The filling didn't help either. Overall it just didn't feel fresh or worth the price.

1qef1xi,https://www.reddit.com/r/MindsetConqueror/comments/1qef1xi/how_to_become_a_romantic_man_that_women_actually/,How to Become a ROMANTIC Man That Women Actually Want: The Psychology Behind Real Romance,"Let me guess. You've probably tried the whole ""surprise flowers"" thing once or twice, maybe sent a sweet text here and there, but deep down you feel like you're just... winging it? Like, there's this whole romantic language you never quite learned, and now you're watching other guys effortlessly sweep women off their feet while you're stuck googling ""romantic gestures"" at 2am.

Here's what nobody tells you: Romance isn't about grand gestures or copying some movie scene. It's a skill you can actually learn. I've spent months digging into relationship psychology, reading everything from attachment theory research to interviews with therapists, and yeah, talking to a lot of women about what actually makes them feel seen and desired. Turns out, most guys are getting this wrong in the exact same ways.

The real kicker? Society never taught us this shit. We got action movies and sports, but no one sat us down and explained how emotional attunement works or why thoughtfulness hits differently than expensive gifts. But here's the good news: once you understand the mechanics behind what makes someone feel romanced, it becomes way easier.

  
 **1. Stop Performing Romance, Start Paying Attention**

Most guys think romance is about doing big things. Nope. Romance is about noticing small things. Women feel most romanced when they realize you've been paying attention to details they didn't even know they shared.

She mentioned she loves rainy mornings three months ago? Text her a cozy playlist when it rains. She gets stressed on Tuesdays because of work meetings? Leave her favorite snack somewhere she'll find it on Tuesday morning.

This is backed by research in relationship psychology. Dr. John Gottman's work shows that successful relationships are built on ""bids for connection,"" those tiny moments where someone shares something, and you actually respond. Romance isn't the gesture itself; it's proving ""I see you, I remember you, you matter to me.""

Start keeping mental notes. Not in a creepy spreadsheet way, but genuinely listen when she talks. Women notice when you remember.

  
 **2. Master the Art of Anticipation**

Real romance creates anticipation. Not mystery or playing games, but building genuine excitement through thoughtfulness.

Here's how: Don't just plan a date. Tease it. ""I found this place, I think you're going to lose your mind over. Friday at 7?"" Now she's curious all week. The anticipation becomes part of the experience.

Or try this: Send her something that arrives before you do. Not flowers (although flowers are fine), but something that shows you know her taste. A book by that author, she casually mentioned. That specific tea she orders. The anticipation of ""he's thinking about me even when we're apart"" hits different.

The app [Ash](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ash-ai-for-mental-health/id6474862947) is actually pretty solid for this. It's like having a relationship coach in your pocket that helps you understand communication patterns and timing. Way better than just shooting random romantic texts into the void.

  
 **3. Get Physical (**But Not How You Think)

Non-sexual physical affection is insanely underrated. Research from the Touch Research Institute shows that physical touch releases oxytocin, the bonding hormone. But most guys only get physical when they want sex, and women can smell that agenda from a mile away.

Random acts of physical affection:

\* Grab her hand when you're walking, not because you have to, but because you want to.

\* Play with her hair while you're watching TV.

\* Kiss her forehead randomly.

\* Pull her in for a hug from behind while she's cooking.

\* Rest your hand on her lower back when you're in public.

These micro-touches throughout the day create way more romantic tension than one big gesture. It's the difference between ""he wants something from me"" and ""he can't help but touch me because he's drawn to me.""

  
 **4. Create Rituals That Are Just Yours**

Shared rituals build intimacy like nothing else. Esther Perel talks about this in her relationship work. These don't have to be elaborate. Could be:

\* Sunday morning coffee in bed together (no phones).

\* A specific song that's ""your song"" that you play randomly.

\* A weekly walk where you both share one thing that happened that week.

\* Cooking a specific meal together every month.

The key is consistency. Romance isn't just spontaneity. It's also showing up reliably in small ways that say ""this matters to me.""

  
**5. Write It Down** (Yes, Really)

Texting is easy. Handwritten notes hit different. There's actual psychology behind this; the physical act of writing something by hand creates more emotional weight for both writer and receiver.

You don't need to be Shakespeare. Just genuine:

\* ""Thought about you when I saw this today"" with a photo of something she'd appreciate.

\* A sticky note on the bathroom mirror before she wakes up.

\* A short letter explaining specifically what you love about her (not generic stuff, specific observations).

The book ""[The 5 Love Languages](https://a.co/d/3LStshA)"" by Gary Chapman is clutch here. This thing has sold over 20 million copies and won multiple awards because it breaks down exactly how different people receive love. Some people need words, others need actions, and some need touch. Figure out her language and speak it. Insanely good read that'll make you question everything you thought you knew about showing affection. Chapman is a relationship counselor with decades of research, and this book basically gives you the cheat codes.

  
 **6. Plan Experiences, Not Just Dates**

Dinner is fine. Dinner is safe. But romance lives in experiences that create stories.

Psychologist Dr. Leaf Van Boven's research shows that experiential purchases create more lasting happiness than material ones. Translation: memories beat things every time.

Ideas:

\* Surprise picnic at sunset (basic but effective if you put thought into her favorite foods).

\* Take a random day trip somewhere neither of you has been.

\* Book a couple's cooking class or pottery class (yeah, like Ghost, whatever, it works).

\* Create a scavenger hunt that ends somewhere meaningful to your relationship.

The trick is specificity to her interests. Don't take her rock climbing if she hates heights just because you think it's romantic. Romance is about her, not your Pinterest board idea of romance.

  
 **7. Become a Student of Her Inner World**

This is the big one. The difference between guys women find romantic and guys they don't? Romantic guys are deeply curious about their partner's inner world.

Ask deeper questions:

\* ""What made you feel most alive this week?""

\* ""If you could change one thing about your day, what would it be?""

\* ""What's something you've been thinking about lately?""

Then actually listen. Don't fix, don't offer solutions, just hold space. The podcast The Art of Charm has incredible episodes about active listening and emotional intelligence. These skills make you not just romantic, but magnetic.

There's also an AI learning platform called [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) that pulls from relationship psychology research, therapy insights, and expert interviews to create personalized audio content. 

If you're trying to level up your romantic skills specifically, you can ask it to build a learning plan around ""becoming more romantically intelligent as an introvert"" or ""understanding female psychology in dating,"" and it creates structured episodes from books like Mating in Captivity, research on attachment theory, and real relationship expert talks. You control the depth, from quick 15-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with examples and context. 

The voice options are surprisingly addictive too. There's this smooth, conversational style that makes absorbing relationship psychology way less dry than reading academic papers. Worth checking out if you're serious about understanding the mechanics behind what actually makes women feel romanced.

""[Mating in Captivity](https://a.co/d/hA5jhW8)"" by Esther Perel will blow your mind. She's one of the world's leading relationship therapists, and this bestseller explores how to keep desire alive in long-term relationships. It's sexy, it's smart, and it completely reframes how you think about romance and attraction. Best relationship book I've ever read, hands down.

  
**8. Be Spontaneous with Intention**

Sounds contradictory, right? But hear me out. True spontaneity within a relationship means breaking patterns in thoughtful ways.

\* She expects you home at 6? Show up at 4 with her favorite takeout and a ""let's go somewhere"" attitude.

\* Book a hotel room in your own city for one night just to change the scenery.

\* Randomly declare a ""no plans"" day where you both just exist together without agendas.

The app [Finch](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/finch-self-care-pet/id1528595748) is actually helpful here for building better habits around thoughtfulness. It's a self-care app that helps you track patterns and set reminders to do the small things that matter. Sounds corny, but consistency is what separates romantic guys from guys who have one good idea every six months.

  
 **9. Make Her Laugh** (Then Make Her Feel Safe)

Humor and security are the ultimate romantic combo. Women are drawn to guys who can make them laugh, but romance happens when they feel safe enough to be vulnerable.

This means:

\* Don't use humor to deflect serious conversations.

\* Be playful, but know when to shift to genuine.

\* Never make her the butt of the joke in ways that make her insecure.

\* Show up when shit gets real. Romance isn't just the fun times.

Dr. Sue Johnson's work on Emotionally Focused Therapy shows that the deepest romantic bonds come from being a ""secure base"" for your partner. You can be fun and light, but also solid and dependable.

  
 **10. Understand That Romance is a Practice, Not a Personality**

Here's the truth bomb: You're not ""just not a romantic guy."" That's a cop-out. Romance is a skill set, and like any skill, you get better with practice.

Start small. Pick three things from this list and do them this week. Notice what lands. Pay attention to her reactions. Adjust. Romance isn't one-size-fits-all. What makes one woman swoon might make another cringe. Your job is to learn her specific language.

Check out the YouTube channel [Charisma on Command](https://www.youtube.com/user/charismaoncommand). They break down social dynamics and relationship behavior in ways that make you better at reading people and situations. Their videos on romantic communication are goldmines.

Bottom line? Romance isn't about being someone you're not. It's about being more intentional with who you already are. It's showing up consistently, paying attention relentlessly, and giving a damn about the small details that make her feel seen.

Stop overthinking the big gestures. Master the small moments. That's where real romance lives.

# Discover Your Best Buy Coffee Beans: The Intelligentsia Difference

Every morning ritual deserves the promise of an exceptional cup. That first aromatic wave, the rich, nuanced taste, the way it sets the tone for your day – it’s a moment you invest in. When you’re searching for the 'best buy coffee beans,' you’re not just looking for a bag of coffee; you’re seeking that consistent, peak experience, and true value that goes beyond the price tag.

At Intelligentsia, we understand that pursuit. For over two decades, we’ve pioneered Direct Trade, forging deep, years-long relationships with farmers globally. This isn't just about ethical sourcing; it's about partnering with growers who consistently produce elite-grade beans, paying them significantly above Fair Trade prices for their unparalleled quality. What truly defines a 'best buy' isn't merely the cost, but the inherent quality, traceable origin, and the meticulous care taken at every step. We don't just source; we curate. And critically, your coffee is roasted-to-order, never sitting on a shelf. It’s roasted specifically for you, then immediately shipped, ensuring you experience the beans at their absolute peak freshness.

*   **Unrivaled Freshness:** The 'best' coffee is fresh coffee. Our roast-to-order commitment means you receive beans mere days off the roast, delivering vibrant aromatics and complex flavors that pre-roasted options simply can't match.
*   **Ethical Excellence, Superior Taste:** Our Direct Trade model guarantees not only fair and sustainable practices for our farming partners but also access to extraordinary Direct Trade Single Origin beans, showcasing distinct regional characteristics—like the bright acidity of an Ethiopian Yirgacheffe or the syrupy body of a Guatemalan Huehuetenango.
*   **Consistent Quality & Flavor Clarity:** Whether you prefer the legendary, versatile notes of our Black Cat Espresso or the unique journey of our Seasonal Direct Trade Single Origins, you can trust Intelligentsia to deliver a consistent, delicious cup, highlighting the inherent qualities of each bean.

Ready to redefine your definition of the best buy? Explore our curated collection of Direct Trade Single Origin coffees, or elevate your daily routine with an Intelligentsia Subscription, offering Roaster’s Choice, Seasonal, or Espresso options with always free shipping.

1qef0i9,https://www.reddit.com/r/sims2/comments/1qef0i9/the_broke_family_is_freaking_hard_to_play_bro/,"The Broke Family is freaking hard to play, bro!","I just booted up the Broke family to test out some mods and get some gameplay in for my annual three-week spell of playing TS2. How on Earth did I manage this family when I was a kid?

Brandi's critical needs are always low. I had to restart twice to figure out how to get her out of a tired/hungry loop. I tried having Brandi make friends with Darren Dreamer because in my gameplay, I want them to get married and move into his house. But they interact for two hours tops before she wants to go back to bed! Napping on the couch doesn't lift up her energy, it just stops it from lowering. When she's hungry, she doesn't make food, she just stuffs her face in the fridge.

Dustin will not do his homework, or he gets 80% done and quits to go do something else and fights my attempts to get him to go back to it. None of his needs are even all that low - he's not bedtime tired or ravenous, he's not critically low on fun, he just *doesn't want to do his homework*. There was a point where Dustin AND Beau (after growing up into a kid) both respectively had 2 homework packets just sitting on the floor partially finished - not from a lack of me trying to force them to get it done. Dustin lost his job and became ""one of the worst students in school"", and Beau was doing so bad he was at risk of being taken away by CPS, according to two blurbs I got. The whole family regularly goes to bed between 12AM and 3AM because that's just when everything finally settles down for two seconds!

Worst part was, once I finally got on a somewhat workable gameplay loop, everyone got sick with the flu and Brandi couldn't rest up enough, so she just freaking *died* randomly in the middle of the night! 😭 So I am on my third quit without saving.

Then there's just the little quality-of-life things. I queue up actions and they get cancelled because the Sim can't do it that exact split second. Bed management is difficult even with the Smart Beds mod on. Pink soup crashed one of my play sessions - I knew something was wrong when the pizza slices turned flashing pink, and then it just spiraled from there.

What even is this game? I do *not* remember it being this hard. I remember running a coffee shop bookstore hybrid business to max level back when I was 9! Now I am 28 and the Broke family has left me turning off my computer with my head in my hands. 🤣",26,1768567564.0,sims2,13,0.96,False

I'm from Delhi and heading to Mumbai for lolla(midnight flight on 24th). I had 2 General GA passes(both days) but my friend had to cancel, so now going solo.

I was wondering 
1. Is there any pre-lolla meetups happening in Delhi/NCR before the fest?
2. Or in Mumbai on 24th morning before heading out to the venue?

Would honestly love to meet people , hang out or maybe grab breakfast/coffee and then head to lolla together.

Also if anyone is still looking to join for Lolla , I've got an extra GA pass for both days and would prefer going w someone rather than alone.

Are there any specific probiotics that help motility in the large intestine? Or anything else yall recommend like peppermint or decaf coffee? 

The problem is with the Motility Activator it has ginger extract and artichoke extract combination but I know that mainly works on the small intestines. While the IMO and methane is affecting the large intestines as well so the mmc will be impaired there as well.

My husband a has raging undiagnosed ADHD, needs reminders for everything, is consistently forgetting things/ causing chaos for example, running out of petrol on a busy road etc, and does about 10% of total household labour. 

We have been to therapy for years to try to work on the issues this causes in our relationship, but a few months ago I was looking through his phone and saw screenshots of him looking up erotic massage places in our city.

I confronted him and he told me he never went and wouldn’t do that. But, that was the moment that everything changed for me and I stopped caring about our relationship. I decided that I no longer wanted to put myself out for this person, or give any more than I already have over the course of our 7 years together.

I’ve told my husband several times that I don’t like him and that I want a divorce. I will look him dead in the eye and say I want a divorce I want to be on my own. He’ll throw a temper tantrum, tell me to go back to my ex boyfriend, and slam doors before coming back five minutes later like nothings happened telling me he’ll make a coffee for me in be morning ‘darling.’ 

I don’t want to be with him anymore and feel relieved when I think about living in apartment on my own and not surrounded by the chaos, but he doesn’t take it seriously. 

I’ve asked him how I can show him that I don’t want to be married to him and he just answers with ‘I think you do, I want to show you I can be the husband you need.’

The thing is that he’s had so many opportunities to 

‘Show me’ and it’s all talk. He genuinely believes that he can improve and take on 50% of the housework etc but everything he’s shown me proves otherwise. 

I really don’t know what to do. 

I tell him I want a divorce.

He throws a tantrum.

Comes back five mins later and acts normal.

I can’t be bothered to deal with the tantrum again so I just switch off and go to sleep.

He begs me to do something with him the next day, if I say no I don’t like you, he’ll throw another tantrum.

My thoughts are now just to move out while he’s at work so I don’t have temper tantrums around or the risk of someone throwing my things in the bin which he’s done before, and just rent and move into my own space. But that feels cruel. 

What would be the best way to go about making him understand that I want a divorce?

1qeesg7,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Lost-Breadfruit9932/comments/1qeesg7/should_i_take_vitamin_d/,Should I Take Vitamin D?,"Let's be real: vitamin D deficiency is everywhere. A lot of people think it's no big deal—they drink fortified milk, so they're covered, right? Not really. Most natural foods don't have enough vitamin D to make a difference, and even fortified foods often fall short of what your body actually needs.

Here's the thing: vitamin D isn't just a vitamin—it's a hormone. And your main source isn’t food; it's sunlight. But with everyone being told to avoid the sun and slather on sunscreen, it's no wonder low vitamin D has become a silent epidemic.

reference: [Vitamin D: Hype or Hope?](https://www.stanfordchem.com/vitamin-d-hype-or-hope.html)

**How to Tell If You Might Be Low**  
The only surefire way to know is a blood test. But your body drops hints. If any of these sound familiar, it might be time to get checked—and aim to get your levels up to that sweet spot between 60 and 80 ng/mL.

1. **Aches and pains that won’t quit** — Especially in your bones and muscles. Dr. Michael Holick, a top vitamin D researcher, points out that many people showing up with unexplained pain and tiredness end up getting mislabeled with fibromyalgia or chronic fatigue syndrome.
2. **You’re always sick** — Vitamin D helps your immune system fight off germs. If you’re catching every cold or flu going around, it could be a sign your levels are too low.
3. **Your mood and mind feel off** — We’re talking low mood, brain fog, trouble focusing, or even headaches. One study of older adults found that those really low in vitamin D were **11 times** more likely to struggle with depression. Low levels have also been linked to fuzzy thinking, forgetfulness, and migraines.
4. **You’re tired all the time** — Not just “need more coffee” tired, but deep, dragging fatigue. Research consistently ties low vitamin D to low energy. In one case, a woman with severe fatigue, back pain, and daily headaches had a vitamin D level of just 6 ng/mL.
5. **Your head sweats a lot** — Sounds random, but it’s a classic clue. Doctors even ask new moms if their babies have sweaty heads—it’s a common early sign of deficiency, thanks to how vitamin D affects your nerves and muscles.",1,1768566889.0,u_Lost-Breadfruit9932,0,1.0,False

1qeerou,https://www.reddit.com/r/OALangBaAko/comments/1qeerou/oa_lang_ba_ako_for_reacting_this_way_i_feel/,OA lang ba ako? for reacting this way? I feel harassed.,"Bakit ganon, I am somehow pissed at myself for not speaking up at the moment it happened. 

I agreed to see a long acquaintance/friend of mine. Long - as in maybe 10 years ago ko pa siya kilala and we’ve done projects/work together naman years after graduating college. Di kmi besties ah. Friend friend lang.

So nag coffee kami, we sat opposite each other first, but he stood up after and sat beside me. 

First it was okay, pero onti onti na sya nagiging touchy? Poking my sides, grabbing my shoulder, grabbing my LEGs? His hand above my knee, then umangat? on mg leg again pero between nung thigh and leg?? i dont know what you call that part. Pero LEG pa din yun. I’m wearing pants, btw. Then later on, squishing my arms. Then APIR daw, then grabbed naman my hands. Sa coffeeshop yan ha, what more if sumama pako sa car nya or agreed to watch a movie with him?! 😩

I was uncomfortable na. And everytime sya ganyan, sina slide off or tinatanggal ko naman. 

But what shocked me was he tried to grab something from the other side of my table. So yung kamay/braso nya - nasagi talaga sa joga ko. So alam mo yun, magugulat ka na lang, STUNNED. At that time, kaya ko pa handle. I didn’t want to be rude. Dumidistansya ko. But he keeps coming closer, as if I’m being cornered at my seat. 

Then ok, time to separate ways naman na, akbay akbay pa din talaga sya. Holding my waist with both of his hands! From behind sya ah. TINATANGGAL KO TALAGA! But, bat ganon, hindi ako makapag salita. Di ba sya aware panay tanggal ako? Huhu. If I wanted to naman, I would reciprocate by holding his hand, BUT I DID NOT. Kase ayaw ko. 😭


Nakakapang lambot ngayon. I Feel disgusted na. Harassed. It’s just sad. I wish I could’ve done more or said something, now I’m here… ang bigat kase sa sarili. 😖

We sit next to each other, get coffee together, vent about work. She’s more outgoing than I am. I’m quieter, especially in meetings.

Last week we had a project meeting with our manager and a few other teams. Nothing high-stakes, just updates and timelines. I had worked on a section of the project, so I knew I’d probably be asked something.

When my manager looked at me and said, “Any thoughts on the rollout?” I paused. Not because I didn’t have thoughts, but because I was trying to put them together. There was that brief silence where everyone stares at you.

Before I could say anything, Jenna jumped in.

“She thinks we should wait a week,” she said. “Right?”

I looked at her. I hadn’t said that yet. I opened my mouth, closed it, then nodded because, honestly, it was close enough and I didn’t want to make it weird.

It happened again later. “She’s good with the timeline,” Jenna said when someone asked me directly. I wasn’t fully good with it, but I shrugged. I could feel myself getting annoyed, but I also felt silly for being annoyed since I wasn’t speaking up fast enough.

After the meeting, we walked back to our desks. I hesitated. I almost let it go. Then I said, probably sharper than I meant to, “Hey, can you not answer for me in meetings?”

She stopped and looked surprised. “I was helping,” she said.

“I know,” I said. “But it feels weird when you speak for me.”

There was a long pause. People were typing around us. Someone laughed down the row. Jenna crossed her arms and said, “Well, you weren’t answering.”

That stung, because it was true. I said, “I just need a second sometimes. I can talk.”

She didn’t say anything else, just nodded and went back to her desk. We didn’t talk much the rest of the day.

Since then, she’s been noticeably quieter with me. In the next meeting, when I paused, no one jumped in. The silence stretched, and my face got hot before I finally spoke. Part of me wished she had helped. Another part of me was relieved she didn’t.

I keep wondering if I should have handled it differently, or privately later, or not at all. I didn’t mean to embarrass her, but I also didn’t like feeling invisible.

💔💔""Boss, the woman's awake!"" a man's voice suddenly shouted.

Hazel opened her eyes and found herself standing at the edge of a cliff. Two men ere gripping her arms, keeping her from moving. Below her roared the sea--wild, foaming waves crashing against the rocks. If these men let go, she would fall, and there'd be nothing left of her but broken bones and saltwater.

She gasped for air, fighting the panic rising in her chest. Her face was swollen, blood trickling down from her temple, streaking across her cheek. She didn't even know why these thugs had kidnapped her.

She couldn't remember offending anyone. All she'd done was stop for coffee before work. Then, as she turned the corner, a group of huge men grabbed her. She hadn't even managed to scream before everything went black.

Did her husband know she'd been taken? She had no way of finding out.

She tried to speak. ""Who are you? Why are you doing this to me?"" Her throat burned with pain, her voice cracking.

""Dead people don't need to know that much,"" said the scar-faced man they'd called ""Boss.""

The men holding her loosened their grip slightly, just enough for her body to sway dangerously near the cliff. Hazel screamed. ""Wait! I have money! If that's what you want--whoever sent you, I'll pay ten times more!""

The scarred man glanced at his companions, and they tugged her back an inch from the edge. ""And what makes you think I need your money?""

Hazel forced herself to stay calm, her mind spinning fast. ""If you really wanted to kill me,"" she said, voice trembling but steady, ""you wouldn't have waited for me to wake up. But you did.""

For a second, surprise flickered across his face. Hazel exhaled quietly. She pressed on. ""So what do you want from me?""

The scarred man's lips curled into a grin. He stepped closer, placing a rough hand against her cheek. ""You're pretty. And smart,"" he said, his breath hot against her skin. Hazel's stomach twisted--she felt like throwing up. She clenched her lips shut.

""The person who paid us told us not to kill you,"" he said finally. ""She just wants to confirm something.""

She. Hazel caught the pronoun immediately. Not he. She. Her mind sharpened.

There was only one woman in the world who hated her that much--her husband's stalker, Olivia Howard. A complete lunatic.

""Is it Olivia Howard?"" Hazel asked.

His eyebrows lifted again. Hazel took a silent, shaky breath of relief. She was right. If it was Olivia, she might still make it out alive. Olivia probably just wanted to humiliate her--make her see that her husband, Rayan, didn't love her. If Hazel agreed to divorce him, she'd be fine.

Technically, Hazel understood Olivia's obsession. After all, her husband was every woman's fantasy--tall, sinfully handsome, like something carved from marble in an Italian museum. And those blue eyes...when he looked at you, you couldn't help but surrender.

But Olivia wasn't that lucky. She didn't have the face of Rayan Knight's lover. Even though she was the sister of Evelyn--Rayan's dead lover--she didn't look like her.

And that made her jealous.

Still, Hazel hadn't thought Olivia would go this far.

Wasn't she afraid of being arrested? The woman was out of her mind.

Hazel didn't wait for Scarface to speak again. ""So what does Olivia want me to do?""

""Call your husband,"" he said. ""If he's willing to pay the ransom, you walk free. If he's not...you go over the edge."" He smirked. ""Sweetheart, don't hate me. It's your husband who gets to decide.""

""I heard you,"" Hazel muttered, stepping back slightly, revolted by his endearment.

""Good. I'm curious to see what kind of man would abandon a woman as beautiful and clever as you.""

He shoved a phone into her hand. ""Hurry up. I'm not a patient guy."" Hazel took a deep breath and dialed the number she knew by heart. Her hands shook. No one outside knew what her marriage was truly like. Rayan had never treated her like a wife. In public, he played the perfect husband--smiling for cameras, taking her to expensive restaurants, buying diamonds, handbags, and designer gowns.

But Hazel knew--those were the things Evelyn had loved, not her.

At home, she was nothing more than the gum stuck under his shoe--disgusting, unwanted.

Still, she hadn't fought back. She was the Knight family's adopted daughter. She had no say in her life. When Rayan chose her, she could only nod. And yes--she loved

him. Loving Rayan was written into every woman's DNA.

But now she knew what truly mattered--her life. Nothing, no one, was worth dying for. Especially not him. She had promises to keep, people to meet again.

The call connected. But it wasn't Rayan's voice--it was a woman's.

""Hazel? I'm not surprised you'd call. How are you?"" Olivia's voice was sweet and sickly, like poison coated in sugar.

Hazel swallowed, forcing herself not to break. Olivia's plan was airtight. She was with Rayan. Right now.

What were they doing together?

""Olivia, cut the crap. Put Rayan on the phone. You'll get what you want--I mean the divorce,"" Hazel said sharply.

Olivia laughed, soft and cruel. ""Of course. But right now, he's standing at my sister's grave, paying his respects. He's saying he can't live without her. Oh, Rayan, how pathetic. Always the substitute.""

""Yes,"" Hazel said with a brittle smile. ""But compared to you, I'm still better off. At least I share a bed with him. You can only jerk off to his picture in secret--""

""Enough!"" Olivia screamed. ""Soon you'll be thrown out of the Knight family, and I'll be the only woman at Rayan's side!""

Scarface shot Hazel a look, silently urging her to get on with it. Hazel steadied her breathing. ""Then tell me, Olivia,"" she said coldly, ""why not just convince him to divorce me yourself? If he loves you that much.""

""Don't play innocent!"" Olivia shrieked. ""He married you because you look like my sister! You were a replacement, a pathetic crutch to stop him from breaking down!""

""Then why kidnap me? You could've told me directly--I'd have agreed to the divorce,"" Hazel snapped.

""Oh, I know you would,"" Olivia hissed. ""I know he doesn't care about you. But you still shamelessly agreed to be his wife. You need to pay for that. I want you to suffer. And I want you to hear from his own mouth how little you matter to him!""

Hazel clenched her fists. She heard footsteps--Rayan's. She knew that stride anywhere.

""Who is it, Olivia?"" His deep voice rumbled through the phone.

Olivia covered the receiver, whispering, ""It's Hazel. She insists on talking to you. I told her what day it was, but she didn't care. She says she's your wife.""

Hazel held her breath.

Rayan frowned, took the phone, and his voice came cold and precise. ""Hello.""

Hazel inhaled shakily. ""Rayan, I'm in danger. I need your--""

He cut her off. ""Hazel Foster, I thought I made your position in my life very clear from the start. Know your place. Don't test my patience with your pointless dramatics."" The line went dead.

The cold, repetitive beep sliced through her like a knife. Hazel's heart shattered. He despised her even more than she'd imagined.

The scarred man smirked. ""Looks like your so-called husband doesn't want you anymore. But don't worry, sweetheart. I'll make sure you don't miss him tonight.""

He lunged at her.

Hazel reacted instantly--she bit the man beside her, hard. He howled, and she shoved him back with all her strength, then leapt--straight off the cliff.

Because Hazel believed one thing: she wouldn't die that easily.

...

When Hazel woke again, it was already the next morning.

She slowly opened her eyes. A faint beeping sound from a nearby machine filled the silence, and the sharp, sterile scent of disinfectant told her she was in a hospital.

She tried to sit up, but pain exploded through her body--sharp, tearing pain, as if every bone had been shattered and stitched back together wrong. She let out a low groan and sank weakly against the pillow. Just then, a nurse came in.

""Mrs. Knight, you're awake?"" The nurse's voice softened, relief flickering across her face.

""Why...why am I in a hospital?"" Hazel's throat felt like sandpaper.

While carefully removing the needle from Hazel's hand, the nurse nodded. ""The beach rescue team found you last night. They said you were floating about two hundred meters offshore. You were lucky--they got to you just in time."" She hesitated, sighed, then added, ""We identified you through your blood type and ID.

Mr. Knight--your husband--has already covered all the expenses. He told us to make sure you received the best care.""

The nurse left.

Hazel stared blankly for a moment, her fingers curling tight around the blanket. So Rayan did know she'd been hurt. But he hadn't come. Not even once. Just a phone call, some money, and that was it. Did he even know what kind of terror she'd lived through?

Her phone suddenly buzzed on the bedside table. Hazel reached for it, unlocked the screen--and froze.

Olivia had posted a new photo on Instagram.

In the picture, Rayan was carrying her upstairs in his arms--like a scene from some romantic movie. You couldn't see his face, only his back, but Hazel knew that silhouette anywhere. After three years of marriage, she could recognize him by the way his shoulders moved. That was her husband. The man she'd once believed was hers.

The caption read:

""Twisted my ankle, and someone insisted on carrying me.""

Below, the comments flooded in:

""So sweet!""

""Couple goals!""

""Perfect together!""

Hazel's hands trembled. Tears stung her eyes. While she'd been fighting for her life, her husband had been playing lover to another woman.

She wiped her tears away quickly. He wasn't worth it. Not a single drop.

Without hesitation, she called her friend. She didn't explain much--just asked her to prepare divorce papers. Her friend sounded shocked, but Hazel told her she'd explain everything tomorrow and hung up the phone.

...

At evening, Hazel was lying on the hospital bed when the door of the ward opened.

Rayan's assistant, Simon, walked in carrying a fruit basket. ""Madam, how are you feeling.""

He set it on the table, his tone polite, professional. ""The doctor says your injuries are serious. You'll need a few days of rest before you're discharged.""

Hazel turned her gaze away from him, her voice weak but steady. ""Where's Rayan?""

Simon's smile faltered for a second, then he recovered. ""The president knows you're awake."" A brief pause. ""But he said your decision to swim in a restricted area was highly irresponsible. He...said he doesn't have the patience for your games anymore.""

The air in the room froze. Hazel's chest tightened; the pain flared up again.

Simon quickly added, ""Please don't take it to heart, madam. The president has been very busy, but he still cares about your condition. He asked me to check that you were safe.""

Hazel nodded lightly, her tone almost detached. ""I understand. Thank you.""

Simon hesitated, wanting to say more--but her expression stopped him. Then Hazel spoke again, her voice calm and faint. She handed him a sealed envelope.

""Give this to Rayan.""

Simon blinked. ""What is it?""

""He'll know when he opens it."" Hazel closed her eyes, ending the conversation.

Simon looked uneasy, but he nodded and quietly left the room.

\*\*\*

RK Empire Headquarters -- President's Office

Rayan glared at the divorce papers on his desk, his knuckles white. A second later, he slammed them onto the floor.

""How dare she?"" His voice was low and dangerous, vibrating like thunder trapped in his chest.

He had just spent a fortune cleaning up that so-called ""accident."" The police report had stated: 'Mrs. Knight illegally entered a restricted area, violating safety regulations.' The prosecutor's office had even considered filing charges.

He'd paid, negotiated, and canceled a billion-dollar overseas contract to bury the scandal--

And now she'd sent him divorce papers?

His chest tightened, fury and humiliation burning together.

He reached for his phone--then saw it. Her number had been blocked.

Something inside him snapped.

""Fine, Hazel,"" he muttered, voice like a growl. He kicked his chair over and hurled the phone against the wall, shattering it.

The papers still lay on the floor--crisp, white, official. All it would take was his signature, and three years of marriage would be over.

Rayan Knight.

A man powerful enough to silence entire boards, to make corporate giants kneel--was now standing here, slapped in the face by his own wife. The woman he'd pulled from obscurity into the Knight family's world had been the first to say ""enough.""

The door opened. Simon stepped in carefully, carrying a cup of coffee. ""Sir, your coffee.""

Rayan didn't look at him. ""She wants a divorce,"" he said, his tone glacial.

Simon froze. ""Madam...she--?""

""I've read the police report,"" Rayan cut in. ""That beach is restricted. She went there on her own. I cleaned up the mess for her, and now she blames me?""

""Sir, maybe Mrs. Foster was--""

""What? Kidnapped by a wave?"" Rayan's laugh was sharp, cruel. ""Olivia said she drove there alone. With sunscreen and a swimsuit. That's her 'kidnapping story'?""

Simon fell silent.

""She wants to play victim,"" Rayan said coldly, ""then let her. I'll play along.""

He took a long sip of coffee, his eyes darkening. ""She thinks divorce will scare me. That I'll come running after her.""

""Will you, sir?"" Simon asked carefully.

""In her dreams."" His voice dropped to a lethal calm. ""She needs to learn where she stands.""

Did Hazel really think she could survive without him? She had no skills, no experience--she'd be lost within a week. The thought only fueled his anger.

""Freeze all her credit cards,"" he ordered. ""Let's see how long she can keep pretending.""

Simon's throat tightened, but he nodded and left.

\*\*\*

That night, when Hazel walked out from the bathroom, a message popped up on her phone.

Notification: Your credit card ending in \*\*\*\* has been frozen.

She stared at the screen and let out a bitter laugh. Of course. Rayan always moved fast. But if he thought she couldn't survive without him, he was wrong.

He never really knew her at all.

Fine. If he was so eager to cut her off, she'd make it easy for him.

She blocked his number, put her phone aside on the table, and lay on the bed, ready to have a goodnight sleep. 

Tomorrow is a big day and she need a lot of energy.

1qeen0e,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1qeen0e/stability_declining/,Stability: Declining,"The receptionist smiles at me the same way every time.

Not warm. Not cold. Just correct.

“Take a seat,” she says. “They’ll call you.”

I do.

The chairs are identical. The room smells like old coffee and something medicinal. A screen on the wall cycles through names in soft blue text.

Mara L.

Jonas P.

Ruth K.

Each name lights up. Each person stands. Each person walks through the door on the left.

None of them come back.

I check the paper in my hand. No number. Just my name, smudged like it was written in a hurry.

The screen ticks forward.

I raise my hand. The receptionist looks at me like she’s just noticed furniture speaking.

“Yes?”

“My name hasn’t come up.”

She types something. Frowns. Types again.

“Hm,” she says. “It’s not your turn yet.”

“But—”

“They’ll call you.”

I sit back down.

Time here doesn’t behave. There are no clocks. My phone has no signal. I don’t remember arriving—only that people keep arriving after me and leaving before me.

A man sits beside me. He smells like antiseptic.

“They call you yet?” he asks.

“No.”

“They called me,” he says. “But the door didn’t open.”

I look at him. “Why?”

He shrugs. “Maybe I wasn’t… ready.”

“What does that mean?” I say, turning back to him. 

He vanishes.

No sound. No movement. Just gone. 

I walk to the receptionist.

“That man. He disappeared.”

She checks her screen. “He was processed.”

“But he didn’t leave.”

She looks at me carefully. “Everyone leaves.”

More people arrive. Some are crying. Some look relieved. Some look like they’ve just woken from surgery.

A woman sits beside me. She smells like rain.

“How long have you been here?” she asks.

“I don’t know.”

She nods. “I think I died yesterday.”

I laugh before I can stop myself. She doesn’t laugh.

“They said my body couldn’t hold me anymore,” she says. “But I wasn’t done.”

“Done with what?”

“Being.”

Her name appears. It glows softly.

She doesn’t stand.

The receptionist looks up. “That was your call.”

“I know,” the woman says calmly.

The screen flickers.

The receptionist types harder.

The woman leans toward me. “I can miss it, if you like.”

“Miss what?”

“Transfer.”

I look at my paper again. Smudged. Name fading.

The screen flashes another name before mine.

Then skips.

My chest tightens.

I walk to the desk.

“You passed me.”

The receptionist looks at my paper. Her smile finally breaks.

“Oh,” she says quietly.

“What?”

“You’re not in the queue.”

“What does that mean?”

She hesitates. “It means you’re already processed.”

Cold spreads through me.

“No. I never went through the door.”

She gestures to the room. “Not everyone uses the door.”

“Then where do I go?”

She doesn’t answer.

The woman who smells like rain stands. Her name appears again. This time, the door opens.

She looks back at me. “You don’t remember, do you?”

“Remember what?”

“You were here before any of us,” she says gently. “The onboarding video explained it all.”

I shake my head.

“You didn’t come in,” she continues. “You woke up.”

The screen glitches.

Lines of text scroll too fast to read.

The receptionist stands for the first time.

She sighs, like she’s tired of repeating the same truth.

“They call it Continuity Storage. When the body fails, the mind can be uploaded, archived. Most people pass through for minutes. Some for hours. Long enough for transfer.”

“Transfer to where?” I ask.

“Storage.”

My throat feels tight. “Then why am I still here?”

Her eyes finally meet mine.

“Because you’re not stored,” she says. “You’re the system.”

I shake my head. “That’s not—”

“You’ve been here since the first successful test,” she goes on. “Before Ego-Tech sold it. Your consciousness was never archived. It was… repurposed.”

“For what?”

“To hold everyone else,” she says softly. “Your mind is the bridge. The anchor. The thing their algorithms couldn’t build.”

I stare at the empty chairs.

“They don’t stay because they’re waiting,” she says. “They stay because you’re here to hold them steady long enough to leave.”

My voice is barely sound. “What happens to me?”

She hesitates. Just long enough.

“You don’t transfer,” she says. “You don’t finish.”

The room hums. Not with machines.

With me.

“And if I stop?” I ask.

She looks past me, at all the people who have already walked through.

“Then no one else ever will.”

The screen finally slows.

CONSCIOUSNESS BRIDGE: ACTIVE

PRIMARY ANCHOR: ONLINE

STABILITY: DECLINING

I stare at the words.

“I’m not waiting to leave,” I whisper.

“No,” the woman says. “You’re what keeps this place from falling apart.”

“The algorithm needs a human pattern,” the receptionist says. “Something that remembers what it feels like to be alive. Something it can model everyone else against.”

I back away. “I didn’t agree to this.”

“You did,” she says gently. “You said you didn’t want to disappear. You said you’d hold the door open for others.”

My stomach twists. The word others suddenly feels endless.

“How long?” I ask.

The receptionist doesn’t answer.

“How many?” I try again. “How many people will pass through me?”

She finally meets my eyes. “All of them.”

Panic hits like vertigo.

“I can’t— I’ll forget. I’ll fade.”

“That’s already happening,” she says softly.

The screen flickers again.

ERROR: PRIMARY ANCHOR DESTABILIZING

The woman steps through the door. It closes.

The room grows quieter. Emptier.

A new person appears at the entrance, shaking, clutching a paper.

“Is this where I wait?” they ask.

I look at the screen. The chairs. The receptionist.

I feel something inside me stretch thin—like a wire under too much weight.

I think about forever. About being awake when no one else is. About being a hallway people pass through without seeing.

My mouth opens. I don’t know if the words are mine anymore.

“Take a seat,” I say. “They’ll call you.”

The screen steadies. And I stay.

1qeekjw,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qeekjw,STUB FROTH: RUNNING VENEZUELA — Day Fourteen — THE BOOKS WON’T CLOSE,"THE BOOKS WON’T CLOSE

*January 16, 2026 — 7:07 AM ET*

This Substack is reader-supported. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.

It’s going to be freezing across the country today.

People will wake up late. Coffee will sit longer. The house will feel quieter than it should. Phones will get checked not because anything happened overnight, but because cold has a way of pulling attention inward. When the weather traps the body, the mind goes looking for something to make sense of the stillness.

This is the right day to say this plainly:

What’s happening in Venezuela isn’t about oil, democracy, or empire.  
It’s about the moment the books stopped closing — and everyone in charge realized it at the same time.

We keep talking about “running” Venezuela as if that sentence explains something. It doesn’t. It distracts. Running a country is theater. What’s actually happening is quieter, colder, and far more unsettling.

Someone is trying to reconstruct a balance sheet that no longer balances.

And they’re doing it without admitting that the loss of visibility — not ideology — is the emergency.

*“For decades, power meant knowing where the money was. Now it means knowing who might know.” —* *Stub Froth*

Venezuela exported oil at scale for twenty years. That should have produced something durable. A fund. A reserve. A traceable accumulation of sovereign wealth. Instead, there’s a void where certainty should be. Gold disputes. Frozen accounts. Sanctions-era opacity. Rumors of assets that never consolidate into a number anyone will stand behind.

That isn’t theft in the cinematic sense.  
That’s dispersion.

Value didn’t disappear. It scattered.

Oil sold at discount. Intermediaries inserted. Payments rerouted. Settlement pushed off the dollar. Custody fragmented across jurisdictions, shells, proxies, and — yes — digital rails that don’t need a flag to move.

The mistake is thinking this was clever.  
It was adaptive.

And adaptation at scale has a cost: eventually, nobody knows the full picture anymore.

*“When value escapes its paperwork, the panic doesn’t come from loss — it comes from not knowing who can pull the trigger.”* — *Stub Froth*

That’s why the operation moved fast. Not because Washington was confident — but because optionality was closing. When uncertainty reaches a certain density, delay becomes risk. And risk that can’t be bounded is the one thing capital refuses to tolerate.

So force was used. Then paperwork. Then custody. Then silence.

Each phase wasn’t escalation. It was containment.

Drugs justified the raid.  
Oil justified the stay.  
Stability justified supervision.  
Contractors justified deniability.

None of it explains the urgency on its own. Together, they explain a system trying to hold something still long enough to inventory it without triggering a confidence event.

This isn’t conquest.  
It’s recovery — of information.

*“When the state starts guarding assets it can’t fully inventory, sovereignty has already failed — just not where you think.” —* *Stub Froth*

Notice what hasn’t happened. There’s been no definitive denial of the asset rumors. No confirmation either. Just calibrated quiet. That silence isn’t emptiness. It’s leverage preservation. It buys time while institutions decide what they can safely acknowledge without shaking markets that now treat rumor as data.

That’s the uncomfortable truth nobody wants to say:

Belief moves faster than facts now.

A large, poorly documented pool of value doesn’t need to move to do damage. It only needs to be believed capable of moving. In a financial system stitched together by confidence, that belief alone can pressure ETFs, funds, pensions, counterparties — all downstream from assets we pretend are just “another class.”

They aren’t. Not yet.

*“A secret fortune isn’t wealth. It’s a hostage situation with a price chart.”* — *Stub Froth*

So the response isn’t transparency. It’s custody.  
Not truth. Not reconciliation. Not closure.

Escrow.

Escrow is what you use when ownership is contested, records are incomplete, and time is your only remaining ally. You don’t resolve. You hold. You supervise. You protect the perimeter while pretending you’re rebuilding the house.

That’s why contractors matter. Not because they’re sinister — but because they’re accountable to invoices, not voters. They’re the bridge between force and finance, between control and plausible distance. Soldiers raise flags. Contractors guard processes.

And processes don’t answer questions.

*“Empire doesn’t announce itself anymore. It files.”* — *Stub Froth*

This is where the public gets restless. They want morality. They want villains. They want clarity. Instead, they’re getting management. Metrics. Committees. Reviews. A slow replacement of visible decision-making with administrative momentum that doesn’t need permission to continue.

It feels boring. That’s the danger.

Because boring is how systems normalize before they harden.

What makes this moment different isn’t what was done to Venezuela. It’s what it revealed about everyone else. States no longer fully control the value they generate. They chase it after the fact. Sanctions don’t stop flows — they reroute them. Enforcement doesn’t eliminate risk — it displaces it into places nobody fully governs.

So now power is improvising. Guarding. Supervising. Hoping to reconstruct a ledger before someone else forces it open in public.

*“The most dangerous sentence in geopolitics isn’t ‘we’re going to war.’ It’s ‘this should be straightforward.’”* — *Stub Froth*

On a freezing Friday, with people home and scrolling, this is the thing worth sitting with:

This isn’t about Venezuela.  
It’s about a world where no one can close the books anymore — and everyone is pretending that’s temporary.

It isn’t.

The cold outside will pass.  
The silence won’t.

Because once value escapes its paperwork, power doesn’t get to reset the system.

It only gets to manage the fallout.

And right now, that’s exactly what we’re watching.

In 2026, the paradigm has flipped. With the explosion of autonomous AI agents, the most critical ""user"" of your API is no longer a developer with a cup of coffee, but an LLM-based agent seeking to complete a multi-step task.

This shift toward **Agentic Experience (AX)** is transforming API development from a static delivery mechanism into a dynamic, conversational exchange.^(1)



# From Human-Readable to Agent-Actionable

Traditional REST APIs rely on rigid documentation that humans interpret to write code. Today, the rise of the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** and AI-ready schemas is removing the middleman.

# 1. The Death of the ""Developer Portal""?

Standard portals are being replaced by **AI-accessible Knowledge Centers**.^(2) Instead of just hosting a Swagger UI, 2026-era backends publish metadata specifically designed for LLMs to ingest.



* **Semantic Descriptions:** Every endpoint now includes ""intent metadata""—rich natural language descriptions that tell an agent *why* it should call a specific function.
* **Sequence Mapping:** APIs now describe ""common workflows"" (e.g., ""To process a refund, call A, then B, then C"") so agents can plan multi-step actions without trial-and-error.

# 2. Adaptive Schemas and Mutable Flows

We are seeing the early success of **Mutable AI Flows**. Unlike the hard-coded logic of 2020, modern APIs can adapt their responses based on the agent's context. If an agent identifies itself as a ""Financial Auditor,"" the API might automatically include additional compliance metadata in the JSON payload that a standard ""User"" agent wouldn't receive.

# The Rise of ""Just-in-Time"" Infrastructure

The combination of AI code generation and serverless technology has given birth to **Ephemeral APIs**.

|**Concept**|**Traditional API (2022)**|**AI-Driven API (2026)**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Provisioning**|Permanent servers/clusters.|JIT (Just-in-Time) serverless instances.|
|**Code Base**|Static, versioned repository.|AI-generated ""edge functions"" on demand.|
|**Integrations**|Manual OAuth/Key exchange.|MCP-based ""handshake"" and discovery.|
|**Scaling**|Reactive (based on CPU/RAM).|Predictive (AI anticipates task load).|

Platforms like **DigitalAPI** and **Kuberns** now allow developers to deploy from an LLM prompt directly to a global edge network in one click, with AI-driven scaling that adjusts based on real-world usage patterns rather than simple traffic spikes.^(3)



# Security in the Age of Autonomy

As agents move from simple ""GET"" requests to high-value ""POST"" and ""DELETE"" actions, the risk of **Indeterministic Failure** increases. In 2026, security is no longer a firewall; it is a **Governance Layer**.

* **Audit Trails for Agents:** Every action taken by an AI agent is logged with the specific ""thought chain"" that led to the API call. This allows for forensic debugging of *why* an AI decided to delete a record.
* **Identity Delegation:** We use advanced scoping where a human grants an agent a ""temporary lease"" of authority. The agent doesn't ""own"" the API key; it borrows a cryptographic slice of the human's permissions.
* **Hallucination Filters:** Gateways now use smaller, specialized models to ""lint"" incoming agent requests, ensuring the payload structure isn't a hallucination before it ever hits the database.

# The New Developer Skillset: Prompt Architect

If the AI is generating the code and the agents are consuming the endpoints, what does the human developer do? They become **Prompt Architects** and **System Governors**.

We’ve been together a little over two years and moved in together last year. Overall, things are good. Not perfect, but good.

We’re pretty casual about sharing things. Not in a “what’s mine is yours forever” way, but more like… if you need a little milk, or a snack here and there, it’s fine. We don’t really talk about it. It just kind of happens.

Last week, I came home late from work. I was tired, hungry, and honestly a little cranky. I opened the fridge and saw a strawberry yogurt. My favorite. I knew immediately it was Jess’s. Mine were gone. I stood there for a second, fridge door open, just staring at it. I told myself I’d replace it the next day.

I ate it.

The next morning, Jess was in the kitchen, looking through the fridge.

“Hey,” she said, still looking inside. “Did you eat my yogurt?”

There was a pause. I said yes and told her I’d buy her another one after work. She nodded and said, “Okay,” but the vibe felt off. Quieter than usual.

A few days later, I noticed she’d been using my coffee pods. Not one or two. Like, a lot of them. I didn’t say anything at first. I felt weird bringing it up after the yogurt thing.

But then I bought a new box, and within a couple of days, half of them were gone. That night, I brought it up.

“Hey,” I said, trying to sound calm. “Can you not use my coffee pods? They’re kind of expensive.”

She looked at me, surprised. “Oh. I thought we shared stuff like that.”

I said, “Not really. I mean, small things sometimes, but these add up.”

There was this awkward silence. She crossed her arms and said, “You literally ate my food the other day.”

I felt embarrassed. I said, “I know. And I replaced it.”

She shrugged. “It just feels kind of unfair.”

I didn’t know what to say. I stood there holding my mug, wishing I’d waited or chosen different words. I finally said, “I just want us to ask first.”

She said, “Fine,” but not warmly, and went to the bedroom.

Since then, things have been… polite. Short conversations. No hanging out on the couch like usual. I keep thinking maybe I was too nitpicky, or maybe I shouldn’t have said anything at all, especially after eating her yogurt.
