A myth, if you will.
One of mystery. Of misplaced laundry. Of a woman so powerful, so cosmically chaotic, that even the universe’s weirdest disappearing act couldn’t take her down.

That woman?
Hi. It’s me. Call me Plastic.

It started like this: My boyfriend and I are staying at this motel in this backwards, glitchy little town. Not naming names, but let’s just say if Twin Peaks and Craigslist had a baby, it would be this ZIP code.

We find someone’s stuff—pictures, baby clothes, her whole emotional history—scattered perfectly across the back parking lot like some kind of tragic Pinterest flat lay. And just like that, she’s gone. No explanation. No follow-up.
Just gone.
The clothes were the goodbye.

Weeks later, my boyfriend looks me dead in the face and says:
“Plastic…..is that your stuff?”

And it was.
MY clothes.
Arranged.
Under the one working light in the pitch-black parking lot. Like someone said, “Let’s make this symbolic.”

I hadn’t even noticed they were missing yet. But somebody else did. Somebody who apparently wanted to give my wardrobe a send-off I did not consent to. And probably sniffed my panties  

And ever since? I keep seeing it.
	•	Piles of clothes in alleys.
	•	Toys painted weird colors.
	•	Trash cans staged like abstract art.
	•	People just… gone.

And no one reacts.
They’re just like, “Oh yeah, she went to rehab.” “He got a bus ticket home.” “They left.”
Left where? Narnia?

Someone whispered that it’s a sign. That the clothes are a marker. A warning. A flag for whoever’s out here making people vanish with the flair of a B-movie villain. I said fool what drugs are you doing cause share boo! lol  

Apparently, I was next.

But guess what?
I didn’t go anywhere.
I’m still here.
Not just surviving—I’m THRIVING IN MY OWN ORBIT, radiating anti-possession energy and drinking iced coffee like it’s holy water.

I didn’t get disappeared. 
I got louder.
I got weirder.
I got harder to erase.

So yeah.
The clothes always come first.
Because of course if I go missing, let’s be real obviously i will NEVER run away. Never leave my girls and it would be a setup. Cause I ain’t going out like some little biznatch.",1,1747642575.0,u_Famous-Plastic-5703,0,1.0,False
1kq6dux,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaximizeMe/comments/1kq6dux/struggling_with_cortisol_spikes_i_tried_cyclic/,Struggling with Cortisol Spikes? 🧠 I Tried Cyclic Sighing (Backed by Studies) for 7 Days to Optimize Calm Focus & Energy Reboot: Here's What Happened ⏰,"Hey MaximizeMe fam! 👋

Ever had one of those days where your brain feels like it's running on coffee and chaos? ☕️😅 Yeah, me too. It's like no matter how zen you try to be, there's this invisible stress DJ cranking up your cortisol levels and you just can't seem to hit pause. So, I decided to try something different... *cyclic sighing*. Yup, just like the dramatic sighs we do after a long day, but with a twist that's actually backed by science!

**Why Cyclic Sighing?**
Turns out, cyclic sighing isn't just for drama queens (or kings). There are studies suggesting that deliberately slowing down your breath with a focus on extended exhales can actually calm your nervous system, reduce stress hormones, and sharpen focus. Sounds like a miracle, right? 🎩✨

*Okay, I was skeptical.* But I thought, ""Why not give it a shot for seven days and see what happens?""

**Here’s what I did:**

1. **Morning Sigh Session**: I dedicated just 5 minutes after my morning coffee ritual to sit quietly and do this:
   - *Inhale deeply through the nose for about 4 seconds.*
   - *Hold it for a second.*
   - *Exhale slooowly through the mouth for 6-8 seconds.*

2. **Mid-Day Reboot**: Right when I hit that early afternoon slump (hello, 2 PM!), instead of reaching for another cup of coffee, I did a quick sigh session. I mean, hey, who needs caffeine when you have your own internal zen master? 🤔

3. **Evening Wind-Down**: Post-dinner, while Netflix plays in the background, I took a few minutes to cycle-sigh. It’s surprisingly relaxing when you’re wrapped in a blanket burrito on the couch.

**What Happened?**

- **Focus and Energy**: I felt a clearer head. I wasn't bouncing off the walls with energy, but tasks seemed less daunting, and mental fog lifted sooner than I was used to.
- **Stress Levels**: Let’s just say, those racing thoughts during stressful email marathons took a backseat. 🙌
- **Sleep Improvement**: Wow! My nights shifted from tossing around like a rotisserie chicken to feeling more refreshed in the morning.

**Personal Insight**: Honestly, I didn't expect such a big change from something as simple as breathing differently. But here's the kicker—it's FREE and you can do it anywhere. It's like having a pocket-sized superpower.

Anyway, have any of you tried anything to wrestle with stress or energize your day in a non-caffeinated way? Drop your experiences—I’d love to hear what works for you!

So next time you're feeling overwhelmed or your brain feels like a cluttered attic, try a sigh. Not the annoyed kind though—make it cyclic. Let's see how a little oxygen can go a long way in our pursuit of a calmer, more focused life. 💪

Alright, friends, let’s dive into the realm of focus! We all know that feeling, right? You sit down to tackle that project, and suddenly, your mind's wandering like a lost puppy. But what if I told you there’s a little trick that can flip the script? 

Here's my go-to: **The Pomodoro Technique.** Yep, I know, sounds fancy for something that just involves a timer and some tomatoes. 🍅 But hear me out!

### Why It Works:
- **Short Bursts of Focus**: You work for 25 minutes, and then you take a 5-minute break. It’s like giving your brain a mini vacation. Who doesn’t love that?
- **Makes It Less Daunting**: Instead of thinking, “I have to work on this for hours,” you just focus on making it through one little sprint. 
- **Builds Momentum**: You hit your goal, take a break, and then get excited for the next round.

### How to Do It:
1. **Set a Timer for 25 Minutes.** Seriously, just do it. No distractions allowed!
2. **Work on ONE Thing.** Focus on that email, report, or book. No multitasking! 
3. **When the Timer Goes Off, Take a 5-Minute Break.** Stretch, grab a snack, check your phone (but for real, limit it!).
4. **Repeat!** After four rounds, treat yourself to a longer break, like 15-30 minutes. You’ve earned it!

### A Little Humor:
Imagine trying to “power through” work like some over-caffeinated beaver. 🦫 All that energy can lead to burnout faster than you can say “I need coffee!” So why not trick your brain instead of forcing it to comply?

### What’s Your Secret?
Now, I know this worked wonders for me, but I’m super curious about your hacks. What little tricks keep you laser-focused? Do you have any weird rituals or apps that save your productivity bacon? Let’s hear those gems! 

Remember, we’re all in this together. If we can share even one focus hack, imagine how much more productive we can be! So what’s your secret sauce?",1,1747642372.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

1kq6blm,https://www.reddit.com/r/HJPackage/comments/1kq6blm/what_kind_of_packaging_do_young_folks_really_dig/,What kind of packaging do young folks really dig right now?,"Hey everyone! Just wanted to share some thoughts on what’s hot in packaging these days — especially from a young consumer’s perspective. Honestly, the packaging game is evolving rapidly, and brands are really trying to catch our attention with what they put around their products.

**First up: Eco-friendly everything.**  
Most of us are pretty woke about the planet, right? So, brands that use biodegradable plastics, recycled paper, or reusable containers totally get our attention. It feels good knowing that choosing a product won’t permanently harm the environment. Things like compostable coffee cups, refillable skincare bottles, or biodegradable tech accessories? We’re into that.

**Minimalist and clean design.**  
Let’s be real — we’re tired of cluttered, flashy packaging. We love simple, sleek, and aesthetic designs that look good on insta. Think: natural tones, minimal branding, and straightforward info. Less is more, and packaging that’s visually chill, yet high-quality, really strikes a chord.

**Unboxing experiences that feel personal.**  
Young shoppers love sharing their unboxing on TikTok or Instagram. So brands are coming up with creative, sometimes quirky packaging that surprises us — like cool stationery, handwritten notes, or packaging that doubles as a reusable item. Customization is also huge; stuff that feels personalized makes the experience special.

**Smart & interactive packaging.**  
QR codes, AR features, or even small puzzles on the packaging that you can scan or interact with? Yeah, that’s trending. It makes getting the product more fun and feels more connected.

**Recyclable and reusable designs.**  
A lot of brands now focus on making packaging that can be reused or easily recycled — think glass jars, fabric wraps, or boxes that you can repurpose for storage. It’s all about making sustainability effortless and stylish.

**Why it matters:**  
Basically, young people like brands that care about the planet, look aesthetic, and give us a cool, shareable experience. If a product’s packaging checks those boxes, we’re more likely to buy it and show it off online.

What about you guys? Do you have favorite packaging styles or brands that really get it? Would love to hear your thoughts and experiences!",1,1747642160.0,HJPackage,0,1.0,False
1kq6bi1,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1kq6bi1/the_technician/,The technician,"After my pc got damaged from overuse and excessive gameplays, I called the technician who had already repaired my pc earlier also, but he said he was out of town for some reason. 

He gave me phone number of some other technician he knew and told me that he would call him too. 

He texted me after some time that he had called him and he would soon come to repair the pc. I thanked him and gone to the kitchen for some food.

It was the next day. I completely forgot about all that and went for a bath. 

My doorbell rang and I was still in bathroom. I got my towel and gone to open the door.  

A guy who is age is same as me, wearing a blue uniform with a blue cap told me he was sent here. I remembered about that and had him in. 

He  talked with me about reducing the excess usage and I offered him some coffee. He took two hours to fully fix the pc. 

After paying him, he said good bye and I was again on my pc. 

The pc become good again and was running 
smoothly. I played Valorant for sometime and then head back to my work.

Searching my files, I found a unknown file named 'Brad.exe'. Brad is my name and I don't remember saving any file with my name. 

I didn't opened that file and called my technician. He didn't picked up his phone. 

I called the technician who came to my house. Upon dialing his number, it said incorrect number. 

I realised that I'm in a difficult situation now. I have seen many videos on internet telling not to open unknown files. 

So I tried to delete that file. I selected the file and pressed delete. But instead of deleting the file, it got opened. 

After opening, it shows a old, distorted video. 
Only play option was there. No other option worked. Even tried to turn off my pc. 

Surprisingly it turned off. I quickly tried to call the technician, but that didn't work . After an hour when I tried to turn on my pc, a music started playing.

At first the sound of music was low. The loading was black and no booting animation was showing. 

The sound got louder second by second and the screen emitted a red light. 

The screen turned on and it was playing something. A old, distorted and disturbing video. 

Two boys are showing tieing a man with a rope to a pillar. The two boys had hammers with them. The music became as loud to be able to hear perfectly.  

It was a song by a woman but it's so distorted that I can't hear every words. Only the rhythm is some what hearable. 

The boys had finished tieing the man. They started to beat the man with hammer and breaking his joints. 

The scream of the man and the laughter of the boys cannot be heard because of the music, but I can see that in the video. 

I tried to turn off my pc as earlier but an small screen shown in the screen. The small screen  said ""Is your pc fixed now"" while the video and music was playing in background.

The music became so loud and video was extremely gore and violent, the boys were breaking every body part with the hammer and man was screaming and was full of blood. 

I tried to call both the technician but no one picked the call. Till then the music was so loud that I couldn't hear my own voice. 

I had no option other than destroying the pc. I picked my chair and started beating the pc. The video and music still playing while I'm breaking the pc. 

After completing breaking the pc, I got tired and got a call on my phone, it was from my regular technician. I told about all the incident but he told that he forgot to call the technician and the number he gave I didn't called it till now. 

Then who was the guy who repaired my pc?
Thinking about that still gives me chills, but I didn't saw him after that day but I'm still living in the same apartment.

Do you know what you’ve done?
Do you know the hurt you’ve inflicted?
The wounds, the despair, the failure
Do you see other’s emotions?
do you care?

How deep your own pain must be
How raw the trauma 
The wound of that little boy
How insecure

Crying in the corner
Tossed aside like trash
Used for the pleasure of others
Never feeling the warmth of love

lashing out at friends
Undermining their success
casting them aside like filthy laundry
thinking you’re better

Let’s park that for now

Perceptions are everything
Yet they will be your downfall
They try to hide the truth yet reveal it 
The only one blind is the author 

Neither hot nor cold you preach
Never changing lives
Lukewarm coffee, 
Stale bread, 
Stagnant water
Neither thriving nor dying
Only the perception of building
But we see through that
More than you realize
Not to God’s glory but to yours

Oh for an open window
Where truth blows in like a breeze on a summers day
Where warm sunlight chases away the shadows of lies
Where integrity is free to play and run through the open meadow

Yet healing will begin
And has already
We will move on, grow, bring new life
Thrive, flourish, multiply

We will show mercy
Walk humbly
Act justly
Love our neighbour and our enemy
And our God
We will even love you

It’s hard for me to explain things but I’ll give it my best shot 🙂

So I feel like I’m more lesbian than bisexual now as when I see or interact with males I don’t feel attracted to them at all I used to all the time , I used to be highly attracted to men but now I’m not and the last date I went on with a guy didn’t go as I thought I was like this would be a nice coffee date but instead he thought my body was a toy 🤦‍♀️😔

I’ve had a lot of trauma from men but I can’t exactly say on here as reddit will delete my post 

What really sucks is that I’m too worried to go out with females as I just feel like no one will be happy to date me or attracted to me - I have very low self esteem after all the trauma I’ve experienced 

I’m also anxious with relationships as my last one ended horribly he ended up confessing to me that he didn’t actually want to date me and that I was ugly and stupid so now I’m really insecure and anxious about relationships as I just feel like no one will truly want to be with me and will be happy to date me 

I have a lot of trauma when it comes to doing stuff in bed and ngl I wouldn’t exactly know  what to do in terms of being with a female 

Sorry for a long read/post this has been on my mind/ chest for so long and I have no friends to talk to about this either because everyone left me when I bought up i had adhd to them even though I got diagnosed at 13 I’m now 22 😔

I'm very active going to the gym 4 times a week. I do some biking on my rest days. Hitting the gym has been very fun. I like to hike, adventures when I can, and look forward to traveling. Safe to say, I'm pretty active, but I do enjoy being a homebody. 

Since going to the gym, I've been cooking. That's been really fun. If you have any declious recipes, please do share.

Now, enough about me. Tell you about you! Your hopes , dreams, rant/vent. How is your life?

I do ask that you know how to have a conversation. If we get along and continue to talk awesome. If we dont, no hard feelings. Tis Life.

1kq63pq,https://www.reddit.com/r/ENFP/comments/1kq63pq/10_types_of_enfps/,10 Types of ENFPs,"See note at the end.

1. The Golden Retriever ENFP
Joy in human form. Always wagging an invisible tail. Says “hi” to strangers, pets every dog, sends you memes at 3 AM, and tells baristas their earrings are cute. Impossible to stay mad at, even when they completely forget plans you made a month ago. Deeply loyal once bonded. Often hides sadness under sparkle. (Though tbh, I feel like we all do this, I just had to blame someone and pretend like it's not all of us...🫣)

2. The Existential Philosopher ENFP
Looks like sunshine, but talks like Nietzsche. Constantly questioning everything. Big “laughs at funerals, cries during cereal commercials” energy (it's okay, we've all been there, and it's why we love you 😘🥰). They’ll throw out an idea that makes you rethink your entire worldview and then get distracted by a butterfly. Pretend they’re fine, but have an emotional depth that scares even themselves.

3. The Frenetic Visionary ENFP
Can’t sit still. Five notebooks. Ten tabs open. (Just checked - I'm currently at 3,497 tabs on my phone... Whatever 😒😏😎) Fifteen passion projects. Intimidating and inspiring all at once. Could either become a revolutionary leader or vanish into the woods mid-sentence. Magnetic. Intense. Usually saved by a friend who reminds them to drink water and file their taxes. (Those friends are everything - you know who you are 🥹😉😘)

4. The Soft-Hearted Healer ENFP
These are the counselors, the therapists, the “mom friend” types who absorb everyone’s pain like a sponge. You feel safe with them. They remember your dreams (I literally quoted my friend's dream from 2 months ago and she didn't even remember it 🙈) and ask how your grandma’s surgery went. Sometimes so focused on others that they forget to protect themselves. Give too many second chances.

5. The Chaotic Romantic ENFP
Falls in love twice a week, sometimes with fictional characters, sometimes with ideas. Makes playlists titled things like “for the boy who smelled like lilacs and disappointment.” Will text you “I just saw the moon and thought of you.” They’re sincere and chaotic and you’ll never forget them even if you only knew them for a week.

6. The Punk Idealist ENFP
Sweet on the inside, fire on the outside. Big energy. Loud opinions. Sharp eyeliner. Talks about injustice while helping you dye your hair in their bathroom sink. They want to save the world and also teach it how to love better. Probably vegan. Definitely has a strong “no tolerance for bs” policy - unless it's their own.

7. The Disarmingly Competent ENFP
Looks like a dreamer, but is secretly running five organizations. Shows up late but has already solved three of your life problems before you’ve had coffee. Brilliant, persuasive, and terrifying in a boardroom. Often mistaken for an ENFJ, but they’ve got way more chaos behind the curtain. Let them ramble, and the master plan will reveal itself.

8. The Art Goblin ENFP
I have a friend like this. Lives in a nest of fabric, broken jewelry, odd candles, half-finished projects, and dried flowers. Makes the most beautiful things out of trash and tears. Thinks in symbols and vibes. Regularly travels to the mountains for their routine ayuasca ""cleansing"". Their apartment smells like incense and possibility. You'll come over and leave feeling like you're in a folk tale now. Their chaos is sacred. Good guy.

9. The Self-Improvement Spiral ENFP
Reads seven self-help books in a weekend. Talks about shadow work while spiraling. Probably journals with color-coded pens and wants to heal their inner child by Thursday. They’re determined to become better humans but might burn themselves out trying. Needs friends who say “you’re already enough” and mean it. (Don't we all)

10. The “I Swear I’m an Introvert” ENFP
They’re tired. So tired. Says “I hate people” while sending heart emojis. Probably adopted by introverts who protect them like rare Pokémon. Needs ten hours alone after brunch, but still wants a voice note from you about your weird coworker. They love hard but recharge in absolute silence. They have their moments of sparkle... Moments...🥲 

There's definitely some overlap for me between 1,2,3,4,5, 7, and 9, but it feels like these are the categories - broadly speaking. Surprisingly, my friend from 8 is also 7, and my bestie is 4 + 6 + 10 (depressed but a healer) 🙃 and one of my closest bros is 3 + 6 + 8... So obviously, just like MBTI, people are complicated, but I feel like some people embody one of these types more than others. It's about prominence in their personality.",4,1747641189.0,ENFP,1,1.0,False

Six since Dad died.
But grief started before the dying,
when love quietly shapeshifted
into duty.

There’s been no break.
Not a day.
Not an afternoon
where someone said,
Hey, why don’t you go lie down?
So I stopped hoping
and started hauling.

Boxes.
Bins.
Decades of might-need-this.
Forty years of receipts,
disintegrating paper trails
to nowhere.
And always,
the rat piss.

The mildew.

The kind of breath
you take when you know
you’re breathing something
that might kill you,
but you keep going
because someone has to.

I don’t complain anymore.
Nobody likes a martyr
who speaks.
They like them quiet,
tired,
helpful.

Sometimes, I answer a call
just to remember how to speak
like a person again.
They tell me about their trip to the coast.
Their new kitchen.
How the light hits the backsplash
just right at sunset.
I nod,
in the dark,
next to a stack of yellowing Christmas cards
and boxes so heavy
they could make a strongman kneel.

They say, “You should take a vacation.”
I smile.
As if the word “vacation”
isn’t some cruel hallucination
my mind throws at me
when I find a photo
of my parents dancing
at a wedding I barely remember.

Sure, I’d like a beach.
Sure, I’d like a drink
in something hollowed out
and tropical.
But silly rabbit—
the only hollowed-out thing around here
is me.

I’m the one
sweeping the droppings of time.
I’m the one
sorting grief into piles:
Keep, Donate, Disintegrate.

I’m the one
wearing a pelvis that aches
like an old hinge
and a spirit
that cracks when the wind changes.

But nobody sees that.
Because I’m still standing.
Still calling the plumber.
Still mailing the forms.
Still remembering how they liked their coffee.
Still trying to matter
to people
who have clearly moved on.

And when I finally rest,
when I sit in the doorway
with a cold cup of something,
staring at a world
that forgot me—
I don’t cry.
Not really.
Not anymore.

I just go quiet.
Like the house does
when everyone leaves.",1,1747641039.0,grittytruth,0,1.0,False
1kq6262,https://i.redd.it/dx6kgcmx1p1f1.jpeg,F25🇧🇷 / looking for friends irl or online / 📍FFM-Germany.,"Hey everyone!
I moved to Germany about 2 years ago to be with my husband. At first, it was really tough — I felt isolated and found it hard to connect with people. I tried to make friends a few times, but it didn’t really work out, and that made me more anxious about trying again. But recently, I’ve started to open up more and I’m finally ready to put myself out there again.
I speak Portuguese and English, and I’m learning German (slowly but surely!). I’m a stay-at-home wife and I have a sweet cat named Tesla 🐱. I’m into anime, fashion, art, or just chatting about whatever — I’m pretty open-minded and love deep or silly conversations alike.
What I’m really looking for is true friendship.
I deeply miss having someone I can just text randomly about anything — whether it’s sending a meme, venting about the day, or talking for hours about life or nonsense. I miss going out with someone just to walk, grab a coffee, or do something spontaneous and fun. I’m really craving that real, genuine connection — someone I can be myself with, without pressure or judgment.
If you’re also looking for a low-pressure, easygoing but meaningful friendship, maybe we’d get along. I don’t care about age, gender, or background — just be kind, open, and up for building something real.
Oh, and I read Lenormand cards (a bit like tarot), if that’s something you’re curious about!

The cold iron gates of the prison in Hoverdale creaked open.    
  
Sunlight fell on Lauren Bennett's gaunt, sallow face.    
  
The clothes she had worn when she was incarcerated now hung loosely on her frail frame.    
  
She had endured five dark, endless years in prison. Today, she was finally free.  
  
Dragging her legs, Lauren hobbled out of the prison, step by slow step.    
  
She moved sluggishly, not because she didn't want to walk faster, but because she simply couldn't.    
  
A black Bentley was parked by the roadside. The window rolled down, revealing a man's deep-set, brooding face.    
  
His gaze swept over her injured leg. He let out a cold scoff, the mockery in his eyes blatant. ""After five years in prison, you're still putting on an act.""    
  
Lauren's heart clenched unexpectedly, and a sour sting rose in her eyes.    
  
Elliot Bennett was her biological brother.    
  
Ever since she had been brought back to the Bennett family from the orphanage at fifteen, she had done everything she could to please him.    
  
Yet for the sake of an adopted sister who wasn't even related to him by blood, he had personally falsified evidence to convict her of attempted murder.    
  
Five years had passed, and he was still as sharp-tongued and as disgusted with her as ever.    
  
Lauren swallowed the bitterness, pretending not to see Elliot as she limped forward.    
  
Elliot's face stiffened.    
  
She had ignored him.    
  
In his memory, Lauren had always clung to him, eager to please.    
  
When he came home, she would bring him his slippers.    
  
When he was tired, she would massage his shoulders.    
  
When he had trouble sleeping, she would bring him chamomile tea every night.    
  
When work kept him too busy to come home for dinner, she would wait outside his office with a thermos, undeterred by rain or shine.  
  
During the three years she had been in their home, his chronic stomach issues had eased. But ever since she went to prison, he had often woken up in the middle of the night from the pain.    
  
Today, he had actually felt a hint of joy when he heard she was being released. He had even postponed an international meeting to pick her up.    
  
He had expected her to be overjoyed at seeing him, had even prepared himself for her to break down and complain about the suffering she had endured.    
  
He had never imagined she would greet him with nothing but silence and indifference.    
  
The admiration in her eyes was long gone. All that remained was distance.    
  
A strange, hollow feeling rose in his chest, irritating him. His grip on the steering wheel tightened, veins bulging on the back of his hand.    
  
His voice came out harsher than he intended. ""Get in the car.""    
  
The moment the words left his mouth, he regretted them. With a frown, he forced himself to soften his tone. ""Dad and Mom know you're out today. They've prepared a welcome-home dinner for you.""    
  
*Dad and Mom. Such familiar yet foreign words.*    
  
In the orphanage, she had dreamed of having parents who would love her, who would spoil her like a princess.    
  
She had waited and longed for it for fifteen years.    
  
Fifteen years later, her wish had finally come true.    
  
She had parents now, even a tall, handsome, and capable brother.  
  
But the beloved daughter of the family wasn't her. It was the adopted daughter they had raised since childhood, Willow Bennett.    
  
Those people weren't her parents. They were Elliot and Willow's parents.    
  
Lauren scoffed at herself.    
  
During those three years in that family, she had endured endless cold shoulders and humiliation. She had always known she was unwanted. There was no reason to go back and subject herself to it again.   
  
Though she walked slowly, she never stopped.    
  
Her indifference, her stubborn retreat, stung Elliot's eyes and ignited a nameless fury in his chest.    
  
He pushed open the car door and strode after her, his long legs easily closing the distance. He grabbed her wrist and yanked her back. ""Have you had enough of this act?""    
  
Thrown off balance, Lauren crashed to the ground. Pain shot through her injured leg, her face turning deathly pale.    
  
Elliot's anger flared. ""Still playing weak? Is this your new trick?""    
  
""Don't forget, you were the one who pushed Elaine down the stairs five years ago and left her in a coma. You even tried to frame Willow for it. Five years in prison, and you still haven't learned your lesson? Looks like it wasn't enough to reform you.""  
  
With that, he grabbed her and hauled her up without an ounce of care. His voice was laced with disgust. ""Don't think your sentence erases your sins. As long as Elaine remains unconscious, your crime will never be absolved. And you still owe Willow an apology. Get in the car. Don't make me say it again.""    
  
Lauren only found it laughable.    
  
She had explained before. Elaine Gray wasn't pushed by her. It was Willow.    
  
But no one had believed her. They had all chosen Willow's side.    
  
She was the biological daughter of the Bennett family, yet everyone had placed their trust in Willow's words instead.    
  
She was guilty, indeed. Guilty of ever returning. Guilty of ever hoping for a love that was never hers.    
  
She had learned her lesson. She would change.    
  
She would leave, far away, and never again fight for the affection of a family that didn't want her.    
  
*Why is Elliot so displeased?*    
  
She calmly pulled her hand from his grip and took a step back, putting distance between them.    
  
Her deliberate withdrawal made Elliot's chest tighten with frustration. His mind flashed with images of the old Lauren, the girl who had once followed him around, desperately trying to win his favor.    
  
Suppressing his anger, he tried to soften his voice. ""Come home with me.""    
  
Lauren lowered her eyes, her expression blank, as if she couldn't even be bothered to look at him.    
  
Her lifeless demeanor made Elliot's rage boil over.    
  
Five years in prison, and if she had learned anything, it was how to grow a temper.    
  
Just as he was about to snap, a warm, gentle voice interrupted.    
  
""Laurie.""    
  
Lauren's body tensed. Her heart, which had been numb for so long, clenched in an instant.    
  
Even after five years, she recognized that voice immediately.    
  
It was Lucas Reed, her childhood friend.    
  
She saw a pair of polished leather shoes enter her line of sight. A deep, magnetic voice spoke above her.    
  
""Laurie, congratulations on your freedom.""    
  
If anyone else had said that, she would have politely replied, ""Thank you.""    
  
But coming from Lucas, the words grated on her ears.    
  
Her most trusted childhood friend, Lucas, had taken on his first case after graduation as Willow's defense attorney, the one who had put her behind bars.    
  
Before the trial, he had said to her, ""Laurie, Willow has never suffered before. She wouldn't survive in prison. Can you take the blame for her?""    
  
*Willow couldn't suffer, but I could?*  
  
Just because she was used to hardship, she deserved to take the fall for a crime she didn't commit.  
  
Sending the real Bennett daughter to prison had made Lucas famous overnight in Hoverdale.    
  
Five years ago, he had still been a fresh graduate, a little green around the edges.    
  
Five years later, he had become one of the city's most renowned attorneys, exuding power and confidence.    
  
They had grown up together in the orphanage, closer than real siblings.    
  
When other kids bullied her, he had always defended her, swearing, ""As long as I'm here, no one will ever hurt you.""    
  
He had promised that when he became a lawyer, he would put anyone who hurt her behind bars.    
  
But later, when Willow had hurt her time and time again, he had dismissed her pain with a casual, ""Laurie, you're too sensitive. Willow isn't like that.""    
  
In the end, it was he, of all people, who had protected the one who hurt her and personally sent her to prison.    
  
...  
  
The air grew heavy with silence.    
  
Lucas' smile slowly stiffened, but he forced himself to extend a hand toward her. ""Laurie, I came to pick you up...""    
  
Before he could finish, Lauren suddenly turned to Elliot. ""You said we're going home, right? Let's go.""



**Chapter 2 Why Didn't They Come?**



Lauren knew she couldn't escape.    
  
Lucas had once been the person she trusted and relied on the most. Now, he was the one she loathed and least wanted to face.    
  
Rather than confronting Lucas, she chose the next best option—going with Elliot.  
  
At least, from beginning to end, Elliot had always despised her.    
  
The first day she went back to the Bennett Residence, Elliot had warned her, ""Even if we share the same blood, in my heart, I only have one sister, and that's Willow. You'd better behave yourself. If I ever catch you bullying Willow, I won't let you off.""    
  
He never gave her hope, so she never had too much disappointment. In front of Elliot, the psychological wounds she suffered could at least be minimized.    
  
It was better than being utterly destroyed by the one closest to her.    
  
Prison had taught her a lesson.    
  
When lacking power, status, or support, survival depended on minimizing harm by any means possible.  
  
So, when her cellmates toyed with her and made her choose between disfigurement and a slap, she chose the slap.    
  
When they made her choose between being beaten and kneeling, she chose to kneel.    
  
When they made her choose between drinking toilet water and barking like a dog, she chose to bark.    
  
She had fought back desperately before, but the more she resisted, the worse the beatings became. To stay alive, she threw away her dignity and let herself be used.    
  
Even when thrown among the most vicious criminals, she had still managed to survive, barely hanging on, by knowing when to avoid harm.    
  
Lauren walked toward Elliot's black Bentley.    
  
As she brushed past Lucas, her expression remained indifferent. She didn't even spare him a glance.    
  
The loose T-shirt skimmed past Lucas's fingertips. The emptiness of the touch didn't feel like fabric draping over a person. It was more like cloth hanging on a lifeless mannequin.    
  
Lucas' hand froze midair. In that instant, it felt like the air around him had solidified, leaving only that cold, hollow sensation at his fingertips.    
  
Pain and desolation flashed through his eyes, and his heart felt as if an invisible hand had clenched it tight, every beat throbbing with dull agony.    
  
Once, her gaze had always followed him, full of trust and dependence.    
  
They had grown up together in the orphanage, supporting each other. Whenever he called her name, she would always smile and answer, ""Luca, I'm here.""    
  
But now, time had changed everything.    
  
She looked right through him, as if he didn't exist, unwilling to even meet his eyes.    
  
Lucas' lips trembled slightly. He wanted to speak, but his throat felt blocked, unable to make a sound.    
  
Lauren got into the car and sat in the back seat. Everything in sight bore traces of another woman.    
  
The passenger seat had a fluffy pink cushion. The dashboard was lined with an entire row of adorable bear figurines. In the rearview mirror, the woman's reflection looked more mature than five years ago, more alluring.    
  
She was beaming, the kind of smile that only someone raised in comfort and luxury could have.    
  
That happiness on her face was like a silent taunt, mocking Lauren as the fake heiress.    
  
She had thought she could face all this indifferently. But seeing it with her own eyes still left a bitter sting in her chest.    
  
Lauren withdrew her gaze, but her eyes inadvertently landed on the handbag beside her.    
  
Inside was a pristine white gown. Even without seeing the whole dress, the intricate feather embellishments hinted at its elegance.    
  
Her fingers unconsciously rubbed against the rough denim of her jeans.    
  
Every detail inside the car reminded her that she didn't belong here.    
  
From head to toe, she wasn't even worth as much as the gown in that handbag.    
  
She turned to look out the window. The scenery blurred past in a rapid retreat.    
  
Elliot, still driving, didn't forget to warn her, ""Mom and Dad have missed you so much these past five years. They cried over you every day, their hair turning gray with worry. When you get home, keep your temper in check. I don't want to see you scheming against Willow again, making things difficult for them. As long as you behave, the Bennett family won't treat you unfairly.""    
  
Silence followed his words.    
  
Hearing no response, Elliot frowned in displeasure and glanced at her through the rearview mirror.    
  
""Lauren, I'm talking to you. Did you hear me?""    
  
Lauren finally looked up at him and spoke the longest sentence she had since leaving prison.    
  
""According to Article 48 of the Prison Law, inmates are allowed visits from family or guardians once a month, for thirty minutes to an hour. I was imprisoned for five years; that will be sixty months. If I had one visit per month, I could have seen them sixty times. But I never saw them once. You say your parents missed me. Then why didn't they come? Were they so busy that they couldn't spare even thirty minutes a month?""    
  
Her voice was calm, but every word was a blade, slicing through his lie without mercy.    
  
Guilt and panic flickered across Elliot's eyes. The reprimand he had prepared was caught in his throat, unable to come out.    
  
Avoiding her steady yet piercing gaze, his fingers instinctively tightened around the steering wheel, his knuckles turning white from the pressure.    
  
""It... It's because you were too hard to discipline. Mom and Dad didn't visit you because they wanted you to focus on correcting your bad behavior. They did it for your own good.""    
  
*For my own good? Letting me take the fall for Willow, making me suffer in prison... So, that's their idea for my own good. What a joke.*    
  
Lauren felt drained, utterly uninterested in arguing anymore. She turned her gaze back to the window.    
  
Before long, the car pulled into the Bennett Residence garage.    
  
Elliot seemed pleased. He grabbed the handbag from the back seat and hurried off.    
  
A few steps away, he suddenly remembered Lauren. His body stiffened, and when he turned back, there was still a trace of awkwardness on his face.    
  
""Go change into a proper gown and head to the banquet hall.""    
  
With that, he left without looking back.    
  
After five years, this house was still as unfamiliar to Lauren as ever.    
  
She had never felt an ounce of warmth here.    
  
This place wasn't even as good as the orphanage.    
  
At the orphanage, she hadn't had a private room, but at least she had shared a sunlit dorm.    
  
When the sun rose, light would pour through the windows, filling the room with warmth.    
  
Back then, she loved the scent of blankets basked in sunlight. It made her feel like she had a home.    
  
But after returning here, she realized that her so-called home wasn't the scent of sun-warmed blankets.    
  
It was the damp, musty stench of a place the sun never reached.    
  
She pushed open the door.    
  
The room was small, windowless, and packed with clutter.    
  
The only two pieces of furniture were a single folding cot and an old desk.    
  
This was the storage room that served as her bedroom for three years.    
  
Elliot had told her to wear a proper gown.    
  
But she had never owned one.  
  
For years, she had only had one set of her high school uniform. The T-shirt and jeans she was wearing now had been bought with money she earned from a holiday job on Amazon, for five bucks total.    
  
She still remembered the day she had happily put them on and asked Elliot how she looked.    
  
His brows had furrowed in disgust.    
  
""What the hell are you wearing? Can't you learn to dress elegantly and properly like Willow? Take it off and get rid of it! Don't embarrass our family.""



**Chapter 3 Canceled Her Allowance**



Willow's poise and elegance had been built with money and resources.    
  
In contrast, Lauren had nothing.    
  
The Bennett family neither gave her much love nor much money, yet they still blamed her for not being poised and elegant enough.    
  
Even now, she didn't understand why they had brought her back.    
  
Her only purpose in this family was to make Willow, the adopted daughter, seem more beloved.    
  
There was a saying, ""Those who are unloved are the outsiders."" It fit her unexpectedly well.    
  
Back then, their unfairness had made her sad. Now, she no longer cared.    
  
She scanned the storage room. The only clothing she had to change into was her old blue-and-white high school uniform.    
  
Five years ago, she had received an acceptance letter from Northcrest University, the top institution in Corwynale.    
  
Yet, the Bennett family had only thrown a grand celebration for Willow's college entrance.    
  
That banquet had gathered every elite figure in Hoverdale.    
  
Eighteen-year-old Willow had stood in the center of it all, draped in a custom-made gown worth millions, wearing a diamond-studded crown, basking in the spotlight like a princess between her adoptive parents.  
  
Meanwhile, Lauren had looked shabby and out of place, an ugly duckling among swans. Under the gaze of the entire crowd, she had been taken away by the police, spending the next five years in prison, losing the college life that should have been hers.    
  
...  
  
Five minutes later, dressed in her uniform, Lauren headed toward the banquet hall of the Bennett Residence.    
  
On the way, passing servants cast curious glances at her.    
  
""Who's that? Why is she here in a high school uniform?""    
  
""She's probably one of the hotel staff brought in for the event. Looks like a student working a summer job.""    
  
""Mr. David and Madam Alice treat Ms. Willow so well. They even invited the top chef from Lavette Grand Hotel just for her celebration.""    
  
""Exactly.""    
  
As one servant walked past Lauren, they didn't forget to remind her, ""The banquet is about to begin. Go change into the standard uniform. You must be careful while serving. Tonight's guests are all important figures in Hoverdale.""    
  
With that, the servant left.    
  
Lauren stood there, suddenly losing the desire to go to the banquet hall.    
  
Elliot had told her that her parents had prepared a welcome banquet for her. But he hadn't mentioned that they had invited outsiders.    
  
Being released from prison was nothing to celebrate.   
  
*Did they really need to make such a spectacle out of it?*    
  
Five years ago, she had been taken away in handcuffs in front of all of Hoverdale's elites.    
  
Now, they wanted to gather those same people and publicly celebrate the return of a convict.    
  
To her, this wasn't a welcome. It was a public humiliation, stripping away every last shred of dignity she had left.    
  
A mix of bitterness and anger surged within her. She didn't want to stay here any longer.    
  
She turned to leave.    
  
But just then, Elliot appeared, his expression darkening the moment he saw what she was wearing.    
  
He strode toward her, his voice sharp with irritation. ""Didn't I tell you to change into a gown? Why did you come dressed like this? Do you have any idea what kind of occasion this is?""    
  
Lauren opened her mouth to explain, but Elliot cut her off mercilessly.    
  
""You looked like a mess when you got out of prison, and now that you're back, you want to put on a pitiful act in front of everyone? Do you want people to think the Bennett family has mistreated you? Lauren, your manipulative tricks are just as disgusting as ever. You're beyond saving.""    
  
As he spoke, he reached out to grab her, still cursing under his breath. ""Go change. Stop embarrassing yourself!""    
  
Lauren sidestepped him.    
  
Elliot's hand caught nothing but air. His anger flared. ""How dare you dodge me?""    
  
Lauren lifted her gaze to meet his. He looked at her as if she were his worst enemy.    
  
That look—disgusted, impatient, filled with contempt—she had endured it for three years in the Bennett family.    
  
Every time their eyes met, it felt like invisible hands were tearing her heart apart. The tears she had once held back had only ever earned her a sneer of ""stop acting.""    
  
Maybe she had gotten used to it.    
  
Or maybe five years in prison had crushed her self-worth.    
  
Now, even as she faced his deep-seated hatred, she felt nothing.    
  
His opinions no longer had the power to affect her.    
  
Lauren's expression remained calm, distant, unyielding. ""I don't have a gown.""    
  
Elliot's fury grew. ""If you don't have one, then buy one!""    
  
Lauren took a deep breath. Elliot was too biased against her. No matter what she said, he wouldn't believe her.    
  
She had tried explaining in the past.    
  
But the more she explained, the more he accused her of lying. He had slandered her without restraint.    
  
It was exhausting. She didn't want to explain anymore.    
  
So she simply said, ""I have no money.""    
  
Elliot's brows knitted together, his rage burning hotter. ""For three years, you lived here without worrying about food or clothing. The company transfers 70,000 dollars to your account every month. Over three years, that totaled 2.5 million dollars. And you're telling me you couldn't afford a decent dress? You're doing this on purpose, trying to make people think our family mistreated you! Lauren, you can't be this selfish. We've already compensated you. Enough is enough. If you keep acting like this, it's just pathetic!""    
  
Lauren had expected this. No matter what she said, she would never be believed.    
  
She stared at him, unblinking.    
  
For some reason, under her steady gaze, Elliot felt a brief pang of unease.    
  
""What are you looking at me like that for? I didn't say anything wrong.""    
  
*He isn't wrong?*    
  
Lauren let out a cold, silent laugh.    
  
She hadn't wanted to make a scene.    
  
But Elliot's aggressive accusations stirred something dark in her.    
  
Out of the corner of her eye, she noticed people approaching.    
  
Since they wanted a commotion, she would give them one.    
  
She had already lost her dignity. She had nothing left to lose.    
  
But Elliot, who cared so much about his reputation, couldn't handle being humiliated in public.   
  
""I never received a single cent from your company. Not 70,000 dollars. Not even seven bucks. Mr. Elliot, if you want to accuse me, at least come up with a more believable lie.""    
  
Elliot's eyes darkened with even more disgust.    
  
""You just won't give up, will you? Fine. Don't blame me for exposing you.""    
  
He pulled out his phone and called the company's finance department, putting the call on speaker.    
  
""Check how much money the finance department has transferred to Lauren's account every month.""    
  
The person on the other end hesitated. ""Lauren? You mean Ms. Bennett?""    
  
""Yes.""    
  
""Mr. Elliot, if you're referring to Ms. Bennett, there's no need to check.""    
  
Elliot frowned. ""What do you mean?""    
  
""Well, we never transferred any money to Ms. Bennett's account.""    
  
Elliot froze.    
  
""That's impossible,"" he said sharply.    
  
*Lauren may not be well-liked, but she's still the daughter of the Bennett family. How could she not have an allowance?*  
  
The night she was brought home, he had discussed it with his parents. To be fair, they had decided to give Lauren the same monthly allowance as Willow.    
  
There was no way he had remembered it wrong.    
  
""I personally gave the order.""    
  
""Mr. Elliot, you might not know this, but Madam Alice said that Ms. Bennett came from an orphanage and had poor judgment. She was afraid Ms. Bennett would fall in with the wrong crowd if she suddenly had that much money. Since Ms. Bennett was a high school student back then and had no major expenses, Madam Alice canceled her allowance.""    
  
Elliot's mind buzzed.    
  
*No allowance... That means Lauren hasn't received a single penny in the entire three years she's lived with us.*  
  
""Oh, and Madam Alice doubled Ms. Willow's allowance to 140,000 dollars a month. She was worried Ms. Willow would feel neglected, so the extra 70,000 dollars was meant to comfort her. You knew about that, right, Mr. Elliot?""    
  
Elliot felt like someone had strangled him.    
  
He had not known.



**Chapter 4 You Have No Idea**



As the crowd grew, more and more people gathered around, all having heard the voice coming from the telephone receiver.    
  
Everyone present was stunned.    
  
The Bennett family wasn't the richest in Hoverdale, but it was still a prominent aristocratic household.    
  
For children of wealthy families, having a monthly allowance of 14,000 dollars was perfectly normal.    
  
They had never heard of a wealthy heiress who didn't even get a single cent in allowance.    
  
The Bennett family was the first.    
  
No wonder Lauren dressed so poorly, without even a decent gown to wear to a banquet.    
  
Even if she hadn't been raised by their side, she was still the real daughter of the Bennett family. Yet they gave her nothing while showering their adopted daughter with 140,000 dollars a month.    
  
For the Bennett family to allow such an outrageous situation to happen, they must have been utterly blind.    
  
The guests whispered among themselves. Elliot felt a chill down his spine, his face flushing with shame and anger.    
  
He refused to believe something so humiliating could happen to the Bennett family.    
  
Their family was wealthy and powerful. There was no way they would be too stingy to give their own flesh and blood a mere allowance.    
  
Elliot immediately questioned Lauren in a cold voice, ""Even if the finance department didn't transfer the money, Mom and Dad must have given you an allowance, right?""    
  
Lauren's lips curled in mockery. She glanced at David Bennett and Alice Pierce in the crowd and said lightly, ""Why don't you ask Mr. David and Madam Alice whether they gave me an allowance or not, Mr. Elliot? After all, you don't believe me, but you'd believe your parents, wouldn't you?""    
  
David and Alice stiffened instantly, too ashamed to meet her eyes.    
  
""Dad, Mom, you must have given her an allowance, right?"" Elliot looked at them seriously.    
  
David avoided his gaze. ""I thought you guys would give it to her, so I...""    
  
Alice's face was filled with guilt, tears welling in her eyes. She said painfully, ""I thought you guys would... Laurie, why didn't you say something sooner? If you had told me earlier, I would have given you money. It's my fault. I didn't realize it in time, and you suffered for it. But you have to believe that I treat you and Willow the same.""    
  
Lauren looked at her with a half-smile, her gaze indifferent. Under her cold stare, Alice lowered her eyes awkwardly.    
  
Only today did Lauren find out that it was her own birth mother who had ordered the finance department not to send her money. Not only that, but she had also raised Willow's allowance to 140,000 dollars, afraid that her precious adopted daughter might feel slighted.    
  
With such blatant favoritism, Alice still had the audacity to claim she treated them equally.    
  
As the esteemed wife of a wealthy family, Alice wore only the finest clothes, with even her socks costing dozens of dollars. There was no way she couldn't tell that her own daughter was wearing an outfit that cost less than 14 bucks in total.  
  
Of course, she knew. She just didn't care.    
  
This apology was nothing more than an act for the public.    
  
Fortunately, Lauren had long seen through the ugliness of this family. Her heart had been hardened, immune to their poison. Without expectations, she remained unshaken.    
  
Seeing Lauren ignore her mother's apology, humiliating the Bennett family in front of everyone, Elliot's fleeting guilt instantly vanished.    
  
He scolded coldly, ""You have a mouth, don't you? Why didn't you just say something? We're not mind readers; how were we supposed to know what you were thinking? If you had spoken up earlier, do you think we wouldn't have given you money?""    
  
""I did."" Lauren's voice was soft but laced with coldness. ""You just didn't take it seriously.""    
  
Elliot frowned, about to deny it, when a memory suddenly surfaced in his mind.    
  
It was an afternoon long ago. Their family of four sat on the couch, chatting and laughing.    
  
Lauren walked over hesitantly, clutching the hem of her school uniform. Before she even spoke, her face flushed bright red.    
  
She struggled for a long time before finally whispering, ""Dad, Mom, can you give me the tuition fee of 700...""    
  
*Bang!*    
  
Elliot slammed his newspaper onto the coffee table, glaring at Lauren. ""Money, money, money! Is that all you care about? Did you come back to this family just to ask for money? If the Bennett family had no money, would you have even bothered to return? I don't know why Mom and Dad insisted on bringing you back. If you have nothing better to do, go study. Willow ranked tenth in the whole school in her first monthly exam. What about you?""    
  
""I... I got first place....""    
  
""Enough. You mean dead last, right? And you still have the nerve to bring it up?""

Context:   
I met a girl last year. She and I vibe quite well pero ang issue is she's recovering from a heartbreak. That time nalaman nya na niloloko sya ng bf nya with another girl and ang masama is dun pa sa girl nya nalaman lahat ng yun. Alam ko situation nya that time. I know the risk pero I continue kasi I know sa sarili ko na I'll be a better partner than her ex. So lumipas na nga ang ilang buwan. We talked and talked. We shared stories about our lives. Siguro lahat na ng dapat pagusapan napagusapan na namin. Pero ramdam ko pa rin sa kanya ung nililimit nya sarili nya. Na she's still drawing a line samin. Sobrang confusing din kasi nya kasi minsan sobrang clingy nya sakin or sobrang sweet. I was blinded by it. In the span on 5 months pinakita ko sa kanya na I'm better than her ex. I took care of her. I care for her a lot. I give everything that she likes. (Pero hindi sya humihingi sakin) Never syang humingi or nagrequest sakin ng gifts or anything. I just gave her things na kelangan nya or need nya pero lahat un gusto lang ibigay sa kanya kasi I want her to be happy. I thought na maayos ung lahat pero hindi pala. Sa kasamaang palad kapitbahay lang din nya ung guy. And still close sila ng parents nung guy. Also nagwowork sya sa coffee shop ng family nung guy. So kala ko nakakapagmove on sya pero in the end wala palang progress. I know everything pero di ko sya sinabi sa kanya kasi in the first place ginusto ko naman to. Di naman nya ako pinilit. I just take the risk. Tas un na nga her ex e umuwi na pala sa pinas. and nagulat ako bigla syang nagchat sakin na baka muna di sya makakapagchat kasi kala nya okay sya pero hindi pa rin pala. very cryptic that time kasi di ko alam na nakauwi na ung guy. Pero may kutob na ako. I waited kasi I know kelangan nya ng time. Pero nakausap ko sya for the last time and she told me nga na umuwi tong si ex. Nagsorry daw. Lumuhod. and sabi e last na un di na mauulit. Na kesyo babawi daw sya. Etong isa naman e lumambot agad. Nagulat ako syempre. I ask her na anong plano nya mangyare? Gusto daw nya bigyan ng chance pero still naguguluhan pa rin sya. Sobrang nainis ako kasi ganun na lang ba kadali magpatawad sya sa taong nanloko sa kanya harap harapan. Hindi ko na rin alam sasabihin ko that time. Sabi nya sakin nung dumating daw ung guy ulit parang nawala ung lahat at sumaya ulit sya. like wtf. I'll ask her if naging masaya din ba sya sakin? She said yes but mas nangingibabaw pa rin ung saya nya dun sa guy. Yun ung time na I told myself na tama na. I shouldn't chase this girl na. Sayang lang.

1kq5zrs,https://www.reddit.com/r/BeyondTheBumpUK/comments/1kq5zrs/3_year_old_rarely_listening_doing_as_we_ask/,3 year old rarely listening / doing as we ask,"My husband and I have the most wonderful, clever and loving 3 year old. She began talking months before her nursery classmates and overall is a happy natured kid. She sleeps very well throughout the night (7.30pm / 8pm to 7am / 7.30am) but doesn't really nap much any more.

Lately, I mean the past 6 weeks or more, she has been ignoring our requests. We're pretty easy going, we let her free play or almost do whatever she wants as long as it's not causing anyone any harm or herself any harm (e.g. if she wants to rearrange the saucepan cupboard while I have a coffee, go ahead kiddo). Honestly I think the only strict rules we have are the bedtime routine (same time, same routine), no playing with food, and no throwing toys of any kind in the house (learned that lesson the hard way ... RIP beautiful TV). And these we have no issues with.

However, as an example of where we are struggling, this morning my husband said to her, come here please, time to brush your teeth. She stayed where she was. He said again, please come here, it is time to brush. And she ignored him and walked further away. So he firmly said, come here now. Teeth now! Which made her start bawling and screaming and the subsequent teeth brushing was then traumatic for everyone involved.

It's the same with almost every request, she dumped her basket of small figurines all over the kitchen floor and flounced away, I calmly said honey you or mummy will step or trip on those, please put them back in the basket. I was met with silence. I said calmly, tidy those toys up. She said no, I don't want to, I said ok if you don't tidy them up now I am going to take X toy away, again she ignores me so I take X toy away and she has a meltdown.

We try to follow the same formula : ask once, ask twice, ask a third time with a threat (e.g. taking X toy away) but lately we've just been so tired and run down that we skip the formalities and just default to the firm voice instead of politely asking because we know we'll be ignored the first two asks. And we're not nit picking, it's things like not leaving trip hazards right Infront of the oven, or time to put shoes on, or hold my hand crossing the road. 

My husband and I work full time and have no village. We are exhausted and we are ashamed because we feel like we've turned in to those parents that are always stressed out and inpatient with their kid. Recently my daughter has been asking me 'mummy why are you so angry' and I felt so so guilty and explained sometimes mummy does get angry but not at you. 

I didn't give many examples of her not listening here because otherwise it'd be a wall of text. I'm just not sure how to handle this. I know it is developmentally normal and it will pass, I know there's no magic spell to get her to instantly do as she told, but is there any other option other than threatening to take toys away or something? I hate doing it and while I always follow through with my threat I hate how upset it makes her, it makes me feel like a monster.

I try to pick my battles, let her have some control, e.g. like the other day the only way I could brush her teeth was if I let her do a little dance on the spot as I brushed, it made brushing difficult and probably dangerous but often the more I tell her not to do something, the more attention I give the behaviour the more she does it, so I let her dance while I brushed her teeth.

I'm wondering if something is bothering her, she is not poorly but she has recently mastered potty training (well just peeing, she still poos in a nappy and we can't convince her to poo in the potty), I know that's a big step. And she doesn't really nap any more, I know she needs it but it's almost impossible to get her to actually nap most days, and we try implementing quiet time but she lasts all of ten minutes before she wants to do something more exciting. And I have noticed lately that she is a bottomless pit when it comes to food which isn't like her, usually she only grazes her meals but lately she's just been asking for more and more food so maybe a growth spurt?

And lastly this has taken a toll on our relationship. We try to be a team, us against the threenager, but because we reserve all our patience for her, we end up snippy with eachother and it fucking sucks.

TL;DR 3 year old doesn't do as she's told. Need to lower expectations or just stick to our guns?? Send help please???",2,1747640701.0,BeyondTheBumpUK,2,1.0,False
1kq5zm2,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1kq5zm2/someone_always_lives_there/,Someone Always Lives There,"I wasn’t the one who noticed the house.

That was Marv.

He lived across the street from me—retired electrician, mid-sixties, set in his routines. Bit of a worrier, but harmless. The kind of guy who trimmed his hedges with a level, watered the sidewalk cracks, and knew if a squirrel had farted three houses over.

If something was off in the neighborhood, he’d spot it before the rest of us even knew what “off” looked like.

One morning, I was grabbing my mail when he called out from his porch.

“Hey, Ricky! C’mere a second!”

I figured he was about to rant about trash day again, but instead, he just pointed down the block toward the house at the end. Faded gray siding. Two stories. Closed garage. Blank windows. Porch light that flicked on like clockwork.

“You ever seen the guy who lives there?” he asked.

I squinted. “Dunno. Moved in what… two years ago? Quiet guy, I guess.”

“Yeah, but have you seen him?” Marv’s voice dropped. “Like… taking out trash, getting the mail? Anything?”

I thought for a second. Then frowned. “Now that you mention it… no. Not once.”

He nodded like he’d been waiting to hear that. “That porch light comes on every night at exactly 3:12. Never earlier. Never later. No car. Mailbox’s always empty—but I’ve never once seen him check it.”

We stood there for a moment, just watching.

It wasn’t that the house looked creepy. That was the worst part.

It didn’t look like anything.

Just a house.

And somehow, that made it worse.

“I think we should check it out,” he said.

I laughed. “You serious?”

“What if he’s dead in there? Slipped in the shower. Been lying there for weeks.”

“If that were the case, the mail would’ve piled up. Place would stink. Somebody would’ve noticed.”

He looked at me.

“Exactly. Somebody. And now we are.”



I should’ve walked away.

But Marv was already headed down the sidewalk, robe flapping, coffee sloshing.

“Marv, don’t,” I called out—but he didn’t even turn around.

So yeah—I followed.

Not because I cared about the guy in the house. I followed because I was worried about Marv. He had a history of obsessing over things. A few years back, he spent three straight days logging the frequency of a transformer hum he was convinced was off by half a hertz.

This felt like one of those moments.

But different, too.

The closer we got, the quieter everything became. No wind. No birds. Just that kind of dense, ringing silence that makes your heartbeat feel like a drum in your head.

We stepped onto the driveway.

No car. No oil stains. Lawn wasn’t long, but it wasn’t cut either. Just… untouched. Like time skipped it.

Marv climbed onto the porch.

I stayed back.

“You sure you want to do this?” I asked.

“I didn’t come all this way to admire the siding.”

He knocked. Three sharp raps.

We waited.

Nothing.

No footsteps.

No floorboards creaking.

No one peeking through the blinds.

He knocked again—louder this time.

Still nothing.

Marv turned and gave me a look like that proved everything.

Then he crept to the front window, cupped his hands to the glass.

“Seriously?” I said. “You’re going full Rear Window now?”

“I’m not breaking in,” he muttered. “I’m just looking.”

I stepped up beside him.

Inside, it was clean. Couch. Coffee table. TV flickering with a screensaver loop. A single mug sitting on the table. Half-full.

“See?” I said. “Someone lives here. Just a recluse.”

“No pictures,” Marv said. “No mail. Nothing on the walls.”

“Some people like it simple.”

“Or maybe,” he said, “they want it to look like someone lives here.”

Then he went still.

“Upstairs,” he whispered.

I followed his gaze.

At the top of the stairs—through the narrow hall—I thought I saw… something. A shape. A figure maybe. Still and shadowed.

I blinked. Squinted.

It was gone.

Or maybe it was never there.

Marv stepped back slowly. “Someone’s in there.”

I didn’t answer.

Because for the first time since I moved to this neighborhood, I wasn’t sure I was alone in my own head.



That night, Marv wouldn’t stop.

He texted me screenshots of the porch light turning on. Timestamps. Circles around the same flicker in the same upstairs window.

He was unraveling.

But here’s the thing.

So was I.

Because we were both watching now.

And nothing ever changed.

No car.

No visitors.

No movement.

So we called the police.

Not 911. Just a wellness check.

“Never seen the guy,” we told them. “Something feels off.”

They sent a patrol unit the next morning.

Marv and I sat on my porch, drinking coffee, watching the cruiser roll up.

The officer walked up calmly.

Raised his hand to knock.

But before his knuckles hit wood—click—the door opened.

No footsteps. No delay.

No hesitation.

The cop didn’t flinch. Just stood there, relaxed.

“Just checking in, sir. Got a call from your neighbors. Everything alright?”

We waited for a voice.

There wasn’t one.

Still, the officer nodded. “Alright. Take care, sir.”

Then he walked away like nothing was wrong.

We asked if the guy was okay.

“Yep. Fine.”

No name.

No description.

Just fine.

Marv watched the patrol car turn the corner, then said, “There were no footsteps.”

I didn’t argue.

Because he was right.



After that, Marv changed.

Not drastically. Just enough.

He stopped speculating.

Started sounding… certain.

“He’s always in the hallway,” he said one night. “Standing there before the door even opens. Like he’s waiting. Like he already knows.”

I asked how he knew.

He told me he’d set up a wildlife cam across the street. Hidden. Motion-triggered. Pointed straight at the porch.

“Legal,” he said. “It’s my property. I can film my own view.”

But he wouldn’t go back himself.

He said the house had “seen him too much.” That it wouldn’t let him see it right anymore.

So we asked someone new.

Tammy LaRoux.

Nice woman. Walks her dog every day. Knew everyone’s name and birthday. Always up for being helpful.

We told her it was just a knock. A quick wellness check. She agreed without blinking.

We watched from my porch.

Tammy walked up. Smoothed her coat. Raised her hand.

And the door opened before she knocked.

She smiled. Spoke for a second. Nodded.

Then turned around and walked away.

Back at my place, she chuckled. “Sweet guy. A little off. Said he works nights. Sounded tired.”

Marv asked what he looked like.

She paused. “Tall, I think. Or thin. Standing back in the shadows. Couldn’t really make out his face. Voice was soft. Weirdly soft.”

Then she shrugged and went home.

Marv didn’t say a word.

He just went inside.



That night, he watched the footage.

I came over the next morning. He looked pale. Barely blinked.

“Watch,” he said.

We scrubbed through the video.

Tammy walked up.

Raised her hand.

The door opened.

And there, just inside the hallway, stood a figure.

Not approaching.

Not greeting.

Just there.

Tall. Pale. Bald. Too far back to be answering the door. Just… waiting.

Still.

And in the very next frame—gone.

Not blurry.

Just no longer present.

I leaned in. “That’s what’s answering the door?”

Marv’s voice was barely audible. “That’s what waits behind it.”



I don’t remember why I went.

I just remember doing it.

Marv had passed out, slumped over his notes. I left his porch. Crossed the street.

I didn’t knock.

Didn’t need to.

The door opened.

And it was standing there.

In the hallway.

Waiting.

Not moving. Not breathing.

And yet… alive.

I can’t describe what it felt like, standing there. I didn’t hear anything, but I knew what it wanted me to understand. Like it pressed something through the back of my eyes and into my spine.

It didn’t speak.

But it didn’t need to.

It showed me everything.

And I haven’t felt afraid since.



Marv came looking for me the next day.

I was already on his porch.

Drinking his beer.

Watching the street.

“You went over there?” he asked.

I nodded.

“You saw him?”

I nodded again.

“And?”

“He’s fine,” I said.

He just stared at me.

I smiled.

“He explained everything.”

Marv didn’t say anything. But I could feel his discomfort.

“He works nights,” I said. “Odd hours. That’s why the lights flicker. The footage? Motion blur. Nothing weird.”

I didn’t even think about what I was saying.

I didn’t have to.

The house had given me the answers.

They were always waiting.

“Let it go,” I told him. “You’ve been watching too long.”



That was the last time I saw Marv.

I don’t know where he went.

Or maybe I do.

Maybe he stepped inside, too.

Maybe the house kept him.

Like it kept me.



Weeks passed.

The gray house went dark.

Porch light never came on again.

But across the street—Marv’s old house—started changing.

The porch light flicks on every night now.

Not at 3:12. Not predictably.

Just… when it wants to.

Sometimes at dusk.

Sometimes at dawn.

The curtains never move.

But behind them, a soft glow pulses.

And sometimes, if you’re watching closely enough…

You’ll see someone standing in the window.

Tall.

Still.

Waiting.



People ask about him sometimes.

“Didn’t someone used to live there?”

And I always smile.

Because I know the truth.

Because I am the truth now.

And I say:

“Someone always lives there.”

We broke up before college because we were going to different places and didn’t want to try long distance. It was mutual and not messy—we just kind of faded out.

Anyway, now that I’m back, we ran into each other and started talking again. It felt weirdly easy. We grabbed coffee, started hanging out more, and it wasn’t long before old feelings came back. We kissed a couple times. He stayed over once (nothing happened beyond cuddling), and it felt like something real was building again.

Then a few nights ago, he told me he got someone pregnant. A girl he hooked up with a few months back. They’re not together, and from what he said, it wasn’t serious, just a one-time thing that happened when he was going through it emotionally. He said he’s going to be involved and wants to do right by the kid, but also made it clear he still wants to keep seeing where things go with us.

I didn’t say much in the moment. I told him thanks for being honest, but I kind of shut down. I left early and haven’t really responded to his texts since. I’m not trying to be dramatic, I just needed space. But a mutual friend told me I’m being cold and unfair, since it’s not like he cheated or did anything wrong. She also said I’m being weird about the fact that it was a woman, like I’m hung up on that more than the actual situation.

I don’t think that’s true. I’m not mad that he hooked up with a girl. I know he’s bi and I’ve never had an issue with that.

It kind of popped the little daydream I had in my head about us maybe getting back together and picking up where we left off. And now I feel selfish for even thinking that way.

So yeah. AITA for pulling away after he told me? I’m not trying to punish him or make him feel bad—I just feel really confused and didn’t know how to react.

I’ve recently made a lot of diet changes and included exercise in my daily routine. Prior to this, I ate whatever I wanted and drank iced coffee every day.

For reference, my height is 163 cm and my starting weight was 255 lbs.  
Two weeks into the diet and lifestyle changes, I've lost \~10 lbs. My current weight is 245.2 lbs.

Other info**:** I live in the Philippines, a tropical country where the weather is around 95–100°F

So far, here are the diet and lifestyle changes I’ve made:

* 1500-calorie meal plan for 5 days a week with tracked macros (carbs, fats, and protein, calories) all logged in the Lose It app. *Prior to this, I was eating more than 2,500 calories per day (I’m not really sure since I never tracked it.)*
* Quit caffeine and all sugary drinks. I drink around 2.5L of water everyday.
* Getting a minimum of 5k steps per day with the help of an indoor walking workout from growwithjo on YouTube. I try to aim for 6–8k on most days. My workouts usually last 40 mins - 1 hr. *Before this, I was only getting around 2k per day. I tried to take an outdoor walk yesterday around 4:45 PM — it was really hot and humid.*
* Trying to get more sleep. On weekdays, I get around 6 hours of sleep, and on weekends I try to get 8 hours.
* Fasting for at least 13 hours. I try to time my dinner around 6:15–6:30 PM and eat my breakfast at 7:30 AM.
* Accepting my diagnosis and TRYING MY BEST to think positively and not lose hope. I try to remember that as long as I keep trying to change my lifestyle and diet, I will get better. So far, I’ve been feeling more energetic and happier.

I honestly don’t know if what I’m doing is right or if it’ll help me reach a normal A1C by August. All I know is that I want to be healthier and have a better relationship with food. My goal is to be below 200 lbs before the end of the year.

I'm from a generation of people pleasers, I'm neurodivergent and I have been on the receiving end of rejection and bullying.

I don't want to be mean, but this women is so intent on us hanging out I'm getting anxious any time her name pops up.

We are both in our late 30s, met at the gym. She was intense, very chatty, amd kept interrupting my workout. But as someone who can be seen as a little odd myself, I tend to be empathetic and kind where others might immediately shut off.

We met for a coffee and went for a walk once and since then (8 months) I get messages most weeks asking to hang out. Doesn't sound too bad, right? But the way she reaches out makes me so stressed.

For example, if I post on my social media a photo of me out with my close group of friends, she is the first one to comment something like ""I wish I could be there too next time!"" - when she has never met these people and I've only hung out with her 1 on 1, once many months ago.

I received a really long message from her after she saw me out with another girl I'm friends with from the gym, that she is so lonely and she needs more support from the people in her life and I must really invite her next time (summarised).

I've been going through intense trauma therapy for months and I'm really in no position to be a support to a casual acquaintance from the gym. It wouldn't even occur to me to invite her as we don't have much in common (she's from a very wealthy background, me, not so much!)

I tried to be kind but firm in my reply that I am not someone she should be relying on for support, I have a close circle of friends that I dedicate my time to and I don't know her well enough to be that way with her. I also reaffirmed that I cannot invite her on every single outing I have, that isn't standard fare for building friendships.

She replied by pushing that we should become closer friends so that she CAN rely on me more and that I too could rely on her too. I never replied.

We sometimes see each other out at gym social events and she makes a beeline for me and I feel so drained after. She's constantly asking to meet up and I have said kindly that I don't have time. Hoping she'd get the message without me having to say I don't want to make time for her.

I'm writing this now because I'm too scared to open my Instagram once again as she's replied to another photo of me out with my friends asking to be invited along next time. The photo was of me and my husband meeting a friends girlfriend for the first time!? Why the heck would I invite a girl I barely know from the gym? It's so bizarre.

If I am harsh with her, I could really hurt her as she seems quite vulnerable. But I thinks she latched on to be because I showed empathy and listened to her where as the other girls from the gym avoided her from the off.

She is trying to force a friendship but I just cannot stand her energy and feel like I'd be drained all the time.

After 1 walk with her, I came home and fell asleep because my brain was fried listening to her.

She's lonely but I want to scream ""go away!"" Every time she pops up.

Advice welcome, but I think I already know what I need to do. Be harsh and tell her I'm not interested in being friends. Euuurggghh feel so mean.",1,1747639943.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

Im from Pennsylvania originally. I'm not sure if I am in need of legal advise in both PA and Hawaii but maybe you all can help me here. So my mother, she is a narcissist. She was always emotional and mentally abusive, so obviously there is no physical evidence of the abuse. I'm talking emotional incest, she's an alcoholic, neglect, being a general bully, pitting siblings against each other, adultery, bringing those men to the house when children were there.  She is also a mental health professional so she is really good at manipulating others around her and hiding abuse. I am her oldest (27F) I have 4 sisters and 1 brother. (Ages 4-24). Now the children in question that I would need help taking custody of for my dad are my two toddler sisters, ages 4&5. I am trying to help my father get custody of them, he has a hard time reading and writing so I'm just trying to help. He also doesn't know where to really start. 

Basically, my mom and family (siblings and dad) all moved from PA to Hawaii. My mother said it's bc it was her dream, in reality. She overstepped an ethical boundary as a mental health counselor by attempting to foster her client/patient's grandchildren. She was a mental health counselor that gave counseling. She loved saying she was a therapist but was not licensed (In the end the adoption failed, she did not get custody of those twins, but what happened is she got pregnant. Twice. As of May 2022 she, my young siblings and dad all moved out to Hawaii. Well in Hawaii she overstepped another ethical boundary when she began having an affair with her 28 year old client. He is a felon(beat up 3 cops) and an addict (I do not know of what, and that's not the bad thing but he is not someone I feel my baby sisters should be around. ) Apparently he also escaped said center he was at and my mother let him stay at their apartment. They were wasted from what my siblings said.  So not only is he literally my age, he was also her patient at the state hospital or center she worked at. She told my father. They are separated now. She kicked my 15 yo brother out the house so only my baby sister are there and my 17yo sister. But my 17 yo sister has been manipulated so much so that she is on my mother's side. I spent this week visiting in Hawaii for 17yo HS graduation. Their house is comparable to a crack house. It REEKS of dog piss and poop. Her bf leaves his dog tied to the door ALL day. They have a pitbull in a cage far too small in all day with no food or water. Their cats and dogs never have access or water or food.  My little sister even came up to me and said she feels like she didn't wipe right after going number 2 and she told my mom and she just told her ""you know how to use wipes"". I ended up cleaning her. And her undies were a mess. Dishes in the sink for weeks. I arrived Tuesday last week. I just left after being kicked out today and the dishes and house had not been cleaned since who knows when. Dead Roaches, both big and small. Moldy coffee and scrambled eggs on the counter. And my sisters are always having this wet cough that I suspect is from the ammonia in the house. I took videos and pictures of what I could. And I documented what my sisters told me. 

I'm so afraid for my family. How do I help my father gain custody of my baby sisters. My mother does not let him speak to them at all. Apart from this week bc of the graduation he has not seen them since they separated about 2 years ago. He is paying their insurance, rent, daycare. My mom and her bf just vape nicotine and drink (yet they go to AA, and he just ""graduated"" AA literally yesterday.)  Wtf do I do. Do I need a lawyer for PA and HAWAII? is there any legal standing here. God,  please just help me.  


TLDR: My narcissist abusive mother who is a mental health professional is neglecting my baby sisters and making them love in filth. I need help getting custody taken away from her and given to my father. ",4,1747639231.0,legaladvice,7,1.0,False

This was the last physical meet we had.

After this I contacted her asking if she wants to meet, she said yes, I got late to the plan and called her again to confirm she said yes but while I was on my way she just texted for me to not go there cuz it was late and she had early morning shift. I didn’t liked this at all. Flaky

Couple days later she contacted to meet me, we had a call and I told her come by certain  time or else we can’t meet cuz I had an early meeting, she didnt called or texted after that.

Later she again contacted me asking how I was nothing about meeting or anything….

Later I contacted her to meet, she said yes but didn’t confirmed fully, when it was closer to meeting time she called and told me she was getting off late from work (this happens cuz she has 12-16h shifts) and suggested some other day… I just said on call “Don’t give me excuses I just wanted to know if you want to meet me or not I got the answer” 

She later couple of days to meet, I was busy so said no and asked her day off… she said tomorrow, also acknowledged that she ditched last 2 times and she understands if I were pissed, I then asked if she wants to meet she said “I might have some plans and she will confirm” in my mind this was another flaky,maybe, second option plan and I was done with this…. She texted the off day if I was free but I have ghosted her since….. am I doing right?",0,1747638836.0,dating_advice,6,0.5,False

As a chef who spends long hours in hot kitchens, proper hydration isn't just important—it's essential. After cycling through countless disappointing water bottles, I finally tested the Owala FreeSip for several weeks, and I'm ready to share my verdict on this viral hydration vessel.

## The Game-Changing Design

The Owala FreeSip's claim to fame is its innovative dual-drinking system. You can either:
- Sip through the built-in straw when working (no need to tilt)
- Tilt back for larger gulps from the spout when you need serious hydration

This feature alone transformed my water consumption habits—I found myself naturally drinking more throughout service because it was so effortless.

The push-button opening mechanism feels substantial, and the carrying loop doubles as a locking mechanism—a thoughtful touch that prevents accidental spills in my knife bag. Perhaps most impressive is the protective cover that keeps the mouthpiece clean—crucial in kitchen environments.

## Performance That Delivers

After putting this bottle through the restaurant gauntlet, here's what impressed me:

**Insulation**: The double-wall vacuum seal is no joke. I've left this bottle in my hot car during summer service, and returned to find ice cubes still intact 8+ hours later.

**Leak-Proof Promise**: True to its word, I've stored this alongside kitchen notes and electronics without a single drop escaping.

**Drinking Experience**: The straw delivers perfect flow without that vacuum-struggle many bottles have. The spout option gives you a generous gulp when needed between busy tickets.

**Cleaning**: While the lid has several components requiring attention, it comes apart intuitively for thorough cleaning—essential for food safety standards.

## Specifications at a Glance

| Feature | Details |
|:--------|:--------|
| Capacity | 24oz/32oz options |
| Material | 18/8 Stainless Steel, BPA-free plastic |
| Insulation | Double-wall vacuum (cold retention: 24hrs) |
| Weight | 14.4oz (empty) |
| Special Features | FreeSip dual-drinking design, carrying loop, locking mechanism |
| Dishwasher Safe | Lid: top rack only; Body: handwashing recommended |
| Price Range | $29.99-$34.99 |

## The Good & The Less Good

### Pros:
* Exceptional temperature retention (crucial during long services)
* Truly leak-proof design
* Versatile drinking options adapt to different situations
* Protective cover keeps mouthpiece sanitary
* Durable construction stands up to kitchen abuse
* Stylish enough to bring tableside if needed

### Cons:
* Multiple lid components mean more thorough cleaning required
* Makes gurgling sounds when nearly empty
* Heavier than basic bottles when filled
* Not for hot beverages (I still need my separate coffee thermos)
* Wider base doesn't fit in some vehicle cup holders

## Who Needs This Bottle?

**Kitchen Newbies**: The intuitive design makes hydration easy, though the price point might be high for beginners.

**Line Cooks & Chefs**: The dual-drinking system is perfect for busy environments where you need options—quick sips while plating or bigger gulps during breaks.

**Health-Conscious Culinary Pros**: If you're serious about hydration and tired of lukewarm water, this solves both problems elegantly.

## Final Verdict

After extensive testing in demanding kitchen environments, the Owala FreeSip has earned its permanent place on my station. The combination of practical features, impressive insulation, and thoughtful design makes staying hydrated through long shifts actually enjoyable rather than another chore.

Is it worth the $30-35 investment? For anyone spending long hours on their feet in hot environments, absolutely. I've wasted more money on cheaper bottles that leaked, couldn't keep water cold, or were frustrating to drink from. The Owala does exactly what it promises, and does it exceptionally well.

# Introduction to Neutral Color Palettes

Neutral color palettes hold a significant place in the realm of interior design. Renowned [**Interior designers in Bhopal**](https://www.home2decor.com/interior-designers-in-bhopal/)

 frequently advocate for these tones due to their impressive versatility and timeless appeal. Neutral colors, which typically encompass shades of white, beige, gray, and taupe, serve as a foundational element in various design styles, ranging from contemporary minimalism to classic designs. Their understated elegance allows them to complement bold accent colors and patterns without overwhelming a space.

The effective use of neutral tones can transform a room into a serene sanctuary, fostering a harmonious environment that promotes relaxation and tranquility. Luxury interior designers in Bhopal often utilize these palettes to create inviting spaces that cater to the aesthetics of their clients while imparting a sense of calmness. Neutral hues act as a blank canvas, enabling [**interior designers in Bhopal for home**](https://www.home2decor.com/interior-designers-in-bhopal/)

 projects to blend different materials, textures, and furnishings seamlessly while maintaining a cohesive look.

Another key advantage of neutral color palettes is their timelessness. Trends may come and go, but the elegance of neutral colors consistently endures, making them a preferred choice among the best interior designers in Bhopal. By utilizing neutral tones, designers can create rooms that evolve with changing styles, minimizing the need for frequent overhauls. Additionally, homeowners often appreciate the ability to decorate with various accents and accessories, as neutral backgrounds can accommodate diverse themes and seasonal décor shifts.

In pursuit of enhancing interiors, the top 10 interior designers in Bhopal recognize that the artistry of neutral palettes lies in their ability to adapt and coexist with a myriad of artistic expressions. From sleek modern aesthetics to cozy traditional spaces, neutral shades lay the groundwork for stunning designs that stand the test of time.

# What are Neutral Colors?

https://preview.redd.it/7qynj77juo1f1.jpg?width=2187&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=121e981d87fcca11342bad125dc324a0a038bbf3

Neutral colors play a vital role in interior design, offering versatility and a sense of balance. These hues are often seen as the foundation of any color scheme, primarily because they tend not to overwhelm a space. Neutral colors encompass a diverse range, which includes shades of white, gray, beige, taupe, and even various browns. Each class of neutral can be categorized further into warm, cool, and true neutrals, making them adaptable for diverse design preferences.

Warm neutrals, typically featuring undertones of yellow or red, create a cozy atmosphere. These shades, such as creamy whites and warm taupes, often elicit a sense of tranquility and comfort. In contrast, cool neutrals, which may include silvery grays and soft blues, impart a calming ambiance that is often utilized in modern spaces. True neutrals, devoid of any warm or cool undertones, embody shades like pure whites and standard grays, serving as a canvas for bolder accent colors.

The psychological effects of neutral colors contribute significantly to their popularity among interior designers in Bhopal. These hues have the remarkable ability to make spaces feel larger and more open while evoking feelings of serenity and composure. For this reason, many of the best interior designers in Bhopal often advocate incorporating neutral shades into home designs, particularly in living areas and bedrooms where relaxation is paramount.

Common associations linked with neutral colors include sophistication and timelessness, traits that align perfectly with the visions presented by famous interior designers in Bhopal. The subtlety of neutrals allows for seamless integration with various decor styles, enhancing the overall visual appeal without overshadowing other design elements. Whether chosen for their aesthetic charm or calming influence, neutral colors remain a staple choice in the palettes of luxury interior designers in Bhopal.

# The Importance of Choosing the Right Palette

https://preview.redd.it/5j7wdshkuo1f1.jpg?width=2187&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f534123770d97f98e335957806cad9310dac13be

Selecting the appropriate neutral color palette is a fundamental aspect of interior design, as it significantly influences the overall ambiance and functionality of a space. Interior designers in Bhopal emphasize that understanding the interplay between color, light, and room dimensions is essential for creating a cohesive environment. Neutral colors, by their nature, are versatile and can evoke a range of emotions or styles when combined with the right materials and furnishings.

One of the first factors to consider when choosing a neutral palette is the lighting in the room. Natural light can shift the perception of colors throughout the day; for instance, warm tones may appear more vibrant in direct sunlight while cooler tones are accentuated in shaded areas. Consequently, it is crucial to observe how light interacts with your selected colors at different times. Interior designers in Bhopal often recommend testing paint samples on walls to evaluate color dynamics in various lighting conditions before finalizing choices.

Additionally, the size of the room plays a vital role in palette selection. Lighter shades tend to expand a space visually, making them suitable for smaller rooms, while darker neutral colors can create intimacy and warmth in larger areas. Thus, the balance of light and space must be carefully examined to achieve the desired effect. For specific applications such as homes, it is advisable to consult with some of the [**best interior designers in Bhopal**](https://www.home2decor.com/interior-designers-in-bhopal/)

 who can provide insights tailored to individual spaces.

The intended use of the room cannot be overlooked either. For example, spaces meant for relaxation should favor calming tones, while areas designated for social gatherings may benefit from warmer hues. By understanding these elements, one can strategically implement neutral color palettes to enhance the intended atmosphere of each space, ensuring an inviting and harmonious environment.

# The First Palette: Classic Warm Neutrals

https://preview.redd.it/044org4muo1f1.jpg?width=2187&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e1dcb6bd86a711061e358ba962ed7af9238c2869

Classic warm neutrals have long held a prominent place in the repertoire of interior designers in Bhopal. Colors such as beige, ivory, and taupe are celebrated for their timeless appeal, effectively fostering a calming atmosphere. These hues possess an innate ability to create cozy, inviting spaces that enhance the feel of any room. By employing warm neutrals, one can achieve an understated elegance that complements various design styles, whether traditional or contemporary.

Incorporating classic warm neutrals into different areas of the home can be accomplished with ease. For instance, in living rooms, using an ivory paint on the walls can create a bright and airy feeling, especially when complemented with warm beige furniture pieces. Accent pillows or throws in softer shades can amplify the cozy ambiance. Meanwhile, wooden elements in natural finishes can enhance the warmth of the palette further, creating a harmonious balance.

In the kitchen, warm neutrals can be elegantly introduced through cabinetry and countertop materials. Satin finishes on beige cabinetry add a touch of sophistication, while ivory tiles can be used for backsplashes to reflect light, making the space feel open and inviting. For a more luxurious touch, consider integrating textures through nubby fabrics or woven baskets that add depth without overpowering the serene color scheme.

Bedrooms can greatly benefit from warm neutrals as well, where the goal is often to create a soothing retreat. A soft taupe wall paired with white linens and plush beige accents can evoke relaxation and comfort. Notably, luxury interior designers in Bhopal often recommend layering these colors in different materials, such as linens, rugs, and wall coverings, to maintain a balanced yet visually dynamic environment.

Ultimately, this palette offers versatility and timelessness, making it a favorite among the best interior designers in Bhopal for creating serene living spaces. The harmonious interplay of classic warm neutrals fosters an atmosphere that is both welcoming and enduring, exemplifying the artistry of interior design.

# The Second Palette: Cool Grey Tones

https://preview.redd.it/u1d2ht6nuo1f1.jpg?width=2187&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5e24e7195ef3aef3e449cb6b86f6aa035e05f4bc

Cool grey tones have emerged as a quintessential choice among interior designers in Bhopal, celebrated for their modern and sophisticated ambiance. This color palette transcends trends, establishing itself as a staple for creating serene and elegant spaces. The versatility of cool greys allows them to seamlessly blend into both contemporary and traditional settings, appealing to a wide range of design preferences.

These shades serve as a perfect backdrop, setting the stage for bold accents and captivating artwork. For instance, in a modern living room, cool grey walls can enhance vibrant cushions or a striking abstract painting, allowing these elements to stand out without overwhelming the overall aesthetic. Similarly, in traditional settings, a cool grey tone can complement rich wood finishes and antique furnishings, creating a harmonious balance that upholds the charm of heritage design.

Moreover, cool greys can be utilized in various applications, from the main living areas to private spaces like bedrooms and studies. In a bedroom, a soft cool grey can evoke tranquility, providing an inviting retreat from the world. Meanwhile, renowned interior designers in Bhopal might incorporate varying shades of grey to create depth and interest, ensuring that the space feels dynamic yet cohesive.

# The Third Palette: Earthy Browns and Taupes

https://preview.redd.it/9kj7dd7ouo1f1.jpg?width=2187&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=67119a7d6e0fa91ba6d6f9ff56f6cd7b98efbad9

Earthy brown and taupe tones represent a sophisticated choice for those looking to create a warm and inviting atmosphere in their living spaces. These colors offer a grounding effect, enhancing the connection to nature and fostering a sense of tranquillity. Interior designers in Bhopal frequently incorporate earthy palettes into their projects, as they resonate well with Indian aesthetics, often reflecting the natural landscapes surrounding us.

The versatility of brown and taupe enables them to work harmoniously with a variety of design styles, from rustic to contemporary. By choosing these hues, one can create a serene environment, which can be particularly beneficial in urban residences. For instance, when combined with natural materials, like wood or stone, these colors can evoke feelings of warmth and comfort, making them ideal for living rooms or bedrooms. Such applications are frequently seen among the best interior designers in Bhopal, who understand the balance between aesthetics and functionality.

Practical examples of this palette include using taupe for wall paint, which can serve as a neutral backdrop perfect for showcasing art or other design elements. Pairing taupe walls with earthy brown furniture—such as a leather sofa or a reclaimed wood coffee table—can create an inviting focal point in the room. For homeowners interested in organic-inspired designs, accessories like terracotta pots or woven textiles in complementary shades can enhance the overall effect. Ultimately, earthy browns and taupes not only provide beauty but also serve to connect inhabitants with the larger natural world, making them a popular selection among luxury interior designers in Bhopal.

# The Fourth Palette: Soft Whites and Creams

https://preview.redd.it/m2nmfn5puo1f1.jpg?width=2187&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c2bad924afc4b8930be56e927a5e2786b33f681b

Soft whites and creams are timeless shades that interior designers often favor for their ability to evoke a sense of purity and simplicity. These colors can transform spaces, creating an airy and spacious atmosphere, which is particularly beneficial for homes in Bhopal where maximizing natural light is essential. By incorporating soft whites and creams, one can achieve a serene environment that promotes tranquility and comfort.

One of the key advantages of using soft whites and creams is their versatility. They can be effectively layered with various textures, allowing for a depth that prevents the space from feeling flat or monotonous. For instance, pairing a cream-colored sofa with soft linen pillows not only adds comfort but also introduces subtle sophistication. Similarly, textured rugs in soft shades can enhance the overall aesthetic while still adhering to a neutral palette.

To exemplify the effectiveness of this palette, consider a living room designed by some of the most renowned interior designers in Bhopal, where soft white walls provide a splendid backdrop for cream-colored furnishings. The use of hardwood flooring in a warm tone adds contrast without overwhelming the space. Accessories such as light curtains and woven baskets can further enrich the room’s design, making it feel layered and inviting.

In kitchens, soft whites and creams can present a clean and modern look. Cabinets painted in a soft white not only reflect light but also create a sense of openness. Accentuating these cabinets with brass hardware adds a touch of elegance, capturing the essence of [**luxury interior designers in Bhopal**](https://www.home2decor.com/interior-designers-in-bhopal/)

. By thoughtfully combining elements, homeowners can achieve a timeless appeal with this palette that resonates well with both contemporary and classic styles.

# The Fifth Palette: Dusty Pastels as Neutrals

https://preview.redd.it/na4ax6tpuo1f1.jpg?width=2187&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=859b8040560561e056c4ff2f9ef46eeb3971044f

Dusty pastels have emerged as a favored choice among renowned interior designers in Bhopal, transcending traditional color schemes with their subtlety and elegance. These muted tones, which consist of soft versions of colors like lavender, mint green, and blush pink, serve as effective neutrals that can create a serene atmosphere in any interior space. By incorporating dusty pastels, professionals are able to balance bright accents while maintaining a sophisticated look.

In children's rooms, dusty pastels are particularly advantageous, allowing for a calming environment that encourages relaxation and creativity. For instance, bedrooms adorned with soft lavender and gentle mint can provide a nurturing backdrop for children’s growth and play. These colors promote an air of tranquility, which is essential for a peaceful night's sleep while still offering playful aesthetics that appeal to young minds.

Additionally, dusty pastels find their place in modern minimalist designs, where the goal is to achieve a clutter-free and harmonious space. Here, interior designers in Bhopal leverage dusty pastel colors to soften stark, white spaces without overwhelming them. A room painted in pale grey with accents of dusty peach, for instance, exudes both warmth and modernity, making the area feel welcoming yet stylish. This blend of simplicity and gentle color enhances the beauty of minimalist furniture and decor, catering to those searching for a refined elegance.

As a result, dusty pastels are among the top choices for those seeking versatility in their color palette.

# Practical Tips for Working with Neutral Palettes

https://preview.redd.it/m9rcy7oquo1f1.jpg?width=2187&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=41aaecd6ee155b7628b904f4ed8503898848a6d6

When working with neutral color palettes, it is essential to understand how to effectively create an atmosphere that embodies both warmth and sophistication. Interior designers in Bhopal often emphasize the importance of selecting complementary furnishings to enhance the neutral backdrop. Opt for furniture pieces that incorporate subtle tones found within your chosen palette. For instance, if you have chosen soft greys and beiges, consider selecting brown or muted wooden furniture to add warmth and depth.

In addition to complementary furnishings, introducing varied textures can significantly elevate the overall aesthetic of your space. [**Famous interior designers in Bhopal**](https://www.home2decor.com/interior-designers-in-bhopal/) commonly recommend combining materials such as linen, velvet, and leather to create a rich and inviting environment. Textiles such as cushions, curtains, and throws can offer not only comfort but also visual interest, allowing your neutral palette to thrive without appearing bland.

Accessorizing is another critical aspect to consider when implementing neutral color schemes. It is advisable to select decor items that include pops of color or distinctive patterns to bring life to the serene surroundings. When accessorizing, focus on creating balance; for instance, using bold artwork or vibrant plants can serve as focal points against an otherwise understated background. Interior designers in Bhopal for home decor often suggest using a limited number of accessories for a clean look, ensuring that essentials like vases or sculptures enhance rather than overpower the neutral tones.

Please tell me what to do.,"So I’ve been with my girlfriend for ten years. We have a kid together, he’s three now. I thought things were solid. We’ve got a house, we’ve got routines, we know each other inside and out. I mean I literally see this woman every day. She knows how I take my coffee. I know the sound of her coming up the stairs. This wasn’t some flaky situationship. This was real life.

She’s always talked about getting married, sure. She used to show me Pinterest stuff or tag me in wedding things on Instagram. I’d laugh it off or be like, “yeah eventually.” We’ve got a kid already, we live together, what exactly does a wedding change at this point? It’s all just labels. Paperwork. Expensive photos. I figured she got that.

We’ve been to a lot of weddings lately. She’d get weirdly quiet at them or emotional or whatever. I’d ask if she was alright and she’d say “fine” and then act mad when I didn’t magically know what was wrong. So that was fun.

Then there was this whole thing about how she “didn’t want to be just a girlfriend at parent-teacher meetings.” Like… who cares? Is the teacher gonna treat her differently because she’s not a wife? We both show up. I sit there. I nod. I say something nice about the art project. Like, isn’t that enough?

Then all of a sudden she’s on every school committee. Every week there’s some meeting or some event. Always talking about this dad she’s “organizing stuff with.” She says his name more than mine at this point. When I asked what was going on she hit me with, “He actually listens to me.”

Like okay? What am I supposed to say to that? I didn’t even know she felt not-listened-to. She never said anything directly. Just hinted and hinted and expected me to pick up on it like I’m a mind reader.

So I said I’d propose. I panicked a bit, not gonna lie. Started looking up rings and venues and stuff, trying to get it right. She just stared at me. No excitement. No tears. Just this dead look like I’d missed the point entirely.

And then tonight she tells me she’s going to start dating. Like I’m supposed to just be cool with that? After ten years and a kid? She says she told me what she needed and I ignored it. That she waited and waited and eventually gave up.

But from my side it just feels like she decided I wasn’t moving fast enough and now I’m being punished for it. She didn’t give me a deadline. She didn’t say “do this by X time or I’m gone.” She just let it build up and now suddenly I’m the bad guy?

I don’t know what I’m supposed to do now. I offered the proposal. I said I’d step up. I’m here. I’m trying. And it’s like none of that matters now.

I honestly feel blindsided. She was always here. We had a life. Yeah maybe I dragged my feet a little, but who doesn’t? Now she’s talking like it’s already over and she’s just informing me after the fact.

I was stunned. “It’s yours.”

“We’ve been married for seven years and never had a child. I go on business trip for two months, and suddenly you’re expecting a child? Do you think I am a fool?”

His words chilled me to the core.

The child was already two months old, so the timing should make sense to him.

Off to the side, his mother Aveline sneered coldly. “No wonder why you’re always out late at night. So that’s where you’ve been—seeing another man.”

The truth was, I had been working overtime most nights. Their accusations pushed me to tears.

In the end, I told him, “If you don’t believe me, then let’s go to the pack doctor and do a paternity test.”

To my surprise, Dante agreed without hesitation.

I was deeply disappointed. The moment we finished the test that day, I packed up and went back to my parents’ old pack.

The results would take three days. Dante and I agreed to meet at the pack doctor’s office when they were ready.

If the child turned out to be his, he would give me a public apology.

If not, he’d sever our mate bond, and I’d leave with nothing. No money, no title.

During those three days, Dante didn’t contact me even once.

Furious and shattered, I told my mom that once we got the results, I’d terminate the pregnancy, reject him, serve the mate bond, and leave him for good.

My mom tried to calm me down. She told me to give him another chance.

“Dante loves you like his life. You’ve been together so long, but couldn’t get a kid, and he never complained about it. Now you’re suddenly carrying a child—it’s normal for him to be suspicious.”

“Just wait. When the results come out, he’s going to hit himself for ever doubting you.”

She wasn’t wrong. Dante did have a temper, but he truly loved me.

So I decided to listen to her and give him another chance.

But on the day we were supposed to meet, I overslept.

Just as I was about to head out, the doorbell rang.

I opened the door and saw Dante standing there.

I thought he had come to pick me up after realizing his mistake.

“Dante, you saw the results, right? I never—”

Before I could finish, he hit me in the face.

He hit me so hard that the blow made my vision go black. Blood filled my mouth, and a ringing buzzed in my ears.

I looked up at him, disbelief written all over my face.

“Dante, are you out of your mind?!”

—Smack.

Another slap.

I stumbled back a few steps and fell to the floor, hitting the table behind me.

With a clatter, everything on the table scattered to the ground.

The noise brought my mom rushing out from the bedroom. She screamed and hurried to help me up.

“Dante, how dare you hit her?!”

“She deserves it.” Dante’s eyes were bloodshot as he grabbed a tissue box from the coffee table and hurled it at me. “Renna, you cheated on me. I’m going to beat you to death, you filthy woman.”

I grabbed my mom and ducked out of the way just as the tissue box flew past us.

What was he saying?

Did that mean the results said the child wasn’t his?

I cried out, “I’ve never been with anyone else. There must be a mistake!”

“Mistake?” Dante growled through gritted teeth as he pulled out his phone and threw it at me. “The evidence is clear. There’s no mistake.”

**Chapter 2**

I picked up Dante’s phone and looked at the screen.

It showed a chat between him and Alpha Xander’s Luna, Sienna.

Xander was Dante’s friend and the Alpha of the neighboring pack.

I’d met Sienna a few times at the Alpha Ball, so we could be considered acquaintances.

In the messages, Sienna told Dante that I was having an affair with Xander.

At first, Dante didn’t believe her until she sent a photo.

It was a photo of a pair of lacy panties.

They looked familiar. I’d worn them the night before Dante left on his last trip.

Thinking it might be a misunderstanding, I quickly explained, “Dante, those aren’t mine.”

But hearing that only made him angrier.

He stormed over, snatched the phone from my hand, tapped the screen a couple of times, then grabbed my hair and shoved the phone right in front of my eyes.

“Take a good look. If they’re not yours, then whose are they?”

On the screen was another photo. This time, one side of the panties had the words “Dante only” embroidered on them.

My mind went blank, and my face turned pale.

“T-That’s impossible. I threw them away after showing them to you. How could they possibly...”

Then I remembered—Dante’s mother, Aveline, had a strange habit of wearing my clothes without permission.

Once, I came home early and found her standing topless in front of my closet, picking through my wardrobe.

When I asked her about it, she claimed she’d walked into the wrong room.

After she left, I noticed one of my lace panties on the floor.

Could it have been Aveline who wore them?

I looked up at Dante and said, “I know who wore them—it was your mother.”

“How dare you!” Dante exploded and hit me hard in the leg. “Of all people, you choose to slander my mom? Why would she wear your underwear at her age?”

“And she’s the former Luna! Show some respect!”

My legs gave out and I dropped to the floor.

He raised his hand and hit me—again and again.

My mother panicked and rushed over, grabbing his arm. “Dante, please stop! This has to be a misunderstanding. Let’s sit down and talk it through, please!”

“Get out of my face!” Dante shoved her aside without hesitation.

She fell to the floor.

“Mom!” I cried out, glaring at him. “Dante, you crazy man! My mom has a back injury. If you hurt her, my dad won’t let you off.”

My father was a werewolf police. Even though Alphas were powerful, they were still subject to werewolf law.

Dante knew this—but he had already lost all control.

“Your mom gave birth to a filthy woman like you. She must be a filthy woman herself. Maybe your dad should be thanking me for teaching her a lesson!”

By now, a crowd had gathered outside our door.

“What’s going on?”

“Sounds like Dominic’s daughter cheated on her mate.”

“That can’t be. Dominic’s such an upright guy, how could he have raised a daughter like this?”

As the gossip grew louder, one man finally couldn’t take it anymore and stepped forward.

“Alpha, calm down. Luna’s carrying a child. Hitting a woman, especially one carrying a child, is beyond cruel.”

Dante turned and glared at him. “This isn’t your business. Let’s see how calm you are when your wife cheats on you.”

After yelling at him, Dante faced the crowd and shouted, “This is my private business. Even if the werewolf police come, at worst it’s domestic violence. But if anyone dares to meddle or call the cops—once I’m done here, I’ll pay you a visit.”

He let out a low growl, his Alpha aura radiating from his entire body.

At those words, the crowd melted away. Nobody wanted to get involved in this mess.

“Renna, you cheat on me and you even expect me to raise that guy’s child? Do you think I’m a fool?”

His eyes burned into my body.

I’d never seen Dante like this—a feral beast, raw murder in his gaze.

Instinctively, I covered my stomach and softened my voice.

“Honey, I swear I didn’t cheat. If you don’t believe me, call Xander. Ask him who really brought those panties into his bed.”

He sneered. “Xander? You call him that so sweet, not even ‘Alpha Xander.’ You think he’s coming to save you? Dream about it. Luna Sienna’s already got a dozen men waiting for him. He’s got bigger fish to fry.”

Dante’s eyes shifted to the wall, where my father had hung his treasured baseball bat. He took it down and gripped in his hand.

“When exactly did you start doing it with Xander?” he asked coldly.

“I didn’t,” I replied, shaking my head.

“Still lying, huh?”

He raised the baseball bat.

I screamed and shut my eyes.

The baseball bat cracked against something—but I didn’t feel any pain.

I opened my eyes.

This was pretty unexpected as she hadn’t mentioned anything about being in a relationship before, but still showed signs of being interested in me. 

Maybe she just has an outgoing personality and I was just overthinking? Honestly not too sure. Just wondering how to navigate things moving forward to avoid any awkwardness at work when I see her next, as I really enjoy being around her and look forward to going to work whenever she is around. Not gonna lie, it’s painful knowing she doesn’t have the same feelings that I do but I don’t think it’s right to force feelings that aren’t there organically.

Once my conscience finally caught up with me, I decided, just for funsies, to time how long it would *actually* take to reply to those emails that had been haunting my inbox (AKA the main motivation for my procrastination).

Result?

Three minutes per email.

There’s nothing like realizing you’ve spent hours avoiding something that literally takes less time than making a cup of coffee.

**Anyway, here are three inbox management tips I swear by to stop emails from taking over my life:**

**✉️ Self-imposed deadlines:** I set a timer for a maximum of 5 minutes per reply and aim to clear my inbox the same day.

If a reply needs more thought or work, I simply move it to my to-do list.

**✉️ Inbox ≠ To-do list:** If an email contains a task, I move it into Trello or Asana.

It’s super important for me to move all action steps into a task manager, otherwise I’m going to lose them in the flood of all the conversations.

**✉️ Use labels:** Set up simple labels to keep my email chaos under control.

One of my favorites is *""Waiting for reply""* that reminds me which conversations are still floating in the void.

Once a week, I do a quick review and give those conversations a little nudge if needed.",1,1747638109.0,lisaspeaks,0,1.0,False

Mondays... We've All Been There! 😴  
Ah, Monday. That familiar feeling of the weekend slipping away and the weight of the week looming. We get it! It's okay to feel a little draggy after a good weekend.  
But here's the thing: you've got this! 💪 You just spent a couple of days doing things you love, recharging your batteries, and filling your cup. Tap into that positive energy!  
Think of it like this: the weekend was like a supercharged battery pack for your soul. Now, let's use that power to tackle the week! 🚀  
Here are a few tips to get you started:  
\* Start small: Don't try to conquer the whole week at once. Break down your tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks.  
\* Reward yourself: Plan a small reward for getting through the day. It could be anything from a cup of coffee to a few minutes of meditation.  
\* Remember your weekend wins: Take a moment to reflect on the positive experiences you had over the weekend. Let those good vibes fuel your Monday.  
You've got this! Let's make this Monday a productive and awesome one. ✨",1,1747638105.0,3AMALONE,0,1.0,False

i drink mainly lungo or Americano and my wife drinks Cappuccino.  
we are not really heavy coffee drinkers but i think we average 4 cups a day and on the weekend maybe 6-8.

\- is there a lot of quality difference between lets say Sage/Delonghi/profitec/lelit/ascaso etc?  
\- how big is the quality difference between a Jura (i think best of the full automatic) and a piston machine if you dont really know what your doing?

Want me to let him know?""","Chapter 1  
  
""Freya, Mr. Whitemore signed off on your resignation papers, but he didn't notice it was you leaving. Want me to let him know?"" The HR director's voice came through the phone, concern evident.  
  
Freya's eyes lowered as she replied softly, ""No need. Just leave it as is.""  
  
""But you've been his right hand for four years! He values you more than anyone and totally depends on you. Are you absolutely sure about quitting?""  
  
HR was practically begging, but Freya just offered a small smile.  
  
""Nobody's irreplaceable in this world. My parents aren't doing well, and I need to head back home to settle down. Since Mr. Whitemore approved it, I'll handle the transition. I'll be gone in a month. Thanks for checking.""  
  
After hanging up, Freya went back to sorting through her things. She'd lived in this penthouse for three years. Not too much stuff, not too little—just keeping essentials and tossing the rest.  
  
As the room emptied, she felt momentarily disoriented, memories washing over her like waves.  
  
Eight years ago, Freya—a small-town girl from a modest family—got into Harvard and became best friends with New York heiress Elena Whitemore.  
  
Despite their completely different backgrounds, they clicked instantly—attending lectures together, grabbing lunch, hitting the shops—practically joined at the hip every day.  
  
Gradually, Elena brought Freya into her world, introduced her to family, and unwittingly, Freya fell hard for Elena's brother, Jasper. But she buried those feelings deep, never breathing a word to anyone.  
  
After graduation, Elena took off to study in Paris. Freya stayed in New York, landed a job as Jasper's assistant—all to be near him.  
  
Then came that night when someone slipped something into Jasper's drink. Freya was about to call 911 when he pinned her against the wall, his control gone as his mouth claimed hers.  
  
After a night together, she woke to find him by the window, his sharp profile haloed in cigarette smoke, brooding and distant.  
  
Hearing her stir, he turned. ""You're into me, aren't you?""  
  
Freya instinctively wanted to deny it, but he continued, his face expressionless.  
  
""You blush whenever I walk in. You know all my likes and dislikes. You jumped at becoming my assistant right after graduation...""  
  
""Don't tell me that's all coincidence.""  
  
His words left her face burning, from embarrassment or guilt, she wasn't sure which.  
  
In the heavy silence, he suddenly handed her a card.  
  
""Last night shouldn't have happened. I'm in love with someone else and can't return your feelings or take responsibility. Elena mentioned you come from a modest background—there's enough money on this card to set you up for life. Let's both forget this ever happened.""  
  
Freya was stunned. Then she remembered he'd repeatedly called out a name in bed: Mia. Mia Carter.  
  
From Elena, Freya knew Mia was Jasper's unforgettable first love. He was so hung up on her that even after she dumped him and moved abroad, collecting a string of rumored boyfriends, he insisted on waiting for her return.  
  
Freya recalled Elena's eye-roll: ""The Whitemores are known for being cold fish. How did my brother turn into such a hopeless romantic? Waiting all these years, saying everyone else would be 'settling' because he refuses to settle.""  
  
Feeling this in her bones, Freya suddenly found her courage and called after Jasper as he headed for the door.  
  
""I don't want your money. I just want a chance. Please, just try being with me. If she never comes back or... if she does return but you still can't move on, I'll walk away. I promise.""  
  
Faced with her lovesick gaze, Jasper paused for a beat before muttering, ""Whatever,"" and walking out.  
  
From that day forward, Freya was his assistant by day and his lover by night. They left their mark in his office, his Maybach, against the windows of his penthouse. Four years passed with no one knowing about their arrangement, and she told herself she was happy.  
  
Until his birthday a few days ago. Freya had planned several surprises to celebrate. But as midnight approached, instead of Jasper, she got a notification from his social media—an account he'd never used before.  
  
""Best birthday gift? Getting back what I lost.""  
  
The forever-silent Jasper Whitemore had posted a photo of himself kissing Mia Carter beneath exploding fireworks.  
  
Seeing this, the blood drained from Freya's face, her chest tightening. With one last desperate hope, she called him.  
  
Mia answered. After saying ""hello"" several times to silence, she called out: ""Jasper, who's this Freya Kingsley calling you and not saying anything?""  
  
A moment later, his deep, cool voice came through the speaker: ""Nobody important. Ignore it. Come back to bed, babe.""  
  
In that moment, Freya knew her exit cue had arrived.  
  
She packed her things, ready to leave, when she ran into Jasper at the door. Since they'd been sleeping together regularly, Freya had been staying at his place for convenience—but now, she couldn't stay another night.  
  
Seeing her with her bags, his eyes narrowed slightly, but he made no move to stop her. ""Found a place?""  
  
""Yeah, my old apartment. Talked to the landlord—just for a month.""  
  
At this, Jasper frowned. ""A month? What for?""  
  
Freya started to explain, but he seemed to lose interest, merely saying, ""I'll drive you.""  
  
She tried to refuse, but he insisted.  
  
""It's dumping snow out there, and it's late. If anything happened to you, Elena would kill me.""  
  
Freya reluctantly got into his car. Once, they'd been intimate countless times in this vehicle, but now she barely recognized it. The interior was plastered with cute plushies, Hello Kitty seat covers, and snacks everywhere...  
  
She could hardly imagine this serious, standoffish man transforming his car into something so cutesy.  
  
Noticing her stare, Jasper offered a brief explanation: ""Mia's into this stuff.""  
  
Freya got his meaning and stayed quiet for a long while before responding softly.  
  
""You finally got her back. I'm happy for you, Mr. Whitemore.""  
  
Jasper hadn't expected that response. His eyes darkened, and he said nothing more.  
  
Halfway to her place, Mia called, wanting to build a snowman with him. He pulled over, clearly eager to go to her, but hesitated when he glanced at Freya.  
  
Understanding his dilemma, Freya opened the door. ""I'll grab a Uber from here, Mr. Whitemore.""  
  
He nodded and got out to help with her stuff. Her hands slipped, and the box crashed to the ground. As he bent down, the streetlight illuminated its spilled contents, freezing him in place.  
  
Love letters addressed to him but never sent, candid photos she'd secretly taken, things he'd tossed that she'd rescued and treasured...  
  
Freya's heart hammered as she scrambled to gather everything.  
  
""Sorry about that.""  
  
Without a word, Jasper got back in his car and sped away.  
  
Freya waited in the snow for ages but couldn't get a ride. Trying to lug her box home, she was hit by an electric scooter.  
  
The collision left a nasty gash on her calf, blood staining the snow. Watching the hit-and-run driver disappear, she gasped with pain, lying in the snow for what felt like forever.  
  
When she could finally move, she limped through the snow for four hours before reaching her apartment.  
  
After patching up her wound, she checked her phone to find a message from Jasper, sent after he'd left:  
  
\[Stop being so obsessed with one guy. There are plenty of fish in the sea. Don't hang all your hopes on me.\]  
  
Freya stared at this message for a very long time.  
  
At dawn, she went downstairs, set fire to the box, and burned everything inside it. The love that had burned fiercely in her heart for eight years turned to ashes alongside those mementos.  
  
Jasper Whitemore, I'll grant your wish.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
After a quiet weekend, Monday morning rolled around, and Freya arrived at work on schedule.  
  
She handled her usual tasks, including notifying Jasper about his upcoming meeting. Approaching his office, she glanced through the partially open door and stopped cold.  
  
Mia was sitting in Jasper's lap, feeding him the other half of her cookie. The famously germaphobic CEO actually ate it with a smile, then gently kissed her fingertips.  
  
""You were talking about craving these yesterday, so I stood in line for three hours this morning. Worth it?"" His voice had a tenderness Freya had never heard before.  
  
""Mmm, they're perfect—sweet but not sickeningly so. You used to trek across town for these all the time. Now you're literally running a corporation. Can't you just send someone to get them?"" Mia wiggled her foot as he massaged her ankle.  
  
The look on Jasper's face was pure devotion. ""Anything that matters to you, I handle myself. Always.""  
  
Mia's face lit up as she wrapped her arms around his neck and kissed him. He pulled her closer, completely lost in the moment.  
  
Watching them, Freya felt like she'd been punched in the chest, a bitter ache spreading through her. Her fingernails dug deep into her palms, leaving bloody crescents behind.  
  
As the meeting time approached, Freya composed herself and knocked lightly.  
  
""Mr. Whitemore, your meeting's about to start.""  
  
Hearing her, Jasper tensed slightly and started to rise, but Mia tugged him back down.  
  
""Don't go yet. Five more minutes?"" She gave him puppy-dog eyes.  
  
Her playful plea melted his resolve instantly.  
  
""Push the meeting back two hours,"" he called out.  
  
This meeting involved a collaboration between major New York corporations that was crucial to the company's future. Freya knew its importance and couldn't help adding:  
  
""The CEOs from Verdean, Aurex, and Vireon are already in the conference room...""  
  
""God, Jasper, your assistant is such a buzzkill! Can't she take a hint?"" Mia rolled her eyes dramatically.  
  
Jasper's expression hardened instantly. ""I said postpone it two hours. Nothing comes before Mia, got it?""  
  
Freya felt like she couldn't breathe. In the end, she simply closed the door and walked away.  
  
Everyone in their circle knew Jasper was a workaholic machine. No matter what was happening personally—even right after surgery—he'd drag himself in to finish his work.  
  
Yet here he was, risking relationships with major partners because of a little whining. This was completely new territory.  
  
Did he really love Mia that much?  
  
Freya pulled herself together and walked into the conference room to face the waiting executives.  
  
The Whitemore empire was powerful enough that these CEOs, despite being pissed, wouldn't directly criticize Jasper. Instead, they unloaded on Freya.  
  
She took their verbal abuse silently, head down.  
  
After an excruciating two-hour wait, Jasper finally showed up. As Freya left the conference room on legs that felt like jelly, Mia called out to her.  
  
""You're Freya, right? Jasper says you make killer coffee. Everyone looks dead on their feet—whip up some for the whole floor? Mine with ice, no sugar.""  
  
Knowing her place in the hierarchy, Freya headed to the break room without protest.  
  
Two hours later, she finished preparing over four hundred cups, delivering them one by one.  
  
After just one sip, Mia's face darkened. She hurled her mug straight at Freya's head.  
  
The ceramic smashed against Freya's forehead, opening a nasty gash. She let out a gasp of pain and dropped to the floor, clutching her wound.  
  
Not satisfied, Mia grabbed more mugs and kept throwing them.  
  
Bruises bloomed across Freya's body as ceramic shards sliced her skin. Coffee soaked through her clothes, mixing with bright red blood dripping onto the floor.  
  
Despite the blinding pain, she could only curl into a ball, protecting her head and chest.  
  
The office went dead silent. Nobody dared step in as Mia continued her meltdown. They all kept their distance, watching in horror.  
  
The commotion brought Jasper out of his office. He surveyed the chaos and Freya's crumpled form with narrowed eyes.  
  
""What the hell happened?""  
  
Seeing him, Mia instantly switched to victim mode. ""Jasper, I asked her to make me coffee. I'm on my period, and she deliberately put ice in it. My cramps are killing me now.""  
  
Seeing her teary eyes, Jasper's face darkened immediately.  
  
""You've worked for me for four years and can't handle a simple coffee order? Or do you have some problem with Mia?""  
  
Freya raised her deathly pale face to explain, but he didn't give her the chance. He called over another assistant.  
  
""Dock her entire month's salary and quarterly bonus. Send a company-wide notice and have her make a public apology at next week's all-hands.""  
  
With that, Jasper draped his jacket over Mia's shoulders and led her away.  
  
Chapter 3  
  
As Jasper vanished down the corridor, the tears Freya had been fighting finally broke free.  
  
She forced herself up, wincing as she grabbed a broom and mop to tackle the mess of shattered ceramic and coffee.  
  
A few sympathetic coworkers came to help, their eyes full of pity.  
  
""I clearly heard her say 'with ice, no sugar.' How's she flipping this on you? Did you tick her off somehow?"" one whispered.  
  
""Like she needs a reason?"" another muttered. ""Everyone knows she's a total princess. Throws a fit over nothing. Half our circle can't stand her, but with Jasper in her pocket, nobody dares say boo.""  
  
""Man, I've never seen him this crazy about anyone. Freya, just watch your back. We're regular folks—we can't compete with trust fund babies. With Jasper backing her play, we just have to eat whatever crap they serve us.""  
  
Freya appreciated their support, but their words left her emotionally tangled.  
  
Once, when a client tried blaming her for their own mistake on a contract, Jasper had stood rock-solid behind her. He'd believed in her completely, fighting until her name was cleared.  
  
But now? Mia drops one casual lie, and he doesn't even fact-check or let her explain. He just assumes she's at fault.  
  
After years of dedication, handling countless fires for him—didn't she deserve that basic trust?  
  
Or in his world, did right and wrong not matter as long as Mia was happy?  
  
The thought left her heart feeling like raw hamburger.  
  
It took forever to clean everything before dragging her battered body home.  
  
She had barely stepped out of the shower when her phone lit up with Jasper's name.  
  
""Bring over some Advil and heating pads.""  
  
She threw everything together ASAP and headed to his penthouse.  
  
In just days, the once sleek space had transformed completely. The cherry tree his grandfather planted—gone, replaced by tulips. The black and white furniture he'd always preferred—swapped for pink and yellow pieces he used to mock. Display cases now showcased jewelry, designer bags, and gifts...  
  
Pure Mia, through and through.  
  
Freya took it all in silently before knocking on the bedroom door.  
  
Jasper opened it, grabbed the stuff, and finally glanced at her face.  
  
With the coffee cleaned off, her injuries looked brutal, making him pause.  
  
""Jesus. Have you had that checked out?""  
  
Freya just shook her head.  
  
He rubbed his temple, his tone softening slightly.  
  
""Look, Mia was just feeling like garbage. She wasn't gunning for you specifically, so don't take it personally. I'll add what I docked from your pay to your Christmas bonus. Get those wounds looked at—if they're bad, take a few sick days. I'll sign off on it, no red tape.""  
  
""That won't be necessary. At the end of this month—""  
  
Freya tried telling him about her resignation, but he cut her off, shoving a card into her hand.  
  
""Just do what I'm telling you. I need you to put together a welcome-back thing for Mia, so rest up and heal.""  
  
The words died in Freya's throat.  
  
She nodded, took the card, and turned to leave.  
  
As the door swung shut, she caught Mia's voice:  
  
""Babe, is that tea ready? Can you come rub my stomach?""  
  
""Coming right now. Just lie still and don't move, okay?""  
  
Hearing his tender tone, Freya smiled bitterly.  
  
Her own cramps were brutal too—she'd actually passed out at work multiple times and been rushed to the ER.  
  
When he found out? Just a signed time-off form. No visits, no tea, no heating pads.  
  
Back then, she'd told herself he was swamped with work.  
  
Now she got it—he just didn't give a damn.  
  
After leaving, Freya hit up urgent care for basic treatment.  
  
She crashed at home for a few days before getting bombarded with party specs from his assistant.  
  
Everything from floral arrangements to dessert selections to server uniforms came with ridiculous requirements.  
  
With just three days to pull it off, Freya pushed through her exhaustion to make it happen.  
  
After running herself ragged, the party kicked off at 7 PM sharp.  
  
Mia floated in wearing some couture masterpiece, immediately becoming the room's center of gravity.  
  
Guests swarmed her with compliments, feeding her ego.  
  
""It's been ages, but you're still that same knockout, Mia. Even a 'casual' welcome-back party looks like the Met Gala—clearly Jasper's still completely whipped!""  
  
""Remember college when some poor schmuck asked Mia out? Jasper literally got the guy transferred! He shredded love letters on sight, and when people talked smack about Mia, he put those dudes in the hospital!""  
  
""Everyone knows Mia's his kryptonite—the one he can't resist! Look at that ice she's wearing—gotta be worth a couple million! And that dress is one-of-a-kind. Jasper's always been 'price is no object' when it comes to keeping Mia happy!""

I’m a woman in my late 20s and have been living in Bangalore since 2019. Over the years, I’ve been fortunate to have a great group of friends who made the city feel like home. But life happens — many of them have moved abroad, relocated to new cities, or drifted into different life phases. Lately, I’ve found myself at a bit of a crossroads, feeling the absence of those deep, day-to-day connections.

As I’ve grown older, I’ve realized that making new friends — especially meaningful ones — isn’t as easy as it used to be. I’ve also found that I relate more easily to other women at this stage of life, where career decisions, personal growth, mental health, family expectations, and even just finding joy in the everyday — all take center stage.

I’d really love to build a small circle of women friends who are open to meeting up, having real conversations, supporting each other, and maybe even exploring the city together — whether that’s grabbing a coffee, catching a play, trying a new restaurant, or simply sharing stories and laughs on a weekend walk.

If you’re someone who also misses female friendships, is new to the city (or not!), or is just looking to rebuild your social circle with genuine people — feel free to drop me a message or comment below. I’d be happy to connect!

You know that feeling, right? One day you’re the life of the party, and the next, you’re contemplating whether it’s too late to get into Xtreme Croquet or something wild like that. **Spoiler Alert: It’s NEVER too late!** 

I’ve been on this wild ride of “let's explore vitality” for a bit now. It turns out that vibrant living doesn’t have an age limit. So, whether you're looking to shake off the cobwebs of the 9-5 grind or simply want to feel like you can chase your grandkids around again, I've got a few tips!

**Here’s how to work smarter, not harder:**

1. **Set Realistic Goals**: I mean, let’s be real—jumping into a triathlon might not be the best start. Aim for the little wins first!
  
2. **Stay Focused**: How many times have we said, “I’ll start tomorrow”? Tomorrow turns into next week, then next year! Let’s keep our eyes on the prize. 

3. **Enjoy the Journey**: Your well-being doesn’t have to feel like a chore. Find a hobby that excites you—gardening, painting, maybe even starting a podcast about your cats?

4. **Get Moving**: Start small. A short stroll around the block can do wonders. Bonus if you can find a friend to join—the buddy system keeps things fun and a whole lot less lonely. 

5. **Ditch the Guilt**: You worked hard to get here. It’s OK to indulge in a guilty pleasure now and then, whether that’s Netflix binging or enjoying that slice of cake. After all, isn’t life too short for wilted salad?

6. **Connect Socially**: Relationships are like the secret ingredient in the recipe for vitality. Bring your friends into the mix—dinner parties, game nights, or just a coffee date can reinvigorate your soul. 

And here’s a pro tip: **“Set realistic goals. Stay focused. Go home satisfied.”** Sounds easy, right? Check this out for some great resources: [Mavely](https://mavely.app.link/e/qBribQrKcTb)

Also, don’t forget to throw in a little humor! Seeing the funny side of things not only brightens your day, but it might just spark a joyful epiphany about how to reclaim your vitality.

1kq4xwv,https://www.reddit.com/r/SecretsOfMormonWives/comments/1kq4xwv/armchair_thoughts_on_the_cast/,Armchair Thoughts on the Cast,"I want to preface this by saying I’m intentionally leaving one cast member out of my thoughts. Giving her a title as “villain” and posting her photo everywhere is giving her *so. much. attention* which IMO is exactly what she wants. So for that reason, I’m only talking about the people that weren’t absolutely vile and unredeemable.

Jessie - At the beginning I really thought Jessie was a mean girl with how she was handling the whole Jen situation. I was surprised at that explosive coffee shop yelling match because on TikTok she seems like a genuinely sweet person who just loves her Dutch Bros. Her attitude towards Jen was appalling to me. However, after Jen sent that apology video and you see instantly how Jessie automatically gives her grace, and even rethinks her behavior during that coffee incident, she redeemed herself for me in that moment. I have no idea how that Jen, Jessie/Demi drama escalated so quickly, but I’m honestly guessing Demi and Zac had a huge part in making it worse. It’s very telling Zac was “confiding” in Demi about his marriage…

Taylor - The only thing I’ll agree with Demi on in this entire season is that crying videos are cringe. I was getting so burnt out of Taylor’s TikTok’s being constant crying sessions. However, now that I’ve seen the type of “support system” she has with her family and friends, it’s no surprise her coping skills are nonexistent and that she seeks validation from social media. I genuinely hope she has some real friends outside of momtok/social media that she can lean on.

Mayci - Hearing more about her past makes it a lot more clear as to why she stays silent and doesn’t stand up for anyone most of the time. While I wish she’d stand up for Taylor more publicly, I kind of get the vibe she doesn’t see herself as Taylor’s close friend. If Demi was going after Mikayla, I think she’d said something. 

Mikayla - Having her therapy session air on live TV was…..a choice. Especially with a topic that sensitive. I definitely think she could help a lot of girls with her story, but it just seemed so out of place with the rest of the show. Her support for Mayci is great to watch.

Layla - Yes, she didn’t stand up for Taylor twice, but she also acknowledged she didn’t twice and even felt bad about it. She’s young and not a leader and it’s very evident in how she conducts herself in group settings. I think it’s positive that she’s even acknowledging it and gives a great place for growth. 

Miranda - Seems nice enough. 

Jen - I sincerely hope she has some friends outside of momtok/social media that can support her. I think she could be very successful on her own social media wise without the group. Outside of Taylor, I think she has the most charisma. I wish her nothing but the best!

Whitney - Funny. She knows how to be a villain without being a monster. She reminds me of a softer Christine from Selling Sunset.

Liann - I really hope the producers were the ones who gassed her up to go to the Christmas party and she didn’t come up with that on her own. That BBQ was horrific and didn’t not show her in the best light, but as the season went on she seemed a bit better towards Taylor? I just think it’s hilarious that somehow Liann made it into about half the episodes…

After a couple of months of practice, I've finally gotten the hang of dialing in the grind size for espresso with my setup. When I get a new bag of coffee, I start with a test grind—if it chokes the machine, I know I need to go much coarser; if I get a double shot in 10 seconds, I know it’s too fast and needs to be finer.

What surprised me most is how much grind size can vary depending on the beans. I used to obsess over the grind range on my Encore ESP, but I quickly learned that I might use a setting of 10 for one bag and 20 for another—even though I’m always using medium to dark roasts.

Now I’m starting to explore V60 brewing, and I’m not sure where to begin with grind size. With espresso, it was easy to judge by whether the machine choked or the shot ran too fast. But with V60, there doesn’t seem to be a similarly clear indicator, and given how much grind can vary, it doesn’t seem helpful to aim for a specific number.

I’m looking for guidance on how to get into the right ballpark for V60 grind size. What should I be watching for?

She’s not with me, but she’s not moving out. 

It’s hard to handle. She lost her job and still goes out and parties.  Stays out for days and asks me for money for her cigarettes. “I spent all my money partying and paying for metro card” so give me money. “Give me money! I knew you don’t give a fuck!”

But she’s the one who broke up with me because she realized that she was only into being married because she was brainwashed into it by the mainstream of our youth. 

A time when kids still played house and pushed around a tiny stroller with a baby doll of their own inside it. 

{Naww} she said, “I want to be free and do what I want and go where I want to go without having to tell anyone what I’m doing or where I’m going. I belong to me and I exists and I want the world to hear me and see me”. 

That’s just the (outside) if you may. 
She claims that she strives for the attention of other men. She likes to entertain them and receive compliments and she dances and moans and drinks on camera for them. 
She said it empowers her. Proves to her that she doesn’t need a man. “This proves that I’m a strong woman”.  

“I’m still fucking hot. I can get any man I want. German. Scandinavian. Italian.  Argentinian. You? Your salt is all pepper.” (In reference to my salt&pepper hair). 

So she lives there and drinks all my coffee. Eats all my food. Leaves food everywhere and ants gather. She takes my money.. no, I give it to her. But I can’t help it. 

I have a restraining order but it’s not a full stay away. Instead she uses it to hang around and when I ask her to pick up after herself, she starts to yell for help outside accusing me of menacing her and breaking my own restraining order against her. 

I can’t do anything. I’ve given up on cleaning up.  But then a week passes and the mess is just unbearable. Stopped taking my Wellbutrin for weeks already. Just smoking tons and tons of weed. Guys next door got an infinite quantity of Jack Herer so that’s all day for me. 

Been eating so much more. I feel morbid. 

She drinks and blasts her new music. 
Corpsehusband and Grimes and the horrid Club music. The usual type that talks about how to go about intercourse with the other person in public and then not in public. 

When she’s blasting it and drunk and I can’t sleep; I feel like ending my life. And I sit there and take it. Because if I go outside, at 1-2-3 in the morning the she wins. I’m outside my home while she uses all my shit inside for her entertainment. My speaker. My food. All my coffee and eggs. All my cigarettes. Mind you this is New York and they cost me $18. 

Then disappears for days. 
“I’ll be with my friends - now give me $5 because I promised them I would antie up”. 

When she was gone I was healing. I was eating and working out. 
Now I’m overeating and overspending. 
Strange because I was terribly anorexic and frugal. 

Now I just let it all go, like the Buddhists. 
Except unlike a love or breath, the body doesn’t always come back the same. 

For weeks now I’ve been having a dissociative episode. Time just goes by. Days. Weeks. She comes, chills and goes. When she’s there i can’t relax. Doesn’t pay rent. Lost her job. wtf man

They were tired of building boring stuff—banking apps, enterprise dashboards, e-comm platforms. That night, something clicked.

Fast forward to today — they’re calling themselves **Nova Team**, and they’re deep into building a crypto casino where **skill actually matters**.

Think:

* Poker tables where solving puzzles gets you bonuses
* Blackjack where your strategy shifts the odds
* Slot machines that fight back — and you have to outsmart them

It’s fun, weird, chaotic, and full of potential.  
There’s just one major problem…

🧱 **They're backend devs.**  
🎨 **Their frontend is a crime scene.**

They’ve tried. Oh, they’ve tried. But after 47 failed attempts to center a div, they said screw it — let’s ask for help.

# So here’s what they’re looking for:

* Someone who speaks **React or Vue** like it’s a first language (or close enough)
* Bonus if you’ve played with **Canvas/WebGL** or want to try
* You care more about building something cool and playable than chasing Web3 hype
* You're okay collaborating with a team that codes from cafes and debates game mechanics over шопска салата (Google it — it’s good)

They’re already live on **CollabClan** (finally), and would love to work with someone who’s:

* Down to build slick, responsive game UIs
* Up for experimenting with crypto integration that doesn’t suck
* Not afraid of a little chaos and a lot of fun

They don’t have HR or fancy onboarding.  
Just message them and say:

1kq4vts,https://www.reddit.com/r/zerobags/comments/1kq4vts/zerobagfaux_trip_to_oahu/,Zerobag(faux) trip to Oahu,"I traveled to Oahu for a week this month and wanted to share it as the zerobag mentality definitely helped me in many ways. Apologies before hand with the word vomit below.  But before we begin some context is needed:
1) I'm a father of two (toddler and infant) and was traveling with both as well as spouse and in-laws. They don't zerobag and I'm not sure how kids could ever really do it. 
2) We stayed at a rental condo in Waikiki that came with laundry options, soap/shampoo, as well as cookware. It was also within walking distance of three ABC stores (convenience)
3) I didn't borrow any items or utilize the family luggage space, but I did carry one backpack for all the kids stuff such as diapers, snacks, toys, snacks, extra wipes, snack, iPad, snacks... also their passports because TSA was doing the RealID push at the time. 
4) I've got some health issues so I take multiple medications daily. 
5) Oahu was a constant 70-80degree weather and it's acceptable to wear t shirts and shorts and slippers to everything. 
6) I'm not unkempt but I'm also in that dad mode where I'm not worried about the image I present in public as long as I don't smell and have clean clothes: so I have pretty short hair (no need for hair gel), the inability to grow facial hair fast (so I shave once a week and don't mind stubble so no need for razor), and what I've been told is minimal BO (so I don't wear deodorant) (side note: i really really really hope this is true). 

What I wore:
* hat
* sunglasses
* contacts
* garmin instinct2x (which is sort of a smart watch with a flashlight and decent battery life so no need for an Apple Watch charger)
* uniqlo AIRism cotton sleeveless shirt
* rash guard with long sleeves - random amazon brand that was cheap and worked well
* uniqlo ultra seamless boxer briefs
* western rise evolution pants (v1)
* arcade belt
* darn tough tactical(?) no show socks
* crocs literide 360 pacer sneaker - these are nice, breathable, and lightweight. They don't drain water well because the holes are higher and there not fully water proof because there's still some cloth material around the ankle that stays wet. 

What I kept in a small fanny pack, that was either on my person in the backpack with the kids stuff:
* iPhone
* foldable toothbrush
* contacts for 7 days
* slim wallet with three credit cards, some cash and my license 
* small ziploc with bandaids and moleskin
* another pair of underwear
* another pair of socks
* anker 45w 313 charger
* anker usbc to usbc cable 6ft
* anker magnetic battery
* western rise boundless shorts
* four bottles of medication with prescription information. 
* syzy compact tote bag

What I bought when I got to my travel destination:
* toothpaste
* mints
* sunscreen - this is important for Haiwaii because they are strict on reef safe sunscreen
* slippers for the beach
* lots of spam masubi and royal mills coffee
* extra tshirt
* multiple cases of bottled/jugs of water

Learnings:
1) I didn't need the extra credit cards. With most merchants, I was actually able to pay with my smartwatch. I should have brought one backup instead of 3. I might travel next time with just a money clip or cash and my license and spare credit card. As wireless payment gets more ubiquitous, its harder to justify carrying multiple cards. 
2) Random leson: Rental Car Agencies at some point now allow you to completely check in online now so I could fill out credit card details through my phone and went straight to the pickup area.  
3) My phone is the biggest single point of failure for my travels. It holds all my reservation details, numbers, credit card info, directions, camera/photos, etc... but it also why I can travel without almost anything else. 
4) I need a better way of carrying multiple medications.  The multiple bottles were super annoying and took up a lot of space. 
5) I need to switch to a smaller charging cable and a smaller charger. I also had no use for the magnetic battery and I'm wondering if its worth the trouble of taking it.  I'm probably going to go for a shorter 3ft cable and the anker nano 20w charger. 
6) I did laundry every two days along with the rest of the family. But if I were by myself, I could have probably washed my clothes in the shower.  The rental had laundry pods.
7) Darn tough socks are amazing.  I could get by with at least two days of wearing.
8) I didn't need to wear long pants. I should have just stuck with shorts both on the plane and off.
9) The AIRism underwear were super thin and comfy.  They pack up super small. 
10) I've got a pair of Xero Shoe sandals at home but I never liked wearing them to the beach because of how hard it was to take them on and off.  Thats why I bought slippers in Haiwaii.  It was kind of wasteful to buy them, wear them for a week, then drop them off at a donation box (better then throwing them away).  I still need to think through a better way of handling shoes for beach destinations. I wore the t-shirt i bought as an extra layer on the flight back.
11) The tote bag was super helpful at the beach for carrying random kid gear, sand toys, and water bottles.  I really like this tote bag and how small it packs.  I might even just use it alone next time and not carry the fanny pack. 
12) I made a choice to not bring air pods or ear buds.  On the plane I had a lap child, and off the plane I was pretty focused with kid care or just immersion in the environment.  Music might have made it better if I were alone traveling, but with family and kids, I don't regret this choice.  
13) Bandaids and moleskin were really useful for other family members.  I might consider additional travel medication as part of my kid bag though.  
14) The zero bagging mentality really shined for me.  Having less stuff for myself enabled me to carry stuff for the kids as well as just ease of mind.  When going through TSA, i could carry my infant child on one arm, the bag with their stuff on my back, and a foldable infant stroller.  We still had check in luggage for the inlaws/children stuff but I didn't really have to worry as much about packing and unpacking.  
15) It'd be nice if I didn't need contacts. Or maybe I should find a pair of foldable glasses with transition lenses? (that can withstand my infants grabby hands?)
16) I know I wasn't truly zero bagging as I had the fanny pack and I was technically traveling with luggage/bags but I still enjoyed the thought process and mental gymnastics of having to work through it all.  

Thanks for reading through this all and until the next trip :)

My family is cruising the Sapphire Princess in Alaska at the end of the month. One thing I haven't been able to find an answer to is if there's prepackaged drinks I can buy onboard (think cans of soda or, preferably, bottles of lemonade or iced tea or something) to store in my room's cabin so I can have something with flavor that isn't coffee when I wake up in the morning BEFORE needing to interact with any people for the day. Initially I was thinking of picking up a pack of pure leaf teas or something in Vancouver, but rereading the policy it sounds like because they're in plastic they'd be not allowed, so I'm like 'do I just grab a bunch of arizona cans from a minimart real quick (cumbersome) or is there something less annoying that can be achieved on the ship?'

CHAPTER 10 Old and New Surprises

 *“So, you ready to close up shop for the night and head home?” her co-worker asked. “After all, the bodies of these aliens will still be here tomorrow. I know that the entire League is waiting on our final report, to hopefully find something out about our odd pirates, but we already sent them the autopsy reports.”*

*She shook her head. “Fat lot of good they did, too. Disturbing as they are with their general resemblance to us, they are still more different from us than our fellow Humans who have grown up on lower-gravity planets. Still, there is something about how they developed that gnaws at me. Anyway, hold on just a minute, the initial report on the genetic sequencing should come in… ah, there it is.”*

*She turned to the screen, read the first few words, and felt the blood run from her face. Her vision blurred for a moment, and got dark around the edges. “No.” She whispered. “No, it can’t be.”*

*Her co-worker, a man who was old enough to remember The War, even if it had been in his youth, gave her a worried look and raised an eyebrow in an invitation for her to speak. She worked her mouth, but couldn’t get sound to come out. She finally just pointed to the screen.*

*He leaned over and started reading, a hand casually on her shoulder. After a few moments, that hand began to shake, and he barely seemed to manage to find a seat.*

*She turned back to the report, hoping against hope to find some flaw in the data, then she heard a thump. Her colleague had fainted and fallen to the floor in a heap.*

 \*\*\*

Julia looked at the report on her desk with much the same expression she might use if faced with a viper poised to strike. Which, to be fair, is much what she felt like it was. A quiet knock sounded at her door and she tried – without success – to bring some blood back into her face. After a moment Katja walked in. Her boss looked at her, shut the door, locked it, perched herself in a chair, cocked her head slightly to one side, and waited.

Julia had to work her mouth a few moments before the words came. She wanted to wail, to scream, to cry, to flail at the unfairness and evil of a cold, hard universe, at what she was going to have to do to her father.

The words that came out, however, came out small and timid. “This will kill him.”

Katja sat there, still, for a few moments and looked at her. Finally she said, “He is a resilient man, always has been. This is something that is going to hit him hard, I know – I know it all too well, really, I watched the live feed back then – but he will…”

Julia shook her head hard, and tears flew in all directions. “No, you don’t understand. That day… that loss… Dad was always willing to share with us the details of history, of what happened Back Then, when he was in this place. Or, for that matter, what happened before; when he was trying to fight the shadow governments on pre-FTL Earth, or… He told us, several times, the story of the time he practically *died* at the end of the war: the one Mom always walked away crying if she heard.

“This one, though. This *one* story, THAT day… he refused to ever speak of. Even obliquely, even when we got to it in our History classes that he was home-schooling. He walked us right up to that day, then the next morning Mom was there with a video for us to watch.

“I caught him, at one point, standing in the doorway of the room. I’d turned my head because I’d heard him crying. He looked at me with eyes that made my young heart break, then turned and *fled.* He didn’t just leave that doorway, Katja, he *fled.*

“That wasn’t the only time I’d seen my Father cry, of course, but that night… It *was* the only time I heard him wake screaming.”

Julia buried her head in her hands and cried. They sat there for some minutes, Katja still, quiet, but somehow radiating empathy and acceptance. The woman didn’t move from her seat, but Julia found her presence to be somewhat stabilizing… like her boss had provided her a safe space to let her work through her own feelings.

Eventually the tears wound down and she reached for a tissue. Katja finally moved and slid the box over to her hand.

After giving her a few more moments to recover, Katja spoke. “It may not be that, though, correct? I didn’t read all of the details, but genetic testing on bodies left in the Void that long can’t be that precise, can they?”

Julia shook her head. “Oh, they can and they are, with modern techniques. Besides, even if the testing wasn’t precise enough to nail down exactly who these people came from, we’d still know that they are Human, for all that they seem short and too pale.”

The older woman got a far off look for a moment. “Yes, they do look odd, and don’t seem like Humans. Too short to be an average Human, not short enough to have dwarfisim, and all of them too close in height to believe that they are some sort of anomalies among their kind.”

*I can see what she is doing. An intellectual debate might work to get me distance, but the relief won’t help. I need to get this to Dad. I guess it is a good thing he is here, as much as some cowardly part of me wishes he wasn’t. Still…*

“One of the reasons the testing took so long to come to its conclusion is that there was a lot of genetic manipulation: Bad, ham-fisted manipulation even by the standards of the time, but effective enough. The report is deliberately vague about it, but makes it clear that the mortality rate on the offspring of the initial subjects must have been very high.”

“That is believable, considering the perpetrators, but I don’t understand why…”

“The genetics were probably done to try and make them more docile, easy to control. Their pale complexion probably comes from living a life in the Void – which we know they do from the dissections. There are subtle differences to how artificial gravity works on the body versus what is natural, and these subjects show signs…”

Julia shook her head to clear it, then waved a dismissive hand. “This is all well and good, and is information we need to pour over. With my Father, and Uncle Kaz… who is not going to take the information much better than my Father will. He was there too, you remember. He was still the ‘Special Ambassador’ to the Venter at the time.”

Katja nodded. “Yes, you are right, of course. Would you like me to come with you?”

Julia hesitated for a moment, then a moment more. The offer tempted her, and she felt shame at the fact, but she knew the answer.

“No. This is a family matter at this point. Once Dad gets over the pain and shock of it, he’s going to have a need, a *burning need*, to do SOMETHING about it. We may have too…”

Katja held up a hand. “Yes, we may. Or, we may not. There is a lot he can get away with as a private citizen. Your father wears his banishment like a comfortable blanket that he wove with his own hands, which, I suppose, he did. It might be better in the mid-term for him to still have it.

“Go, do what you need to do. I have no advice for how to approach the matter: They are your family, and you know best. The only thing I can give you is to say to trust yourself. You are a good woman, and a good daughter. You know the best way to do this.”

Julia rose, dried her cheeks again, and started to make herself look presentable. Then she stopped. Word on this would get out soon enough, and no one would question why she looked the way she did. Her hands dropped to her sides.

“I will tell Mom first. Dad will not have an easier time getting the news from both of us, but it will be better if Mom has already worked through the start of her grief before he has to take the hit. I just wish I could….”

She took a deep breath and shook her head. “The irony of all of this: Father only said one thing about that incident, *once*. After we were all adults, at one of our infrequent family gatherings, we’d all gotten drunk, and we got to him to talk about that day. He said he’d seen a flash of light in all of the fire that consumed that ship. He could never be sure, but he hoped it had gotten away, and that he hoped the people on board managed to find a good place to settle and live out peaceful lives.

“Turns out he was half right: The ship got away, but it seems the Old Leaders – even after they’d finally died from their hubris – managed to make the slaves on the Phoenix from Hallistifar suffer even more. Gods and Heavens… what must they think of us?”

 \*

Mom came into their quarters with a look of hesitation on her face: Ever since they had started coming on a regular basis, Julia had gone to find her mother if she wanted to talk. Texts were rare, and summoning her mother to talk to her – alone – that was a significant break of her normal patterns. Mom knew that probably meant trouble, though Julia could see that Mom also had some slight hope that maybe there was good news to be shared.

*Gods, Heavens and Hells, I wish it were so.*

She watched her mother take one look at the bottle of whiskey on the coffee table and her heart fell as she watched that faint hope die. Mom grabbed the glass off the table, downed it, poured another, and sat back.

They studied one another for a moment and Mom spoke with a tiny bit of edge in her voice. “I can tell you have been crying, darling. I know that you handle your personal affairs with a lot of guards on your heart, so if some man – or woman – has played with your heart with enough deception to put you in this state, I want a name. No, I want several names: theirs, and whatever next of kin will need to be notified.”

She tried to smile at her mother's momma-bear routine, but it came out thin. She could see the alarm bells go off in her mother’s head at the reaction. 

Mom sat forward, took a sip of her drink, and turned a level stare on her. “Ok, what has happened. I’m a big girl, I promise you can take it.”

She opened her mouth, then hesitated. Mom’s look of concern grew, and Julia grabbed herself with an internal iron hand… or tried to. That look of sympathy from her mother disarmed her.

She finally gave up and let the tears begin again. “Mom, you may want to set that glass down first. I imagine you can probably take this, but Dad… Just…” She shook her head and took a deep breath.

Mom slowly, with a  look of growing alarm, sat down the glass. “Something has happened to your Father since I saw him this morning?”

She shook her head again. “No, not that. Something might when we tell him, though… Mom, the genetics profiles on those pirates out on the fringe came back. The ones from the strangely short race? They... oh, Mom!” She covered her face with her hands, and Mom seemed to vault the table to sit with her arm draped over her shoulders and begin to rock her back and forth as if she was still a child. At that moment she almost felt like one.

The coffee was terrible, the Wi-Fi was worse, and they were arguing over something completely random:

**“What if a casino wasn’t about luck? What if it was… a game?”**

Not just another crypto slot machine. But something fun. Something where **skill actually mattered**.

They weren’t new to code. They’d built banking apps, e-commerce sites, boring enterprise stuff that made you want to take a nap. But that night? Something clicked.

Fast-forward to today—  
They call themselves **Nova Team**. They’re building a crypto casino where **you play to win** because you’re smart, not just lucky.

Like:

* Poker tables with puzzles and brainy side quests
* Blackjack where real strategy gives you an edge
* Slots you don’t just spin—you outthink them

It’s wild. It’s chaotic. It’s **genuinely cool**.  
There’s just one catch...

They suck at frontend.

No joke—after 47 tries to center a div, they gave up.  
They’re backend pros, but their UI? It looks like MySpace had a bad day.

So now they’re looking for **you**.

# Here’s the vibe:

* Build UI that feels alive—smooth, fun, and actually looks good
* Help turn crazy game ideas into stuff players *actually* enjoy
* Work with a small team that codes from cafes and argues about game mechanics over local salad (it’s called шопска салата, it’s delicious)
* No corporate nonsense. Just ideas, caffeine, and code

They’re on CollabClan now .  
No HR bots. No 12-step application.

Just hit “Apply” or message them something simple like:  
**“Hey, I can center your divs. Let’s chat.”**

so wanna to collaborate with global teams of builder go and apply on collabclan",1,1747635679.0,indianstartups,0,1.0,False
1kq4ruu,https://www.reddit.com/r/frugalsupplements/comments/1kq4ruu/unexpected_ldl_spike_after_using_bigmuscles/,Unexpected LDL Spike After Using BigMuscles Purely Whey – Seeking Insights,"Hey everyone,

I wanted to share a recent experience I had with BigMuscles Purely Whey protein and see if anyone else has encountered something similar.

Background:
I’ve been incorporating whey protein into my routine for a while now, primarily to support muscle recovery and meet my daily protein needs. Recently, I decided to try BigMuscles Purely Whey due to its affordability and the brand’s popularity.

Observations:
	•	Taste: Despite choosing the unflavored variant, I noticed a subtle sweetness and a hint of coffee-like taste. This was unexpected and made me question the “no added sugar” claim.
	•	Mixability: The powder didn’t mix well, leaving lumps regardless of shaking or stirring. This made the consumption experience less pleasant.
	•	Label Accuracy: Upon inspecting the nutritional information, I found discrepancies. The amino acid profile per 100g summed up to more than 100g, which doesn’t add up. This raised concerns about the accuracy of the labeling.
	•	Authenticity Verification: The product includes a scratch code for authenticity verification. However, I discovered that entering random codes still yielded a “success” message, which undermines the credibility of the verification process.

Health Concern:
After about 15 days of using this protein, I went for a routine health check-up. To my surprise, my LDL cholesterol levels had spiked to 176 mg/dL, which is significantly higher than my previous readings. I haven’t made any other notable changes to my diet or lifestyle during this period.

Conclusion:
While I can’t definitively attribute the LDL increase to this protein supplement, the timing and the aforementioned observations have made me skeptical about the product’s quality and transparency. I’m considering switching to a different brand that offers more reliable quality assurance.

Has anyone else experienced similar issues with BigMuscles Purely Whey or other protein supplements? I’d appreciate hearing your thoughts and recommendations.

I have a good job, a nice place, and I'm in decent shape, but I'm lacking genuine connections.

I moved here for work about 10 years ago, and while I've built a career and comfortable life, I never figured out the friend part. Time flew by, and now I find myself with plans to celebrate my birthday... alone (Wife is going to in-laws for the month).

 I enjoy reading sci-fi, can hold conversations about anything and make a mean filter coffee.

Looking for people around Chennai (I'm in Tambaram).  Just genuine people to share conversations and experiences with.

If you're in a similar boat or have a group that wouldn't mind a new face, drop a comment or DM. I promise I'm not as awkward in person as this post might suggest. Well, maybe a little.

I’ve been online to try and find a small 560ml (pint) jug to bring in milk, decanted from my home 4 pints (buying a 1 pint by its self is 4x more expensive!) 
Anyone else have this problem, I cannot find an appropriate vessel to transport then pour milk, surely this is a market that should have been cornered by now!?
