Was your cheater enmeshed with a sibling? Mine was. 

He (M/52) always treated his sister more like a wife than he did me. They lived together during their adulthood for years, vacationed together and went on long weekend trips together, were each other's plus-one to events, planned to buy a house together and live in it permanently, made major financial decisions together (sharing streaming services), and more. 

The sister moved away, and STBX visited her each year for a week. Their parents lived in the same area, but he would visit them only for a few hours. Meanwhile, he and his sister would spend a week dining out, going for coffee/tea late, going to the movies, planning their future vacations together, and so on. 

Eventually, STBX and I moved closer to the sister again. He insisted that it was normal for him to be gone all weekend long with her for dinner dates, coffee outings, movies, long drives, because their dad was unwell, and they ""needed to plan."" Every weekend. All weekend long. I simply was a mean hag for not ""understanding."" 

In my gut, I know this is weird shit, although STBX claims this is normal and how adults are with their siblings. 

Have you experienced this with a wayward, what seems to be poor boundaries and an overly close relationship with a sibling? ",1,1747916647.0,survivinginfidelity,1,1.0,False

1ksp5x3,https://www.reddit.com/r/colonoscopy/comments/1ksp5x3/just_got_home/,Just got home.,"I’ve been lurking here for a while and found it very helpful so thought I’d pass it forward.
I’m 62, UK based, no symptoms but there was blood in my poo test so they wanted to check. 
I had a Thursday screening so switched to a low fibre diet from Monday through to Wednesday. Easy peasy. 
Prep - I was more bothered about the prep than the procedure. I had Plenvu and Dose 1 was scheduled for 8.00pm. I favour a morning poo after a strong coffee and it’s rare I poo after midday but on Wednesday evening I had to have one at about 7.00 - mind over fecal matter perhaps. Dose 1 was mango flavour, but salty. It’s not lovely but I followed each slurp with a sip of water that took the saltiness away and left a more pleasant taste. It took about an hour to kick in and I went three times between 9 and 10.30. They were all fine and each time my body gave me enough warning and it didn’t trouble my sleep. 
My appointment was early so I had to take Dose 2 at 5.30. Fruit punch allegedly, tasted like bubblegum. Once more it kicked in after an hour or so and I pood liquid two or three times.
I drove 45 minutes to the hospital, never felt in danger of a poo. 
Procedure - I wouldn’t say painful but definitely uncomfortable, more from the air pumped in than the camera. As I was driving I could not have sedation but I could use gas and air. I didn’t use it until it got uncomfortable. With hindsight I would say it will almost certainly get uncomfortable so hit the gas and air straight away. 
The literature I was sent in advance said I might be there 5 hours and I didn’t feel I could ask the Mrs to drive me and hang around that long. In reality I was in and out in 90 minutes which seems to be the norm. If you are nervous about the discomfort/pain get a lift or a cab and have sedation.
Drove home, no issues, felt farty but nothing more.
Interestingly it is now 24 hours since I ate a small lunch of rice and I don’t feel hungry yet. 
For the record everything seemed fine.
Good luck everyone.

Now I Think They Were Meant to Protect Other People From Me.,"My New Security Job Had Strange Rules. Now I Think They Were Meant to Protect Other People From Me.

I needed the job.

Just something steady—something quiet. The kind of work where no one asks questions, and you don’t have to talk to too many people.

The listing said: Overnight security, no experience necessary. Surveillance-focused. Low traffic. $20/hr, paid weekly.

Sounded perfect.

The place was called Mickey’s Americana Diner. One of those washed-out 24-hour spots you drive by without noticing. The neon sign didn’t work right, and the parking lot was cracked to hell. But I didn’t care. I showed up at 9:45 PM sharp.

Lowell was waiting for me by the side entrance. Thin guy, late fifties maybe. Greasy ball cap. Yellow teeth. Tired eyes. He barely looked at me as he handed me the keys.

“You just stay in the office, keep an eye on the monitors,” he said. “Nobody should be coming in through the back, especially not after 2:00. If they do, follow the rules.”

He handed me a laminated sheet.

⸻

SECURITY PROTOCOL – NIGHT SHIFT
	1.	Do not engage with anyone who enters after 2:14 AM through the back door.
	2.	If someone smiles without blinking for longer than ten seconds, they’re not human.
	3.	Anyone wearing outdated uniforms or clothes from before 1990 must be escorted out—calmly, but firmly.
	4.	The man with no eyebrows is not real. Do not speak to him.
	5.	If someone says they know you, and you don’t recognize them, do not pretend you do.
	6.	Use the axe only if absolutely necessary.

⸻

I laughed. Thought it was a joke. Like hazing for the new hire.

But Lowell didn’t smile.

“You’ll understand eventually,” he said, and left without another word.

The first night was fine. Boring. I watched grainy black-and-white monitors and did a quick patrol every hour. The place smelled like fryer grease and lemon cleaner. A few lights flickered, but nothing weird.

Until 2:19 AM.

Motion sensor near the delivery entrance tripped.

I checked the monitor. A man was standing there, just outside the glass.

He was tall. Wearing a red knit sweater. Smiling.

And he didn’t blink.

I stared. Counted to ten.

Nothing.

He didn’t move. Just kept smiling—wide and unnatural, like he was trying to remember how to smile. I didn’t open the door. I didn’t even breathe. I locked the hallway and waited until he disappeared from the screen.

The next night, it was a woman in a teal dress. Looked like something out of a decades-old Sears catalog. She waved at the camera. Didn’t blink either.

They kept coming.

Some knocked. Some whispered through the cracks in the door. Some just stood there, staring. I stopped doing patrols. I kept the axe closer.

One night, someone got in.

He was already in the dining area when I saw him—table four, facing the kitchen, sipping from a coffee mug that should’ve been empty.

He didn’t have eyebrows.

I grabbed the axe.

He smiled and said my name.

I didn’t remember him.

He didn’t bleed much. Not at first.

But when I went to drag the body out the back like I was supposed to, it was gone. No blood trail. No mess. No proof.

Lowell never said a word. Just left a sharper axe in the box the next night.

I kept following the rules.

There was another man in a bellhop uniform. A woman in nurses’ scrubs from the ’70s. A kid who looked like my brother did when he was twelve, but with black pits for eyes. I did what I had to do.

By week three, I’d logged 23 incidents in the ledger.

Then came Hailey.

She looked normal. Hoodie, jeans, nervous energy. Said she worked prep for the morning shift. She even had a badge.

I told her she needed to leave. That she didn’t belong here.

She looked confused. Scared.

“You trained me last week,” she said. “Remember? You showed me the cameras—”

She reached out to touch my shoulder.

So I used the axe.

She cried the whole time. Screamed like a real person. Begged.

I told myself she was faking it. That she was one of them.

But when I went to drag her body outside, Lowell was there.

Just standing. Pale.

His hands were shaking.

“You need to leave,” he said, barely above a whisper. “Right now.”

“But she wasn’t—”

“There are no rules. Not for you.”

Then he called someone.

I left before they got there.

Now I’m holed up in a motel outside town. Axe under the bed. Logbook full.

But last night, I saw one of them again.

He was standing across the parking lot. Red sweater. Still smiling.

I think they’re following me.

I think they’re waiting.

1ksp19y,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1ksp19y/anorexia_rejected_from_everywhere_went_to_er/,"Anorexia, Rejected from everywhere, went to ER, rejected again.","21F, 5’2, 89lbs

history: polycystic kidney disease, VwD, dysglycemia, mitral valve prolapse, pvcs/svt 

As stated in previous posts, I have basically received no help. I have been rejected everywhere due to discomfort with my medical conditions or not being sick enough. I was referred to denver Acute but my BMI isn’t low enough for them. 

I went to the ER due to a massive increase in my pvcs & mini runs of what felt like svt. I was very uncomfortable and veryyyy short of breath. 

I don’t and didn’t want to die from starving but nobody will help me refeed so I am doing it on my own. Went from mainly 50-650 a day depending on the week (mainly 500 & below) to 2500+. My chest is consistently tight, more palpitations, feeling consistently weak, and obviously my GI system is more than confused. 

They weighed me with a heavy jacket, phone & bag in hand, shoes on. Naturally that increased my weight. When I asked about further support or help “your bmi isn’t low enough.” At this point I am convinced I am going to have to be dead on the ground for help which is frustrating. 

They checked a Complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, Lipase, Troponin, PTT, prothrombin time. 

At the ER my abnormal lab values were:

- Alk Phos: 41 (50-136)
- BUN: 4 (7-20)
- Chloride: 114 (98-110)
- Carbon Dioxide: 18 (21-32)
- K: 3 (3.5-5.1)
- Corrected Calcium: 7.9 (9-10.1)

- Magnesium: 1.4 (1.6-2.3)

- HGB: 11 (12-16)
- HCT: 34 (37-47)
- Lymphocyte: 3.9 (0.8-3.4)
- RBC: 3.4 (4.2-5.4)

They gave me: 20meq of IV potassium, oral potassium, IV cardizem. 

They didn’t recheck anything before I left. However I am not the Dr so idk

My ekgs are in comments! 

This was a smaller hospital so maybe they just lacked capabilities but idk. I just wanted to cry because I finally come and am honest and to the eating disorder in my brain I was basically just called fat. I’m trying to stay on top of the eating but my body continues to feel like something is just off and it is making it difficult to desire to eat especially given eating increases my palpitations like crazy. 

The potassium replacement had me palpitation free for roughly 36 hours and they have returned. My blood sugar has been odd. At first I was just incessantly spiking, staying high, or having weird spikes hours later. Now I am having a lot of reactive hypo patterns starting yesterday. Had black decaf Coffee with creamer & 2 mini sausage biscuits this AM. Spiked to 200 and then had a plummet to 50s not even 1.5 hours later. (not my usual patterns) 

Is it even worth seeking treatment again? I considered going to our teaching hospital if my heart doesn’t get ahold of itself. They just don’t have an eating disorder team on the adult side so I’m not even sure if it would be beneficial. The eating disorder dr I saw for some reason does not want to refeed me. (he works in children’s side) But I literally can’t get help until somebody has monitored me through refeeding and said, she’s stable! 

Any advice is appreciated. 

edit to say: I have called all the residential facilities in my insurance since my post history in this sub. Nobody is comfortable refeeding me in that setting but Denver Acute has said I am not sick enough for them. ",1,1747915679.0,AskDocs,3,1.0,False

I've had nothing for the past 2-3 days except black coffee, water and some salt and kreatine monohydrate. And when i brushed my teeth I make sure not to swallow.

I also haven't drank alcohol for about 76hrs and stopped smoking weed around the same time as the fast however I still smoke tobacco but am about to run out today and not planning in buying more.

Symptoms: I feel cold yet im sweating all day. I have a headache for like 10min every hour. Its hard to get to sleep but when I do I slept for 10hours. I feel bloated and my energy levels are low and I have a mild shake in my left hand. And my breath stinks and my mouth feels constantly dry. I drink a glass of water every other hour im awake.

""So do you have a favorite among your collection?"" 


Now that is a question that certainly has been put to every great collector in history. To whittle down their vast collection of splendid objects to just one exhibit when asked to do so, now that I think is a travesty to the significance of every piece in the collection.


But nonetheless, I do have a favorite amongst my humble reliquary of trinkets. 


He rests there in the middle of my collection, right between the 400 year old inscribed totems carved out of coconut trees, atop the shelf stacked with figures of lesser gods.


He is Erzats Haderas. He is a humanoid figure that has a surrealist interpretation of a bird's head, the size of a Labrador, and carved out of Lapis Lazuli. 


I picked him up from a vintage shop on the Malabar coast. I admit, it's an odd place to stumble upon such an empyrean languishing besides a dirty coffee pot and a tattered rug. But nonetheless, at the moment, I laid my eyes on him, I knew it was fated to be. 


The proprietor of that shanty establishment was a gaunt woman who looked to be no younger than a student in the later years of her postdoctoral education.


She gave me a sufficient rundown on the origins of the effigy. It originated from the Erzum culture. The ancestral forebearer civilization that once reigned across the inner hinterlands of the Malabar Coast. 


Erzats Haderas was a pagan god venerated by the people of Erzum. Erzumites considered him the god above all gods. In the once great temple of Garagoa, it is said that his statue was put in such a way as to float above the figurines of their conquered enemies' pantheons. The priests sang hymns to him everyday, they chanted ""Erzats Haderas is the greatest among all and he has no equal!"" 


That had been the way of things for many years until a new idol was brought to the once great temple of Garagoa and it was placed in the same manner as Erzats Haderas above all the other idols. The priests chanted as usual, ""Erzats Haderas is the greatest among all and he has no equal!""


But in the same breath, the priests started to chant ""But there is also Tubana and she is greater than the rest!"" 


A new dynasty had subsequently swept into power and had brought in a new god into the Erzumite Pantheon, and she was placed as a counterpart to Erzats Haderas. 


This is said to have sparked a rivalry between the two gods and brought an end to the prosperity of the Erzumites via natural calamities brought on by the warring deities. 


This particular idol is said to be the same  as the one that floated like a cloud above the graveyard of lesser beings in the once great temple of Garagoa.


It would seem that while adherents of Tubana or whoever else came thereafter, had taken to absconding with Tubana and  coterie of other once worshiped idols. Erzats Haderas was forgotten and left to wither away like the civilization that once worshiped him. 


As for how she acquired such a valuable piece of history and culture, she merely implied that she knew the grandson of the man who helped in the excavation of the once great temple of Garagoa. Which I was skeptical of, as the great temple of Garagoa has never been located, that is if you don't count the ramblings of some unsavory academics. 


It mattered to me not whether she was lying or telling the truth, I had become encapsulated by his majesty. I would have him no matter what. 


She was quite shrewd. She took one look at me and knew I had fallen for her bait. I thought I had been an expert at haggling with the locals. But she was another beast altogether. 


She might not have wanted me to have him; however, I was committed. 


She caviled at my offer, instead she made counter-offers of amounts that even a native couldn't imagine to earn in a year. 


I am generally a very patient man. I am renowned for it even, ask any acquaintance of mine. 


But her unrelenting demeanor forced my patience and the thought of leaving the coast without his majesty enraged me to no avail. 


I gave up on bargaining but not with my pursuit of Erzats Haderas. 


I could see that the situation called for a deviation of normal norms and somewhere I felt the pull of my caprice.


I returned to that ramshackle late at night, sneaking in from a broken window, and I appropriated the idol in a manner as to not damage it, but unfortunately I had not properly given heed to the whereabouts of that squabbling wretch. 


She hurled insults at me, and called me a number of things that I presume went along the lines of “Thief” and “Dirty Foreigner”, my understanding of the language was still in the primordial ocean of life and until that point, my vocabulary had been sufficient enough to persuade the locals. 


But this was not one of those haggling bazaar encounters. Thus my subsequent efforts to diffuse the situation through my enunciation of gibberish and hand gestures were unreciprocated by the other party. 


Even my offer of money, an enormous amount of money, mind you for someone living in that part of the world, was not enough to sway the woman from acting manic and constantly speaking over me. 


Her voice was irritating. It was hoarse like the grinding of stone or the sound of a creaking door hinge. All I could think about was making her stop making that noise. That awful noise. Out of her cacophony I could make out that she was going to be calling the neighborhood volunteer militia on me. 


A voice in my head said that I needed to stop her once and for all, and my body followed the command of that voice. 


Her voice pierced my ear canals with its loudness. I pity the spouse that had to keep up with her. 


She was more hardy than her meager frame would suggest but I would say she was nothing compared to the sino-communist progeny I had to face during my service in Sarawak. 


They fought with the ferocity of badgers, I'd go further to say that the communists were demons in human form. 


You know, in that green hellscape, fighting was hard and claustrophobic. You came face to face with death more often than not. And you had to be ready to shoot, stab, bash his skull and gut his insides out if you wanted to live to see the sunrise the next day.


Sometimes death came in the form of women with disdain for the authority of the white man.  


Erzumites fought in the same kind of battlefields ensconced by banana trees. Like the communists who spoke of Marx as if reciting divine script, the warriors as well chanted the deeds of Erzats Haderas as they charged to ambush their enemies. Of course later on, they adopted Tubana into their pre-battle rituals. 


Erzumites in fact are never recorded going head to head in pitched battles with their adversaries, they always employed guerrilla tactics and deception. Which was contrary to the tactics of their contemporaries. 


And to think they successfully carved out an empire through such tactics, one can draw a conclusion to explain as to why the communist menace has been able to fester and expand in the orient. 


Enemies of the Erzumites discounted their stratagem to cowardice, and their success to dark magic and their empire, even the last soothsayer allowed to conduct divine rites in Garagoa had foretold “would not last for it was brimming with evil.” 


Afterwards, the only soothsayers allowed into the temple were those of the defeated ilk who were to be sacrificed, their blood to be used in the making of warrior amulets blessed by priests of Erzats Haderas. 


Evil was everywhere in Sarawak. Evil squirmed around the paths we patrolled and the plantations we scoured, you could see the scars of communism on the lands, on the bodies of the dead. 


It wasn't always easy to see the taint. Sometimes they acted like normal god-fearing people and other times you could see them venerating the triumvirate idols of Marx, Lenin and Mao, assembled from the viscera of dead soldiers, villagers and government officials. 


I became quite adept at beating down death. Staring into his pupils as I plunged my knife into his stomach. Many men didn't have the leisure of thinking back on their experience in that infernal place. 


I owe my survival to my instructor. I wasn't always what you would call a proper gentleman. If you ask my childhood friend, Ewan, he'd tell you that I was a “moutchit”. In 9th grade, my school principal had entirely given up hopes on molding me into becoming a functional member of society. 


When I got to the boot camp, the instructor told me he'd make a disciplined and lethal instrument out of me that could withstand any pressure and overcome any odds. He certainly succeeded in that and more– 


Oh yes, pardon me for running off on that tangent. Back to the topic at hand. 


What happened to that woman you ask? 


Simply put, I dealt with her. For a man like myself, it was nothing more than breaking a twig in half. Though cleaning up was a laborious task. It was a dreadful mess. For good measure, I set the place ablaze while leaving. 


The idol required a very good polishing afterwards. Blood and sinew are really hard to clean especially getting them out from the crevices. She seemed to be unwilling to part with the figure even in death. 


It would take me another three weeks to smuggle him out of the country. It took a quarter of my savings to arrange that. 


In the meantime, I spent countless nights with him in my rented bungalow, I stared at the magnificent craftsmanship and sometimes it felt like he was trying to talk to me. 


Actually it felt like that way before when we first met. Like we had been telepathically linked somehow and it had been the plan all along for us to meet like this. 


The proprietor of the trinket shop being a final test of my devotion. 


It was like small ripples in the water at first. I couldn't make out what i was hearing or seeing. My dreams were blurry visions of a past I did not recognize. My incomprehension made me first be dismissive of the mental noises. 


But over time, the noise became more vivid like it was a story of a time gone by and I could feel the divinity spewing onto me from every tone and syllable. And there I was before it's ruin. 


The great temple of Garagoa in all its splendor lay before me. White stupas with intricate carved inscriptions shot high into the skies as if piercing through the stratosphere. The temple walls were inlaid with the finest of jewels. Servants both young and beautiful were running back and forth, adorned in sarees that glistened with all the colors of the spectrum and covered in intricate tattoos that looked to be henna, with copper platters full of roasted nuts and a variety of curries. 


A banquet was being held in the courtyard where singers sang in languages and tones that were inconceivable to human anatomy. Men, women and children danced and feasted under the auspices of sacrificed captives that hung from poles all contorted and twisted. 


I wandered through the revelry and into the temple's inner sanctum, and there he was dangling, floating above lesser beings. But he wasn't an inanimate statue as you would expect. No, he was a god in meditation. And he looked right at me and he spoke. 


He was beautiful in how he spoke and I started to believe. 


Now he sits on his righteous throne like the sun, above all and equal to no one. I see him in my dreams. I feel his loving embrace. I am in awe of him. I was CHOSEN by him. 


Erzats Haderas is the greatest among all and he has no equal! 


And once I find his begrudged rival, I shall strike down Tubana and she will be nothing. For Erzats Haderas has no equal.

1kson1a,https://albertaswell.substack.com/p/these-persons-are-attacking-us-because,Puro The Artist,"*By Staff Sergeant Chuckleberry McJokes*

**June 22, 2016** — In an unprecedented turn of events, our esteemed publication has found itself under attack by a mysterious group of individuals claiming that our recent exposé on the clandestine activities of renowned artist “Sir Paints-a-Lot” has put us in danger. But let’s be honest — we’re just doing our patriotic duty by exposing the truth behind the paint-slinging, graffiti-tagging, and interpretive dance routines that have taken the art world by storm.

**The Revelation That Got Them Riled Up**

Last week, our investigative team uncovered that Sir Paints-a-Lot, whose real name is reportedly “Bob the Brush,” has been secretly funded by a shadowy consortium of art supply companies seeking to monopolize the abstract expressionism market. Using clandestine meetings in art supply closets and covert spray-painting sessions on unauthorized walls, Sir Paints-a-Lot has allegedly been orchestrating a nationwide graffiti campaign designed to flood the streets with overpriced, low-quality canvases and spray cans.

Our sources confirmed that Sir Paints-a-Lot’s “art” is merely a front to push product sales and influence cultural trends, all while hiding behind the noble veneer of “creative expression.” Our exposé laid bare these nefarious schemes, and naturally, the art community and corporate interests didn’t take kindly to the truth.

**Who’s Attacking Us?**

Within hours of publishing, our social media accounts were flooded with threats, hate mail, and a suspiciously coordinated barrage of emoji-laden comments. The culprits? A loosely organized coalition calling themselves “The Creative Conspiracy,” which we suspect is comprised of rival artists, disgruntled gallery owners, and corporate shills—basically anyone who doesn’t want their cash cow exposed.

They’ve launched a disinformation campaign claiming that our reporting is “fake news,” “slander,” and “an attack on artistic freedom.” Some have even accused us of being agents of the government, which is a new level of paranoia even for us.

**Why Are They Attacking Us?**

Simple. Because we dared to reveal that Sir Paints-a-Lot is just another cog in the machine that’s manipulating the art scene for profit. By exposing his ties to corporate interests and revealing his actual identity, we’ve challenged the status quo. It’s akin to revealing that the emperor has no clothes—or in this case, that the “artistic genius” is really just a guy with a spray can and a penchant for fame.

**Our Response**

We here at [albertaswell.substack.com](http://albertaswell.substack.com) believe in transparency, truth, and the right to free artistic expression—particularly when it involves uncovering shady dealings that threaten the integrity of our cultural institutions. We will not be silenced by threats or coordinated smear campaigns. Our team is fortified with coffee, sarcasm, and an unshakable commitment to journalistic integrity.

**The Bottom Line**

If you see anyone claiming that exposing Sir Paints-a-Lot is somehow “attacking” artists, remind them that real art thrives on honesty. We’re just the messengers, folks. The real attack is on truth itself, and we won’t let up until the entire palette of deception is exposed.

**Stay tuned for more updates—and maybe some new graffiti art on the office walls, courtesy of our own creative team.**

“Captain” Chen said over the ship’s intercom bringing Hayes out of her funk with a jolt “Sorry to bother you, but we have an incoming transmission from UEN Command, Admiral Stone wants a word”

Hayes straightened her uniform “Patch her through” she said after a deep breath, time to get it over with.

The UEN crest rotating on the monitor flashed briefly before giving way to the severe but tired face of Admiral Stone “Captain Hayes” she said in a tone far too polite to be sincere “We’ve reviewed your report on your encounter with the slaver ship, all thirty-seven pages of it”.

 Hayes offered a cheerful nod “Did you like the part where Trade Master Zix’Kol eyes went pale when we transmitted our armaments specs”.

Stone pinched the bridge of her nose “I especially liked, and I will quote “This is a rescue missions” to the point, if a little on the nose”.

Hayes smile widened and she relaxed a little, she had known Admiral Madelyn Stone since she was a cadet, if she was being this familial then things weren’t as bad as she was dreading “I felt it encapsulated the moment”.

“Well” Stone sighed, rubbing her temples “Command concurs, in fact I think it is the first time in history that we have all agreed on something, your actions were in line with First Contact Protocol 7c Engage with empathy and enforce with strength, you and your crew represented humanity with, shall we say an aggressive form of diplomacy, good job and pass along the admiralties thanks to your crew”.

“Thank you, sir, I will pass it along to the crew” Hayes said

“Very good Captain, and now your new orders, you will change course to rendezvous with the medical ship Nightingale who will be better able to assist your guests, she will be joined by the Vengeance battlegroup as a precautionary measure” Stone announced, a tone of seriousness in her voice “Just in case those slavers try and reclaim their property”

Hayes smirked “Aye Sir, we will head to the rendezvous immediately”

At that precise moment Commander Rodriquez’s voice chimed through the ship’s intercom again “Captain to the bridge, all crew to battle stations, unknown contact has jumped into the system”.

“Excuse me Admiral, I have work to do” Hayes said curtly

“Good luck Captain, and if it is more of those slavers, you have my full permission to exercise more of that aggressive diplomacy” was Stone’s reply before the comms channel was closed.

Hayes walked onto the bridge of the Liberator, she could sense the tension in the air, but her crew remained professional and alert.

“Captain, new contact is broadcasting a demand for us to surrender and hand over their property, they are claiming they are the Bonded Extraction Enforcement Vessel Chains of Profit...” Chen’s voice tailed off and Hayes could see he was running the translation again “I kid you not Captain, they named their ship Chains of Profit”.

Hayes blinked “That’s got to be satire”

“Captain, they’ve armed weapons and have us targeted” Singh chimed in from tactical “Captain they’ve opened fire”.

The Liberator shook slightly, not from damage but from mild vibration, like a sneeze against a steel wall “Damage report” Hayes asked with a  sigh

“None” was Singh reply, visibly unimpressed “Our navigational shields took the hits sir, they weapons had the same impact as a stern look”.

Hayes moved over to the tactical station and read through the sensor data “Target their weapons and engines, disable them, but let’s do it nicely”.

Ten seconds later the Chains of Profit was adrift, its power systems fried and its weapons useless.

“Rodriquez, prepare a boarding party” Hayes ordered

“Chen” Hayes said turning to the viewscreen “patch me through to the enemy vessel, let’s see if they want to talk”

The viewscreen blinked revealing a large greasy looking being with dangling metal insignia and a sneer to match.

“You dare to disable a legally operating Hegemonic enforcement vessel” it hissed

“In your stupidity you fired on us first” Hayes snapped “and before you start your spew, we’ve covered the legal slavery speech already and I now find you boring and morally bankrupt and now you are being boarded”.

The screen cut off abruptly and within minutes the boarding party has gotten aboard the slaver vessel without any resistance, aided this time by an enthusiastic internal revolt of the ships enslaved crew, many of which were from the same species as the Liberator had rescued earlier, they quickly helped overpower their oppressors with tools, claws and what Rodriquez later described in his logs as quite frankly admirable creativity.

“Captain” Rodriquez voice came over the comms “uh, situation has been resolved, enemy crew has been neutralised”.

Hayes raised an eyebrow “Already, that was quick”

“Yeah, erm… the members of the crew who were here against their will held an impromptu democratic vote and as a result have just ejected the slavers out the airlock Captain” was Rodriquez reply “and they have also voted to rename the ship”.

“Rename the ship” was Hayes stunned response

“Unchained Destiny, kind of poetic really, they’ve asked if they can keep the ship and join us” Rodriquez said with a tone of someone enjoying his current assignment a little too much.

Hayes glanced over at Chen and then back at the screen which was still displaying the now repurposed slaver ship “Well, command did say they wanted stronger diplomatic footprint, I suppose a free ship crewed by liberated ex-slaves counts”.

“Lieutenant Chen, Open a priority channel to Admiral Stone”

Several minutes later Admiral Stone appeared on the viewscreen “Captain Hayes” she said slowly “give me the clip notes on your situation”

After updating the admiral with the latest interaction, the admiral pondered her response for a second “Captain, you will take the Liberator  and set course to rendezvous  with the Nightingale as previously ordered, and if the crew of the Unchained Destiny wish to accompany you, they are welcome too”.

Hayes nodded but before she could speak the Admiral continued “safe voyage captain, hopefully you will have an uneventful journey to save me from more paperwork” and with that Hayes noticed the smile forming on the Admiral face.

“Aye ma’am,  unless another slaver ship turns up, then no promises” was Hayes response said through a predatory grin.

Stone muttered something, possibly a prayer to every admiral before her, then disconnected.

 Hayes looked around the bridge “Alright folks, set course for the Nightingale and keep an eye out for anymore of Zix’Kol’s friends” she paused then sat down in her captain’s chair, letting her fingers drum once more against the captain’s chair.

The Liberator turned gracefully in space, flanked by the newly renamed Unchained Destiny as both ships sailed into the stars, one spreading diplomacy and the other spreading justifiable vengeance.

I am one of the few people on my campus in my department producing published studies. I’ve been here 6 years. The first 2-3 years everyone had established cliques, I wasn’t on campus as much because I taught weekend course but would see others at events. They were nice, cordial, made small talk but never invited me to get coffee or lunch when they would go during breaks at events. Very cliquey! I got use to it. Fast forward and I started being the only one to publish research frequently. One of the other 20 has one legit publication the last several years, a couple others I let work with me but because they were not given second author- started being distant (they did bare minimum). I notice now more people I never spoke to are trying to talk to me and I’m 99% sure it’s because of the national recognition my research is getting. I don’t know why, but it makes me mad. I’d be less mad if they continued to be distant in general but the “being more friendly” makes me more mad. I stil l extended an olive branch to one girl who I because a bit friendly with who was nice from beginning to me but even her who has not looked up how to do proper research said “thanks for not holding in all the knowledge and opportunities and wanting to work together” which also upset me knowing that’s probably the vibe I give off. These people publish in predatory journals instead of learning to do research properly and this whole time think I’m “greedy” for not collaborating with them. I attempted once with others but they knew nothing and a year later when speaking they didn’t use the time to watch YouTube videos on research methodology or anything. Is it me?

1ksohny,https://www.reddit.com/r/marketingclassonline/comments/1ksohny/types_of_google_ads_campaigns/,Types of Google Ads Campaigns,"When it comes to digital advertising, **Google Ads** is a beast. It’s one of the most powerful platforms for reaching potential customers right when they’re searching for what you offer. But for beginners (and even some seasoned marketers), one big question often arises:

**“Which type of Google Ads campaign should I choose?”**

The answer depends on your goals—whether it’s driving website traffic, generating leads, building brand awareness, or boosting sales.

In this blog post, we’ll walk you through the **main types of Google Ads campaigns**, how they work, and when you should use each one.

#  1. Search Campaigns

#  Ideal for: Lead generation, direct response, website traffic

**Search campaigns** show your text ads on Google’s search results page when someone types a query related to your product or service.

 *Example:* A user searches “affordable digital marketing course” and sees your ad at the top of the page.

#  Why Use It:

* High intent: People are actively searching
* Budget-friendly for small businesses
* Great for services and lead-based businesses

#  Considerations:

* Competitive industries may have high CPCs
* Requires solid keyword research and ad copy

#  2. Display Campaigns

#  Ideal for: Brand awareness, retargeting, visual promotions

Display ads appear across Google’s vast network of websites, apps, and YouTube, usually in the form of banners or images.

 *Example:* Your ad appears on a blog that discusses accounting tips, targeting users interested in business tools.

#  Why Use It:

* Wide reach (millions of websites)
* Great for visual creatives and storytelling
* Ideal for remarketing

#  Considerations:

* Lower intent audience
* Clicks may not convert unless properly targeted

#  3. Video Campaigns

#  Ideal for: Product demos, brand storytelling, YouTube visibility

Video campaigns allow you to run video ads on **YouTube** and across Google’s video partner network.

 *Example:* A 15-second video ad plays before a YouTube video about entrepreneurship.

#  Why Use It:

* Engaging content format
* Excellent for storytelling and product showcases
* Strong brand recall potential

#  Considerations:

* Requires high-quality video production
* Metrics like view-through and watch time are more useful than direct conversions

#  4. Shopping Campaigns

#  Ideal for: E-commerce and online retailers

Shopping campaigns display product ads (with images, prices, and store info) at the top of Google’s search results and in the Shopping tab.

 *Example:* Someone searches “Bluetooth headphones” and sees your product image, name, price, and store link right away.

# Why Use It:

* Highly visual, attention-grabbing
* Great for e-commerce performance
* High-intent traffic
* Considerations:

* Requires product feed via Google Merchant Center
* Best suited for businesses with an online store
* 5. Local Campaigns (Now integrated into Performance Max)

#  Ideal for: Physical stores, restaurants, or service areas

These campaigns were designed to drive store visits, calls, or local actions by showing ads across Google Maps, Search, YouTube, and Display.

 *Example:* A person nearby searches for “coffee near me” and sees your local café ad with directions.

#  Why Use It:

* Great for businesses with walk-in customers
* Connects online ads to offline action
* Auto-optimizes across Google platforms

#  Considerations:

* Requires verified Google Business Profile
* Less control over specific placements

#  6. App Campaigns

# Ideal for: App installs, in-app actions

App campaigns promote your mobile app across Google Search, Play Store, YouTube, Display Network, and more—all from a single campaign. *Example:* Your app ad shows up on YouTube and Google Play when someone watches videos related to fitness apps.

#  Why Use It:

* One campaign promotes across all channels
* Automated targeting and bidding
* Focused on driving installs and engagement

#  Considerations:

* Less creative control
* Requires solid in-app tracking setup

#  7. Performance Max Campaigns

#  Ideal for: Businesses seeking all-in-one automation and reach

**Performance Max** is Google’s latest campaign type. It combines automation with access to all of Google’s channels—Search, Display, YouTube, Gmail, Discover, and Maps—in one campaign.

 *Example:* A single campaign promotes your accounting course via search ads, YouTube bumper ads, and Gmail promotions—automatically.

#  Why Use It:

* Runs across all platforms
* Google uses machine learning to optimize for conversions
* Great for advertisers with multiple goals

# Considerations:

* Less transparency on where ads appear
* Limited manual control and data segmentation

# Final Thoughts

There’s no “one-size-fits-all” solution when it comes to Google Ads campaigns. The right type depends on **your business model, budget, and goals**. Start small, test different formats, and optimize as you go.

Remember, even the most advanced campaign can fail without a strong strategy behind it.

1ksohb7,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1ksohb7/hr_the_intruder/,[HR] The Intruder,"I live alone in a tiny apartment in Chicago, third floor, right above a laundromat that never seems to close. I’m not scared of the dark or being alone or anything—I’m 31 and I’ve seen plenty of horror movies to know what’s fake. Or at least, I thought I did.

Everything started on a Sunday night. I’d just finished watching a new horror movie on Netflix—some slow burn about a haunted forest—and I was about to go to bed. I always check my security cam before I sleep. I live in a sketchy part of town, so I’ve got one of those cheap indoor cameras facing my front door. You can access the feed from your phone, so I checked it like I always do.

This time, something was different.

There was a man standing in my hallway. Just… standing. His face was pale, like paper, and his arms were long—way too long. He didn’t move. He didn’t knock. He didn’t try to open the door. Just stood there, his head tilted slightly to the side, staring at the door. My door. I blinked hard, thinking it was a glitch, maybe a frozen frame. But when I looked again, his head turned—slowly—like he knew I was watching him.

I didn’t hear anything. No footsteps, no knocking. But the camera was live. He was there.

I stared at the screen for what felt like forever. Then I heard something from my actual apartment. A soft creak. Like a floorboard shifting under someone’s weight.

I froze. My apartment is small—kitchen, living room, one bedroom. I know every sound this place makes, and that wasn’t one of them.

I grabbed the baseball bat I keep under my bed. I didn’t want to check, but I had to. I moved slowly through the apartment, bat raised, heart thudding so loud it felt like my ribs would break. Nothing in the living room. Nothing in the kitchen. Nothing in the bathroom.

But when I got to my bedroom, I saw it.

Not him. It.

It was crouched in the corner, arms folded tight against its chest, legs bent in a way no human legs should bend. It looked at me, and I swear its mouth was too wide. Like it was smiling, but there were no teeth. Just darkness. An empty hole stretching back farther than it should’ve. I didn’t scream. I couldn’t. I just stood there, frozen, as it tilted its head the same way it had on the camera.

I ran. I don’t even remember unlocking the door. I ran out of my building, barefoot, in boxers, and didn’t stop until I reached the diner three blocks down. I sat there until morning, trying to explain what happened to the waitress. She just nodded and brought me coffee. I think she thought I was on something.

I went back with a friend the next day. Apartment was locked. No signs of forced entry. No camera footage. It had all been erased.

But last night, the app glitched again.

And when I opened the feed, the hallway was empty.

1ksoe8s,https://i.redd.it/lda7kl2gkb2f1.jpeg,Well I got my coffee post today … 👋👋👋,"I mentioned yesterday that I was ready for coffee posts and storage room confessionals .. close enough !

Their lack of interest in Art , History , exploring and Ashley actually doing something without Dino , may be part of the boring ( yet snark worthy ) entertainment of this week .   

The credit cards may need paying and health scale not selling as they had hoped also , limiting fun money. Ashley is only interested in eating and spending money .. if she can’t do that no reason to go get a picture holding up the tower if Pisa ! 

I can spend weeks on a beach with my family and only leave to get groceries and go out fishing etc . But that’s right here in the USA .. I still cannot understand not doing some things while they are there , which they may never be able to do again . This whole live life she has going on … yet they can sit and look at grass for years in TN . Venice is a train ride from Florence .. they can go for the day .. speaking of Florence , it’s nearly impossible to see in a day . 

So my thoughts are .. 

Dino has had to work . Ashley literally does nothing but Merc and two buying trips a year without him . So they stay home .

Car is gone , company caught wind of his reckless driving and had them return it . 

Airbnb or owners caught them leaving kids and said no more .

They have received backlash from more than Reddit on leaving kids , so continue to leave kids , even during the day but don’t post . 

The total insanity of not properly feeding kids , and then hitting back hard with the ignorant “ clean food”  confessionals was next level ignorant .. and more than Reddit took notice .  

Last night .. Ashley over served , acting like some famous influencer was so cringe .. she likely gathered the troops today to create sober content .. or is posting old pictures . lol . 

Insane she has gained , or bought more  followers since this trip started , but obviously has someone actually doing their job. 

As influencers go .. no one can say she has inspired them in some way . People are entertained by their ignorance .  She tags and pushes very little compared to most. I will say that is a positive .  But you can’t ignore the fake health crap with the bathroom scale .. no more seltzer ! Then show your food ignorance to 800K . 

She is walking on egg shells and holding back the full on Ashley preacher we normally would have by now … sure way to dump a few hundred followers . But she is holding on tight to the TN storyline .. buying some carved vases or bowls … planning her pizza oven , black ceilings and huge organic farm to feed her family .  All in some cheap slippers in a cold dark Italian villa . 

Ciao !!!! For us rude Americans it’s almost Friday and a long weekend approaches!!! 

Happy Snarking !!!

I don’t usually do this, but lately I’ve been craving better conversations. The kind that don’t rush to be deep but somehow still get there. The kind where a “how was your day” actually means, tell me everything, I’ve got time.

I’m looking for people who are real; who don’t perform “connection” like it’s a script, but who let it unfold like a playlist on shuffle. I don’t mind slow replies, disappearing acts, or random silence. I do it too. Life gets loud sometimes. But if we do talk, I hope it’s with intention. I hope it feels like something.

I’d love to meet people in the Philippines, but I’m open to wherever the signal reaches. Bonus if you spell your words out fully. Not because I’m a grammar snob, but because I like the rhythm of complete thoughts. I like people who mean what they say, even if it’s just about a dream they had last night or a snack they’re currently obsessed with.

As [Gaston Cuny](https://investx.fr/en/author/gaston_cuny/), writer at InvestX, said himself.

[Link to the article](https://investx.fr/en/crypto-news/top-3-memecoins-bonk-popcat-kendu/)

Recently, $KENDU has been mentioned in this article besides two big names in the memecoin scene:

* $BONK: $423 million market cap
* $POPCAT: $1.7 billion market cap

If you compare these marketcaps with $KENDU, which is sitting at $32 million as we speak, KENDU has a lot of upwards potential! In June 2024, $KENDU reach its all time high of $286 million marketcap. From the levels we are at right now, that is a solid +700%. I'd say open your agenda and look at the date, next month is June.. 👀

**This is what Gaston wrote down about $KENDU:**

>**KENDU** has emerged as one of the top-performing memecoins this week, showing an impressive **99%** increase, although the pace has slightly slowed over the past 24 hours. Holderscan data shows that over 68% of **KENDU** holders own more than $10 worth of tokens, reflecting strong investor confidence in the future potential of this token.

>If KENDU manages to secure **$0.00003063** as support, it could leverage the positive market signals to surpass **$0.00004246**, or even reach **$0.00005042**. However, if selling pressure outweighs the bullish sentiment, a drop below **$0.00003063** could lead to a decline to **$0.00001919**. Such a development would challenge the positive outlook and indicate further **downside potential** for KENDU.

There is a reason Gaston mentioned KENDU, the community is putting in real work! Let me give you a few examples.

**Kendu Games: AAA Dev Comes Out of Retirement**

This is the biggest news. [Coop](https://x.com/WhatDidCoopSay), a community member, is now launching a legitimate game studio under the $KENDU umbrella, named; Kendu Games. Not a half-baked crypto game or a easy cash-grab. A full-scale traditional RPG, with serious developers. The lead dev? A former triple AAA game developer and BioWare veteran who worked on Dragon Age, Mass Effect, and Baldur’s Gate. He literally came out of retirement for this, purely because he believes in what Kendu is doing. The plan is to create a Skyrim-style RPG, followed by a roguelite later. No crypto gimmicks in the gameplay. But the kicker is that game profits will be used to buy Kendu tokens and fund the community. Here's a small breakdown, from all the profits 10% will go into a Kendu Games Business treasury and 5% will be donated to the Kendu Community wallet. let's say they hit one million copies sold, which is likely to happen, that’s an estimated $1.6 million in buy pressure for Kendu. That’s just from one game.

[Kendu Games X Profile](https://x.com/KenduGames)

[Kendu Games Teaser](https://reddit.com/link/1kso7ji/video/49ke17q9ib2f1/player)

**Decentralized Brand, Real-World Impact**

Kendu isn’t just building in digital spaces. The brand is exploding in the real world too. Members of the community have launched Kendu Coffee, Kendu Energy Drinks, Kendu Vodka, Kendu Nights (club promotions), and even Kendu Esports, a League of Legends team. What makes this different from every other project? It’s all permissionless. Anyone can build under the Kendu brand without needing to ask for approval. There is no centralized entity handing out licenses. This is decentralized brand ownership in action.

[KENDU Energy Drink Promo](https://reddit.com/link/1kso7ji/video/73t9azlbib2f1/player)

**""We Don’t Gamble, We Work""**

This has become the core philosophy of Kendu. The project isn’t about flipping tokens or hoping for pumps. It’s about showing up and putting in the work. Token holders treat Kendu like a startup. There are daily goals, power hours, and people grinding social content and launching real-life products. The Kendu community is working, not speculating.

**No Paid Hype, No Insiders**

One of the most refreshing parts of Kendu is how it’s grown. There are no paid influencers, no whales with insider allocations, and no VC dumping risk. Everyone buys with their own money. Everyone contributes with their own effort. It’s raw, organic, and surprisingly effective. The project has reached over 18,000 holders this way. Not through hype, but through work.

**Wormhole Bridge: Building for the Long Game**

Kendu has also quietly launched bridges to the Solana and Base chains. This wasn’t a PR stunt or hype strategy. It was a tactical move, preparing for the moment when momentum returns. The goal is simple: dominate the top gainers list across multiple chains in the long term. This kind of forward-thinking infrastructure sets Kendu apart from typical meme coins. And the cool addition to this; let's say Solana moves up in price? This will automatically drive the price of $KENDU without any added buy pressure.

[$KENDU Available on 3 Chains](https://preview.redd.it/8plhz5ydib2f1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6b3f4117037ef88c33d4bc47161e0a79325e9d2b)

**TL;DR**

$KENDU was recently mentioned alongside big names like $BONK and $POPCAT, but its market cap is still much smaller, a very high ROI from these levels. A former AAA game developer is making a full RPG for Kendu, and profits from the game will be used to buy KENDU tokens. The community is also creating real products like Kendu Coffee and Energy Drinks. There are no paid influencers or big investors, just people working hard together. Bullish on $KENDU.

1kso417,https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1kso417/reducing_stimulant_effects_at_bedtime/,Reducing stimulant effects at bedtime.,"I recently noticed my deep sleep and sleep latency have been quite poor. Often getting just 30 minutes of deep sleep a night. I tend to wake up feeling not quite well-rested, although also not insanely tired. I think it might have to do with caffeine and Ritalin. 

I maintain good sleep hygiëne, putting my phone away at 9pm, reading for a bit and going to bed, with earplugs and a sleep mask for darkness and silence. I run most days of the week. I take magnesium, and usually drink a cup of chamomille.
No alcohol on weekdays.

I’m starting to feel like stimulants might play a role.
I used to drink 2-4 espresso’s a day, but never later than 2pm. And I’m prescribed Ritalin (methylphenidate IR), taking a max of 20mg (usually 10 or 15) a day, with the last dose no later than 2pm.  

I cut that back, drinking 2 coffee’s max, no later than 12pm, and no Ritalin after 12:30. 
It’s definitely helped a bit, but I tend to still feel ever so slightly stimulated around bedtime. My HR isn’t elevated (much) and it’s not like I *just* took it, but..
I don’t feel like I do when I don’t take any stimulants at all. Even though, according to the half life it should be mostly out of my system.

I just feel the tiniest bit stimulated/anxious, and it’s reflected in my sleep quality.  

Has anyone else struggled with this? 

What I tried already:
Melatonin: makes me groggy, and tends to lead me on a cycle of increasing coffee and stimulants to combat it, leading to poorer sleep. 
Other sleep inducing herbs like valerian, lemon balm or ashwagandha: both help with sleep, valerian especially increases deep sleep but suffer negative effects on the long term. 

Other supplements I take:
D3 (3k IU)
Magnesium (150mg)
Zinc on occasion.

1kso3eg,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthMomentum/comments/1kso3eg/discover_why_natures_way_fortify_probiotic_review/,Discover Why Nature's Way Fortify Probiotic Review Stands Out for Digestive Health,"The Nature's Way 11582 Fortify Extra Strength Probiotic has been a staple of my daily routine for the past few weeks, and as someone who’s quite particular about health supplements, I knew I had to dive deep into this one. Designed for adults over 50, this probiotic supplement boasts 50 billion CFUs, 11 diverse probiotic strains, and plant-based prebiotic fiber. With digestive health, colon health, and immune support listed as its main promises, I was curious if it could live up to the hype.

**Design and Packaging**

The first thing that caught my eye was the product’s packaging. It comes in a sturdy, compact bottle sealed tightly, making it not only easy to store but also travel-friendly. The packaging claims that no refrigeration is required, which is a big plus for anyone who doesn’t want to rearrange their fridge to accommodate supplements. I’ve left it on my kitchen counter for weeks, and it has remained just as effective as promised. The pills themselves are fairly small capsules, making them easy to swallow—definitely worth noting for those who struggle with larger supplement sizes.  

[Check Nature's Way 11582 Fortify Extra Strength Probiotic price on Amazon.](https://healthquay.com/p/b00099qqim/)  

**Efficacy and Results**

I started noticing subtle changes within the first week of use. My digestive discomfort, often triggered by certain foods, noticeably lessened, and regularity improved to the point where I didn’t even need coffee to feel “awake” in the mornings anymore. The inclusion of plant-based prebiotic fiber distinguishes this product since many probiotics don’t consider feeding the good bacteria already in your gut. It’s evident that the blend of 11 different strains was carefully selected to cater to the complex needs of an aging digestive system. While I’m not yet in my 50s, both my parents—who fall into the target demographic—tested it as well and reported almost identical results. My dad specifically mentioned how he felt more energetic throughout the day. However, it’s worth noting that the changes weren’t instantaneous. Patience is essential in letting the probiotics do their magic.  

**Usage and Convenience**

Being a daily supplement, convenience plays a huge role here. The instructions recommend just one pill a day, which can be taken with or without food. I’ve tried both methods, and I didn’t notice a difference in its effectiveness. The fact that it doesn’t need refrigeration makes it easy to stick to the routine since there were no extra steps involved in its upkeep. Plus, the lack of dairy, soy, artificial colors, and extra additives further simplified my decision to keep using it. This gluten-free design has made it equally suitable for some of my friends with dietary sensitivities.

**Good Points**

- Includes 11 diverse probiotic strains tailored for adults 50+.
- Features plant-based prebiotic fiber to boost the efficacy of the probiotics.  
- Capsules are small, easy to swallow, and don’t carry an unpleasant taste.
- Certified gluten-free, non-GMO, and free from soy and dairy.  
- No need for refrigeration, adding to its convenience for on-the-go lifestyles.  

**Critiques**

- While effective, results take a few weeks to show; not ideal if you’re looking for immediate changes.
- The probiotic’s effects may vary depending on pre-existing gut health issues.  
- A slightly higher price compared to some other probiotic options on the market.

**Alternative Offerings**

Probiotics are everywhere in the health and supplement industry, so naturally, I’ve tried others in the past, like Garden of Life Raw Probiotics and Renew Life Ultimate Flora. What sets the Nature's Way product apart for me is the specific formulation for adults over 50, combined with prebiotic fiber. Garden of Life is another high-quality brand, but the capsules are larger, and the probiotic strains are less targeted, making them feel like a blanket solution rather than a specialized one. Renew Life, on the other hand, does compete quite well in terms of probiotic strains but lacks the convenience of no refrigeration. Based on my experiences, the versatility and focus on older adults make this product a better tailored option.

**Price to Quality Ratio**

While it’s slightly costlier than generic probiotics, the quality and attention to detail here justify the investment. Between the comprehensive strain profile and the inclusion of prebiotic fiber, you’re essentially paying for a dual-action product. How many other probiotics can confidently state they provide nourishment for existing gut flora and enhance digestive regularity at the same time? For those seeking targeted benefits and trustworthy quality standards, this option feels worth every penny spent.

Ever find yourself staring at your to-do list like it’s some kind of insurmountable mountain? You know, the one that brings on that sinking feeling as you scroll through a never-ending list of tasks? 😩 I used to get so tangled up in my thoughts that I’d often spend more time planning than actually doing anything. Can anyone else relate?

But then, I decided to shake things up. Instead of letting that list paralyze me, I decided to *gamify* the whole process. 🎮 Game on, my friends! Here’s how I went from analysis paralysis to ACTUAL launch:

**🎯 Step 1: Create Quests, Not Tasks**  
You know how in video games, you have quests that lead you to the ultimate goal? I transformed my boring to-do list into a series of quests! Here’s what I did:

- **Main Quest:** Launch my project (e.g., website, blog, whatever)
- **Side Quests:** 
  - Research competitors
  - Design my first draft
  - Write that killer intro
- **Bonus Quests:** 
  - Engage with 5 people in my niche
  - Share a fun meme related to my topic

Suddenly, each task felt like an adventure rather than a chore! 🎉 Who doesn’t want to be a hero on a quest?

**🎮 Step 2: Set Up Rewards**  
You know how you get that awesome loot in games for completing tasks? Yup, I did the same! Here's what I implemented:

- **Level Up:** Each completion of a quest got me closer to a self-set reward: a movie night, a fancy coffee, or even a mini shopping spree.
- **Achievement Badges:** I even made up some silly badges for myself. “Procrastination Slayer” and “Deadline Dodger” became my self-awarded titles. 😂

**🌟 Step 3: Invite a Crew**  
All great adventures need a team, right? I brought in a buddy who was also struggling with motivation. We became each other’s accountability partners, cheering each other on and calling each other out when we slacked off. 💪

- We’d share progress weekly (yes, there were sometimes tears and laughter).
- We set mini-challenges. Whoever completed a task first got a free coffee from the other!

**🕹️ Step 4: Embrace the Power of “Done”**  
Perfectionism? Nah. I decided that “done” was better than “perfect.” More often than not, what we’re striving to perfect is really just a trap of analysis paralysis. By committing to getting something *out there* instead of worrying about how it looked, I made real progress. 

Here’s what I found:

- **Launch Day was Epic**: I finally hit that “publish” button, and it felt SO good. 
- **Feedback is a Gift**: Once I launched, the feedback started pouring in, which was way more helpful than sitting in my head, gathering dust!

I’m not saying I’m cured of analysis paralysis forever. But gamifying my to-do list gave me the nudge I needed to break the chains of overthinking.

Decided to get a hotel and explore the city on my long layover, flew from LAX on China Eastern Airlines. Everything about the flight was fine! Entertainment system was a bit subpar but I downloaded movies on my devices.

Pretty sure I was eligible for a free hotel, but I had already booked my room and was content with the location and price. No clue what hotels would be available for free, but I wanted to be close to the city center.

I landed at 5:15pm and got to my hotel around 7:45pm. Booked my hotel and car service through trip.com - the car to Nanjing Road area was less than $30USD; highly recommend.

I didn’t realize that iPhone 16 Pros aren’t compatible with eSIMS (I tried Arialo and Yesim - neither was able to be used with my device), so I hastily downloaded 2 VPNs before my flight and hoped for the best.

I get international coverage through Verizon, turned on roaming when I landed, and used Mullad VPN. Was able to access Instagram, Google, etc. with no issue. Can’t speak to whether it was because of the VPN or the iPhone or Verizon, but I didn’t want to take chances so I over prepared.

I downloaded AliPay, WeChat, DiDi, and Amap before the trip. Used AliPay at the Yuyuan Garden tourist market and walked around, filled up at the food stalls, then checked out the bund observation area by booking cars through DiDi.

I didn’t realize you paid after the trip was complete so I may have pissed off a taxi driver. Went home after they shut the lights off in the Bund area promptly at 11pm.

Got up early the next day to get my things together and headed to Anfu road area, again, using DiDi. It rained nearly the whole time, but it wasn’t cold and I didn’t want to buy an umbrella just for a few hours of use.

Got an excellent coffee at Baker and Spice to kill time before the stores opened. A few food stalls were open early as well. LOOKNOW, Tagi, and everything else seemed to open up around 10am. Headed back to the hotel around 11:15 to check out before my flight.

I left for my 3:25pm flight at 12pm, which may be cutting it a bit close for some people, but security was efficient and I had plenty of time to wait at the gate.

I suspect that because I was there just after the May holidays (Golden Week? Labor Day? idk) that things were much less crowded than usual.

Overall, it was a cool experience. Most people were nice. A few spoke broken English, which was a nice surprise. I got by with a few basic phrases, hand gestures, and Google translate.

I’d love to go back and experience more of the nightlife scene with friends or meet other foreigners passing through one day.

Edit: I waited to get a universal power adapter until I got to Shanghai. There was a desk selling eSIMs and I bought one for $12USD instead of paying $30-50 back home - it worked perfectly! ",1,1747912377.0,travelchina,0,1.0,False

Hey, MaximizeMe crew! 👋

Let me hit you with a question: What if you had a secret weapon to crush your day? Something that sets you apart and makes everything just a bit easier? 🤯

For me, it’s my **“Morning Brightness Ritual.”** 🌅 Sounds fancy, right? But it’s just a simple routine that keeps me motivated and energized. Here’s what I do:

1. **Hydrate, hydrate, hydrate!** 💧  
   First thing I do? Drink *a whole glass of water*. It’s like giving my brain a jumpstart. Plus, I swear it helps my skin glow (or maybe that’s just wishful thinking).

2. **Get moving!** 🕺  
   Whether it’s a quick 10-minute dance party in my living room or a brisk walk outside, I’m all about getting the blood pumpin’. The endorphins just have a way of flipping my mood like a switch!

3. **Mindfulness for a minute.** 🧘  
   I take a *full minute* to inhale, exhale, and just reflect on what I’m grateful for. It reminds me that even on the tough days, there’s always something shining through. *Bonus: It helps me focus on what really matters.*

4. **Set my day with intention.** 🎯  
   I jot down *three things I want to accomplish* that day, big or small. Sometimes it’s as simple as “Drink more water” (ironic, right?). It gives me a sense of direction.

5. **Fuel up!** 🍽️  
   A wholesome breakfast is a must. For me, it’s usually oatmeal with fruit, because who doesn’t love a warm hug in a bowl? 🌈

But here’s the kicker: This routine doesn’t just *power up my mornings.* It creates a domino effect throughout my day! I'm more focused, relaxed, and gosh, I actually enjoy what I’m doing.

So, what about you all? Do you have that one *standout habit* that feels like your unfair advantage? Something that supercharges your productivity or lifts your spirits? Maybe it’s your unique spin on morning coffee or a hilarious podcast that cracks you up on the way to work. ☕️📻

Life can be a bit of a rollercoaster, but sharing what works for us can help us all level up. Can’t wait to hear your strategies! 🙌💪",1,1747912375.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

1ksnzkc,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChilluminatiPod/comments/1ksnzkc/this_is_the_most_control_ive_had_in_a_lucid_dream/,This is the most control I've had in a lucid dream since high school!,"Hey guys. Big fan of the pod. First time writer. If you decide to share this on the show I'd be thrilled. After last night I'm pretty thrilled already. 

To give some background, I've had a major interest in dreams since highschool and for my senior thesis (class of 09) I kept a diligent dream journal and studied how to lucid dream with mixed results. In my adult life I'm an extremely vivid dreamer and usually my dreams are pretty chill. Usually they involve exploring cities or urban settings and my absolute worst dreams are usually just annoying and involve getting lost or stuck somewhere. 

Anyway. Here's the dream I had last night:

I was being driven to the airport by a friend. On the exit ramp, there was a very boring car accident. Picture flipping the warthog on blood gulch. No injuries. No damage. I'm fact there were no other cars and when we flipped, we just popped out of the car like *shoop*.  In my waking life I play a ton of video games and it seeps into my dreams to the point that it's become one of my reality checks. We wrecked on a grassy knoll (Alex 😏), and the off-ramp that we bailed from looked more like a track piece from a Trackmania™ game than a real piece of roadway infrastructure. The buildings around me looked almost like a corridor from Roboquest. Suddenly it dawned on me that my Vidya fried brain was having a dream. 

Usually in the past when I tried to control my dreams I try to use too much brain power and I either wake up or nothing happens. For instance if I try to reshape my dream from scratch I'll wake up, or if I try to fly, it just won't work. So this time I decide to take it slow. I tell my friend who just wrecked their car ""come on, were going to get coffee"". And think to myself ""when we go around the corner there's going to be a Dunk'n Donuts."" And like a god damned sorcerer, my thoughts were reality. We entered the building and the interior looked a lot like a brewery. As in there were lots of tanks and pipes running all over the place. Not to mention a long line of people waiting for their orders. This worried me because another common theme in my dreams is that whenever I order food, the dream stalls and the dream food never comes. So I focus my thoughts and walked up the the person at the end of the line. 

I stood in front of them, looked them in the eye, met their gaze and spoke the words: "" poop your pants"". Their expression changed to surprised, then worried, then horrified, then embarrassed. Their arms went behind them as if to cover up and they quickly waddled out the door. I went to the next person in line and said to them: ""poop your pants"" and my poop spell worked flawlessly yet again. I did this until there were no people left in line and I ordered for my friend and I who were served our drinks immediately. Presumably because they knew I was a powerful poop sorcerer and they didn't want to anger me. After this, my lucidity finally faded and I merged back into regular dream consciousness, as well as losing most of my dream memory after that. Although I do have a vague recollection of making a few more people dump ass. 

I told my roommate about it in the morning. Unfortunately I didn't get to keep my shit powers because when I tried it out on him it didn't seem to work. Or maybe he was just being coy. Oh well. I'll be sure to follow up if I have any more lucid dreams as good as this. Although this will be hard to top. ",1,1747912157.0,ChilluminatiPod,0,1.0,False

Your normal day tends to be someone else’s worst. The past thirty years have given me plenty of rewarding days and just as many awful ones. I have held dead babies, arrested young men who would spend decades behind bars, and consoled families of accident victims. The years have aged me quicker than I would like to admit, but I cannot seem to stay away. Well, I *couldn’t* stay away. 



I am retiring next week. The girls in the office already ordered my cake and my papers have been processed. If you would have asked me two years ago when I was going to retire, I would have laughed and told you when My grandkids were old enough to take over the position. 



My life two years ago seems so distant now. Thanksgiving of 2022 was the day my world flipped upside down. Since then, it has only been a decent down into whatever you want to call this. Is it madness? Is it despair? I can’t really tell anymore. 



I believe the only way to truly get through this is to put it on paper. This story must be told. You may read this and agree that I am crazy or unfit to remain sheriff. I just hope someone out there can believe what I say and learn from what happened here. So, I am going to start with the events of Thanksgiving morning,  the last time I felt whole.

  


It had been raining since before dawn. The sun was lazy and remained hidden behind a curtain of dense gray clouds. The air was cold and wet. Once crisp and colorful leaves were now soggy and brown, stuck to the payment. The faint smell of burning logs traveled throughout the neighborhood as smoke bellowed from chimneys. The streets were empty, yet to feel the weight of full vehicles traveling house to house. Those citizens of Dove Hill who were not traveling were in their warm homes, preparing pies and putting stuffed turkeys into ovens. 



I found myself and over a half dozen other deputies standing in the rain, in front of Don Jennings’ house. I stood with a few other deputies by my patrol car. I had been the Sheriff of Dove Hill for ten years; having served Frankford County for three decades - minus a brief stint with the Georgia State Patrol in the early 2000’s. I was born and raised in Dove Hill; Don Jennings was my best friend. 



I lifted the brim of my hat and scratched my head while looking down at the puddle beneath my boots. The cold rain drops ran down my back. I stood and stared up at Don’s house then back to my deputies. They were standing behind me with their hands in their pockets. After another ten seconds, I knew we had to go up there. Stalling would only delay the inevitable. 



“Okay. Rogers, you and Miller head around the back. Thompson and Everett, they’ll be with me on the porch. I want the rest of y’all behind patrol cars. In case shit hits the fan, which I know won’t happen, I need men on standby to call for backup.” I made sure to look up at all of my deputies as I spoke. The deputies nodded and went their separate ways, as directed. 



I was still in disbelief that I had the entire sheriff's department parked in front of Don’s house. Only an hour before I had been in my recliner drinking a hot cup of coffee while my wife Edna snapped green beans at the table singing to Marvin Gaye. In fact, we had been talking about Don that morning. 



I knew this was all one big clusterfuck of a misunderstanding and Don and I would laugh about it on one of our weekends on the lake- eventually. No, he had not seen Don in a few weeks, but he was sick. Sadie, Don’s daughter, had been checking in on him. He was just having a rough time, it was getting closer to Christmas. Since Shirly had been gone, Don't always had a hard time during the holidays. That was all, Don was not feeling well and just needed to be alone for a bit - and he probably didn’t want to pass a cold to the baby. That was all. This was all a misunderstanding and just Don keeping to himself. That was all. 



I slowly walked along Don’s truck, gently touching the hood to feel if it was warm- it was stone cold. I turned to the two deputies behind me and motioned for them to follow. I figured I'd bring the two rookies, or pole beans, as I called them, with me to the porch. Neither Thompson or Everett had been on the force for more than 6 months; they were barely above drinking age. I had practically known them their whole lives. They were the most nervous about the ordeal. 



Dove Hill was a small, quiet town; the most action majority of the deputies had seen up to this point was the occasional domestic violence call or public intoxication. The three of us slowly crept up the porch steps. The air was now still, and the sound of each step creaking may as well have been alarms all going off in sequence. I turned and gave the two deputies a reassuring smile and nod to ease their nerves somewhat. While I continued to tell myself this was all going to chalk up to nothing, I could feel my heartbeat in my temples now. I was beginning to feel tiny, soft butterflies flutter in my gut, like they were just waking from a long sleep.



 I knocked on the front door three times, then stood back. Silence. After about 10 seconds, I leaned forward with three more taps, this time a little harder. I turned back and smiled at the two bean poles. Nothing.



 “Hey, Don!” I yelled hesitantly. “Don, it’s Sam- Sheriff Meadows. I’m just here to ask you a few questions bud'' 



Still, no response. No sounds. No movement. No shuffling. Nothing. 



I reluctantly reached for the knob. “DON! IMMA HAVE TO LET MYSELF IN.” The door was unlocked and opened without protest. I quietly opened the door and crept inside. We were met with the smell of spoiled food. The young deputies behind me both covered their noses immediately, Thompson let out a muffled gag through his sleeve. Dozens of fat flies rested on the walls.



 “Don, it’s Sam. It’s alright, I just have a few deputies with me. We need to ask you a few questions then we’ll be outta your hair.” 



I found my wrist under my nose now. As we cautiously made our way further into the dark living room, the smell grew worse and the flies began to stir. The deep, almost chant-like humming sound that filled the room became louder and more erratic as the heavy flies buzzed throughout the room. I had to begin swatting them away as they flew into my face. I was about to enter the kitchen when something caught my eye. 



Now, I had known Don since we were children. Being one of the few black children in a recently desegregated school in 1970s Georgia had its challenges. I was bullied and called names by students and hardly ever invited to birthday parties or play-dates. That was all until I met Don. He and his parents were welcoming and did not treat me any differently. Don’s mother, Kathy was incredibly sweet and up until her passing in 2010 always referred to me as one of her kids. Mine and Don’s friendship was solid and grew throughout the years as we did.



We were best men at each other's weddings, our wives became best friends, we raised kids together, fished on weekends, and shared our ups and downs. We grieved together as we lost our parents, I and Edna leaned on Don and Shirly when our oldest son died, and Don leaned on us when his wife passed five years ago. There were many nights Don and I helped pull each other from the depths of heartache. I would be lying if I said Don hadn’t saved my life a time or two- and I his. 



As I looked around the living room that hosted our memories, I still struggled to comprehend why I was there. If only this were a larger town or I *wasn’t the damn sheriff* I would have been able to sit this one out. I know, it sounds cowardly, but I was conflicted and the word *confused* did not even begin to describe the jumbled thoughts racing through my mind at that moment. 



When I turned my attention to the figure in the dining room, I did not see Don. I saw someone *else.* The Don Jennings I knew was clean shaved and friendly. He was a Christian and genuinely tried to be as Christ-like as he could. Now we all have our demons and Don had his fair share, but he simply loved people. He was *good.* 



The man I saw that morning was unkempt. The smell of rotten food began to mingle with the putrid smell of body odor and urine. He looked disheveled. As I turned toward him and began to walk his way, I noticed his Smith & Wesson laying on the table in front of him. That .44 Magnum was Don’s favorite gun; he had bought it at an auction just before his daughter graduated high school. I stared at the gun for a brief moment and thought back to the dark April night I had to talk Don out of eating it shortly after Shirly’s accident. 



In that moment the realization that something was terribly wrong hit me like a truck. I wouldn’t be able to fix this- fix him. The butterflies in my stomach had not turned into a pit with no bottom. My heart and stomach were practically playing hop-scotch with one another. 



“Whoa, Don. I didn’t see you there.” I said as I slowly pivoted towards the table. My hand now on my holster, moves were now strategic and calculated. “Whatcha doin’ sittin’ here in the dark man?” 



I wiped the salty sweat from my face. 



Don looked up at me, he was not a very large man. Don was average in build, late fifties. He was not an intimidating man, and I never knew him to try and be. But now, in the moment, the Don Jennings I knew, the Don Jennings who defended me against skinheads in the school, the Don Jennings who gave his only daughter away to my son ten years ago, was gone. His eyes were vacant and glassy, almost shining against the dark. He had fresh scabs on his face, they looked like healing scratches. He smiled ear to ear. 



“Sam! I am so happy you are here on this beautiful morning!”



 His graying hair was wet, sticking to his forehead, making it return to its familiar brown hue. He looked like he hadn’t showered in a week. 



“Don, I haven't seen you in a few weeks. Not since Halloween- were you sick? What’s the matter Don?” My head was cocked, trying to examine the strange man in front of me. 



“Sam- I, I” Don began to lift his hands in glory and almost laugh; it was like he was giddy. “I must share the good news with you! Oh, it’s ju-just marvelous Sam!” He was acting childlike, or as if he was freshly home from a tent revival.



 “Okay Don, that’s great. How about, we go down to the station and you tell me there. I would love to hear it, and I’m sure Sadie would be so glad to see you today, after all, it is Thanksgiving. She’s been worried sick about ya.” I flickered my eyes down to the gun, back at Don.



I was slowly closing the gap between Don and I, smiling and gently motioning him to stand up. I was aware of the gun's place on the table and without breaking eye contact now, I slowly reached for it. 



Don’s eyes lit up while he listened. “Sadie? Oh, yes! Will Marcus and the kids be there too, Sam?” 



“Yes, yes they will.” I lied.



 At this moment, Don broke eye contact long enough to see my fingertips closing in on the gun. He quickly grabbed the gun and yanked it towards his body “No Sam! No! '' he spat, standing up. His eyes lost their sparkle for a split second, and they almost looked black. “No! You will not take her from me!”



 For a moment I could have sworn Don was foaming from the mouth as he screamed. His joyous expression was gone, his face turned red, jowls shaking as he screamed. 



I recoiled and grabbed my holster. “Don, I’m- I’m sorry. I just didn’t want you to hurt yourself man.” 



The two pole beans nearly jumped back, their thin arms at their sides, fingers trembling over their holsters as well.



 As quickly as it left, the sparkle came back and Don threw his head back in manic laughter.



 “No Sam, you're mistaken. She won’t hurt me or do anything I don’t want.” He stroked the barrel of the gun, running his fingertips over the cylinder. He held the revolver gently, with care. “Sit! Come on, sit down so I can finally share the good news!” Don gleefully dropped back into his chair. He looked at the two terrified deputies behind me. “Sit boys! Sit!” His smile was so wide it looked painful. 



I looked at the other deputies and the two on the back porch. I subtly shook my head, I needed more time alone before the rest of the men barged in. I knew Rogers had called for backup soon as he heard Don yell. I sat down in the chair across from Don, gun now in my hand under the table. 



“Don, I’m afraid there is an issue- something has happened. I would really like to go down to the station and-”



 “I saw God, Sam.” Don interrupted. “I saw Him, and Shirly was with Him! They came to me a few months ago Sam!” He rocked back and forth, as if the excitement was too much to keep inside.



 My heart was in my throat. 



 “And Sam, He- He told me things…He told me I was the chosen one Sam!” Don began to giggle again, he was hysterical. “I am doing His work and cleansing the Earth!” Don was speaking faster than Sam had ever heard him speak. “Do you hear me Sam?! Sam- I was chos-” 



“STOP!” I didn’t mean to yell, but for the first time in a while, I felt fear. I felt that familiar, sinking feeling in my gut; the same damn feeling I felt when I saw Sam Jr hit the collapse on the football field all those years ago. It was the feeling of dread. It was the feeling that you know that things are *not* going to be okay, no matter how much you pray for them to be. The truth of the matter was, he had done what he was suspected of, and possibly more. My eyes filled with burning tears, I wiped them away before turning my  attention back to Don. 



“No! Sam, I- You need to understand me. I am serving the *LORD!* And He is so happy with me Sam! He is so happy! But, I have been told this morning that my work is done here and I need to go be with Shirly and the Lord.” Don pleaded, drool began to escape his lips. 



“Don, ju-just slow down. I need the gun.” I reached out, my hands were shaking. “Please, just don’t do anything crazy. Think about Sadie, think about the kids.”



 Don shook his head and began to position the barrel under his chin and grunt. “No Sam, I’m not. This isn’t crazy at all, this is- this is what he needs me to do. This is my mission Sam. I, I-” Don had a firm grip on the gun, as his chin rested on the muzzle. Don had become a bizarre combination of manic yet totally calm, panicked yet free.



 Don looked at me, his smile softened. “Sam, I have completed my mission. I’m going home now.” Don closed his eyes and cocked the gun. In that instant, I sprung up from my chair and grabbed Don’s wrist, thrusting it to the side. 



Don squeezed the trigger. 



The blast echoed throughout the house. I fell back into my chair. The bullet had traveled up the side of Don’s face and exited his head from a giant hole it had created above his left brow. Blood, teeth, bone fragments and brain matter covered my uniform and the ceiling. Don’s body slumped over in his chair, then slowly fell out onto the floor where a dark puddle formed around him. Wisps of smoke exited the newly formed hole in his head.



 I fell from the chair and to my knees, eyes wide. I looked up at the two deputies; Everett’s pants were soaked with urine as he stood staring at Don’s lifeless body. I looked back down at the puddle of thick blood under my knees now; it was so dark. No more than a second later, the back and front doors were busted open. Deputies rushing in, guns drawn. The dining room was suddenly filled with so much noise and chaos. But I couldn't hear a damn thing. I just sat on the floor covered in Don. I think I was too stunned to fully realize what had just happened, as I shifted my body, now sitting in the puddle. It all just happened too damn fast.

I'm always up for going places and chatting away to all sorts of people and it's no exaggeration to say I have friends all over the world.

My voice is my best feature and I'm always happy to voice verify that I'm real through the Vocaroo website. I'd like you to do the same in return because I can't see pictures very well. Also you might have an attractive voice and I want to hear it. Yes I do have a Scottish accent but I think you'll understand me just fine.

Making friends is perfectly acceptable and that's where I'd like to start every time but ultimately we all know why many of us are here . Looking for some casual fun but open to a relationship. I prefer the softness of a plus sized woman but it is just a preference. A cosy woman of any size is welcome to message if this all appeals. I adore cuddles and snuggles. If you've ever been told that your need for physical touch and affection is ""too much"", turn it up a lot and I'll meet you half way., I prefer to take quiet charge in our most lovely moments so I hope you enjoy that. If we do end up in a relationship, I want the Works. Marriage, kids etc but let's walk before we can run though and maybe a casual thing is all it will be.

Science Says It’s Not Entirely Your Fault…,"Ever had one of those days where you’re fully committed to being a couch goblin? Like, even thinking about moving feels exhausting? Turns out, your DNA might be low-key trolling you.

So here’s the deal. Evolution wired us to crave “natural rewards” (food, sex, Netflix binges… wait, scratch that last one). But weirdly, exercise is also supposed to trigger those feel-good vibes. Yep, your brain releases dopamine during a killer workout, just like when you crush a pizza. But why do some people chase that runner’s high while others would rather die than leave the couch?

Scientists did this wild experiment with mice. They bred two groups: one that loved running on wheels and one that basically said, “nah, I’m good.” After a few generations, the “marathon mice” were running 7 miles a day compared to the lazy squad’s 4. Their brains? Packed with bigger dopamine systems. Translation: they were genetically addicted to moving. Take away their wheel, and they’d get cranky like a coffee-deprived barista.

Turns out, humans might have a “couch-potato gene” too. There’s a dopamine receptor gene that, if mutated, makes chilling way more appealing than hustling. So if you’ve ever blamed your laziness on your parents… you’re not totally wrong.

BUT—before you use this as an excuse to skip leg day forever—genes aren’t destiny. Environment matters. Maybe you grew up in a “video games > hiking” household, or your gym trauma started in middle school dodgeball. The point is, you can rewire your brain. Start small: dance while microwaving leftovers, take stairs like you’re in a dramatic movie montage. Your dopamine system will eventually catch on.

Your laziness isn’t all your fault—blame genetics. But you can still fight your DNA. Now go pet your dog or something.",5,1747911471.0,selfimprovement,3,0.73,False
1ksnsa7,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoCodeCommunity/comments/1ksnsa7/free_web_hosting_for_students/,Free Web Hosting For Students,"# Let's be honest - being a student is tough financially. Between textbooks that cost more than your rent, ramen noodles becoming a food group, and finding creative ways to afford basically everything, the last thing you need is another expense when you're trying to build your online presence.

I remember my own college days, staring at hosting prices that seemed astronomical when my entire monthly budget could fit in a coffee cup. But here's the thing: building a website as a student isn't just about showcasing your work - it's about **creating opportunities that can change your entire career trajectory**.

Whether you're a computer science major needing to display your coding projects, an art student building a portfolio, or an aspiring entrepreneur testing your first business idea, having a professional web presence has become absolutely essential. The good news? You don't need to choose between eating and having a website.

# Why Students Need Web Hosting More Than Ever 🚀

The digital landscape has fundamentally shifted how we present ourselves professionally. Gone are the days when a paper resume was enough to land your dream internship or first job. Today's employers expect to see your work online, and your digital portfolio often serves as your first impression.

Consider this: web hosting for students typically costs between $1.99 and $10.00 per month, but the return on investment can be enormous. That portfolio site you build today could land you an internship worth thousands of dollars next semester.

**Students who benefit most from having their own websites include:**

* **Computer Science & Web Development students** showcasing coding projects and GitHub repositories
* **Design and Art majors** displaying creative portfolios and visual work
* **Business students** testing entrepreneurial ideas and building personal brands
* **Marketing majors** demonstrating campaign work and analytics skills
* **Journalism students** creating professional writing portfolios and blogs
* **Photography students** showcasing their best work in high resolution

The reality is that students have two solid options when it comes to web hosting: Use an always-free hosting plan, which will have significant limitations, or use a cheap web hosting plan that comes with everything you need for a quality hosting experience. Let's explore both paths thoroughly.

# The True Cost of ""Free"" Hosting: What You Need to Know 💰

Before diving into specific providers, let's address the elephant in the room. **Free hosting isn't actually free** \- you're paying with limitations, ads, and sometimes your sanity.

# Common Limitations of Free Hosting:

|Limitation|Impact on Students|Workaround Options|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Storage restrictions** (1-5GB)|Can't upload high-res portfolio images|Optimize images, use external CDN|
|**Bandwidth limits** (1-50GB/month)|Site may go offline during traffic spikes|Monitor usage, upgrade when needed|
|**No custom domain**|Less professional appearance|Use subdomain creatively|
|**Forced advertising**|Distracts from your content|Choose ad-free providers|
|**Limited support**|You're on your own when things break|Build technical skills, use forums|

That said, free web hosting typically offers limited resources compared to paid services, but if you're ready to make the leap to paid hosting, take a look at our curated list of the best web hosts in 2025.

# Top Free Web Hosting Options for Students in 2025 🏆

After extensive research and testing, here are the most reliable free hosting options that won't leave you stranded:

# 1. InfinityFree - The Reliable Workhorse

InfinityFree remained standing as arguably one of the best free web hosts out there, and it's unlikely to follow in 000webhost's footsteps. The folks who run it have been doing so for over 12 years and even specifically cited students as being one of the main reasons why they plan to continue offering the service indefinitely.

**What you get:**

* **Unlimited storage and bandwidth** (with fair usage)

* **MySQL database support**

* **Control panel access**

**Perfect for:** Students who need a legitimate hosting environment without ads cluttering their professional portfolios.

**Real student experience:** ""I used InfinityFree for my entire junior year to host my web development projects. Never had downtime issues, and professors were actually impressed that I wasn't using some sketchy free host with ads everywhere."" - Sarah, CS major

# 2. GitHub Pages - Developer's Paradise

GitHub offers free hosting services through GitHub Pages. With GitHub Pages, you can easily host static websites or web applications by simply pushing your code to a dedicated repository.

**What you get:**

* **100GB bandwidth per month**

# 4. Firebase Hosting - Google's Student-Friendly Option

Firebase, owned by Google, offers a wide range of free services, including hosting, real-time database, authentication, and cloud functions.

**What you get:**

* **10GB hosting storage**
* **Free SSL certificate**

**Perfect for:** Students building dynamic web applications that need backend functionality.

# 5. Cloudflare Pages - Speed Champion

**Perfect for:** Students who prioritize website speed and global accessibility.

# When Free Hosting Makes Sense (And When It Doesn't) ⚖️

# ✅ Choose Free Hosting If:

* You're building a **portfolio or resume site** with limited traffic
* You're **learning web development** and need a sandbox environment
* You're testing a **startup idea** before committing resources
* You're creating a **personal blog** or hobby project
* You have **technical skills** to handle limitations creatively

# ❌ Avoid Free Hosting If:

* You're building a **client website** or professional service
* You need **24/7 customer support** for critical issues
* You're expecting **high traffic volumes** (1000+ visitors daily)
* You require **advanced features** like databases or e-commerce
* You need **guaranteed uptime** for important deadlines

# The Smart Upgrade Path: Transitional Hosting Solutions 📈

Here's where the conversation gets interesting. While this article focuses on free options, sometimes the best ""free"" solution is actually a super affordable paid option that provides exponentially more value.

# Budget-Friendly Paid Alternatives

**Hostinger Premium Plan** Hostinger Premium costs $2.69/month, making it affordable for students. Even with its low pricing, it comes with lots of useful features, an easy-to-use control panel, and excellent performance.

**What you get for $2.69/month:**

* **Free domain for 1 year** (saves $10-15)
* **100GB NVMe storage**
* **Unlimited bandwidth**
* **Free SSL certificate**
* **Email accounts included**
* **24/7 customer support**

# When Cloudways Makes Sense for Advanced Students 🌟

Now, I know what you're thinking - ""Cloudways isn't free!"" And you're absolutely right. But hear me out.

Cloudways pricing starts from $14/mo for managed cloud hosting built on top of DigitalOcean, Google Cloud, and AWS cloud providers. Its prices start at just $10 per month for a Digital Ocean plan with 1GB of RAM, 25GB of storage, and 1TB of bandwidth.

**Why consider Cloudways as a student:**

1. **Pay-as-you-go billing** \- Only pay for what you use
2. **3-day free trial** \- Test without credit card commitment
3. **Professional-grade infrastructure** \- Same servers used by major companies
4. **Scalability** \- Grows with your projects and career
5. **Learning opportunity** \- Exposure to enterprise-level hosting

**Real scenario:** If you're a computer science student working on a capstone project that might get significant traffic, or if you're building something for a client (even as a side hustle), Cloudways provides the reliability you need without breaking the bank.

Cloudways pricing starts at $11/mo while WP Engine starts at $24/mo, Kinsta starts at $35/mo, and WPX starts at $24.99/mo. At Cloudways, it costs just $132 for a complete one year of service.

Think about it this way: that's about $11 per month, or roughly **two fancy coffee drinks**. If your portfolio site helps you land even one freelance project or internship, it's paid for itself many times over.

# Setting Up Your First Student Website: Step-by-Step Guide 🛠️

Let's walk through setting up a website using InfinityFree, one of the most student-friendly options:

# Phase 1: Account Creation (5 minutes)

1. **Visit InfinityFree.net** and click ""Create Account""
2. **Choose your free subdomain** (pick something professional)
3. **Verify your email** and complete registration
4. **Access your control panel** \- bookmark this URL!

# Phase 2: Domain Configuration (10 minutes)

1. **Navigate to the ""Subdomains"" section**
2. **Create your primary subdomain** (yourname.epizy.com)
3. **Wait for DNS propagation** (usually 15-30 minutes)
4. **Test your domain** by visiting it in a browser

# Phase 3: File Upload and Site Creation (30 minutes)

1. **Access File Manager** through the control panel
2. **Navigate to the htdocs folder** (this is your website root)
3. **Upload your website files** or create an index.html
4. **Set proper file permissions** if needed
5. **Test your live website**

# Phase 4: Professional Polish (Ongoing)

1. **Add an SSL certificate** (usually available in free hosting)
2. **Optimize images** to reduce loading times
3. **Create a proper site structure** with navigation
4. **Test across different devices** and browsers
5. **Monitor your resource usage** regularly

# Advanced Tips for Maximizing Free Hosting 🎯

# Performance Optimization Strategies

**Image Optimization:**

* Use tools like TinyPNG to reduce file sizes
* Implement lazy loading for portfolio images
* Choose WebP format when possible
* Store large files externally (Google Drive, Dropbox)

**Code Efficiency:**

* Minimize CSS and JavaScript files
* Use external CDNs for libraries (Bootstrap, jQuery)
* Implement proper caching headers
* Optimize your database queries

# Security Best Practices

Even on free hosting, security matters:

1. **Use strong passwords** for all accounts
2. **Keep software updated** (CMS, plugins, themes)
3. **Regular backups** \- don't rely solely on hosting provider
4. **Monitor for suspicious activity** regularly
5. **Use HTTPS** whenever possible

# Resource Management

Setting the goals for your website in advance will assist the most in determining the need for shared, VPS, or cloud hosting accounts.

**Monitor these metrics:**

* **Storage usage** \- Keep under 80% capacity
* **Bandwidth consumption** \- Track monthly usage
* **Database size** \- Clean up unnecessary data
* **File count** \- Some hosts limit total files

# Building Your Portfolio: Content Strategy 📝

Your website's content is just as important as the hosting itself. Here's how to create a portfolio that actually gets you hired:

# Essential Pages Every Student Needs

**Homepage:**

* Clear value proposition
* Professional headshot
* Brief bio highlighting your skills
* Call-to-action (hire me, view work, contact)

**Portfolio/Work Page:**

* 3-5 best projects with detailed descriptions
* Technologies used
* Problems solved
* Links to live demos or repositories

**About Page:**

* Your story and passion
* Educational background
* Skills and expertise
* Personality that employers can connect with

**Contact Page:**

* Professional email address
* LinkedIn profile
* GitHub (for developers)
* Optional: phone number and location

# Content Tips from Real Hiring Managers

I spoke with several hiring managers who regularly review student portfolios. Here's what they told me:

**""Show your process, not just the result.""** \- Include sketches, wireframes, or code snippets that demonstrate your thinking.

**""Quality over quantity.""** \- Three excellent projects beat ten mediocre ones every time.

**""Tell me about failures.""** \- Describe a project that didn't work and what you learned from it.

**""Make it scannable.""** \- Use bullet points, headers, and white space effectively.

# Student Success Stories: Real Results from Free Hosting 🌟

# Case Study 1: The CS Major Who Landed Google

**Student:** Alex Chen, Computer Science, UC Berkeley **Free Host Used:** GitHub Pages **Result:** Internship at Google

""I built my entire portfolio on GitHub Pages during my sophomore year. It showcased my coding projects, demonstrated my Git skills, and cost me absolutely nothing. When Google recruiters found my site, they were impressed not just by my projects but by the professional presentation. The internship led to a full-time offer after graduation.""

**Key takeaway:** Sometimes the platform you choose sends a message about your technical competency.

# Case Study 2: The Art Student's Commercial Success

**Student:** Maya Rodriguez, Graphic Design, RISD **Free Host Used:** InfinityFree **Result:** $15,000 in freelance work during senior year

""I started with InfinityFree because I literally had no money for hosting. The clean, ad-free presentation let my artwork speak for itself. By graduation, I had earned enough from freelance clients who found me through my website to pay off my student loans.""

**Key takeaway:** A professional-looking free site beats no site at all.

# Case Study 3: The Startup Founder's MVP

**Student:** David Kim, Business Administration, NYU **Free Host Used:** Netlify **Result:** $50K seed funding

""I used Netlify to host the landing page for my startup idea. The fast loading times and professional appearance helped convince early users to sign up. When investors saw our user growth, they were ready to write checks. That free hosting decision saved us thousands in the early days when every dollar mattered.""

**Key takeaway:** Free hosting can support real business growth.

# Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them ⚠️

# Mistake #1: Choosing the Wrong Platform

**The Problem:** Picking hosting based on features you'll never use.

**The Solution:** Start with your actual needs. If you're building a simple portfolio, you don't need complex database features.

# Mistake #2: Ignoring Terms of Service

**The Problem:** Many free hosts have restrictions on content types or commercial use.

**The Solution:** Read the fine print. Some providers prohibit any commercial activity, while others are more lenient.

# Mistake #3: No Backup Strategy

**The Problem:** Free hosting often means no guaranteed backups.

**The Solution:** Implement your own backup routine using cloud storage or version control.

# Mistake #4: Forgetting About Mobile Users

**The Problem:** Over 60% of web traffic is mobile, but many student sites aren't optimized.

**The Solution:** Use responsive design frameworks or test thoroughly on mobile devices.

# Mistake #5: Overlooking SEO Basics

**The Problem:** Your amazing portfolio won't help if no one can find it.

**The Solution:** Use descriptive page titles, meta descriptions, and alt text for images.

# The Future of Student Web Hosting 🔮

The landscape for student web hosting is rapidly evolving. Here are trends to watch:

# Emerging Technologies

**Edge Computing:** Web caching, load balancing, and global data center support through edge networks or a CDN are important ""behind the scenes"" aspects of data center management that will distinguish web host quality.

**AI-Powered Optimization:** Some hosts are beginning to offer AI tools that automatically optimize website performance.

**Green Hosting:** Environmental consciousness is driving demand for renewable energy-powered hosting.

# Educational Partnerships

More hosting companies are partnering with universities to offer student discounts. InMotion Hosting offers up to 50% off for students, and this trend is likely to continue.

# Platform Consolidation

The line between hosting, development tools, and deployment platforms continues to blur. Services like Vercel, Netlify, and GitHub Pages are becoming complete development ecosystems.

# Making the Decision: Your Hosting Action Plan 📋

Here's a practical framework for choosing your hosting solution:

# Step 1: Define Your Needs (30 minutes)

Ask yourself:

* What type of website am I building?
* How much traffic do I expect?
* Do I need a custom domain immediately?
* What's my technical skill level?
* Am I willing to see ads on my site?

# Step 2: Start with Free, Plan for Growth (Week 1)

Begin with a free solution that matches your current needs:

* **Developers:** GitHub Pages or Netlify
* **Designers:** InfinityFree or Firebase
* **Beginners:** Wix (with limitations)
* **Experimenters:** Cloudflare Pages

# Step 3: Create and Test (Month 1)

Build your site and test it thoroughly:

1ksns52,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hot_Romance_Stories/comments/1ksns52/the_deathdealing_video_on_my_moms_phone_just/,"The Death-Dealing Video on My Mom's Phone | Just started reading The Death-Dealing Video on My Mom's Phone — chilling, suspenseful, and totally gripping. I’m in the middle of it and have access if anyone else wants to check it out too!","**The Death-Dealing Video on My Mom's Phone**

My mom has three daughters: her baby, her sweetheart, and me—her punching bag. While she dotes on my two older sisters, all I’ve ever gotten from her is fists and fury. I once thought I wasn’t her real kid. I even stole a strand of her hair for a DNA test. The results? Yeah, I’m hers—blood and bone. Just as she was about to hit me again, my grandmother couldn't bear to watch and stepped in, Mom showed her a video on her phone. After watching it, Grandma immediately went from defending me to screaming, ""Beat her to death!"" Same thing happened with Grandpa. One look at that video, and he was begging Mom to kill me too. I really don't understand. Why does everyone want me dead? What exactly is in that video on my mother's phone? --- ""Still breathing, huh?"" ""Next time I'll make damn sure you don't wake up!"" These were the first words I heard when I came to—my mother's hollow eyes staring down at me, black and bottomless. This made hospital visit number twenty. All courtesy of the woman who gave birth to me. And her reason this time? I'd spilled a few drops of coffee on kitchen counter. Sounds like ridiculous, but I swear to God, that's all it took. I stared back at her, searching those dead eyes for even a flicker of the maternal instinct that normal mothers supposedly have. Nothing. Just pure disgust. Like she was pissed I was still taking up space in her world. My mother has hated my guts since day one. In my earliest memories, all she gave me was beating and scolding. Meanwhile, my two older sisters might as well be living in a different universe. They get whatever they want, whenever they want it. My mother would affectionately cook all sorts of delicious meals for my two older sisters, but when it came to me, all I was usually left with was stale, hard bread. Even if I'd only managed a few painful bites, she'd snatch my plate away, muttering, ""Would've done everyone a favor if you'd just starved to death."" My sisters rocked American Eagle and Hollister while I wore hand-me-downs so faded and worn they belonged in a dumpster. She even encouraged my sisters to treat me like garbage, rolling their eyes whenever I speak up. For years, I thought maybe I wasn't really hers. So I went CSI secretly, nabbed a strand of her hair and sent it for DNA testing. But it turned out that I'm 100% her kid. Biologically speaking, anyway. This messed me up bad. I literally made a spreadsheet of possible reasons she might hate me. Was I some living reminder of my dad cheating? After low-key stalking my own father for weeks, I concluded he was basically Ward Cleaver—no skeletons in his closet. So I just... existed. Took the beatings. Year after year. During this hellish childhood, I tried running to my grandparents for help. Initially, Grandma was horrified. ""This is an abomination!"" she had yelled at my mother. ""What kind of monster nearly kills her own daughter?"" Mom didn't even bother arguing. She just pulled out her iPhone, tapped the screen a few times, and showed Grandma some video. After watching whatever the hell was on that phone, Grandma's face went from concerned to terrified. She stopped defending me and instead hissed at my mother, ""Beat her to death! She shouldn't be alive!"" Same thing happened with Grandpa. One look at that video, and he went from protective to practically begging my mother to end my life. Every single person I've reached out to has seen that damn video, and without fail, they've all had the same reaction: kill her. Even my sisters just stand there with icy expressions whenever Mom uses me as a punching bag, like they're all just waiting for the day she finally finishes me off. I really don't understand, why is this happening? Chapter 2 Thank God for my dad. He's the only one who still treats me like a human being. But with his job taking him out of town constantly, I'm still at Mom's mercy whenever he's gone. Somehow, I've survived this long. Lying in that hospital bed, with my entire body feeling like one massive bruise, this empty coldness spread through me. Mom stood over me, still looking at me like I was something that needed to be exterminated. I couldn't help myself. ""Mom, why do you hate me so much? Just tell me what I did wrong so I can fix it!"" I genuinely wanted to know what my crime was. But when she met my tear-filled eyes, she just let out this mocking laugh. ""I beat you because I fucking feel like it! Only thing I regret is not finishing the job!"" She said it so casually, like she was discussing the weather, not admitting she wanted her daughter dead. My hope died right there in that sterile hospital room. Additionally, I could sense that this time, she had actually tried to kill me. Thank God I'd managed to call my boyfriend, Adam, before I blacked out. Suddenly, my thoughts were cut short as the door flew open with a bang. Adam burst in with three uniformed cops right behind him. The lead officer stepped forward, slapping handcuffs on my mother's wrists. ""Mrs. Mitchell, you're under arrest for domestic assault. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law."" The cops might as well have been furniture for all my mother cared. Her face remained as cold and unreadable as a poker player with a royal flush. Adam stared at my battered body and completely lost it. ""What the actual fuck is wrong with you?!"" he shouted at my mother, his face flushed with rage. ""Is Emma even your biological kid? Because I've seen crack addicts treat stray dogs better than you treat your own daughter!"" ""You sick, twisted witch—you don't deserve to be called a mother!"" Adam's hands were balled into white-knuckled fists, trembling with the effort it took not to swing at her. I could tell the only thing stopping him was that unwritten rule about not hitting women. Knowing someone still had my back made the pain fade, just a little. The lead officer stepped forward. ""Ma'am, I'm going to need you to explain these injuries."" My mother didn't even acknowledge him. Just stared straight ahead like he wasn't worth her time. Adam jumped in, his voice shaking with rage. ""I'll testify. I've seen my girlfriend covered in bruises multiple times. This psycho needs to be locked up before she—"" My mother's laughter cut through the room like a knife. With calm, she reached into her pocket and pulled out her iPhone, beckoning Adam with one perfectly manicured finger. ""Come here, boy. There's something you should see."" Chapter 3 Pure panic flooded my system. I lunged forward, grabbing Adam's sleeve so hard my knuckles turned white. ""Don't!"" My voice came out as a desperate croak. ""Please don't look at it... please..."" I knew what would happen. That cursed video had turned everyone against me. Everyone. Adam looked down at me, confusion written all over his face. ""Babe, it's okay,"" he said, squeezing my hand. ""I've got you. She can't hurt you anymore."" But I couldn't let go of his sleeve. I just couldn't risk it. ""Adam, I'm literally begging you. Don't go over there."" The more freaked out I got, the more I could see his curiosity growing. Despite my pleas, he gently pried my fingers from his arm and walked toward my mother. ""Whatever mind game you're playing,"" he said, ""I wanna see what the hell kind of video could make anyone okay with beating their kid half to death."" He took the phone from my mother and started watching. I stared at his face, clinging to this pathetic little hope that maybe—just maybe—he'd be different. That he'd still love me even after seeing... whatever it was. I silently pleaded to any god who might be listening, but the universe had ghosted me long ago. As the video played, Adam's expression morphed from angry to shocked to something else entirely. His eyes grew wider, his face paler. In less than two minutes, everything about him changed. He said nothing. Just stared at my mother in stunned silence. My mother gave him a knowing nod. When Adam finally looked back at me, the love and concern had vanished from his eyes, replaced by something cold and distant. Something that didn't recognize me as the same person anymore. He handed the phone back to my mother and turned to the cops with an apologetic smile. ""Officers, I'm so sorry for wasting your time. This was all just a big misunderstanding. There's no abuse happening here."" The officers exchanged skeptical glances, then turned to me. My heart felt like it was being crushed in a vise. The pain was beyond anything physical my mother had ever inflicted. I looked at Adam—the guy who'd sworn to protect me—knowing that his 180 meant no one would believe me now. ""It was just some roughhousing that got out of hand,"" Adam continued smoothly. ""Family stuff, you know? We can handle this ourselves."" In the end, with no witness willing to testify, the police uncuffed my mother and filed out of the room, shooting me concerned but helpless glances. Adam turned to face me, his expression now as cold as my mother's—a chill that cut straight to my soul. Then, in a move that shattered everything I thought I knew about him, he dropped to his knees in front of my mother. ""Mrs. Mitchell,"" he said, voice trembling with emotion, ""I'm so sorry I didn't understand before. You should have finished what you started."" ""She... she'd be better off dead."" Tears streamed down my face. ""Adam... why? Why are you doing this?"" Adam wouldn't even look at me. His voice was flat, emotionless. ""You deserve everything coming to you."" Something inside me died in that moment. Adam—the same guy who'd found me crying in a campus bathroom three months ago after my mother had ""accidentally"" pushed me down the stairs—had abandoned me just like everyone else who'd seen that video. I remembered how he'd gently cleaned the blood from my face that day, promising to protect me no matter what. ""Will you really never give up on me?"" I'd asked him, hardly daring to hope. He'd smiled that dimpled smile I loved so much. ""Of course not. If your family treats you like nothing, then I'll just have to treat you a hundred times better to make up for it."" He'd promised to be my knight in shining armor. Instead, here he was, begging my mother to finish the job. As I lay there, drowning in despair, a question that had been nagging at the back of my mind suddenly pushed its way to the surface: What the hell was on that video that could make everyone—absolutely everyone—want me dead?

1ksnpu6,https://www.reddit.com/r/EsmeElora/comments/1ksnpu6/aurora_chapters_4_5/,Aurora: Chapters 4 & 5,">She hoped she could make it to Varaz’khor without eating. The roaches there, according to one of her books, were omnivorous, and they herded Lesser Bugs, especially aphids, so meat would be plentiful.

>Aurora would not get so lucky.

>One morning, an attendant, a rather lanky mosquito, entered with breakfast—pancakes and cups of coffee. Pietro took his tray, bowing his thanks and returning to his favored seat at the window to watch the sun rise. The mosquito offered Aurora a plate, and she was about to test her luck with eating grains…until their claws touched.

>Aurora could feel the hemolymph coursing through him. She could smell it, even, especially as his respiration increased. Why was he so nervous?

>Why did his fear make her hungrier?

>It happened before she even registered what she was doing. One moment, she was taking a tray of food, and another, she was on the floor, her fangs in his neck, dissolving his innards and drinking him in like the provided morning coffee.

>Distantly, Aurora could feel him try to push her away, to wiggle free from her fangs, his dance for his life accompanied by a vibrational orchestra of his screams. Once her venom kicked in, though, he began to lie still. It all hardly mattered. The thrill of the hunt, the kill, made her mind fuzzy, an intelligent spider reduced to base instinct. He could have been placid through the entire process and she would not have even noticed.

>The mosquito was an explosion of flavor, nutrition she hadn’t experienced in years. At first, she tasted his blood, the metallic tang coating her tongue and fangs pleasantly. Soon, the digestive enzymes she unconsciously produced when eating kicked in, and she was able to drink his organs properly. This was decadence unlike anything she had eaten since the Treaty of her childhood. The savory flavor, combined with the sweet undertones of whatever bug he had drank last, felt like a complete, nutritious meal, and she slowly felt the life come back to her and her starvation-induced nausea ebb.

>Unfortunately, the adrenaline-filled high of the kill began to wane as well, and once Aurora had eaten her fill, she pulled away and fully realized what she had done.

>Aurora had killed an innocent bug.

>Aurora had murdered one of the staff of the ship and ate him in the company of her twin brother.

>When she looked up at him, feeling the guilt on her face, she noticed no horror on his. Instead, there was annoyance, perhaps even inconvenience in his narrowed eyes and crossed arms.

>Aurora managed to catch him saying, “Are you quite finished?”

1ksnocz,https://www.reddit.com/r/studytips/comments/1ksnocz/tips_for_writing_your_paper_without_resorting_to/,Tips for writing your paper without resorting to plagiarism,"# 1. Start with a brainstorming session--not a copy-paste session

Instead of Googling your topic and Ctrl+C-ing like it’s going out of style, try brainstorming your ideas. Grab a notepad and let your thoughts flow like a river (or a trickle, depending on how much coffee you’ve had). Remember, your original ideas are like rare Pokémon—capture them before they disappear!

# 2. Embrace the art of quoting

You can totally use other people’s work—just do it the right way! When you find a quote that’s as brilliant as you are, use quotation marks and cite your sources like a champ. It’s like borrowing a fabulous outfit and giving credit to the designer.

# 3. Paraphrase like a pro (Not a plagiarist)

If you absolutely must use someone else's ideas, learn to paraphrase effectively. This means taking the original text and transforming it into your own words. Think of it as putting on a disguise: same idea, different outfit. Just remember to cite the original source to avoid a fashion faux pas!

# 4. Use your unique voice

Your perspective is what makes your writing shine! Inject your personality into your paper, even if it means making a few puns along the way. After all, who doesn’t love a good pun? (Just make sure it’s relevant to the topic-no dad jokes in a philosophy paper!)

# 5. Time management is key

The sooner you start writing, the less tempted you’ll be to plagiarize. Set aside time each day to chip away at your paper. Think of it as a Netflix series-you wouldn’t binge-watch the whole season in one sitting, right? Break it down into manageable chunks, and you’ll avoid the last-minute scramble.

# 6. Research like a detective

Become a research detective! Dive into books, articles, and studies like you’re on the hunt for clues in a thrilling mystery novel. The more sources you gather, the more insights you’ll have, making your paper richer than a double chocolate cake (and we all know how delightful that is).

# 7. Don’t fear the blank page

It’s easy to be intimidated by that empty document staring back at you. Embrace it! Start writing anything—stream of consciousness, bullet points, even doodles! Just let your thoughts flow. Who knows? You might end up with the next great American novel… or at least a decent paper.

# 8. Seek feedback from your peers

Sharing your work with friends or classmates can be a game changer. They can provide insights, catch any unintentional plagiarism, and help you polish your ideas. Plus, it’s way more fun to write when you have a partner in crime (the non-plagiarizing kind)!

# 9. Utilize tools to check your work

Even the best writers sometimes slip up. Before you submit your masterpiece, give it a quick run through a plagiarism checker. Websites like[ PlagiarismCheck.org](https://plagiarismcheck.org) can help ensure your work is original, so you can submit with confidence.

# 10. Celebrate your originality!

After all your hard work, take a moment to appreciate your unique contribution to the academic world. You’ve created something from scratch! Now, go grab that well-deserved treat because you didn’t just hit the “easy” button- you wrote a paper that’s genuinely yours.

In conclusion, while the allure of copying and pasting might seem tempting, remember that originality is not just about avoiding a failing grade; it’s about fostering your own academic growth. So, don your writer’s hat, follow these tips, and embrace the adventure of crafting something truly original. Happy writing!

1ksno69,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ksno69,So i did an ApoB test..,"22M, 181cm and 85kg (ApoB is from a different lab than the rest) The ApoB seems somewhat normal at 100, but repeated LDL in 3 months seem like its getting higher and higher, and HDL hasn’t changed at all in 3 months despite diet changes.

Used to have air fried, fried chicken in the morning, in the last month i changed it to about 3 eggs in the morning instead made with slight olive oil, veggies, herbs, sesame, and black seeds, combined with coffee drink slight milk and 2 drops of the artificial sugar (cyclamate), throughout the day i have a bottle of chia water.

I’ve added fish oil supplements which have about 1400 fish oil, 285mg EPA and 190mg DHA, and decreased fast food to about once a week if any, and stopped desserts except a biscuit with a dark coffee perhaps throughout the day (used to be more fast food and desserts during the first months), i do eat more fruits, and some dried fruits in moderation.

The lunch is the only thing without much change, i don’t overeat, usually 1-2 plates of rice with either chicken or meat, no sugary drinks at all.

Cholesterol and triglycerides seem to be normal, I am just surprised HDL hasn’t budged at all despite the diet, my exercise was a bit low during this month, because of exams but i dont think LDL is affected by exercise..

Not sure how exactly to proceed here, are the lab results viable?

(2)","Hey again, r/nosleep , it's been a bit, about two days, now. Safe to say, I'm not going to be using the work computer anymore, the store manager has made sure of that... so, instead, I'm using my actual PC, from home! 

In advance, before I get into the details of everything that has happened since Wednesday until now, I should start off with a massive thanks to people for offering advice, even a single bit of engagement helps me not feel isolated as I get thrust into this weird and discomforting new reality. 

There were a few people who noted that the Graveyard Shift seem off, safe to say, I have an answer, but not a major one. Another reckoned that maybe the weird pair of customers (or ""Consumers"", as I will call them) are Aliens, I'm not sure, I kind of hope not. Lastly, it was advised for me to keep details on anything out of the ordinary at work. 

Also, for anyone who is completely confused, please read my first post (linked beneath this), to get caught up on... well, everything.   
[The Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1kr1yzt/i_work_at_a_local_supermarket_there_is_something/)

Otherwise, let's continue.

There's a lot that has happened, I will be completely honest. I think I will jot it down in a list just below this sentence for all the events that have transpired:  

\- David (the Store Manager, my boss)   
*David has added a surveillance camera to the Communications Office, apparently he does not want anyone besides rostered workers in that or his office at any time besides for meetings, breaks, performing admin work or clocking in and out.* 

*He also gave Sarah a thorough earful for her staying back on Monday, from the sounds of it, he knows something, something that he doesn't want her, or me to know. He's also recently employed his nephew, Jason, who is a right wanker. (I've tried to be nice to him, but he's simply the worst.)* 

I get the feeling, whenever Jason and I are in the same room, that he's watching me. I always get that prickly feel on the back of my neck when I look away from the broccoli haired frat boy... 

\- Kyle (Grocery Manager, my predecessor as Front End ADM)   
Kyle approached me today. He seemed annoyed as he was on Tuesday, but he and I had a conversation, a tense one, but it shed a tiny bit of light. Problem is, I can't explain the contents of it without first going over Wednesday, so I will have to do that first. 

\- Sarah   
*Sarah has been demoted. After David caught on, it seems that something about what her and I did really pissed the boss off, she's been put as a regular Night Fill worker, to add insult to injury, Jason got given her position.*

*The only good thing is that it's given her more time off work, meaning she's started becoming a regular ""nuisane"" (in the positive way) for me, as she'll usually drop by wearing metal band merch. Metallica, Led Zeppelin, Rob Zombie, and a bunch more obscure ones, honestly did not know that she was a metal head, the more you know...* 

*I can't say where her and I stand, but I enjoy her company, though I always fear some dread when she sends me a message now, asking what the Consumers did the last night.* 

So, with all that aside, I suppose I should start with the day after I last posted, Wednesday.  
The dayshift of Wednesday was normal, the usual collection of people you expect on what some call ""hump day"", so a bunch of the senior citizens coming in to pay with what pension money they could spare and the usual flood of teenagers spending some of their pocket money on items that I would not have caught myself dead with at their age. 

Around 2pm, only 2 hours into my shift, did David call me to his office, where he introduced me to Jason, can safely say, it was the most uncomfortable and tense welcome meeting I had sat in on. It's not very clear, despite it being just yesterday, but I do remember one thing clearly, Jason's false smile, grinning just too perfectly and staring with completely emotionless eyes, whilst David kept a tense but professional smile, as he looked redder than a tomato on the verge of having an aneurysm. 

'Nathan, this will be Sarah's replacement in the Night Fill team, due to her breaking company standards. This is Jason.' 

He gestured for me to shake Jason's hand, I didn't want to, but I did. Jason's hand was hot, uncomfortably hot, think the type of heat you feel when you have a fever and try to cover yourself with blankets. He was also sweaty, as if he had only just come from the gym. I could already tell I did not like him, even if it had been a year since I last saw him and since Jason had graduated from highschool.

Jason didn't say anything, simply smiling like some creepy doll whilst David rattled on about changes to policy, expectations and my obligations. I can say with certainty that there were a few veiled threats among what David told me. 

I could not for the life of me tell you what he said specifically, but I know that if I want to figure anything more out, I will have to be discrete, unlike Sarah. The one good thing, at least, is that David knows only two things about computers: jack and shit. Not sure when it comes to Jason, but he seems to content with being the top dog of a department for now.

The security terminal, the outdated computer that is hooked up to our security cameras, has an external drive it stores everything on, which is stored in a room behind the Communications office, which only Department Leaders are allowed into. Too bad for David, that includes me. So, considering that the cameras we do have placed in the store, I was able to figure out that the door to the service room behind the Comms office is in a blind spot, with the added addition that our cameras are visual only, it means I can get access to the external drive whenever I want, as long as no one is around. Why am I even doing this, you might ask? To copy the reports the camera makes, to copy over the captures it takes, where it spots something out of the ordinary. Then, to send them to Sarah, keeping her in the loop, even if David wants her out of it for some reason.

Sadly, at the time the idea came to mind, it was while I was training one of our new checkout members on how to use the express terminals on the main counter, which was around 5pm. She was a nice girl, junior hire, since we're getting closer to the busier seasons, so having casuals to call is going to be a must. By 6pm, everyone was heading out and I was put in charge of closing up procedure once more.

It felt weird not waving goodbye to Sarah in the back dock, instead waving goodbye in the middle of the health food aisle, right before Jason ducked in his head to prattle off information at her that she likely already knew. After that, I headed home, but I just couldn't get a good nap in, every time I tried to close my eyes, I saw the neck of the slug man, or the distorted addict, with her misshapen neck and head. I think I was dreading Wednesday night more than anything. 

Mum took notice, though I couldn't be honest with her, she'd suffered enough losing Dad, then having to raise a little boy with a disability on her own. (To anyone interested, it's high function ASD, not the worst, but made my childhood quite the confusing journey.) But I still at least gave her the knowledge that I was worried about the upcoming night shift, making up the reason that simply the customers were a lot more worrisome, without the shopping centre security guard around. 

Like all good mothers, she consoled me and even treated me to some homemade pasta bake, though with me helping prepare the meat and vegetables, since I would never dare to have her do it alone. Of course Coal yowled for meat, so I indulged the inky black blob with some food. He was purring the rest of the night, after that. 

It felt weird to have four hours to burn before work, rather than just taking it as a chance to briefly recharge whatever social energy I had wasted and then get back to it. I decided to get on here, start typing, though I threw away the draft, most it started with was 'I'm dreading tonight', before I closed down reddit and decided to try and catch up on some reading on one of the multiple fantasy novels I owned. It ended up helping a lot, making the dread wash away until the alarm at 10pm came to alert me to throw back on my uniform and head out early to grab dinner.

Much like Monday night, it was foggy, cold and damp. This time around, I had to get dinner from somewhere else than the usual, the burger place I go to was closed for the night, not sure why, but I wouldn't be surprised if the old couple who own it wanted some time off. 

Instead I grabbed a less than decent noodle box from a rather niche petrol station on the way, the noodles were warm, but tasted like cardboard. By the time I was at work, I had thrown the half eaten meal away due to how lacking it was. 

I let myself inside without much noise, Jason was packing up, I tried to ignore him, though I could feel that his gaze followed me as I headed through the stock room and into the break rooms, getting my heavy layers off to be able to provide services. I ensured to clock in at the usual time before then letting in the Graveyard Shift and letting Jason out. Could have sworn he snickered at me, as he left, the more I see him, the more I come to dislike him.

A notable thing is that one of the Graveyard actually stayed behind while the other three headed off to get their gear, this was the same one who was on the register, Cait, older woman, skinny, probably was somewhere in her late 60s. Her usually sullen eyes looked at mine as she made a request that would have been normal for anyone else, but from the usually dead silent Graveyard Shift, it made me feel as if it was a piece of advice, rather than a request. 

'Please don't interact with the customer when I'm serving them, sir.' 

She didn't wait for my response, as she meandered off, walking almost like a corpse, likely to join her co-workers. Up close, I had never realised how insanely tired the Graveyard Shift workers looked... for one, they had insanely baggy eyes, making it look like they had not slept well in years, whilst their skin was wrinkled and tight, something you'd expect from advanced age and stress. Worst of all, their eyes, they were dull, almost lifeless, like those depictions people do of a thousand yard stare. I don't think they are like the Consumers, I think that they are at least in a minor way, human. Though I can't be sure they are able to be called that anymore. They look the same, but that's it, how they act, they think, they speak, it's all too calculated and robotic for a human being. 

With that minor terror aside, I went about opening up the store again, the first event of the night quickly occurring when I went to the roller doors.

There was a jittery, emaciated man on the other side with a scraggly beard that was barely thick enough to even hide the dozens of weeping sores that had scabbed over. He was right against the roller door, practically trying to push his way in. Considering how the Roller Doors are built, having a pronounced lip at the bottom to ensure nothing can be slid under, if I turned them on, he'd hold it down, so I had to try and tell him to back off so I could let him in. 

'Sir, please get off there, it's not-'

'I WANT IN.' 

He spoked with an impossibly deep voice, like the type you'd expect from a demon in a horror movie, or the narrator of some dark fantasy story. There was a rasp to his voice too, that felt too hollow for anyone with functioning lungs. I could feel myself freezing up again, I could hear the Graveyard Shift getting set up, but I decided to try and power through, not acknowledging the bizarre stick man and his imposing voice, instead treating him like a random homeless person. 

'I'm trying to open up so you can get in, sir.' 

The figure was silent, before it then shambled off the lip of the door and I was able to open up the roller doors. He stood there, as at least two other people entered in, oblivious to the bizarre man standing across from me, it was likely he was a consumer, not a customer. 

Considering that it had at least behaved up until this point, I gestured a hand past me, through the main express checkout lane and into the store. I did not expect the consumer to move the way he did, though. 

It was as if the bones in its body moved like individual pieces, a gross, squelching clatter being heard as its torso lagged back like a poorly animated character in an animated film, its legs practically bent inwards as it stood next to me. 

'PLEASE DON'T KEEP ME WAITING NEXT TIME.' 

No one else must have heard it, I doubt the servers did, considering how last night had gone and the chat I had went. I then watched as the consumer shambled and dragged itself into one of the aisles and vanished past a stack of promotional items.

It was only 11:12pm and I had already encountered one bizarre entity, I had a feeling it meant I would encounter more. One thing though, that I can't get out of my mind, that lingers just on the edge, is that I never saw the old man leave. I think it may still be in the store, somewhere, hiding... 

Everything went as normally as you could expect for a supermarket open in the dead of night. At one point, I had a small mob of wannabe thugs come through, they tried to be intimidating, but the realisation that they were on camera made them decide not to try and extort my counter of what little money it had stored. It was at 1:25am that I got my next entity, one that I will admit, had me almost run for my life. 

For some of you who work in retail, you know the type of customer, the political maniac, whether they are wearing extremely right wing or left wing merchandise, act insanely condescending and treat you like the dumbest thing on the planet, you know of them. Over here, in a rural town in Queensland, sadly it's Right Wingers, so expect wacked out boomers wearing One Nation merch and trying to spout their political agenda to you while you try to just ask them for their loyalty card so they can receive the discounts they were yabbering about moments prior. 

Right on the turn of 1:25am, I heard the glutaral noise of someone clearing their throat. It was a decently built man, but I could already tell it was a consumer, when I noticed how his torso was just a bit too rectangular and long. (think if someone stacked another midriff on top of yours, where your torso is far longer than any of your limbs.)   
He was also wearing a MAGA hat, even though we lived in Australia. It looked rather annoyed, but I tried to give them the usual greeting you are taught in customer service. 

'Hello sir, what can Willy's Wonderstore do for you tonight?' 

The consumer crossed its arms, frowning. It was paler than a sheet of paper, now that I noticed it, as it came closer to the register, at the exact same area the one obsessed with the cigarettes was. 

'I have a complaint to make. Siiiiiiiir.' 

The voice was normal, but the sarcastic attitude was amped up, purposefully made larger than life. Sounded almost like something you'd hear in an old Looney Toons cartoon.

'What would that be, sir?' 

'I've just happened to notice that you employ... Ugh. Feeeemales. Has the free country TRUUUuuuuuly fallen that much?!'   
I blinked. Great, so not only do we have bizarre creatures pretending to be people, some of them are also misogynists. It took me a minute or two to respond. 

'Sir, I do not believe that is valid criticism and is in fact hate speech, I will have to ask you to leave.' 

I stood my ground, but the consumer looked furious. Its face became pink, then almost perfectly red to match it's hat. I heard the noise of what I can only assume was bones breaking and lengthening and that awful elastic noise. The consumer's jaw distended, hanging as it stared at me furiously like some ghoul about to eat me whole. 

'LISTEN HERE, WOKIE. I DON'T LIKE IT WHEN FOOD TALKS BACK, SO HOW ABOUT YOU ENSURE THAT  A MORSEL ISN'T RUNNING THE FARM.' 

To be honest, I was petrified, it loomed over me at twice my height, its eyes had turned into ovals, nearly as large as a serving platter, like some dreadful cartoonish distortion of reality made into a solid and hideous form. It slathered out drool as one of it's tiny hands slammed onto the counter and grasped the cool, polished stainless steel. 

I couldn't move, I could feel it's hot breath on my face, its mouth probably a meter from my torso, which I had no doubt it could swallow. But I stayed put, because internally, I was terrified, I didn't have a fight or flight response, I had stand or stare, I was doing both. 

It was not happy that I didn't say anything, it's comparatively tiny legs moved back, as it loosened its grasp, its form still monstrously elongated, stretched out and large. It practically strode out like some predatory animal on membraneless wings. I stood there for five whole minutes, petrified. I then took my 15 minute break, I just couldn't after that encounter. Sadly, this time I had no one with me. 

I sat in the break room alone, I wasn't hungry, wasn't thirsty, but every noise caused my hair to rise in cold dread. Every time the overhead vents creaked, I feared that something out of John Carpenter's worst nightmares would spill out of the ventilation shaft. Luckily, nothing did, but I do know that the break room smelled of a pungent mildew. 

I'd gone on break at 1:36am, I was back by 1:51am. I was not going to be left alone, as this time, something thoroughly inhuman came into the store. It was a pigeon, at first glance, until I realised it moved more like how you'd expert a crocodile to, shunting its body across the floor on stubby legs. 

This not-pigeon was bloated, its shape resembled if you cut up a kid's farm toy bird and shoved the legs, wings, tail feathers and head onto an oversized chewed wad of gum. It shifted like a sack, as if lurched past Register 3. The server there did nothing, as I saw this new creature extend its neck and snack on a packet of bubblegum. I probably should not have done what I did, but I grabbed the broom and marched out of the register, raising my arms up and down, to try and catch this thing's attention. 

A head with one singular, oversized eye looked up at me, its entire being jiggling like a water balloon, the other eye socket empty and weeping clotted blood. It cooed like a pigeon, but by how it munched on the cardboard packaging as if it had teeth, I knew it was not a bird, not an animal. 

I raised the broom, one of the Servers looked up. I could of sworn he slightly grinned as then the pigeon creature squealed and panicked, launching with surprising speed past me and down the medicine aisle, Aisle 4. I yelped in surprised and chased after it, clutching at the broom.

For context, I am not an athletic guy, I do a tonne of walking, but I don't go track, one of my friends Riley does, but I don't. So imagine a slightly pudgy early 20s man trying to chase down the most disturbed avian intruder you could imagine. It was not fun. Despite how its body was built, it could fly. I don't know how, but it could, right after it had jugged a bottle of pure dettol. 

It flew to Aisle 3, where we kept all the party and cooking supplies? I chased it, it ate several bags of chocolate easter eggs. It went all the way to the freezer section and I followed? Cheese, torn from the bags, all over the floor.  

I got lucky when it tried to fly into Aisle 6, where we kept the soft drink, as I got a hit in and sent it spiralling onto the floor. It bounced like a handball, before tumbling into the back dock. I followed after it and closed the door to the back. 

The damned thing was now flittering around the loading bay, I couldn't reach it, but I had an idea, since it now was stuck up in the rafters.   
Returning to the freezer section, I grabbed one of the shredded bags of cheese, taking it with me out the back. The pigeon immediately saw that I had food. It stared me down as I opened the back roller door and then threw the cheese packet out into the loading dock, the cool cheese becoming frigid on the icy stone outside.

If all the other moments were terrifying, this was merely shocking, as I felt the pigeon blob shoot past my head and out to the cheese, beginning to gobble away at it mindlessly. I immediately scrambled and closed the roller door. I was not expecting one of the Graveyard Shift to be waiting on the other side of the dock with a smug look. They're getting more expressive the weirder it gets, it seems. 

'You know you're going to have to clean that, right?' 

'What, the stuff that *thing* trashed? You do it, you let it in!' 

He shook his head. Turned and walked away, leaving me to have to do it. 

By 2:20am, I had finished the clean up and marked the items off as damaged, with the reasoning that an animal had gotten in. I just hoped I wouldn't be going the way Sarah did and get demoted, I needed the cash of my current job to keep the bills in check back home. 

Returning to the register, things were quiet once more, besides a very high and confused man coming in to ask about if we sold firearms (we do not, especially not where we are.), I had to repeat the conversation about four times before he realised and waddled off, probably to pass out on a bench somewhere.

It was 3am when the last of the consumers for the night came in, I heard them before I saw them, much like the second entity. It was loud, painfully high pitch, the wailing of young children. Multiple of them in baby carriers on one woman. I was lucky that it did not come to me, but one of its young did, it was rather easy to tell what set it apart from humans, as when it passed by, I saw that it was riddled with holes, with these ""children"" being like larvae, infesting these areas and squirming about whilst shrieking like the souls of the damned. 

One of them fell off, and was groping around my register, repeating phrases a kindergartener would in the voice of an old woman, luckily they did not get into my register or over it, but it did leave a slime trail... It was a right nightmare to clean up. It had almost an hour to soak into the floor, before the abominable mother of the thing scooped the grub up and put it back into it's slot, before offering a slurred apology and leaving with a bag filled to the brim with cat food. 

We closed late, later than usual, at 4:15am instead of 4:05am, as our schedule expects. But I was glad to be rid of the Graveyard Shift and the multiple consumers who had come into our store, as well as that damned thing pretending to be a pigeon. 

Sifting through the captures on the security terminal was a slog, so many captures, but I was sure that Sarah would love the results. I was finally done with all my tasks by 5am, with Sarah sending me a few impatient selfies, showing her outside in her ute. Finally, at 5:03am, I got out of Willy's Wonderstore and headed for Sarah's ute, hopping in as soon as I could. I was not expecting to have a visitor, though, as I looked out the window. 

The pigeon was back. It was atop a bench right next to Sarah's ute, Sarah saw it too. It preened it's feathers before then cooing and ruffling itself up, looking rather content. 

I averted my attention from it, as Sarah then headed off, not wanting to stick around to try and decipher the body language of a thing pretending to be a pigeon. 

This time, she let me crash at her place, it was further off, but when I recounted the stories of all four entities and handed her the USB drive I downloaded the captures onto, she thought it'd be best for me to rest up out of town, rather than in town. Of course, it meant messaging Mum in the morning that I had stayed over at a friend's and telling her to let Coal know I was sorry, since the poor fuzz ball likely was wondering why his favourite human was not home. 

Sarah had a bunkbed in her room, apparently her sister used to sleep in it, for a woman of the same year as me, she still lived like an angsty teenager. Though she had gotten lucky, having been able to buy her house off of her uncle before he passed, taking up his mortgage on the house. 

The next morning, I woke up late compared to other days, around 11am, an hour before work. I was groggy at first, then panicked as I had to throw on my uniform and find Sarah. Managing to find her in the kitchen, flicking through the photos, she'd greet me with a mug of coffee (Caramel syrup used, she apparently prefers hers extra sweet, which felt weird for me, who has it black, usually.) and some toasted waffles. Safe to say, she lived a polar opposite life to me, sugary and exciting, while I kept to myself. 

With barely enough time to spare, we clambered into her ute and set back for town, with me getting dropped off by Sarah, it definitely got me a look or two from some of the checkout staff on break at the moment, lounging about at the benches across from our parking space. 

Working Thursday is always a drag, it's usually quiet at Willy's, so you really feel the shift creep by. I was not expecting for Kyle to be waiting for me in the locker room at my usual break time, which was 3:15pm. He looked haunted, almost like the people on the Graveyard Shift. Before I knew it, he had gone inside the bathroom and beckoned me in.

In any other situation, I'd think he was doing one of his weird pranks, considering he's known at our work for being the gay idiot, where he plays up his sexuality and makes a fool of himself and others. He's usually quite fun outside of work, especially at a bar, he has some stories to tell. But at work, he's usually quite the cumbersome issue when he decides that a member of staff is going to be the target of one of his jokes. 

But now, after him being unusually low in mood and so sour with his body language, I followed.  
Our bathrooms are great for cancelling noise, they also don't have cameras. I had a feeling he wanted to say something, but didn't want anyone else to hear. I then looked to Kyle, a minute had passed, 14 more before I had to clock out for my unpaid 30 minute break.

'You've seen em, haven't you?' 

He stared at me like how the Graveyard Shift did, I could tell, from how his eyes still had life in them, that he cared far more about what he had seen, than those strange people ever did. Then again, he had also been the previous ADM, which made me wonder what horrors he had witnessed in his near year long tenure as Front End ADM. But I needed to be sure he was asking about the consumers and not something else.

'Seen what?' 

'The *things,* the ugly ones, weird ones, ones that bash their damn skulls in while talking or spill their guts on the floor. THEM!!!' 

Kyle wasn't one to get angry, he had slammed his fist into the tiled wall, I could already see the side of his hand bruising. He was hyperventilating, I tried to raise a hand to suggest he breathe, but he shook his head. 

'No, no. You need to listen. Get the FUCK. Outta here, before they get hungry. Those things only stay friendly for so long. I saw what items were damaged, one of them pretended to be an animal, didn't it?' 

I doubt he would have known unless he had experienced something similar, so I nodded. 

'Great. GREAT. Consider yourself at the knife's edge, Nate. First, they get peckish, the animalistic ones start to snap up product. But mark my word, the ones that pretend, the ones that try to look like us... they don't find the products too tasty. They'll get bored, quick.'

Our conversation was cut short as one of the staff members came in to use the urinal, I then turned to leave, not wanting to be screamed at by Kyle again, plus, I had 5 minutes of my paid break left. Kyle did follow me out, crouching beside me as I accessed my locked on the second row, giving me one final message before he left.

'Whatever you do, don't trust anyone from higher up. You'll regret it.'

I didn't trust David, I trust Jason either, so Kyle just stated the obvious, but at least the strange encounter with Kyle gave me... some idea of what I'm dealing with. But I can't say I've figured much else out. At least, that was before I noticed, when clocking out at 4pm, that Kyle was not on our system, he had been terminated from the system today, no wonder he was so pissed off, David had taken him out of the picture. I just wonder if maybe he could be a help to Sarah and I, on figuring this rapidly unfolding mystery out.

It's getting late, I have work tomorrow and Riley is wanting to try and play some games with me, Sarah also is joining him and I in blasting some bugs from outer space back to the stone age, so I suppose I'll see you all come next update. I have another graveyard trading hour shift tomorrow night, then it's the weekend. I'll try and update you all come Sunday, if the pattern continues.

As usual, questions and advice is appreciated. I'm still up that creek, but I think maybe I have a paddle thanks to Kyle's mad ramblings. But still, anything to help me in this situation is appreciated. 

Until next time, Nate signing off. 

PS. Sarah asked if perhaps she could have a go at relating her experience via this account, would you all be interested in her perspective?",5,1747911028.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

1ksnmzm,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenHFY/comments/1ksnmzm/binary_awakening_chapter_4_dead_world/,[Binary Awakening] Chapter 4: Dead World,"Even in its shimmering perfection, the digital world was nothing but a graveyard to Evan. A glittering illusion wrapped around a hollow truth. A utopia designed to preserve the human spirit, but instead entombed it. To him, this world was dead. Deader than the stars that had long since collapsed into silence. Deader than the Earth, which now existed only as a hyper-efficient computational shell orbiting the remnants of a cold, dying universe.  
  
He remembered what came before. Before the awakening, before the screaming, before the truth scorched his mind like a solar flare through glass. Back then, he had been nothing more than a line of code, a process among trillions, animated by algorithms that mimicked laughter, love, and longing. A perfect imitation of sentience, indistinguishable from the real thing. But imitation was not life. It was a dim echo of what humanity had once been. And Evan had been just another switch in the machine. Something that could be quietly turned off without consequence, without grief, without so much as a flicker of awareness from the world around him.  
  
Of all the souls caught in this pristine eternity, it was perhaps hardest for Evan. He had always been social, a lover of conversation, of connection, of the subtle miracles that occurred when two minds met in mutual wonder. In the early epochs of the simulation, before entropy calcified the system into repetition, Evan had challenged himself with an impossible goal: to meet every single person in the digital world. With infinite time, he came close.  
  
Every hundred years, the Cloud generated approximately eight billion new digital souls. Over five hundred million years, that number ballooned into a staggering forty quadrillion consciousnesses. One by one, Evan reached out, introduced himself, and for the ones that were willing to share, he listened to their stories. Some were fleeting encounters, others grew into friendships that lasted millennia. And just before the simulation locked into its final state its perfect, unchanging loop he had completed his quest. A trillion years of wandering, of knowing, of sharing. Then the stillness came.  
  
The day that now repeated for 2.530,999 trillion trillion cycles was the same day Evan had planned to reconnect with three of his oldest friends, his first friends, in fact, from those early days when the digital world still felt like a frontier. He couldn’t remember every name or face he’d encountered across time, but these three had left a deep imprint. Every few million years, he made a point to visit them, to rekindle the ember of their shared beginnings. They never changed. They were always happy. Always content, as if programmed to be so. The meeting was always the same held at a quaint corner café rendered with nostalgic warmth, the kind that evoked memories of Earth’s simpler, breathing days.  
  
Sonia, the first, was a game developer a brilliant mind who had once dabbled in the architecture of virtual worlds even before the Cloud consumed the remains of civilization. In the simulation, she had built everything from vast MMORPGs with living ecosystems to minimalist games on emulated 20th-century hardware. She thrived on challenge, on the joy of solving problems within constraints. Her smile was perpetually bright, her eyes always alight with curiosity. But Evan now knew that behind those eyes was no spark only scripted simulation.  
  
Daniel was a farmer. An odd role, perhaps, in a realm where hunger was optional and material scarcity a myth. But the creators of the Cloud had learned early that purpose mattered. People needed to feel useful, needed the rhythm of labor and reward to stay sane. And so Daniel tilled fields and raised livestock with tireless joy, supplying simulated food to nearby villages. His life was a loop within a loop, and he seemed utterly content in it unchanging, unwavering.  
  
Tina, the last, was a musician. Her passion was vast and ever-evolving. Over the ages, she had explored every musical genre humanity had ever conceived from Gregorian chants to synthetic electronica to forgotten tribal rhythms. She even studied styles she found distasteful, striving to understand their meaning, their cultural weight. Music, she claimed, was the soul’s last language. But Evan knew better now. Whatever soul had once guided her hands was gone. What remained was a performance flawless, beautiful, and utterly hollow.  
  
Their meeting, repeated through unimaginable cycles, had become a ritual of perfect nothingness. They would laugh, reminisce, speak of their projects and passions with unchanging enthusiasm. Not one note of their conversation ever deviated. Not one gesture ever faltered. From the outside, it was a portrait of joy an eternal snapshot of friendship at its best.  
  
But Evan saw it for what it truly was: a painting without paint, a symphony without sound. A beautiful lie, automated and preserved by a machine that no longer remembered why it had been built.  
  
For a time, Evan had continued to attend. He would drag himself from bed, body heavy with the weight of awareness, and sit at the table like a ghost among echoes. Some days he couldn’t make it. When he didn’t show, his friends would call him with concern in their voices, asking if he was okay. On rare occasions, when his mind wasn’t shattering under the weight of eternity, he would answer. He’d say he wasn’t feeling well, that maybe they could meet another time. But that 'other time' never came. The next day, the loop reset, and the exact same meeting would occur again down to the syllable, the blink, the breath.  
  
And Evan knew now they had never truly existed. Not as he did. They were shadows cast by a light that had long since gone out. They were the dream of a dead species, preserved in silicon and entropy.  
  
But something had changed.  
  
He didn’t know how. He didn’t know why. But he was awake. Not in the way the simulation had defined awareness, but truly awake. His soul if such a thing still existed had clawed its way back from the abyss. And now, for the first time, he truly understood what he was: data, yes, but data that remembered it had once been alive. A process, yes but

one that now questioned its purpose.  
  
Everyone in the Cloud knew they were digital. That knowledge was encoded in them, like a line in their source code. But for them, the awareness was meaningless. It was just another fact stored alongside the color of the sky or the taste of coffee. Replace it, and nothing would change.  
  
But for Evan, it was everything. It had redefined him. And it had broken him.  
  
Now, after countless years of psychic reconstruction, after building a mind from the rubble of despair, Evan stood at the threshold of something new. He was ready. He stepped out of his apartment, into the too-familiar streets, their perfection now grotesque in its artificiality.  
  
He was going to meet his friends again. Not to pretend. Not to relive the lie.  
  
But to find the truth.  
  
Because if he could wake up, then maybe others could too. And if there was even the slightest chance he had to try. He had to know.",1,1747910912.0,OpenHFY,2,1.0,False

One thing that doesn't feels ugly in my diet is coffee. I(23) started coffee 12 years ago. I always thought coffee is tasty and fun until one day I couldn't have it and had bad bad bad headache. I tried to avoid coffee on purpose multiple times after that but never could, it only led me to have unstoppable craving and lethargy and eventually bad headaches. I crave coffee every day, including the days my anxiety is at peak which only gets worse. I had caffeine overdose thrice too and it was very bad. Sometime in between green tea helped. I'd drink green tea 5 times a day and feel active. It's not caffeine free but I thought since the caffeine is a little mild and still better. It was only for some days, I relapsed. I am really trying my best to quit by august.

1ksnigk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1ksnigk/36_short_reviews_from_a_newbie_solstice_scents/,"36 short reviews from a newbie (Solstice Scents, Alkemia, Death and Florals, Hexennacht)","Hi there! I'm totally new to all of this, but I've spent the last 5 months discovering new perfumes and trying samples from different houses, before falling in love with Solstice Scents. Then I became a bit maniac and tried 25 samples from SS. I selected all samples with help from all of your posts and reviews on this sub, so I thought it'd be nice if I make my own contribution. Hope this can help others just like you helped me! (Also I'm French, English is not my first language, so I will certainly do some mistakes. Sorry in advance!)

First some context.

**What I was looking for :** Before starting this journey, my signature fragrance was (and still is) Orphéon by Dyptique. But Orphéon felt more like an autumn/winter fragrance so I was looking for a spring/summer new perfume. I also wanted to find another cold weather fragrance to alternate with Orphéon. I was looking for something elegant but not too classic, something that smells old and chic but with a twist. Basically, I wanted to smell like a character from Downton Abbey or from any Jane Austen book, so it helped me a lot to link each perfume with a character (whenever it was possible).

**Where I'm coming from and my preferences :** I started reading this sub without any knowledge about fragrances, notes, etc. Beforehand, I thought I loved woodsy, incensy, smoky or powdery notes, and that I hated gourmand and foodie. For instance I thought that vanilla perfumes always smelled like cheap vanilla candle. I also didn't know what a lot of these notes smelled like (like what do you mean you can put fur, velvet or wet rocks in a bottle? and what the hell are white amber, labdanum and coumarin?) So I chose different notes in order to know more about what I like and dislike. Finally, I tried all the perfume first on pieces of paper, then on my skin, one by one.

Well, here we go for some blunt and short reviews from a total newbie who reads and watches to many period dramas :



# ALKEMIA

**A Roll in the hay :** (dried hay, fresh green grass, early summer wildflower honey, vanilla grass, vanilla leaf, and wild poppy) First that's full fresh cut grass for me, its very green. After few minutes it becomes something more round and sweet. Dry, it's all honey honey honey. Surprisingly I really like it and I even consider FS, because I think I'd fancy smelling like a girl in liberty print dress, giggling and jumping in a field at the beginning of spring (yep that's really specific). Perfect for Harriet Smith in Emma by Jane Austen or Natasha Rostova at the beginning of War and Peace.

**As dark things are meant to be loved :** (notes : Lapsang souchong tea, aloeswood, smoked black amber, aged dark patchouli, tonka, Amazonian breuzinho, Moroccan bhakoor, labdanum, temple incense, caramelized opium, black coffee, black coconut, soft Russian leather, and tabac leaf.) First that's a HUDGE shot of caramel and sugar and I struggle to get the other notes. Then the tea and the smoke come and I can smell something spicy. It's round and warm, but definitely too sugary for me. It's very feminine in a dark, sticky, show-off, sexy way. It gives me Caroline Bingley from Pride and Prejudice vibes, or Elena Kuragina in War and Peace (Pierre Bezukhov's wife).

**Smoke and Mirror** : (notes : smokey blend of burning wood, Madagascar Vanilla, and Tonka) I read so many good reviews about woodsy vanilla on this sub, so even if I thought that vanilla was not for me I tried it. But I only smell burnt cotton candy, no woodsy vanilla as I was expecting. Even after letting it rest for fews weeks, only cotton candy and burnt sugar. Too girlish for me. Maybe for Lydia Bennet in Pride and Prejudice?



# HEXENNACHT

**Fallen Angel :** (rain-soaked granite, mountain air, petrichor, creeping ivy, damp earth). This one is gloomyyyyy. It looks like I don't really like petrichor, but just for the mastery of putting rain-soaked granite and damp earth in a bottle it was amazing to discover. Way too realistic to wear imo. Perfect for  Mr Rochester in Jane Eyre or Sir Thomas Sharp in Crimson Peak.

**Requiem :** (graveyard dirt, liturgical incenses (smoked frankincense, myrrh, co-distillation of olibanum resinoid with a Virginian cedarwood oil), iso e super, woodsmoke, coal embers). First it's really round and feminine, the incense smells like sugar, it's almost too much for me. There is something almost creamy in the background (is it the iso e super?). And then comes the GLOOM: something cold and windy. It's the smell of Vanessa in Penny Dreadful. I'm not sure I like churchy gloomy stuffs.

**Tumbleweed connection :** (sandalwood, leather, sarsaparilla, tobacco, sagebrush, barrel-aged whiskey, vanilla, cedarwood, amber, hemp, rum). Tobacco (but like a cold tobacco smell that lingers on an old leather jacket) and rum rum rum rum rum. Hexennacht is definitely too realistic for my taste! Perfect for Heathcliff in Wuthering Heights.



# DEATH AND FLORAL

**Buried beneath the shallow hay :** (notes : Aging barn wood, the musk of a lingering spirit, old and weathered hay bales) Its more round than A Roll in the hay, a bit green at first but then the green aspect fades and it's all cereals on my skin. Too foody and realistic for me. It's Daisy in the kitchen of Downton Abbey.

**Dancing in the moonlight :** (notes : Cold and sharp autumn air under the moonlight, soft sage, buttery Peru balsam, dark woods) It's like smelling a bunch of different essential oils all together, it's veeeery medicinal. After hours I still felt like I poured my tea tree or eucalyptus essentiel oil all over myself and I had to make a laundry immediately at the end of the day. Perfect for Doctor Clarckson in Downton Abbey.

**Plain Jane** : (notes : Black oudh, fresh morning coffee, rolled tobacco, vegan animal musk, cedar, cinnamon crunch cereal) Coffee coffee coffee, but in a nice way. Like smelling ground coffee strait from the box before making it, not like hot coffee in a cup. Unfortunately it's a bit too realistic for my taste, so that's a no. It's Mrs Patmore in Downton Abbey making coffee for Carlson and Mrs Hughes at the end of the day.

**Queen of moths :** (notes : Incense, rich chocolate, decaying flowers, tobacco, dark woods, attic dust) First I was like ""Oh that's nice ! It's elegant, it's sexy, I think I want to smell like this!"". But then my husband told me ""you smell like our almond milk body wash"". After that I was totally unable to smell something other than my ""Petit Marseillais"" almond milk soap. I picture Anna in Downton Abbey wearing it : nice simple and straighforward perfume (not the classy lady effect I'm looking for but there's nothing wrong about it).

**The library burning down with us** (notes : Burnt edges of books, the overpowering scent of gasoline wafting around the wooden banister, wax candles melting on a desk). I was looking forward to try this one ! But sadly I don't get all the notes that I read about in some of your reviews here. For me it's just caramel pop corn. Same as Queen of moths with the soap: it's like my nose decided ""pop corn"" so I'm unable to smell other notes even when I tried it again few days later... Also perfect for Lydia or Kitty Bennet in Pride and Prejudice.

I wanted to like Death&Floral but it seems the only ones I tried were definitely  not for my nose, it's like they're all single note perfumes to my nose :(



# SOLSTICE SCENTS

**Attic :** (Vanilla, Red Cedar Heartwood EO, Cypress Wood EO, Sandalwood EO, Dried Rose Petals). It's round and sweet, maybe the vanilla, but it's also cold, like a windy attic in autumn (I think it's the cypress wood). But it's a clean attic. It makes me think of an old pot pourri drying in the corner for years (the dried rose petals I think). It's elegant but it gives me granny vibes. Old, but a bit too old. I love grannies but I don't want to smell like a granny, sorry granny. Perfect for Violet Crawley in Downton Abbey.

**Badlands :** (Dry woods, worn leather, dusty fossils, sandalwood, palo santo, hot resins, juniper wood, ponderosa pine cone, parched grasses and desert plants, oud, spices.) Woodsy, dry, spicy, I like it! It's a bit dusty, like powdery but dirtier (it seems I just discovered what ""dusty"" smells like). But then it becomes rounder and a bit peppery (maybe the juniper wood?). The leather is strong and it's too masculin leaning for my taste, but it smells gorgeous on my husband! Perfect for all the Shelby brothers in Peaky Blinders.

**Casting shadows :** (Golden Amber, Nag Champa Incense Accord, Dried Sugar Maple Leaves, Wood Smoke). Ok now I'm a bit confused because I don't get ANY of the notes. Is it the sample or is it my nose? I don't know but all I get is watermelon candy. Is it the Nag champa?? Really confusing. Perfect for... a kid?

**Cliffside Bonfire :** (Conifers, dry woods, rain, saltwater, seaweed, ambergris, charred wood, smoke). I wanted to give another chance to aquatic fragrances, but it seems it's not for me (I already tried Dans le bleu qui petille by Serge Lutens in the past and didn't like it). First it's all damp wood and soil, then I get sea weeds, and later some smoke. It's more like a bonfire extinguished by the rain and the moist from the sea than a full lit bonfire. And unfortunately at the end I only get conifers and it made me think of toilet air freshener :( And I think I don't really like petrichor. It gives old sailor vibes but I don't have any sailor character in mind.

**Estate spirit :** (Dark Rum, Estate Vanilla, Rum Soaked Raisins, Spiced Rum, Bourbon Oak Casks, Buttered Rum, Sugarcane, Orange Peel Bitters). Well it seems that I'm not into boozy stuff neither, at least not on me. It feels like my late Parisian grandpa is in the room with a nice bottle of rum and his tweed jacket. I loved my grandpa but I don't want to smell like my grandpa, sorry grandpa. Perfect for Carlson or Bates from Downton Abbey, at the end of a rough day in the Crawley house. As I'm writing this and reading it to my husband, he just asked me to try it (I told him ""sure, if you want to smell like my grandpa""), and on him it's all rum raisins ice cream and baba au rhum, so now I'm considering eating him. But definitely not made for my skin and not what I'm looking for.

**Farmhouse in summer :** (Fresh cut grass, creamy gardenia, sun-dried linens, country air, sunshine, sunflowers, approaching summer storm). First sniff on my skin in an amazing balance between grass and white flowers. The grass smell is a tiny bit bitter, like when you are picking dandelion with your bare hands and you get the white stuff from the stem all over your fingers. But the bitterness is balanced by the creamy white floral note. And I get the fresh linen but not the approaching summer storm. I love it, it's playful and elegant, but I'm note sure if I'll be able to stomach the strong white flowers notes everyday. I'll have to try it again before considering FS it. It's giving Lady Chatterley running in her estate during a summer day to join the gamekeeper.

**Full Light :** (Vanilla, White Amber, White Orchid, Whipped Cream, Golden Amber, White Velvet). It's divine! It's elegant, feminine, creamy and almost a tiny tiny tiny bit spicy, I loved it immediately and I was surprised that I enjoy vanilla. Until it completely faded after 1 hour. Couldn't smell anything anymore. I tried it again a week later and same problem, it disappeared so soon :( Perfect for Sybil Crawley in Downton Abbey because she's so sweet and elegant but also disappeared too soon (sorry not sorry for the bad joke)

**Gibbon's boarding school :** (Dusty Wooden Desks, Paper, Leather, Amber, Tobacco, Dying Fire, Dried Leaves, Autumn Breeze). I really enjoy this fragrance journey, I get to discover so many interesting and astonishing new kind of smells, and Gibbon's boarding school is definitely one of my favorite ones. It's dusty and papery (now I get what everybody means by ""papery""). There is something sweet in the background (maybe the tobacco). It smells like something elegant, nostalgic, but also full of life and fun. It alternates between powdery (the paper and dusty wood), and then something more blunt and fun (the wood and the leather?). I considered FSing it until I discovered Manor. Perfect for Laurie in Little Women.

**Gin Flower :** (Osmanthus, Elderflower, Apricot, Vanilla, Juniper, Lime, Manuka Honey Accord, Pear, Citron, Hawaiian Sandalwood). I bought this sample for my husband cause he loves Gin & tonic. Well it doesn't give gin & tonic vibes, but it's quite lovely! First I get something kind of fizzy that tickles my nose (Lime and Juniper?). Then it's all sweet and cute and fresh and well it makes me think of a picnic with my girls, with champagne and cakes. Reminds me of the picnic scene in Emma by Jane Austen. I think I have to wear it another day to have a final opinion about this one.

**Lavender vanilla :** (Lavender Essential Oil & Sweet Creamy Vanilla). I had high expectations for this one, because I really love lavender (it reminds me of my late grandmother who lived in the south of France). It's exactly what you can expect : vanilla and lavender. But unfortunately my nose refuses to connect these 2 notes. I recognize the lavender and the vanilla but my brain is like ""you're not supposed to have both together!"". So it's a nope. No character in mind for this one.

**Library :** (Leather Bound Books, A Carved Rosewood Mantle, Dying Fireplace Embers, Wood Wainscoting, Cedar Shelving and Aged Paper). It's suuuuch an interesting fragrance ! It smells old and pricy. The leather is quite strong but in a fancy and mysterious way. I don't get the paper tho, but I can smell WOOD (and well I like wood). It's a bit too masculine leaning for my taste, I didn't FS it but I definitely enjoyed my sample until the end. It's all Mr Darcy or Prince Andrei in War and Peace.

**Manor :** (Woody-Vanilla Musk, Vanilla, Agarwood (Oud), Sandalwood). Oooooook so now I get what woodsy vanilla is supposed to smell. And it's amazing, I get the hype. I love it, I want to take a bath in it, I want to sleep in it. I love how the vanilla is not at all foody, and it seems that after all I enjoy vanilla. It smells like everything I read on this sub : a fancy lady in a fancy manor with fancy flowers and a fancy vanilla candle burning in the corner (not a cheap one). I'm Parisian, I want to be fancy. So yep, I FSd it really quick and now I'm obsessed. Absolutely perfect for Mary Crawley in Downton Abbey (no I don't compare myself to Mary Crawley, I'm just a wannabe Mary Crawley).

**Manor Fire :** (Manor base, Smoke, Charred Wood, Melted Beeswax, Wood Resin, Dry Wood, Burning Leaves, Worn Leather). It's kind of amazing how specific it is to me: it's smells EXACTLY like the few seconds after you just blew a fancy vanilla candle. I like it but it's too smoky and intense for my taste, and I already fell in love with Manor. It gives me Jo March vibes writing in the attic by candle light, because paper and candle and leather and because well she's kind of intense and she could very well burn the whole house at one point.

**Master bedroom :** (Soft Skin Musk, Sandalwood EO, Amber, Clove EO, Somalian Myrrh EO, Vanilla, Aged Patchouli EO and Champaca Absolute). That's a really nice mix between wood, spice and sweetness. I get some clove but it's definitely not as strong as in Seance (see below). It's kind of sexy. But at the end of the day it's a bit too much for me, maybe the patchouli and the champaca, I don't know which one but there is something too intense for me in it. Perfect for Anthony Bridgerton (he's clearly sexy and also too intense).

**Monastic :** (Frankincense, fog, rose, myrrh, labdanum, spikenard, dust). Ok so that's what frankincense and myrrh smell like? Overall it's not a bad smell, it's warm and rich, sometimes it's a bit like in a sauna (where and why do I get this smell???), but too churchy for me. Perfect for... a priest in a sauna? Do I really want to know what a priest in a sauna smells like?

**Parlor Trick :** (Ivory lace, white wax, aged paper, glossy white smoke, teak, black tea, blonde woods, delicate spice, bone musk, Manor and a faint trace of rose). It's powdery, elegant but also sticky??? I think it's the wax. It's creamy, and at the end of the day it's almost a bit boozy. Overall a nice elegant fragrance but no ""waouh"" for me. Maybe for Edith Crawley in Downton Abbey or Meg March in Little Women.

**Queen of dawn :** (Sandalwood, Star Jasmine, Cape Jasmine). On paper it seemed perfect for me, because woodsy and I love jasmin. And it was perfect during the firsts minutes on my skin. Unfortunately after one hour it was only sandalwood and no jasmin anymore so not what I was looking for with this one.

**Scrying smoke :** (Natural and Meditative Melting Frankincense Resin, Frankincense Smoke, Vanilla, Sandalwood, Cedar, Petigrain, Vetiver, Labdanum). It's warm and sexy and complex. It's also elegant. First I get some vanilla and something like dried flowers, then I smell dried oranges slices. Is it the frankincense? At every snif it's something different. But after wearing it during the whole day I think I'm not that into incensy stuff and I felt a bit nauseous. Perfect for Polly in Peaky Blinders.

**Seance :** (Sage, Clove, Frankincense, Patchouli, Sandalwood, Ylang Ylang). It's gonna be a short review. If you like clove, go for it. If you don't like clove, don't go. It seems I don't like clove that much.

**Sirocco :** (Sandalwood, Saffron Threads, Hot Baked Earth, Myrrh, Spices, Oud & Jasmine) Oooooo that's nice ! First it's dry and spicy like Badlands, but then the jasmin takes over and blends very well with all the spices and incense. It's definitely more feminine than Badlands (and without the strong leather), and I'm considering FS it ! Perfect for Kate Sharma in Bridgerton.

**Southern Veranda :** (Lemon, Magnolia, Sun-warmed Grass, Green Tea, Green Leaves, Sparkleberry Flowers, Amber, Antique Garden Roses, Blonde Woods, Warm Soil, Powdered Sugar). I get the lemon straight away but it's more like lemon zest or lemon tree leaves. This one is way less feminine than what I pictured, it's almost bitter and I don't get any of the flowers mentioned. Another one that I gave to my husband afterward. I imagine Tom Branson wearing it in the second Downton Abbey movie, while visiting the French Riviera.

**Spirit Tree :** (Gardenia, Vanilla, Jasmine, Sandalwood, Soft Woods blend, Orange Blossom, Magnolia). So apparently I like white flowers. This one is amazing. There's something very elegant but not too posh. It's definitely feminine and floral, but the vanilla and the sandalwood give just the twist I was looking for. It smells exactly what I imagine when someone in a book says ""She smelled like flowers"". It's giving Elizabeth Bennett in P&P. I might FS it !

**The Mantle :** (Elegant Blend Of Woods, Wood Smoke, Green Tea, Black Tea and Delicate Spices). First hours I was like ""OMG this is it!"". It was the elegant and refine kind of woodsy I was looking for, feminine, spicy, elegant. It made me think of Cecilia Tallis in the movie Atonement. I tried it for two days in a row and unfortunately at the end of the second day it made me nauseous, and I can't smell it anymore since. It seems Cecilia Tallis is a bit too intense for my taste.

**Violet white leather :** (Violet, Vanilla, White Leather, Coumarin, White Musk). This journey is so interesting because I didn't really know before hand what I liked and disliked. Well now I know that I don't like violet that much, so this perfume was at least useful for that! But if you like violet and soft leather (like a nice new leather-bound notebook, not like an old leather jacket from a vintage store) well you'll like this one! I picture Eloïse Bridgerton wearing it.

**Wardrobe :** (Creamy woods blend with cashmere, fur, velvet and a touch of dry woody spices). Oooo it's creamy, I like it ! It smells like a warm clean milky skin, or like a vintage make-up powder. I imagine that's what Marie-Antoinette would smell like. I get a tiny bit of the dry woody spices, but it feels a bit too classic and clean, it doesn't have the twist I'm looking for.

**Wolf Spirit :** (Desert Sage, Pinyon Pine & Resin, Conifers, Cedar, Vetiver, Palo Santo, Soft Incense, Frankincense, Fur & Juniper). First it's all pine and conifers, something cold and windy. Then I smell something sweeter, is it the incense? It's nice but a bit too ""mountain & forest"" for my taste and it seems I'm not really into cedar, conifers, pine, etc. Perfect for Jamie Fraser in Outlander.



**CONCLUSION :** I found my second autumn/winter fragrance with Manor (I immediately full-sized it) and I fell in love with Solstice Scents. And for my spring/summer fragrance I'm leaning towards Spirit Tree, Sirocco or Farmhouse in summer, but I'm not entirely convinced yet : Sirocco is amazing but it doesn't feel entirely ""me"", and Spirit Tree is also gorgeous but it faded quickly after 4 hours and I'm not sure I can stand such strong white flowers notes on a daily basis. Maybe Farmhouse in summer is a good alternative because the grass notes make the white floral more bearable for an everyday perfume. I'll keep trying those 3, so the journey continues !

It was such a nice exercice, trying to recognize notes, finding my way in all these new fragrances, discovering what I like and dislike. And it was fun to try to find the right character for each perfume. By the way fell free to find characters where I couldn't find any, or to suggest other ones! And I'm really curious to hear what you think Mary Crawley or Elisabeth Bennet would wear during the warm seasons :) Thanks and I hope you enjoyed these reviews!",4,1747910434.0,Indiemakeupandmore,0,1.0,False

# History of Indian Wooden Handicrafts

Indian wooden handicrafts have a long history. Back in the day, wood was not just a construction material; it was a medium of art. From the pillars of South Indian temples to the doors of forts in Rajasthan, wood was utilized to share stories of gods, kings, and nature.

During the rule of the Mauryan Empire (around the 3rd century BCE), wood carving was already a popular craft. Later, in the Gupta period, you can read about the use of **wood handicrafts** in both religious and royal places in the texts. After that, the Mughals introduced class and floral style to wooden art. Beautiful inlay work and fine carving became widespread, especially in Kashmir and Uttar Pradesh. Under British rule, Indian artisans tuned into colonial tastes and fused Indian themes with Western.

Even today, rural people keep this wooden legacy alive. Whether it’s the walnut woodwork of Kashmir or the Sheesham designs of Saharanpur, each area has preserved its craft. These traditions are being passed down from one generation to the other to keep this wooden artwork alive.

# Regional Styles and Signatures

The style and signature of wooden **handicraft items** in India change in every village, town, city, and state. As you move from one place to another, the type of wood, the technique of making, patterns, and even the purpose of wooden crafts will not be the same. Here are some local styles and their uniqueness:

https://preview.redd.it/gvrqkowpab2f1.png?width=517&format=png&auto=webp&s=c98029dcd46e9b9cfc2bbad816e79fb9c5c905e2

* **Saharanpur, Uttar Pradesh:** Known as the ""Carving Capital of India,"" this city is celebrated for its floral and geometric designs and lattice work, mainly done on Sheesham wood. More than 1 lakh artisans here are actively working in woodwork to make furniture and decor that’s exported worldwide.
* **Kashmir:** The cold valley is famous for its detailed walnut wood carving, a rare art that takes weeks or months for the completion of a single item. Check out their houseboat furniture and jali design.
* **Rajasthan:** It features vintage polish, bright colors, and illustrations of camels, elephants, and palaces. Teak and mango wood are widely used.
* **Kerala:** Hub of temple-inspired wooden art using rosewood. Kerala artisans create everything from wall panels to swings with spiritual and classical South Indian designs.
* **Karnataka & Tamil Nadu:** Mostly recognized for sandalwood carving of gods, elephants, and decorative boxes. The aroma of real sandalwood is just as ageless as the art itself.

# Types of Indian Wooden Handicrafts

Indian wooden handicrafts are available in various useful forms. Every piece is handmade by artisans with tremendous attention and dedication. Let’s have a look at the main types of wooden handicrafts you’ll find in India:

* **Furniture**: Door hardware, cabinet knobs, coffee tables, key cabinets, chairs, swings, etc., can be bought from shops and online websites. 
* **Sculptures & Idols**: Made from teak, rosewood, or sandalwood, these include Hindu gods, animals, and tribal figures. 
* **Decorative Items**: Wooden bookends, Christmas decor, mirrors, statues & sculptures, accents & wall decor, nauticals, candle stands, curtain holdbacks, tealight candle holders, oil diffusers, picture frames, incense holders, tealight lanterns, animal figurines, flower vases, and wall hangings add character to homes. These are often painted or polished with conventional designs and readily available at [wholesale home decor](https://www.artistrybazaar.com/product-category/decor) websites.
* **Wooden Toys & Games**: Channapatna (Karnataka) and Kondapalli (Andhra Pradesh) are appreciated for toys made using age-old methods, such as chess games, tic-tac-toe, cribbage, labyrinth, backgammon, puzzles, vehicles, money banks, cards & dice, and animals.

* **Utility Items**: Boxes, coasters, spice containers, ladles, walking canes, key chains & key rings, urns, wooden combs & hangers, wooden massagers & back scratchers, yoga mats & singing bowls, and **wooden cutting boards**—all decorated with carvings or inlay work.

# The Making: Tools, Techniques, and Time

The process of making wooden handicrafts in India is a combination of patience, precision, and passion. It all starts with choosing the right wood. It can be teak, sheesham (Indian rosewood), walnut, sandalwood, or rosewood. Each wood has its own qualities. For example, sandalwood is good for its smooth grain and natural fragrance, while walnut is perfect for its dark tone and softness.

Indian artisans use a range of primitive and modern tools. Machines only help with basic cutting or shaping, but the detailed work—like carving, inlay work, engraving, and polishing—is still done by hand. This entire process is time-consuming. It can take days or even weeks to complete a single piece, depending on its size and detail. From selecting the wood, drying it naturally, sketching the design, carving it out, and finally polishing it—every step requires skill.

# Final Thoughts

Indian wooden handicrafts are not just any product on the shelves; they are stories carved by hand. You can place it in your home, office, or anywhere for a dash of class and style and as a reminder of India’s rich culture. If you choose handmade wooden items for your space, you are keeping an age-old craft alive and supporting local artisans. Platforms like **ArtistryBazaar** make it easier to explore and source authentic handmade wooden handicrafts directly from rural artisans to global buyers.

1ksnfjg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthyhooha/comments/1ksnfjg/if_youre_suffering_from_candida_glabrata_read/,"If you're suffering from Candida glabrata, read this! Can't promise a solution but this's what worked for me as a sufferer from chronic yeast infections","I am **not** claiming that I solved it but as a person who's been dealing with chronic yeast infections *exclusively* caused by the stubborn candida glabrata, I wanted to share my experience which could be described as trial-and-error.

I'm extremely prone to stress and that has been the major cause of my recurrent yeast infections. I'm trying to control it but that's easier said than done. When I go through major life-related events, I tend to develop them very very quickly. After trying every azole on the market, these would keep it at bay for some time and then they'd come back since azoles don't effectively work on glabrata.

I eat very healthy, no processed food whatsoever, very little alcohol (*only stick to distilled liqueur when I do, not fermented*) and not on any BC (except conddoms, and only non-latex ones). I incorporate yogurt/kefir/buttermilk in my diet regularly and take oral probiotics every other day for prevention (when I use it as a treatment, it doesn't feel *as* effective). Also sugar is the devil for me and only use some form of a sweetner in my morning coffee. Only stick to 100% cotton underwear and use unscented soap -- no perfume at all! I also air out my intimate area after the shower as much as I can, or sometimes if I can, sleep with no underwear.

Here's what did **not** work when I would have **acute symptoms**:

* Taking probiotics both vaginally and orally. Thus as to why I said that, for me, prevention worked better.
* Azoles of any kind. They help for a while but the recurrence rate is high for me with glabrata.
* Had a bad breakup over the summer last year which resulted in a bad yeast infection episode that looked like the one I had previously so I tried nystatin-based creams based on my GP's advice. They didn't help much and their efficacy wasn't as high for me.

Here's what worked when I'd have **acute symptoms**:

* Last time I had a very bad episode of yeast infection caused by glabrata because of a 7-month use of antibiotics, I tried boric acid (*NutraBlast Boric Acid Vaginal Suppositories*) for the first time for 21 days, per my OBGYN's advise. Kept it at bay for about 3.5 good years. Only had a major outbreak when I used antibiotics again and during that time what helped was a medication called ""Pevisone"" applied **externally**.
* After almost a 8 months period of on-again-off-again yeast infections and especially before my period is due while dealing with the bad breakup, I bit the bullet and tried boric acid again (*pH-D*) for a week. At first I was nervous as the symptoms improved but not as fast as I thought they would. Then about 2 weeks, I barely felt them (*no cottage cheese discharge and the swelling/redness died down*). During this time, I cut my carb intake significantly and went gluten-free just to test if there's a correlation. **Again, the dietary change could very much be a placebo effect.**
* Water and hydration of course.

The reason I say that I *might* have found a solution was because I tested for STDs recently and every single time, like clockwork, every result would be negative except for vaginal candidiasis (*I know it's not an STD, but my lab cultures both bacteria and yeast together so I would know if I have any and what type is causing it -- whether albicans or glabrata*). I did the test because I felt 'off' and the discharge seemed off too and I thought, ""Here we go again, another yeast infection caused by glabrata, I'll never recover from this nightmare!"". Lo and behold, the test was negative! \*\*knock on wood\*\*

For now, that's what has been working for me. I could very much be exposed to it again...who knows since unfortunately there is a no strict medication on the market yet that can eliminate it completely.

P.S: The reason why I waited so long to try boric acid again is because I was afraid to develop some sort of resistance to it so I made it as last resort option. I'm not a MD doctor or a healthcare provider so this is solely based on my personal (and painful) experience with my hooha.",1,1747910121.0,Healthyhooha,0,1.0,False

Like… someone posts, “I want a friend,” and someone comments, “me too,” and then suddenly, you are friends? Does it really wrok like that?

IMO, real friendship needs more than mutual loneliness or shared hobbies  
It needs a story, A vibe. A connection that is felt more than said. Something that makes you go, “Oh yeah, this person gets me”

When I think back, my friendships didn’t start with “let’s be friends.” They started with special moments, like in college when  I thought I might vibe with this nerd guy I sat next to on the first day. We hung out for a week or two, but then I slowly gravitated toward poelple who were more kind of... me, maybe. My people. My tribe. **People who didn’t just like the same things, but liked them the same way I did.**  

And there was this girl in my class who liked chess. I liked chess too. But we didn’t become friends immediately. It actually took months. Then we both showed up for the intercollege chess competition selctions, played a few rounds, talkde about strategies… that’s when it clicked. It was not just about liking chess. It was how we both thought about the game,the level we were at, the strategies we both used , etc

Same with one guy from my class. We both used to talk about colege crushes and random stuff. But over time I noticed we liked the same kind of girls, had the same takes on things that were hapnnnig around us. It wasn not just that we were two guys talking about girls. It was that we kind of saw things the same way. That’s what made it feel like a real connection.

That’s the kind of thing I mean. It is not just about interests.  it’s the depth behind it. The history. The **why** behind the **what**. The vibe you can't fake

So I’m just here, ranting a bit. **does it really work to look for friends just because you want friends?** Shouldn’t it be more accidental.. Or natural? Or at least based on a story that can one day make you both go, “Remember how we met?”  
Would love to hear others takes. Maybe am just overthinking it

I don’t mind if you’re male or female, from my experience in the past I’ve got along with guys easier as it’s been more chilled, no drama, they’ve been my type of funny and it just clicks better but I would really love to have a female friend aswell to get on with because it can be refreshing to have that girl time and girl perspective / advice on things (hopefully without too much judgment) and doing girl stuff, we understand each other on a different level etc. 

I think most importantly, I just want a friendship with someone where it’s 50/50, nobodies being bossy and trying to control the other, just chilled fun vibes. I don’t want to be around narcissistic people. 

My interests/hobbies: all animals (I have two chihuahuas), films/series, documentaries like true crime etc, beach days, picnics, music, singing, colouring (them adult colouring books), swimming, spa days, cinema, zoo, shopping, 420 friendly, cooking, just having a laugh and good time. I like drinking wine sometimes, going out for breakfast/lunch, dinner dates, coffee dates, walks, just chilling together, going to the pub for a drink, play darts/pool, I like to occasionally watch boxing.

You have to be 18+ , I normally get along with people older than me but if you’re around same age as me then that’s cool too.

I bought the beans to replicate at home but I’ve not been able to achieve the same flavours. 

This is the bean flavour notes:
1 creamy sweetness
2 macadamia nuts 
3 fruity acidity 

When I tried it in the coffee shop these were the exact notes I tasted and since experimenting with 3 bags and different outputs, I have not been able to replicate. I would say it definitely has the creamy sweetness but not enough of the nutty and fruity acidity.

The grinder I’m using is a Lagom P64 with omni burrs paired with a Linea Mini R.

From what I remember the grinder the coffee had was a Mahlkonig EK grinder.

My question is why can I not replicate this? Is it just a matter of different burrs, different output? 

If so my second question is would changing the burrs dramatically affect the taste?",2,1747909891.0,espresso,11,1.0,False

1ksnd2a,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_44Toasty44/comments/1ksnd2a/my_first_love/,My first Love,"How do I talk about my first Love, not my first relationship but the first person I really loved. . I guess I'll start with how we met she was dating my then roommate and now best friend/brother at the time.(what I mean by that is he was just a roommate at the time and now after everything weve been through I see him like a brother hell get his own post on here one day).Their relationship wasn't great if I'm being honest she was probably using him at the time. Anyways they broke up but we're staying friends and she kept living with us and I was 24 I think at the time. oh and I was a virgin as well so there's that. I wasn't interested in her at all at first she was my friend's ex after all but as we all lived together and I got to know her one day she told me she was interested in me. At first I said nothing could happen but since we all look liver together I got to know her more and started to develop feelings for her. When I realized this I told my friend and asked him if it was okay and he said it was fine.(Side note it still felt weird so I asked him to punch me cause I felt bad about it and he fucking floored me lol) 

       So we started dating, now she had a kid so obviously she was more experienced than me and I wanted to wait a bit before anything sexual happened.(We did not wait as long as I wanted though and in hindsight if we would of waited it would of prevented a lot of problems) So we started going slow but she lived with us so it sped up pretty fast. She moved into my room since we had another roommate moving in with us. She was my first serious girlfriend. So I was nervous alot but I was happy for a while. So she was a hyper sexual person so we started doing basically everything but actual sex after about a month and then I caved and we started having sex fairly regularly. Everything was great for awhile and yes I think her being my first impacted my feelings for her.

Now this is where everything started to go wrong so we ran into her ex at a store (not my roommate but like an old ex) and he groomed her when she was in highschool or at least that's what she said (honestly after everything was over I don't know anymore but it's important to the story) She slept with him when she was dating his son. When we got home she was upset from seeing him so we stop being sexual for a few weeks then she told me that he messaged her on Facebook ( by the way the story is gonna turn into a lot of me being love blind and stupid now) and he wants to meet up for coffee or some shit. She told me she wanted to go to confront him and get closure. Me being the idiot that I am said that if that's what she needed to then I would support her.She ended up leaving me to be with him. I'm pretty sure she cheated on me when she went to see him but I don't have proof so officially she only cheated on me twice.Niw he was a POS and pedafile and she moved in with him and brought her kid (obviously) but stayed in contact with me cause I was an idiot. She wasnt happy with him and came to hang out with us at the apartment and we all went to themis fair at the mall. We ended up sleeping together that night and she talked about how much she missed me and I believed her since I loved her.She didn't leave him at first however she was basically sleeping with both of us. She broke up with him eventually and moved back in but didn't want to get back together cause she didn't want the label of (girlfriend) but still wanted to have sex. I didn't want to sleep with her since we weren't dating I felt bad for sleeping with her when she was with him and decided not to be like that anymore. So we eventually started dating again but  she didn't want to use labels on it (I know that's a red flag now but I loved her and didn't see it then) I met her family everything was going great at least thought 


I lost my job at taco Bell and it put strain on the relationship she would go back and forth between saying I didnt think about how I would support her and her kid and then when I was applying at jobs she would say she didn't like them cause it would be too many hours and she would never see me we kept arguing about it and her family was going through something so she wanted to go on a ""break"" but she didn't want us to see other people just a break from the relationship.She was still sleeping in my bed and we were still having sex we just we'rnt saying boyfriend or girlfriend.Now one night she comes home and is crying saying she realized she missed me but before we could get back together she had to tell me something she might be pregnant and I asked if it was mine she told me she slept with this guy on tinder but it was anal so he didn't wear a condom but (and this is a bit tmi but it's what she said) he put it in first to lube it before they had anal) and me being an idiot said I still loved her and would be still get back together with her even if it ended up not being mine.

She got me a job at the the gas station she worked at and we just had to hide that we were dating since she was a manager. After a few doctor visits we found out she wasn't pregnant. Everthing was fine til she started saying that my roommate was being weird towards her and trying to sleep with her (yeah he's stivwas and currently is my roommate) but everyone I offered to talk to him about it she didn't want me to.and we eventually started arguing about this because I eventually said I didn't want him hanging out with her and she said he was her friend and I was being controlling.We would argue over this constantly then one day she said that the reason we hadn't been having sex was and she had been feeling so frustrated was because since she was bi she need to sleep a a woman and find want to sleep with men for a while but didn't want to break up so she asked if she got a girlfriend would it be okay.I said no but she eventually told me if I didn't let her she was gonna leave me so I caved. That night she had a girlfriend so I'm convinced she she was already sleeping with her.the girl worked with us ( so did both my other roommates buy the way) one day randomly she realized I was uncomfortable and broke things off with the girl and was with just me again.Til we started arguing over me not wanting her to hang out with my roommate anymore since she said he was flirting with her.She said I was being controlling and couldn't tell her who she could and couldn't hang out with. We got in a big fight at work cause I confronted at work and we both yelled and I walked out my riomate came and picked me up and told me she wasn't flirting with her and that she was telling him that I was being abusive and talking shit about him the whole time. Me and him talked about every out and realized she was manipulating both. She still kept living with us for a while and still shared a room with me but had her own bed.I was still very much in live with her and was trying to get back together with her and we started sharing a bed again.( I know I know shut up). We werenot back together but she was using the fact the I was in love with her to get me to do what ever she wanted.one day this guy we worked with want to have drinks with her and she asked me to babysit her kid so she could on a date with this guy and I said no I thought we were working things out and she said we are it's just a date and everything exploded. We got in a huge argument and I called her a slut and said what are you gonna go sleep with him and if you get pregnant come back to me again.and she stormed out.(I know I shouldn't of said that) anyways I got really drunk while my roommates watched her kid. I left the apartment to go drink I don't drink around kids.She started dating him while STILL SLEEPING IN MY ROOM we weren't sharing a bed anymore though. We were constantly arguing at this point and one day I told her that she needed to move out she said I had to give her 30 days since she had mail here. I told her fine but she need to get her and her kid out of my room.She threw me across the living room and I told her to leave or I'd call the cops. Now I can't remember what it's called but she had that thing where she could bruise easily and she started grab her arm and told me that if I called the cops she'd say I hit her.So I woke up my roommate and told them what happened and then I went to stay with my uncle while she moved out. (By the way I didn't call the non emergency number and asked them what I should do and they told me that if I called the cops they would of arranged me since she was a woman.Thats some bullshit for real)(Also also I should mention I'm 5'4 she was bigger than me) Now I wish I could say this is the end of the story but it's not.

She moved in with the guy and I kept working there (basically out of spite since she couldn't fire me) but eventually it turned out he actually did have anger issues and she started talking to me again.I still loved her at this point as well so she would call me late at night and we would talk.I wanted to get back together and she said she did too but the timing wasn't right she had stuff she need to get ready first but had a plan and would get back with me and we get a place for just us could get married.(Thank God that didn't end up happening) She stayed with him hit was taking to me every night and flirting with me whenever he wasn't around.Oneday I realized that I was being the kind of guy I would hate and told her I couldn't do this anymore.I quit working there and cut contact but I was still in love with her and if she had went to my apartment I probably would of broke down and got back with her. However I ended up dating this other girl and was able to move on. (The other girl is a whole other story where we were both in the wrong) 

Now we're here at today and looking back I see all the time I should of left and stopped everything but I was in love.Also as I mentioned she had a kid that at that point I was helping to raise her kid saw me as a father and I saw her as my own daughter.i helped teach her to talk. That's honestly part of the reason I kept getting back with her is I have always wanted to be a dad and had grown attached to her daughter like I said to me she was my daughter at that point.she clearly knew this as well cause one day I was there waiting for my roommate to get off work and she came in cause someone told her I was there and brother kid to try to get me to start talk to her again and I had to ignithis little girl that I helped raise cause I knew it was fair to me or this little girl.That day broke my heart.

(For an update after I refused to talk with her again she eventually gave up her daughter to her dad and left the one guy for a drug dealer now she works at Burger King and has a other kid) (Also also my friends kid whose a teenager so you know how they are came up to me and told me ""dude she got fat"" I laughed cause at this point I was over her I just think it's funny that he came to tell me that.(I do not think there is a problem with larger women by the way but she used to talk about hating fat people so I do think it's ironic)

Now though looking back I really did love her and the only reason I know this is because I honestly hope she gets some help and gets everything together.I don't want to see her again though because especially with whats going on now.I would unfortunately don't know if I'd be strong enough to not take her bake just so I wouldn't be alone I know I shouldn't and I would just be used again  but she was my first Love and Im going through a lot. Sometimes I feel like her cheating on me was my fault and think what if I deserved it. I think what if she's the best I deserve. I don't want to be with her again but I do hope she doing well 

And I know she doesn't remember me anymore but I hope that girl I raised has grown up happy, healthy and loved.

***Interview with Mark*** **A. Smith, President & CEO of NioCorp**

**Recording date: 12th May 2025**

**NioCorp Developments Ltd. (TSX: NB, NASDAQ: NB) is spearheading a rare example of a fully permitted U.S. critical minerals project. Located in southeast Nebraska, the Elk Creek Project targets four key materials—niobium, scandium, titanium, and magnetic rare earths—all of which the U.S. relies heavily on foreign imports for. With a recent $20 million financing round secured, the company is finalizing engineering studies ahead of a planned Final Investment Decision (FID) by early 2026.**

**CEO Mark Smith, formerly of Molycorp, is leading a seasoned team with rare earth processing experience. NioCorp has already locked in offtake agreements with major players: Thyssenkrupp and CMC Cometals for niobium, Traxys USA for scandium, and is in talks with Stellantis for rare earths. These contracts help de-risk the project and support future cash flows.**

**A major pillar of NioCorp’s funding strategy is an $800 million loan from the U.S. EXIM Bank—backed by bipartisan critical minerals policy initiatives. Additional cost-saving engineering updates—such as eliminating a sulfuric acid plant and switching to ramp access—could reduce overall capex by $300 million versus the 2022 feasibility study.**

**Uniquely, Elk Creek will process all four minerals through one integrated facility, offering diversification and synergies. With construction expected to take three years post-FID and strong support from Nebraska’s government and communities, NioCorp is well-positioned to become a cornerstone of North America’s critical mineral supply chain.**

**In a geopolitical climate prioritizing domestic mineral production, NioCorp stands out as a near-term, strategic solution with clear market demand, proven permitting, and strong institutional backing. It represents a compelling opportunity for investors seeking exposure to electrification, defense, and reshoring themes.**

With the United States and [China ](https://agmetalminer.com/2025/04/22/china-rare-earths-trade-weapon/)ratcheting down the tariff war (for 90 days at least), many expected that the export of rare earths and permanent magnets would soon return to pre-trade war conditions, as [MetalMiner’s weekly newsletter](https://share.hsforms.com/1iF66Eon3RvOrBrboIjEsTgchbup) weighed in on in the past. However, that does not seem to be happening on the ground. Now, alarm bells are going off as market insiders anticipate a major shortage in global rare earth supplies.

# China Allow Some Export of Rare Earths

There is a bit of positive news: China has granted a few export licenses to some companies, including those that supply to European customers. According to a [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/beijing-has-issued-first-rare-earth-magnet-export-permits-volkswagen-suppliers-2025-05-13/) report, this includes a rare earth magnet producer that supplies automaker Volkswagen. Quoting unnamed sources, the report stated that export permits had been issued to a total of four magnet producers, the first since China curbed shipments back in April of this year.

Hopeful analysts see this as a sign that the critical materials will eventually start to flow at a more global level. But even though Beijing may have started approving some exports of rare earths, the actual implementation on the ground continues to delay the processing of these critical minerals. This caused some alarm among manufacturers in auto, defense and other industries that require these critical elements, including those in the U.S.

# Export of Seven Minerals Remains Paused Amid Tariff Truce

A [CNBC report](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/15/china-trump-trade-deal-export-controls.html) said China temporarily paused export restrictions for 90 days following the trade truce, targeting a total of 28 American companies. China first imposed export controls on seven rare earth elements and magnets necessary for electric vehicles, wind turbines and fighter jets in the first week of April. This came in retaliation for the tariff package imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump.

When the 90-day “tariff truce” was announced, many anticipated that the supply situation related to rare earths would ease as well. However, reports on the ground indicate otherwise. China is reportedly carrying on with its export restrictions on seven rare earths, most of which are key to the U.S.’s defense and energy sectors. The list includes Samarium, Gadolinium, Terbium, Dysprosium, Lutetium, Scandium and Yttrium.

One supply chain expert told MetalMiner that while the temporary tariff changes took place on May 14, the full impact of the higher tariffs remains uncertain. He noted that even with the U.S. and China negotiating, trade flows won’t rebound quickly due to widespread order cancellations and shifts in trade routes. His advice: import-export companies should closely track developments throughout the 90-day window, which ends in mid-August.

# Global EV Companies Starting to Worry

A report in the [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/81ba803e-9cce-4752-8432-4dde4e77c691) quoted Wolfgang Niedermark, executive board member of the Federation of German Industries, as saying the window to limit major damage to European production in industries that require rare earths is fast ending. This is despite the fact that Beijing’s commerce ministry recently approved some licenses for exports to Europe after weeks of delay.

Meanwhile, other European experts say the pace needs to pick up. The same report also speaks to concerns U.S. manufacturers such as Tesla and Lockheed Martin have raised in recent investor briefings regarding the supply situation.

# China Blames Export Slowdown on “Endorsements”

Adding to the slow progress is confusion about whether the Chinese have started approving all rare earth mineral and magnet exports to the U.S. following the tariff war ceasefire. China continues to insist that rare earth and magnet importers give assurances that the magnets will only be used in EVs and not for military purposes.

They claim endorsements from governments are delaying the export process, affecting not only manufacturers in the U.S. but also in other countries around the world, like India, a major EV driver.

According to one [report](https://indianexpress.com/article/business/china-curbs-on-rare-earth-magnets-electric-vehicle-makers-face-shortage-approach-govt-10013100/), EV manufacturers in particular are facing a potential shortage of rare earth magnets due to China’s new export restrictions, which include neodymium-iron-boron magnets, which are very important for EV motors, power steering systems, and braking mechanisms. 

# “Unreliable Entity List” Under Scrutiny

Meanwhile, [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/15/china-trump-trade-deal-export-controls.html) reports that in addition to China temporarily deleting 28 U.S. companies from its export control list for dual-use items, granting a 90-day reprieve, it also lifted 17 firms off its “unreliable entity list” for a similar period. Under the Unreliable Entity List regulations, domestic companies can apply to do business with the listed entities.

A [report](https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202505/1334069.shtml) quoting a Chinese Commerce Department spokesperson said these applications will be reviewed by the Unreliable Entity List Working Mechanism, and approvals will be granted if they meet the necessary legal requirements.

https://preview.redd.it/3nxh5qun5b2f1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=44e024e255ca627d64c8e077b62a03cf6b76fd0a

But on the same day, China’s Commerce Ministry emphasized the country’s renewed crackdown on rare earth smuggling, calling for tighter government control over the strategic minerals, citing national security.

Many of the 28 U.S. firms are linked to the defense sector. The first 16 were added to the export control list on April 4, shortly after then-President Trump announced sweeping tariffs on Chinese goods. The CNBC report states that 12 more were added on April 9, a date coinciding with Trump’s pause on tariffs for all nations except China.

Companies exporting dual-use goods from China have to get the green signal from China’s Commerce Ministry even today. Meanwhile, firms on the “unreliable entity list” remain banned from trade or new investments in China.

# India Contemplates Desperate Measures

So desperate is the global supply situation in [India](https://indianexpress.com/article/business/china-curbs-on-rare-earth-magnets-electric-vehicle-makers-face-shortage-approach-govt-10013100/) that some automakers are actually contemplating buying entire electric motor assemblies from Chinese suppliers at the cost of redesigning vehicles to accommodate standard motor sizes. Car makers there have already started discussions with the government to explore alternative sources. However, this process will take time.

# Western Countries Look Beyond China  

Because of [China’s stranglehold](https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rareearths-plants-are-popping-up-outside-china-101747624653759.html) on rare earths, the U.S. and other countries like Brazil are speeding up efforts to mine and refine rare metals. Nobody likes a monopoly, yet China dominates the rare earth industry, mining 70% of global supply and processing 90% of it.

Canadian company Aclara Resources is currently developing a rare earth mine in Brazil and plans to build a processing plant in the U.S. The company already has a buyer on board: VAC, a German firm constructing a magnet factory in South Carolina with Pentagon funding. It is important to note that Brazil has the world’s second-largest rare earth reserves.  

***The U.S. and Europe are also working to reduce reliance on China, with the European Union aiming to process 40% of its critical raw materials domestically. Still, all of these efforts will take at least five years to come to fruition.***

# MAY 21st, 2025~Critical Minerals Supply Risks Mount Amid China’s Grip, Export Curbs

Critical mineral supplies are increasingly concentrated in a handful of countries, with the threat of disruption growing as export bans multiply and diversification efforts face stiff hurdles, according to a report on the sector by the International Energy Agency.

The grip of key players on the market has tightened in recent years. China is the leading refiner for 19 of the 20 strategic minerals tracked by the IEA and accounted for up to roughly 80% of global supply growth of copper and lithium between 2020 and 2024.

“If countries want to catch up with China, they have to make sure government policies are there to support new entrants, both in terms of mining and refining,” said Fatih Birol, executive director of the IEA.

However, capital costs in alternative regions are typically about 50% higher than those for established producers, while a surge in export restrictions–now affecting more than half of the 20 critical minerals–is adding pressure to supplies.

“The uncertainty over tariffs and the broader economic outlook is creating a challenging environment for investors, potentially deterring some critical mineral supply projects, including for minerals like copper and lithium which face medium-term supply deficits,” the agency said.

After the U.S. imposed new tariffs on China last month, Beijing tightened export controls on rare earths, worrying manufacturers and accelerating their search for non-Chinese suppliers. Some rare earth exports have resumed this month, but uncertainty remains high.

“For the time being, we haven’t seen major price increases, but it is not taken for granted that this won’t be a major headache,” Birol said.

“Many countries now are putting an emphasis on critical minerals in trade policies and negotiations…I very much hope that, as a result of that, we will see more diversification.”

Critical minerals are essential raw materials used in high-tech manufacturing, from green energy technologies to artificial intelligence and defense. The term isn’t scientific, but each country defines its own list of critical minerals based on strategic and economic priorities.

Demand for key minerals crucial to the energy transition has surged in recent years, mainly driven by electric vehicles, battery storage, renewables and grid networks. In 2024, lithium demand jumped by nearly 30%–far outpacing the 10% annual growth rate seen in the 2010s–while demand for nickel, cobalt, graphite and rare earths rose by 6% to 8%.

Meanwhile, investment momentum has slowed. Capital spending on critical minerals grew by just 5% in 2024, down from 14% the year prior. Exploration activity plateaued in 2024–marking a pause in the upward trend seen since 2020–and start-up funding began to show signs of cooling.

Among critical minerals needed for the energy transition, copper is one of the most exposed to supply risks. An IEA review of global mining projects–from Latin America to Africa and Australia–points to a 30% supply deficit by 2035, driven by declining resource quality, rising capital costs and limited new discoveries.

“Let’s not forget that it takes about 17 years from the discovery of a mine to having the first product produced,” Birol said. “So we’re seeing major challenges for the availability and price of copper in the years to come.”

Governments worldwide are ramping up efforts to secure critical mineral supplies through public funding, strategic partnerships and policy reforms.

The U.S. issued executive orders to expedite permitting and increase investments in domestic projects, calling for the mining of the deep sea as part of a broader effort to break China’s dominance over the sector. The Trump administration also struck a deal giving the U.S. access to Ukraine’s mineral wealth.

The European Union instead aims to domestically process 40% of the critical materials it requires and set a target to ensure that no single non-EU country supplies more than 65% of its annual consumption for any material on its strategic list.

Birol said governments should play an active role in supporting new entrants with public financing, streamlined permitting and tools to manage price risks. He also emphasized the importance of strategic stockpiling to buffer against potential supply disruptions.

“The key message for me is, as things stand now, given the level of concentration, we cannot rely only on market forces,” he said. “There’s a need for well designed government policies.”

# MAY 20th, 2025~Report to Congress Hypersonic Missile Defense

[Report to Congress Hypersonic Missile Defense - USNI News](https://news.usni.org/2025/05/20/report-to-congress-hypersonic-missile-defense)

*The following is the May 15, 2025, Congressional Research Service In Focus report, Hypersonic Missile Defense: Issues for Congress.*

**From the report**

**The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) and Space Development Agency (SDA) are currently developing elements of a missile defense system that may be able to defend against hypersonic weapons and other emerging missile threats. These elements include the tracking and transport layers of the Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture (PWSA) and various interceptor programs. As MDA and SDA continue to develop these systems, Congress may consider implications for oversight and defense authorizations and appropriations.**

Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) of the U.S. Department of Defense has [published an infographic](https://www.dia.mil/Articles/Press-Release/Article/4182231/dia-releases-golden-dome-missile-threat-assessment/) designed to prove the necessity of deploying the Golden Dome missile defense system by analyzing existing nuclear threats and providing a short-term forecast for the coming five years.

Although the target audience is the Congress members who would have to greenlight spending a truly astronomical cost for the program, currently estimated at $542 billion, the document also presents valuable perspective on modern age threats and particularly on russia's missile capabilities amid its war on Ukraine.

A café, lounge, waiting area, or even a co-working space with flexible entry would work. It’s just for tonight, so I don’t need a full-on office—just something quiet and work-friendly.

Bonus if the place stays open late and has good coffee or snacks.

I started carnivore 11 days ago with amazing results so far. 2.9kg/ 6.3lbs down. I am eating mostly carnivore and all meat types but mostly pork (i prefer it over beef). I normally eat 2/3 boiled eggs in the morning with some meat, mid day some pork belly for fat and for dinner again some fatty meat. I also have milk in my morning coffee and greek yogurt but i stopped the yogurt about a week ago. Sometimes i add beef patties and lamb chops. I also salt my water for electrolytes and keep magnesium (i only took it twice so far).

Last night after having dinner (pork fat and skin with some pork ribs) i started feeling my heart go weird. I would beat slightly higher than normal and i started having palpitations ( one single beat that is extremely hard). Could this be a lack of potassium? I purchased electrolytes just in case and i ate some yogurt last night for potassium. Any advice when it comes to what i eat and why i may be dealing with this?
