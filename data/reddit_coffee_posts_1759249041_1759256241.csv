1nukix5,https://www.reddit.com/r/SoundChecked/comments/1nukix5/should_you_buy_the_best_stand_mixer_aucma/,Should You Buy the Best Stand Mixer Aucma SM-1552NP for Baking,"The Aucma SM-1552NP stand mixer has been a delightful addition to my kitchen toolkit. Let me set the scene: I spend a fair amount of time whipping up treats for family gatherings, DIY pizza nights, and furious weekend baking sessions that leave my countertops dusted in flour. This stand mixer, with its sleek black design and tilt-head build, looked like just the upgrade I needed to replace my worn-out hand mixer.

**Design and Build Quality**  
At first glance, the mixer has a modern and sturdy look. The black finish gives it a polished aesthetic, blending seamlessly with most kitchen decors. Its 8.5-quart stainless steel bowl is a beast, which immediately caught my attention. You can tell this mixer is designed for serious batches of dough and batter. I could easily prep enough bread dough for a small army—or at least a very hungry family of five. Despite the solid ABS housing, the mixer doesn’t feel unnecessarily bulky, though it does have a bit of weight to it which keeps it stable during operation.

**Performance and Power**  
The 900W motor is one of the standout features here. It handled everything I threw its way, from dense cookie dough to fluffy meringues made with egg whites. The motor’s strength means the mixer powers through without overheating, even during extended runs, and I appreciate the peace of mind knowing it has a pure copper motor for durability. There’s something satisfying about watching the dough hook knead effortlessly while I sip on coffee. 

**[See Aucma SM-1552NP deals on Amazon now.](https://ultimodule.com/p/b0dnmjnwsw/)**  

**Ease of Use**  
This mixer isn’t just power—it’s also practical and user-friendly. The tilt-head design makes accessing the mixing bowl a breeze. Whether I’m swapping in the beater or dough hook, the process is seamless, and the attachments lock into place securely. The six-speed rotary control, paired with a pulse function, gives the perfect amount of customization, though I admit I usually hover between medium and high speeds when whipping cream. Plus, the splash-proof cover is a game-changer for messy mixtures. No more powdered sugar clouds coating my countertops.

**Highlights**  
- The large capacity bowl is perfect for big batches and busy kitchens.  
- Dishwasher-safe attachments make clean-up quick and effortless.  
- Low noise operation keeps the peace in my typically busy household.  

**Negatives**  
That said, no product is without its quirks.  
- The item is on the heavier side, which makes moving it a two-handed job.  
- I noticed the speed selector dial has a bit of resistance—I would’ve loved smoother control.  

**Product Contenders**  
Considering its affordable nature, this mixer goes toe-to-toe with some well-known competitors. The KitchenAid Artisan series, for example, holds a more premium spot in terms of design and reputation but doesn’t always justify the hefty price tag. While KitchenAid has a more refined feel, the Aucma stands out for offering similar functionality at a fraction of the cost. On the other hand, certain budget alternatives like some Hamilton Beach models tend to skimp on motor power, whereas this mixer dominates with its 900W prowess. If you’re weighing features, the Aucma gives you bang for your buck thanks to its durability and performance.  

**Bang for the Buck**  
What really seals the deal for me is its value. It bridges the gap between luxury mixers and budget alternatives, offering a price-to-quality ratio that feels just right. Sure, it’s an investment compared to hand mixers, but the time and effort saved make it worth every dollar spent, especially for home chefs doubling as part-time bakers. The powerful motor, spacious bowl, and ease of use make the product feel far superior to its cost. For anyone unsure about whether they need a stand mixer to handle large-scale cooking and baking, this offers an excellent starting point without breaking the bank.

4. Coffee at home on weekdays. Kept weekends out.  
5. Walk or bike for short errands. Gas dropped from one hundred eighty to one hundred twenty.  
6. Clothes freeze. We use what we have.  
7. Returns discipline. Keep receipts and photos, return fast if we will not use it.  
8. Checkout habit. Clip store app offers. Pay with a same day egift for the exact total. I sometimes use Snaplii for that, 30% credit on first purchase, code in seconds, credit back right away. I only buy what I will use today.

1nukiq4,https://www.reddit.com/r/PCRawData/comments/1nukiq4/explore_if_the_huion_hs610_graphics_tablet_lives/,Explore if the Huion HS610 Graphics Tablet Lives Up to the Hype,"Testing out the Huion HS610 was like stepping into a whole new world of creativity. As someone who spends hours crafting digital illustrations, having a reliable graphics tablet is non-negotiable. This tablet immediately caught my attention with its clean design and promising features, so I had to dive in and see what it could truly do.

**Design and Build Quality**

The Huion HS610 isn't just functional; it's stylish too. The slim profile and lightweight structure make it incredibly portable, which is great for someone like me who likes to draw in coffee shops from time to time. Despite its lightness, it doesn’t feel fragile. The matte surface not only resists fingerprints but also mimics the texture of paper, which makes long sketching sessions much more comfortable. The 12 programmable keys and touch ring are neatly placed, and I found customizing them according to my needs felt intuitive. 

[Check Huion HS610 price on Amazon.](https://pasprog.com/p/b08rhmrfm3/)

**Performance and Usability**

This tablet showcases an exceptional performance level. The tilt functionality allows for up to ±60 degrees of brush tilt, which blew me away when I tried shading subtle gradients in my artwork. The stylus is battery-free—something I didn’t think I’d appreciate as much as I do. The freedom of never having to charge the stylus is such a relief; I’ve had too many creative flows interrupted by dead pens. Plus, the responsiveness and pressure sensitivity make it easy to create precise, natural strokes.

**Good Points**

- The touch ring is a game-changer when zooming in or out of your canvas or adjusting brush sizes.
- Android device support opens up a lot of possibilities; pairing my phone allowed me to sketch ideas on the go.
- A matte paper-like surface that offers comfortable drawing sessions.
- Battery-free stylus with great pressure sensitivity delivers an authentic drawing experience.

**Software Compatibilities**

Configuring this device with various software tools was largely hassle-free. It supports popular programs like Photoshop, Illustrator, and Krita with seamless integration. If you’re jumping between Windows, Mac, and Android like I often do, compatibility is not an issue. The Android capability was intriguing, but I have to say it’s a bit tricky with certain apps. Oh, and don’t get me started on the Samsung Note Series issue. It's disappointing that the cursor doesn’t show up unless you’re using specific Samsung devices.

**Areas for Improvement**

- Limited compatibility with iOS devices can feel restrictive for some users.
- The cursor issue with most Samsung devices diminishes the portability advantage.
- Occasional hiccups in touch ring gestures right after tablet setup.

**Target Audience**

I see this as an excellent choice for aspiring digital artists and professionals who are seeking something versatile yet budget-friendly. While the tablet is powerful, it manages not to intimidate beginners. My friend, who recently started exploring digital art, tried it out, and they found the programmable keys incredibly helpful.

**Competing Products**

Comparing the Huion HS610 to some of its competitors like the Wacom One, I found a few key differences. The Wacom provides a slightly more polished drawing surface but comes at a higher cost. XP-Pen models are another contender, offering similar Android support but lacking the same tilt functionality that Huion aces. Where the Huion excels is in combining price and high-end features like a battery-free stylus and a touch ring, elements that elevate the drawing experience despite some minor setbacks.

**True Value**

Considering all its rich features, the Huion HS610 offers a fantastic price-to-quality ratio. It’s perfect for someone who’s budget-conscious but doesn’t want to compromise too much on tech specs. Naturally, there are higher-end tablets on the market, but this model is a solid middle ground between affordability and functionality. The experience of working on this device proves you don’t have to spend a fortune to get professional-grade features.

For the past several weeks/months, I have been dealing with severe insatiable hunger and I am not sure what to do about it. In general I eat a balanced diet. High protein, mostly whole foods. Some main staples of my diet are eggs, bananas, beans, nuts, protein powder, vegetables, rice, etc. I'm fairly active, I run about 15-20 miles a week split across 3-4 days and lift 5 days a week. I take one active rest day per week.

The thing is, I'm never satisfied. I'm always thinking about my next meal. Planning it. Buying food. Meal prepping. If I'm with friends I go out of my way to get food out. I'm always seeking food. If I visit family I make sure they make me a meal and am disappointed if they don't. If I go too long without eating I get a bad attitude and either completely mentally zone out or will have to literally physically leave the situation because I can't be mentally present. I think this is what people mean when they say food noise. Basically all I think about is food. I know this isn't normal because I also eat more than other people.

My cravings are for different things, but most often I crave eggs. Sometimes I crave Greek yogurt or avocado. Which makes me think it's like a fat specific craving? But I also crave protein bars and protein cookies a lot. So maybe protein? But that doesn't make a ton of sense because I eat more than my body weight in grams of protein per day. There are also some days when I crave coffee more than food. I am not sure why except I am very fatigued often and have headaches sometimes so I guess that kind of explains it. I have a pretty high caffeine tolerance.

The reason I'm so concerned about the hunger is because I've been diagnosed with PCOS. Currently my blood sugar and insulin levels have been totally fine, but my symptoms are concerning me. I tried myo inositol and birth control and both made insatiable and rapidly gain weight (I went from 120 to 130 and am finally back down), but now I'm experiencing the same thing even in the absence of added hormones/supplements. I've gained .5 lbs in the past week and am struggling to keep myself from eating over 3000 calories every single day. I also cannot sleep through the night. I tend to fall asleep easy enough, sleep about two hours and then wake up every hour for about 3 more hours and then don't sleep more. I often wake up dreaming about food.

What's going on? Like I said, all my bloodwork and hormones are totally fine, I just have low estrogen and progesterone, so no ovulation and no periods for about 14 months and ovarian cysts. But everything else (and I mean everything... cortisol, thyroid, electrolytes, even had an mri) was tested and normal. It's like there's no medical explanation I just can't get full. And I am gaining weight.",3,1759255331.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

1nukc0d,https://i.redd.it/hdhnbdqvccsf1.jpeg,What helped me actually sit down and study 6-7 hours daily,"As I started to study daily for the past 6 months I noticed some small things that made a HUGE difference in staying consistent

Here are some methods that helped me:

**Morning setup** before I sleep I always leave my desk ready for tomorrow (notebooks, pens, laptop charged). Waking up and seeing everything set up makes it easier to just sit down and start

**Tiny daily challenge** instead of telling myself - study for 6 hours, I set a mini challenge like just 25 minutes of focused study. 90% of the time once I start, I keep going.

**Accountability + punishment** this was a game changer. Me and a friend agreed every day we had to log at least one focused study session. If we failed we had to do a punishment task (writing an embarrassing sentence in our chat). The fear of punishment was actually funny but it kept us consistent.

**Studying with strangers** at some point I even joined challenges with people I did not know personally. Weirdly enough it worked coz seeing random people also pushing through their tasks made me feel part of something bigger.

**Breaks with rules** I take breaks every 50 minutes but the rule is no scrolling on my phone. I either stretch, walk or drink water. This keeps me from losing momentum.

**Rewards** I give myself small rewards after finishing a tough session (watching 10 minutes of a show, eating a snack I like). It sounds simple but it really tricks my brain into looking forward to study time.

**Movement + posture** standing up, stretching my shoulders, doing a quick set of pushups etc these little things reset my brain and energy more than coffee sometimes.

**Sleep > all-nighters** I used to think pushing until 3am was productive. Honestly, my grades improved once I started prioritizing a full nights sleep. Memory and focus are way sharper.

What I learned is that consistency beats motivation. For me it helped to think of studying like little daily challenges instead of huge goals. Sometimes Id even add a funny rule or punishment just to make it more interesting. And doing it together with other people even if its just keeping each other updated, makes it feel lighter and less like a chore.

If anyone is interested I can also share some of the study techniques I use (like active recall and spaced repetition).",1,1759255237.0,GetStudying,0,1.0,False

1nukb88,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1nukb88/they_said_i_wasnt_good_enough_for_him_9_years/,"They Said I Wasn't 'Good Enough' For Him. 9 years later, we're married with a daughter.","I didn’t expect to fall in love during training week at a BPO floor in Makati, especially not with the quiet guy in the corner who laughed the first time I begged him to let me nap instead of shadow his calls.

What I didn’t see coming was that same guy, Adrian, would end up estranged from his father because of me. His father’s a well-off businessman, the type who plays golf on weekends and thinks subdivision gates are proof of superiority. Adrian was already the black sheep in that family, introvert, gamer, the son who didn’t play the part. I was the final nail in the coffin. The “call center girl from the wrong side of Makati.”

And if you’re still reading, maybe you’re wondering: *How does something like that even happen?*

So let me go back.

The floor smelled like moldy carpet and stale coffee reheated one too many times. Add to that the sharp perfumes everyone wore, and my sinuses were a full-on battlefield. Allergic rhinitis—my curse. My eyes watered so much I looked like I’d been crying.

“*Ellaine, meet Adrian*,” my trainer said, leading me to the farthest cubicle like it was a shrine. “*Top performer. Three months straight.*”

There he was. Headset looped around his neck, posture like he wanted to vanish. Corners were safe for people like him.

The trainer left me there. I sniffled, sat down, and leaned toward him.

“*Look, I feel like hell. Allergies. Pwede bang ipikit ko lang sandali mata ko and pretend I’m learning?*”

He turned, slow. Unsure if I was joking. A twitch at the corner of his mouth.  
“*You’re in training. You’re supposed to learn, not nap.*”

“*I learn better with my eyes closed,*” I muttered.

He chuckled. Just once. Low. But it landed. God, it landed.

**After that, I kept drifting back to his corner. Partly because my trainer encouraged it, mostly because I wanted to. Then something just blossomed.**

He wasn’t like the other tenures who puffed up their chests and treated newbies like fresh meat. He didn’t brag. He didn’t sugarcoat either. He just… gave you what mattered.

“*Ayan nagalit si customer kasi you didn’t set expectations*,” he told me once. “*Think of them like bosses. They don’t care if you’re new. They care if you waste their time*.”

“*Wow, parang HR handbook,*” I shot back, blowing my nose.

He smirked, and that smirk made the whole damn floor feel smaller.

Then one night, the rain drowned the city. Grab drivers canceled. Cabs disappeared. Half the floor had gone, but Adrian and I stayed, waiting for the rain to be still.

“***You’re not getting home tonight***,” he said, calm as fact.

“***Neither are you***,” I countered.

He shrugged. “*My apartment unit is walking distance.*”

I'm not sure how and what led us to it but by midnight, we were in his unit. Small. Clean. PC glowing like a shrine. He lent me a shirt that hung loose, and I tried not to think about how domestic it felt.

We sat, talking in low voices while rain hammered the glass. Work. Games. Family. The stuff you only say when the world outside is muted.

“*I’m not good at this,*” he admitted, eyes on the storm.

“*At what?*”

“*Letting people in*.”

I should’ve made a joke. Instead I said, “*Good thing I’m good at barging in.*”

That was the first time he kissed me. Steady, sure. The kind that leaves you weak even sitting down.

That’s where it should’ve ended, two call center kids carving out warmth against the city’s chaos. But life doesn’t tie up neatly. Especially when pride and family get involved.

Adrian’s father found out about me.

And if you’re imagining shouting matches—no. It wasn’t drama. It was silence. The kind that slices deeper. His stepmom decided I wasn’t enough. Or maybe too much. Wrong neighborhood. Wrong shoes. Wrong paycheck.

One night I told him: “*You should fix it. Tawagan mo. Mag initiate ka. Don’t waste your family over me.*”

He held my gaze and said: “***Maybe they were just waiting for a reason to cut me off. Maybe you were just convenient***.”

**And that was it. No fight, no reconciliation. Just nine years of silence. Like a funeral, except no flowers.**

We got married anyway. Not a glossy-magazine wedding. Civil lang. City hall. A handful of people. One pair of godparents. The kind of ceremony over before lunch if the paperwork is straight.

I wore simple white. He wore a polo shirt, and he didn’t care but boy he looked neat. The judge read lines like a grocery list. But when Adrian slipped that ring onto my finger, the world blurred and all I could see was him.

No chandeliers. No 200-guest buffet. Just us.

Later we ate with those same few people. No videographer, no prenup shoot in Tagaytay, no string quartet. Just laughter, clinking forks, and a stripped-down kind of joy.

And I wouldn’t trade it. Because for us, love was never spectacle.

It was showing up.

In a musky-carpeted training room where I begged him to let me sleep.  
In a unit lit by storm and LED glow.  
And later, in that city hall office where our names got written down side by side—no fanfare, no applause.

Just permanent. And now we’re blessed with a 1-year-old daughter and a marriage that’s been strong and joyful than it has been.",0,1759255195.0,offmychest,0,0.5,False

1nuk7ui,https://www.reddit.com/r/tmobile/comments/1nuk7ui/how_to_submit_feedback_on_phone_agents/,How to submit feedback on phone agents?,"It’s a big hit or miss when it comes to solving a customer problem at T-Mobile on a live phone call. 

Some agents (few actually), don’t seem helpful at all the way they talk, don’t know where to look, not good at their jobs when it comes to escalating or knowing where to look. They give up and say it is what it is. 

Some agents great at talking, but give wrong advice, wrong info basically and convinces you to upgrade lines or buy a phone or do something. I don’t think these agents are nefarious. Just think these agents are very confident when they are wrong. I personally ask them to triple check, ask them to read the exact line or internal document number, meaning more work for me.

Some agents (the best ones) are not only great at talking but absolutely amazing at solving problems. These representatives are the ones that make me stay with t-mobile and I always let them know they are the best. They would fix the errors made by the other agents, be kind, and also ensure all your issues are tackled, add sufficient documentation and logs to the calls and do it right. They are the reason I stay with t-mobile. They even follow up with me. 


So if an issue seems messed up, just cancel the call and dial back again until you find the right agent.

I personally don’t care about providing feedback on bad agents. But I ABSOLUTELY want to convey the positive feedback on agents to their supervisor or management — how do I do that? 

1. Is there a way for me to provide positive feedback on my best support agents? 

2. Is there a way I can Venmo a small coffee or a cash tip as a thank you?

1nuk4dn,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1nuk4dn/the_truth_about_my_sobriety/,The Truth About My Sobriety,"I've been alcohol free for 636 days now. I stopped initially because I had been drinking a lot over the holidays and wanted to do a dry January. At the time, I was 30 and needed to make some changes in life. That first month turned into a 90 day challenge, then it turned into seeing if I could go a whole year alcohol free. Well, here I am almost 2 years later. I've never been in AA or any recovery community, just basically will power and my own ""all or nothing"" stance I tend to take on things.

I was the kind of guy who would sometimes have a tough time moderating, but never really ""craved"" alcohol. Never drank alone, only socially. But I learned how to drink in the binge days of college, so it was natural for me in certain settings to ""get after it"". Every time wasn't like this, but there definitely were times over the years where I got way too drunk and did stupid, regrettable things.

Fast forward to now...I've definitely matured and grown as a man and got to really know myself outside of being a party guy stuck in a college-aged cycle. I've needed time to get sober and grow up. There have obviously been some incredibly rewarding elements to sobriety, such as health, stability, etc., but the social aspect has taken a big hit. Recently, I was at a good friends wedding with all of my best friends who live all over the country. I haven't seen some of these guys for a couple of years. They'd stay up and have some beers, clown around, and I'd be in bed at 10. In the mornings over coffee I'd get to hear all the banter I missed out on. Sure, you could say ""why didn't you just grab an NA beer and join them"", but those who get it, get it. At a certain point in those nights, you start to feel like a tag-along trying too hard to fit in. It was easier for everyone if I just let them go do their thing.

Reflecting on this experience has made me feel sad, and wonder if I'm ""white-knuckling"" this sober experience too hard. As I mentioned before, I have a tendency to be all-or-nothing on things, and I can indeed be pretty stubborn. I feel stuck because part of me wants to try the age old ""healthier relationship"" with alcohol, but the other part of me feels like inevitably over time it becomes more of a habit. Like once you see booze for what it is, can you actually go back and enjoy it? I also read about people saying it just genuinely isn't fun anymore once you've been sober long enough. Generally, I like being sober, but during social events it sucks big time. Psychologically, the ""never drinking again"" thing messes with my head too. In a perfect world I could have a few on weekends like this and feel normal, but I know that opening that door back up is a risky one and I don't take it lightly.

Anyways, just wanted to keep it real. Appreciate the community and everyone sharing their stories. I've been coming here to see if anyone has successfully dipped their toes back in and it seems like they haven't...but I suppose if it did go well they wouldn't post here lol.",4,1759254771.0,stopdrinking,1,1.0,False

UPBRINGING

Cassidy grew up quiet, often lost in books or games, and was bullied in middle school for her reserved personality and looks. When she discovered Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, it gave her confidence, discipline, and a sense of belonging she couldn’t find at school.

Around the same time, she began streaming casually, sharing clips of her gaming sessions. To her surprise, people connected with her calm commentary, dry humor, and authenticity. What started as a small hobby grew into a niche online community where she could express herself without fear.

Her gamer life and martial arts training balance each other: streaming allows her to open up socially in a safe way, while BJJ keeps her grounded, disciplined, and strong.

Not in the classical sense atleast, not in a material or physical sense… Sure Im typing this, sipping my coffee getting ready for a workout & then Ill go to my job, but this is all a facade. I was given a name at birth, ive went by nicknames, I carry a family name, but at the end of the day it means nothing to me. My existence will be swept away by eternity, & eventually after I pass there will be nothing to remember me by…

So its all pointless. 

It used to drive me insane & throw me into the depths of depression. However after sitting with this for so many years, feeling it in my bones, I now understand that this pointlessness is the closest thing to ‘freedom’ that i’ve ever experienced. I can still love & exist within this moment despite the void. 

I don’t have to do anything, I don’t have to be anyone. 

It seems natural to yearn for a purpose but I don’t need a divine purpose. Any purpose is fine, & when I find it I will cling to it for as long as I can. Having entirely no purpose is still a scary thought for me but life still persists, you can make your own purpose. Its gonna be fine.",3,1759254581.0,DeepThoughts,4,1.0,False

Prologue 1978

The last warmth of summer still lingered in the fields that ringed Ashgrove the night Mystic Land opened its gates.  The sunset above the flatlands had curdled into a bruise-colored violet, and the fairground’s plywood turrets—painted in chalk-pale crenellations—loomed out of that twilight like some toy citadel abandoned by a careless giant.
 Daniel Harker, then only eight, sat pressed to the window of his father’s rattling station wagon as the two-lane road wound between corn that stood shoulder-high and stirred with a wind he could not feel on his own cheek.  Now and then the breeze bent the tassels eastward in one synchronized ripple, as though the entire field inclined its head toward the castle.  From far ahead drifted the wheeze of a calliope—cheerful yet plaintive, like a children’s march played on the lungs of a funeral organ.
 He was not alone in the back seat.  Beside him leaned Cassie Lorn, small and dark-haired, already sketching shapes with her fingertip against the fogged glass.  Eli Mercer, thin-limbed and restless, drummed his knuckles on his knees.  Jordan Hale, taller and sturdier than the rest, craned to see the colored lights ahead with a grin that dared the night to scare him.  The youngest, Ty Bennett, clutched a paper sack of penny candy like a talisman and tried to hide the tremor in his hands whenever the calliope’s notes dipped too low.
 Their parents, charmed by the promise of one last carnival evening before the school term, spoke of tickets and rides and how harmless the new attraction was said to be: “A quest for the young and bold—seek the Goblin King’s golden key!”  A smiling harvest moon was painted above the ticket-booth, its crescent grin so wide it seemed to share a private joke with the gathering dusk.
 The gravel lot glittered with strings of low-watt bulbs that looked feeble in the deepening violet, like fireflies trapped in cloudy glass.  The children tumbled from the car and felt the crunch of stones under their sneakers while the castle gate, at first a distant cardboard façade, appeared to draw nearer with every step although the arch itself never widened.  Cassie whispered that the turrets seemed to lean closer each time she blinked.
 Beneath the archway stood a mechanical court-jester, lacquered smile gleaming wetly in the lamp-light.  At the tug of some unseen belt the figure bent in a jerking bow so sudden its bell-capped head nearly flew from its wooden neck.  One painted eye gazed dutifully upon the queue while the other strayed outward, glassy and unfocused.  From a hidden speaker its laughter rattled out too slowly, like a phonograph winding down on a spent spring.
 The first hallway glowed with murals of cherubic sprites, page-boys, toy dragons and rosy-cheeked dragon-slayers, all parading toward a golden-thorned crown said to belong to the Goblin King.  The pigments were bright yet bore a waxy sheen that reminded Daniel not of paint but of something damp that had grown across the wall and been varnished in place.  Beneath the sweet varnish lingered a faint smell of wet hay after rain.
 Beyond the gate the revels were innocent enough—foam-lance jousts, a lute-strung hall lit by rows of paper lanterns.  A gentle pastoral tune piped from hidden speakers; still, a slanted note in its lullaby-like cadence raised gooseflesh on Daniel’s arms, as if some long-forgotten warning were woven into the rhythm.  Yet they laughed and chased each other past wooden steeds, eager for the great adventure the banners promised deeper inside the ride called “The Dragon’s Lair.”
 They queued between velvet ropes, breathing the warm scent of candied nuts, while a weary attendant in a mottled waist-coat assured the parents there had been “only a small mechanical hitch in the King’s Hall.”  The children were packed two by two into painted drake-shaped cars that creaked forward on their iron rails beneath papier-maché arches of stalactite and foam-stone battlements.  Glow-painted stars winked overhead as the cars slipped into the cool interior.
 Halfway through the tunnel the music faltered.
A hiss of hidden hydraulics stirred the animatronic dragon ahead—its rubber tongue twitched—and then every lantern guttered out at once, leaving a hush so complete they could hear each other’s breaths quicken.  A red emergency strobe sprang to life, beating through the blackness in uneven throbs like a wound that would not close.  Under that crimson wash the murals of knights and sprites appeared to leer; the dragon’s painted jaws, which had hung slack a moment before, seemed to glisten with fresh saliva.
 In one of those fever-bright flashes Daniel thought he saw a tall crowned figure pressed impossibly flat against a cracked mural of the Goblin King’s throne-room—arms stretched as if bracing itself between the painted pillars.  The crowned head turned a fraction toward him; what passed for a mouth seemed to widen far past the hinge of its jaw before the strobe blinked again and the wall was only wall.
 Children shrieked; one of the cars lurched backward on the track.  Parents shouted over the hiss of the hydraulics while attendants herded the riders out through a side-door into the night air.  Sirens joined the din—first the park’s own alarm, then the sharper ululation of county cruisers racing down the gravel road.  Beneath that clamour Daniel imagined he still heard the calliope wheeze the quest-march again at half-tempo, each note drawn out as though pressed from a drowning bellows.
 When at last they stumbled outside, the turrets of Mystic Land looked ashen in the search-lights and, to Daniel’s eyes, far older than they had an hour earlier—like ruins long buried and lately unearthed.  By dawn the sheriff’s men were combing the funhouse for three children who had vanished between one chamber and the next.  They found no garments torn on the rails, no trace of blood—only a soggy paper crown caught in a drainage grate, its gilt flaking away like peeling scabs.
 Daniel stood with Cassie behind the barrier tape, shivering despite the sticky summer night, staring at the jagged crack in the throne-room mural where he swore the crowned shadow had leaned forward to watch him pass.  Years later, even as a grown man, he could never decide whether that glimpse had been no more than a trick of the strobe-light and a boy’s fevered dread—or whether something in that painted stone had indeed turned its gaze upon him.



Chapter one – Autumn Reunion, 1987

October pressed down on Ashgrove with a raw, rain-soaked gloom, the kind that dulled the cornfields to sepia husks and turned the two-lane highway into a long wet ribbon glistening beneath the streetlamps. The old fairground lay past the outskirts, lost to weeds and fog, its wooden gates rotting under a sagging arch that still bore in chipped paint the words MYSTIC LAND—though the color had long since bled away.
 On the town’s main street a single neon sign—Murphy’s Diner, the bulb-shaped cup forever tipping its electric steam—flickered against the puddled asphalt like the last ember of a dying hearth. Inside, the air smelled of scorched coffee, damp wool coats, and the metallic tang of loose change counted too often by weary hands. The ceiling fan squeaked in an uneven rhythm that no one seemed to hear anymore.
 Daniel Harker stepped in from the rain with his collar turned up and his reporter’s notebook in his pocket, though tonight he carried it more as a shield than for work. The heat inside fogged his glasses and he paused to wipe them clear before scanning the rows of cracked vinyl booths. A thin man waved to him from the corner—the familiar slouched figure of Eli Mercer, hunched over a coffee he had allowed to go cold. Eli’s narrow face, all hollow cheeks and that one unruly lock of brown hair, had grown older than his years, as though the hardware shop he ran had slowly drained the color from him.
 Across from Eli lounged Jordan Hale, the broad-shouldered ex-linebacker now dressed in a scuffed leather jacket that still carried the scent of oil fields and diesel. He grinned at Daniel with that same crooked half-smile from high-school days, yet the years had hollowed something behind it; the grin passed like a sun-flash behind a ragged cloud. Beside him sat Cassie Lorn, her blunt-cut black hair tucked behind one ear as she traced idle shapes in the condensation of her mug. Ink stains on her fingertips betrayed the sketch-work that barely paid her rent these days. When she looked up her eyes had the distant watchfulness of one who had grown accustomed to seeing what others missed.
 A gust of damp air marked the arrival of Ty Bennett, rain still beading on his jacket shoulders, his boot tapping a restless rhythm against the diner’s linoleum. He had bulked up from years on logging crews, yet there clung to him a certain boyish wariness, as if he still half-expected to be startled by shadows. He nodded curtly to Daniel, slid into the booth beside Cassie, and wrapped chilled fingers around a fresh mug of coffee.
Their greetings were brief, almost guarded—old friends drawn together by a single dark memory that each pretended, at first, to have outgrown. The talk drifted across jobs, debts, lost apartments, and the half-mended lives they carried. But in every lull the silence pointed toward the thing none dared name: the funhouse. Mystic Land had been shuttered for ten years, yet in their memories its painted turrets and cardboard ramparts still rose against the fairground dusk, bright at the entrance and ever darker the deeper one went. They had entered it as children on a dare one summer evening—and come running out shrieking, though they could never agree on what they had seen.
A bent figure in a frayed rain-coat lingered near the counter, warming his hands around a chipped cup. His eyes were small and pale as fish-eggs, and when he noticed their glances he shuffled nearer, as if drawn by the gravity of their hushed conversation. His voice rasped like damp kindling when he spoke.
“You folks talking about the old park,” he said, his gaze roaming over them—curious, but with something almost covetous in the way it lingered on their faces, as though he measured how deep their memories went. “Place’s been closed near a decade, but the stories… those don’t ever close.”
No one answered at first. At last Daniel cleared his throat. “We were just remembering it. Mystic Land. You know much about it?”
 The old man’s cracked lips twitched as though around a half-forgotten prayer. “I know what people say. They say the fella who built it—had a boy, bright little lad, loved to run the corridors before the park opened. One summer the boy wandered off into that medieval funhouse they called the crown jewel. Never walked out again.”
He drew closer, his breath carrying the bitter edge of stale whiskey. “They say they searched all night, lantern to lantern, till dawn burned the fog away. Never found a trace. Not a shoe, not a drop of blood. Only the echoes in the mirrored halls. The father changed after that. Folks say he sealed the deeper rooms himself, hammer in hand. But children kept going missing every couple years—most from the county fair crowds. And some who came out swore the funhouse halls were different each time, as if the place shifted to swallow what it fancied.”
 Cassie lowered her eyes to her mug. Ty’s tapping boot went still.
The man’s voice dropped further. “When the county finally shut the place down—said it was unsafe, rotting beams and such—the sheriff found scratches on the inside of some of them doors. Scratches high up, like from a child’s nails.” His gaze passed over each of them in turn. “Ain’t my story. Just a legend, told a thousand ways. But every version says the same: the boy who vanished in Mystic Land never truly left it.”
For a moment the diner seemed to grow quieter around them, the ceiling-fan’s squeak the only sound. Rain streaked the window in crooked lines that made the streetlights outside blur and bend, as though the world itself were warped by some unseen ripple.
 The old man finished his coffee and shuffled back to his stool without another word. Daniel found that his pen had slipped halfway from his pocket—he had nearly reached for it on instinct to record every word. Instead he pushed it back down, feeling an unease too deep for notes.
They lingered over their cups as the rain fell harder, each secretly tracing the remembered path through Mystic Land’s bright painted gate: the cheerful dragons and jesters near the entrance, the cobbled corridor that smelled of damp wood, the clattering drawbridge that had led them deeper, past the painted knights whose grins looked sharper under the flicker of black-light. Beyond that, memory frayed into shadows and screams and the thunder of their own footsteps as they fled.
 Daniel glanced around the table and wondered if the others felt it too—that the years had not dulled the place but only blurred the edges, as if the funhouse waited intact somewhere beyond the rain, its corridors patient, its doors still closed on secrets the living had never pried open.
Outside, thunder rolled across the dark fields, and the town’s single neon sign flickered like a warning lantern left too long untended.

1nujvy1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nujvy1,Update: Moccamaster Chemex mod,"TL;DR: Technivorm’s water arm still sucks, swirling is mandatory, aluminum discs > wooden plate, and BWT Mg2+ was a game-changer.

Just to add an update: my main concern is still the water arm — I honestly don’t get how Technivorm, after all these decades, hasn’t managed to move those holes at least a bit more toward the center. Asking for a circular distribution pattern might be another dimension altogether, but I don’t think it’s even that necessary.

The modified hotplate helps though: with a bigger flat surface, I can center the holes by moving the Chemex closer to the tank (plus it heats random teapots as well).

Anyway, after a few seconds you have to swirl the Chemex to homogenize the slurry (don’t stir). I’ll also try using a strainer with small holes (not mesh) as a distributor once it gets delivered. You still have to swirl the Chemex afterward to homogenize the yield.

The common trick with the original parts is to start the machine without the carafe, let the coffee bed saturate, stir it, then slide in the carafe and let the flow continue. That little tube in the lid is just for evening out the final yield, which I get — but for me, swirling is such a natural, automatic move with any filter brew that adding extra plastic feels unnecessary.

As a replacement for the wooden plate, I ordered some aluminum discs, stacked them to about 7 mm thickness (6 mm with 10 cm diameter to fill the depression + 1 mm with 12 cm to cover it), and it works perfectly. No complaints so far, I’m satisfied with the results.

(And yeah, I finally bought a BWT filter with Mg2+ — not sure why I waited so long.)",1,1759254262.0,Moccamaster,0,1.0,False

Since then, I’ve been keeping my total carbs low below 30 TOTAL g, in a large deficit of at least 1000cal based on my activity. Going to the gym like usual. And consuming plenty electrolytes. I use ketone strips and as of last night I made it to the dark pink.

For the longest time, I would open Adobe Illustrator and feel completely lost. The interface was overwhelming, there were too many tools, and I kept finding tutorials that promised a 'professional design in 10 minutes' but skipped over the crucial fundamentals!

After getting frustrated, I decided to learn it properly and created a full YouTube playlist **specifically for absolute beginners**, without assuming you know anything about the software.

**In this series, you'll learn:**

* How to understand the workspace simply (and which tools actually matter)
* How to use the Pen Tool without wanting to close the program immediately 😅
* The difference between Vector and Raster (and why Illustrator is important)
* How to design a simple logo from scratch
* How to use colors and fonts (Typography) correctly
* How to overcome the common problems every beginner faces

The playlist is **completely free**, and each video builds on the previous one.

1nujtjo,https://www.reddit.com/r/migraine/comments/1nujtjo/this_diet_is_working_how_i_went_from_daily/,This diet is working: How I went from daily triptans to zero migraines so far,"I'm on my fourth day. No medication needed. Nothing. No migraines at all. From daily once or twice a day triptans, terrible migraines, nothing working, horrible...I've had these my whole life since I was 4...and they were getting WAY WORSE over the past year...

...until...

Bliss.

I'll tell you my story, and then give you a warning.

What am I doing? 

Diet. It increases Fibroblast Growth Factor 21, FGF21. I eat nothing but sugary things until late afternoon, then fast a few hours, then have a normal dinner.

High sugar and ultra low protein raises FGF21 dramatically and this increases metabolic rate. 

My body temps are really solid, 37C or a bit higher (98.6 - 99F) most of the day. Up from 35.8 or 36 even taking T3/T4 thyroid.

And my sleep has been AMAZING. I've been sleeping so well since I started this. 

So how is FGF21 raised?

FGF21 is raised when you consume empty calories, especially sugar, without protein.

But: It isn't as simple as ""raise your FGF21 and migraines go away."" Because migraineurs may have HIGHER FGF21. So do obese or fat people.

It's not the levels of FGF21, it's the sensitivity to FGF21 that counts.

We can become resistant to FGF21, like insulin resistance, when levels remain elevated but it doesn't have the effects that are positive anymore. Fat people and obese people may have chronically elevated FGF21 and they won't respond to this diet the way I do.

But I'm not diabetic, I'm healthy, and I can tell FGF21 is elevated because my body temps are much higher now, due to the effect of FGF21 on increasing metabolic rate.

And for me, it has meant so far:

No migraine, no headache. I feel great. I'm functioning at a high level.

How is that even possible??? Mitochondria work better. Insulin sensitivity rises. Maybe CGRP falls although I don't know of any studies on that. 

What I'm doing:

Three phases.

First phase, honey and sweets all day.

Second phase, fast for a few hours.

Third phase, eat a normal dinner. Protein, fat, starch. 

The core of the first phase is...

Honey, lots of honey. Fruit and fruit juice. Sugary soda is okay. Coffee loaded with honey. Dates. Mangoes. No starch, no fat, no protein until dinner. 

Fruit has protein in it, so best to drink some very low protein juice and a bit of fruit but not depend on oodles of fruit.

Then a few hours of no food, then dinner. 

That's all there is to it.

It began to work immediately.

I did feel flu like symptoms for a few days, feeling better today but I think that is normal for a new diet.

I'm still taking B1 and B3, and magnesium.

And if you think this is bad for you, it may be. I can't say. You should discuss with your health professional. It may be very bad for you.

But I think there are positives for many folks. It resembles diets called Fasting Mimicking Diets, FMDs, that are shown to have very positive results in animal models and in humans. 

FMDs can lower inflammatory markers. They can raise sensitivity to glucose. They can increase lifespan. And, my diet, the Honey Diet, spares lean mass because that sugar helps prevent loss of muscle mass during the no protein periods of each day.

It is possible that certain proteins, such as gelatin, could be okay because they are low in BCAAs and isoleucine, but that remains to be seen. I'm just pursuing the 3 phase Honey Diet as indicated above, and will experiment further in a few months.

If I was not responding to this diet, I would talk to my doctor and go on a carb and fat fast, and just eat nothing but lean meat and eggs for a week or two. 

By high protein and low carbs and low fat, FGF21 lowers and sensitivity to it may be restored. Purely speculative on my part.

if this interests you TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR FIRST. It could be very harmful to some people. 

But all I can say is, I'm glad I'm on this. It's AWESOME to wake up with NO HEADACHE whatsoever and not have any all day, every day. Wow. 

  
Note: Everything is multi factorial. I'm also doing intermittent hypoxia therapy. I've been doing that for 6 weeks and it had no effect on my migraines. Just want to include that.

Three deaths.

One after the other, each separated by exactly one week’s time, and the circumstances were bafflingly similar. Nearly identical, actually.

Each victim lived alone.

Each victim died in the same manner.

And each victim left the same note.

One thing was certain: the deaths were not natural. That left foul play or suicide, but, according to Detective Ambrose, neither explanation really made much sense. That didn’t stop people from developing an opinion, though.

The conundrum left the department precariously split: half the bullpen thought murder, the other half thought suicide. Tensions were mounting. The hung jury was getting restless. Historically even-keeled officers were instigating screaming matches over the topic. They needed a tiebreaker: information that could put the mystery to bed. For the victims, sure, but also for the department’s sanity.

That’s where I came in, he said.

The detective paused.

*“Come on in and sit down whenever the mood suits you, I suppose,”* he grumbled.

I guess it was wishful thinking to believe he’d let me listen to the entire briefing from the safety of the doorway.

From where I stood, his office looked like a war zone.

Stacks of overstuffed boxes rose high against every available inch of wall, jaundice-colored documents leaking from soggy cracks and bulging lids. A lone bulb, dangling from exposed wires that snaked up into the ceiling, cast the room in a meager glow. There *technically* was an available chair - a rickety, dangerous-looking thing, its cracked seat sloping leftward because of its uneven, rust-covered legs - but I’d have to move carefully through the dimly lit space to reach it.

*“Yeah, of course,”* I replied. Reluctantly, I tiptoed inside.

A faint fungal aroma lingered in the air, stale and tangy, like a cup of stagnant orange juice bristling with hungry mold. Stray documents lurked on the floor, some visible, others concealed within a thin layer of darkness where the light couldn’t reach. Slipped more than once, but thankfully, I did not fall. After a minute of tedious navigation, I planted myself down wordlessly, cautious not to clip the empty coffee cups lining the edge of his desk with my bag.

*“Sorry about the mess - my actual office is currently being renovated.”*

I nodded and shot him a weak, sympathetic smile, though I couldn’t help but wonder if this particular civil servant was on a red-eye flight to the unemployment line.

Felt like I’d met every agent in my decades of freelance work, but I hadn’t met Ambrose. Judging from the state of his “office” - the downright cataclysmic levels of disarray - there may have been a good reason for that. The man was no spring chicken, either. Wrinkles, liver spots, and a pair of cataract-stricken eyes combined to form something akin to a face below a mop of frizzy white hair.

Not that I was really in a position to criticize. My apartment was just as bad, if not worse, and I’d recently found myself on the wrong side of my late forties.

I eased into that deathtrap of a chair. For a moment, he just stared at me, elbows resting on the desk, hands clasped. The bulb flickered. He disappeared and then reappeared from the resulting blackness, but he did not move, nor did he blink.

*“…so, you'd like me to weigh in on the notes?”* I asked.

*“Ah, yes!”* he squealed. Ambrose visibly winced at his own reaction. His cheeks became flushed. He coughed vigorously, as if clearing phlegm, which only reddened his cheeks further.

*“Yes, yes...the notes...”* he reiterated in a deeper voice.

The detective tore three sheets from a nearby file.

*“Here’s the rub, Vivian: as far as we can tell, these victims never interacted with each other; not in any meaningful way, and yet, they all left one of these behind in their wake.”*

He handed me three black-and-white photographs, each centered on three differently shaped scraps of paper, each featuring the same five words:

***“Thread’s loose. Be back soon.”***

And just like that, in spite of his strangeness, he had my undivided attention. Wild curiosity coiled around my heart: a python twisting about weakened prey, almost ready to squeeze.

*“Now, if you buy the bullshit theory that these three killed themselves, I guess you could call them ‘suicide notes,’”* the detective continued, revealing his take on the “murder vs. suicide” controversy.

As he spoke, I fanned the pictures out. Compared them side-by-side.

*“I don’t call them suicide notes, though, ‘cause they don’t read like dying words to me; more like a strange calling card, the pretentious droppings of some knock-off, store-brand Zodiac Killer, getting a hard-on imagining us scratching our heads over their grand cipher.”*

The letters had…embellishments. Ornamentations. Flourishes as artistic as they were enigmatic.

In my twenty years of forensic document examination, I hadn’t ever seen anything like it.

There was a crescentic curl spinning clockwise off the bottom of the “T”. The “d” harbored three crisp, horizontal dots within its confines. The capital “B” had an extra bowl stacked on top of the normal two, looking like a pair of brass knuckles modified to fit a three-fingered mafioso. Each note’s handwriting was distinct, yes, but the flourishes? They appeared eerily identical.

*“No signs of forced entry at any of the crime scenes, no fingerprints on the murder weapons, and the handwriting seems to match each victim, at least to our untrained eyes.”*

He yanked the photos away and slid them into a manila folder. I struggled against the impulse to pull them back.

*“So - you’ll need to tell us if the notes are forgeries. If they are, that suggests one person wrote all three, which suggests murder. If they aren’t, I suppose they must have been suicides.”*

An impish smirk slithered across his face.

*“Can’t be both, right?”*

*“Not in my experience, no,”* I replied bluntly, a little exhausted by the man’s loopy behavior.

After a few more minutes of talking shop, the briefing concluded. I stood up and reached across the desk, offering the detective my hand. He did not shake it. No, the man just examined it.

Ambrose looked it over closely, like I was handing him a kitchen knife blade first and he was unsure of a safe place to grasp it. Eventually, I allowed my palm a tactical retreat, shoving the spurned digits into my pants pocket and turning to stumble my way out of the office.

Before officially departing, I realized I was missing some crucial information.

*“Remind me - how did they die?”* I asked from the doorway.

He closed his eyes, leaned back, and scratched his chin.

*“I think that’s out of your scope, Vivian,”* he muttered.

My pulse quickened. I felt the hard, gritty friction of grinding teeth and the boiling unease of growing rage.

*“Sir - Detective Ambrose - with all due respect, I’ve worked hand-in-hand with your department for decades. It hasn’t always been a perfectly amicable relationship, but not once has a detective outright refused to give me pertinent information.”*

***“That’s out of your scope, Vivian.*****”** He repeated himself, but much louder, over-enunciating each syllable, giving the statement an almost concussive quality - a series of rapid punches aimed at my torso. Despite the shouting, that impish smirk never left his face. He bellowed straight through the smile like it wasn’t even there.

The outburst left me slack-jawed. My head swiveled, peering down the hall, looking for someone to act as an impromptu referee for this bizarre interaction, to no avail. Ambrose’s office was in the station’s sublevel. Foot traffic was minimal.

When I looked back, he was *waving* at me. A stiff and exaggerated *bon voyage* that frightened me more than the shouting. It feels absurd to label the man an amateur at waving, but it truly looked like he was reenacting something he’d seen in a commercial once, rather than a normal, human gesture.

*“Thanks! This was fun. Bye now. My cell number should be in the file; let me know if you need anything!”* he boomed, visage strobing from the bulb flickering on and off.

My blood cooled. My rage wilted. I jogged off without responding, manila folder of documents tightly in hand. Knowing I had some work to sink my teeth into when I got home was the sole saving grace of the whole damn ordeal.

I paced towards the elevator. My eyes kept darting over my shoulder, half expecting to catch Ambrose in hot pursuit. He never was. Instead, I saw an elderly woman with thick bottle-cap glasses and a warm grin exiting one of the other offices. She implored me to hold the elevator as she shuffled rigidly across the sublevel’s tile flooring, so I stuck my hand over the sensor. The woman entered, thanked me, and we were finally on our way.

As I flung my car door shut, I wanted nothing more than to brush it off. Unfortunately, mental rumination is my god given talent. If dwelling were a sport, I’d be an Olympian. If perseveration could be monetized, I would have retired in the 80s a billionaire.

I couldn’t help myself.

For what felt like the fortieth time, I replayed his robotic, almost child-like wave in my head, trying - and failing - to discern *why* any self-respecting adult man would do such a thing. As the replays crested into the triple digits, a nagging detail started bubbling to the surface.

I saw something on his palm as he waved me off. Faded mounds of puckered skin organized into a very specific shape: a scar. The type of scar you don’t acquire by accident.

An equilateral triangle, point down, with two diagonal lines continuing beyond the point. Where one of them stopped, the other kinked at a ninety-degree angle and kept going, but only for a little longer. It resembled an hourglass with the bottom falling out like a trapdoor, or an “X” with the top covered and a small tail.

As I peeled down the interstate, speed steadily increasing, I couldn’t get the symbol out of my mind.

Did I imagine the detail?

Was it just a weird trick of the light, shadows dancing across his palm in such a way that it gave the impression of something that wasn’t actually there?

If the scar *was* real, then what the hell did it mean?

My attention drifted from the vacant highway to a passing billboard for only a fraction of a second. When my attention shifted back, I felt my heart detonate against the back of my throat.

There was a rapidly approaching bumper. I slammed on the brakes. The sharp chemical odor of burning rubber invaded my nostrils. I braced for impact.

My sedan thudded to a painful, suspension-destroying stop at what felt like the last possible second. The very tip of my car clinked gingerly against their license plate. Don’t think the driver even looked up from their phone.

The war drum beating in my chest slowed, and slowed, and slowed, and then I finally let myself breathe.

Gridlock was unusual for the early afternoon, but I had a sneaking suspicion as to the reason behind it. I grabbed a half-empty pack of Newports from the cupholder, stuck a cigarette between my still-trembling lips, and rolled down the window. Damp summer air coated my exposed skin. I felt my forearm stick to the hot plastic as I pulled my head out to get a better view of the holdup.

There was a plume of smoke in the distance, maybe a quarter mile ahead of the traffic. No nearby construction signage, either. As I lowered myself back into the car, my mouth was dry and my mind was racing. They’d been happening more and more recently. If I saw two on the way to the grocery store, and three on my way home, that’d be under the average. A good day, all things considered.

In the past year, the number of car accidents that occurred across my fair city had skyrocketed.

Most were mild. Fender-benders. Distracted drivers who poorly estimated how fast a car was going, or how far away they were. Some were more serious. A small proportion resulted in fatalities, and, if the press was to be believed, an even smaller proportion of the collisions were both tragically fatal *and* alarmingly inexplicable.

Inexplicable how? Well, it was tough to say. Local journalists waltzed elegantly around the details, hinting at *some* unexplainable aspect of the wrecks while diligently reporting the carnage.

I remember the title of one article read:

*“In a crash that has police puzzled, totaled SUV discovered around small bus. 15 killed. Only surviving victim remains comatose and unable to provide further details.”*

I’m sorry - the SUV was *around* the bus? How exactly would that work?

Mechanistically, what possible circumstances could have led to that outcome?

The article itself focused exclusively on memorializing the victims, which, although admirable, left us layfolk more than a little confused.

Pictures of the dead before the crash? Yes.

Pictures of the crash itself? Conspicuously absent.

Many DUI checkpoints and anti-texting-while-driving initiatives later, nothing much had changed. The crashes were only becoming more frequent as time went on.

Suffice it to say, I experienced a gnawing dread about what might lie beneath the plume of smoke.

Speaking of smoke, the cancer stick did wonders massaging my frayed nerves into a state of tenuous relaxation. I inched through the traffic without succumbing to a panic attack. Half an hour later, I was scooting by the crash itself, though I had a hard time comprehending what I was looking at.

I lit another cigarette.

There was just a heap of tangled metal. A ball of harsh silvery edges shimmering in the midday sun, seemingly closer to what would come out of a car blender than a collision on the interstate.

Where did the first vehicle start and the other vehicle end?

Were there more than two in that unintelligible mess?

And, most chillingly, what chance did *anyone* have to survive such a crash?

My eyes traced various lines of coherent metal as they dipped in and out of the shattered steel nucleus, figuring that if I could wrap my head around its interlocking knots and snarls, then I could mentally wring it all out. Unravel the crash like a length of twisted yarn until, inevitably, I was left with the cars that created it, each full and perfect. From there, I’d finally understand how it happened.

I thought if I could understand it, then I’d be safe.

The sound of a blaring horn behind me ruptured my trance. Unconsciously, I had come to a complete stop at the crux of the bottleneck. I pressed my foot on the gas and sped forward, trying to focus on the drive home, trying to stay in the moment, trying not to ruminate on something I didn’t understand for once in my life and just move on.

Surprisingly, I was successful; I didn’t dwell on the crash, but only because another incomprehensible image seemed more pressing.

An “X” covered at the top with a small tail.

An hourglass with an open trapdoor at the bottom.

One that I felt myself falling through, dropping deeper with each passing second.

\- - - - -

The stench pummeled my body like an avalanche.

My apartment never smelled good - not in the years I’d lived there - but that evening, the odor was uniquely abrasive. Sulfurous, sour, and sweet. A scent that landed somewhere between spoiled tofu and an oozing septic tank.

I slammed the door shut and threw my bag onto the kitchen island. Plastic sushi trays containing petrified ores of unused wasabi clattered to the floor, making room. I held my breath, surveying the kitchen, assessing for the source. There was a bevy of potential culprits: the partially eaten microwave dinners covering the countertops, whatever prehistoric takeout skulked in the darkest corners of my fridge, the once verdant spider plant that was beginning to show signs of rot, et cetera, et cetera.

Ultimately, I’d need to breathe deep if I wanted to locate the proverbial needle in the haystack.

I didn’t have to search very hard. With willing nostrils, the putrid odor promptly escorted me to a small crevice between my workbench and the nearby wall, where a discarded box of half-eaten lo mien laid in wait, hidden for God knows how long. I delivered the biohazard to my building’s trash chute immediately, holding it by the tip of a sodden white fold like it was the tail of a long-dead rat.

Crisis averted.

When I returned, the apartment still smelled, but it was its familiar, baseline reek, and I found that to be acceptable.

I wasn’t always so grubby.

As a kid, my bedroom sparkled. I could manage the responsibility because my internal fixations were incredibly narrow, practically pinpointed. If I kept my room immaculate and got perfect grades, I was good, I was safe.

Age, to my chagrin, introduced an infinite-feeling rogues’ gallery of additional topics to helplessly fixate on: romance, politics, existential terror, climate change, mortality, morality, drugs, STDs, taxes, real estate, sex, desire, prestige, heart attacks, dementia, on, and on, and on, like gas expanding against the seams of my skull, threatening to break it wide open, splattering my precious neural jelly all over my socially adjusted peers, staining their nice, white clothes a visceral red-blue.

My twenties were rough.

For a while, I simply existed. Not alive. Not dead. Paralyzed through and through.

The pursuit of inner peace led me to group meditation, but I couldn’t just sit; I needed something that cleared my mind but kept my body moving. A friend recommended calligraphy. I tried it, and for the first time in my life, I tasted harmony. I found something I could get lost in, something that released the pressure in my skull.

From there, I made the mysterious beauty of written language a career.

With the stench tackled, I settled at my workbench. The space was tidy. The oak gleamed. The overhead lights had freshly replaced bulbs, and the lens of my standing magnifying glass was clear and dustless.

I opened the manila folder, flicked the lights on, spread the documents across the oak, and lost myself.

But only for a little while.

***“Thread’s Loose. Be back soon.”***

I figured I’d tackle the notes one by one, comparing their handwriting to older samples provided by Detective Ambrose. Before I could start, however, something caught my eye. A subtle discrepancy between the notes that I hadn’t detected on a cursory examination.

The strange, captivating embellishments weren’t *completely* identical, as I first thought. One flourish differed.

There was a small dash coming off the last letter, the “n”. That was true for each note. However, the dashes weren’t all going in the same direction.

One moved up at an angle, one was straight, and one went down at an angle.

Suddenly, the writing felt magnetic. I couldn’t peel myself away. My eyes refused to blink, galvanized to the lettering. My attention made a cyclic pilgrimage from one note to the next, studying the variation with reverence and awe.

Up, across, down.

I started hearing something I didn’t recognize. A noise that didn’t belong in my apartment. A noise that didn’t belong *anywhere*.

Up, across, down.

A quiet, lawless tapping. A thousand fingernails clicking against marble - manic, hungry, forlorn.

Up, across, down.

The anarchic noise got louder. A riot filled my ears, no room for anything else. The sound was like a chest-high wave of centipedes was advancing towards me, tethered hides futilely knocking into each other as they desperately tried to untangle themselves, tapping, tapping, tapping.

Up, across, down.

The embellishments developed depth.

The photograph cracked and splintered like expanding ice.

The letters unzipped.

If squinted, if I positioned my head *just* right, I could spy something between the cracks.

The hideous tapping reached a fever pitch.

Then, there was knocking at my door.

*“Viv! Viv, you home?”* a muffled voice asked.

I leapt back, my chair clattering behind me, my heartbeat thumping and rabid.

When I looked to the door, the tapping faded.

*“Jesus, Viv, you okay in there?”*

Wobbling, blurry vision wading through tides of vertigo, I moved to open the door. The deadbolt clicked and I cracked the door, just enough to show that I was indeed alive. Maggie had an itchy trigger finger when it came to phoning emergency services.

She was an empathetic friend and an accommodating next-door neighbor, but the sixty-something ex-beatnik was also a hell of a snoop. Wasn’t uncommon to see her striding up and down our floor, ears perked, patrolling for even the faintest wisps of gossip. Retirement had left her with nothing better to do. So even though her expression betrayed concern, there was an undeniable glint of curiosity swelling behind her eyes.

I ran a quivering hand through my hair, pulling strands slick with sweat from my face.

*“Yeah, Mags, I’m good, just working,”* I muttered.

Maggie shot me a sideways glance, penciled brows arched.

*“Right.”* she replied flatly. I shrugged, fighting the urge to push the door closed.

Her features softened, curiosity snuffed out, a parish of worry lines congregating along her forehead.

*“Sweetheart, I know you’re a bloodhound with your work - God bless and keep you - but I don’t think you know when to stop.”* She lifted a bottle of cheap, nutmeg-colored whiskey into view. *“Moreover, I have news about Mr. Peterson, and it’s ghastly, absolutely fucking harrowing. Care for a break?”*

I shifted nervously in the doorway, still rattled from what I’d just experienced, but wanting nothing more than to return to my workbench at the same time.

*“Sorry - I didn’t mean to phrase that like a question, because it ain’t. Get on out here, Viv.”*

A delicate smile crept across my face. I relented.

*“Ugh, fine. I’ll meet you on the roof in five. Gotta clean up in here.”*

Maggie sniffed cartoonishly, well aware of the man-made disaster that was my apartment.

*“You’ll be able to do that in five minutes?”*

My smile bloomed.

*“Nice one, Mags, real clever.”*

I shut the door.

To relax, I needed to tidy my workbench first. Figured I’d collect the documents into a neat pile, pull the chair upright, and then I’d be ready; I could attend to the notes at another time. There was no rush, and I was clearly a little out of sorts.

I almost convinced myself that what I experienced was just the hallucinogenic vacillations of an overburdened mind. A sort of cognitive spasm that was downstream of the detective’s unsettling behavior, the horrific collision, or low blood sugar - most likely some ungodly combination of all three.

But then I scanned the room.

I blinked.

I blinked again.

When that didn’t remedy the problem, I rubbed my eyes so strenuously that my vision temporarily blurred. Nothing changed.

My rolling chair was just…gone.

Wasn’t tipped over on my stain-riddled carpet, like it should’ve been.

I checked my bedroom: no chair.

I checked my bathroom: no chair.

I checked my single, multi-purpose closet: unless it’d somehow become buried deep within the mountain of microwave dinner boxes and old clothes, it wasn’t there either.

For a brief moment, my gaze flirted with the photographs still lurking atop my workbench. A gentle flurry of distant taps resonated against my eardrums, beckoning me.

I ripped myself away. Forced my eyes closed.

The sound promptly dissipated.

Pacing out of my apartment, I locked the door behind me and headed up to the roof, leaving my workbench cluttered for the first and last time.

\- - - - -

The roof was our sanctuary, our private serenity sequestered fifteen stories above the maddening bustle of the city. We’d made weekly visits to that place for as long as we’d been friends: eight and a half years, give or take. Pretty sure the landlord didn’t know about our trips, either.

Maggie was strangely proficient with a lock pick.

From the relative comfort of her two raggedy beach chairs, we watched the sun curve through the atmosphere, drenching the sky in its liquid gold. The bottom-shelf whiskey laminated my throat with the pleasant burn of a campfire. Intoxication coaxed out an edited recollection of my day, and it felt damn good. I smoothed out the stranger details, of course. She didn’t need to know about the unusual symbol or the frenetic tapping, but I did mention the vanishing chair.

*“I’m sure you’ll find it.""* Maggie reassured me. ""*You know, something like that happened to me recently. Something outlandish.”*

She passed the bottle, and I took another generous swig.

*“Tell me.”* I rasped, the taste of turpentine still crackling over my tongue.

*“Well…”*

Maggie paused; an uncharacteristic lapse in momentum. She was never one to mince words. The chair screeched against the rough concrete as she turned it to face me. Her frost-tinted eyes locked onto mine.

*“So, I was cutting a pizza the other day,”* she started.

*“As one does.”* I slurred.

*“Hush, child. Listen.”*

I placed the bottle on the concrete, sat up straight, and saluted her.

*“Yes, ma’am. Right away, ma’am.”*

She rolled her eyes.

*“Anyway, I’m cutting a pizza, and I make two cuts. To be clear, I’m sure I made two cuts: one vertical, one left to right. Separated it into four equal slices, same way I always do.”*

I nodded, curious about the anecdote’s punchline.

*“But, when I looked…”* she trailed off. Another pause. Maggie grabbed the bottle by the neck, and imbibed. One, two, three gulps for courage. Then she started again.

*“When I looked, there were only three pieces.”*

A sputtering chuckle erupted from my lips.

*“What? Mags, what the hell are you talking about? What do you mean, ‘there were only three pieces’?”*

Her face began to flush, and she looked away. Instant regret soured some of the whiskey sloshing around my gut.

She furiously gesticulated cutting a pizza in the air and repeated herself.

*“I put two equal cuts into the pizza, in the shape of a plus, like I’ve been doing since the day I was old enough to work an oven, and, somehow, I was left with three slices. How the fuck does that happen? Doesn’t make a lick of sense.”*

Her words came out sharp, as if it was painful to say any of it out loud. I reached over and rubbed her shoulder.

*“Hey - no worse than losing a chair. I think we’re both getting senile, you old bat. Like, you haven’t even told me the ‘ghastly’ news about Mr. Peterson, and that’s the gossip you led with…”*

Maggie sprang from her beach chair.

*“Oh my fucking god! Yes! I can’t believe I forgot. I mean, I’m glad I forgot for a little; shit was ghastly. Ain’t really gossip, either.”*

She began pacing in small, hectic circles.

*“So, I was doing my rounds - wandering from boredom - and I reached Mr. Peterson’s room, all the way on the opposite end of the hall. I rarely go that far, suppose I was particularly stir-crazy yesterday. You know him, right?”*

I nodded. He was a crotchety old man who owned the nearby laundromat. I’d suffered plenty of awkward elevator rides with him over the years. Small talk with the curmudgeon was basically impossible. Far as I could tell, we had only two things in common: we were both unmarried, and we both rented apartments at the very edge of our exceptionally wide complex.

*“I got to his door, and there was…a smell. A terrible, rotting smell, like roadkill. And…I don’t know, I feared the worst, so I knocked. No response, but the door creaked open a smidge. Needless to say, I was the person who found him. By the looks of it, he’d been dead a while.”*

*“Oh, Jesus…”* I whispered.

*“Viv - trust me, it gets much, much worse.”*

My pulse quickened.

*“He…he was naked, sprawled out on the floor. No head. No arms - well, no attached arms. Half his right leg removed at the knee.”*

She sighed, interrupted her frantic pacing, and peered up at the sky, as if she were beseeching God for a reasonable explanation to what she had witnessed.

*“His arms were folded over his chest, laid parallel to his shoulders so that his neck stump and his jagged arm knubs were all clustered together, elbows bent so his hands were covering his belly button. And…and his left leg - the one that was still sort of intact - they twisted it counterclockwise until the kneecap pointed away from the body. Bent that leg too, just like the arms: same forty-five degree angle. Oh! And they fuckin’ painted them, too, just the arms and the legs. Bright, bleedin’ red, all the way around. Made what was left of him look like some weird, fucked hieroglyphic.”*

Breath fled my lungs. My brain sizzled, cooking itself delirious.

A vision of the detective’s scar took form in my consciousness.

And I thought I could hear the tapping.

But it could’ve just been a memory.

I choked out seven small words: *“The shape…kind of…like an hourglass?”*

Maggie thought about it for a second. She seemed to register my simmering panic.

*“Uh…well, yeah, sort of.”*

*“And you’re sure he wasn’t newly dead?”*

*“Yes, Viv - I’m sure. Don’t plan on cursing you with those grisly details, but he’d clearly been dead a while. The officer I spoke with thought just as much when they came to pick him - his body - up.”*

My stomach lurched. I felt it vibrating like a harshly plucked string, fluttering violently against my abdominal muscles.

*“Was there…was there a note?”*

She forced a weak laugh.

*“What, like some last words? From Mr. Peterson, or his killer? Love, I have no fucking idea, and I didn’t walk in to find out - last I checked, I’m not a CSI.”*

I rocketed from my beach chair, knocking over the whiskey bottle in my turbulent haste.

*“Vivian, sweetheart - please, tell me what’s happening…”* she pleaded.

Without another word, I sprinted away, hyperventilating, tripping over my own feet.

Maggie called out after me, but I didn’t look back.

I tried to call Ambrose at the number he’d provided. When he didn’t pick up, I ordered an Uber.

If luck was on my side, the department would still be open.

\- - - - -

The elevator chimed. The doors crept apart to reveal the sublevel. I lumbered down the musty hallway.

Desperate rationalizations sprouted from my ailing psyche, more and more every second.

*Ambrose misspoke. Got the dates mixed up or something.*

*Maybe I misheard him. I could have misheard him.*

*Maggie was mistaken - Mr. Peterson had to have died yesterday.*

But the police just *learned* of him yesterday. Maggie’s no idiot, either. Doubt she’d confuse new death for prolonged decomposition. And nothing could explain the state of the body matching the scar on Ambrose’s palm.

I stumbled. The walls seemed to shudder as my body made contact. I stifled a shriek and pushed myself off the shivering plaster.

Had to keep moving, had to keep going.

The light in his cramped office was still on, still flickering, but Ambrose wasn't there.

Just then, the woman I’d held the elevator door for a few hours earlier stepped out of her office. I jogged up to her as she fumbled with a keyring.

*“Excuse me, excuse me -”* to my embarrassment, the words came out liquor-soaked: garbled, slow, and soft.

She twitched, startled, dropping her keys to the floor. The woman placed a trembling hand to her chest and turned to face me.

*“Heavens. Don’t you have better places to be, young lady?”*

I bent down, picked up her keys, and handed them over.

*“Sorry. The detective who works down the hall, have you seen him? Is he still here?”*

She cocked her head.

*“Ambrose?”* I clarified.

The woman shrugged. Her lips tightened into a narrow line. She returned to locking her office, the key finally clicking into place. When she pivoted back to me, her expression was scornful, irritated, but her indignation seemed to melt away upon getting a good look at my sorry state - body drunk, mind breaking.

*“Honey…is there someone I can call for you? Are you lost? Do you need help?”* she purred.

*“What? No. No, I had a meeting with a detective, last door on the left, a little after eleven this morning, and I need” -* abruptly, I belched - “*I need to speak with him right away.”*

When she still appeared hopelessly confused, I turned and pointed to his office.

Her eyes darted from the room, to me, and then to her feet. She sighed, exasperated, and then began digging through her purse.

*“Where is the detective who works in* ***that goddamn*** *office?”* I asked, tone much angrier than I intended.

The woman retrieved her cell phone, dialed, and placed it against her ear.

*“I don’t know how you keep getting in here, but I’m calling you an ambulance.”*

I considered grabbing my lanyard and waving my ID in front of her face. Before I could, however, she said something that crushed me completely.

*“Because, honey, that room is a* [*storage closet.”*](https://www.reddit.com/r/unalloyedsainttrina/comments/1j88zl3/welcome_to_a_very_chaotic_horror_subredditupdated/)",2,1759254004.0,TheCrypticCompendium,0,1.0,False

My husband and I have been ttc for 2.5 years. A close friend found out she was pregnant about a year ago. I was there when she found out, baby shower and even delivery room. It was super hard but I felt it was important to show up. I even would put her OB appointments in my phone to ensure I checked up on her afterward to see how they went. 

Fast forward to now. Her baby is 3 months old and my husband and I are in the trenches of IVF. She has not checked in on me at all in the last couple months. We went for coffee a couple weeks ago and she didn’t ask how I c was going once. I’ve now started stims and she hasn’t reached out to check in. 

I called her last week to tell her that I thought there was some distance and I wanted to make sure  I didn’t do anything. 

She said I didn’t do anything. She is just trying to prioritize her family and church over friends. Today I see that she is in Florida with another friend. I can’t help but feel used and discarded.

- - - - -

Three deaths.

One after the other, each separated by exactly one week’s time, and the circumstances were bafflingly similar. Nearly identical, actually.

Each victim lived alone.

Each victim died in the same manner.

And each victim left the same note.

One thing was certain: the deaths were not natural. That left foul play or suicide, but, according to Detective Ambrose, neither explanation really made much sense. That didn’t stop people from developing an opinion, though.

The conundrum left the department precariously split: half the bullpen thought murder, the other half thought suicide. Tensions were mounting. The hung jury was getting restless. Historically even-keeled officers were instigating screaming matches over the topic. They needed a tiebreaker: information that could put the mystery to bed. For the victims, sure, but also for the department’s sanity.

That’s where I came in, he said.

The detective paused.

*“Come on in and sit down whenever the mood suits you, I suppose,”* he grumbled.

I guess it was wishful thinking to believe he’d let me listen to the entire briefing from the safety of the doorway.

From where I stood, his office looked like a war zone.

Stacks of overstuffed boxes rose high against every available inch of wall, jaundice-colored documents leaking from soggy cracks and bulging lids. A lone bulb, dangling from exposed wires that snaked up into the ceiling, cast the room in a meager glow. There *technically* was an available chair - a rickety, dangerous-looking thing, its cracked seat sloping leftward because of its uneven, rust-covered legs - but I’d have to move carefully through the dimly lit space to reach it.

*“Yeah, of course,”* I replied. Reluctantly, I tiptoed inside.

A faint fungal aroma lingered in the air, stale and tangy, like a cup of stagnant orange juice bristling with hungry mold. Stray documents lurked on the floor, some visible, others concealed within a thin layer of darkness where the light couldn’t reach. Slipped more than once, but thankfully, I did not fall. After a minute of tedious navigation, I planted myself down wordlessly, cautious not to clip the empty coffee cups lining the edge of his desk with my bag.

*“Sorry about the mess - my actual office is currently being renovated.”*

I nodded and shot him a weak, sympathetic smile, though I couldn’t help but wonder if this particular civil servant was on a red-eye flight to the unemployment line.

Felt like I’d met every agent in my decades of freelance work, but I hadn’t met Ambrose. Judging from the state of his “office” - the downright cataclysmic levels of disarray - there may have been a good reason for that. The man was no spring chicken, either. Wrinkles, liver spots, and a pair of cataract-stricken eyes combined to form something akin to a face below a mop of frizzy white hair.

Not that I was really in a position to criticize. My apartment was just as bad, if not worse, and I’d recently found myself on the wrong side of my late forties.

I eased into that deathtrap of a chair. For a moment, he just stared at me, elbows resting on the desk, hands clasped. The bulb flickered. He disappeared and then reappeared from the resulting blackness, but he did not move, nor did he blink.

*“…so, you'd like me to weigh in on the notes?”* I asked.

*“Ah, yes!”* he squealed. Ambrose visibly winced at his own reaction. His cheeks became flushed. He coughed vigorously, as if clearing phlegm, which only reddened his cheeks further.

*“Yes, yes...the notes...”* he reiterated in a deeper voice.

The detective tore three sheets from a nearby file.

*“Here’s the rub, Vivian: as far as we can tell, these victims never interacted with each other; not in any meaningful way, and yet, they all left one of these behind in their wake.”*

He handed me three black-and-white photographs, each centered on three differently shaped scraps of paper, each featuring the same five words:

***“Thread’s loose. Be back soon.”***

And just like that, in spite of his strangeness, he had my undivided attention. Wild curiosity coiled around my heart: a python twisting about weakened prey, almost ready to squeeze.

*“Now, if you buy the bullshit theory that these three killed themselves, I guess you could call them ‘suicide notes,’”* the detective continued, revealing his take on the “murder vs. suicide” controversy.

As he spoke, I fanned the pictures out. Compared them side-by-side.

*“I don’t call them suicide notes, though, ‘cause they don’t read like dying words to me; more like a strange calling card, the pretentious droppings of some knock-off, store-brand Zodiac Killer, getting a hard-on imagining us scratching our heads over their grand cipher.”*

The letters had…embellishments. Ornamentations. Flourishes as artistic as they were enigmatic.

In my twenty years of forensic document examination, I hadn’t ever seen anything like it.

There was a crescentic curl spinning clockwise off the bottom of the “T”. The “d” harbored three crisp, horizontal dots within its confines. The capital “B” had an extra bowl stacked on top of the normal two, looking like a pair of brass knuckles modified to fit a three-fingered mafioso. Each note’s handwriting was distinct, yes, but the flourishes? They appeared eerily identical.

*“No signs of forced entry at any of the crime scenes, no fingerprints on the murder weapons, and the handwriting seems to match each victim, at least to our untrained eyes.”*

He yanked the photos away and slid them into a manila folder. I struggled against the impulse to pull them back.

*“So - you’ll need to tell us if the notes are forgeries. If they are, that suggests one person wrote all three, which suggests murder. If they aren’t, I suppose they must have been suicides.”*

An impish smirk slithered across his face.

*“Can’t be both, right?”*

*“Not in my experience, no,”* I replied bluntly, a little exhausted by the man’s loopy behavior.

After a few more minutes of talking shop, the briefing concluded. I stood up and reached across the desk, offering the detective my hand. He did not shake it. No, the man just examined it.

Ambrose looked it over closely, like I was handing him a kitchen knife blade first and he was unsure of a safe place to grasp it. Eventually, I allowed my palm a tactical retreat, shoving the spurned digits into my pants pocket and turning to stumble my way out of the office.

Before officially departing, I realized I was missing some crucial information.

*“Remind me - how did they die?”* I asked from the doorway.

He closed his eyes, leaned back, and scratched his chin.

*“I think that’s out of your scope, Vivian,”* he muttered.

My pulse quickened. I felt the hard, gritty friction of grinding teeth and the boiling unease of growing rage.

*“Sir - Detective Ambrose - with all due respect, I’ve worked hand-in-hand with your department for decades. It hasn’t always been a perfectly amicable relationship, but not once has a detective outright refused to give me pertinent information.”*

***“That’s out of your scope, Vivian.*****”** He repeated himself, but much louder, over-enunciating each syllable, giving the statement an almost concussive quality - a series of rapid punches aimed at my torso. Despite the shouting, that impish smirk never left his face. He bellowed straight through the smile like it wasn’t even there.

The outburst left me slack-jawed. My head swiveled, peering down the hall, looking for someone to act as an impromptu referee for this bizarre interaction, to no avail. Ambrose’s office was in the station’s sublevel. Foot traffic was minimal.

When I looked back, he was *waving* at me. A stiff and exaggerated *bon voyage* that frightened me more than the shouting. It feels absurd to label the man an amateur at waving, but it truly looked like he was reenacting something he’d seen in a commercial once, rather than a normal, human gesture.

*“Thanks! This was fun. Bye now. My cell number should be in the file; let me know if you need anything!”* he boomed, visage strobing from the bulb flickering on and off.

My blood cooled. My rage wilted. I jogged off without responding, manila folder of documents tightly in hand. Knowing I had some work to sink my teeth into when I got home was the sole saving grace of the whole damn ordeal.

I paced towards the elevator. My eyes kept darting over my shoulder, half expecting to catch Ambrose in hot pursuit. He never was. Instead, I saw an elderly woman with thick bottle-cap glasses and a warm grin exiting one of the other offices. She implored me to hold the elevator as she shuffled rigidly across the sublevel’s tile flooring, so I stuck my hand over the sensor. The woman entered, thanked me, and we were finally on our way.

As I flung my car door shut, I wanted nothing more than to brush it off. Unfortunately, mental rumination is my god given talent. If dwelling were a sport, I’d be an Olympian. If perseveration could be monetized, I would have retired in the 80s a billionaire.

I couldn’t help myself.

For what felt like the fortieth time, I replayed his robotic, almost child-like wave in my head, trying - and failing - to discern *why* any self-respecting adult man would do such a thing. As the replays crested into the triple digits, a nagging detail started bubbling to the surface.

I saw something on his palm as he waved me off. Faded mounds of puckered skin organized into a very specific shape: a scar. The type of scar you don’t acquire by accident.

An equilateral triangle, point down, with two diagonal lines continuing beyond the point. Where one of them stopped, the other kinked at a ninety-degree angle and kept going, but only for a little longer. It resembled an hourglass with the bottom falling out like a trapdoor, or an “X” with the top covered and a small tail.

As I peeled down the interstate, speed steadily increasing, I couldn’t get the symbol out of my mind.

Did I imagine the detail?

Was it just a weird trick of the light, shadows dancing across his palm in such a way that it gave the impression of something that wasn’t actually there?

If the scar *was* real, then what the hell did it mean?

My attention drifted from the vacant highway to a passing billboard for only a fraction of a second. When my attention shifted back, I felt my heart detonate against the back of my throat.

There was a rapidly approaching bumper. I slammed on the brakes. The sharp chemical odor of burning rubber invaded my nostrils. I braced for impact.

My sedan thudded to a painful, suspension-destroying stop at what felt like the last possible second. The very tip of my car clinked gingerly against their license plate. Don’t think the driver even looked up from their phone.

The war drum beating in my chest slowed, and slowed, and slowed, and then I finally let myself breathe.

Gridlock was unusual for the early afternoon, but I had a sneaking suspicion as to the reason behind it. I grabbed a half-empty pack of Newports from the cupholder, stuck a cigarette between my still-trembling lips, and rolled down the window. Damp summer air coated my exposed skin. I felt my forearm stick to the hot plastic as I pulled my head out to get a better view of the holdup.

There was a plume of smoke in the distance, maybe a quarter mile ahead of the traffic. No nearby construction signage, either. As I lowered myself back into the car, my mouth was dry and my mind was racing. They’d been happening more and more recently. If I saw two on the way to the grocery store, and three on my way home, that’d be under the average. A good day, all things considered.

In the past year, the number of car accidents that occurred across my fair city had skyrocketed.

Most were mild. Fender-benders. Distracted drivers who poorly estimated how fast a car was going, or how far away they were. Some were more serious. A small proportion resulted in fatalities, and, if the press was to be believed, an even smaller proportion of the collisions were both tragically fatal *and* alarmingly inexplicable.

Inexplicable how? Well, it was tough to say. Local journalists waltzed elegantly around the details, hinting at *some* unexplainable aspect of the wrecks while diligently reporting the carnage.

I remember the title of one article read:

*“In a crash that has police puzzled, totaled SUV discovered around small bus. 15 killed. Only surviving victim remains comatose and unable to provide further details.”*

I’m sorry - the SUV was *around* the bus? How exactly would that work?

Mechanistically, what possible circumstances could have led to that outcome?

The article itself focused exclusively on memorializing the victims, which, although admirable, left us layfolk more than a little confused.

Pictures of the dead before the crash? Yes.

Pictures of the crash itself? Conspicuously absent.

Many DUI checkpoints and anti-texting-while-driving initiatives later, nothing much had changed. The crashes were only becoming more frequent as time went on.

Suffice it to say, I experienced a gnawing dread about what might lie beneath the plume of smoke.

Speaking of smoke, the cancer stick did wonders massaging my frayed nerves into a state of tenuous relaxation. I inched through the traffic without succumbing to a panic attack. Half an hour later, I was scooting by the crash itself, though I had a hard time comprehending what I was looking at.

I lit another cigarette.

There was just a heap of tangled metal. A ball of harsh silvery edges shimmering in the midday sun, seemingly closer to what would come out of a car blender than a collision on the interstate.

Where did the first vehicle start and the other vehicle end?

Were there more than two in that unintelligible mess?

And, most chillingly, what chance did *anyone* have to survive such a crash?

My eyes traced various lines of coherent metal as they dipped in and out of the shattered steel nucleus, figuring that if I could wrap my head around its interlocking knots and snarls, then I could mentally wring it all out. Unravel the crash like a length of twisted yarn until, inevitably, I was left with the cars that created it, each full and perfect. From there, I’d finally understand how it happened.

I thought if I could understand it, then I’d be safe.

The sound of a blaring horn behind me ruptured my trance. Unconsciously, I had come to a complete stop at the crux of the bottleneck. I pressed my foot on the gas and sped forward, trying to focus on the drive home, trying to stay in the moment, trying not to ruminate on something I didn’t understand for once in my life and just move on.

Surprisingly, I was successful; I didn’t dwell on the crash, but only because another incomprehensible image seemed more pressing.

An “X” covered at the top with a small tail.

An hourglass with an open trapdoor at the bottom.

One that I felt myself falling through, dropping deeper with each passing second.

\- - - - -

The stench pummeled my body like an avalanche.

My apartment never smelled good - not in the years I’d lived there - but that evening, the odor was uniquely abrasive. Sulfurous, sour, and sweet. A scent that landed somewhere between spoiled tofu and an oozing septic tank.

I slammed the door shut and threw my bag onto the kitchen island. Plastic sushi trays containing petrified ores of unused wasabi clattered to the floor, making room. I held my breath, surveying the kitchen, assessing for the source. There was a bevy of potential culprits: the partially eaten microwave dinners covering the countertops, whatever prehistoric takeout skulked in the darkest corners of my fridge, the once verdant spider plant that was beginning to show signs of rot, et cetera, et cetera.

Ultimately, I’d need to breathe deep if I wanted to locate the proverbial needle in the haystack.

I didn’t have to search very hard. With willing nostrils, the putrid odor promptly escorted me to a small crevice between my workbench and the nearby wall, where a discarded box of half-eaten lo mien laid in wait, hidden for God knows how long. I delivered the biohazard to my building’s trash chute immediately, holding it by the tip of a sodden white fold like it was the tail of a long-dead rat.

Crisis averted.

When I returned, the apartment still smelled, but it was its familiar, baseline reek, and I found that to be acceptable.

I wasn’t always so grubby.

As a kid, my bedroom sparkled. I could manage the responsibility because my internal fixations were incredibly narrow, practically pinpointed. If I kept my room immaculate and got perfect grades, I was good, I was safe.

Age, to my chagrin, introduced an infinite-feeling rogues’ gallery of additional topics to helplessly fixate on: romance, politics, existential terror, climate change, mortality, morality, drugs, STDs, taxes, real estate, sex, desire, prestige, heart attacks, dementia, on, and on, and on, like gas expanding against the seams of my skull, threatening to break it wide open, splattering my precious neural jelly all over my socially adjusted peers, staining their nice, white clothes a visceral red-blue.

My twenties were rough.

For a while, I simply existed. Not alive. Not dead. Paralyzed through and through.

The pursuit of inner peace led me to group meditation, but I couldn’t just sit; I needed something that cleared my mind but kept my body moving. A friend recommended calligraphy. I tried it, and for the first time in my life, I tasted harmony. I found something I could get lost in, something that released the pressure in my skull.

From there, I made the mysterious beauty of written language a career.

With the stench tackled, I settled at my workbench. The space was tidy. The oak gleamed. The overhead lights had freshly replaced bulbs, and the lens of my standing magnifying glass was clear and dustless.

I opened the manila folder, flicked the lights on, spread the documents across the oak, and lost myself.

But only for a little while.

***“Thread’s Loose. Be back soon.”***

I figured I’d tackle the notes one by one, comparing their handwriting to older samples provided by Detective Ambrose. Before I could start, however, something caught my eye. A subtle discrepancy between the notes that I hadn’t detected on a cursory examination.

The strange, captivating embellishments weren’t *completely* identical, as I first thought. One flourish differed.

There was a small dash coming off the last letter, the “n”. That was true for each note. However, the dashes weren’t all going in the same direction.

One moved up at an angle, one was straight, and one went down at an angle.

Suddenly, the writing felt magnetic. I couldn’t peel myself away. My eyes refused to blink, galvanized to the lettering. My attention made a cyclic pilgrimage from one note to the next, studying the variation with reverence and awe.

Up, across, down.

I started hearing something I didn’t recognize. A noise that didn’t belong in my apartment. A noise that didn’t belong *anywhere*.

Up, across, down.

A quiet, lawless tapping. A thousand fingernails clicking against marble - manic, hungry, forlorn.

Up, across, down.

The anarchic noise got louder. A riot filled my ears, no room for anything else. The sound was like a chest-high wave of centipedes was advancing towards me, tethered hides futilely knocking into each other as they desperately tried to untangle themselves, tapping, tapping, tapping.

Up, across, down.

The embellishments developed depth.

The photograph cracked and splintered like expanding ice.

The letters unzipped.

If squinted, if I positioned my head *just* right, I could spy something between the cracks.

The hideous tapping reached a fever pitch.

Then, there was knocking at my door.

*“Viv! Viv, you home?”* a muffled voice asked.

I leapt back, my chair clattering behind me, my heartbeat thumping and rabid.

When I looked to the door, the tapping faded.

*“Jesus, Viv, you okay in there?”*

Wobbling, blurry vision wading through tides of vertigo, I moved to open the door. The deadbolt clicked and I cracked the door, just enough to show that I was indeed alive. Maggie had an itchy trigger finger when it came to phoning emergency services.

She was an empathetic friend and an accommodating next-door neighbor, but the sixty-something ex-beatnik was also a hell of a snoop. Wasn’t uncommon to see her striding up and down our floor, ears perked, patrolling for even the faintest wisps of gossip. Retirement had left her with nothing better to do. So even though her expression betrayed concern, there was an undeniable glint of curiosity swelling behind her eyes.

I ran a quivering hand through my hair, pulling strands slick with sweat from my face.

*“Yeah, Mags, I’m good, just working,”* I muttered.

Maggie shot me a sideways glance, penciled brows arched.

*“Right.”* she replied flatly. I shrugged, fighting the urge to push the door closed.

Her features softened, curiosity snuffed out, a parish of worry lines congregating along her forehead.

*“Sweetheart, I know you’re a bloodhound with your work - God bless and keep you - but I don’t think you know when to stop.”* She lifted a bottle of cheap, nutmeg-colored whiskey into view. *“Moreover, I have news about Mr. Peterson, and it’s ghastly, absolutely fucking harrowing. Care for a break?”*

I shifted nervously in the doorway, still rattled from what I’d just experienced, but wanting nothing more than to return to my workbench at the same time.

*“Sorry - I didn’t mean to phrase that like a question, because it ain’t. Get on out here, Viv.”*

A delicate smile crept across my face. I relented.

*“Ugh, fine. I’ll meet you on the roof in five. Gotta clean up in here.”*

Maggie sniffed cartoonishly, well aware of the man-made disaster that was my apartment.

*“You’ll be able to do that in five minutes?”*

My smile bloomed.

*“Nice one, Mags, real clever.”*

I shut the door.

To relax, I needed to tidy my workbench first. Figured I’d collect the documents into a neat pile, pull the chair upright, and then I’d be ready; I could attend to the notes at another time. There was no rush, and I was clearly a little out of sorts.

I almost convinced myself that what I experienced was just the hallucinogenic vacillations of an overburdened mind. A sort of cognitive spasm that was downstream of the detective’s unsettling behavior, the horrific collision, or low blood sugar - most likely some ungodly combination of all three.

But then I scanned the room.

I blinked.

I blinked again.

When that didn’t remedy the problem, I rubbed my eyes so strenuously that my vision temporarily blurred. Nothing changed.

My rolling chair was just…gone.

Wasn’t tipped over on my stain-riddled carpet, like it should’ve been.

I checked my bedroom: no chair.

I checked my bathroom: no chair.

I checked my single, multi-purpose closet: unless it’d somehow become buried deep within the mountain of microwave dinner boxes and old clothes, it wasn’t there either.

For a brief moment, my gaze flirted with the photographs still lurking atop my workbench. A gentle flurry of distant taps resonated against my eardrums, beckoning me.

I ripped myself away. Forced my eyes closed.

The sound promptly dissipated.

Pacing out of my apartment, I locked the door behind me and headed up to the roof, leaving my workbench cluttered for the first and last time.

\- - - - -

The roof was our sanctuary, our private serenity sequestered fifteen stories above the maddening bustle of the city. We’d made weekly visits to that place for as long as we’d been friends: eight and a half years, give or take. Pretty sure the landlord didn’t know about our trips, either.

Maggie was strangely proficient with a lock pick.

From the relative comfort of her two raggedy beach chairs, we watched the sun curve through the atmosphere, drenching the sky in its liquid gold. The bottom-shelf whiskey laminated my throat with the pleasant burn of a campfire. Intoxication coaxed out an edited recollection of my day, and it felt damn good. I smoothed out the stranger details, of course. She didn’t need to know about the unusual symbol or the frenetic tapping, but I did mention the vanishing chair.

*“I’m sure you’ll find it.""* Maggie reassured me. ""*You know, something like that happened to me recently. Something outlandish.”*

She passed the bottle, and I took another generous swig.

*“Tell me.”* I rasped, the taste of turpentine still crackling over my tongue.

*“Well…”*

Maggie paused; an uncharacteristic lapse in momentum. She was never one to mince words. The chair screeched against the rough concrete as she turned it to face me. Her frost-tinted eyes locked onto mine.

*“So, I was cutting a pizza the other day,”* she started.

*“As one does.”* I slurred.

*“Hush, child. Listen.”*

I placed the bottle on the concrete, sat up straight, and saluted her.

*“Yes, ma’am. Right away, ma’am.”*

She rolled her eyes.

*“Anyway, I’m cutting a pizza, and I make two cuts. To be clear, I’m sure I made two cuts: one vertical, one left to right. Separated it into four equal slices, same way I always do.”*

I nodded, curious about the anecdote’s punchline.

*“But, when I looked…”* she trailed off. Another pause. Maggie grabbed the bottle by the neck, and imbibed. One, two, three gulps for courage. Then she started again.

*“When I looked, there were only three pieces.”*

A sputtering chuckle erupted from my lips.

*“What? Mags, what the hell are you talking about? What do you mean, ‘there were only three pieces’?”*

Her face began to flush, and she looked away. Instant regret soured some of the whiskey sloshing around my gut.

She furiously gesticulated cutting a pizza in the air and repeated herself.

*“I put two equal cuts into the pizza, in the shape of a plus, like I’ve been doing since the day I was old enough to work an oven, and, somehow, I was left with three slices. How the fuck does that happen? Doesn’t make a lick of sense.”*

Her words came out sharp, as if it was painful to say any of it out loud. I reached over and rubbed her shoulder.

*“Hey - no worse than losing a chair. I think we’re both getting senile, you old bat. Like, you haven’t even told me the ‘ghastly’ news about Mr. Peterson, and that’s the gossip you led with…”*

Maggie sprang from her beach chair.

*“Oh my fucking god! Yes! I can’t believe I forgot. I mean, I’m glad I forgot for a little; shit was ghastly. Ain’t really gossip, either.”*

She began pacing in small, hectic circles.

*“So, I was doing my rounds - wandering from boredom - and I reached Mr. Peterson’s room, all the way on the opposite end of the hall. I rarely go that far, suppose I was particularly stir-crazy yesterday. You know him, right?”*

I nodded. He was a crotchety old man who owned the nearby laundromat. I’d suffered plenty of awkward elevator rides with him over the years. Small talk with the curmudgeon was basically impossible. Far as I could tell, we had only two things in common: we were both unmarried, and we both rented apartments at the very edge of our exceptionally wide complex.

*“I got to his door, and there was…a smell. A terrible, rotting smell, like roadkill. And…I don’t know, I feared the worst, so I knocked. No response, but the door creaked open a smidge. Needless to say, I was the person who found him. By the looks of it, he’d been dead a while.”*

*“Oh, Jesus…”* I whispered.

*“Viv - trust me, it gets much, much worse.”*

My pulse quickened.

*“He…he was naked, sprawled out on the floor. No head. No arms - well, no attached arms. Half his right leg removed at the knee.”*

She sighed, interrupted her frantic pacing, and peered up at the sky, as if she were beseeching God for a reasonable explanation to what she had witnessed.

*“His arms were folded over his chest, laid parallel to his shoulders so that his neck stump and his jagged arm knubs were all clustered together, elbows bent so his hands were covering his belly button. And…and his left leg - the one that was still sort of intact - they twisted it counterclockwise until the kneecap pointed away from the body. Bent that leg too, just like the arms: same forty-five degree angle. Oh! And they fuckin’ painted them, too, just the arms and the legs. Bright, bleedin’ red, all the way around. Made what was left of him look like some weird, fucked hieroglyphic.”*

Breath fled my lungs. My brain sizzled, cooking itself delirious.

A vision of the detective’s scar took form in my consciousness.

And I thought I could hear the tapping.

But it could’ve just been a memory.

I choked out seven small words: *“The shape…kind of…like an hourglass?”*

Maggie thought about it for a second. She seemed to register my simmering panic.

*“Uh…well, yeah, sort of.”*

*“And you’re sure he wasn’t newly dead?”*

*“Yes, Viv - I’m sure. Don’t plan on cursing you with those grisly details, but he’d clearly been dead a while. The officer I spoke with thought just as much when they came to pick him - his body - up.”*

My stomach lurched. I felt it vibrating like a harshly plucked string, fluttering violently against my abdominal muscles.

*“Was there…was there a note?”*

She forced a weak laugh.

*“What, like some last words? From Mr. Peterson, or his killer? Love, I have no fucking idea, and I didn’t walk in to find out - last I checked, I’m not a CSI.”*

I rocketed from my beach chair, knocking over the whiskey bottle in my turbulent haste.

*“Vivian, sweetheart - please, tell me what’s happening…”* she pleaded.

Without another word, I sprinted away, hyperventilating, tripping over my own feet.

Maggie called out after me, but I didn’t look back.

I tried to call Ambrose at the number he’d provided. When he didn’t pick up, I ordered an Uber.

If luck was on my side, the department would still be open.

\- - - - -

The elevator chimed. The doors crept apart to reveal the sublevel. I lumbered down the musty hallway.

Desperate rationalizations sprouted from my ailing psyche, more and more every second.

*Ambrose misspoke. Got the dates mixed up or something.*

*Maybe I misheard him. I could have misheard him.*

*Maggie was mistaken - Mr. Peterson had to have died yesterday.*

But the police just *learned* of him yesterday. Maggie’s no idiot, either. Doubt she’d confuse new death for prolonged decomposition. And nothing could explain the state of the body matching the scar on Ambrose’s palm.

I stumbled. The walls seemed to shudder as my body made contact. I stifled a shriek and pushed myself off the shivering plaster.

Had to keep moving, had to keep going.

The light in his cramped office was still on, still flickering, but Ambrose wasn't there.

Just then, the woman I’d held the elevator door for a few hours earlier stepped out of her office. I jogged up to her as she fumbled with a keyring.

*“Excuse me, excuse me -”* to my embarrassment, the words came out liquor-soaked: garbled, slow, and soft.

She twitched, startled, dropping her keys to the floor. The woman placed a trembling hand to her chest and turned to face me.

*“Heavens. Don’t you have better places to be, young lady?”*

I bent down, picked up her keys, and handed them over.

*“Sorry. The detective who works down the hall, have you seen him? Is he still here?”*

She cocked her head.

*“Ambrose?”* I clarified.

The woman shrugged. Her lips tightened into a narrow line. She returned to locking her office, the key finally clicking into place. When she pivoted back to me, her expression was scornful, irritated, but her indignation seemed to melt away upon getting a good look at my sorry state - body drunk, mind breaking.

*“Honey…is there someone I can call for you? Are you lost? Do you need help?”* she purred.

*“What? No. No, I had a meeting with a detective, last door on the left, a little after eleven this morning, and I need” -* abruptly, I belched - “*I need to speak with him right away.”*

When she still appeared hopelessly confused, I turned and pointed to his office.

Her eyes darted from the room, to me, and then to her feet. She sighed, exasperated, and then began digging through her purse.

*“Where is the detective who works in* ***that goddamn*** *office?”* I asked, tone much angrier than I intended.

The woman retrieved her cell phone, dialed, and placed it against her ear.

*“I don’t know how you keep getting in here, but I’m calling you an ambulance.”*

I considered grabbing my lanyard and waving my ID in front of her face. Before I could, however, she said something that crushed me completely.

*“Because, honey, that room is a* [*storage closet.”*](https://www.reddit.com/r/unalloyedsainttrina/comments/1j88zl3/welcome_to_a_very_chaotic_horror_subredditupdated/)",5,1759253963.0,Odd_directions,1,1.0,False

We’ve been living together in the same apartment for about six months now. Recently, we decided to move into a bigger 2-bedroom place since we both work from home. From the start, Clark made it clear that he sees me like a little sister he cares about.

Meanwhile, my ex-fiancé recently came back to the country and reconnected with me. To give context: my ex and I were together for 7 years, but we broke up mutually because of career differences. There was no big drama we ended things on good terms, and I’m still close with his family.

Every now and then, my ex calls me to catch up or discuss his business. Whenever that happens, Clark always asks what the call was about. At first, I thought he was just being curious, but lately, he’s been more persistent about it.

One time, I was sick with the flu. Normally, Clark isn’t the type to fuss over me he’d just tell me to rest or sleep. But during that time, my ex happened to call and noticed I sounded really unwell. He offered to bring me medicine or take me to a clinic, but I told him not to worry. Clark overheard the whole thing since I was on speaker while working from my laptop.

Right after I hung up, Clark suddenly sat next to me with his own laptop, asking about my symptoms, what I wanted to eat, and insisting he’d handle meals that day. Later, he even came to my room and stayed on the couch, saying he wanted to keep an eye on me.

Another time, during my period, my ex mentioned he remembered I usually don’t feel well and offered to bring me snacks. Clark overheard that too and right away, he went grocery shopping, came back with all my favorite treats, plus pads, and told me to relax. He even set up Netflix so we could watch movies together all day.

Lately, I’ve noticed that if my ex and I meet for coffee (usually to talk about work), Clark will question me when I get home almost like he’s trying to figure out if we talked about him. His behavior is starting to confuse me.

So now I’m stuck wondering… Clark says he sees me as a sister, but his actions don’t always match that. What should I do to figure out where this is really going?

1nujo26,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlugAndProof/comments/1nujo26/should_you_buy_the_best_espresso_machine_breville/,Should You Buy the Best Espresso Machine Breville Barista Touch,"Ever since I got my hands on the Breville BES880BSS, it's been a coffee lover's dream come true. This brushed stainless steel espresso machine makes every morning not just a routine but a delicious experience. As someone who values a good cup of coffee, I couldn't resist testing every feature this machine had to offer. While it’s one of the most user-friendly and customizable espresso machines I’ve used, there are a few points to think about before making it your kitchen centerpiece.

**Design and Build Quality**

The sleek, brushed stainless steel finish immediately caught my attention. It has a modern yet professional vibe, complementing my kitchen perfectly. With dimensions of 12.7”D x 15.5”W x 16”H, it’s not the most compact and does take some countertop real estate. However, it feels sturdy, and its premium look screams high quality. Everything about the build, from the integrated grinder to the touch screen display, gives it a sense of reliability. Even after weeks of daily brews, it’s held up without a hitch.

**Key Benefits**

- The digital touchscreen is intuitive and simplifies the process from bean to cup.
- Built-in precision conical burr grinder ensures freshly ground coffee every time, delivering maximum flavor.
- ThermoJet heating system heats up in just 3 seconds – I don’t have to wait for ages for my morning espresso.
- The milk texturing with an automatic steam wand produces barista-quality microfoam. It's perfect for latte art (I have mostly mastered hearts and leaves—still working on the swan).

[Check Breville BES880BSS price on Amazon.](https://applegreenshop.com/p/b078wmlxxg/)

**User Experience: The Brewing Process**

Operating this espresso machine feels like having a personal barista. The touchscreen walks you through making coffee in three easy steps: grind, brew, and milk. Customization is where this machine truly shines. I love how you can adjust coffee strength, milk texture, and temperature to suit individual tastes. My friends often rave about how I can tweak it just for their specific preference. I’ve even saved a few drinks on the machine, as it lets you create and store up to 8 personalized coffees.

The machine’s integrated water filter and reusable filter ensure top-notch espresso extraction without compromising on flavor. Additionally, it handles pre-programmed café favorites effortlessly. However, if you prefer more personalized espresso, the adjustable grind control and programmable options will exceed your expectations.

**Performance and Flavor**

The quality of espresso extraction is where the Breville BES880BSS shines the most. The low-pressure pre-infusion and PID digital temperature control play significant roles in achieving balanced, full-bodied espresso shots. Every sip is rich, with no bitterness in sight—it's pure coffee heaven. One of my coworkers, who often visits, jokingly calls my kitchen ""a mini café."" My go-to order? A flat white with creamy, airy foam that feels like velvet on the tongue.

While it’s perfect for espresso-based drinks like cappuccinos and lattes, the machine also provides hot water functionality for tea or americanos. 

**Negatives**

- The price isn’t for the faint-hearted; this machine definitely leans toward the luxury side of coffee makers.
- Cleaning up, particularly maintaining the grinder and milk texturing system, requires care and frequent attention.
- It’s not the quietest machine. Early mornings often involve a bit of grinding noise, which might not sit well with light sleepers.

**Competing Products**

When comparing this espresso machine with other coffee machines on the market, a few names come to mind. The De’Longhi Dinamica is a solid rival, offering a simpler interface and comparable coffee quality. However, it falls a little short in terms of customization and heating speed. The Philips 4300 Series is another challenger, but its milk frothing capabilities don’t match the Breville’s barista-quality output. Ultimately, the Breville stands out for its versatility and ability to meet the demands of experienced espresso enthusiasts.

**Worth Every Penny**

Considering its robust features and high-quality performance, the Breville BES880BSS is more than just a coffee maker—it’s an investment. While it might feel slightly on the higher end financially, it provides the kind of café-quality coffee and convenience that is tough to beat. Whether you’re a casual drinker or an aspiring home barista, this machine has something for everyone. From its sleek design to exceptional brewing capabilities, you truly get what you pay for.

1nujn3r,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewVoyage/comments/1nujn3r/explore_if_the_bissell_little_green_cleaner/,Explore If the Bissell Little Green Cleaner Really Cuts Tough Stains,"Jumping straight into it, I’ve been testing the BISSELL 4178 Little Green Cleaner for a good while, and honestly, it’s been quite the workhorse. As someone who perpetually battles the chaos that comes with kids, a shedding pet, and the occasional coffee spill (courtesy of my own clumsiness), I’ve put this product through some intense real-world scenarios. Spoiler alert: it surprised me. However, there are a few quirks you should be aware of. 

**Compact Design and Portability**  
The space-saving design of the cleaning pouches is a huge plus for me. My cleaning closet is already a jungle of random sprays and bottles, so having a product that comes in streamlined packaging is a game-changer. I loved the individual pouches that just need to be opened and poured directly. There's zero measuring, zero mess. It’s perfect for someone like my sister, who has sworn off complicated cleaning routines. Also, the lightweight feature means I can carry it to the couch, car, or wherever the mess decides to relocate.  

**Pros**  
- Space-efficient design  
- Easy-to-use pouches with no spillage  
- Convenient for tackling random messes  

[Find the best price for BISSELL 4178 Little Green Cleaner on Amazon.](https://blog.sanue.com/p/b0f5qt348q/)  

**Performance on Stains and Odors**  
I spilled red wine on my off-white couch (classic) and decided to test the product’s triple-action cleaning formula. It didn’t just lift the stain; it left a subtle, fresh scent behind. The product claims to work on food stains, grease, and even pet messes. After multiple uses, I can confirm it delivers on every front. My friend brought over her overenthusiastic golden retriever, and a muddy paw incident on the carpet only took one round of cleaning to disappear—fragrance included. The odor-removal is pretty remarkable, and that fresh scent lingered for hours.  

**Drawbacks**  
- Pouches are single-use and not refillable  
- Struggles occasionally with deeply embedded stains  
- Best results seem tied to compatible BISSELL portable deep cleaners  

**Safe for Families and Pets**  
As a parent, I find myself scrutinizing cleaning products to ensure they're safe around my child and our dog, Max. This formula passes the test. It’s biodegradable, free from heavy metals or dyes, and contains earth-friendly detergents. Guilt-free cleaning? Sign me up. Max, who loves licking anything he shouldn't, made an unfortunate attempt on the freshly cleaned carpet. Knowing this was pet-safe gave me peace of mind.

**Strengths**  
- Pet- and kid-safe for worry-free cleaning  
- Biodegradable, earth-friendly formula  
- Made without heavy metals or dyes  

**Ease of Use**  
The no-mixing and no-measuring aspect honestly make it a standout product. I hate having to figure out dilution ratios or setting timers to ensure I don’t overdo it—this takes me straight to the action. The pre-measured pouches are ready to go immediately, making my cleaning routine so much simpler.  

**Challengers**  
In comparison with competitors such as Hoover’s carpet-cleaning formulas or popular brands like Resolve, the BISSELL option stands out for its portability and strong focus on safety around pets and kids. The Hoover options, while effective, can sometimes require more prep work and typically come in larger, less environmentally-friendly bottles. Resolve does well with smaller stains but doesn’t quite match the multi-purpose capability of BISSELL’s concentrated formula. However, if you already own a non-BISSELL cleaner, you might find some compatibility limitations with this formula.

**Value Proposition**  
It strikes a decent balance between price and performance. While the upfront cost per pouch might feel slightly on the higher side, the concentrated formula means you’re paying for quality and effectiveness. Plus, its compact and eco-friendly design makes the investment worth considering. If you hate bulky bottles taking over your storage space, this cleaner offers a real, practical solution.

1nujmwa,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1nujmwa/can_membrane_solutions_t33_inline_water_filter/,Can Membrane Solutions T33 Inline Water Filter Review Enhance Your Drinking Water Quality?,"The Membrane Solutions T33 Inline Water Filter is a solid companion for those of us who play the never-ending game of battling chlorine-infused tap water or sub-par icemaker brews. I decided to test out this specific post-carbon replacement cartridge for my refrigerator and reverse osmosis system, and I’ve got thoughts—both good and not-so-good—on how it performed during several months of daily use. Here's a breakdown of my experience with this clever little inline water filter.

**Initial Impressions and Installation Ease**  
Installing this inline carbon filter was ridiculously simple. Being someone who loses patience the moment something needs a screwdriver, I was delighted to see the built-in 1/4-inch quick-connect fittings. The entire setup felt like it was designed for water filter dummies (trust me, I’m one). The housing was pre-assembled, and all I had to do was pop the water tube into the connectors. No need to summon a plumber. It took less than two minutes—most of which was spent second-guessing whether it could honestly be this straightforward. Just make sure you’ve got the flow direction right, labeled “In” and “Out,” or things can get messy.

[Check Membrane Solutions T33 price on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b07nl2z7mn/)

**Taste and Odor Enhancement**  
Once installed, the coconut-based activated carbon started pulling its weight immediately. I have a particularly sensitive nose when it comes to “tap water smell,” and that issue became non-existent overnight. The chlorine taste vanished almost completely, leaving my drinking water fresher, cleaner, and just plain more pleasant. Even my skeptical better half (who thought filters like these are total snake oil) admitted to the noticeable improvement. Fun fact: My dog also stopped giving side-eyes to water from her bowl, so I take that as another vote of confidence. 

**Capacity and Lifespan**  
What really stood out to me was the long lifespan of these cartridges. The manual claims an incredible 12 months’ service time when used as a post-RO filter, or up to 2,000 gallons if running it as a primary inline filter. From my daily usage, I’d say the numbers seemed accurate. Just ensure you flush at least five gallons through before use; otherwise, you’ll get some carbon sediment in your glass. It's reusable for longer than most filters I’ve come across, making it really practical for both rubber ducks or heavy H2O drinkers like me.

**Compatibility Across Devices**  
This part was an unexpected “wow” factor. Whether you’re hooking it up to a refrigerator, RV sink, icemaker, coffee machine, or even a beverage cooler, the Membrane Solutions inline water filter pretty much suits any setup you throw at it. I personally tested it with both my refrigerator and countertop water cooler—both worked like a charm. According to the specs, this model has universal compatibility with Samsung, GE, Culligan, Whirlpool, and other big-name brands, so cross-brand worries won’t keep you up at night.

**Key Benefits**  
- Easy installation—perfect for users who aren’t DIY-savvy.  
- Noticeable taste and smell improvement in water.  
- Long lifespan, whether integrated into a whole system or used standalone.  
- Compatibility with a wide range of devices and brands.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
Every product has some quirks, and this inline water filter is no exception. Let’s talk about the not-so-perfect parts.  
- While it fits a standard 1/4-inch water line, anything different (say 1/2-inch or 3/4-inch connections) requires an adapter. Annoying, but not a dealbreaker.  
- The initial few gallons flushed produced slight black water. Normal for carbon filters, and while expected, it can alarm if you don’t read the manual.   
- No indicators for expiration or filter change alerts, so you’ve got to eyeball dates manually.  

**Competing Brands**  
Compared to other options on the market like Culligan IC-100A or the Omnipure K2533JJ, this replacement stands out for its ease of use and versatile compatibility. While the Culligan boasts slightly better filtration for very fine particles, its pricey replacement cartridges ding it for cost-efficiency. On the flip side, Omnipure has great filtering potential but lacks the durability of the Membrane Solutions T33. What really tips the scales here is the ability to switch this cartridge out across several different devices. That adaptability makes this particular model not just a household purchase but a great investment for outdoor rigs like RVs or boats.

**True Value**  
Is it worth it? That depends on your expectations. If you’re in the market for an economical, easy-to-install water filter replacement that performs terrifically in taste improvement, this one is a no-brainer. Sure, it isn’t the cheapest option, but when you factor in the cartridge lifespan and range of appliance compatibility, the overall quality-to-price ratio is hard to beat. Just consider the one-time adapter purchase if you have broader diameter pipes. All in all, this filter leans heavily into “worth every penny” territory without crossing into overpriced gadgetry.

1nujdmv,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuiltToTest/comments/1nujdmv/evaluate_the_best_electric_kettle_megachef_and_is/,Evaluate the best electric kettle Megachef and is it worth it,"Electric kettles have become a kitchen staple for me, and the MegaChef 1.8 Quarts Matte Black Tea Kettle was no exception. From the moment I took it out of the box, I could see it wasn’t just another appliance. It’s got a touch of retro charm with modern functionality. The matte black finish combined with rose gold accents made it feel more like a statement piece than just a kettle. It deserves a spot on the counter rather than hidden away in a cabinet. Naturally, it had to earn that place by proving its worth.

**Design and Aesthetic Appeal**  
I genuinely appreciate the thought put into the design of this kettle. Its half-circle silhouette combined with its matte finish and rose gold detailing gives it a luxurious look. I hadn’t expected something as mundane as a kettle to spark compliments, but I’ve caught a couple of friends glancing at it during conversations, eventually commenting on how sleek it looks. It’s not just about appearances, though. The compact size feels right for my kitchen setup, fitting into a corner of the counter without taking up too much space. The stainless steel finish doesn't only look great—it also helps with durability.  

**Performance for Everyday Use**  
Performance-wise, it packs 1500 watts, which means water boils faster than any stovetop kettle I’ve tried. Perfect for my early morning cup of tea when time feels limited. The built-in temperature gauge is something that’s surprisingly helpful. I’ve started using it to ensure my water doesn't overboil and ruin delicate teas or specialty coffee brews. What’s also worth mentioning is the water indicator window; it conveniently shows how much water is left or needs filling without any guesswork. 

[Grab MegaChef 1.8 Quarts at the best price on Amazon.](https://vendm.com/p/b0bg9b62sm/)  

**Safety and Convenience Features**  
One feature I’ve come to appreciate--especially with kids at home--is the boil-dry protection. It automatically shuts off if the kettle’s empty, preventing potential mishaps. Also, the cordless design makes it a breeze to pour and serve. The cordless base rotates 360°, which makes it easy to lift and set down from any angle. Pouring is genuinely drip-free, making it less of a hassle during rushed mornings when I’m juggling tasks. The cord storage underneath was an unexpected bonus as it keeps the counter neat and tidy.

**Strengths**  
- Elegant design with aesthetic rose gold accents.  
- Fast water boiling with 1500W power.  
- Boil-dry protection adds an extra layer of safety.  

**Drawbacks**  
- The spout filter could have been sturdier; it requires careful handling during cleaning.  
- Matte finish, while beautiful, is prone to visible smudges and fingerprints.  

**Product Comparisons**  
Comparing this kettle to the Cuisinart CPK-17, which I used previously, reveals some differences. The Cuisinart offers presets for specific temperatures, which might be great for someone deeply interested in precision brewing. However, it’s bulkier and lacks the stylish retro look of the MegaChef. Fellow OXO Brew Electric Pour-Over Kettle users might argue their product offers better control for specialty coffee drinkers thanks to its gooseneck design. Yet, it doesn’t match the MegaChef’s versatility when serving multiple cups with ease. If you’re after more personality in design and standard boiling functionality, the MegaChef edges out as the better pick.

**Value for Money**  
Assessing the price-to-quality ratio, I find this kettle offers satisfying value for its striking design and high performance. Other kettles in the same price range don’t come with the design elegance or thoughtful features this one has. Its combination of style and reliable performance makes it feel like a premium option despite sitting in the midrange price category.

I’m watching this documentary on the life inside Sudan’s refugee camps, and the kids get excited when they eat rats. When they have nothing to eat, they eat the leaves. They have a small first aid kit that most people have in their house, but it’s supposed to be shared amongst 3,000 people. Women are killed if they are shown crying when their husbands die. There’s no electricity and very little infrastructure in Sudan. Sadly, there’s very little media attention, so there’s not much foreign aid to help out with the famine. 

Then compared to the war in Gaza, I have an easier time emphasizing with the civilians in Gaza, even though the situation is better than in Sudan, if that makes sense. I saw a teenage boy vlog about playing Fortnite for the first time in a long time. As someone who is an avid video gamer, that hits a chord within me. It’s valid to feel depressed about not playing your favorite online game in the past few years. The situation in Sudan feels very foreign to me in the same way that North Korea that does, where I can’t really put myself in their shoe because it’s on a different plane of a crisis that I have a hard time imagining. I saw an instagram of a mom who went to charge her phone at a nice coffee shop, and she reminisced about the luxury coffee shops with great interior design and reservations. When I was in debt last year and had to adjust my budget, it was painful not going to coffee shops. That I can empathize with. I don’t want to diminish the civilians who were killed in the crossfire. War is still tragic. After watching the situation in Sudan, I’m glad that at least aid is coming in for the Palestinians, and there are restaurants they can go to. I'm glad they have their phones and internet to have some form of escapism. Honestly, I hope the war is over soon. This was just an observation I made today while watching documentaries at work. Do you have a similar conclusion to mine? How knowledgeable are you about the civil war in Sudan?

1nuj8g0,https://www.reddit.com/r/fasting/comments/1nuj8g0/unintentional_fastingjust_how_ive_lived/,Unintentional Fasting/Just how I've lived,"Hello, id like to start out with saying I've been seeing more posts across most social media about fasting. This has come as a consequence of the videos being shared with me via my Dad typically. He has been on a health kick recently because he is in the midst of his diagnosis of Vasculitis MRO. 

Watching these videos there seems to be a general theme of effects that happen when you fast at 14, 24, 72 hours etc and I'm curious on doing a 72 hour water only fast. 

A little background about my eating habits would be that since highschool I've typically always skipped breakfast and lunch. This was because we were a low income household and some personal family problems never led to me worrying about it anyway. But by no means does this mean I've stuck to the dinner only routine very strictly, I'd eat lunch sometimes for weeks. Never really a schedule other than that guaranteed big meal at the end of the day. 

As of July 7th I'm one year sober from alcohol and have been with my partner for nearly 2 years now so that's what I'm going to model my most recent eating habits off of, one meal a day, typically around dinner time at 6pm has been our standard for some time now. 

Regarding weight I stick around 160-180 and I'm able to shed or gain that back pretty easily. I don't feel any worse at 160 than I do at 180. I'm blessed with a very good(?) metabolism I think. I've not really had any issues with body fat or anything I'd consider as extra mass. This does lead me to being colder than most a lot of the time I feel like. A majority of the things I drink are typically water and coffee, lots of sugar but I'm working on cutting that out, and sometimes Ill have a stint of drinking energy drinks but it typically doesn't last more than a week and a half. 

However the question regarding the 72 hour, water only fast is to address issues with my gut. I believe the vodka ruined a lot of the processes that go on down there and I used it heavily for 10 years. I'm curious on the autophagy and healing of the gut mostly, and mostly if it could be more detrimental to me if I proceed to do this fast. 

Other notable things are that I rarely get sick, my farts don't smell (odd but I'll add it) and I don't typically smell if I go without a shower for a few days. I do feel lethargic sometimes if I eat during the day, like a lunch provided by work or something, will make me feel like I'm going to crash a couple hours later. 

I'd also like to say Im not looking for any medical advice just opinions from others who fast regularly or maybe some tips to point me in the right direction for information.

\- 280 lbs (nearly a year ago - around July 2025)  
\- Today 230 lbs  
\- 6'

How?  
\- Tracking my calories. It's really just that. I know it's a pain in the ass, but it's the secret sauce.  
\- Proof: Image 2, look how the weight follow the calories eaten.

Food  
I really like simplicity, quick to make, cheap to buy and as less dishes to wash as possible.  
\- Carbs: Smashed potato, rice, ramens, beans, tuna  
\- Proteins: Chicken, red meat, eggs, protein bars, protein shakes  
\- Vegetables & fruits: Free for all  
\- Drinks: Water and sparkling water  
\- Dairy products: As less a possible. Full of calories  
\- Pre workout or black coffee for extra energy  
\- Overall: Pretty tasteless food, but I don't mind

Trainings  
I don't like push and pull training. I prefer to target 2 muscles each time, and go all in. 4 exercises for each muscle. Each muscle: 4 x 10reps in average.  
\- Chest & Biceps (4 exo of chest, 4 exo of biceps)  
\- Back and triceps (same)  
\- Full legs (Quad, hamstring, calves)  
\- Shoulders, abs and other weaknesses  
\- Throw some cardio each day or second day and that's sit. (15min to 1h)

Side notes  
\- Ive been training in and out from like 16 yo.  
\- Goal of mine: benching 5 plates without ever taking sauce.  
\- When I was young, I player GTA and realized that each time I used the glitches, the game became meaningless. Never cut corners.

For reference, I’m like a true/warm autumn in depth, but I resonate with the neutral-warm temperature of deep autumn. Artificial light on the left and natural on the right, but sadly neither looks totally accurate.

Mac Crème in Your Coffee and Revlon Rum Raisin have similar vibes, but Coffee is more muted.

Chili is intense on me and I feel the need to tone it down with a darker liner. Maybe it’s better for people who are in the warm autumn to warm spring range. I find Toast of New York to be a more subtle red that I can throw on without much thought. 

I regret buying Velvet Teddy because it is too muted on me and is probably great for soft autumns. I prefer Kinda Sexy or Sweet Deal for a pinkish nude. KS shows up way lighter on my lips than it does on my arm, and I first bought it when concealer lips were trendy. SD is more of an everyday shade.

Decided to take a break for coffee, and thought I'd post here to see if I'm alone (likely not, from what I've been reading).

  
So — How're you doing now, in whatever role you're in, and what are your tips / hacks / whatever you call them to be more productive, make work more bearable perhaps, and have fun in your job?

I'll start off:

* **Snippets and Text Expanders**
   * I use Raycast but there're a ton of tools out there that can do the same thing. 
   * Whenever I find myself using the same text frequently, I'll create a snippet for it. 
   * For example, ""/vid1"" automatically expands into a link with a short walkthrough of the solution, ""/cal"" expands into my Calendly link for customers to schedule meetings with me, etc.
* **ChatGPT for Tone and Professional Emails**
   * We're all tired of AI, but I find myself occasionally at a loss on how I should respond to an unreasonable customer, or how I can apologize for the hundredth time that a feature a customer was promised isn't ready. 
   * So I created a project with instructions to rephrase anything I enter in a professional manner. I'm a firm believer that even when using AI we should learn from it to improve and not just take the output for granted, so my instructions also include giving me feedback why the changes were made. 
   * I also use a website called Goblin Tools that was designed for neurodivergent people which has been pretty helpful in turning my unprofessional thoughts into a client-facing email.
* **Dictation and Speech-to-Text**
   * My wrists have been hurting lately due to all the time spent on my desktop and laptop, so I've been relying more on dictation apps.
   * I generally start the recording, ramble out an email while checking related emails, notes, etc., for information, then clean up the output lightly before sending them out.
* **Take Breaks!!!**
   * I used to sit at my desk for 8 hours straight, only getting up for a water / pee break. Ended up causing me neck and shoulder problems. Don't be like me. :(
   * Standing desk changed my life, but if you don't have the budget (took me some time to save up for it), set reminders to walk around, stretch, dance even lol. Before I had my standing desk, I'd use my dictation app to draft emails while standing and just rotate my wrists and ankles for a bit.
* **Make it a Game**
   * This is a little odd I know, but I was burnt out several months back, and came across this Reddit post about choosing a random word daily and finding ways to sneak it into a conversation.
   * I do this once in awhile when I've several meetings a day and I'm exhausted. For example, ChatGPT gives me the word ""synergy"", and in a meeting I'll say something like, ""both teams need to have synergy to ensure this project is a success"" (I'm probably wrong, haven't tried this exact sentence oops).

Well that's all I can think of, and I've just finished my coffee. Hoping I hear from some of you on how your day went. :)

1nuj2bc,https://i.redd.it/h4fkorcp4csf1.jpeg,"A note left by each of the bodies read: ""Thread's loose. Be back soon.""","
Three deaths.

One after the other, each separated by exactly one week’s time, and the circumstances were bafflingly similar. Nearly identical, actually.

Each victim lived alone.

Each victim died in the same manner.

And each victim left the same note.

One thing was certain: the deaths were not natural. That left foul play or suicide, but, according to Detective Ambrose, neither explanation really made much sense. That didn’t stop people from developing an opinion, though.

The conundrum left the department precariously split: half the bullpen thought murder, the other half thought suicide. Tensions were mounting. The hung jury was getting restless. Historically even-keeled officers were instigating screaming matches over the topic. They needed a tiebreaker: information that could put the mystery to bed. For the victims, sure, but also for the department’s sanity.

That’s where I came in, he said.

The detective paused.

*“Come on in and sit down whenever the mood suits you, I suppose,”* he grumbled.

I guess it was wishful thinking to believe he’d let me listen to the entire briefing from the safety of the doorway.

From where I stood, his office looked like a war zone.

Stacks of overstuffed boxes rose high against every available inch of wall, jaundice-colored documents leaking from soggy cracks and bulging lids. A lone bulb, dangling from exposed wires that snaked up into the ceiling, cast the room in a meager glow. There *technically* was an available chair - a rickety, dangerous-looking thing, its cracked seat sloping leftward because of its uneven, rust-covered legs - but I’d have to move carefully through the dimly lit space to reach it.

*“Yeah, of course,”* I replied. Reluctantly, I tiptoed inside.

A faint fungal aroma lingered in the air, stale and tangy, like a cup of stagnant orange juice bristling with hungry mold. Stray documents lurked on the floor, some visible, others concealed within a thin layer of darkness where the light couldn’t reach. Slipped more than once, but thankfully, I did not fall. After a minute of tedious navigation, I planted myself down wordlessly, cautious not to clip the empty coffee cups lining the edge of his desk with my bag.

*“Sorry about the mess - my actual office is currently being renovated.”*

I nodded and shot him a weak, sympathetic smile, though I couldn’t help but wonder if this particular civil servant was on a red-eye flight to the unemployment line.

Felt like I’d met every agent in my decades of freelance work, but I hadn’t met Ambrose. Judging from the state of his “office” - the downright cataclysmic levels of disarray - there may have been a good reason for that. The man was no spring chicken, either. Wrinkles, liver spots, and a pair of cataract-stricken eyes combined to form something akin to a face below a mop of frizzy white hair.

Not that I was really in a position to criticize. My apartment was just as bad, if not worse, and I’d recently found myself on the wrong side of my late forties.

I eased into that deathtrap of a chair. For a moment, he just stared at me, elbows resting on the desk, hands clasped. The bulb flickered. He disappeared and then reappeared from the resulting blackness, but he did not move, nor did he blink.

*“…so, you'd like me to weigh in on the notes?”* I asked.

*“Ah, yes!”* he squealed. Ambrose visibly winced at his own reaction. His cheeks became flushed. He coughed vigorously, as if clearing phlegm, which only reddened his cheeks further.

*“Yes, yes...the notes...”* he reiterated in a deeper voice.

The detective tore three sheets from a nearby file.

*“Here’s the rub, Vivian: as far as we can tell, these victims never interacted with each other; not in any meaningful way, and yet, they all left one of these behind in their wake.”*

He handed me three black-and-white photographs, each centered on three differently shaped scraps of paper, each featuring the same five words:

***“Thread’s loose. Be back soon.”***

And just like that, in spite of his strangeness, he had my undivided attention. Wild curiosity coiled around my heart: a python twisting about weakened prey, almost ready to squeeze.

*“Now, if you buy the bullshit theory that these three killed themselves, I guess you could call them ‘suicide notes,’”* the detective continued, revealing his take on the “murder vs. suicide” controversy.

As he spoke, I fanned the pictures out. Compared them side-by-side.

*“I don’t call them suicide notes, though, ‘cause they don’t read like dying words to me; more like a strange calling card, the pretentious droppings of some knock-off, store-brand Zodiac Killer, getting a hard-on imagining us scratching our heads over their grand cipher.”*

The letters had…embellishments. Ornamentations. Flourishes as artistic as they were enigmatic.

In my twenty years of forensic document examination, I hadn’t ever seen anything like it.

There was a crescentic curl spinning clockwise off the bottom of the “T”. The “d” harbored three crisp, horizontal dots within its confines. The capital “B” had an extra bowl stacked on top of the normal two, looking like a pair of brass knuckles modified to fit a three-fingered mafioso. Each note’s handwriting was distinct, yes, but the flourishes? They appeared eerily identical.

*“No signs of forced entry at any of the crime scenes, no fingerprints on the murder weapons, and the handwriting seems to match each victim, at least to our untrained eyes.”*

He yanked the photos away and slid them into a manila folder. I struggled against the impulse to pull them back.

*“So - you’ll need to tell us if the notes are forgeries. If they are, that suggests one person wrote all three, which suggests murder. If they aren’t, I suppose they must have been suicides.”*

An impish smirk slithered across his face.

*“Can’t be both, right?”*

*“Not in my experience, no,”* I replied bluntly, a little exhausted by the man’s loopy behavior.

After a few more minutes of talking shop, the briefing concluded. I stood up and reached across the desk, offering the detective my hand. He did not shake it. No, the man just examined it.

Ambrose looked it over closely, like I was handing him a kitchen knife blade first and he was unsure of a safe place to grasp it. Eventually, I allowed my palm a tactical retreat, shoving the spurned digits into my pants pocket and turning to stumble my way out of the office.

Before officially departing, I realized I was missing some crucial information.

*“Remind me - how did they die?”* I asked from the doorway.

He closed his eyes, leaned back, and scratched his chin.

*“I think that’s out of your scope, Vivian,”* he muttered.

My pulse quickened. I felt the hard, gritty friction of grinding teeth and the boiling unease of growing rage.

*“Sir - Detective Ambrose - with all due respect, I’ve worked hand-in-hand with your department for decades. It hasn’t always been a perfectly amicable relationship, but not once has a detective outright refused to give me pertinent information.”*

***“That’s out of your scope, Vivian.*****”** He repeated himself, but much louder, over-enunciating each syllable, giving the statement an almost concussive quality - a series of rapid punches aimed at my torso. Despite the shouting, that impish smirk never left his face. He bellowed straight through the smile like it wasn’t even there.

The outburst left me slack-jawed. My head swiveled, peering down the hall, looking for someone to act as an impromptu referee for this bizarre interaction, to no avail. Ambrose’s office was in the station’s sublevel. Foot traffic was minimal.

When I looked back, he was *waving* at me. A stiff and exaggerated *bon voyage* that frightened me more than the shouting. It feels absurd to label the man an amateur at waving, but it truly looked like he was reenacting something he’d seen in a commercial once, rather than a normal, human gesture.

*“Thanks! This was fun. Bye now. My cell number should be in the file; let me know if you need anything!”* he boomed, visage strobing from the bulb flickering on and off.

My blood cooled. My rage wilted. I jogged off without responding, manila folder of documents tightly in hand. Knowing I had some work to sink my teeth into when I got home was the sole saving grace of the whole damn ordeal.

I paced towards the elevator. My eyes kept darting over my shoulder, half expecting to catch Ambrose in hot pursuit. He never was. Instead, I saw an elderly woman with thick bottle-cap glasses and a warm grin exiting one of the other offices. She implored me to hold the elevator as she shuffled rigidly across the sublevel’s tile flooring, so I stuck my hand over the sensor. The woman entered, thanked me, and we were finally on our way.

As I flung my car door shut, I wanted nothing more than to brush it off. Unfortunately, mental rumination is my god given talent. If dwelling were a sport, I’d be an Olympian. If perseveration could be monetized, I would have retired in the 80s a billionaire.

I couldn’t help myself.

For what felt like the fortieth time, I replayed his robotic, almost child-like wave in my head, trying - and failing - to discern *why* any self-respecting adult man would do such a thing. As the replays crested into the triple digits, a nagging detail started bubbling to the surface.

I saw something on his palm as he waved me off. Faded mounds of puckered skin organized into a very specific shape: a scar. The type of scar you don’t acquire by accident.

An equilateral triangle, point down, with two diagonal lines continuing beyond the point. Where one of them stopped, the other kinked at a ninety-degree angle and kept going, but only for a little longer. It resembled an hourglass with the bottom falling out like a trapdoor, or an “X” with the top covered and a small tail.

As I peeled down the interstate, speed steadily increasing, I couldn’t get the symbol out of my mind.

Did I imagine the detail?

Was it just a weird trick of the light, shadows dancing across his palm in such a way that it gave the impression of something that wasn’t actually there?

If the scar *was* real, then what the hell did it mean?

My attention drifted from the vacant highway to a passing billboard for only a fraction of a second. When my attention shifted back, I felt my heart detonate against the back of my throat.

There was a rapidly approaching bumper. I slammed on the brakes. The sharp chemical odor of burning rubber invaded my nostrils. I braced for impact.

My sedan thudded to a painful, suspension-destroying stop at what felt like the last possible second. The very tip of my car clinked gingerly against their license plate. Don’t think the driver even looked up from their phone.

The war drum beating in my chest slowed, and slowed, and slowed, and then I finally let myself breathe.

Gridlock was unusual for the early afternoon, but I had a sneaking suspicion as to the reason behind it. I grabbed a half-empty pack of Newports from the cupholder, stuck a cigarette between my still-trembling lips, and rolled down the window. Damp summer air coated my exposed skin. I felt my forearm stick to the hot plastic as I pulled my head out to get a better view of the holdup.

There was a plume of smoke in the distance, maybe a quarter mile ahead of the traffic. No nearby construction signage, either. As I lowered myself back into the car, my mouth was dry and my mind was racing. They’d been happening more and more recently. If I saw two on the way to the grocery store, and three on my way home, that’d be under the average. A good day, all things considered.

In the past year, the number of car accidents that occurred across my fair city had skyrocketed.

Most were mild. Fender-benders. Distracted drivers who poorly estimated how fast a car was going, or how far away they were. Some were more serious. A small proportion resulted in fatalities, and, if the press was to be believed, an even smaller proportion of the collisions were both tragically fatal *and* alarmingly inexplicable.

Inexplicable how? Well, it was tough to say. Local journalists waltzed elegantly around the details, hinting at *some* unexplainable aspect of the wrecks while diligently reporting the carnage.

I remember the title of one article read:

*“In a crash that has police puzzled, totaled SUV discovered around small bus. 15 killed. Only surviving victim remains comatose and unable to provide further details.”*

I’m sorry - the SUV was *around* the bus? How exactly would that work?

Mechanistically, what possible circumstances could have led to that outcome?

The article itself focused exclusively on memorializing the victims, which, although admirable, left us layfolk more than a little confused.

Pictures of the dead before the crash? Yes.

Pictures of the crash itself? Conspicuously absent.

Many DUI checkpoints and anti-texting-while-driving initiatives later, nothing much had changed. The crashes were only becoming more frequent as time went on.

Suffice it to say, I experienced a gnawing dread about what might lie beneath the plume of smoke.

Speaking of smoke, the cancer stick did wonders massaging my frayed nerves into a state of tenuous relaxation. I inched through the traffic without succumbing to a panic attack. Half an hour later, I was scooting by the crash itself, though I had a hard time comprehending what I was looking at.

I lit another cigarette.

There was just a heap of tangled metal. A ball of harsh silvery edges shimmering in the midday sun, seemingly closer to what would come out of a car blender than a collision on the interstate.

Where did the first vehicle start and the other vehicle end?

Were there more than two in that unintelligible mess?

And, most chillingly, what chance did *anyone* have to survive such a crash?

My eyes traced various lines of coherent metal as they dipped in and out of the shattered steel nucleus, figuring that if I could wrap my head around its interlocking knots and snarls, then I could mentally wring it all out. Unravel the crash like a length of twisted yarn until, inevitably, I was left with the cars that created it, each full and perfect. From there, I’d finally understand how it happened.

I thought if I could understand it, then I’d be safe.

The sound of a blaring horn behind me ruptured my trance. Unconsciously, I had come to a complete stop at the crux of the bottleneck. I pressed my foot on the gas and sped forward, trying to focus on the drive home, trying to stay in the moment, trying not to ruminate on something I didn’t understand for once in my life and just move on.

Surprisingly, I was successful; I didn’t dwell on the crash, but only because another incomprehensible image seemed more pressing.

An “X” covered at the top with a small tail.

An hourglass with an open trapdoor at the bottom.

One that I felt myself falling through, dropping deeper with each passing second.

\- - - - -

The stench pummeled my body like an avalanche.

My apartment never smelled good - not in the years I’d lived there - but that evening, the odor was uniquely abrasive. Sulfurous, sour, and sweet. A scent that landed somewhere between spoiled tofu and an oozing septic tank.

I slammed the door shut and threw my bag onto the kitchen island. Plastic sushi trays containing petrified ores of unused wasabi clattered to the floor, making room. I held my breath, surveying the kitchen, assessing for the source. There was a bevy of potential culprits: the partially eaten microwave dinners covering the countertops, whatever prehistoric takeout skulked in the darkest corners of my fridge, the once verdant spider plant that was beginning to show signs of rot, et cetera, et cetera.

Ultimately, I’d need to breathe deep if I wanted to locate the proverbial needle in the haystack.

I didn’t have to search very hard. With willing nostrils, the putrid odor promptly escorted me to a small crevice between my workbench and the nearby wall, where a discarded box of half-eaten lo mien laid in wait, hidden for God knows how long. I delivered the biohazard to my building’s trash chute immediately, holding it by the tip of a sodden white fold like it was the tail of a long-dead rat.

Crisis averted.

When I returned, the apartment still smelled, but it was its familiar, baseline reek, and I found that to be acceptable.

I wasn’t always so grubby.

As a kid, my bedroom sparkled. I could manage the responsibility because my internal fixations were incredibly narrow, practically pinpointed. If I kept my room immaculate and got perfect grades, I was good, I was safe.

Age, to my chagrin, introduced an infinite-feeling rogues’ gallery of additional topics to helplessly fixate on: romance, politics, existential terror, climate change, mortality, morality, drugs, STDs, taxes, real estate, sex, desire, prestige, heart attacks, dementia, on, and on, and on, like gas expanding against the seams of my skull, threatening to break it wide open, splattering my precious neural jelly all over my socially adjusted peers, staining their nice, white clothes a visceral red-blue.

My twenties were rough.

For a while, I simply existed. Not alive. Not dead. Paralyzed through and through.

The pursuit of inner peace led me to group meditation, but I couldn’t just sit; I needed something that cleared my mind but kept my body moving. A friend recommended calligraphy. I tried it, and for the first time in my life, I tasted harmony. I found something I could get lost in, something that released the pressure in my skull.

From there, I made the mysterious beauty of written language a career.

With the stench tackled, I settled at my workbench. The space was tidy. The oak gleamed. The overhead lights had freshly replaced bulbs, and the lens of my standing magnifying glass was clear and dustless.

I opened the manila folder, flicked the lights on, spread the documents across the oak, and lost myself.

But only for a little while.

***“Thread’s Loose. Be back soon.”***

I figured I’d tackle the notes one by one, comparing their handwriting to older samples provided by Detective Ambrose. Before I could start, however, something caught my eye. A subtle discrepancy between the notes that I hadn’t detected on a cursory examination.

The strange, captivating embellishments weren’t *completely* identical, as I first thought. One flourish differed.

There was a small dash coming off the last letter, the “n”. That was true for each note. However, the dashes weren’t all going in the same direction.

One moved up at an angle, one was straight, and one went down at an angle.

Suddenly, the writing felt magnetic. I couldn’t peel myself away. My eyes refused to blink, galvanized to the lettering. My attention made a cyclic pilgrimage from one note to the next, studying the variation with reverence and awe.

Up, across, down.

I started hearing something I didn’t recognize. A noise that didn’t belong in my apartment. A noise that didn’t belong *anywhere*.

Up, across, down.

A quiet, lawless tapping. A thousand fingernails clicking against marble - manic, hungry, forlorn.

Up, across, down.

The anarchic noise got louder. A riot filled my ears, no room for anything else. The sound was like a chest-high wave of centipedes was advancing towards me, tethered hides futilely knocking into each other as they desperately tried to untangle themselves, tapping, tapping, tapping.

Up, across, down.

The embellishments developed depth.

The photograph cracked and splintered like expanding ice.

The letters unzipped.

If squinted, if I positioned my head *just* right, I could spy something between the cracks.

The hideous tapping reached a fever pitch.

Then, there was knocking at my door.

*“Viv! Viv, you home?”* a muffled voice asked.

I leapt back, my chair clattering behind me, my heartbeat thumping and rabid.

When I looked to the door, the tapping faded.

*“Jesus, Viv, you okay in there?”*

Wobbling, blurry vision wading through tides of vertigo, I moved to open the door. The deadbolt clicked and I cracked the door, just enough to show that I was indeed alive. Maggie had an itchy trigger finger when it came to phoning emergency services.

She was an empathetic friend and an accommodating next-door neighbor, but the sixty-something ex-beatnik was also a hell of a snoop. Wasn’t uncommon to see her striding up and down our floor, ears perked, patrolling for even the faintest wisps of gossip. Retirement had left her with nothing better to do. So even though her expression betrayed concern, there was an undeniable glint of curiosity swelling behind her eyes.

I ran a quivering hand through my hair, pulling strands slick with sweat from my face.

*“Yeah, Mags, I’m good, just working,”* I muttered.

Maggie shot me a sideways glance, penciled brows arched.

*“Right.”* she replied flatly. I shrugged, fighting the urge to push the door closed.

Her features softened, curiosity snuffed out, a parish of worry lines congregating along her forehead.

*“Sweetheart, I know you’re a bloodhound with your work - God bless and keep you - but I don’t think you know when to stop.”* She lifted a bottle of cheap, nutmeg-colored whiskey into view. *“Moreover, I have news about Mr. Peterson, and it’s ghastly, absolutely fucking harrowing. Care for a break?”*

I shifted nervously in the doorway, still rattled from what I’d just experienced, but wanting nothing more than to return to my workbench at the same time.

*“Sorry - I didn’t mean to phrase that like a question, because it ain’t. Get on out here, Viv.”*

A delicate smile crept across my face. I relented.

*“Ugh, fine. I’ll meet you on the roof in five. Gotta clean up in here.”*

Maggie sniffed cartoonishly, well aware of the man-made disaster that was my apartment.

*“You’ll be able to do that in five minutes?”*

My smile bloomed.

*“Nice one, Mags, real clever.”*

I shut the door.

To relax, I needed to tidy my workbench first. Figured I’d collect the documents into a neat pile, pull the chair upright, and then I’d be ready; I could attend to the notes at another time. There was no rush, and I was clearly a little out of sorts.

I almost convinced myself that what I experienced was just the hallucinogenic vacillations of an overburdened mind. A sort of cognitive spasm that was downstream of the detective’s unsettling behavior, the horrific collision, or low blood sugar - most likely some ungodly combination of all three.

But then I scanned the room.

I blinked.

I blinked again.

When that didn’t remedy the problem, I rubbed my eyes so strenuously that my vision temporarily blurred. Nothing changed.

My rolling chair was just…gone.

Wasn’t tipped over on my stain-riddled carpet, like it should’ve been.

I checked my bedroom: no chair.

I checked my bathroom: no chair.

I checked my single, multi-purpose closet: unless it’d somehow become buried deep within the mountain of microwave dinner boxes and old clothes, it wasn’t there either.

For a brief moment, my gaze flirted with the photographs still lurking atop my workbench. A gentle flurry of distant taps resonated against my eardrums, beckoning me.

I ripped myself away. Forced my eyes closed.

The sound promptly dissipated.

Pacing out of my apartment, I locked the door behind me and headed up to the roof, leaving my workbench cluttered for the first and last time.

\- - - - -

The roof was our sanctuary, our private serenity sequestered fifteen stories above the maddening bustle of the city. We’d made weekly visits to that place for as long as we’d been friends: eight and a half years, give or take. Pretty sure the landlord didn’t know about our trips, either.

Maggie was strangely proficient with a lock pick.

From the relative comfort of her two raggedy beach chairs, we watched the sun curve through the atmosphere, drenching the sky in its liquid gold. The bottom-shelf whiskey laminated my throat with the pleasant burn of a campfire. Intoxication coaxed out an edited recollection of my day, and it felt damn good. I smoothed out the stranger details, of course. She didn’t need to know about the unusual symbol or the frenetic tapping, but I did mention the vanishing chair.

*“I’m sure you’ll find it.""* Maggie reassured me. ""*You know, something like that happened to me recently. Something outlandish.”*

She passed the bottle, and I took another generous swig.

*“Tell me.”* I rasped, the taste of turpentine still crackling over my tongue.

*“Well…”*

Maggie paused; an uncharacteristic lapse in momentum. She was never one to mince words. The chair screeched against the rough concrete as she turned it to face me. Her frost-tinted eyes locked onto mine.

*“So, I was cutting a pizza the other day,”* she started.

*“As one does.”* I slurred.

*“Hush, child. Listen.”*

I placed the bottle on the concrete, sat up straight, and saluted her.

*“Yes, ma’am. Right away, ma’am.”*

She rolled her eyes.

*“Anyway, I’m cutting a pizza, and I make two cuts. To be clear, I’m sure I made two cuts: one vertical, one left to right. Separated it into four equal slices, same way I always do.”*

I nodded, curious about the anecdote’s punchline.

*“But, when I looked…”* she trailed off. Another pause. Maggie grabbed the bottle by the neck, and imbibed. One, two, three gulps for courage. Then she started again.

*“When I looked, there were only three pieces.”*

A sputtering chuckle erupted from my lips.

*“What? Mags, what the hell are you talking about? What do you mean, ‘there were only three pieces’?”*

Her face began to flush, and she looked away. Instant regret soured some of the whiskey sloshing around my gut.

She furiously gesticulated cutting a pizza in the air and repeated herself.

*“I put two equal cuts into the pizza, in the shape of a plus, like I’ve been doing since the day I was old enough to work an oven, and, somehow, I was left with three slices. How the fuck does that happen? Doesn’t make a lick of sense.”*

Her words came out sharp, as if it was painful to say any of it out loud. I reached over and rubbed her shoulder.

*“Hey - no worse than losing a chair. I think we’re both getting senile, you old bat. Like, you haven’t even told me the ‘ghastly’ news about Mr. Peterson, and that’s the gossip you led with…”*

Maggie sprang from her beach chair.

*“Oh my fucking god! Yes! I can’t believe I forgot. I mean, I’m glad I forgot for a little; shit was ghastly. Ain’t really gossip, either.”*

She began pacing in small, hectic circles.

*“So, I was doing my rounds - wandering from boredom - and I reached Mr. Peterson’s room, all the way on the opposite end of the hall. I rarely go that far, suppose I was particularly stir-crazy yesterday. You know him, right?”*

I nodded. He was a crotchety old man who owned the nearby laundromat. I’d suffered plenty of awkward elevator rides with him over the years. Small talk with the curmudgeon was basically impossible. Far as I could tell, we had only two things in common: we were both unmarried, and we both rented apartments at the very edge of our exceptionally wide complex.

*“I got to his door, and there was…a smell. A terrible, rotting smell, like roadkill. And…I don’t know, I feared the worst, so I knocked. No response, but the door creaked open a smidge. Needless to say, I was the person who found him. By the looks of it, he’d been dead a while.”*

*“Oh, Jesus…”* I whispered.

*“Viv - trust me, it gets much, much worse.”*

My pulse quickened.

*“He…he was naked, sprawled out on the floor. No head. No arms - well, no attached arms. Half his right leg removed at the knee.”*

She sighed, interrupted her frantic pacing, and peered up at the sky, as if she were beseeching God for a reasonable explanation to what she had witnessed.

*“His arms were folded over his chest, laid parallel to his shoulders so that his neck stump and his jagged arm knubs were all clustered together, elbows bent so his hands were covering his belly button. And…and his left leg - the one that was still sort of intact - they twisted it counterclockwise until the kneecap pointed away from the body. Bent that leg too, just like the arms: same forty-five degree angle. Oh! And they fuckin’ painted them, too, just the arms and the legs. Bright, bleedin’ red, all the way around. Made what was left of him look like some weird, fucked hieroglyphic.”*

Breath fled my lungs. My brain sizzled, cooking itself delirious.

A vision of the detective’s scar took form in my consciousness.

And I thought I could hear the tapping.

But it could’ve just been a memory.

I choked out seven small words: *“The shape…kind of…like an hourglass?”*

Maggie thought about it for a second. She seemed to register my simmering panic.

*“Uh…well, yeah, sort of.”*

*“And you’re sure he wasn’t newly dead?”*

*“Yes, Viv - I’m sure. Don’t plan on cursing you with those grisly details, but he’d clearly been dead a while. The officer I spoke with thought just as much when they came to pick him - his body - up.”*

My stomach lurched. I felt it vibrating like a harshly plucked string, fluttering violently against my abdominal muscles.

*“Was there…was there a note?”*

She forced a weak laugh.

*“What, like some last words? From Mr. Peterson, or his killer? Love, I have no fucking idea, and I didn’t walk in to find out - last I checked, I’m not a CSI.”*

I rocketed from my beach chair, knocking over the whiskey bottle in my turbulent haste.

*“Vivian, sweetheart - please, tell me what’s happening…”* she pleaded.

Without another word, I sprinted away, hyperventilating, tripping over my own feet.

Maggie called out after me, but I didn’t look back.

I tried to call Ambrose at the number he’d provided. When he didn’t pick up, I ordered an Uber.

If luck was on my side, the department would still be open.

\- - - - -

The elevator chimed. The doors crept apart to reveal the sublevel. I lumbered down the musty hallway.

Desperate rationalizations sprouted from my ailing psyche, more and more every second.

*Ambrose misspoke. Got the dates mixed up or something.*

*Maybe I misheard him. I could have misheard him.*

*Maggie was mistaken - Mr. Peterson had to have died yesterday.*

But the police just *learned* of him yesterday. Maggie’s no idiot, either. Doubt she’d confuse new death for prolonged decomposition. And nothing could explain the state of the body matching the scar on Ambrose’s palm.

I stumbled. The walls seemed to shudder as my body made contact. I stifled a shriek and pushed myself off the shivering plaster.

Had to keep moving, had to keep going.

The light in his cramped office was still on, still flickering, but Ambrose wasn't there.

Just then, the woman I’d held the elevator door for a few hours earlier stepped out of her office. I jogged up to her as she fumbled with a keyring.

*“Excuse me, excuse me -”* to my embarrassment, the words came out liquor-soaked: garbled, slow, and soft.

She twitched, startled, dropping her keys to the floor. The woman placed a trembling hand to her chest and turned to face me.

*“Heavens. Don’t you have better places to be, young lady?”*

I bent down, picked up her keys, and handed them over.

*“Sorry. The detective who works down the hall, have you seen him? Is he still here?”*

She cocked her head.

*“Ambrose?”* I clarified.

The woman shrugged. Her lips tightened into a narrow line. She returned to locking her office, the key finally clicking into place. When she pivoted back to me, her expression was scornful, irritated, but her indignation seemed to melt away upon getting a good look at my sorry state - body drunk, mind breaking.

*“Honey…is there someone I can call for you? Are you lost? Do you need help?”* she purred.

*“What? No. No, I had a meeting with a detective, last door on the left, a little after eleven this morning, and I need” -* abruptly, I belched - “*I need to speak with him right away.”*

When she still appeared hopelessly confused, I turned and pointed to his office.

Her eyes darted from the room, to me, and then to her feet. She sighed, exasperated, and then began digging through her purse.

*“Where is the detective who works in* ***that goddamn*** *office?”* I asked, tone much angrier than I intended.

The woman retrieved her cell phone, dialed, and placed it against her ear.

*“I don’t know how you keep getting in here, but I’m calling you an ambulance.”*

I considered grabbing my lanyard and waving my ID in front of her face. Before I could, however, she said something that crushed me completely.

*“Because, honey, that room is a* [*storage closet.”*](https://www.reddit.com/r/unalloyedsainttrina/comments/1j88zl3/welcome_to_a_very_chaotic_horror_subredditupdated/)",4,1759252431.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

Sometimes I wonder if karma’s just watching me like, “Remember that one time in 2009 when you didn’t share your chips? Yeah, I’m still on that.”

And the worst part? You can’t even rage-quit. There’s no log-out button. Just another Monday, another heartbreak, another ""haha I’m fine"" typed through tears.

At this point, I don’t want to be successful. I just want to wake up one day and not feel like I’m being hunted by the universe’s sense of humor. And u asking me to find happiness in little things like broo i still in search of even a microscopic minute reason to be happy about .. All i laugh about is my how far worse things can happen to me :)

Can we escape all of it ?? Nope coz that was never the option .......

Well i am not complaining but sometimes it just comes out of nowhere :))))))",1,1759252339.0,u_Famous-Pick3265,0,1.0,False

Three deaths.

One after the other, each separated by exactly one week’s time, and the circumstances were bafflingly similar. Nearly identical, actually.

Each victim lived alone.

Each victim died in the same manner.

And each victim left the same note.

One thing was certain: the deaths were not natural. That left foul play or suicide, but, according to Detective Ambrose, neither explanation really made much sense. That didn’t stop people from developing an opinion, though.

The conundrum left the department precariously split: half the bullpen thought murder, the other half thought suicide. Tensions were mounting. The hung jury was getting restless. Historically even-keeled officers were instigating screaming matches over the topic. They needed a tiebreaker: information that could put the mystery to bed. For the victims, sure, but also for the department’s sanity.

That’s where I came in, he said.

The detective paused.

*“Come on in and sit down whenever the mood suits you, I suppose,”* he grumbled.

I guess it was wishful thinking to believe he’d let me listen to the entire briefing from the safety of the doorway.

From where I stood, his office looked like a war zone.

Stacks of overstuffed boxes rose high against every available inch of wall, jaundice-colored documents leaking from soggy cracks and bulging lids. A lone bulb, dangling from exposed wires that snaked up into the ceiling, cast the room in a meager glow. There *technically* was an available chair - a rickety, dangerous-looking thing, its cracked seat sloping leftward because of its uneven, rust-covered legs - but I’d have to move carefully through the dimly lit space to reach it.

*“Yeah, of course,”* I replied. Reluctantly, I tiptoed inside.

A faint fungal aroma lingered in the air, stale and tangy, like a cup of stagnant orange juice bristling with hungry mold. Stray documents lurked on the floor, some visible, others concealed within a thin layer of darkness where the light couldn’t reach. Slipped more than once, but thankfully, I did not fall. After a minute of tedious navigation, I planted myself down wordlessly, cautious not to clip the empty coffee cups lining the edge of his desk with my bag.

*“Sorry about the mess - my actual office is currently being renovated.”*

I nodded and shot him a weak, sympathetic smile, though I couldn’t help but wonder if this particular civil servant was on a red-eye flight to the unemployment line.

Felt like I’d met every agent in my decades of freelance work, but I hadn’t met Ambrose. Judging from the state of his “office” - the downright cataclysmic levels of disarray - there may have been a good reason for that. The man was no spring chicken, either. Wrinkles, liver spots, and a pair of cataract-stricken eyes combined to form something akin to a face below a mop of frizzy white hair.

Not that I was really in a position to criticize. My apartment was just as bad, if not worse, and I’d recently found myself on the wrong side of my late forties.

I eased into that deathtrap of a chair. For a moment, he just stared at me, elbows resting on the desk, hands clasped. The bulb flickered. He disappeared and then reappeared from the resulting blackness, but he did not move, nor did he blink.

*“…so, you'd like me to weigh in on the notes?”* I asked.

*“Ah, yes!”* he squealed. Ambrose visibly winced at his own reaction. His cheeks became flushed. He coughed vigorously, as if clearing phlegm, which only reddened his cheeks further.

*“Yes, yes...the notes...”* he reiterated in a deeper voice.

The detective tore three sheets from a nearby file.

*“Here’s the rub, Vivian: as far as we can tell, these victims never interacted with each other; not in any meaningful way, and yet, they all left one of these behind in their wake.”*

He handed me three black-and-white photographs, each centered on three differently shaped scraps of paper, each featuring the same five words:

***“Thread’s loose. Be back soon.”***

And just like that, in spite of his strangeness, he had my undivided attention. Wild curiosity coiled around my heart: a python twisting about weakened prey, almost ready to squeeze.

*“Now, if you buy the bullshit theory that these three killed themselves, I guess you could call them ‘suicide notes,’”* the detective continued, revealing his take on the “murder vs. suicide” controversy.

As he spoke, I fanned the pictures out. Compared them side-by-side.

*“I don’t call them suicide notes, though, ‘cause they don’t read like dying words to me; more like a strange calling card, the pretentious droppings of some knock-off, store-brand Zodiac Killer, getting a hard-on imagining us scratching our heads over their grand cipher.”*

The letters had…embellishments. Ornamentations. Flourishes as artistic as they were enigmatic.

In my twenty years of forensic document examination, I hadn’t ever seen anything like it.

There was a crescentic curl spinning clockwise off the bottom of the “T”. The “d” harbored three crisp, horizontal dots within its confines. The capital “B” had an extra bowl stacked on top of the normal two, looking like a pair of brass knuckles modified to fit a three-fingered mafioso. Each note’s handwriting was distinct, yes, but the flourishes? They appeared eerily identical.

*“No signs of forced entry at any of the crime scenes, no fingerprints on the murder weapons, and the handwriting seems to match each victim, at least to our untrained eyes.”*

He yanked the photos away and slid them into a manila folder. I struggled against the impulse to pull them back.

*“So - you’ll need to tell us if the notes are forgeries. If they are, that suggests one person wrote all three, which suggests murder. If they aren’t, I suppose they must have been suicides.”*

An impish smirk slithered across his face.

*“Can’t be both, right?”*

*“Not in my experience, no,”* I replied bluntly, a little exhausted by the man’s loopy behavior.

After a few more minutes of talking shop, the briefing concluded. I stood up and reached across the desk, offering the detective my hand. He did not shake it. No, the man just examined it.

Ambrose looked it over closely, like I was handing him a kitchen knife blade first and he was unsure of a safe place to grasp it. Eventually, I allowed my palm a tactical retreat, shoving the spurned digits into my pants pocket and turning to stumble my way out of the office.

Before officially departing, I realized I was missing some crucial information.

*“Remind me - how did they die?”* I asked from the doorway.

He closed his eyes, leaned back, and scratched his chin.

*“I think that’s out of your scope, Vivian,”* he muttered.

My pulse quickened. I felt the hard, gritty friction of grinding teeth and the boiling unease of growing rage.

*“Sir - Detective Ambrose - with all due respect, I’ve worked hand-in-hand with your department for decades. It hasn’t always been a perfectly amicable relationship, but not once has a detective outright refused to give me pertinent information.”*

***“That’s out of your scope, Vivian.*****”** He repeated himself, but much louder, over-enunciating each syllable, giving the statement an almost concussive quality - a series of rapid punches aimed at my torso. Despite the shouting, that impish smirk never left his face. He bellowed straight through the smile like it wasn’t even there.

The outburst left me slack-jawed. My head swiveled, peering down the hall, looking for someone to act as an impromptu referee for this bizarre interaction, to no avail. Ambrose’s office was in the station’s sublevel. Foot traffic was minimal.

When I looked back, he was *waving* at me. A stiff and exaggerated *bon voyage* that frightened me more than the shouting. It feels absurd to label the man an amateur at waving, but it truly looked like he was reenacting something he’d seen in a commercial once, rather than a normal, human gesture.

*“Thanks! This was fun. Bye now. My cell number should be in the file; let me know if you need anything!”* he boomed, visage strobing from the bulb flickering on and off.

My blood cooled. My rage wilted. I jogged off without responding, manila folder of documents tightly in hand. Knowing I had some work to sink my teeth into when I got home was the sole saving grace of the whole damn ordeal.

I paced towards the elevator. My eyes kept darting over my shoulder, half expecting to catch Ambrose in hot pursuit. He never was. Instead, I saw an elderly woman with thick bottle-cap glasses and a warm grin exiting one of the other offices. She implored me to hold the elevator as she shuffled rigidly across the sublevel’s tile flooring, so I stuck my hand over the sensor. The woman entered, thanked me, and we were finally on our way.

As I flung my car door shut, I wanted nothing more than to brush it off. Unfortunately, mental rumination is my god given talent. If dwelling were a sport, I’d be an Olympian. If perseveration could be monetized, I would have retired in the 80s a billionaire.

I couldn’t help myself.

For what felt like the fortieth time, I replayed his robotic, almost child-like wave in my head, trying - and failing - to discern *why* any self-respecting adult man would do such a thing. As the replays crested into the triple digits, a nagging detail started bubbling to the surface.

I saw something on his palm as he waved me off. Faded mounds of puckered skin organized into a very specific shape: a scar. The type of scar you don’t acquire by accident.

An equilateral triangle, point down, with two diagonal lines continuing beyond the point. Where one of them stopped, the other kinked at a ninety-degree angle and kept going, but only for a little longer. It resembled an hourglass with the bottom falling out like a trapdoor, or an “X” with the top covered and a small tail.

As I peeled down the interstate, speed steadily increasing, I couldn’t get the symbol out of my mind.

Did I imagine the detail?

Was it just a weird trick of the light, shadows dancing across his palm in such a way that it gave the impression of something that wasn’t actually there?

If the scar *was* real, then what the hell did it mean?

My attention drifted from the vacant highway to a passing billboard for only a fraction of a second. When my attention shifted back, I felt my heart detonate against the back of my throat.

There was a rapidly approaching bumper. I slammed on the brakes. The sharp chemical odor of burning rubber invaded my nostrils. I braced for impact.

My sedan thudded to a painful, suspension-destroying stop at what felt like the last possible second. The very tip of my car clinked gingerly against their license plate. Don’t think the driver even looked up from their phone.

The war drum beating in my chest slowed, and slowed, and slowed, and then I finally let myself breathe.

Gridlock was unusual for the early afternoon, but I had a sneaking suspicion as to the reason behind it. I grabbed a half-empty pack of Newports from the cupholder, stuck a cigarette between my still-trembling lips, and rolled down the window. Damp summer air coated my exposed skin. I felt my forearm stick to the hot plastic as I pulled my head out to get a better view of the holdup.

There was a plume of smoke in the distance, maybe a quarter mile ahead of the traffic. No nearby construction signage, either. As I lowered myself back into the car, my mouth was dry and my mind was racing. They’d been happening more and more recently. If I saw two on the way to the grocery store, and three on my way home, that’d be under the average. A good day, all things considered.

In the past year, the number of car accidents that occurred across my fair city had skyrocketed.

Most were mild. Fender-benders. Distracted drivers who poorly estimated how fast a car was going, or how far away they were. Some were more serious. A small proportion resulted in fatalities, and, if the press was to be believed, an even smaller proportion of the collisions were both tragically fatal *and* alarmingly inexplicable.

Inexplicable how? Well, it was tough to say. Local journalists waltzed elegantly around the details, hinting at *some* unexplainable aspect of the wrecks while diligently reporting the carnage.

I remember the title of one article read:

*“In a crash that has police puzzled, totaled SUV discovered around small bus. 15 killed. Only surviving victim remains comatose and unable to provide further details.”*

I’m sorry - the SUV was *around* the bus? How exactly would that work?

Mechanistically, what possible circumstances could have led to that outcome?

The article itself focused exclusively on memorializing the victims, which, although admirable, left us layfolk more than a little confused.

Pictures of the dead before the crash? Yes.

Pictures of the crash itself? Conspicuously absent.

Many DUI checkpoints and anti-texting-while-driving initiatives later, nothing much had changed. The crashes were only becoming more frequent as time went on.

Suffice it to say, I experienced a gnawing dread about what might lie beneath the plume of smoke.

Speaking of smoke, the cancer stick did wonders massaging my frayed nerves into a state of tenuous relaxation. I inched through the traffic without succumbing to a panic attack. Half an hour later, I was scooting by the crash itself, though I had a hard time comprehending what I was looking at.

I lit another cigarette.

There was just a heap of tangled metal. A ball of harsh silvery edges shimmering in the midday sun, seemingly closer to what would come out of a car blender than a collision on the interstate.

Where did the first vehicle start and the other vehicle end?

Were there more than two in that unintelligible mess?

And, most chillingly, what chance did *anyone* have to survive such a crash?

My eyes traced various lines of coherent metal as they dipped in and out of the shattered steel nucleus, figuring that if I could wrap my head around its interlocking knots and snarls, then I could mentally wring it all out. Unravel the crash like a length of twisted yarn until, inevitably, I was left with the cars that created it, each full and perfect. From there, I’d finally understand how it happened.

I thought if I could understand it, then I’d be safe.

The sound of a blaring horn behind me ruptured my trance. Unconsciously, I had come to a complete stop at the crux of the bottleneck. I pressed my foot on the gas and sped forward, trying to focus on the drive home, trying to stay in the moment, trying not to ruminate on something I didn’t understand for once in my life and just move on.

Surprisingly, I was successful; I didn’t dwell on the crash, but only because another incomprehensible image seemed more pressing.

An “X” covered at the top with a small tail.

An hourglass with an open trapdoor at the bottom.

One that I felt myself falling through, dropping deeper with each passing second.

\- - - - -

The stench pummeled my body like an avalanche.

My apartment never smelled good - not in the years I’d lived there - but that evening, the odor was uniquely abrasive. Sulfurous, sour, and sweet. A scent that landed somewhere between spoiled tofu and an oozing septic tank.

I slammed the door shut and threw my bag onto the kitchen island. Plastic sushi trays containing petrified ores of unused wasabi clattered to the floor, making room. I held my breath, surveying the kitchen, assessing for the source. There was a bevy of potential culprits: the partially eaten microwave dinners covering the countertops, whatever prehistoric takeout skulked in the darkest corners of my fridge, the once verdant spider plant that was beginning to show signs of rot, et cetera, et cetera.

Ultimately, I’d need to breathe deep if I wanted to locate the proverbial needle in the haystack.

I didn’t have to search very hard. With willing nostrils, the putrid odor promptly escorted me to a small crevice between my workbench and the nearby wall, where a discarded box of half-eaten lo mien laid in wait, hidden for God knows how long. I delivered the biohazard to my building’s trash chute immediately, holding it by the tip of a sodden white fold like it was the tail of a long-dead rat.

Crisis averted.

When I returned, the apartment still smelled, but it was its familiar, baseline reek, and I found that to be acceptable.

I wasn’t always so grubby.

As a kid, my bedroom sparkled. I could manage the responsibility because my internal fixations were incredibly narrow, practically pinpointed. If I kept my room immaculate and got perfect grades, I was good, I was safe.

Age, to my chagrin, introduced an infinite-feeling rogues’ gallery of additional topics to helplessly fixate on: romance, politics, existential terror, climate change, mortality, morality, drugs, STDs, taxes, real estate, sex, desire, prestige, heart attacks, dementia, on, and on, and on, like gas expanding against the seams of my skull, threatening to break it wide open, splattering my precious neural jelly all over my socially adjusted peers, staining their nice, white clothes a visceral red-blue.

My twenties were rough.

For a while, I simply existed. Not alive. Not dead. Paralyzed through and through.

The pursuit of inner peace led me to group meditation, but I couldn’t just sit; I needed something that cleared my mind but kept my body moving. A friend recommended calligraphy. I tried it, and for the first time in my life, I tasted harmony. I found something I could get lost in, something that released the pressure in my skull.

From there, I made the mysterious beauty of written language a career.

With the stench tackled, I settled at my workbench. The space was tidy. The oak gleamed. The overhead lights had freshly replaced bulbs, and the lens of my standing magnifying glass was clear and dustless.

I opened the manila folder, flicked the lights on, spread the documents across the oak, and lost myself.

But only for a little while.

***“Thread’s Loose. Be back soon.”***

I figured I’d tackle the notes one by one, comparing their handwriting to older samples provided by Detective Ambrose. Before I could start, however, something caught my eye. A subtle discrepancy between the notes that I hadn’t detected on a cursory examination.

The strange, captivating embellishments weren’t *completely* identical, as I first thought. One flourish differed.

There was a small dash coming off the last letter, the “n”. That was true for each note. However, the dashes weren’t all going in the same direction.

One moved up at an angle, one was straight, and one went down at an angle.

Suddenly, the writing felt magnetic. I couldn’t peel myself away. My eyes refused to blink, galvanized to the lettering. My attention made a cyclic pilgrimage from one note to the next, studying the variation with reverence and awe.

Up, across, down.

I started hearing something I didn’t recognize. A noise that didn’t belong in my apartment. A noise that didn’t belong *anywhere*.

Up, across, down.

A quiet, lawless tapping. A thousand fingernails clicking against marble - manic, hungry, forlorn.

Up, across, down.

The anarchic noise got louder. A riot filled my ears, no room for anything else. The sound was like a chest-high wave of centipedes was advancing towards me, tethered hides futilely knocking into each other as they desperately tried to untangle themselves, tapping, tapping, tapping.

Up, across, down.

The embellishments developed depth.

The photograph cracked and splintered like expanding ice.

The letters unzipped.

If squinted, if I positioned my head *just* right, I could spy something between the cracks.

The hideous tapping reached a fever pitch.

Then, there was knocking at my door.

*“Viv! Viv, you home?”* a muffled voice asked.

I leapt back, my chair clattering behind me, my heartbeat thumping and rabid.

When I looked to the door, the tapping faded.

*“Jesus, Viv, you okay in there?”*

Wobbling, blurry vision wading through tides of vertigo, I moved to open the door. The deadbolt clicked and I cracked the door, just enough to show that I was indeed alive. Maggie had an itchy trigger finger when it came to phoning emergency services.

She was an empathetic friend and an accommodating next-door neighbor, but the sixty-something ex-beatnik was also a hell of a snoop. Wasn’t uncommon to see her striding up and down our floor, ears perked, patrolling for even the faintest wisps of gossip. Retirement had left her with nothing better to do. So even though her expression betrayed concern, there was an undeniable glint of curiosity swelling behind her eyes.

I ran a quivering hand through my hair, pulling strands slick with sweat from my face.

*“Yeah, Mags, I’m good, just working,”* I muttered.

Maggie shot me a sideways glance, penciled brows arched.

*“Right.”* she replied flatly. I shrugged, fighting the urge to push the door closed.

Her features softened, curiosity snuffed out, a parish of worry lines congregating along her forehead.

*“Sweetheart, I know you’re a bloodhound with your work - God bless and keep you - but I don’t think you know when to stop.”* She lifted a bottle of cheap, nutmeg-colored whiskey into view. *“Moreover, I have news about Mr. Peterson, and it’s ghastly, absolutely fucking harrowing. Care for a break?”*

I shifted nervously in the doorway, still rattled from what I’d just experienced, but wanting nothing more than to return to my workbench at the same time.

*“Sorry - I didn’t mean to phrase that like a question, because it ain’t. Get on out here, Viv.”*

A delicate smile crept across my face. I relented.

*“Ugh, fine. I’ll meet you on the roof in five. Gotta clean up in here.”*

Maggie sniffed cartoonishly, well aware of the man-made disaster that was my apartment.

*“You’ll be able to do that in five minutes?”*

My smile bloomed.

*“Nice one, Mags, real clever.”*

I shut the door.

To relax, I needed to tidy my workbench first. Figured I’d collect the documents into a neat pile, pull the chair upright, and then I’d be ready; I could attend to the notes at another time. There was no rush, and I was clearly a little out of sorts.

I almost convinced myself that what I experienced was just the hallucinogenic vacillations of an overburdened mind. A sort of cognitive spasm that was downstream of the detective’s unsettling behavior, the horrific collision, or low blood sugar - most likely some ungodly combination of all three.

But then I scanned the room.

I blinked.

I blinked again.

When that didn’t remedy the problem, I rubbed my eyes so strenuously that my vision temporarily blurred. Nothing changed.

My rolling chair was just…gone.

Wasn’t tipped over on my stain-riddled carpet, like it should’ve been.

I checked my bedroom: no chair.

I checked my bathroom: no chair.

I checked my single, multi-purpose closet: unless it’d somehow become buried deep within the mountain of microwave dinner boxes and old clothes, it wasn’t there either.

For a brief moment, my gaze flirted with the photographs still lurking atop my workbench. A gentle flurry of distant taps resonated against my eardrums, beckoning me.

I ripped myself away. Forced my eyes closed.

The sound promptly dissipated.

Pacing out of my apartment, I locked the door behind me and headed up to the roof, leaving my workbench cluttered for the first and last time.

\- - - - -

The roof was our sanctuary, our private serenity sequestered fifteen stories above the maddening bustle of the city. We’d made weekly visits to that place for as long as we’d been friends: eight and a half years, give or take. Pretty sure the landlord didn’t know about our trips, either.

Maggie was strangely proficient with a lock pick.

From the relative comfort of her two raggedy beach chairs, we watched the sun curve through the atmosphere, drenching the sky in its liquid gold. The bottom-shelf whiskey laminated my throat with the pleasant burn of a campfire. Intoxication coaxed out an edited recollection of my day, and it felt damn good. I smoothed out the stranger details, of course. She didn’t need to know about the unusual symbol or the frenetic tapping, but I did mention the vanishing chair.

*“I’m sure you’ll find it.""* Maggie reassured me. ""*You know, something like that happened to me recently. Something outlandish.”*

She passed the bottle, and I took another generous swig.

*“Tell me.”* I rasped, the taste of turpentine still crackling over my tongue.

*“Well…”*

Maggie paused; an uncharacteristic lapse in momentum. She was never one to mince words. The chair screeched against the rough concrete as she turned it to face me. Her frost-tinted eyes locked onto mine.

*“So, I was cutting a pizza the other day,”* she started.

*“As one does.”* I slurred.

*“Hush, child. Listen.”*

I placed the bottle on the concrete, sat up straight, and saluted her.

*“Yes, ma’am. Right away, ma’am.”*

She rolled her eyes.

*“Anyway, I’m cutting a pizza, and I make two cuts. To be clear, I’m sure I made two cuts: one vertical, one left to right. Separated it into four equal slices, same way I always do.”*

I nodded, curious about the anecdote’s punchline.

*“But, when I looked…”* she trailed off. Another pause. Maggie grabbed the bottle by the neck, and imbibed. One, two, three gulps for courage. Then she started again.

*“When I looked, there were only three pieces.”*

A sputtering chuckle erupted from my lips.

*“What? Mags, what the hell are you talking about? What do you mean, ‘there were only three pieces’?”*

Her face began to flush, and she looked away. Instant regret soured some of the whiskey sloshing around my gut.

She furiously gesticulated cutting a pizza in the air and repeated herself.

*“I put two equal cuts into the pizza, in the shape of a plus, like I’ve been doing since the day I was old enough to work an oven, and, somehow, I was left with three slices. How the fuck does that happen? Doesn’t make a lick of sense.”*

Her words came out sharp, as if it was painful to say any of it out loud. I reached over and rubbed her shoulder.

*“Hey - no worse than losing a chair. I think we’re both getting senile, you old bat. Like, you haven’t even told me the ‘ghastly’ news about Mr. Peterson, and that’s the gossip you led with…”*

Maggie sprang from her beach chair.

*“Oh my fucking god! Yes! I can’t believe I forgot. I mean, I’m glad I forgot for a little; shit was ghastly. Ain’t really gossip, either.”*

She began pacing in small, hectic circles.

*“So, I was doing my rounds - wandering from boredom - and I reached Mr. Peterson’s room, all the way on the opposite end of the hall. I rarely go that far, suppose I was particularly stir-crazy yesterday. You know him, right?”*

I nodded. He was a crotchety old man who owned the nearby laundromat. I’d suffered plenty of awkward elevator rides with him over the years. Small talk with the curmudgeon was basically impossible. Far as I could tell, we had only two things in common: we were both unmarried, and we both rented apartments at the very edge of our exceptionally wide complex.

*“I got to his door, and there was…a smell. A terrible, rotting smell, like roadkill. And…I don’t know, I feared the worst, so I knocked. No response, but the door creaked open a smidge. Needless to say, I was the person who found him. By the looks of it, he’d been dead a while.”*

*“Oh, Jesus…”* I whispered.

*“Viv - trust me, it gets much, much worse.”*

My pulse quickened.

*“He…he was naked, sprawled out on the floor. No head. No arms - well, no attached arms. Half his right leg removed at the knee.”*

She sighed, interrupted her frantic pacing, and peered up at the sky, as if she were beseeching God for a reasonable explanation to what she had witnessed.

*“His arms were folded over his chest, laid parallel to his shoulders so that his neck stump and his jagged arm knubs were all clustered together, elbows bent so his hands were covering his belly button. And…and his left leg - the one that was still sort of intact - they twisted it counterclockwise until the kneecap pointed away from the body. Bent that leg too, just like the arms: same forty-five degree angle. Oh! And they fuckin’ painted them, too, just the arms and the legs. Bright, bleedin’ red, all the way around. Made what was left of him look like some weird, fucked hieroglyphic.”*

Breath fled my lungs. My brain sizzled, cooking itself delirious.

A vision of the detective’s scar took form in my consciousness.

And I thought I could hear the tapping.

But it could’ve just been a memory.

I choked out seven small words: *“The shape…kind of…like an hourglass?”*

Maggie thought about it for a second. She seemed to register my simmering panic.

*“Uh…well, yeah, sort of.”*

*“And you’re sure he wasn’t newly dead?”*

*“Yes, Viv - I’m sure. Don’t plan on cursing you with those grisly details, but he’d clearly been dead a while. The officer I spoke with thought just as much when they came to pick him - his body - up.”*

My stomach lurched. I felt it vibrating like a harshly plucked string, fluttering violently against my abdominal muscles.

*“Was there…was there a note?”*

She forced a weak laugh.

*“What, like some last words? From Mr. Peterson, or his killer? Love, I have no fucking idea, and I didn’t walk in to find out - last I checked, I’m not a CSI.”*

I rocketed from my beach chair, knocking over the whiskey bottle in my turbulent haste.

*“Vivian, sweetheart - please, tell me what’s happening…”* she pleaded.

Without another word, I sprinted away, hyperventilating, tripping over my own feet.

Maggie called out after me, but I didn’t look back.

I tried to call Ambrose at the number he’d provided. When he didn’t pick up, I ordered an Uber.

If luck was on my side, the department would still be open.

\- - - - -

The elevator chimed. The doors crept apart to reveal the sublevel. I lumbered down the musty hallway.

Desperate rationalizations sprouted from my ailing psyche, more and more every second.

*Ambrose misspoke. Got the dates mixed up or something.*

*Maybe I misheard him. I could have misheard him.*

*Maggie was mistaken - Mr. Peterson had to have died yesterday.*

But the police just *learned* of him yesterday. Maggie’s no idiot, either. Doubt she’d confuse new death for prolonged decomposition. And nothing could explain the state of the body matching the scar on Ambrose’s palm.

I stumbled. The walls seemed to shudder as my body made contact. I stifled a shriek and pushed myself off the shivering plaster.

Had to keep moving, had to keep going.

The light in his cramped office was still on, still flickering, but Ambrose wasn't there.

Just then, the woman I’d held the elevator door for a few hours earlier stepped out of her office. I jogged up to her as she fumbled with a keyring.

*“Excuse me, excuse me -”* to my embarrassment, the words came out liquor-soaked: garbled, slow, and soft.

She twitched, startled, dropping her keys to the floor. The woman placed a trembling hand to her chest and turned to face me.

*“Heavens. Don’t you have better places to be, young lady?”*

I bent down, picked up her keys, and handed them over.

*“Sorry. The detective who works down the hall, have you seen him? Is he still here?”*

She cocked her head.

*“Ambrose?”* I clarified.

The woman shrugged. Her lips tightened into a narrow line. She returned to locking her office, the key finally clicking into place. When she pivoted back to me, her expression was scornful, irritated, but her indignation seemed to melt away upon getting a good look at my sorry state - body drunk, mind breaking.

*“Honey…is there someone I can call for you? Are you lost? Do you need help?”* she purred.

*“What? No. No, I had a meeting with a detective, last door on the left, a little after eleven this morning, and I need” -* abruptly, I belched - “*I need to speak with him right away.”*

When she still appeared hopelessly confused, I turned and pointed to his office.

Her eyes darted from the room, to me, and then to her feet. She sighed, exasperated, and then began digging through her purse.

*“Where is the detective who works in* ***that goddamn*** *office?”* I asked, tone much angrier than I intended.

The woman retrieved her cell phone, dialed, and placed it against her ear.

*“I don’t know how you keep getting in here, but I’m calling you an ambulance.”*

I considered grabbing my lanyard and waving my ID in front of her face. Before I could, however, she said something that crushed me completely.

I thought we would just do coffee but we ended up spending 8 hours together, having dinner and talking by the river until nearly 12am. No physical touch or anything, just non stop talking, which was nice. He said let’s meet again after I come back from my trip so I got the impression it was a good sign.

But I could tell he is not the most expressive (talkative but no compliments). But he remembered many things about me and asked when I came back from my trip. Overall, I had a good time and after we parted ways, we kept texting. I think it’s a good sign?

I actually built the site a couple years ago because there was a beer site I liked (RateBeer) and wanted to approximate for specialty coffee. I semi-launched it and then got really busy, and am getting back to it now, and have improved a few things.  The nice thing is I've been using the platform myself along with a few others and the data is starting to fill in and I feel good about the top recommendations at least.

You can check it out here: [https://coffeeroast.com](https://coffeeroast.com), and if you try it out, I'd be happy to try out your site/project and provide feedback.

Only having coffees & water to sustain me (as if it ever did) then I’ll eat dinner with my family since they’re strict about it. Then my evening would involve eating what I want and essentially binging. Then I would purge and go to sleep… and then repeat.

I remember having maybe one or two weeks where I was able to count calories and restrict, and also my honeymoon phase where I was able liquid fast for the month. I’m trying to recover and I’ve been good with not purging (lol just purged before making this post.. anyway) I want to lose weight in a healthier way. I tried to count calories this past week and regardless of how embarrassing it was with my family walking in & out I still did it. But I still had a day or two where I went above my limit and that b/p mentality kicked in.

Does anyone know how to lose weight properly? I’m honestly so sick & tired of purging. I have days where I don’t think about it and think I’m “recovered” but unfortunately I’ve learnt it’s something that is always at the back of my head and I have to work around it.

I had only known them for a few months. At first it was fine, but things started going downhill after one comment.

One of the guys, let’s call him *Eric*, made a remark that I must be liberal “because of my dad,” even though I had already said I didn’t want to discuss politics. I told him I didn’t appreciate being boxed in like that and that an apology would suffice. Instead of apologizing, he doubled down. He insisted he doesn’t like texting and only wanted to “talk in person like reasonable men,” but whenever I asked him directly if he would apologize, he avoided answering and started framing me as “threatening” just for setting expectations.

I never insulted him back, but he repeatedly got dismissive and arrogant over text. Eventually we met in person where I bought him a Starbucks coffee, and instead of resolving it, he blew up, insulted me multiple times, and said the friendship was over. He told me to get up and hug him to which I declined but extended my hand for him to shake. I told him I wasn’t interested in being treated that way in text after he left. After that, I completely stopped going to his church and cut contact with the group.

Here’s where it gets weird. Even after 9 months of no contact, I’ve been stalked/harassed with random texts from anonymous numbers. It’s the exact same thing that used to happen to me in high school when I was bullied, which I had confided to this group earlier. I strongly suspect it’s them repeating the same pattern to get under my skin.

At the same time, they’re still watching me online. I work at a bank and recently won a case competition and got selected for a new role, which I posted about on LinkedIn. One of the guys from the group (*Alex*) likes all my posts and texts me every couple of months, inviting me out. I always respond cordially but never follow up. The rest of the group stay connected to me on LinkedIn but never like or comment on anything. It feels like they’re silently watching but refusing to acknowledge me, while one person keeps a line open.

From my perspective, I addressed the initial insult calmly and directly, never insulted anyone back, and walked away when it turned toxic. I’ve focused on my work and school since. But part of me wonders if I was wrong for cutting them all off after what started as “just” a political comment.

So, AITA for walking away from this group and staying no-contact, even though they still find ways to harass me or lurk?",5,1759251954.0,AITAH,19,0.86,False

This is my last posts though, this is my last attempt/try.","You can be worldwide, that is fine. While I'm looking for something serious with awesome/cool vibes I'm in no rush to start dating tomorrow, haha.

I know this might be hard to find a partner, but I'm looking for someone that doesn't need photographs of their partner to be constantly happy, I'm unable to understand how photographs and selfie exchanges make a relationship grow between one another. I don't even know how this makes a bond or a connection and I'll never be able to understand even if this is explained by my partner, I've had ex-partners trying to explain that connections are stronger if physical exchanges of photographs are exchanged frequently. I'm not that type of person. I'm sorry. I should also let the Redditor know reading this, that I'm a Redditor that is seeking online only currently at this time for personal reasons.

I've explained on my post in more detail of what kind of online activities I like to do together already on previous posts from earlier. 

Skyrim updates. 

The only reason why I joined Dawnguard was because I don't know what was up with my game, but who doesn't on a not modded Skyrim game. You never know what kind of problems you're going to run into in Skyrim with the hilarious and funny gltiches. However this seemed interesting for me and I don't even know why that kept on happening to me at a very high chance rate, but almost 70 percent of the time I would fast travel the vampires would be after me constantly and I was annoyed.What even got worse was a few vampires ruined some NPC quest I wanted to complete, so I'm taking my vengeance out on them for their annoyance, haha. However, this gave me the chance to see if I enjoyed the crossbow anyways, because when I played Skyrim on a console I don't have anymore and obviously the save file is gone.  My favorite style was/were blocking and using the Mace of Molag Bal. However, using a crossbow is very deadly and surprisingly I'm very good at using a crossbow. Back when I played Skyrim on the console that I used to know, I just had the basic copy of Skyrim, nothing fancy and no special edition. However, that is different now since I play on the PS4 I'm also a Stormcloak obviously, because I can't stand annoying politics where there is a bunch of NPCS talking about high praise for the Imperials and it's just getting me to think ''you're about as annoying as Nazeem every single time I go to Whiterun.'' I've never seen an NPC be as annoying as a Stormcloak though. 

I want to see how much I can handicap myself this time around without using double enchantments on my gear but a single enchantment on my gear and I also will not be using any elemental protection to further handicap me, haha. I'm also on adept because I think that's all the stress level I want to give myself, while mildly handicapping myself on the game and I don't think I want to change the combat level difficulty.

I simply and truthfully think the only way I'm going to survive a Falmer cave is if I've tank with me in block, heavy gear and archery to back me up. This is going to create a very stressful environment, however I never handicapped myself like this on Skyrim as I've always done double enchantments on gear and jewelry. I never did a no elemental protection on gear before and I never did a 1 enchantment handicap on my gear and jewelry. 

Closing this post.

I will not be here Friday and I will be gone for a while, until then my chat request are open for now and I've provided on my social link on my profile where you can message me outside of Reddit. I don't respond to comments asking me to ''message them.'' because I don't know what or why you would want me to message you about, instead that would be easier if you sent me a chat request that is something more based on something you liked on this posts, something on my Reddit profile and comments.

About the Discord server again from previous posts. 


I just wanted to make an updated post about the Discord server. I will be online on Reddit with my chat request open till Friday, and then I'm going to go away for a while.

However, I thought I would share some updates since my last post that I deleted, and I thought I should address some new updates about myself and the Discord server.

Here is the Discord server invite link; however, this link doesn't need to be clicked right away because you're interested right away. You should check the first pinned posts for a further explanation of the Discord server's rules than what the Disboard social link can provide on my Reddit profile. 

https://discord.com/invite/ZQNkZaHeps

https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwLIg-7ZIdT4WaAAD4629BXLVXrJQG5tf

You just might think, ""You really think this Discord server is okay for people with social anxiety with 60 people in the Discord server"" (I'm sure the Discord server will either rise or decrease when I say this, haha.) However, what makes you think 60 people in the Discord server are chatting up a storm? That's so inaccurately false, haha. 

Yeah, well, this Discord server is heavily music-based, which means people with social anxiety will only check the notifications for the hashtags that are related to the music hashtags and will only text in the general text when the energy/vibes are right. Which is what is happening in the Discord server; nobody barely texts in the general chat hashtags, and obviously that makes sense, it being a Discord server that is heavily catering to the NEETs, introverts, and people with social anxiety. 

That's how I am as well; I chat when I feel the energy, I'm feeling a break from the social anxiety, and I'm feeling chatty. I will say, speaking of social anxiety, introduction posts aren't required to chat/post amongst the Discord server members. However, if you feel the need to make an introduction post, then you can do that by doing what you normally post as an introduction post, as you would here on this subreddit.

Speaking of social anxiety, we're looking to help cure some of the sadness with cute cat pictures. Who here has cat pictures or cat videos that can help with the pet hashtag on the Discord server? If you don't have cats, then whatever pets you have or own work; that even includes if you have a pet gecko or salamander. You can also add to the spook factor if you get a lot of crows or ravens in your backyard for added vibes/coolness to the Discord server as well. I'm just trying to make this a non-toxic space for all and also trying to make friends that vibe with me. 

Which I should also state, while I understand that the format seems confusing when I say I'm looking for friendship and other connections? I just can't be honest if I can expose my heart to someone right now, right away, and I can't say that's off the table right now. I opened my heart this month actually, simply and truthfully honest with the Redditors reading this. I'm just not in the mood to open my heart again; I just want to be friends, and if the connection builds, then that's not off the table. I'm just being honest with the Redditors here.

I've other ideas that might work for the Discord server and for people's creative outlets. 

Examples could be.

Jerry handmade inspired bracelets but without using the Sleep Token logo! However, we do have safety measures for everyone to follow to feel safe. Redditors that join this Discord server for this purpose must be able to show proof either by a piece of paper of their PayPal and the item next to the item or, if the person doesn't have proof of reviews from a retail website where you can sell your goods, by the item itself.

An example of that would be eBay reviews. I'm also trying to see if I can have a friend help me with getting animated flamingo stickers for Sleep Token vibes, and I will have to see what can be done for Lorna Shore. I'm not certain what animated emotes can be used for Lorna Shore. Maybe someone could chime in with ideas!

I'm also allowing people in the introduction post to post if they feel comfortable posting about looking for people to play video games with. I know Discord automatically has a connection feature for Steam and PlayStation profiles, but that doesn't help others/give a cue to Discord users to know if you want people to play with you or not.

I also don't think Nintendo will be interested in allowing a Discord connection option, which sucks.

Who knows, maybe it's a copyright issue with Nintendo why there can't be a Discord connection option to share your Nintendo code for others to add; that's such a shame/bummer!

Which I wanted to bring up about gaming, since it's spooky season and Redditors are probably wondering. Since my last posts, it's obvious enough that I'm seeking an 85 percent connection and spent the majority of that time online only rather than in person because of personal conflicts with the living conditions that I'm in right now that will change in a year or possibly in two years, and you can read more in the second pinned post, as that would explain it in more detail than bringing this post out way longer than it is right now haha. However, let's talk about what I'm talking about with friends and doing something on the arrival of Halloween.

Obviously, microphones can be muted; of course, I will mute mine. I can tell you right now I can't multitask, as you've gathered from my previous posts that were previously deleted after being uploaded for a while. I can't multitask, and I get easily distracted if I try multitasking. I also don't think anybody wants to hear their friend go, 'Uh...wait, let me open a browser tab, and let me look this up, and oh wait, I need to go back on what my friend said. What was that?' 

Uh...then figures out what to say afterwards, while getting back on track, which is no thanks, and I don't expect anyone to get on the microphone anyways with social anxiety. 

However, I'm looking to see if a friend on Halloween could start a screen share on Discord or even start a YouTube stream with either a Silent Hill game or a Devil May Cry game, and as is obviously no surprise, my other favorite franchise is SEGA, and I mean, how obvious is that? It would be nice to sip on a coffee and text about whatever you feel like texting about, and we don't have to text about every single cutscene that hits the game unless you find that completely necessary. 

We don't really have to do that, and I don't find that necessary unless the other person thinks that's necessary. We can just get virtually cozy and text about whatever while I enjoy the stream, and yeah, we can both agree on a game that you would enjoy double screen sharing. 

We could even take a break, screen share on Discord my YT music shuffle playlist that I created, and just relax on Discord listening to music for an hour or longer than an hour, maybe an hour and a half, or maybe music/texting about whatever you feel like the topic should be for the evening/night. 

That would be fine, and also for game streams. I normally enjoy watching for three or four hours on screen share or YT stream, whereas music playlist shuffle screen sharing with my friends for an hour or near/close to an hour and a half is perfect because I end up dozing off and falling asleep because I'm so relaxed, LMFAO. My ex-friend/ex-partner did this with me until he didn't like doing that with me anymore, and yeah, we used to do this a lot, and this is something that almost happened once. I was so relaxed with the shuffle playlist stream/chatting away that I ended up getting very sleepy/tired and dozed off for a few minutes, haha.

The friends that I've curiously asked how autistic I sound in the past in text messages have always replied, ""You sound very autistic, and it's very noticeable in your text messages."" However, I do understand how mentally and emotionally draining it is for a non-neurodivergent to deal with someone very autistic, and you can read more on my pinned posts, but this is what happened to my ex-friend/ex-partner: he couldn't deal with my very autistic needs and partner. He thought he would be okay dating someone very autistic but found out a month later that this friendship/relationship was something he didn't want to continue doing. However, back on the energy drinks.

What my friend will do is go to the gas station and send me a picture of what energy drinks are at the gas station, and I select one. I'm a huge fan of Celsius even though SOME of their products taste nasty, and there are some Celsius products that taste cool/awesome though! Alani is another favorite of mine for energy drinks, and after we pick out energy drinks, we would either start screen sharing music or a video game for a while. I just think that's fun, and if you think this is weird or too strange. Well, I can't tell you how many times that my autistic self was/were way too overwhelming for people to deal with.

Which I should make a loud and clear statement here: just because there are 60 people in the Discord server (I don't look at the number often, so this could be inaccurate right now.) I only have about 8 contacts on my friend lists; that's because I don't and I will never individually message someone on the Discord server unless the person starts the conversation first, rather than from the posts the Redditor read on my posts or a comment the Redditor read on my profile. 

That's also what I imply when I state that, given that, I'm just chilling/vibing inside the Discord server, tending to the Discord server, occasionally texting with friends inside the Discord server (which is almost always Lorna Shore news and posting cat pictures or videos.) and seeing if anyone new messages me when joining the Discord server if there is an interest in friendship. I just wait for the friendship to come to me, as I'm getting tired of looking for friendship, and I'm finding that I'm getting that autistic burnout and feeling overstimulated by everything/needing a break. 

However, with that being stated, I hope people can feel safe and relaxed in a stress-free Discord server where the people that are very introverted and have social anxiety have a toxic-free place to be themselves/chat with others when the vibe/mood is right for their liking. With the hopes of the cute animal pictures/videos of pets, or whatever backyard birds are outside, if anyone has any memes that correspond to the Discord server, it could help someone crack a smile through the darkness, and then that is good enough for me, and I would feel a sense of relief/enjoyment within myself if that goal were to happen.

I don't know, yeah, how many people vibe with this; however, wouldn't it be cute as friends to match the Sleep Token sticker and Lorna Shore sticker on our phone cases? I think that is adorable/cute, simply and truthfully. I would hopefully one day/this could maybe and might happen to match a lot of Sleep Token and Lorna Shore stickers with my online friends; that would be cool/awesome.

However, I'm off to go play some Skyrim later again for a while. ",0,1759251722.0,NerdDating,0,0.5,False

I live alone for the first time (renter) and want my space to feel as perfectly me as possible, but I’m having trouble coordinating the colors/ decor in my living room especially. This  muted dark blue current couch is a hand-me-down that I’ll keep for a while longer (and maybe trade in for a newer light gray couch) but I think it’s what’s throwing me off in this room. I like a cozy, sort of boho style that makes you want to curl up, and I love color (jewel tones), as well as some slightly dark academia/goth elements. Think New England colonial fall. 

Anyway, I like the tv wall a lot, but it’s the opposite wall (couch) and the front door wall that I can’t get past. I want to have a pop of color where the olive green curtains are, because otherwise it’s all white. But that clashes with the hunter green wingback chair. And then I’ve got the muted dark blue couch, a black tv stand, neutral wood coffee table, and a gray tv stand. I’d like to decide on a loose color palette to guide me, because I’m overwhelmed at where to start. Does the olive green curtain and teal wall work? If so, what else should I change? Should I add another color to the olive green and teal palette? Last thing: since the tv wall is a gallery wall, what should I do with the wall above the couch—one giant piece of art instead of two?

The last time I was there someone parked near me and every time I looked over he would be staring at me. I got a drug dealer vibe from him. It is an area that has some drug activity. I started to worry that he might have thought I was a cop or someone moving in on his territory. Then a couple of days later near the same spot someone saw me pulling up and acted like they recognized me and came up to me asking if I had drugs.

I’ve been working on something I always wished existed: an [AI assistant for money](https://moneko.io/early-access). Instead of juggling spreadsheets or clunky apps, you can just *talk to it* like ChatGPT and it helps you stay on top of your finances.

Here’s what it can do (so far):

* **Chat to track expenses** — say *“I spent $25 on lunch”* or *“earned $500 freelancing”* and it logs it instantly
* **Smart budgeting** — automatically sorts transactions into categories so you can see where your money actually goes
* **Reminders** — get notified before bills are due and when paychecks are coming in
* **Goal tracking** — set targets (emergency fund, vacation, debt payoff), track your progress, and celebrate milestones

We’re building for **iPhone & iPad** first, so it’ll fit naturally into your daily flow.

Right now, the app is still in development (coming soon), but we’re opening up a **free lifetime access waitlist for the first 100 people**.

If you’re interested, just comment below and I’ll send you a promo code.

1nuinhq,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1nuinhq/flat_out_worn_out/,Flat Out Worn Out,"I don’t even know why I’m posting this, just my turn to scream into the void I guess.

I’ve got the best wife/roommate anyone could ask for. That’s what I tell myself on the daily. She is legit a kind person at heart, a great mom, and a hard worker. She’s been with me through thick and thin.

I have zero intention of ending things. I take comfort somewhat in knowing “Okay, this is my life now.” and the predictability that comes with that.

I messed up. The honeymoon period ended, and I hadn’t noticed. I then spent a few years blaming her. But over the past 5 years, I’ve realized how it was me who let her down. I didn’t live up to expectations. Plus, life just happens. It’s also statistically shown that women lose an interest in their partner sexually in most relationships over time, it’s natural.

Between me only focusing on myself, and life, I understand how she no longer is attracted to me. When she told me about 2 years ago, that I’m literally not a sexual thought and haven’t been for awhile, that was my wake up call.

I’ve held onto every word she’s said since. I take notes in my phone to make sure I nail birthday/anniversary/Christmas gift ideas as they come up in conversation. I can’t cook, but I’m a hell of a cleaner. I’ve adjusted my work schedule [since I’m lucky enough to be able to] to help with the kiddo more so she has time to hit the gym herself throughout the week.

We do movie night, I make sure to get ice cream on the way home on Friday nights. I do the grocery runs, and get coffee & treats on the weekends for her and the kid to wake up to. I l’ve always fixed everything around the house, the vehicles, I do the yard work, my laundry, scoop the litter boxes; ANYTHING that is asked or could need doing, I’ll do. I also make sure to help out with whatever crafting projects she has going on.

So, outside of sex, it’s literally perfect. She’s happy, I think, and I’m soulless. I feel like a shell, punching the clock at work, then punching the clock at home. I have a boss I at work who I can move mountains for, and it doesn’t matter. It’s like I’m an inconvenience to her at times. Whatever, it’s a job [don’t get me wrong, love my job!!] But the best part is, I can come home at the end of the day, and experience the same exact thing.

If she’s not buried in her phone scrolling Etsy or Instagram/Facebook, she’s telling me about how crap her day was. I rub her feet for a bit, she makes dinner while I clean/play with kiddo, dinner, bath, she puts the kiddo to sleep as I’m cleaning the kitchen, then it’s off to bed for her. [“Bed” actually means get ready for bed then lay under the covers on the phone for another hour.]

Since I’m so used to this routine at this point, I don’t try for sex. It’s to the point there’s a 50% chance that I’ll even end up sleeping in the same room at this point.

So once everyone’s asleep, I can have my time. That consists of punishing myself in the gym until midnight 4-5 nights a week. Come home, maybe rub one out, pass out, wake up, do it all again.

And at this point, I’m okay with it. I accept it. It’s predictable. It’s steady. It’s not what I want, but fuck what I want. I have a house, career, family; why bother bringing up a topic that goes nowhere? A conversation about intimacy consists of me pouring my heart out for 30 minutes, and getting a blank stare and head nod in return. But I’m not mad at her, I don’t blame her, it’s years of my actions that caused this. I broke her, so now what? I’m just supposed to get rid of her? Horrible mentality.

So I plug along. It’s gotten better I think. We did therapy early last year [shortly after the “I’m not sexually attracted to you” comment]. Some good practices learned, but overall fell flat on its face. I do still try to hit date nights since that was a topic of discussion, and again, life just gets busy. But regarding the sex topic, my last session with our therapist ended with her asking what my plans were if S/O still has no interest in sex. My reply was that my hand and porn got me through the last few years, why end a good thing [joking]. She legit accepted that answer, almost as if the problem solved itself it felt like.

So here I am today. Typing this out in a parking lot on my lunch break, because all I can think about, day in, and day out, is the abysmal state I feel like my relationship is in, with a partner who honestly doesn’t seem bothered. So maybe I shouldn’t be bothered either.

I was however considering a lobotomy this morning on my drive to work. Are there any doctors who still offer that? 🤣🤣🤣 ",2,1759251497.0,DeadBedrooms,4,0.67,False
1nuimg3,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1nuimg3/my_husband_died_three_years_ago_but_his_shadow/,"My husband died three years ago, but his shadow still appears in my house","I hate using the word widow but that’s what I am.

I’ve been that for three years now, ever since my husband died from a liver infection caused by chronic hepatitis.

We never had kids and it hasn’t been easy to get used to an empty house. I try to fill my time with work and volunteering at church. I haven’t moved on yet but I’m trying, one step at a time.

Strange things started happening to me about a month ago.

It began one night when I woke up suddenly in the middle of the night to the sound of the curtains moving and decided to grab a glass of water. When I opened the fridge, its light cast two clear shadows on the floor. I let out a scream and dropped the glass.

There was nobody behind me or anywhere in the house. I searched every room, terrified it might be an intruder. I convinced myself I’d imagined it and went back to bed.

But the next night the same strange waking happened. I got up to use the bathroom and when I flipped the ceiling light on, two shadows appeared on the floor again.

It was obvious nobody was there so I just stood there confused, trying to figure out if it was some weird trick of the light. Then I noticed the outline of the other shadow. It was a man. Not only that but the build and the hair were exactly like my husband’s.

I must have stared at that shadow for minutes, stunned, until it moved on its own like it had a life of its own.

It took a few steps toward me, raised a hand like it was telling me to come closer, and then vanished.

\*\*\*

The next day after service I went out for coffee with Adam and told him what had happened.

Adam was a divorced man my age who also volunteered at the church. We’d become friends.

“Maybe he just wants to know if you’re okay,” he said, sounding skeptical.

“I don’t think that’s it,” I said, not wanting to explain why.

“Then maybe try talking back,” he shrugged. “You might find out what he wants.”

Adam looked uncomfortable with the whole conversation, even more so because it was obvious he liked me. I’ll admit I liked him too but I was afraid to get close to anyone after my husband.

Still, I tried his idea. On the nights it happened again, every couple of days, I spoke to the shadow like I was speaking to my late husband.

If it understood me, it didn’t care. The gestures stayed the same and even got sharper and more aggressive as the days went on. Always the same hand motioning for me to come closer. But come where?

Things really escalated one night when I didn’t wake up naturally. I woke up choking in darkness.

Something was pressing hard against my face and I couldn’t breathe. I thrashed on the bed, my lungs burning, and managed to fall off and break free.

It was my pillow that had been over my head but there was nobody in the room. I ran to switch on the light and saw the man’s shadow next to the bed. Its face stretched like it was smiling.

\*\*\*

I didn’t sleep for the rest of the night. I left the house and wandered until dawn. I just couldn’t stay there.

I went to work but left early, my mind stuck on what had happened. I called Adam and we met at the same café where I told him everything.

“There’s something off about this,” he said, thinking. “Why would your husband want to hurt you?”

“You didn’t know him, Adam,” I answered, tears streaming. “He’s not the kind of man who’d want me happy without him.”

Then I told him everything I’d never told anyone. How I’d met my husband when I was seventeen and he used my innocence to trap me in that house. How jealous, obsessive, and possessive he was.

“He’ll never leave me alone,” I finished, stunned at how much I’d said.

Adam’s expression shifted from doubt to pity. I don’t know if he believed the crazy story about shadows but he invited me to stay at his place in the guest room.

I hesitated but agreed. My closest family lived three hundred miles away and there was no way I was sleeping in my house.

He was very kind and respectful. We ordered Chinese and watched a movie on opposite ends of the couch. I wondered if this was what normal couples were like.

Later I said good night and went straight to my room where exhaustion hit me and I practically passed out on the bed.

I only woke up again in the middle of the night to a sharp noise, like something falling. Terrified, I stepped into Adam’s hallway but didn’t find him in the living room.

I noticed his bedroom door was half open and the light was on. I called his name but got no answer, so I pushed the door and saw the worst thing I’ve ever seen in my life.

Adam’s pale body was hanging in the air, stiff, his legs twitching. His neck was tied to the curtain, twisted into a rope like a noose.

And beside him, my husband’s shadow was cast on the wall, making that same gesture with his hand.

\*\*\*

I rushed to cut the rope, but it was too late. So I called 911, grabbed my things and left the house right then. I caught the first bus to my mother’s and that’s where I am now.

Mom was happy to see me but confused by the terror on my face. Two days have passed and I’ve barely eaten a thing.

She must be wondering why I can’t find any words to explain what happened, and especially why every night I refuse to turn on any light in the house. ",16,1759251428.0,nosleep,5,0.9,False

I'm looking for a considerate, responsible, and communicative roommate(s) to share a large 2 or 3 bedroom apartment near 14th and 1st Street in Stuyvesant Town. The apartment will be permanently stabilized and utilities other than broadband are included in the rent! I will likely take the master bedroom so I'll be paying more than you.

They always have a variety of apartments available, and as I'm a current tenant in good standing, they're willing to work with me on telling me about new units available. I'll be upfront that I'd prefer a higher floor apartment that faces south. That's really my only preference! My personal ceiling for my part of the rent is about $2600, but the lower the better.

**Me:**

I'm in my 30s and I work in academia 5 days a week in the office. When I have downtime, I'm working out, hanging out with friends outside the apartment, and reading and writing. I'm an ambivert and I'm a big literature and performing arts person. We don't have to become friends but very cool if we do or just go for drinks or watch a film from time to time. I love listening to music and watching films at home (though not loudly!); however, I am not someone who has lots of parties or has tons of people over at once save the very rare occasion. I want to live with people who are similar.

I'm not a neat freak, but I'd like folks who are good about cleaning up after themselves. I'm happy to have a day or evening where we all spend an hour cleaning, or am happy to split costs on a professional cleaner once a month or so.

**You:**

\- Communicative, kind, easy-going, considerate of others, and can commit to either a cleaning schedule or hiring a cleaner 1-2 times a month.

\- Can sign onto a one year lease.

**The Apartment:**

**- All ST apartments are huge, especially by East Village standards!**

\- Non-master bedrooms are approximately 10' x 12"" and often have large closets.

\- unfurnished except for AC. I could give you my clothing racks if you like, though!

\- Rent: depending on the unit, $2000-2500, which includes water, electricity, gas, AC. Broadband will be split between us. I'm looking to get Fios, maybe Spectrum and don't want to spend more than $100 a month.

\- Huge living and dining room - in most units they are about 12' x 20'. I already have a dining table and a couple dining chairs. I plan to buy more. I have an old couch I can bring, but eventually I'll buy a new one unless you have a better one you want to bring. I'm not attached to mine.

\- Kitchen with dishwasher and appliances

\- Bathroom includes a tub.

\- Laundry on the ground floor - it's quite affordable

\- Beautiful views from bedrooms and kitchen

**In addition, Stuyvesant Town has:**

\- 24/7 Security

\- Gym, cafe, library, ice skating rink in winter, extra storage space on the ground floor for an extra fee if you need it

\- Basketball, pickleball courts, playgrounds

\- Lots of green spaces, including a huge lawn

\- L train, Whole Foods, Trader Joe's, Target, some of the best bars in the city are a 5 minute walk away.

**Next Steps:**

If you're interested, please let me know what you do for work, or if you study, and your income level - their threshold is 36x the rent. I'll do a video call with you first, and then if we vibe, I'd love to meet you over a coffee. You're welcome to bring a dog or cat or any other small animal you have - I love cats and dogs. I'm not opposed to couples if we're a good match, but the rent would be higher for you than for one person.

\- Rent: depending on the unit, $2000-2500, which includes water, electricity, gas, AC. Broadband will be split between us. I'm looking to get Fios, maybe Spectrum and don't want to spend more than $100 a month.

\- Huge living and dining room - in most units they are about 12' x 20'. I already have a dining table and a couple dining chairs. I plan to buy more. I have an old couch I can bring, but eventually I'll buy a new one unless you have a better one you want to bring. I'm not attached to mine.

\- Kitchen with dishwasher and appliances

\- Bathroom includes a tub.

\- Laundry on the ground floor - it's quite affordable

\- Beautiful views from bedrooms and kitchen

**In addition, Stuyvesant Town has:**

\- 24/7 Security

\- Gym, cafe, library, ice skating rink in winter, extra storage space on the ground floor for an extra fee if you need it

\- Basketball, pickleball courts, playgrounds

\- Lots of green spaces, including a huge lawn

\- L train, Whole Foods, Trader Joe's, Target, some of the best bars in the city are a 5 minute walk away.

**Next Steps:**

If you're interested, please let me know what you do for work, or if you study, and your income level - their threshold is 36x the rent. I'll do a video call with you first, and then if we vibe, I'd love to meet you over a coffee. You're welcome to bring a dog or cat or any other small animal you have - I love cats and dogs. I'm not opposed to couples if we're a good match, but the rent would be higher for you than for one person.

I focused on the deceased. I didn't focus on the sitter. 

If you are a beginner, this will happen to you. If you are a veteran of more than twenty years, it will happen to you.

Occasionally. I get a sitter who has a negative agenda. Psychics feel the sitter. All I felt was scorn and a need to prove something.

I will shake it off during my next reading. 

I share this because psychic and psychic mediums do have these odd readings.

Mine gave me mixed vibes. I was shown one thing and the sitter either didnt know the souls they requested or didnt know them at all. 

Hang in there. Take a walk. Take a break. Have some tea or coffee and have a treat. Move forward.

I ended up confronting him over that weekend (before the meet up was supposed to happen) asking him multiple times what he's doing Monday and he would just say the same thing, leaving out seeing his ex. So then I asked if he's meeting anyone and he looked at me like I was crazy. I told him I'd like him think about his answer before he said something he'd regret.

I went to put our baby to sleep and he came in wanting to talk about it. It still took a long time for him to admit that he was hiding it.

He said he had no intention of cheating and thought it was just a simple getting coffee since she returned to town and they could network (working in similar fields). I asked if it's so simple, why not just tell me? We always tell each other when we have plans, even if it's little/simple. He said he didn't know, was being stupid, and was sorry.

I told him I didn't think that was a good answer and he needed to figure it out, and that not figuring it out would only lead to divorce. He freaked out at the divorce mention and said he didn't want that. He canceled the coffee date or whatever it was.

We're setting up a session with a marriage counselor.

I feel very lonely and sad. Just lost. And angry. I don't believe him. I don't feel like he respects me. He's lied to my face multiple times. I don't understand why. I told him I feel like he just doesn't want a divorce, which he denied and said he wanted our family.

On top of my 4 months postpartum I get to deal with this. It comes to my mind in every quiet moment. I was just beginning to feel better after dealing with some PPA, and I feel like it's now on turbo.

I don't really have anyone I can talk to about this. My friends would listen, but I know what they'd all say and it's not helpful right now.

I don't want to sit around and wait for him to do this again, even though he says he wouldn't (like how am I supposed to believe that??). I don't want to end our marriage, even though it feels like it is anyway.

It's very dark and I can't think. I think a marriage counselor will help.

Last week we matched on Bumble. We both recognized each other and started talking. Moved off to whatsapp. We had a coffee. After then our convos were like “good morning, how are you, whats up”. When i didnt reply once he asked”morning, is our connection cut off😅” so i thought he was interested but then he got cold. He also told me he is against everything emotionless. Conversation started being boring with no deep things to talk to and he started not to use emojis and replying late. But still he was texting but he also didnt make any plan to see me. We go to the same gym so he alwayd said he wants to see me and talk to me at the gym. And on Saturday we came across at the gym. He was about to start and i was about to leave. We did small talk then i left he semt a bit shy(he is a shy person). After then no texting from him. The next day in the evening i texted him “how are you, did we stop talking” and hours later at night he texted me”i think we should not continue, you want a serious relationship and im not ready for it. I dont want to steal your time” i texted “i think your reason is not consistent, and i couldnt understand how you got i want a serious relationship but thanks for you honesty. Wishing you the best” he texted “you’re welcome, same to you”.

I really didnt understand what happened after that gym encounter. Maybe he was always in question if he is interested or not. Maybe he found someone better on the app etc but i am just curious if this was real or just an excuse? What do you guys think? And since i really found him cute and shy i got so sad and after that rejection i cried and i still somewhat have hope that he will text again but my logic says he won’t. LTRD; the guy said i want a serious relationship even though i never stated such thing and he said he doesnt want to steal my time.

It was such a wonderful time away from the real world. 

I was even able to go get a pedicure and do a couple of other self care things on my own in between feeds. I healed well and was up and about and energetic.

My son is now almost 11 weeks old and this is where I'm struggling. I don't know how to integrate back into the world.

He's been a fairly easy baby in the sense that he responds to routine. Any time he struggled with anything we'd implement a way to soothe or a schedule and he would take a couple days and adapt to it. Sleeps for 5-6 hour over night, has been able to play independently. Loves to ""talk"" to his stuffed animals and b&w cards. He's very happy and playful. But, he is now almost too switched on during the day and needs me constantly in a way that is draining.

I have a very flexible, supportive wfh job. I started working on a very part time basis and won't be going back full time until January. I enjoy it l, like being able to dial into that side of myself, and have been putting in the occasional hour here and there and it has worked well until this week. 

I'm a department of 1 so I set up a few meetings to just catch up with other departments on their projects/needs this morning. He woke up from his nap during and was crying. He did not want to be set down. Which is fine. If he would just hang out in a carrier. But he's so active now, he spent the meetings pulling my hair, kicking his legs, and fussing. These were 1:1 internal meetings with people I knew, but I felt so unprofessional. 

He did not want his mat or bouncer, just me, but he wanted me to engage him or he would fuss.

My husband is great. Super hands on. We also have a trusted babysitter.

But suddenly, he is taking more from me. I can't sneak away for a workout or pedicure anymore. I can't clear the dishwasher or do a load of laundry. He is nursing and I barely can get a shirt on most days. Not even in a clusterfeeding way, but just a constant. I've done some solo things with him, but that was all 2 weeks ago. Ever since then, he has just drained me because he requires so much stimulation constantly and I'm exhausted so don't have it in me to take him out for a mommy and me class or an errand.

Even as I type this, I'm crying. I had to end my meeting and tend to him. That was over an hour ago and he has just been so fussy and won't let me set him down, but then if I talk to him he starts smiling and laughing and cooing. If I look away for even a second, he starts to kick and get upset.

He's ahead of all of his milestones. He seems very happy and bright.

My husband will be home soon and he does so much, but it still feels like our baby takes so much from me. He isn't as clingy with him. He has tried to get me out of the house to go do things for myself or grab a cup of coffee, but even with our best efforts, something has changed from a few weeks ago.

Tonight we have a date planned and I was so excited for it but I feel so frazzled and still have almost 20 lbs of pp weight and know that trying to do my hair or makeup or wearing real clothes will be rendered pointless because our baby will be pawing on me until I'm out the door. I want to be able to workout (even with my little babe, but he won't stop squirming), or go to pilates, lidten to a podcast without having to replay it several times, or shave my legs.

On top of that, I think I'm getting some of my pms symptoms back since I've been spotting (my hormones felt very stable throughout pregnancy and postpartum up until now).

The anxiety was so bad I'd feel nauseous just seeing the Gmail tab. Responded to exactly nothing unless someone texted me ""did you see my email?""

Tried everything. 
Inbox Zero methods, those complex folder systems, declaring email bankruptcy twice. 
Even set up an auto-responder saying I only check email on Fridays. (I didn't check it on Fridays either.)

Then I had this unhinged idea: what if I just pretended email was a really boring social media feed?

Started ""scrolling"" my inbox like it was Twitter. No pressure to respond, just browsing. Star things like they're favorites. Archive stuff like I'm clearing my feed. If something needs a response, I pretend I'm leaving a YouTube comment - keep it short, who cares if it's perfect, just react and move on.

The weird part? It worked. My brain stopped treating emails like assignments and started treating them like... content. Reply to three emails while waiting for coffee, like I'm commenting on posts. 

Clear out marketing emails like I'm unfollowing accounts.

Even started ""hate-reading"" corporate newsletters and responding with one-line replies like ""unsubscribe"" or ""thanks!"" just to feel something. Sometimes I respond ""sounds good!"" to things that definitely need more thought, but somehow that keeps conversations moving better than my previous paralyzed silence.

Currently at inbox alot less than 3000+ (still scrolling my way through, should just delete it all, I know). Not zero, but I actually respond to people now. My accountant stopped firing warning shots about tax deadlines.

I was about to post a query here wondering about K6 slipping gears or something….when all of the sudden one morning about 3 weeks later, the extraction time skyrocketed. Adjusting the grinder back 4 clicks brought me back to where everything had been before. 

Anybody experienced this? The only difference was environmental; the barometric pressure and humidity had been very high during that time, and the return to normal operation coincided with the end of a rain that had been building for weeks. I ran it by a local barista, who said that was a common occurrence. She said sometimes their shop would have to adjust grind settings throughout the day. Up until then, I’d have assumed that the inside of a portafilter/group head was sealed enough to be unaffected by such things. ",3,1759250383.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

***

**_Hydration Game Cheat Codes_**

1. _Start Your Day With 20–30 oz_

Before food, before coffee. Wake your organs up right.

**Quick tip**- You wake up dehydrated by default. Rehydrating before anything else turns your system back on.

2. _Add Minerals_

Pure water flushes. Water with minerals absorbs. Add Himalayan salt, lemon, or electrolytes.

**Quick tip**- Water alone doesn’t hydrate as well without electrolytes. This locks it in

3. _Carry a Jug You Can Track_

Drink half your bodyweight in ounces daily (if you weigh 180, aim for 90 oz) 

**Quick tip**- Get a 32 oz jug = 3–4 fills a day = done. No second guessing.

4. _Pair With Habits_

	•	Before meals
	•	After peeing
	•	While scrolling
	•	Between sets

5. _Go Warm or Room Temp_

Better gut absorption , Smoother digestion, less  bloating or gut tension, especially in the morning.

**Quick tip**- Cold water can slow digestion. Warm water passes through cleaner and gets absorbed faster.

6. _Watch Your Urine_

Light yellow = you’re good. 

Dark = behind. 

Clear = overdoing it.

7. _Hydration makes everything else more effective_

	•	L-citrulline(pure) hits harder with water
	•	Beet powder flows better with water
	•	Zinc Picolinate, magnesium glycinate, and creatine need water to transport
	•	Sleep and blood flow quality both depend on hydration status

She barely eats (mostly coffee, cigarettes, tiny meals) and often makes comments about how much people in North America eat. She also talks a lot about her body — for example, on a past trip when I suggested getting gelato, she said she’d just have it instead of dinner, and mentioned she’d go home “so skinny.”

For context, I work out a lot and try to eat a healthy balance — yogurt, fruit, salads, nuts, and also some treats. I’m not “skinny” like her, but I feel good about how I take care of myself. Still, when she’s constantly restricting or making comments, I sometimes find myself second-guessing what I eat or how I look.

For me, food is a big part of traveling and I don’t want to feel guilty for enjoying it. But it’s challenging to stay grounded around her when every decision around food seems to be carefully calculated.

1nui08q,https://www.reddit.com/r/NinjaLuxeCafe/comments/1nui08q/thoughts_on_quality/,Thoughts on quality,"I would like to know what percentage of these units have been replaced or refunded  during the warranty period. Ninja, in general, has a huge loyal fan base with all their products. As with anything sold at high volume, there are always duds. What is encouraging is that Ninja seems to offer pretty decent support. What is concerning is the posters who have had multiple bad units. I've had mine (601) since July, use it everyday, and love it. Am I more the norm? Exception? Or is it too early to tell? 

The other issue is really more personal taste than a ""defect."" These are not professional machines.  Most of us are not baristas. There is criticism about grind size, ratios, timing, crema, etc. I really wasn't expecting perfection. I was expecting something I can  enjoy that doesn't require I jump in my car, go to the coffee shop and spend $10 on1 drink. I think the Ninja has provided that. I love my cappuccino every morning made with what some describe has inferior beans, Lavazza, but the presentation is beautiful ( which I've posted) and I am very satisfied with the smooth rich taste. 

Next is counter space and cleaning. Years ago I tried a more ""professional"" machine, separate grinder, tiny cups....the whole nine yards. It was a total mess, difficult to clean, etc. I ended up taking it to the thrift store and just drank drip coffee. The Ninja has been a space saver, it's still a bit messy, but so much easier to clean.  

So, what's next. After getting back to drinking cappuccino, iced lattes, cold brew...what will I do if thing dies on me? I likely will want to upgrade. I have more time and money to play with it now and learning so much about the process makes you more motivated.

1nuhzkd,https://www.reddit.com/r/breakingmom/comments/1nuhzkd/one_step_forward_two_steps_back/,"One step forward, two steps back","My youngest just turned eighteen this month. It's been a rocky road for him the past several years. When he started Kindergarten, the school put him on an IEP for Autism. Honestly, the first years of school weren't that bad; he'd get in the occasional mood, but school went pretty smoothly. He was generally happy, engaged, all that good stuff. He was never much of a social butterfly but that didn't really seem to concern him (or his dad and I, as we aren't, either). 

When he started middle school, things started to get a bit worse. He became more detached, moody, morose... but hey, that's middle school for you, right? He was still doing well in class, great grades, and his teachers didn't have any complaints; we had chalked it up to a mix of hormones and neurodivergence. 

High school is when things started getting bad for him. It started the summer before school started; his older brother was pretty big into marching band. It did wonders for him, and we were hoping it'd be a great way to help our youngest get a bit more social as well (we did not force him to join up; he wanted to give it a try as well). They do a band camp thing for a week over the summer. Maybe two or three days in, the older one texted me maybe a couple hours into the day asking me where his brother was. I was like ""uh, there with you, hopefully??"" Long story short, he had become overwhelmed and fucked off to the bathroom where he was apparently camping out for hours (mind you, over three years later, I'm still irked that not a single adult noticed he was missing - only my son did). He decided it was not for him, apparently - he would not go back.

He had been expressing feelings of depression, so around this same time, we started him on antidepressants and therapy. Noticed some slight improvements with the medication sometimes; other times, he'd just leave class and start walking home without notifying anyone at all. He had wanted to join JROTC, for reasons unbeknownst to me, and we figured some structure couldn't hurt so we let him give it a try. He was really bad at remembering all of the uniform pieces as well as sticking with the training regimens they performed. At one point, another student made a comment along the lines of ""If you're not going to try, why are you here?"" which was a pretty fair question. My son responded by hitting him with the flagpole he was carrying, supposedly bruising his side. The school was understanding; the other kid's mom even more so (cajoling her not to press charges was so fun); he spent some time in DAEP but was eventually sent back to mainstream. This was the first and last time he has ever been violent, and we feel strongly that it might have been a side effect of the medication he was on at the time.

We've tried therapy several times with several therapists - he won't engage. Over the past few years, he's been on and off of a few antidepressants. Behaviors have been erratic, though. Sometimes he's just zoned out. We caught him sneaking alcohol several times, once during which he was drunk enough to express how fucking lonely he is and how he feels out of control of his actions.

I felt like we were finally making progress this year, though. He started Prozac before school started and his disposition has improved greatly, at least outwardly. He used to just mope around the house and pretty much ignore his dad and I unless we explicitly asked him a question. Even then, the ""hi's"" and ""byes"" and ""love yous!"" were usually ignored. Now, he responds to us, he's cordial, we'll have little conversations here and there... it really felt like we turned a corner this year! Started off the year real strong - A's and B's in all of his classes (most of which are AP). 

Lately, he has expressed that he feels totally numb inside. The doctor thought maybe his dose was too high, so she lowered the Prozac and added Wellbutrin. He's been on that regimen for about a week now. I was getting ready for work this morning and this child was fucking WIRED. I was like, dude. He recently has gotten into coffee and the art of making espresso. He mentioned that he had like ten cups of coffee. This is not the first time I've had to talk to him about over-caffeinating and how awful that is for his health. He mentioned not feeling like he could control his impulses, which is not a new theme . I told him, again, that maybe you need to consider giving therapy a try again; they can help you create better coping mechanisms.

He sent me an email today that really, for the first time, outlined some of the specific things he's feeling, emotionally and physically. On one hand, he articulated it very well, which I think is a turning point because he's never explained it in this detail before. On the other hand, it absolutely kills me because I don't know what to do for him. He sounds fucking miserable. I've suffered from depression as well but even I've never felt as hopeless as what he describes. Mixing in the physical symptoms, I think there must be a deeper issue here than just depression so I am going to take him into his physician to see if maybe there's some kind of specialist that they can send us to. 

Sorry, just had to get that all out. I just don't know how to help him. I stopped bringing hard liquor into the house but what am I supposed to do, keep the coffee under lock and key? I don't know how to get him to reroute those impulses towards something more productive because if I take away the coffee, it's just going to be something else, right?

Hello! I'm someone who thrives on creativity, curiosity, and connection. My heart truly belongs to the arts—whether I'm singing along to a musical, learning a new dance routine, or getting lost in a character while acting. I love the process of creating anything from scratch, be it a crochet project, a piece of art, or a story.

My mind is just as active as my hands! I'm a bit of an epistemophile and philomath (a lover of knowledge and learning), which means I'm constantly down a research rabbit hole or buried in a book. While I have a soft spot for self-help and a good romance novel, I'm always open to new literary adventures. This love for learning extends to Asian culture, and I'm currently on the rewarding journey of learning the Japanese language.

When I'm not creating or studying, you can find me enjoying all kinds of games. From the strategic depths of Dungeons & Dragons and board games to the immersive worlds of video and VR games, I believe games are a fantastic way to bond and have fun.

Above all, I value genuine, kind-hearted people. I am pansexual. I have a deep love and unwavering support for the LGBTQ+ community and believe everyone deserves to be their authentic self. I’m looking to build real, supportive friendships here in Huntsville Alabama, and I’d be thrilled to connect with fellow curious and creative souls.



I am willing to do any of these.
· Be Bold: ""I really enjoyed talking with you about [D&D/that book/musicals]. Would you be interested in grabbing coffee sometime?""
· Suggest a Specific, Low-Pressure Activity: ""A few of us are going to try the new ramen place next week, would you like to join?""
· Use Your Shared Interest: ""I'm trying to start a new crochet project, would you want to work on our projects together at the library sometime?""

Hello there! I'm a person who feels music deeply—it's the soundtrack to my life. My playlist is a vibrant mix of everything from the storytelling of country and the energy of rap to the catchy hooks of pop, the soul of R&B, and the powerful emotions of Broadway musicals. If a song has a great beat and a meaningful message, it has my heart. This love often turns into movement; I adore dancing, especially hip-hop, and I love the creative challenge of choreographing my own routines.

When I'm not lost in music, you'll often find me happily falling down a research rabbit hole. I'm a naturally curious person, and learning about my favorite topics is a joyful hyperfixation of mine. One of my favorite ways to relax is to combine this with my love for creating; you'll frequently find me crocheting something new while listening to an audiobook or a long, informative YouTube video.

I'm neurodivergent and still learning about my own beautiful, complex brain. I experience traits associated with autism, anxiety, depression, and BPD, which means I experience the world with a lot of intensity, passion, and deep empathy. While my conversations often light up when we're discussing my favorite subjects, I am genuinely excited to learn about what you love. Nothing makes me happier than hearing someone talk passionately about their own interests.

I'm looking for friends who appreciate authenticity, can share in deep dives on random topics, and maybe even have a spontaneous dance break with me.
""I really want someone to dance and hang out& parallel play with"" 

1. Leading with Passion, Not Labels:

· Original: ""I like all alternative music...""
· Reframed: Starting with ""I feel music deeply"" is an emotional invitation. It explains the why behind your interest, which is more relatable than a list. People connect with feelings first and details second.

2. Turning ""Hyperfixation"" into a Shared Activity:

· Original: ""going down rabbit holes it is a hyper fixation of mine.""
· Reframed: Phrases like ""I'm a naturally curious person"" and ""joyful hyperfixation"" frame this trait positively. It transforms it from an internal experience into a potential shared joy: ""Want to fall down a Wikipedia rabbit hole with me about the history of crochet?"" or ""Do you have any podcast recommendations for while I work on my next project?""

3. Disclosing Neurodivergence with Strength and Clarity:

· Original: The list of conditions can feel overwhelming to someone who doesn't understand them.
· Reframed: Stating you are ""still learning about my own beautiful, complex brain"" is disarming and honest. It focuses on the outcomes—""intensity, passion, and deep empathy""—which are wonderful qualities in a friend. This explains your communication style (""I light up when we're discussing my favorite subjects"") while simultaneously showing you're a great listener (""I am genuinely excited to learn about what you love""). This is a very inviting balance.


"" I would love to hang out together doing an activity based thing or topic. Or just show up for each other and parallel play in person or on the phone. We can even body double on a task for each other.""

· Use Your ""Deep Dive"" Superpower: When you meet someone, ask them, ""What could you talk about for hours?"" This question invites them to share their passion and signals that you are a safe person for deep, enthusiastic conversations.
· Script an Opening Line: Having a friendly, prepared line can ease social anxiety. It could be as simple as:
  · ""I'm really passionate about [music/choreography/crochet]. What's something you're really into right now?""
  · ""I love learning about new things. Tell me something interesting you've learned lately!""

Your willingness to be open and your capacity for passionate interest are beautiful qualities that will attract the right kind of friends. The key is to present these traits as the strengths they are. You are not just looking for a friend; you are looking for a friend to share deep dives, creative projects, and honest conversations with—and that is a wonderful offer.

To my future friends in North Alabama,

If you're reading this and feel a connection, I'd love to hear from you! Building genuine, trusting friendships is my goal.

To create a comfortable and secure environment for everyone, including myself, I want to be upfront about my boundaries. For personal reasons rooted in past experiences, I am not seeking one-on-one friendships with straight men. My deepest and most important friendship is with my husband, and our relationship is built on a foundation of mutual trust and transparency.

The one exception to this is if a straight man is interested in becoming a friend to both of us as a couple. In that case, any friendship would naturally include my husband, and our interactions would be as a group. This isn't about monitoring, but about building a connection that respects the primary partnership in my life.

For everyone else—women and LGBTQ+ folks—I am thrilled and open to building a direct, one-on-one friendship with you. My husband is a wonderful part of my life, but he doesn't need to be a central part of our friendship.

On a related but separate note, while my primary goal is finding deep friendships, my husband and I are ethically non-monogamous. We are open to the possibility of a polyamorous relationship, but only with the right, rare connection that develops very naturally over time. (Female only) This is not an invitation, but a piece of information for full transparency.

My hope is to find kind, understanding people who value honesty as much as I do. If this sounds like a friendship you'd be comfortable with, please don't hesitate to reach out.

A More Heartfelt and Friendly Revision

I believe friendship is one of life's greatest adventures—a shared journey of discovery, support, and joy. While I have a wonderful and secure marriage, I am yearning to build a deep, passionate platonic bond with someone else; a unique connection that stands on its own.

My ideal is to find a local friend for in-person connection here in North Alabama, but I'm absolutely open to the magic of a strong online friendship as well.

What would our friendship look like? I dream of the simple, meaningful things: reading the same book and getting lost in conversation about it, having a weekly FaceTime call to watch a movie together, or just talking for an hour about life, our dreams, and whatever we're currently obsessed with. I thrive on that kind of consistent, low-pressure connection. A quick check-in once a week would mean the world to me and help a bond grow strong.

While I have my own favorite topics I could talk about for hours, I am genuinely excited to learn about what lights you up. A true friend celebrates both shared passions and new perspectives.

If you're looking for a loyal, curious, and dedicated friend to build a genuine, consistent connection with, I would be so happy to hear from you.

This started out as a curiosity project to help me remember new vocabulary. White learning Indonesian, I kept noticing many words borrowed from all over, Dutch, Arabic, Portuguese, Sanskrit, Chinese, ... Basically every time I learnt a new word, I went down a rabbit hole of where the hell did this word come from?

I tried google translate, but it took ages to check multiple languages, so I ended up making a quick website to scratch that itch: [https://wordatlas.io/](https://wordatlas.io/)

Basically:  
Type in an English word  
It shows you how that word translates across the world on a map and colour codes it

Two modes:  
Colour countries by language  
Colour countries by how similar the words sound

I wanted to share it here, because I'm curious if I'm on the right track and whether this could be useful beyond just being a fun time sink for language nerds like me.

Life is too short to spend forcing a lukewarm connection; but at the same time, there's plenty of time for someone who feels comfortable - by themselves, in their own skin - to find that person with whom the vibes are just right.

If you're thinking the same way, why don't we meet up for dinner or a coffee and see where things go? As the title says, let's date - no fucks given.

I'll start with a few things about me - I:

* Am 5'7, lean and sort of lanky, with long flowing hair tied in either a weekday bun or weekend ponytail
* Am from the South, work in Makati, and hang out in QC often
* Work in government and briefly dipped my toes in international development
* Am a Social science grad and graduate student who just passed his comprehensives and is working on a thesis
* Am left-leaning and highly politically aware
* Collect cookbooks! (39 as of last count)
* Like accumulating books from various online bookstores, though I make relatively slow progress on reading them all – but they do eventually get read (or marked for decluttering lol)
* Bike commute to work, and hope to get a road bike for longer rides soon
* Love video and tabletop games! My competitiveness and curiosity often makes up for my initial lack of skills 😅
* Love sharing my passions with other people, whether it's a new recipe I'm trying out, a book I'm ecstatic about, or a TV show I'm morbidly obsessed with
* Am a huge yapper about a wide variety of topics but also an enthusiastic listener when needed and/or wanted
* Have been described by my siblings, friends, and coworkers as empathetic, loyal, and generous of spirit

What I'm looking for - someone who is:

* \+1/-7 years my age
* A working professional working dayshift
* Politically aware and at least liberal to left-leaning
* Curious about life, the world around us, and the people we share it with
* Comfortable in their own skin, or at least determined to become comfortable
* A yapper and thoughtful listener to match
* Deeply and unapologetically nerdy about their own passions and hobbies - maybe you can teach me yours?

I will be asking him tomorrow if he'd be down to teaching me how to roast, and I'll help in exchange, with anything that there's to do around the roaster (heavy lifting, processing, bagging, whatever). I've also noticed that they don't have an online shop yet (it's been saying ""coming soon"" since they opened) and I know how to set up e-commerce sites (I work teaching entrepreneurs how to launch).

If you're a professional roaster (he owns the café and his own coffee), **what would you be willing to get in return to teach someone how to roast while they help you out?** He's not teaching courses, so I'd like to find something that's not an economic exchange, but rather knowledge/labor, and that doesn't feel like something for him to worry about, but rather something where he'd also potentially feel fulfilled by teaching someone else. I know that's how he learned.

I find it especially difficult when traveling with friends. Inevitably we have to eat, whether it's going out or buying groceries. I get kind of stressed out when people are so vigilant about what they eat, especially on vacation. To me food is a big part of traveling and I want to experience things without counting every calorie. 

One of my friends is Italian, so food is really specific, everything should be done a certain way. I'm from North America. We went on a trip together and would spend the day beach hopping. She basically wouldn't eat anything in the morning, just coffee and maybe a biscuit or something. We'd pack a light lunch for the beach. Then when we got back I wanted to go for a nice dinner, have some wine. For her all she wanted to eat was a piece of tomato and mozzarella. I felt so gluttonous just to eat a piece of fish or something with substance. 

Clearly it's a trigger for me. I have my own stuff around food and body image but try not to fixate on it. But she'll always bring up how we eat way too much in North America, the portions etc. and yes sometimes that's true. 

But eating 500 calories a day is also not healthy. She smokes a lot and drinks a lot of coffee so maybe it suppresses her appetite, I don't know. 

It's so exhausting. Can't we just live???

1nuhkzr,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomePicks/comments/1nuhkzr/which_brands_offer_reliable_espresso_machines/,Which brands offer reliable espresso machines?,"Hey coffee enthusiasts!

I've been on a wild journey trying to find the perfect espresso machine for my home, and I thought I'd share what I've learned after months of research and testing different brands. Trust me, I've had my fair share of disappointing morning brews before finding the right one.

First off, let's talk about what makes an espresso machine reliable. It's not just about the brand name – it's about consistent pressure, temperature control, and durability. After going through three different machines (and some serious caffeine jitters), I've narrowed down the most dependable options.

Breville has consistently impressed me with their build quality. Their machines, especially the Barista Express, offer a great balance of features and reliability. I actually found a great deal on one recently (you can check it out here: https://athometouch.com/espresso-machine). The best part? They're pretty much foolproof, even for beginners.

DeLonghi is another brand that's worth mentioning. Their machines are like the Toyota of the coffee world – they just keep running. I've had friends using the same DeLonghi machine for years without issues. The EC155 model is particularly popular among home baristas.

For those willing to invest more, Rancilio makes commercial-grade machines that are built like tanks. The Silvia model is particularly famous for lasting decades with proper maintenance.

Here's a pro tip: whatever brand you choose, look for machines with metal components rather than plastic. They might cost more initially, but they'll save you money in the long run. I've found some great options with metal components at this link: https://athometouch.com/espresso-machine.

Gaggia is another solid choice, especially their Classic Pro model. It's simple, reliable, and produces consistently great shots. Plus, replacement parts are readily available if you ever need them.

Some key features to look for in any reliable espresso machine:
- 15+ bar pump pressure
- PID temperature control (if it's within your budget)
- Solid water tank construction
- Quality portafilter
- Decent steam wand for milk frothing

Remember, even the most reliable machine needs proper maintenance. Clean it regularly, descale when needed, and don't skimp on water quality. These simple steps will keep your machine running smoothly for years.

From my experience, you don't always need to go for the most expensive option to get reliability. Mid-range machines from reputable brands often offer the best value for money and longevity.

Let me know if you have any questions about specific models or features - I'm always happy to help fellow coffee lovers make informed decisions!",1,1759249075.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False
