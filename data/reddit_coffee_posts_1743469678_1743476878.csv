Finding legitimate and reliable sellers for abortion medication in the Philippines is rare, but I was fortunate to come across one. At first, I had doubts, but they patiently assured me, provided guidance, and gave me all the necessary advice throughout the preparation and procedures.

Discovery and Decision

On March 1,  I confirmed my pregnancy through an HCG blood test. That week, I started searching online for options and came across a seller. To assure me of their legitimacy, they added me to various group chats where I could observe feedback and results from other clients. Many of them vouched for the service, some using private or throwaway accounts. I also learned that the seller herself had used the same medication, and the founder of the service was active in the group chat, addressing everyone‚Äôs concerns.

After monitoring the group chat for a while, I decided to proceed. On March 17, I officially placed my order, filling out a form and preparing myself for the process. Since I was in Mindanao, the package was expected to arrive in seven days.

Preparation Phase

The seller provided me with a list of preparations to follow for 10-14 days to help my body be in the best condition for the process. This included:
- Regular exercise
- Drinking pineapple juice daily
- Consuming ginger tea and coffee
- Following a specific diet
- Using primrose oil to soften the cervix

However, I was already experiencing severe morning sickness, constant vomiting, and heightened sensitivity to smells. Because of this, I was unable to fully commit to the preparation steps. The only thing I managed to do was drink one can of pineapple juice since I craved it.

The Medication Arrival & Process

On March 24, my package arrived in a small, discreet accessory box. I confirmed with the seller that everything was included.

On March 25, I asked when I could start the process. Since I believed I was already around 10 weeks pregnant, I was panicking. The seller asked if I had followed the 10-14 day preparation properly. Although I had not done so, I lied and said I started on March 20. Thankfully, I had read that the preparation was not strictly necessary and decided to trust my body.

With a set date for the procedure, I spent the remaining days resting and preparing myself mentally and physically.

The Abortion Process

On March 30, I fasted the entire day, only drinking water and pineapple juice. The seller provided detailed step-by-step instructions, infographics, and guidance for the procedure.

- 5:07 PM:Took the first dose of Mifepristone and waited 30 minutes.
- 5:37 PM: Took Ibuprofen for pain management, then the remaining Mifepristone. Placed Misoprostol under my tongue and inserted additional Misoprostol vaginally while elevating my legs.
- 6:10 PM: Swallowed the dissolved Misoprostol and continued to keep my legs elevated.

Shortly after, I began experiencing side effects:
- 7:08 PM: Itching in my hands, legs, and feet (a normal allergic reaction).
- 7:40 PM:Mild cramps started but were tolerable.
- 9:00 - 9:49 PM: Intense cramps began, so painful that I started crying.
- 10:03 PM:Light bleeding started; I changed my napkin and laid back down.
- 11:00 PM: Heavier bleeding began. Feeling weak from fasting, I drank pineapple juice to gain some energy.
- 11:26 PM: I stand up amd a little walk in my room, Passed a large clot onto my napkin, sent a photo to the seller for confirmation for sac and embryo.

The seller confirmed it was part of the process.

I went to wash myself with warm water, but as I was about to leave the bathroom, I felt another strong urge. Rushing back, I passed the placenta onto the floor.

At that moment, I experienced a mix of emotions‚Äîrelief, sadness, and exhaustion. My partner was by my side the entire time, providing me with emotional and physical support. Together, we buried the embryo, closing this chapter with respect and care.

I still experience bleeding till now but not that intense. Had to take ibuprofens since my lower back is pain as hell right now. Will expect this to last till the bleeding is gone.

Abortion is a deeply personal decision, and no one should feel ashamed for making the choice that is best for them. If you are in the Philippines and considering this option, here are some key takeaways from my experience:

1. Find a legitimate and trustworthy source ‚Äì Research well, join private groups, and check verified reviews. Scammers exist, so be cautious.

2. Listen to your body‚Äì While preparation steps may be helpful, do what you can and don‚Äôt push yourself too hard.

3. Have a support system‚Äì Whether it's a partner, a friend, or an online community, emotional and physical support is invaluable.

4. Follow the instructions carefully‚Äì Take the medications as directed and ensure you‚Äôre in a safe, private space during the process.

5. Stay strong and prioritize your well-being ‚Äì You are not alone, and many others have gone through this too. Healing, both physically and emotionally, takes time, so be kind to yourself.

If you are unsure or need guidance, consider reaching out to safe and legitimate organizations that provide reproductive health support.

To anyone reading this who may be in the same situation: You are strong. You are capable. You are not alone. Whatever decision you make, it is valid, and your well-being matters above all else.

The first venue we saw is nice from the outside  and the inside. It can accommodates our number of guests also. The only con is that the catering food cost and reception bar is a little pricy for our budget.

The second venue is in an industrial area but when you enter inside it is very beautiful. Also the food cost is better than the first one. The con is that because it‚Äôs a lunch reception the reception is not included and we have to provide our own bartender and booze.

1joloag,https://i.redd.it/wrtuj2ud25se1.jpeg,Laptop Table Locks,"Once upon a time, when I lived in NYC, I spent countless hours in Starbucks to kill time and study - while, of course, consuming coffee. (I have an OG Gold Card, by the way, just to clarify that I wasn‚Äôt a mooch.)

I‚Äôd claim my little area and get in the zone. Naturally, after a while, nature calls. Since I was a regular and both the staff and other regulars knew me, I felt comfortable leaving my stuff for a minute or so. This was Manhattan, and most of my ‚Äútable guards‚Äù ranged from frail old men to socially awkward people. I never really expected anyone to physically protect my belongings if someone bold enough to walk in to a Starbucks and snatch a random MacBook came through: I always understood the risk of walking away from thousands of dollars in hardware and property. A familiar environment and the urge to urinate make you dumb.

All that to say, I recently stumbled upon a device that essentially bolts your laptop to the table. I‚Äôm sure there are plenty of variations, but it raised a question for me.

TL;DR
Working in caf√©s is already a debated topic, but what are your thoughts on bolting down a laptop so you can relieve yourself in peace? What would be your genuine initial reaction upon seeing someone with such a contraption? (Criticisms of all sorts are welcome.)

1jolm2x,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1jolm2x/im_spiralling_when_it_comes_to_dating_and_dont/,I'm spiralling when it comes to dating and don't know what to do,"(Sorry for the messy English, it's not my 1st language)  
  
About 8-9 months ago, I (19M) walked in on my then GF in bed with another guy. Needless to say, this one event (and the ensuing messy breakup) did a number on my mental health and it took me a very long time to get back to where I was. I went on a healing journey, picked up some hobbies, stayed consistent at the gym, and I tried to expand my horizons a little bit. All to make me a better person and with the goal of becoming more desirable. Don't get me wrong, I'm proud of my progress, but I was perfectly happy with the person I was before the breakup (Gym 5x a week, fluent in 3 languages, decent personality, etc.), so my main motivator behind further self improvement was finding a life partner. 

Now recently, I felt ready enough to start dating again. The apps were a complete disaster. Less than 10 matches total over 2 months (I tended to swipe right on 50% of profiles), with most either never responding or being bots/scammers. I did also go out and meet people, both through my hobbies (Rugby, book club, volunteering mainly), and at bars and clubs (usually went out with my friends on Fridays). I've always struggled to talk to women (really bad social anxiety and ADHD), so I never got anywhere at clubs and bars. I was able to give good impressions but I could never keep someone's attention before they got bored or moved on to the next guy. I had a bit more luck at the food bank I volunteer at and met this wonderful girl there. 

We hit it off really quickly. Turns out we share a lot of the same interests (she was also a big reader and had been interested in rugby), and she even had the same tastes as I did with both TV and books. It all really seemed too good to be true, but when we get comfortable with each other I asked her out for coffee. Things went really well, and we committed to a 2nd date. The 2nd date also went well and we started dating regularly. We really clicked and started dating regularly. I made sure to be myself, which she seemed to enjoy, and I didn't bring up anything too sexual unless the conversation prompted it. I felt like I may have finally found that happiness I was chasing with my ex, so I made plans to ask her to be exclusive on our 6th date. We made plans, and I paid for a reservation at a pretty nice restaurant. I also set up a small surprise at an overlook nearby where I'd pop the question.

I never got that far.

On the day, I texted her in the morning to make sure we were still on, and we updated each other throughout the day. Originally the plan was for me to pick her up and drive us, but she told me something came up and she'd meet me there. I guess this was the first red flag. I got to the restaurant, and I waited. I tried texting and calling, but 0 response. I waited until the restaurant called and told me they couldn't hold our reservation anymore, so I cancelled it, went home, and just cried for a very long time. I've been rejected, ghosted, and even stood up since I had started dating again but it never felt like actual betrayal before.

This was all 3 days ago and I don't think I've ever felt this lonely. At this point I've lost my motivation and only get out of bed to attend classes and get my homework done. I feel like some kind of freak, undeserving of love. I push everyone away, I did it with my ex, and now I've done it with this girl and I don't even know what I did wrong. She seemed fine earlier in the day but just dissappears later. We've met and hung out so many times. I just feel disgusted by myself. I thought I could handle failure but at this point it feels like a pattern with me as the common denominator. I feel pathetic getting this hung up over someone I wasn't even in a relationship with, and all the repressed memories from my past breakup have come rushing back.

I've started to resent dating, but there's nothing I'd hate more than to become that one guy who sits in front of his computer all day and blames women for all his misfortunes. I want to be better. I work on myself constantly in order to be someone I can take pride in, I work out 5 times a week and I'm proud of my current state. But whats the point of living this life if I've got no one to share it with? All my close friends rave about how awesome their partners are, and how great they feel as a couple, while all I could do was grin and bear it with the hopes that I would also find someone I could share that joy with, but not anymore. I'm so close to giving up and I just can't see the point of going thru all this effort when it results in nothing.

Sorry for the vent, but I'm just so frustrated, it seems that no matter what you do, something happens. Either someone funnier/better looking comes along, or they realize they're not ready for a relationship, or they find out I'm just plain ugly. I just wish I could at least know why.

What should I do? (4) Would admissions committees expect more research accolades or a more mature profile from someone who has taken an extra year, or is the timing less significant?

This story is also a surprise ficnapping. After planning everything out I realized if it would make a lot of sense if some of these characters were actually minor character made by u/Acceptable_Egg5560 and u/TheManwithaNoPlan. I asked Egg for permission and he gave the go-ahead.

Without further ado, here is my contribution to the MCP. This post is the story itself and this one {ADD LINK LATER} is an explanation **all** the references I packed into here. I hope you enjoy it.

# Prompt:

    Several years after the war comes to a close (can be canon or any au if you wish so) the galaxy has changed in many ways for the better or worse, while some are trying to recover what was lost the humans are now making their presence in space known more, even more after BoE and many refugees were sent to human-allied species, and so after a while a small documentary crew mostly made out of non-humans sets out to see how humanity has settled in many new worlds were they are now a pressesance in studying their living conditions be it in VP (Skalga), The Cradle, Coila, Leirn, Wriss, etc.
    How are their living conditions? How are they treated?, are they ‚Äúsafe‚Äù in their new home?, do they have it easier in some places than in others?

**Memory Transcription Subject: Anladowsky, Harchen Film Editor**

*Date \[standardized human time\]: October 17th, 2153*

I was trying to turn off the AI interpolation for higher frame-rates while the computer ran a diagnostic on the 1.2% slower-than-expected ping frequency and the thermostats on my overclocked GPU were at acceptable levels but not below ideal levels, yet the multicolored LED backlights for my custom computer-case kept changing and ruining my bedroom‚Äôs temperature so first I had to-

‚ÄúSon.‚Äù Ma‚Äôs voice snapped me out of my work. I turned my snout at her to focus with both eyes. ‚ÄúAre you almost done... setting up?‚Äù she asked me with a paw gesture at my desk.

‚ÄúAlmost. I just need to,‚Äù *-open BIOS and adjust the overclock degree-* ‚Äúfix a few more things.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, the video will start after then next commercial end and I think it looks fine now.‚Äù

I focused my eyes on the large computer monitor I brought back home from college. It was displaying the live-stream of my employer‚Äôs TV channel and the quality was‚Ä¶ actually pretty good, considering we were in a cabin in the middle of nowhere that only had a wired connection because Da personally installed fiber-optic cables for my 10th birthday.

I gave up my adjustments and joined Ma sitting on my bed. My old bedroom was just as I left it: blackout curtains on the bay window, my PC set covering up a quarter of the hardwood floors, a cabinet built from a felled tree overflowing with salvaged motherboards.

Ma look at me with one eye and asked, ‚ÄúIs everything okay, son?‚Äù

I sighed deeply and leaned forward. ‚ÄúCan you rub your claws on my back, like when I was a kid. Thanks Ma. I just want everything to be the best I could do for Pa.‚Äù I clutched and opened my paws a few times. ‚ÄúI got this job right after graduation and its my big break, but he just doesn‚Äôt get it.‚Äù Before she could correct me I added. ‚ÄúI know he supports me, and he know what this opportunity means for my career, but he doesn‚Äôt *get* it. He doesn‚Äôt watch a video and see the cuts, or the camera angles. Scene lighting, shot composition, blocking, none of it!‚Äù I dropped my paws on the bed. ‚ÄúHe just see a video, and none of the soul.‚Äù

Ma‚Äôs claws traced my spine, scratching an itch every Harchen needs another to scratch. I continued, ‚ÄúI just want this to be perfect. That he could see that I really tried and put everything I had into it. I put so much into this project and could spend hours talking about all the nuances, but what if he just doesn‚Äôt see it.‚Äù I felt a tear on my check. ‚ÄúI just want him to feel like I do.‚Äù

""He does, he really does. Just about different topics than you.""

""I know Ma. That's probably what makes it hurt most.""

I hear the faint click-clack of clawfalls in the hallway. I focused and changed from a saddeningly deep turquoise to a joyfully neon pink. Pa burst through the door carrying a family-sized bowl, his scales a solid light blue. Ma may be fooled into thinking he was excited, but I could tell the colors were too uniform to be subconscious. ‚ÄúSnacks are finally all ready! Don‚Äôt know why humans insist on selling their best movie-food with shells attached.‚Äù Pa joined us on the bed, sitting on my other side. He put the bowl of pistachios on my lap, but slightly closer to himself than Ma.

‚ÄúQuiet! Ma, the lights!‚Äù

The last commercial ended right as our time slot rolled in. First there was silence, then a short parental advisory and trigger warning were shown. After a few seconds, the recording production commissioned a local band to make of a [classical human song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5d7EbtLb8ok) started, and the opening I spent the last half cycle editing together for an underfunded documentary series rolled.

>Human: Hello  
Yotul: Hello  
Krakotl: Hello

The speaker changed with each word. First a human, then a Yotul, finally a Krakotl. At the same time I displayed historic footage of Governor Tarva standing in front of two humans in space suits; the moment she announced to Venlil Prime their newest allies.

When the drums came in the title card of the series held for a bar: ‚ÄúEverything You Touch, You Change‚Äù. The rock beat continued for several more bars with other instruments coming in, so I cut the credits in time to the music. This part lasted a bit longer than the original song to accommodate the main credits, but eventually the human started sing the first verse:

>Human: Build a ship, sent it off, we wanted to walk the stars

Three images flashed of humanity discovering FTL, building the Odyssey, and its launch.

>Human: Scared some friends, smoothed it out, the brave Venlil then risk it all

Next was a photo of Advisor Cheln passed out before the humans, Noah hugging Tarva as she cried, and her repaying the act by scaring off the Gojid fleet.

>Human: Exchange program, building bonds, but then a war rears its head

A human woman giving a class to UN troops on controlling their instincts, some tender moments from Beta Station, and then the Gojid craft carrying Marcel Fraser. As the music carried on without lyrics for a few moments, I faded through some close up of his injuries.

>Human: Came in peace and asked for allies in this brand new dark time

The diplomats who voted to ally with humans collected around the two shuttles on Aafa. Like all the shadow caste‚Äôs collected intelligence, this was publicly available now.

>Human: We did not stop looking, for a truth behind it all

I don‚Äôt know what deals production made, but they managed to get the actual footage of humans interrogating their first Arxur POW.

>Human: Can you tell us, is that what made us really special after all this time

Body camera footage of UN forces taking a captive human out of the Archive‚Äôs cyropods. To compliment the singer‚Äôs gentler tones for this line, the camera focuses on the dawning recognition on human‚Äôs face.

>Human: Once we believed our world was burnin‚Äô to the ground

The human‚Äôs voice strained as they cried out, while photos of the Battle of Earth flashed across the screen. All the photos were taken from ground-level, from people looking up at the space battle that could have ended their species.

>Human: Oh well, I guess we‚Äôre gonna find out

A single photo of Chief Hunter Isif and his soldiers landing outside New York City. All three singers delivered the next 2 lines in harmony.

>All: Let‚Äôs see how far we‚Äôve come

Six images with rapid cuts, in time to the beat:

A Dossur being carried down the street by a human

A human napping with his Yotul baby-brother and two Venlil pups

A Sivkit listening to their human husband playing the ukulele

A crayon drawing of a human father with his 4 Arxur children

A Yulpa daughter being taught to read by their human mother

A human eating lunch while wearing their Krakotl friend as a hat

>All: Let‚Äôs see how far we‚Äôll go

After the deluge of stimulation, a single image is held on screen for the entirety of this line. A single image to represent the central theme of first episode. It is a poster for Orphaned Stars, the UN‚Äôs agency for facilitating off-world adoptions. It was founded only 3 years after humans discovered FTL, and it is credited for humans having the highest interspecies adoption rate for 12 cycles running. It showed several non-human pups before a stylized sunrise, with a simple message across the top and contact information across the bottom.

>Human: So, you said we were weak and couldn‚Äôt hold our own

Footage of a Krakotl minister talking down to his Venlil subordinate, which would have been career ending in any good society but was instead the state-sponsored propaganda of the cripplers.

>Human: But now, we will rebuild from the bone

Naturally, I followed that scene of weakness with one of empowerment, so I cut to Venlil physical therapy class, with the instructor doing leg scissors to help fix their knocked knees.

>All: Let‚Äôs see how far we‚Äôve come

A carved club, found in by the first Venlil-lead archaeological exposition

The hidden library of White Hill University

A Venlil soldier with missing wool and a scarred face

A replica Skalgian firearm being crafted by a Venlil gunsmith

A department photo of the Blackriver Police Department

The opening ceremony of the first Venlil Olympics

>All: Let‚Äôs see how far we‚Äôll go

Time for one final image to symbolize the Venlil‚Äôs transformation. A military recruitment poster featuring a Skalga spec ops operative posing in full combat gear. The entire suit is black with mobile ear-covers, a wide face-plate to maximize peripheral vision, thick, ceramic plates along the chest and limbs, and flexible mesh for at the joins. Their tail is posed to draw the eye to the straight legs and functional knees.

I really hoped Da liked this next part. I could already feel my scales turn light blue around the snout.

>Yotul: Steam and steel powered the day, but we didn‚Äôt really know

The Yotul singer‚Äôs verse started with a painting of a Yotul port, with workers attending to many steamships and families enjoying the beach.

>Yotul: Feds would tear it all down for scrap in just a year or so

A photograph of the same location, shot from the same angle. The docks are now desolate, with the burned out husk of a half-sunken boat being the only thing close to the shoreline.

>Yotul: Started cryin‚Äô and who could stop themselves

I showed a news segment celebrating the melting down of the last locomotive on Mainland. In my periphery, I could see my father smolder a dangerous reddish orange.

>Yotul: Its time for running‚Äô, but there‚Äôs no where to run to

I used videos parents took of exterminators escorting a group of teenage Yotul, forcing them to walk during on their Running Day ceremony to prevent stampedes. What better way to emphasis the Yotul‚Äôs forced acceptance of their own debasement?

>Yotul: Sat down with my betben, we took a look around

Here was a wide shot of a Yotul ghetto in central Mainland. Pothole dot the road, the houses had faded and chipped paint, and trash-bags lined the street.

>Yotul: Said, ‚ÄúWhere we going‚Äô, man? You know the world is set for Denkin

I juxtaposed that poverty with an extremely low angle shot of a pristine and flawless Exterminator‚Äôs Hall.

>Yotul: Say your goodbyes if you‚Äôve got someone you can say goodbye to‚Äù

A daguerreotype of a Yotul family playing with their Hensa. A slight lighting change offscreen causes the image to shift from the positive to a haunting negative.

>Yotul: But humans told us to rebuild what was lost

I had to use the playbill for the Leirn-wide premier of the human play Hadestown, featuring a mixed cast of humans and Yotul. For some reason I couldn‚Äôt find the poster.

>Yotul: Can we? I guess we‚Äôre gonna find out

A rugged Yotul with tears on their snow-white muzzle holding a long-haired Hensa cub in the arms.

>All: Let‚Äôs see how far we‚Äôve come  
(Human: Right now)

A striped hat with a brass emblem

An abandoned steel-mill filled with rusted machinery

Several Yotul in a rundown bar drowning their problems

A team of Yotul rail-workers laying tracks alongside humans

A noble Yotul in a cloth mask overseeing the first test of the shield busters

A Yotul sitting behind the counter of a textiles shop

>All: Let‚Äôs see how far we‚Äôll go

The roasting room of Leirn‚Äôs largest coffee factory, 2nd largest in the galaxy. Dozens industrial-sized roaster fill the room, their 2 story high drums and matching pans were polished to a brilliant shine. The predominately Yotul workforce navigates mazes of walkways above and alleyways below the behemoths. The hop about with the confidence, coordination, and caution of people who have done a dangerous task thousands of times.

I knew what came next and wrapped my tail around Ma's to prepare.

>Yotul: Lightning, cutting, ice baths all came to an end

Images flashed across of stained electric chairs, filthy surgery suits, and rusted tubs with loops for restraints on the rim.

>Yotul: Now we will see how to truly mend

A Zurulian in scrubs getting hugged by a human child in a leg-cast.

>All: Let‚Äôs see how far we‚Äôve come (Human: Again)

A Venlil child with a notebook being strapped to a table

The infamous photograph of Tarlim the Exonerated being escorted to court in a neck-restraint

Zurulian Hospital Fleet members working with alongside Arxur to treat humans

A masked human and older Zurulian demonstrating medical equipment to a college class

An albino Gojid getting a saliva sample taken by a clearly nervous Zurulian nurse

A Zurulian administrating ‚ÄòCure‚Äô reversal treatment to a Gojid

>All: Let‚Äôs see how far we‚Äôll go

A Zurulian with a pink armband talking to a Venlil in a garden. The Venlil is tall with solid black fur and dark grey ears and is watering the plants as he talks. The distinct burn marks from a shock collar are clear on the Venlil‚Äôs neck, but he otherwise appears to be an average adult with a hobby. I remember overhearing two producers complain about how much that shot cost just in terms of compensating that Venlil, but the director kept insisting that an interview a violent PD patient was necessary.

Those thoughts left my mind when I noticed Ma stopped stroking my back. I turned my head to look at Ma, but she already camouflaged herself to be nearly invisible in the darkness of my room. The song entered the breakdown, but I didn‚Äôt care about any of that.

‚ÄúI am so sorry Ma!‚Äù I moved the bowl aside to get up and turn off the monitor ‚ÄúWe can stop watch-‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù She swiftly moved her hand to my shoulder and pushed me back into my seat. ‚ÄúI am safe here. I will ne-never go back. I am loved.‚Äù Ma repeated her old mantra again, softly. Da put his arm on my back and shifted to a comforting green. I settled back down and got ready for the Krakotl‚Äôs verse.

>Krakotl: It‚Äôs lies, lies, empire built on lies

To match the lower energy section, I had the images slowly faded into each other for the breakdown. First was the ‚ÄòPure Evil‚Äô exhibit banner, then Thydoron giving an interview on his Yotul *‚Äòdocumentary‚Äô*, and finally the root of the problem with the Farsul Archive‚Äôs logo.

>Krakotl: You wanted total control and there‚Äôs no way to hide

Horrific footage from the Leirn coup of a Krakotl exterminator beating the bound human ambassador with her flamethrower as a silent Gojid watches.

>Krakotl: That you made cruel, cruel, you made us so cruel

3 more images of exterminator cruelty against human; a man in a blue spacesuit standing before a Venlil, an emaciated woman on her knees before Zurulian in a train station, and a woman clutching her forearm as a Hanchen brandishes their baton.

>Krakotl: You tricked us into war, you tricked us as your fools

Nikonus had a sickeningly sweet expression as he gloated above a dry-heaving Captain Solvin.

>Krakotl: Now there‚Äôs dead, dead, just so many dead

Here I used orbital photos of Nishtal, the Gojid cradle and Fahl. These large scale but impersonal images sets up to contrast the horror that comes happens next.

>Krakotl: No help sent for our planet, no help for the cattle

Footage provided by the Collective of Arxur capturing their first cattle.

>Krakotl: But, there is hope, hope, we all still have hope

For a line about hope I obviously show footage of children born as cattle playing in a treatment facility. I could have cut between 3 facilities, but I needed to slow down even more as the music built tension, so instead I stuck to a single example.

>Krakotl: Now that the truth is out and we know what to do

I played a clip of the Nikonus and Giznel talking over comms in split-screen, so we could focus on both of the monsters at once.

>Krakotl: We can build each other up from the ruins

A beautifully framed shot of diplomats applauding after the unanimous vote to form the Sapient Coalition...

>Krakotl: But how? You are now gonna find out

...that was contrasted perfectly the dark and grimy shot of Kalsim sitting in a cell staring blankly at a holopad.

>All: Let‚Äôs see how far we‚Äôve come

A Krakotl starting a brawl after some species vote against human genocide

A Krakotl is a prestige exterminator‚Äôs dress uniform giving a speech to a pack hall

A Krakotl looking at a Colonel Gabreski holding a family photo

A Krakotl aiming a gun at a human‚Äôs head while a Yotul aimed a gun at her head

A Krakotl, probably too young to drink, speaking at a podium to a room of Gojid

A Krakotl handcuffing a Humanity First terrorist while her roughed-up, undercover partner watched

>All: Let‚Äôs see how far we‚Äôll go

A Krakotl and human officer inspecting mixed race platoon in UN garb. The platoon was mostly human, but some Venlil and Gojid could easily be picked out. Two Yotul wearing helmets bearing a red cross were also present. Both his scars and demeanor made it clear the Krakotl was a veteran many times over, although he walked abreast with the other officer.

>Krakotl: At first, pred versus prey got our world turned into glass

First was a picture of a mile-wide crater on the Gojid‚Äôs cradle, with no life in sight

>Krakotl: But then, learned the chain xzik-xzik to grass

Then I used a slide-wipe to show the same place now, a meadow filled with grasses and dotted with bushes tended to by Gojid and humans

>All: Let‚Äôs see how far we‚Äôve come (Human: Again)

A meadow with the sod disturbed in one rectangular area next to a tree

A rookie Gojid exterminator fleeing in terror from a mobbing crow

Two Gojid ecologists, a married pair, giving a presentation to their son‚Äôs class

A pendent with a symbol of 6 chains connecting to a central ring, resting in a Gojid paw

Humans soldiers and Gojid exterminators fighting off Arxur side-by-side

A Gojid and a human setting up a birdhouse on an apartment windowsill

>All: Let‚Äôs see how far we‚Äôll go

Two Gojid in a submersible, starring out at the depth of the cradles ocean for the first time. The camera is behind the two sets, so we don‚Äôt get shots of their faces. Still, their ears are flapping with excitement and their claws keep pointing out new discoveries that go past their window. Brilliantly painted fish occasionally swim by in a school of a dozen or so. Behind them is the a living forest of bioluminescent kelp, swaying and dancing with the currents.

It was time for the song‚Äôs outro, with the singers really stretching their voices to the limits. Right at my favorite part too.

>All: Let‚Äôs see how far we‚Äôve come

An episode of the show ‚ÄòThe Exterminators‚Äô feature on AI-generated Ambassador Williams

Fear-mongering posters warning Harchen about the human ‚Äòblood-lust‚Äô and ‚Äòpredatory-deceit‚Äô

A Harchen posing with his painting of a Venlil and human sitting tail-in-paw

A 5 piece band of mixed species preforming for a bar of humans while a Harchen backstage looks on

The opening screen for the video game depicting many Harchen and Farsul in an underwater complex

The scene for the very popular and still running pups‚Äô show Skalgan Squad

>All: Let‚Äôs see how far we‚Äôll go

We finally get to the image showing just how far Harchen media has progressed since the Fed‚Äôs dark age. A poster for last year‚Äôs blockbuster *Thilliar of Marhal* showed the titular Thilliar staring off in contemplation, huge about the movie‚Äôs title. His human side-kick was in silhouette in the lower left corner, raising his signature whip in defiance and challenge. Before him was the army of exterminators,  that Thilliar must outwit and outmaneuver throughout the movie. Only though his understanding of the terrain and ancient Harchen society can the hero rescue our heritage from those monsters who tried to burn it and ensure our slavery to a self-serving, colonialist power.

Getting all the clips for the next part was easily the hardest part of the project, but when I showed it to our Thafki sound-engineer she cried.

>All: Let‚Äôs see how far we‚Äôve come The First Wave was danced by Thafki on Aestus for a New Years festival

The Second Wave was danced by Thafki cattle, preforming in a large mud puddle/ their water supply

The Third Wave was a danced by Ambassador Kilitfu for a home video filmed by his giggling wife

The Fourth Wave was a danced by a River Wolf trying to gain serenity and calm before a mission

The Fifth Wave was a danced by a cattle-rescue on Lesser Sispa working through his rage

The Sixth Wave was a danced by a teacher for his class of pups, 3/4 Thafki and 1/4 human

>All: Let‚Äôs see how far we‚Äôll go

The grand finale  of the Seventh Wave, as preformed by Lillypad. The venue was a dock/viewing platform specially constructed at Ocean‚Äôs Breeze, Leirn for the occasion. Lillypad was wrapped in multi-colored cloths, appearing to be tied down and with no way to surface for air. She exhaled beneath the surface and let a blank look cross her eyes, an act so convincing, that some on the audience reported that they though her symbolic drowning became literal. I still feel on unsettling panic as I watch.

But there was little time to focus on that, as undoubted the most controversial part was about to begin.

>All: Let‚Äôs see how far we‚Äôve come

Chief Hunter Isif standing at the Sapient Coalician‚Äôs podium with a Dossur balanced on his head

A confident Arxur posing with a very long sniper rifle before a mountain of fluffy pillows

A nervous Arxur child with a damaged eye standing in an exterminator suit up to the neck

An awkward Arxur trying to smoke while watching a Nevok delivering a colony-wide announcement

A energetic Arxur child planting flowerbed after flowerbed by road on Wriss

>All: Let‚Äôs see how far we‚Äôll go

And finally, to truly encapsulate how the Arxur have demilitarized and become a peaceful people over the last 17 years, a photo of a human teaching Arxur philosophy. He stand at the head of a lecture hall filled with about 2 dozen college-aged Arxur. Although barely adults, any one would have easily been able to rip the humans head from his shoulders. Yet not a trace of fear or unease flick across his face. It was clear he was as comfortable teaching Arxur ethics as any other sapients.

>All: Let‚Äôs see how far we‚Äôll go

The final image to close out my contribution to the project was a family photo of the now retired Governor Tarva and Ambassador Noah. Their Venlil daughter was human son were each enjoying a game of ‚Äòuppies‚Äô with their parents. Smiles and tail-wags abounded where anatomy allowed.

The image held with the drumroll, but slowly faded out as the music died down. Today it revealed the title of the first episode: *Human Families*. Next week it will say *Venlil Strength* and after that *Yotul Industry*. Then will be *Krakotl Military*, *Gojid Ecology*, *Harchen Media*, *Thafki Dance*, and finally, *Arxur Disarmament*.

I turned toward Da. His scales weren't pastel purple from amusement, or pale white with surprise, or even a deep blue with embarreshment. Instead he was bright green with pride, with dashes of light blue with enjoyment. I suppose that is good enough.",4,1743475157.0,NatureofPredators,1,1.0,False

I met this girl at work and she is also 24. We really hit it off. There was obvious chemistry between us, and at some point, we ended up at her place after 2 days of going out. She mentioned a few times that her shoulders were hurting, which now I realize might have been a hint that she wanted me to make a move. But I didn‚Äôt do anything‚ÄîI just played it safe, and we ended up just sleeping.

Since then, things have felt different. She‚Äôs been more distant, taking hours to reply to messages, and at work, she doesn‚Äôt seem as comfortable around me as before. She even switched seats to sit away from me. But at the same time, she still bought me a coffee when I asked, so it‚Äôs not like she‚Äôs completely shut me out.

Now, I‚Äôm trying to figure out how to turn things around. I don‚Äôt want her to think I‚Äôm a pushover or that I wasn‚Äôt into her. I just need another chance to show her I‚Äôm not that guy, but I don‚Äôt know how to make it happen.

Could you please help me on how to win her?

P,S. I didn't make any move because I just had started to have a cold sore and I was not feeling good.

I have tried shimming and using the market technique but I can never get it close to perfect and then when I recheck it in the future the alignment has started to revert to being unaligned. I can taste this in the cup too! The first coffee after alignment usually tastes nice but a few cups later it starts tasting muddy.

I have only ever used the marker technique and aluminium shims. I‚Äôm willing to try other options but I don‚Äôt have enough money to buy a Lagom P64 yet.

I have bought a new top burr holder which helped a little and did change the alignment from the original top burr holder but it‚Äôs still off.

I‚Äôm just bored.  The grind is never ending.  At least when I was drinking it momentarily felt like there was a fun intermission.  Go out, have a couple of drinks at a bar, chat with some random folks, go home.  Harmless.  I fucking miss it.

Siting at home.  Two fingers of really great scotch.  Chat with spouse over the scotch.  One of the reasons I stopped drinking was to try to hit reset on some marriage issues but they‚Äôve just gotten worse. 

I can‚Äôt do it though.  That couple of drinks at the bar turns into getting totally wasted and lap dances at a strip club (which is just‚Ä¶ dumb, honestly, setting aside how my spouse would react).  The two fingers of scotch turns into multiple Irish coffees every Saturday and Sunday morning and other day drinking, not being present at all with my kid.

1jokz9u,https://www.reddit.com/r/BungouStrayDogs/comments/1jokz9u/shortish_rant/,Short(-ish) Rant,"‚ÄúAtsushi is the only reason Lucy is even involved with the ADA; she‚Äôs a satellite character!‚Äù

Erm, ackshually, Atsushi is the only reason Lucy knows the ADA is *innocent*, and her *quid-pro-quo mindset* was ‚Äì for a time ‚Äì the only reason she was involved with the ADA. ü§ì‚òùÔ∏è

~~Okay, no, but seriously-~~

Lucy is one of few characters who understands Atsushi on a fundamental level, simply by virtue of perceiving the heroism that belies his victimhood. She recognizes that [he bases his worth off of his ability to save people](https://i.imgur.com/Pfyzco6.jpeg) ‚Äì not as much as he used to, granted, but still. She doesn‚Äôt put him on an untouchable pedestal, say, the way Higuchi does Akutagawa or Teruko did Fukuchi. On the contrary, she's hyper-aware of his flaws, his reckless heroism above all. Not only is she [highly critical of his self-destructive habits](https://i.imgur.com/d4g2HNu.jpeg), she represents their antithesis: her very *introduction* posed a challenge to Atsushi‚Äôs hero narrative in the sense that, try as he might, he couldn‚Äôt save her, [only defeat her](https://tenseikizokunoisekaiboukenroku.com/images/ATHN6SuuC6dSA7XRK5SK1635822780.jpg). Conventional heroism ‚Äì the kind he used to save Ky≈çka, for example ‚Äì wasn't enough, and lo and behold, it wasn't his strength that got through to her, rather, [his vulnerability](https://i.imgur.com/OoOQhyK.jpeg).

The same goes for why [she defends him when the ADA is framed for terrorism](https://i.imgur.com/DO7yXhX.jpeg). It isn‚Äôt because, in her mind, Atsushi is a perfect being who can do no wrong. Unlike Aya, another non-law enforcement character who believes in the Agency‚Äôs innocence, Lucy‚Äôs rationale isn‚Äôt anything along the lines of ‚Äúhis virtues saved me, so he couldn‚Äôt possibly be bad.‚Äù It's because terrorism ‚Äì and by extension associating with other terrorists ‚Äì would *fly in the face of* Atsushi's reckless heroism. Y‚Äôknow‚Ä¶ the unit by which he measures his right to live? So in other words, Lucy advocates for the ADA because she understands Atsushi. Not because of her crush or even because she has innate faith in him (hell, we know she doesn‚Äôt). Because she understands him.

As for why she helps the ADA, at first it‚Äôs out of [a sense of indebtedness](https://i.imgur.com/JW90h6A.jpeg). Sure, so far only *she‚Äôs* been able to save Atsushi in the conventional sense ‚Äì [not vice-versa](https://i.imgur.com/ASJxylx.jpeg) ‚Äì but in the same way conventional heroism couldn‚Äôt get through to her where vulnerability could, everything she‚Äôs done for him pales in comparison to his ultimate act of compassion. What good is repeatedly saving Atsushi‚Äôs hide via Anne‚Äôs Room if [she can‚Äôt even comfort him properly](https://i.imgur.com/07mHpU3.jpeg)? So naturally, she tries to repay her debt. She goes searching for that elusive, commensurate act that will make her and Atsushi even. Ultimately, though, that search is flipped on its head. In the climax of the Sky Casino arc, Atsushi saves her from Nathaniel, and this sparks an epiphany: just as her care for *Atsushi* doesn‚Äôt depend on his being a *hero*, Atsushi's care for *her* doesn‚Äôt depend on her being *vulnerable*. They already *are* even.

Only once her feelings of debt are done away with does Lucy start helping Atsushi and the others because she *wants* to ‚Äì because [she really, truly cares](https://i.imgur.com/GNGBwFz.png). Not the artificial care that comes with repaying a debt, but the kind she showcases when she stays by Atsushi‚Äôs side after he faints, pressing a cold towel to his face. The kind that involves refusing to hurt Atsushi in any way, even to jog potentially vital memories. That‚Äôs when it becomes fair to say she‚Äôs doing it for Atsushi. Before that, she‚Äôs doing it because of her own personal struggle ‚Äì a struggle no doubt born of trauma. First she had to justify taking up space she had no choice in taking up via physical labor, then she had to justify keeping her surrogate family via successful missions; is it really any wonder she felt the need to justify her relationship with Atsushi? Her crush didn‚Äôt even factor in, save for the occasional blushy moment.

And that‚Äôs the thing: Lucy‚Äôs quid-pro-quo mindset is seen *primarily* in her relationship with Atsushi, *not* exclusively. [She asks for ‚Äúrepayment‚Äù from Fukuzawa in the Cannibalism arc](https://tenseikizokunoisekaiboukenroku.com/images/fgRFiPpt86b15jtLlb081635824480.jpg); she repays the caf√© owner for his kindness by keeping his coffee beans fresh in Anne‚Äôs Room; and she repays Ango for getting her out of hot water with the Division by agreeing to the infiltration plan. Atsushi is Lucy‚Äôs main dynamic, so naturally they share the most interactions, but her character doesn‚Äôt revolve around him. She has conflicts and goals of her own; he simply plays into them. Keep in mind, clearing the ADA‚Äôs name would also mean that she gets to go back to the caf√© ‚Äì to reunite with the caf√© owner and his wife and keep chatting with the Agency members during coffee breaks. She‚Äôs finally found a place to belong, and she wants to hold onto that. Why wouldn‚Äôt she?

March 20:

* I feel sick and notice that I can't smell my coffee. I DoorDash a COVID test, remember that I have one from a few years ago, cancel the order. Start getting ready for work, take the COVID test, and forget about it for like 30+ minutes. I look at it about 5 minutes before I need to leave and see that it's positive. Everyone shows up sick. Coworkers cough into their mouths. The test is old and has been sitting out for a while.¬† Those are things that I tell myself as I leave. That was massively irresponsible of me. Compartmentalization, justification, and being in denial won't excuse that. I was wrong.
* Larry calls me 5 minutes before I am supposed to be there, wondering where I am. He hangs up on me. I clock in on time, and he makes some comment that just irritated me. I was going to just be quiet (again stupid) and tell him about my COVID test. I told him I DoorDash‚Äôd a test. Dumb, very dumb. I figured being at delivery's mercy was smarter than admitting that I kiiiiinda took my time taking what I had at home. I was wrong here.
* About 45 minutes into my shift, he sends me home
* Larry wants confirmation of and a picture of the test. Which I found dumb because tests should not be read that long after being taken. In hindsight, I wish I had just sent a photo of it. I placed an Amazon order for new tests and let him know.
* He wanted a DoorDash receipt. I zoomed in on the order with my card info and canceled status being out, but name and test visible. I close the tab. He didn't like that it was zoomed in like that, and I opened a new tab and took another screenshot. He wanted the timestamp on it. I then called my PCP's office for a COVID test. While I was on the phone, I guess he texted me that he was en route to my home with a COVID test. After the call, I just closed my eyes and didn't see the text
* Larry called, and I picked up the phone to see who it was without realizing that I answered it. I know I went, ‚ÄúWhat the fuck do you want now?‚Äù and realized that the call was answered. He wasn't happy and didn't buy my explanation.¬† He was downstairs. I didn't invite him. I have never invited him to my home during my entire employment there.
* I went downstairs and opened the lobby door for Larry, who told me to take a COVID test in the apartment lobby with no surface to put everything down. He wanted the results that evening, not wanting to wait until the next morning.
* I dropped the test materials more than once. Neighbors are walking by me. I feel like a criminal with how Larry is treating me, I'm getting read the riot act, and during the waiting (it was not the full 10 minutes), the way Larry spoke to me was reminiscent of the crazy making behavior of a toxic relationship. I wish I had the presence of mind to record the conversation or have someone on the phone to listen to the conversation. It was not okay, but maybe I am just overly sensitive.
* Overall, this is a spectacle being made in front of my neighbors. I look at the test early, and note that it is negative. Larry is very mad and leaves,

March 21:

* COVID test from the clinic is positive. My PCP is out of the country and the office closes early on Friday, so I couldn't call about the note that said I tested positive for COVID on 3/20. I assume that was because it was the first day of the first positive test for quarantine/return to work purposes.
* I sent the letter to Larry via text and email.

March 22:

* The Amazon COVID test came back positive. I saved the second one.

March 25:

* I received a text from Larry that says: ‚ÄúCDC guidelines are 10 days so if you were planning to come in tonight or tomorrow do not, same for the weekend.""
* I took the second Amazon COVID test. Negative.
* The CDC website doesn't say 10 days. I called the hotline to confirm the current protocol.
* I figured I should just not argue about the guidelines because Larry probably wouldn't care anyway. I figured it lets the situation blow over.

March 27:

* Received an email from the owner:‚Äù ‚Ä¶You were immediately sent home by General Manager \[name\]¬† You were provided with a Covid Test and it was negative. ¬† You have missed subsequent shifts including Wednesday, March 27 and we have been informed that you have called out for your scheduled shift on Thursday, March 27.¬† We need an explanation as to why you have missed any scheduled shifts. ¬† Due to the unclear situation regarding your claim of having Covid we may require a Doctor clearance to return to work.¬† Please reply with your explanation and your ability to work as scheduled ASAP.‚Äù
* I explained and threw Larry under the bus by mentioning that he showed up ‚Äúat my home unannounced and uninvited‚Äù with the COVID test. I included the screenshots of the text conversation in the email along with my physician's note and information from the CDC. I stated that: ‚Äúto my understanding, it's acceptable to leave quarantine 24 hours after symptoms are gone and there's no fever. I've been feeling better since Tuesday and am able and willing to return to work.‚Äù

March 28:

* Radio silence from everyone since the email. I texted Larry to confirm that I am to stay home from work for the weekend.

March 29:

* Larry texts me back as I am about to walk in that I am to stay home. This was 9 minutes before my scheduled shift. Larry had over 10 hours to reply.

Today:

* I noticed that I am not scheduled for any work this coming week. The schedule for everyone else has been posted. I sent him the following: ‚ÄúI noticed that I am not scheduled for the upcoming week. Am I still employed?‚Äù That was over three hours ago.

Wisconsin is an at-will employment state, but this silence just strikes me as petty. It seems that my employment there is over, but I do not have enough saved up to cover my expenses while looking for another job, and without termination, I can't collect unemployment to help in the meantime. I do not want to take any action against what seems to be my former employer; I am just not sure what I *can* do. Should I just file for unemployment anyway?",0,1743474074.0,legaladvice,0,0.5,False

My inlaws have been awful since day one. Here are some highlights:

Hated our wedding venue, my shoes, and the hotel. Tried to demand my parents invite more of their friends, but refused to pay for the extra people.

Refused to pay for the rehearsal dinner because they ""never heard of such a thing"".

Refused to host an after wedding brunch for their family. My parents hosted.

They wanted us to have lunch with them on our honeymoon. Hell no.

Said that the college I went to was dumb.

Said that it was wrong I didn't have a lot of friends (I'm autistic).

Said people who don't change their last names to fit their husband are disgusting. (I, a person who has not changed my name was SITTING IN THE ROOM AT THE TIME)

Refused to help when they insisted visiting after I almost died having twins. We told them ""no visitors, only helpers"" but they still wanted to be served.

They have woken my kids up on purpose AT 10PM (they were 5 at the time) because we stopped at their house on the way somewhere and they NEEDED TO TALK TO MY KIDS ABOUT CAMP. They knocked on the car windows. 

They demand we keep stuff for them at our house. His dad has brought us coffee and sweeteners that we don't use...but he wants it stored at our house. He has a mug here, and a shoe horn. He demands soda even though we don't have it in our house. If he ever comes over and his things aren't readily available, he gets upset.

We gave them specific peanut butter that our kids love and doesn't have sugar added and is all natural, and they said it's hard to stir it, so they will feed them what they want when the kids are there 

His dad makes ""art"". We don't love it. He told us if we didn't hang it all he would be so upset. We hung 2 of the 3 in a corner of the house and he's upset every time he visits. He wants ALL THREE up where everyone can see them.

When I said I didn't want a summer job (I'm a teacher)
Because I was overwhelmed and stressed, he said I should quit my side hustles (that I love) so I can be with my kids more and have the summer job. 

Leaves the toilet seat up in our house even though we told him we had potty training children at the time. But also it's rude. I don't go to your house and leave things differently.

This year on new years day they told us they would like to have lunch with us. We said ""some other time"" as we have a family tradition for that day. They said they'd never been so hurt in their lives and we should have planned better if we wanted a day with just us. 

They send condescending emails. 

Insinuate that I make my husband do too much (we split things 50/50)

They criticized us for using ASL with the kids.

They've given Tylenol when we've said not to.

They won't let our kids say the word ""fart"" in their presence

They said girls whine more than boys.

When my husband had paternity leave he said it was a vacation.

They refuse to brush my curly kid's hair when she sleeps over because it ""wants to be wild"".

They demand hugs and kisses OVER AND OVER and even though I tell my kids they don't need to consent, they eventually do to appease them. 

One time they broke one of my favorite mugs and didn't offer to replace it.

They wanted us to visit them in their country home. We said sure, but we're going to make a stop to visit my cousin on the way who just got married and we wanted to drop off a gift. They got so angry that we would do something like that on ""their day"".

They say ""we see too many friends and family"" we should go to more museums.

We also apparently go to the farmer's market too much.

These examples are not even all of it. My husband says he's protecting me from ""so much more"". I've tried so hard to have a shred of affection for them, but I cannot. I keep pretending to be sick or napping, or too busy when they call or come over, but this is unsustainable. The kids love them. My husband loves them. I love my family. I'm in therapy. I just needed to share. 

Thank you if you've made it this far. ‚ù§Ô∏è

Oh, my moon, my stars, my entire solar system (which, admittedly, you could probably out-mass in a particularly heavy sweater), I write to you today with a heart heavier than a triple-layer chocolate cake, drenched in caramel and regret.

From the moment I first saw you, sauntering into the room like a majestic walrus gliding through an ocean of temptation, I knew my life would never be the same. Your footsteps, like the rhythmic drumbeats of destiny, sent tiny tremors through the Earth and colossal quakes through my soul. I was shaken, stirred, and possibly concussed by the sheer gravitational force of your presence.

Your laugh, oh that laugh! It‚Äôs like a symphony of joy, a melody so powerful it makes car alarms go off in a two-mile radius. It echoes through my dreams, haunting me like the ghost of a past meal I regretfully left unfinished. I find myself drawn to you as a man is drawn to an all-you-can-eat buffet‚Äîhelpless, hopeful, and slightly sweaty.

But alas, my love, there is sorrow in my heart, as deep and vast as the love you hold for stuffed crust pizza. I fear that society, cruel and unkind, does not understand the magnitude of your beauty. They see only the number on the scale, not the poetry in your curves, the artistry in your waddle, the sheer breathtaking spectacle of watching you chase an ice cream truck with the speed of a gazelle that has made peace with its limitations.

I love you, Alissa. I love you more than words can express, more than a child loves his first cupcake, more than you love extra cheese. And yet, I know that love is not always enough. The world may not be ready for our love, just as your chair was not ready for you that fateful day in the park.

Oh, my sweet, soft, gloriously rotund Alissa, I long to hold you, but I fear my feeble arms might collapse under the Herculean effort. I dream of dancing with you, but I also dream of not requiring orthopedic surgery thereafter. Life is cruel, my love, and fate is unkind.

If this love is doomed, then let me be the iceberg to your Titanic, the donut to your coffee, the last mozzarella stick that you hesitated before devouring. Let me be the one who cherishes you, even if from afar, like a man watching a cake through a bakery window, knowing it is too beautiful to ever be his.

With all the love and sorrow in my heart, Forever yours (if you‚Äôll have me), A Hopelessly Smitten Fool

I'm visiting Chicago for work and decided to come a couple days early to do some sightseeing as I've never been here before, and after doing some research, this was the itinerary I came up with. My main goals are trying famous Chicago food and seeing as much as I can in 2 days. I'll be staying in Mag Mile and would appreciate any thoughts!

Friday

- Land in ORD at 5, hotel by 6

- Go to lou malnati‚Äôs for dinner to try deep dish pizza (sausage personal pie)

- check out navy pier

- check out spybar (gotta listen to house music in the birthplace of house music)

Saturday

- Basically do a loop of the north loop

- riverwalk -> The warehouse -> the green at 320 -> get italian beef at luke‚Äôs italian beef and fries -> fountain -> bean park area -> cultural center -> lakeshore park -> hot dog + pizza puff at jimmy‚Äôs gyro -> wendella boat tour

- Boat tour at 7:45

- maybe hit a bar somewhere and have a shot of malort

Sunday, June 15

- start with chicago 360

- Get lunch at henry caray for chicken vesuvio

- Ride the lakeshore trail (use divvy) to hyde park and explore the parks there + UChicago
    - institute for the study of ancient cultures
    - promontory point for picture
    - jackson park (Garden of the Phoenix, yoko ono sculpture)
    - japanese garden
    - medici for coffee

- Bike to the jibarito stop from hyde park for dinner

- Andy‚Äôs Jazz Club for reservation at 8, ends at 10 pm

    - Also considering other jazz clubs like winters jazz or jazz showcase in mag mile

Is this itinerary doable, and are there things that aren't worth hitting in my list/things I'm missing and definitely should hit? I'm pretty open to changes since the boat tour is the only thing set in stone atm.

I went through an almost 5 year long abusive relationship, both physically and mentally. It was rough and I didn't have anyone to confide in at first. I started working with this guy who was goofy and just my type and immediately had a crush on him. We worked together almost daily and discovered we had a lot in common, so we became quick friends. Eventually, I learned that he had previously been through a similar relationship, and he was the only person I felt safe to tell about the abuse. He always listened and never judged me, but frequently reminded me how wrong it was. He even made a few comments to my ex about how he was a POS for treating me the way he did. He's a cool guy who respects women and has many platonic female friends. I've considered him my best friend for a long time. Both of us were in relationships for the first 3+ years of our friendship. I did tell him I had feelings for him, joking I knew something would happen between us eventually. I was young (19, now early 20s) and regret my forwardness now considering he wasn't single at the time. But he was very respectful of his gf at the time and always brushed/laughed me off which i honestly really respected and still do. 

After my ex left, his ex broke up with him a few months later. We live a few hours apart, and the first time we saw each other while both single, I jokingly suggested a date. We had coffee and ran errands and I asked to kiss him. He said he ""doesn't kiss on the first date"" lol so I left. But told him I was planning to kiss him the next day, since we had planned to go drinking with some more friends. The next night was seriously like something out of a movie. We went to a club, and while dancing I started holding his hand. Throughout our friendship we were never physically affectionate, only hugging once before. So this was super exciting lol. We eventually kissed, and I cannot even explain how magical it felt for me. I felt so excited yet so safe and calm with him. We kept drinking and one thing led to another if you know what I mean haha. 

Flash forward to now and it has been almost 7 months. We went on a spontaneous vacation, so many concerts, and multiple small weekend trips. I met his family, and he met mine. He told me he loves me at the start of this year. I have genuinely never been so happy in my entire life. I fell in love with him so quickly and it gets stronger every day. I finally am growing confidence in myself, and he encourages me to push myself to grow in ways that feel scary sometimes. We spend as much time together as possible. I feel like I have the opportunity to have a family and give my kids the loving home I never got to have. I cant even tell you how perfectly imperfect this man is. He's goofy, an asshole in a lighthearted funny way lol, he cooks for me and takes me out and listens to my feelings. He often shows his love in a way that's unspoken yet undeniable. Even though he still tells me every so often:) 

I never thought this was possible. I faced so much hurt and disappointment that I expected my life would only continue to be this way. Now, I'm working on myself and my career as we talk about getting a house together. We share our favorite hobbies and music and every day with him is like hanging out with my best friend. I could not be more grateful. I hope everyone finds a love like this. And I promise it is truly possible<3

TLDR: I am now dating my best friend of almost 4 years. We got together about 7 months ago, and I have truly never been happier. It feels like something out of a fantastical love story in a movie or book and I feel so lucky.

**What Is Sexual Communication - David DeAngelo All About?**

If you've ever felt like you're missing some secret code when it comes to attracting women, you're not alone. **Sexual Communication - David DeAngelo** is a course designed to teach men the hidden language of attraction. It‚Äôs not just about pick-up lines or surface-level confidence; it‚Äôs about understanding the deep-rooted psychological and biological cues that create real attraction.

**Who Is This Course For?**

Whether you're a complete beginner struggling to create chemistry or someone who wants to refine their approach with women, this program has something to offer. If you've ever wondered why some guys effortlessly attract women while others are stuck in the dreaded friend zone, this course claims to have the answers.

**Why Should You Care About Sexual Communication?**

Most men go their entire lives never truly understanding what turns women on‚Äîbeyond just looks or money. **Sexual Communication - David DeAngelo** teaches how to:

* Use body language, tone, and eye contact to instantly trigger attraction.
* Create **sexual tension** (a must for deep chemistry).
* Avoid the common mistakes that kill attraction.
* Flirt without coming across as creepy.
* Get women to take the lead in advancing the interaction.

**What Will You Learn?**

This course goes deep into **how women perceive attraction** and how to communicate in a way that resonates with them. Some of the key takeaways include:

* **How to appear confident, smart, and sexually attractive** in the first three seconds‚Äîwithout saying a word.
* **Why women aren‚Äôt attracted to ‚Äúnice guys‚Äù (wussies) and what to do instead.**
* **How to flirt effectively** so women feel intrigued and drawn to you.
* **19 traits of highly attractive men** and how to showcase them naturally.
* **16 Power Lines**‚Äîword-for-word phrases that trigger attraction instantly.
* **How to escalate physically without making her uncomfortable.**

**Where Can You Apply These Techniques?**

One of the best things about this program is that the techniques can be used **anywhere**‚Äîwhether at a bar, in a coffee shop, at work, or even online. The principles of attraction don‚Äôt change based on location, and once you understand them, you can apply them effortlessly in any setting.

**When Will You See Results?**

Many men who take the course report seeing changes **immediately**. Simply becoming aware of what they‚Äôve been doing wrong (and making small adjustments) leads to noticeable improvements in how women respond to them. Long-term mastery, of course, takes practice, but the framework DeAngelo provides can create quick wins almost instantly.

**How Does It Compare to Other Dating Advice?**

Unlike generic dating tips, **Sexual Communication - David DeAngelo** focuses on **deep psychological attraction** rather than gimmicks or temporary tricks. It‚Äôs about transforming how you communicate‚Äîso you naturally become more attractive rather than faking confidence or using corny pick-up lines.

**Final Thoughts ‚Äì Is It Worth It?**

If you're tired of guessing what works and what doesn‚Äôt when it comes to attraction, **Sexual Communication - David DeAngelo** provides a step-by-step approach to mastering the language of sexual attraction. Instead of going through trial and error for years, this course offers a shortcut to understanding **how attraction actually works**‚Äîand how to use it to your advantage.

So, is it worth it? If you're serious about improving your success with women, this course is **absolutely worth checking out.**",1,1743472929.0,RobaLearning,1,1.0,False

I work for a small business of a few employees. I recently discovered after catching covid that our sick day policy is to simply pay time off in advance on every paycheck, causing all days off to be ""unpaid days off"" instead. I was told this was legal in Washington State.

I took Monday, March 17th off as a sick day. That day I was informed of the sick day policy structure. 

On Wednesday, March 19th, I told my employer I would be taking Friday and Monday off due to continued sickness. I advised them of this verbally and noted it in our time tracking application. 

The job application was then posted at around 10:30 PM the night of March 19th. I was at no point advised of this. 

Today I was informed by a friend that the position was posted and confronted my employer about it. They replied that I was ""performing at about 70%"" 

Would the timeline they posted that position be considered retaliatory? I understand in Washington State that being fired for taking ***paid*** sick leave is considered retaliatory. But there's no documentation that I can find about ""unpaid"" leave due to our interesting pay PTO structure. 

Additionally, some of the reasons the employer cited for wanting to replace me feel extremely questionable?

The two most prominent are that

- I had previously ""left early"" to return Amazon items purchased for the business. Specifically the comparison was drawn that ""[your coworker] can just do it after work because he doesn't care"" 

 - That I use break time to leave the premises and purchase coffee from across the street

These two things don't seem like behaviour that an employer can cite as rationale for termination?",0,1743472793.0,legaladvice,0,0.5,False

My birthday is this week. Not a big one, just turning 28--but I love any excuse to spend a day with my two closest friends! We've never paid for one another's food or coffee when going out for birthday's and I've never expected that, so it is simply time spent together going to our favorite places, which is what I enjoy the most anyway. 

  
One of these friends (K) doesn't care too much about her own birthday, but does appreciate it when it's remembered--two years ago, while we were living out of the state, I sent her a gift and a heartfelt message. This last year, I threw her a little surprise birthday party and we all pitched in to get her this one thing that she has been wanting for a few years but couldn't afford. She thanked me endlessly for planning the party and for the gift. While we were out of state, I changed my flight plans and flew up 11 days early to spend time with the other friend (A) and celebrate her birthday (I was going to be flying up with my husband for my brothers wedding) because I know how much birthday's mean to her. She has expressed how important they are to her many times since we've all been friends, which is over 10 years at this point. I spent hours on my feet (which is painful and difficult for me due to several disabilities) helping her prep for her birthday--I even expressed that I was sorry for not getting her a gift but I couldn't afford it due to coming early (which meant eating out A LOT because that's what she likes to do, and I was okay with that, but 11 days of eating out...) and she assured me that she was just so happy that I was there. 

  
Now...onto my birthday. I have always \*always\* had to tell them when my birthday is coming up and that I would like to celebrate, despite the fact that they know I love celebrating my birthday, and I often drop obvious hints about the upcoming day in case they've forgotten the date, to see if either of them will hit me with a ""We should all hang out for your birthday!"" or literally just anything. This week, on BeReal (which they both check religiously and only have a few friends on) I posted a picture of my calendar which I was filling in for the upcoming month, and on my birth date I of course wrote \*\*Stephanie - birthday!\* And made sure that it was fairly zoomed in. Okay okay, maybe too subtle? So, let's be more obvious--I sent them a message with some pictures of stuff I'd bought (these items were relevant to a hobby we share) and said, ""So uh...as a little birthday present to me, I may have bought just a \*few\* things (insert ""hehe"" emoji here)."" 

  
Nothing. Not an, ""Oh my gosh, I forgot your birthday was already here!"" or ""Speaking of your birthday, we should plan something!"" 

  
We've been friends for over \*ten. years...\* Is it too much to ask that my friends put my birth date in their calendar (you can even set an event to ""repeat every year"")? Or plan \*one damn birthday\* instead of me planning it myself? I'm not asking for some surprise party, or gifts, I just want my friends to put in the same amount of effort for me that I do for them. Not that I expect gifts, as I mentioned, but they both make a lot more money than I do, and know that gifts are one of my love languages (giving and receiving) and neither of them have bought me a gift \*or even made me a card\* in over 3 years. I'm not even hard to please--I like soft blankets, candles, Squishmallows and Sanrio, books (we do our own little ""book club"" twice a month and they have access to the ""want to read"" list on my Goodreads; I've even sent them pictures of my book case recently). One time A made me a handmade card that had a little effort put into it and I cherished the hell out of it, and ooh'd and aww'd about it for weeks after. 

  
I'm sure I'm being overdramatic...but I can't help but feeling forgotten and unappreciated. Feel free to reason with me, but please just be kind, because I have already been fighting tears the past two days. 

  
I don't know if I should kindly bring it up to them or if I'm just being silly and immature. We've all always been very open and receptive to gentle criticism or ""hey, this hurt my feelings"" kind of talks, but I fear I am only acting childish and shouldn't bring it up. 

  
I'll probably delete this later, lol! Idk...does anyone feel the same way, and also have conflicted feelings about it?",4,1743472216.0,AuDHDWomen,1,1.0,False

---------------------------------------------------------------

The coffee industry has long been ruled by traditional brews and specialty blends. However, a new wave of innovation is taking hold as functional beverages emerge to reshape coffee consumption trends. Consumers are increasingly seeking drinks that not only provide a caffeine boost but also deliver added health benefits. This shift is paving the way for a remarkable transformation in how coffee lovers define their daily brew.

Functional beverages are designed to go beyond mere hydration, combining ingredients that offer various health advantages. Some popular types include coffee infused with adaptogens, superfoods, and vitamins. These enhancements are proving attractive to health-conscious consumers who are looking for more than just their morning cup of joe. The rise of these beverages is significantly impacting how people interact with coffee.

### Consumer Preferences are Changing

Today's consumers are more informed about their choices and increasingly interested in products that promote wellness. As a result, coffee brands are adapting to meet these evolving preferences. Here are a few impacts functional beverages are having on consumer habits:

- **Health-Conscious Choices:** With a greater focus on health, many people are opting for functional coffee that includes added nutrients like vitamins B and C, antioxidants, and amino acids.
- **Increased Demand:** There is a growing market for practical beverages that can help with stress relief, focus enhancement, and energy boosts. Matcha lattes and CBD-infused brews are just a few examples.
- **Diverse Flavors:** Functional coffees often come with unique flavor profiles, appealing to adventurous consumers who want an experience beyond traditional coffee.

### Innovation in Product Development

The coffee industry is seeing an explosion of creativity as brands innovate to keep up with consumer demand. Companies are developing new blends that combine coffee with various functional ingredients. Some trends include:

- **Adaptogens:** Ingredients like ashwagandha and reishi mushrooms are being added to coffee to help reduce stress and enhance mental clarity.
- **Protein Infusions:** Many coffee drinks now feature added protein, making them suitable for people seeking a quick meal replacement or post-workout refreshment.
- **Probiotic Coffee:** Brands are infusing coffee with probiotics, allowing consumers to enjoy the benefits of gut health while savoring their favorite beverage.

This innovative spirit extends beyond just the product itself. Coffee shops are revamping their menus to feature functional options, highlighting the health benefits that accompany each drink. For instance, a simple coffee can be transformed into a powerful elixir with the addition of specific ingredients tailored to various health needs.

### The Rise of Ready-to-Drink Coffee Beverages

Ready-to-drink (RTD) coffee beverages are experiencing significant growth in the market, fueled by the popularity of functional drinks. Consumers appreciate the convenience of grabbing a cold brew from the fridge that not only offers caffeine but also enhances their well-being. Whether enriched with collagen, herbal extracts, or energy boosters, these beverages cater to on-the-go lifestyles.

You may encounter variants that contain:

- **Brain Boosters:** Coffee infused with nootropics aims to enhance cognitive function.
- **Detox Ingredients:** Some drinks include charcoal or lemon to promote detoxification.
- **Hydration Aids:** Functional ingredients such as coconut water provide hydration along with your coffee fix.

### The Market Potential

The surge in demand for functional beverages has created substantial market opportunities for coffee producers. Brands are capitalizing on these trends by not only introducing new products but also investing in marketing to convey the benefits of functional coffee. With sales growth for these products projected to rise, coffee companies have a chance to reach a broad consumer base eager for healthier options.

As functional beverages continue to revolutionize the coffee industry, the traditional coffee experience is evolving. From health benefits to innovative flavors, consumers are set to enjoy exciting options that cater to their varied lifestyles and preferences. This eclectic mix of coffee and health is more than just a trend; it's reshaping the future of how we consume coffee.

The dynamic nature of the coffee market, driven by functional beverage trends, indicates that we are on the brink of a new era. Expect to see more coffee shops and brands investing in this innovative approach, leading to even more exciting options for coffee lovers around the world.

Health Benefits of Combining Coffee with Functional Ingredients
---------------------------------------------------------------

Coffee is one of the most popular beverages worldwide, but its potential goes beyond just waking you up. With the rise of functional ingredients, coffee is evolving into a health powerhouse. Combining coffee with nutritious elements can enhance its benefits and contribute to overall well-being. Let's explore the health benefits of integrating functional ingredients into your daily coffee routine.

### Enhanced Energy and Focus

When you add functional ingredients like adaptogens or MCT oil to your coffee, you can experience a significant boost in energy and mental clarity. These ingredients have unique properties that complement coffee's natural caffeine, creating a balanced and effective energy source. Here are a few benefits:

- **Adaptogens:** Herbs like ashwagandha or rhodiola can help your body manage stress. This combination allows for sustained energy without the jitters.
- **MCT Oil:** Medium-chain triglycerides provide fast energy that supports brain function, making your coffee not just a pick-me-up but also a brain booster.

### Improved Digestive Health

Adding functional ingredients such as cinnamon or collagen to your coffee can promote better digestion and gut health. Cinnamon is known for its anti-inflammatory properties and can also help regulate blood sugar levels. Collagen, on the other hand, supports the gut lining, enhancing nutrient absorption. Together, they transform your regular cup of joe into a digestive aid.

### Support for Immune Function

Ingredients like turmeric and ginger into your coffee can provide additional immune support. Turmeric contains curcumin, renowned for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. Ginger can help with digestion and reduce the risk of infections. Combining these with coffee makes a powerful blend to strengthen your immune system.

### Better Mood and Emotional Balance

The addition of functional ingredients like cacao and maca to coffee can enhance mood and cognitive function. Cacao is rich in flavonoids, which can improve mood and decrease stress levels. Maca root is known for its hormone-balancing properties, which can help reduce anxiety and enhance emotional well-being. Together, they create a coffee experience that not only wakes you up but also uplifts your spirits.

### Weight Management Support

If you're looking to manage your weight, functional ingredients like protein powder or green tea extract can be beneficial when mixed with coffee. Protein helps to keep you full longer, reducing unnecessary snacking. Green tea extract can increase your metabolism, providing an extra boost to your weight loss efforts. Enjoying coffee with these additions can be a delicious part of a balanced approach to weight management.

### Antioxidant Boost

Combining your favorite coffee with berries or chia seeds can significantly amplify the antioxidant capacity of your drink. Berries are powerhouses of antioxidants that combat oxidative stress and promote heart health. Chia seeds add omega-3 fatty acids and fiber, making your coffee not just healthy but also richer in texture.

### Hydration and Detoxification

Additions like lemon juice or electrolytes can transform coffee into a refreshing hydration source. Lemon juice adds a zesty flavor while providing vitamin C, which aids in detoxification. Electrolytes help replenish minerals lost throughout the day, especially if you enjoy your coffee as part of an active lifestyle. This approach can keep you hydrated and ready to take on whatever life throws your way.

### Creating Your Perfect Coffee Blend

You don‚Äôt have to be a nutritionist to create your ideal coffee blend. Start with your favorite coffee base and choose one or two functional ingredients based on your personal health goals. Experimenting with flavors and textures can lead to delightful discoveries.

Next time you brew your cup of coffee, think about how you can enhance its benefits with functional ingredients. The combination of these health-boosting elements with your morning ritual can pave the way for better health and vibrant living. It‚Äôs not just a drink; it‚Äôs a lifestyle choice, empowering you to nurture yourself with each sip.

### Conclusion

The rise of functional beverages is reshaping how we view coffee, blending tradition with innovation. As consumption trends shift, more coffee lovers are looking beyond the mere caffeine kick. They seek beverages that offer enhanced health benefits, such as improved energy levels, better digestion, and boosted immunity. This creative fusion has not only diversified our coffee options but also encouraged consumers to prioritize their overall wellness while enjoying their favorite brew.

Combining coffee with functional ingredients like adaptogens, vitamins, and superfoods opens up a world of possibilities. These ingredients not only complement the rich flavors of coffee but also provide consumers with added nutritional value. Whether you‚Äôre sipping on a mushroom-infused latte or a protein-packed cold brew, these functional beverages allow you to tailor your coffee experience to better suit your health needs and lifestyle.

As awareness of the health benefits associated with functional beverages continues to grow, we're likely to see further changes in coffee consumption patterns. People are more inclined to try new flavors and recipes that resonate with their wellness goals. The coffee industry is responding with innovative products that not only offer a delightful taste but also serve specific health purposes. In this dynamic landscape, coffee is no longer just a beverage; it has evolved into a tool for wellness. As you explore these options, you‚Äôll find that the coffee cup in your hand can power both your productivity and your health.

For context, we have known each other for several years now. We‚Äôve always had an interest in each other but never actually dated. She would even text me that she missed me over the years but it never materialized into anything. We recently reconnected over videos I found from years ago of us just talking and having fun. We had a good, engaging conversation after that. 

I got the confidence to ask her to meet up. Here‚Äôs how it went:

Me: Would you be interested in going to get some coffee and catch up sometime? I heard the *business name* is good. 

Her: yeah I‚Äôd love to

Me: Awesome. When are you free?

Her: um I‚Äôm not sure I work all weekend and the rest of this week

Me: That‚Äôs no problem because I‚Äôll be out of town over the weekend. How‚Äôs Monday at 12:30 sound?

Her: I‚Äôm gonna have to see what my schedule is like they should post it this weekend sometime 

Me: Ok no rush. Just lmk and we‚Äôll find a day and time. 

Her: okay:)

That was the beginning of this week. She barley talked to me over the week, even going as long as two day without answering. I get that she has a life too and is not obligated to talk to me all the time. It is just out of character. The weekend has now gone by and she still has not got back with me to set up a date and time to meet. What should my next move be? Wait for an answer?

In other words, welcome to the SEC Invitational where, no joke, 14 out of their 16 teams occupy the field. My God, its spreading to beyond Baseball and Football. Anyway, here are your victims.

**First Four**

St Francis PA

Nice that St Francis made it back to the tournament after 35 years of waiting (the one in a town in the middle of redneck Pennsylvania, not Brooklyn). The first game of March Madness did not disappoint. St Francis had the lead all game, but a comeback from Alabama State in the 2^(nd) half would lead to a tie. Then what followed was one of the sloppiest finishes in recent memory in the tournament. With milliseconds to spare, Alabama State would put in the game-winning Hail Mary lay-up. This was the first ever March Madness win for this HBCU school. Great performance nonetheless from Saint Francis, as they went in this game with a losing record. Where are they in Pennsylvania again?

\*Update\* This has become somewhat of a tragedy. A week removed from playing in the tournament, St Francis is going to Division III due to financial reasons come 2026. A few other smaller Division 1 schools are having similar discussions. But this is a damn shame for a program who waited 35 years for their moment only to pull the plug shortly after. The landscape is changing and there is nothing in our power that we could do.

San Diego State

UNC is somehow in. A team that only had 1 win against Quad 1 opponents. I call absolute conspiracy. Bubba Cunningham must have slipped MJ‚Äôs secret stuff into everyone‚Äôs coffees at the negotiating table. UNC is being sent out to slaughter all for Cunningham‚Äôs personal gain of at least $104,000. This bullshit has gotten to the point where the West Virginia governor is suing the NCAA because the Mountaineers are the first ones out. Like they give two shits about losing to last-place Colorado in the conference tournament. I felt Indiana was more snubbed because they actually got their shit together at the end of the season. So yeah, UNC is in this tournament, much to the dismay of literally everyone else. ‚ÄúI hope San Diego State fucking destroys them‚Äù they said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre frauds with a capital F‚Äù. They may be frauds, but they‚Äôre still blue bloods. And when there is a sliver of leeway, UNC takes it with authority. To the tune of 61% shooting in the first half. Look on the bright side, Aztecs. At least it wasn‚Äôt UConn this time. Lamont Butler sends his regards.

You know what is actually the funniest thing about the situation? Indiana took West Virginia‚Äôs head coach! HAHAHAHAHAHA!

American

Pretty damn symbolic that American University, a college in D.C. that is currently in the Patriot League, would lose in the First Four. Make it make sense, America. Matt Rogers deserves better.

Texas

I need a little brush-up on my grammar. According to the internet, Xavier‚Äôs X is pronounced silent as its original pronunciation is from the Basque region. That‚Äôs kind of why Xavier adopted the Musketeers nickname as well. Well I say these rules have been changed. You get to keep your X, Xavier. Xavier would come back from its largest deficit all season to silence Texas. Oh yeah, Texas also has an X in its name. And because they went quiet in the 2^(nd) half, I‚Äôm gonna treat Texas‚Äô name as such (this ONLY applies to UT-Austin). From now on, Texas will be pronounced as ‚ÄúTejas‚Äù, which actually is the correct pronunciation in Spanish.

It really was the end all be all for Tejas. Head coach Rodney Terry has been told to fuck off.

**First Round**

Louisville

Louisville got absolutely screwed by the committee. Louisville was in the Top 10 after the ACC Tournament and yet they slid to an 8^(th) seed. And worse, they have to play at their biggest rival‚Äôs arena in Lexington. They faced an equally underrated Creighton squad who absolutely kicked the ever-loving shit out of them. I mean I know Pat Kelsey never had a tournament win so far, but I would‚Äôve expected at least SOME competitiveness from him. Foolish of me to not take into account Creighton‚Äôs experience in the tournament. And the fact that Kalkbrenner is still on the team. Disgraceful performance. Unless Louisville does win in the tournament, I will not trust them from here on out. I expected A LOT better from you, Cards.

High Point

Welcome back everyone to the Purdue Invitational! Where we get to see up-and-coming loser programs try to take down the giant. Up first in our 2025 edition is High Point, a team that is making its tournament debut. High Point‚Äôs athletics department went out of its way to buy tickets and travel for more than 200 students. High Point lived up to the hype most of the game. It is kind of ‚Äúreturn-to-form‚Äù for Purdue that they play down to their level. With Zach Edey gone, much of their defensive leverage is gone. But alas, the wish we grant sometimes cannot be fulfilled. Purdue holds on in the 2^(nd) half to avoid humiliation for one more year. Thanks for playing, High Point. It allowed us in the short time you‚Äôre here to ignore the fact that your city makes furniture for a living.

Montana

Wisconsin was another team that had trouble in the first half but made their getaway in the 2^(nd) half. They leave Montana in the wilderness of a first-round exit.

Southern Illinois-Edwardsville

SIUE would make their tournament debut. Their head coach Brian Broome made it possible by storing a special pair of scissors until they cut the nets when they would win the Ohio Valley Tournament. The 7-year wait would be over. If they got another pair of scissors for beating a first-round opponent, sorry to say for SIUE that that encasing might never be opened. Not with opponents like Houston whipping your asses.

Alabama State

50 miles separate Auburn and Alabama State. The same could be said for the pregame spread for this game. At least they didn‚Äôt lose by that much. Positive?

Clemson

Sometimes the way teams compete in March Madness is unexplanatory. Nothing more could be said about Clemson. How the FUCK that this team, who went 18-2 in the ACC and made it to the Elite 8 last year, would score only 13 points in the first half?! TO MCNEESE STATE?! McNeese last year was the only team I picked for an upset in the first round. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, I get an appointment to get my eyes gouged. The tragic thing was Clemson did show up in the 2^(nd) half. But their shortcomings were too far to overcome in the end. Clemson and Louisville, the two ACC teams that everyone likes, are both gone. And just like that, millions of brackets are scrapped in unison.

And NOW they‚Äôre saying that Will Wade is dipping McNeese to become the next head coach for NC State after the tournament! Clemson fans, welcome to hell.

VCU

Almost forgot that the Atlantic 10 existed. BYU knew the score immediately. Former Utah State coach Ryan Odom coaching your opponents? Murder them on live television. Fitting way to get BYU‚Äôs first tournament win in a decade.

Georgia

Shocking. An SEC team with a losing record in conference turns out to be a massive fraud despite their relative seeding. This was a 1^(st) round KO in the bluntest of ways. A 15-0 start from Gonzaga is a deficit few could recover from. Especially against the almighty Zags. Bulldogs beat Bulldawgs. And Bulldawgs beat themselves \*speeding tickets\*.

Wofford

Congrats Wofford! You‚Äôre the last team from South Carolina still in the bracket after Clemson‚Äôs agonizing upset. Your reward is getting torched by 2^(nd) seeded Tennessee. Moving on.

Kansas

From the moment this was announced, I knew this was the game to watch for the first round: Kansas vs Calipari‚Äôs Arkansas. Calipari teams have a habit of choking recently. But Kansas is living it right now. The Jayhawks were #1 preseason and yet they are a 7 seed. The game lived up to the billing with a close game throughout. But Kansas potential was lost once it coughed up 4 turnovers and 7 points in a 1:30 span. All props got to Jonas Aidoo and Johnell Davis for pulling off the upset. Arkansas beats Kansas in the tournament for the 2^(nd) time in 3 years. This also breaks a 20-year streak for Kansas. This is the first loss in the First Round for the Jayhawks since 2006. Our first blue blood is gone.

Yale

And another blue blood is gone in different terms. Yale last year shocked the world with an upset over Auburn. With Yale getting most of their guys back with a certain John Poulakidas, Yale was prepped to go after another SEC foe. Yale hung through until late in the game, but Texas A&M was too much for them. Let‚Äôs hope Yale doesn‚Äôt get its federal funding pulled, because, to be honest, the reason that the government had for UPenn to pull its funding is trivial. Ill leave it at that. Back to your studying, nerds.

Missouri

I think its easy to hate all the Drake‚Äôs in the world. Last year‚Äôs tournament, Drake denied Cream Abdul-Jabbar‚Äôs moment to shine. Also last year, another Drake just happened to get exposed in front of the whole damn music industry. But as time goes on, we all forget what made us angry at them and just accept their omnipresence. Drake just defeated a mid-SEC team in the first round. Once again, shocker.

Utah State

Utah State is on the right foot with Jerrod Calhoun putting up a 26-win season in his first year. Unfortunately, they had to face the Pacific ‚Äúbrick wall of the hardwood‚Äù known as UCLA. Funny. The Big Ten mediocre teams are doing well so far.

Nebraska-Omaha

Hypocritical that I picked Omaha as a longshot upset bid. But St Johns I believe is the weakest 2^(nd) seed. St Johns does do a lot of playing down to competition, but they make up for it with shutdown defensive tactics in the 2^(nd) half and three-point shooting. Omaha might have had AEW wrestlers and Jon Gruden on their side and an early lead to boot, but Pitino has been there done that. It took a long while to get going, but St Johns would win their first March Madness game in 25 years. Omaha, you‚Äôre no longer elbow-dropping trash cans; you are the trash cans. Respectfully, of course.

UC San Diego

I just keep missing on the March Madness Whack-a-Mole, do I? UC San Diego was a favorable ‚Äúupset‚Äù pick over Michigan. UC San Diego went 30-4 and Big West champs. The only problem was strength of schedule, but with a commanding resume its hard to ignore them. Michigan would take control the whole game but trouble was brewing. The Tritons would take full advantage of Michigan‚Äôs turnover struggles and even managed to take the lead late. But the Triton quest of a maiden win comes to an end due to Michigan‚Äôs high-end talent saving their asses in the closing minutes. Valient game by the Tritons. They could be back, but I doubt they‚Äôd have a 30-win season again. Don‚Äôt scare us like that again, Michigan.

UNC Wilmington

Texas Tech would also have a scare in the closing moments of Day 1. UNCW was right with Texas Tech the whole game due to output from the bench, mostly from Nolan Hodge. The Seahawk‚Äôs attack was relentless, but it wasn‚Äôt enough to keep up with Texas Tech. Elijah Hawkins would check out the game with a double-double, instrumental in his own right. Sigh of relief for Texas Tech.

Mississippi State

Yet another mid SEC team with no reason to be here has gone to past. I‚Äôll give it this, they managed to hang in till the very end. But Baylor has tournament experience and a certain Jeremy Roach who transferred from Duke. Still a very entertaining game.

Robert Morris

Oh great. Another year where Alabama stupefyingly plays down to a small school for most of the game. Robert Morris almost had it. They were leading at one point in the game. But the hot streak just ended for them. Mark Sears and Grant Nelson were just too much premium talent for the Colonials. Not much on clutch shots, but more on awareness and taking fouls. And there were a lot of questionable fouls down the stretch. Brush that shit up, Bama, cause you‚Äôre not getting to the championship with performances like this. Interesting that Nate Oats would withhold Grant Nelson until the end of the game.

Lipscomb

A university that combs lips? Never heard of it. But like what happens after combing, it is immediately ruined when there‚Äôs a strong wind. Never had a chance.

Memphis

Looks like the leading mid-major school is out early. Colorado State had tons of momentum riding on one of the longest active winning streaks. The Rams had control all 2^(nd) half. The wait will have to continue for PJ Haggerty to bloom in the tournament. Damn shame if Penny Hardaway would waste this man. The discontinuation of the Penny is gonna happen if it comes to this. At least you all have the Grizzlies.

Mount Saint Mary‚Äôs

Opponents cower. Cooper is back. Raise the black Flagg.

Vanderbilt

The other Saint Mary‚Äôs faired way better. Oh look what we have here. Yet ANOTHER mid SEC team biting the dust in the first round. Vanderbilt was one of the more likable ones to me. They had been giant killers in SEC play, yet they can‚Äôt put away the Gaels. They may have been built near a Wendy‚Äôs, but they ain‚Äôt fresh.

UNC

At least one of those SEC teams (that doesn‚Äôt have any tournament experience) did something. In fact, they did most of America a huge favor of putting out UNC. The Tar Heels now exit the tournament with a Quad 1 record of 1-13. Justice prevails today. This leaves only one ACC team remaining, the least ever for the ACC for the Second Round.

Grand Canyon

GCU came into this tournament with a tough act to follow. They must return to the uncharted territory of the second round. Instead what they got was an absolute pummeling by Maryland. Deep hole, isn‚Äôt it Lopes?

Norfolk State

The second of the HBCU‚Äôs in this tournament are extinguished. And just like Alabama State, it was to a superior SEC school. More on the entertaining side of blowout, though.

Troy

Troy was another big upset bid and why shouldn‚Äôt they? Kentucky had been the most recent running gag of the NCAA tournament. On how they‚Äôre not built for March and all that? Well, this is a new Kentucky. And thank fucking God the Wildcats actually did what they were supposed to do. And a healthy blowout. Positive signs for them, indeed.

Marquette

You weren‚Äôt fond to just losing to St John‚Äôs three times this season, but you end your season losing to New Mexico. Those Lobos have Rick Pitino‚Äôs son, Richard, as their head coach. In Godfather terms, you just lost to Michael Corleone‚Äôs team. You cannot make this shit up, can you?

Akron

I said it once before and I‚Äôll say it again: no MACtion?

Oklahoma

This wasn‚Äôt unlike a UConn tournament game as of late. Normally, they kick the shit out of opponents and leave the carcasses for the rats. But with that drop off in talent, it would be a lot harder to put away opponents, even with Oklahoma being a mid-ass team. In fact at the half, the Sooners were in a good position. They were trailing closely but weren‚Äôt shooting well. They were due. And UConn was racking up the fouls quickly. But somehow, UConn just didn‚Äôt falter. Goes to show that even with them down, they still have the grit to carry on. Oklahoma will have to carry their Schooner back home.

Xavier

\*Cincinnati Bungle music plays\*

Congrats Xavier on getting rid of that burnt orange cancer known as Texas. Your reward is getting another burnt orange opponent; and this time, it‚Äôs a real contender. Illinois just doused the Musketeers with their 3-point shooting. How could anyone stop Will Riley while hot? Not them. Don‚Äôt feel bad, Cincy fans. Opening day is next week. They always got this huge festival outside Great American. Nowadays that‚Äôs the only thing Cincinnati people look forward to until football season because the Reds will ultimately disappoint yet again. In other words, Cincy, enjoy the long offseason.

\*update\* Looks like Texas gets the last laugh. Like pirates on a treasure hunt, they have stolen the X from Xavier. In other words, they hired their head coach Sean Miller.

Bryant

Goddamn, I didn‚Äôt know March Madness was a nickname for a UFC event. Eric Timberlake for Bryant got busted open badly after taking an elbow hit. He was fine, but safety above everything else. Bryant hung in there for a half, then it just crashed down. You just got Izzo‚Äôd. \*SWAMP IZZO tag\* I DIDN‚ÄôT CALL YOU SWAMP! GET THE FUCK OUTTA HERE! Ahem, as I was saying, Izzo passes Bill Self all-time in March Madness wins (for now).

Liberty

The Conservatives are gonna get so pissed when they found out their school just lost to the state school where hard drugs are legal. Told you they‚Äôre tournament-ready.

**Second Round**

McNeese

The Purdue Invitational kicks off the Second Round this time. Purdue is primed for another showdown with a double-digit seed. McNeese had it all. The aura, the resume, the fact they beat Clemson. Purdue, is gonna fuck up like they always do. Just look at them getting up by 25 points at half and‚Ä¶ ok seriously, what the fuck is going on? Purdue‚Äôs supposed to choke in these big games, not catch fire beyond the arch! This Purdue Invitational is going bad for me as me investing in crypto. Only two pure Cinderella teams remain. Now can someone tell me what‚Äôs McNeese‚Äôs obsession with Amir Khan?

St Johns

I knew that once Arkansas won Thursday night, St Johns would be in a world of trouble. John Calipari has known Rick Pitino from the very beginning. He knows the ins and outs, his tactics, his strategies, etc. The 2^(nd) seed moniker St Johns had didn‚Äôt fool me one bit. They haven‚Äôt been a dominating team and they‚Äôve always shown up in the 2^(nd) half. What Arkansas did was what St Johns couldn‚Äôt: a better defense. RJ Luis couldn‚Äôt make a damn thing and Kadary Thompson got fouled out in the closing moments. St Johns was held to less than 30% shooting, which is a grave stat for this tournament. In what may be the last meeting between these two coaches, Calipari has now officially etched his legacy in his first year at Arkansas. St Johns is eliminated. This is why you don‚Äôt bring Spike Lee into playoff games, even in college. He is cursed.

Texas A&M

Well, the SEC hasn‚Äôt been on the same page, but, hey, at least the top-heavy teams are carrying the conference again. Texas A&M, for example, are currently brushing those Michigan suck-ups. A comfortable 10 point lead. What more could you ask for? Its not like Michigan is gonna come back and‚Ä¶ \*collapse\* oh course they fucking did! Star Command to Buzz, you‚Äôre a fucking numbskull of a head coach. 6^(th) Man, relay that message for the sake of everyone. First-weekend exits won‚Äôt cut it for him anymore. Michigan fans will never regret Roddy Gayle Jr ever again after this game.

Drake

As it is in real life, Drake gets mopped by a stronger opponent. Wished it was a California school for the memes, but that‚Äôs a minorrrrrrr nitpick.

Creighton

There is a lot of credit that I haven‚Äôt given out to Creighton. They did a phenomenal job of putting Auburn in check. Jackson McAndrew and Ryan Kalkbrenner are two exciting whites that got their end of the bargain. Unfortunately, Creighton would eventually get a disease common nowadays in Nebraska: bird flu. Auburn just had a little more gas at the end. UConn is now the last team left in the Big East.

Wisconsin

Sobers vs Alcoholics. You‚Äôd imagine that the Big Ten invincibility would wear off at some point. Well, that point is now. That scoreboard operator tilting the score bug was the omen. BYU had control all game. BYU had bench points while Wisconsin is stretched thin on them. And once Wisconsin finally got back to within one possession in a bid to steal the game, long fingers would have their own mind. Yet another despairing end to the season for the cheeseheads. With that, the Mormons gets a tournament reward that they haven‚Äôt gotten in 15 years: a Sunday‚Äôs rest.

Gonzaga

A heavyweight fight against two of the winningest active coaches. The loser of this game would end their Sweet 16 streak (2019 for Houston, 2015 for Gonzaga). One has to give. Houston came out swinging with LJ Cryer shooting threes all over. Gonzaga would have to catch up. In the nick of time, they did catch up with Houston while they were caught in a scoring drought. It gets too close for comfort with 30 seconds left. With a lead by one, Cryer would shoot two critical free throws. Gonzaga has no other options but to shoot the three, in which Houston immediately swarms in triple coverage and pressures the ball out. Checkmate. Gonzaga‚Äôs Sweet 16 streak is over. Mark Few‚Äôs legacy of failure continues.

UCLA

I honestly got nothing to say about this one. This was about the most dull game with the dullest of outcomes. Tennessee‚Äôs rebounding game just outmatched the turnover struggles. Not to mention Tennessee shooting 50% on 3‚Äôs, yikes. Funny that Tennessee escapes Rupp Arena while Louisville was lost long ago.

UConn

With the Chiefs failing in the Super Bowl, only UConn remains to clinch a three-peat, one that hasn‚Äôt been done since the John Wooden days of UCLA. But UConn‚Äôs next opponent was the last team that won consecutive March Madness tournaments before UConn: Florida. Florida‚Äôs inexperience showed most of the game. UConn is more veteran-seasoned while Florida is still blooming. Everyone was contributing for UConn. McNeeley, Karaban, ‚ÄúRamadan‚Äù Diarra. It was clicking and they had a lead! But UConn would slow down the game in the closing moments and bank on Florida to miss shots. But for the Gators, they don‚Äôt miss. Clayton would serve up the onions and end UConn‚Äôs bid to win a third straight. This also knocks out the Big East this year. Dan Hurley in the back of his mind should‚Äôve left to the Lakers when he had the chance.

Baylor

There was a time not too long ago when Jeremy Roach was a star player for Duke. Now, he‚Äôs facing his former school as basically a one-man army; and Duke has a full infantry. Yet another mauling at the hands of Duke. Someone hug Tyrese Proctor, cause he‚Äôs going through it.

Illinois

This is the game of Mark Pope‚Äôs career. Im not kidding. Its one thing of getting a March Madness win. You have to get one against a tough Power 5 opponent; the opponent in question is Illinois. Kentucky is finally doing what they should‚Äôve been doing and using the full potential of their stars. Koby Brea had by far his best game with 23 points. All while Illinois‚Äô star player, Will Riley somehow cant do jackshit after exploding in output and clutchness last game. And add to the mix turnovers, and what you got was a vintage Kentucky win in March. Illinois still can‚Äôt beat those damn Wildcats. Perhaps with this much of an owning, KFC should‚Äôve moved their headquarters to Illinois, not Texas.

Saint Mary‚Äôs

The Gaels look for their first Sweet 16 bid in 15 years. Unfortunately, they have to face Bama. And unfortunately and Bama are two words that don‚Äôt combine well in basketball. Saint Mary‚Äôs got plagued in three-point shooting, which was the main thing holding them back. Bama didn‚Äôt pull away until late, but with Mark Sears and Cliff Omoruyi, they just took their sweet time. Bama‚Äôs going back to the Sweet 16.

Colorado State

Welp, with all but one AQ bid beyond the 11 seed gone, we automatically crown Colorado State the Cinderella of the tournament. The pressure is on for Maryland to end the campaign. The Rams just controlled this whole game as if Maryland was a fucking bystander. Most notably the rebound sector. Maryland, however, would recover from a double digit deficit and took the lead late. But the Rams took it right back. A notable stat: Colorado State only lost one game when leading with 5 minutes to go. With Colorado State getting a massive three to take the lead with less than 30 seconds left, Maryland will get the ball. Its all or nothing.

‚ÄúGillespie from the outabounds. To the freshman, Queen, who‚Äôs driving. Floats it! OHHHH! MARYLAND! AT THE RIGHT SIDE OF A BUZZER BEATER!‚Äù

\*HERE I COME TO SAVE THE DAYYYYY!\*

God save the queen. Soft serve ice cream for everyone in College Park! Finally, an actual thrilling finish in this tournament. I feel so sorry for Colorado State. All of this building up of culture and all they get is being at the wrong side of the buzzer. Replay shows Derik Queen might‚Äôve gotten away with a travel. That‚Äôs a major screwjob.

Iowa State

I knew that Keshon Gilbert‚Äôs absence would come soon and bite Iowa State in the ass. And it bit them hard. Ole Miss basically came in this tournament with nothing to lose. Sweet 16 is an unheard-of threshold for the Rebels and they made sure that they would secure that spot. Iowa State‚Äôs starters just went flat-out cold. Curtis Jones scored 26 from the bench, but that was not cutting it with Ole Miss shooting 58%. Iowa State went from #2 in the country to laughing stock of Day 4. Goddamnit ‚ÄòClones.

New Mexico

The Lobos are now the last double-digit seed remaining. Just like Colorado State before them, they made a valiant effort to control the game. But Michigan State comes through with valuable bench points and Jaden Akins. We bid farewell to the other Pitino.

Oregon

Our last matchup in the 2^(nd) round is a matchup rooted in the glory days of the Pac 12: Oregon vs Arizona. Bill Walton would be proud. In the first half of that game, Oregon would take a sweltering 15-point lead, but was quickly consummated. Arizona took the lead thereafter, but Oregon would hang by a thread. Caleb Love scored 29 points and 9 rebounds in this game. Oregon had a chance to tie down by three, but they somehow took the two. This relegates this game to being a free-throw shoot-off. After multiple rounds, Shelstad was the first to blink and Arizona would come away with the win. Hey, maybe Arizona could get past the Sweet 16 this time. \*Duke vs Arizona next matchup\* Nevermind, you‚Äôre fucked.

**Sweet 16**

BYU

Newark, New Jersey. A city notorious for unspeakable violence in any kind. Tonight, we have witnessed this sort of slaughter. The killers in question: Mark Sears, Chris Youngblood, and Aden Holloway. The weapon of choice: the three-ball. What made these atrocities shocking? Mark Sears had 10 three-pointers ALONE. Alabama would have with a scoring rampage and would end up scoring triple digits. BYU didn‚Äôt even have a chance to catch up. And so a funeral will be planned for the Mormons. Unfortunately, we don‚Äôt have any Latter-Day churches that are as grandiose as they do in Utah. You know what? They should rent out the Cathedral Basilica for this. Why the fuck not?

Maryland

Derik Queen is royalty, we all know that. And for his Rams bounty, he was ordered some alligators to fill his moat around his castle (let‚Äôs just call him king, cause these pronouns are gonna be confusing). Although a gator moat is fictitious in medieval times, it applies here. Derik Queen just so happens that there isn‚Äôt a bridge connecting the castle to the outlands. So to get past the moat, he has to fight the Gators. To no avail, Derik Queen is dethroned. Oh well.

\*Update\* Looks like Kevin Willard is taking the crown for himself. He's off to Nova. Derik Queen, you're move.

Arizona

Of course it had to come to this. Caleb Love just could not escape Duke, can he? I mean to his credit, he put up 35 points in this game, ripe for Sportscenter highlights when going up against any other team. But no. The spotlight gets taken once Cooper Flagg steps up. Flagg would get 30 points. He also records 6 rebounds, 7 assists, 3 blocks, and a steal. With those numbers and the fact he‚Äôs a freshman, its justified. But Arizona lacks the thing that sets it apart from Duke: a supporting cast. Awaka, Townsend, and Dell‚ÄôOrso only made parcels and they got pulled pretty early for Veesaar, Bryant, and KJ Lewis. Those guys faired a little better. But compared to Duke, it gets you nowhere. If you combined all the points from these Arizona players above, it would not even come close to the combined points from Sion James, Malauch, and Knueppel. That‚Äôs all I need to see. Tommy Lloyd will continue his tradition: yet ANOTHER Sweet 16 exit.

Arkansas

Could getting Calipari as head coach really lose you 16 points or more on game insurance? Did the little piggy cry wee wee wee all the way home?

\*Geico Commercial plays\*

Calipari. 15 minutes left can lose you 16 points or more on game insurance.

Seriously, Calipari is a fucking disgrace. Its like he never left Lexington.

Ole Miss

Ole Miss should be proud that they made it this far. Chris Beard has proven that his tournament experience with Texas Tech is transferable. And to his credit, Beard had to make his next opponent work for it. Tom Izzo is notorious for beating SEC opponents in the tournament. But somehow, the Spartans trailed all game. They had to come back not once, but twice from double digits. This crosses a fine line believing that this is a zombie infestation rather than a legitimate choke. Michigan State just had too much high-end talent. Another SEC team bites the dust.

Kentucky

This is why you should never gloat too early. Kentucky may have shed Calipari‚Äôs choking habits, but now its time for them to return to the traditional way: ass whipped by a stronger opponent. Actually, I don‚Äôt think that best describes this matchup. Kentucky won both meetings in SEC against the Vols. But like with everything else, it‚Äôs a clean slate. For Kentucky, Otega Oweh and Lamont Butler didn‚Äôt impact the game as much as previous games. But all of Tennessee‚Äôs starters were impact players in their own right. Zeigler and Lainer put up similar numbers, but there also was Jordan Gainey from putting up 20 from the bench and Okpara getting 11 rebounds. It just goes to show that Kentucky may have gotten back their winning culture, but they still have a long way to go.

Michigan

We all have some humanity in us. Before the game, Bruce Pearl invited family members of an American hostage held captive in Gaza. The ironic, or perhaps unifying, thing about it is that Edan Alexander, the hostage, his favorite player is Danny Wolf, a Michigan player. So Bruce Pearl went out of his way to get him a photo of him for his family. Ain‚Äôt that charitable of him? Danny Wolf put up an inspiring effort with 20 points and shooting 50%. In fact, much of the first half was inspiring defensive-wise for both teams. Something is really wrong with Auburn. First last game, now this game they play below their talent level. But nonetheless, Auburn would pull away in the 2^(nd) with them dominating the rebounding game, Denver Jones shooting threes, and Tahaad Pettiford getting in those bench points. If Auburn plays like this, they won‚Äôt survive much longer.

Purdue

Contrary to popular belief, this is not a Purdue Invitational matchup despite this game being held in Indy. Why? Purdue‚Äôs the higher/lower seed and they‚Äôre taking on #1 Houston. Close game first half, but Houston pulled away in the 2^(nd). This is why having Zach Edey is a disadvantage for the Boilermakers. And I‚Äôve harped on this time and time again, but it is worth mentioning that he was the missing piece. Houston would extend it to a 10 point lead, but Purdue gets a much-needed comeback late. A clutch 3 ties it up with 30 seconds to go. Now Purdue just needs a stop.

‚ÄúThe tip! NO! And it goes out of bounds! To Houston!‚Äù

Like I said, Edey should‚Äôve made a rebound, not a swat out of bounds. You talk about difference, THAT‚ÄôS THE DIFFERENCE. And with that, Houston has a chance to actually win the game on this possession.

‚ÄúUzan gets it in. Gets it back! AND HE PUTS IT IN!‚Äù

In the immortal words of Chester Bennington, ‚ÄúI tried so hard and got so far. But in the end, it doesn‚Äôt even matter‚Äù. That‚Äôs what this game is. A microcosm of the season for Purdue if you ask me. Purdue may have been talented, but they don‚Äôt have the it-factor.

**Elite 8**

Texas Tech

Let‚Äôs cut straight to the chase, Texas Tech is Lolcow of this whole tournament. And that is saying something because McCasland doesn‚Äôt have pedigree in both choking and winning in the tournament. Texas Tech had Florida staring down the barrel. A 10 point lead with 5 to go. But Texas Tech had overlooked one major thing about the Gators: never let Clayton Jr get hot. Clayton would have 30 points this game. Thomas Haugh also did his part in this comeback. Raining threes all around as Florida ends the game on an 18-4 run. What really sold the game for Texas Tech was Darrion Williams missing a three‚Ä¶ while down by 1 with 33 seconds left. Im just gonna let this decision linger for a little bit. How STUPID can you be, Williams? TAKE THE FUCKING LAYUP NEXT TIME, WILL YA? IT SHOULDN‚ÄôT BE THAT HARD OF A CHOICE TO MAKE! Florida shoots the free throws and survives because of Tech‚Äôs own incompetence. Prevent this in the future, Grant. You are becoming an easy target for me.

Alabama

There is not one, but two devils in New Jersey currently. And these two banes of our existence shall fight to the death. And Alabama Football hosts BOTH fanbases. Im sure this is going to be an entertaining game. \*implosion\* Im gonna need to throw up.

\*colored bars\*

That was my champion I picked, by the way. And the champion I picked died like a dog at the sight of Duke. The best offense in the league just gone‚Ä¶ flat. They live by the three, and they sure as hell died by the three. They keep throwin em and they keep missin em. 32 attempts with only a quarter of them hitting, atrocious by their standards. Where was Omoruyi? Where was Mark Sears? They were two of the most reliable players on the squad and yet they only combined for 10 points? And Duke was booming all game long. Knueppel and Flagg, the exciting whites, had healthy showings, with Knueppel having a career game. This is the game that Duke proved me wrong. And wrong I was thinking that Alabama would be immortal.

Tennessee

I should say the exact same thing for Tennessee. Although, their performance was MUCH worse offensively. Only 15 fucking points in the first half? Are you shitting me Vols? I mean, I know that Houston would give them a hard time, but oh my God, they didn‚Äôt even try to fucking score. I don‚Äôt think that Tennessee deserves anymore attention. Good ole Rocky Flop rides again. Oh, I almost forgot to say this. \*clearing throat\* CONGRATULATIONS TENNESSEE! YOU **STILL** CANT MAKE IT TO THE FINAL FOUR!

Michigan State

Before this game, Tom Izzo was 10-0 against SEC opponents in the tournament. I had full confidence Michigan State would get one more win over them. Auburn had other plans. Auburn would score 15 unanswered early and they never conceded that margin. Johni Broome just did it all. 25 points, 14 rebounds, automatic on range. He‚Äôs the real reason Auburn‚Äôs unstoppable at this point. And despite Michigan State keeping other players in check, they just can‚Äôt with him. But if Michigan State would go out, they would leave one lasting mark on this game. \*injury\* Johni Broome got injured. His X-rays were negative, but Auburn must proceed with caution. Auburn passed a huge test.

\*colored bars\*

Kind of a pointless tournament, huh? This is only the second time in the tournament‚Äôs history where all #1 seeds are in the Final Four. 2008 was the only other time this happened. The SEC is represented with Auburn and Florida. These two teams play each other, so the SEC will have a guaranteed spot in the championship game. Houston and Duke, two respective champions of their conferences, play in the other game. Houston and Auburn are looking for their first championships, while Florida tries to get its first since their back-to-back titles in the 2000s. And if Duke wins it all? The season is fucked. So who am I picking?

Florida has more firepower than Auburn, so Im picking them to win the first game. And Duke will probably destroy Houston. Im picking Duke to win it all.",5,1743471319.0,UrinatingTree,1,1.0,False

1jojxz6,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDeprogram/comments/1jojxz6/a_lukewarm_defence_of_hasan_piker/,A lukewarm defence of Hasan Piker,"I've been seeing a lot of criticism of Mr Piker for his lack of scrutiny in his interview with Bernie & AOC on this and other Marxist subs recently.

I'm making this post because it's obviously on some people's minds, and I don't think it should be a surprise to anybody. I also don't really think it matters, and if you're that bent out of shape about it you may, respectfully, need to touch grass. I'm not defending him as a fan, just a casual consumer of his content. I think there are plenty of reasons to criticise the guy from a ""vanilla"" leftist stand point, let alone a Marxist-Leninist one. That said, accounting for his status *as a worker,* I don't begrudge him for not painting a massive target on himself.

To state my premise clearly: Hasan had the opportunity to ask some hard questions, particularly in relation to the ongoing genocide in Gaza; an injustice that no principled ""leftist"" can abide. He didn't ask those questions. If the interview was conducted by an experienced & principled journalist supported by an outlet that would back him if he went in swinging, I might consider this a professional failure.

But that's not the scenario: Hasan Piker is just a dude on the internet. Personally, I think he's a pretty good dude who wields his platform responsibly. I would happily buy him a beer (I don't know if he drinks, so perhaps a coffee or a Mountain Dew or whatever.) Given the format of his content, the analysis is thin, but he does generally present the cliff notes of the Marxist critique of capitalism with some consistency. I don't know if he formally considers himself a Marxist of any sort, but his brand and persona are, at the very least, counter-capitalist and counter-liberal.

***This is a good thing, every little helps;*** the sad truth is that most Western consumers are trained to defend capitalism, not criticise it. If the man has helped even a small fraction of his audience develop a bit of class consciousness, he has contributed to the cause. Sure, he's not vanguard party leadership material, but he does more good than harm.

I'm inclined to think that if the U.S. revolution came tomorrow Hasan would contribute. As far as ""online leftism"" goes, that's good enough for me, I'll reserve my deeper analysis for people who I might have to stand shoulder to shoulder with in my own countries' revolution. Beyond that, he can manoeuvre his media presence however he sees fit. Good for him.

Hasan has found himself in a unique position; he is a semi-mainstream independent content creator who is actually able to propagandize in the opposite direction while maintaining a significant audience. This is a super precarious position for a public figure to be in, and I do not condemn his caution managing it. I might even suggest he deserves his fame, it certainly suits him and he works hard to maintain his brand. He seems generally principled, and is capable of self critique, but that brand is his priority. Going for a deep cut or gotcha against the closest thing the US has to a left wing would compromise that, and for what? Alienating direct, high profile contacts in the political mainstream.

The man uses his limited influence to the best of his ability. Would I do things differently in his shoes? Well, yes I would, but I wouldn't compromise my carefully cultivated position for the sake of shaming a couple of liberal politicians. The man is doing the best he can with what he has, and he's operating in a highly reactionary, proto-fascist media environment. You want to make a spectacle of pinning two ultimately meaningless figures down on a genocide, then secure the interview yourself.

TL;DR The interview was poor, banal even, but so fucking what? Most set piece interviews are. By all means, criticize Hasan for bad takes, but holding politicians to direct account is not his role, and may well have compromised his ability to make the limited difference he does.",8,1743471049.0,TheDeprogram,26,0.6,False

I've been diagnosed for about a year and have struggled to find the right meds. Vyvanse (30mg) has been the best for me as it puts me in a great, almost euphoric mood especially at my work which helps. However, recently I've had horrible crashes around 5pm and have felt miserable, depressed, angry etc, so I took a break from it and just got by on a coffee a day. 

Recently I've tried taking it again and I've felt entirely scattered with anxiety symptoms such as increased heart rate, feeling overwhelmed etc. So I only ever take if for a day, feel scattered, then go back off it for a week or so. 

Does anyone know if maybe I just need to adjust to the medication again, and if so how long does it take? Because it's giving me the opposite effect and at this stage tackling life unmedicated feels easier than trying with the meds. I'm in my final semester of Uni by the way so focusing is of utmost importance. 

TL;DR: Been on Vyvanse for a year, initially worked well but now causes horrible crashes and anxiety. Took a break, but when retrying, it makes me feel scattered and overwhelmed. Wondering if I just need to readjust and how long that might take. Final semester of uni, so focus is crucial‚Äîany advice?

I‚Äôm considering a couple nights at Strawberry Hill but I‚Äôm not sold just yet - I would like something away and quiet.

I want to go to the beach and of course get some fry fish. Always enjoyed likkle ochi but not sure if it‚Äôs a beach day location that I can setup at all day. It‚Äôs either beach or something like a YS falls. I had a brilliant fish in Kingston at a restaurant I can‚Äôt remember the name of (eta: sea krave in manor park) but no beach.

I quit sugar because I was noticing signs of metabolic disregulation even though my bloods are good on fasting glucose and other diabetic markers.  I had this problem where I would wake up in the night ravenously hungry and if I didn't eat I wouldn't fall back asleep.  It was so annoying!

I also noticed I had put on weight in the last year more rapidly than I would have expected.  Suspecting the night eating, I knew the issue was because my blood sugar was tanking overnight.  Having done keto before I knew what to do.

I also have fibromyalgia, so I was hopeful this lifestyle change may have a positive effect on my pain since inflammation is related to fibro pain.  I have already quit gluten for precisely this reason: gluten aggravates my fibro pain like nothing else can and dropping it out brought my symptoms down by like 80%. Maybe dropping sugar can get me up to 90%?

What I've noticed:  

I sleep like a log now.  I'm a lifelong insomniac so the fact that I sleep so well is amazing, and from such a simple change! It makes me wonder what my life could have been like if I wasn't eating sugar since childhood.  However, I don't sleep less.  I sleep soundly and easily but still sleep as much as I ever did.

I de-bloated and lost circumference around my waist.  I don't weigh or measure my body because it's ED triggering for me, but I do notice my clothes looking and fitting better.  My face looks more shapely and pretty.  

I can go a long time without eating now, which solved my night time hunger problem.

Before I would not have an appetite in the morning but still have this gnawing hunger in my stomach and would feel tired and moody if I didn't eat.  Not anymore!

My taste changed so now I crave watery veggies like cucumbers and peppers instead of treats.  I have not added sweeteners to my diet except stevia in my coffee.  I haven't dabbled with allulose baking or anything yet.  I wanna get really comfortable with veggie based snacks and meals first.

I didn't experience any cravings except for one day about 2 weeks ago.  I had an aspartame diet soda at the in-laws and not only got a fibro flare from it but was snacky afterwards, so I ate some potato chips and that started a craving cycle.  Thankfully it went away within a day.

My fibro pain is unchanged, so far.  I do have other chronic pain issues like in my shoulder and I noticed that got noticeably better, so I'm hopeful to see how getting more months under my belt on no-sugar will change my pain overall.

Timelines:

When I started I wanted to know how long the hard part would last so here's my experience.

The first week was hard, I felt the withdrawal symptoms of grouchiness and fatigue the most, plus muscle and joint pains.  This lasted about 5 days.

Week 2 I was lethargic but could tell I was past the worst of it.  It may have been a coincidence but I pulled my knee badly and have been recovering since. Not sure if my joints are looser or something because of the change...

 By week 3 I was noticing a lot more mental energy and I was able to keep my mind occupied all day including at work without feeling exhausted.  I had interests again.  I felt low-key happy most of the time.  I wanted to read and watch new things, my mind became curious again.

Week 4 was when I really noticed the dip in my appetite and hunger.  My leptin must be more stable now.  I have the stamina to batch cook and meal prep where before I was always ordering delivery because cooking was such a chore.

Takeaways:

This change wasn't too hard for me because my diet was already low in carby desserts from my no-gluten diet, and the emotional impact of dropping sugar wasn't very strong since I gave up the gluten over a year ago already.  I had mourned the gluten, so there didn't feel like much point in mourning sugar.  It just felt like the logical next step.  Being chronically ill will do that to a person.  You become willing to sacrifice stuff just to have a little quality of life back.  

I can tell that my health improvements will be gradual and slow.  It wasn't a night and day change for me in just this first month, but definitely a change for the positive!  I will continue this lifestyle change forever if I can help it!

For details on my diet, I don't eat refined carbs or sugars/sweeteners except stevia.  I eat fruit maybe every other day at this point.  I've lost taste for grains and primarily have sweet potato as a carb.  Otherwise my diet is full of veggies, dairy proteins like cheese and yogurt, eggs and beans, and some meat though I prefer it the least (just personal preference).  I also eat avocados, olive oil, butter, and nuts.

I'm currently unable to exercise but my hope is that as I continue this I will be able to do more movement with less pain! I'm hopeful for the future which I truly can't remember having for years.  This is the best result of eating this way I could possibly have hoped for! ",6,1743470414.0,sugarfree,0,0.88,False

I was just chilling, enjoying some fresh air with my coffee, wearing a regular t-shirt, gym shorts, and slippers, and scrolling on my phone when a foreign-looking, skinny-built guy wearing eyeglasses and a medical mask sat beside me and started small talk. He asked for my name and age, and I responded politely and asked for his as well. He told me his name, but I wasn‚Äôt really paying attention. He said he was 22 years old. 

Then the conversation quickly got weird. He started telling stories about how, whenever he goes to different places, girls supposedly jump on him and try to kiss him. Mind you, I wasn‚Äôt responding anymore thinking he could read the room and leave. But he kept on going and made inappropriate comments about my outfit, saying my shorts looked sexy while they looked ugly on other girls.ü§Æ

What‚Äôs worse is he even tried to take a photo of me!! That‚Äôs when I left.

I get the feeling he was just casually looking around for women he could target. Please note, I‚Äôm not stereotyping anyone based on nationality or appearance. I‚Äôm just sharing my experience and want to emphasize that I always try to be friendly to everyone. 

As a soft-spoken person, I didn‚Äôt know how to react in that moment, and I felt violated. Now, I‚Äôm starting to have trust issues. Ladied, please stay aware of your surroundings and trust your instincts. If someone makes you uncomfortable, don‚Äôt hesitate to walk away.

1jojmnj,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/1jojmnj/whats_the_most_potent_medicine_for_ruminations/,"What's the most potent medicine for ruminations? Not anxiety, not depression, not compulsions...I think I can beat OCD if I control the ruminations but I can't do it without help.","When I analyze my OCD, I realize there are barely any physical compulsions. When obsessions hit me, avoidance and rumination are the kind of compulsion I use. I never count to specific numbers, or wash my hands several times and things like that. I just avoid the things I'm afraid of and, if I think I might have done something that can be bad for me, I start ruminating, come to the conclusion that other people do such thing and nothing bad happens to them, but I don't find any relief by recognizing my fears are irrational. I know they are irrational yet the fear of the worst case scenario happening are so intense that no matter how absurd my obsessions are...the loop of ruminating never ends.

1. Once the intrusive thought hits me, I try to apply logic (I know I shouldn't do that), like thinking if other people touch or eat or do what I'm afraid of and imagine if something bad happens to them.

2. Realize people do such things and nothing bad happens to them. Even me before OCD did such things and nothing happened.

3. Try to find ""if's"" or exceptions...and hang onto that tiny % of the bad thing happening. Maybe it doesn't happen to 99.99999% of people but it can still happen to me, because no one can guarantee it won't happen.

\*In the end, I avoid exposure because the fear of this tiny % of probability. Also, my mind tricks me and makes me think that even if such bad thing is not gonna happen to me; the fear itself can create a placebo effect  and make it happen by pure somatisation. For example, some women are so terrified of getting pregnant that they even develop the symptoms of pregnancy...but pregnancy can't happen just by somatisation so they can beat the OCD when they realize they aren't pregnant despite all the symptoms. BUT, what if your worst fear is a symptom?? 

For example, imagine your worst fear is acne, or a skin rash, or diarrhea when you are with people...Then if you are obsessed with the idea that a specific food can cause acne, or diarrhea, or something like that, you'll avoid that because you know that by pure obsession you can think yourself into the diarrhea or anxiety or whatever. How do you deal with OCD in that case? 

Also, doctors and other experts in OCD often say that obsessions are involuntary but ruminations are voluntary so we can control them...Well, ruminations are almos automatic and I don't know if they are voluntary or not but they are EXTREMELY difficult to control.  That's why I can't engage in therapy. 

PD: As for meds, I've been on SSRI's (Paroxetine, Fluvoxamine, etc...) and they help but I've never achieved 100% control or remission. Psychiatrist suggested Clomipramine but I'm terrified of its side effects. I've been prescribed Abilify to potentiate the SSRI and control ruminations but I've read such horror stories that I can't start taking it. Some people say it messed their brains up, others talk about akathisia, others about diabetes and other help problems. I'm desperate. Also, fluvoxamine interacts with pretty much everything including caffeine. Caffeine lifts my mood and gives me some motivation and now if I drink even small amounts of coffee or cola I struggle to sleep at night. I'm desperate, IDK what medicine or combo try.
