Just got chewed up by this random butterbar for not taking my hand out of my pocket while saluting him.

- it’s true when they say just to drive safely and give the impression of competence - explaining why I was driving cautiously etc definitely helped explain why I might appear to be hesitating 
- i ate three bananas and a cup of coffee an hour prior, along with a chocolate bar and chocolate pastry thing which I think gave me some good energy. Usually I eat a small breakfast of about 200kcal, but I easily topped 600 that morning because I wanted to make sure I had enough fuel in me. Also, I made sure to eat lots the night before so my brain was functioning properly. 
- I talked about road signs to my examiner, especially temporary ones “I’m going slowly here due to the skid risk warning sign” or “I’m slowing for this wiggly bit of road up ahead” 
- I didn’t pause after pulling over and the minute I was told to proceed if I could I did. I didn’t want time to overthink as I’m a huge overthinker 
- I generally didn’t “think” much. I just drove and focused on the road ahead, not really caring for where I was going per se. If I could see the road ahead I considered it etc, but the possible roads I could go onto next never crossed my mind. 
- I treated my exam as a practice go which helped steady my nerves
- asked my instructor lots of questions. On my way over I was panicking and not reading road signs very well and kept asking him what the speed limit was. He was so calm with me and just told me, I guess figuring that I was in a bit of a panic, that just getting given answers helped 
- I tied my hair up to make my eye movements clearer 

I wouldn’t 
- worry as much as I did. I really didn’t need to panic - I’m a competent driver and I’m generally more of a cautious type - I never take risks when driving which I think is important 
- concern myself with perfecting my drive prior to the lesson. I was fine and I did well!

What makes a rental unforgettable? Hint: It's not your high-end coffee maker or plush bedding—it's you, the host. At Llivo, we've learned that travelers deeply value the human connection over property features, whether they're searching for [rooms for rent in DFW](https://llivo.com/p/rooms-for-rent-in-dfw) or comfortable [rooms for rent in San Francisco](https://llivo.com/p/room-for-rent-in-san-francisco). While stylish décor and modern amenities can enhance a stay, it's the warmth, care, and authenticity of the host that earns those coveted five-star reviews.

So, how do you transform ordinary stays into extraordinary experiences?

# Prioritize Genuine Connections

Guests remember interactions more vividly than any material comfort. A warm welcome, thoughtful conversations, and genuine interest in their experience are what guests truly appreciate.

* *Warm greetings:* Personally welcoming your guests, offering refreshments, and making them feel immediately at home.
* *Engage sincerely:* Ask about their trip, interests, and expectations. Make them feel heard and valued.

# Offer Personalized Recommendations

Being a host means being an ambassador for your locality. Share personalized recommendations rather than generic tourist hotspots.

* *Local gems:* Point out hidden cafes, underrated attractions, or local festivals that guests might not find online.
* *Insider tips:* Offer tips on the best times to visit popular spots to avoid crowds and enhance their experience.

# Small Touches, Big Impact

Thoughtful, personalized gestures resonate deeply with guests.

* *Tailored amenities:* Stock the kitchen with your guest’s favorite snacks, or provide local specialties.
* *Handwritten notes:* Leave personalized messages to make guests feel special and warmly welcomed.

# Flexibility and Responsiveness

Responsive communication and flexible accommodation can drastically elevate guest satisfaction.

* *Availability:* Prompt responses and being available to handle requests promptly and courteously.
* *Flexible check-ins and check-outs:* Adjust schedules when possible to accommodate guests’ travel plans comfortably.

# A Host's Story: Building Bonds, Not Just Business

Sara, a Llivo host in Austin, discovered firsthand that hospitality is about human connection. Initially, she believed guests valued her apartment's downtown location the most. However, a recurring theme emerged in reviews:

*“Sara’s warmth and local insights made our trip unforgettable. She recommended a local live music venue, and even joined us for an evening, making us feel like old friends.”*

Sara now emphasizes human interaction, realizing that her personal touch outweighs any property features.

# Llivo’s Approach: Hospitality With Heart

Llivo encourages hosts to embrace a people-first approach:

* *Airport pickup:* A personal welcome right from arrival.
* *Community connection:* Encourage guests to immerse themselves authentically in local culture.
* *Zero guest fees:* Clear pricing helps build trust and fosters positive relationships from the start.

Discover how Llivo supports hosts in providing truly memorable hospitality [here](https://www.llivo.com/signup).

# Final Words: Your Hospitality is Your Greatest Asset

The secret to achieving consistent five-star reviews isn't in luxurious amenities but in your genuine human connection. Prioritize relationships, personalized attention, and authentic engagement to transform each stay into a cherished memory.

1l8zn04,https://v.redd.it/tec1iyac8c6f1,"Here’s a fireball I made, is it cool as hell or what","I understand that this might be classified under rule 1 of the server, as the mechanism to create the fireball could be possibly classified as both a flamethrower and cannon. However to achieve the effect that I did I did a lot of research, testing, building, rebuilding, etc. and if this doesn’t persuade the mods let’s just say the video is purely of the fireball itself and the mechanism to make it I merely a launch pad for the model rocket.

I had 13 iterations of my design for this, 10 of which I made physical prototypes and only 5 of those were able to be pressurized with air without major leaks. 

Only 3 of the 5 were able to withstand the crazy cold temperatures of the liquid propane butane mixture I made.

The two I discarded were made to shoot powder (dairy free coffee creamer) or a calculated 50:25:20:5 petroleum distillate acetone methanol isopropyl alcohol mix as a fuel. This took way too long to calculate for the longest flame length of 6ft 3.5in as fuel. I wanted to atomize the liquid fuel in the air, I made my own atomizing valve so it didn’t look just like a burning fluid coming out but this wasn’t worth it in the end because I didn’t like how hard it was to reload. 

Of the last three iterations two of which used homemade gas release valves. one was much too slow and my hand got uncomfortably close to the fluid that came off during testing and I wasn’t comfortable trying a flame with it. and the other was just too slow.

Lastly the final design, which I’m using right now, uses a solenoid valve that I adjusted for extra airflow. Behind is an an accumulation chamber that has a flashback arrester which took much to long to machine at home without a lathe. and mesh wall to stop flashback as safety, I purge the thing of air before using it anyway. I found a good nozzle can just be made from drilling mostly to the end of one of those air compressor attachments through the center to widen most of it up until the very end and it lets a nice vortex form.

It’s not a super complicated mechanism on paper but when you try to make it in the real world safely without guidelines it’s a very complicated process. I know this is a chem and science related sub and I’m sorry if this is the wrong place to post my creation but I did a lot of fuel testing and physical design work I have spreadsheets upon spreadsheets on nozzle shape to flame distance correlation. I just put a ton of tedious work into this seemingly barbaric setup for an obsession.

So tonight, a bunch of us parents ended up grabbing dinner after a kid’s birthday party. Nothing fancy, they suggested this bar that does burgers, sandwiches, some tapas-style stuff. Cool. My kid and I showed up around 8:30, just the two of us.

We eat. Chill. All good.
But then… bill time.
Crickets. Literally no one says a word. You could cut the tension with a butter knife.

Finally, one of the moms goes, ""Sooo I guess we just split by family?""

Excuse me?
Lady, you came with your husband AND three kids. Plus your sister, who brought HER three kids. Y’all ordered like you were feeding a soccer team.

Meanwhile, I came with one child. I ordered two burgers, one round of drinks, and a plate of patatas bravas. That’s it.

So I got up, went to the bar, told the guy to charge me for just my stuff. Paid. Done. Walked back just in time to see them ordering coffee, shots, and more drinks like we’re in Ibiza.

Like hell I’m dropping €100 so these scavengers can feast and sip chupitos like it’s on me.

Of course, the two freeloading sisters looked super salty.
Now they’re arguing about who ordered what, because apparently some of the kids shared nuggets, croquettes, calamari, etc. Chaos.

I’m sitting back with a gin and tonic watching it all unfold. Not even mad about the money, it’s the principle. I can’t stand being manipulated like that. And trust me, these people knew exactly what they were doing.

Anyway.
How do you guys handle this kind of situation?
Would love to hear I’m not the only one with freeloaders in the parenting circle.

1l8ziup,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_unhappy_radi0/comments/1l8ziup/the_waffle_house_at_the_edge_of_the_woods/,The Waffle House at the edge of the Woods,"Waffle House, an icon of American midwestern and southern culture. Often, it’s yellow glow is a beacon of hope to those late night dwellers, whether they be members of the working class or alcohol favoring partiers. Druggos are also a staple clientele. Waffle House, for better or worse, opens its doors to everyone from every walk of life. 

I will set the scene: it’s a late Thursday night, or early Friday morning in technicality, and I was heading home from a late night bender where I had the important but ultimately boring job of designated driver. All I wanted to do was go home and crack open a cold one for myself to kick off my weekend. Nature had other plans, however. The weather in the midsouth turned on a dime, and tonight was no exception. A downpour diminished any visibility on the road, and I knew I couldn’t confidently drive through this. The familiar yellow glow shone through the onslaught of rain and hail, however, and given that Waffle House will probably remain open under threat of nuclear war, I knew I could seek refuge there. 

The jingling bells welcomed me more than any employee did, but I could not blame them. The restaurant was a mess, probably from a busy evening earlier. The rodeo was this weekend, after all, and those rodeo boys sure loved their Waffle House. Shit, we all did. It was a Waffle Home in this part of town-- it was all we had after the rest of the town went to bed at sundown. 

A waitress sighs and tells me to sit wherever I’d like and she’d get to me when she could. She looked so tired. I picked the one somewhat clean table in the place, and watched the storm rage on outside. My phone confirmed that I would be here for awhile, and all I could do at this point was hope it didn’t evolve into a tornado. Waffle House would probably remain open even if it did. 

Even this late into the night, Waffle House had a buzz of conversation and kitchen noises. I saw a full staff and other customers, and yet, the only sound in the place was the hail beating on the roof and windows. The usual late night sound of laughter or arguments (usually the latter) was replaced by this frighteningly eerie silence. 

Seeing my phone was nearing the end of its battery life, I glanced around for an outlet when my eyes met those of the man in the booth across me. His hunched shoulders were cloaked in a dirty plaid shirt, and I assumed he might have been one of the rodeo boys. He wasn’t terribly old, maybe in his fifties at most, but the weariness of his features aged him. He stared at me momentarily, a slight crustiness to his gaze, before he returned to his plate of syrup soaked waffles. 

I slid down a little in my booth, knowing I’d soon be phoneless. Well, not the end of the world, I figured. People operated just fine without phones for years. I set it aside and waited for my waitress to remember I was here. 

The lights above flickered, and yet were silent-- none of that fluorescent hum. Or maybe there was, and I just couldn’t hear it among the thunder and hail. It still struck me as unsettling, but my thoughts were interrupted by the work worn face of Marilyn. 

“What can I get you?,” she asked in a monotone voice that added to my increasing unease. She didn’t sound tired, or annoyed, she sounded utterly blank. Almost robotic, but with an inflection of human that made it uncanny.

“Could I get a coffee, and the two egg breakfast with--”  I didn’t get to specify anything about my plate before she was walking away. Must have been a hell of a shift, I thought to myself. Whatever, food was food, I would be fine with whatever I got at this point, as long as it passed the time faster. I just wanted to go home. 

Her shoes echoed as she shuffled off, and she didn’t speak with the cook, she just handed him a plate with random crap on it. Figuring my staring would be rude, I turned back to the window. Luckily, the hail stopped, but the rain was still coming down in buckets. No tornado watch yet. The atmosphere felt oppressively thick, and I almost felt like I was choking on the smells of burnt coffee, bacon, and stale cigarettes. There was an undertone to it though, something I couldn’t place right away. It was oddly….metallic. 

I pressed the heels of my hand to my eyes and took a deep breath. I had to relax. It was just a fucking Waffle House. It was always weird-- that was part of the charm. My growing anxiety was just the storms, right? 

“Good time for a late night meal, huh?” The voice made me jump from my seat. It was the rodeo guy, staring right at me. His voice was low and gravelly and much more human than the waitress’s, yet it gave me even more anxiety. Despite how I’d seen him actively eating, his plate had the same amount of food on it that I’d seen earlier. He had a little smirk on his face, and glanced at the window, as if suggesting I do the same. 

I smiled nervously, wondering why the fuck some random man was talking to me. I was a newer face around this part of the country, and what they called Southern Hospitality still creeped me the fuck out. As if noticing this, he let out a frightening little chuckle before returning to his plate of waffles, his weirdly hypnotic gaze now breaking. 

I looked back out the window, weirdly compelled to, and the rain had downgraded to less apocalyptic now. I could see my car, and a few bodies in the parking lot smoking. I had a bad habit of not locking my doors, so I locked them from my remote to deter any smokers out there who might be interested in my stunning little Nissan Altima that smoked if you drove it longer than twenty minutes. Lightning flashed, momentarily illuminating the parking lot. That’s when I noticed the shadows. They moved unnaturally, and danced only at the very edges of the parking lot.

My heart began to race, but like before, the waitress interrupted my growing unease. A cup of coffee was placed in front of me, its smell warm and familiar. And yet, it brought me no comfort. I tried to ask for sugar and cream, but again, the waitress walked away before I could. Black coffee was better than no coffee, I figured. Taking a sip eased my nerves a bit, and I told myself I was just letting my anxiety get out of hand. I was finding fright in things that were perfectly normal-- for a Waffle House. 

Aside myself and the rodeo boy, there was one other table here. Five people in total, who were silent the whole time. I only knew this because they stared at me as they walked by to leave. No words, no smiles, just vacant staring. I knew I stood out, but it made me feel uncomfortable regardless. 

Rodeo boy laughs once more. “Saw yer plates,” he said, motioning to the window. “Out of state. You’re new here, aren’t ya?”

“Been about six months,” I replied. Did that count as new? Ever since I moved here, people seemed obsessed with the idea of me being from out of town. It felt so unnecessary.

“That’s just a drop of piss in the bucket, son. I’m here every night, and I ain’t ever seen you.” He was right. I’d never been to this Waffle House before. I much more preferred the one on the highway, surrounded by other businesses. This one was more remote, which added to it’s uncomfortable atmosphere. “They’re gonna stare, son. You’re out here dressed as Count Dracula, chokin’ back black coffee. We don’t do cream ‘n sugar, you’ll just have to mature a bit.”

He laughed once more, but I decided not to reply. Why should I? He was a creepy, hulking man who was getting a kick out of scaring and insulting me. It felt safest to pretend he wasn’t there. 

My eyes go back to the window, and in another flash of lightning, I see them again. The shadows. It was as if fingers of darkness were clawing at the edges of the parking lot. I inched closer to the glass to get a better look, when the sound of a plate slamming once again pulls my attention away. My waitress. 

“Syrup?,” she asked. 

It confused me, until I looked down and saw waffles. I hadn’t ordered that. “Oh, this is--”

“All we got,” she snapped. “Syrup or not?”

I nervously shook my head and slumped in my seat some as she walked away. I wasn’t the biggest fan of waffles-- even Waffle House’s-- but hey, food was food. I took a bite, and again looked out the window. The sight made me nearly choke on my food. 

The man was laughing wholeheartedly now, as if my horror was the funniest thing he’d ever seen. The entire lot now was engulfed in the strange tendrils of shadow, and it was pulling at the hedges that perimetered the building. I got up quickly, getting as far from the window as I could in a short amount of time. 

My eyes looked to rodeo boy. “Shut the fuck up dude-- don’t you see that!?”

“See what?,” he mocked. “Oh, hush boy.” His laughing ceased and he pointed at the seat across his. “Your mind’s playing with ya, making ya see shit. Why don’t ya sit awhile and relax some?”

I shook my head and turned to the counter, trying to pay. But it was like the staff was ignoring me. 

“Ah, come on!,” the man teased. “You look like you’d be a big fan of the creepy crawlies that hang out ‘round here! C’mon, sit with me, I can tell ya all about it.”

I still didn’t want to, and every instinct said not to, and yet, it was like he was forcing me to. I was stiff as a corpse as I sat down, and my eyes refused to meet his. They were quite suddenly full of life, like a proud predator who had just caught his prey. 

“They say these woods are haunted,” he said.

“That’s cool…” I murmured, looking for any out to leave.

“The shadows yer seeing, they ain’t real. The trees pull weird tricks out here. No, no, see the real worries in this neck of the woods ain’t no ghosties. There’s weird people.”

No shit. I’m sitting with one.

He then says something that injected ice into my veins. “Yanno, you’d make a fine lookin’ corpse, Hollywood.”

There was an instinct to correct him, wanting to say that just because I was from California didn’t mean I was from Hollywood. I’d never even been to fucking Hollywood. But fear took over, and I tried to inch out of my seat.

“Not a lot of meat on ya, though. But I bet you’re one of them clean eaters, all that plant based shit. I bet that’s like a good, grass fed beef. Ya dig?”

I dug, alright. I once again tried to leave, but now, his hand had a frighteningly strong grip on my own. “I wouldn’t go out there right now if I was you. Like I said, they say these woods are haunted. They say they make people do crazy things. There’s a few families in them there woods, families I won’t ever speak to. They like to wait for the dark--” His voice immediately stopped with the tingling of bells. A new face had just walked in.

He was a tall, thin, utterly filthy man. I would guess that he was a farmer based on his clothing, but it was almost as if he was dressed in a costume to trick people like me who weren’t raised around here.

Rodeo boy in front of me now leaned in close. “That there’s one of em,” he whispered. “You sit tight, pretty boy.”

I had a chance to escape then, as he’d gotten up to greet this freak. But that meant walking right by them, which I didn’t want to chance. This new comer had dead eyes, the kind with no soul in them. I turned away, quietly listening to rodeo boy talk him up. 

“Well, shoot, Todd I ain’t seen ya in, shit, how long’s it been now?” Rodeo boy sounded genuinely friendly now. 

“Not since our Brodie went missin’,” Todd replied. His voice was oddly deep for someone as scrawny as he was. “It’s been ‘bout six months.”

Todd glances my way, and I again feel ice in my blood. “You looks a lot like my Brodie,” he said. “You wanna be Brodie?”

Rodeo boy, takes him by the shoulder and leads him to a table. “Now, Todd, that twig looks nothing like Brodie. You don’t want him.”

Want me? I got up now, knowing this may not end well. I tried to be inconspicuous as I went for the door, but Todd’s voice warned me not to. “You don’t wanna go out there right now. Mama’s out, ‘n she’s in one of her moods. She’s been real hungry, Mason. I dunno what to with her.”

Rodeo boy, aka Mason, told me to sit back down before turning back to Todd. “You gotta ride it out. Yer family can’t keep doin’ this.” His voice dropped to a hush. “One of these days, someone’s gonna catch on. Get her a deer or somethin’, all these missin’ boys is eventually gonna turn back to you.”

It was all clicking. Was this Mama some crazed murder? Was she blood thirsty? Or was it a more literal hunger? 

I didn’t want to stick around to find out. My car was less than twenty feet away. If I ran, I could get in it fast enough to beat it out of here. 

“I wouldn’t try it!,” Mason called after me. But it was too late. I was dining and dashing sure, but I had to get the fuck out of here. Through the rain, I sprinted to my car, and practically dove inside. I prayed for it to start on the first try, for once in my life, and thank god it did. I ensured all my doors were locked before turning on the headlights. 

The sight before me made me scream. An older, larger woman was in front of my car. In my panic, I was struggling to shift into reverse, giving her a chance to hobble to my door. Through the glass, I could hear her wailing, “You gotta light!? You gotta light for my cigarette!?” She was pounding on the window, begging for a light. 

I did not care. I threw the car into reverse and whipped the fuck out of there. I was going about ninety on the highway, wanting to put as much space between me and this Waffle House as possible. It was all a bad dream, I told myself, a manifestation of my anxiety. Seeing my apartment complex in my headlights felt like salvation, and I knew this was all behind me. Now, more than ever, I craved a Modelo. I took a moment in my car to just breathe. Everything was going to be alright, I assured myself. It was all fine. Mason was just scaring me for fun, Todd was obviously mentally ill, that woman was probably on drugs. It was just a weird night. I was letting my fear of storms make everything into a horror movie. 

Once I’d stopped shaking, I started for my apartment. Typically, I never paid attention to anything in the lobby, least of all the mess of papers that littered the billboard. There was usually all the same shit: local ads, lost pets, and missing people. The same things you’d see at a Walmart or a post office, or anywhere else. I’d seen it all so much that it melted into the background in my day to day life. 

But tonight, it caught my eye. A missing person’s flyer with a photo of a guy looking vaguely like myself. Brodie Wells, it read. Brodie. My heart sunk as I ripped it off and inspected it closer. Behind Brodie’s flyer was another, very similarly formatted. Another young guy, looking like an outsider. And another. And another. There were over twenty of them-- all within ten years of age from each other, all not dressing like the townsfolk I'd seen here, and all missing in this area. All last seen around that Waffle House by those woods. They were also all tourists, visitors-- just like myself. I brought all the flyers to my unit with me, laying them all over my floor to get a better look. This kidnapper definitely had a type. Or was it a kidnapper? 

I pulled open my laptop and started researching each name, and everything came back the same. No trace of any of them, and this had been going on for years. Two of them had an ounce more of information on them, as their names were better known. They had public profiles, so there was much more on their case. They were also tourists, but they looked different from the kidnappers' victim type. They were in town for some YouTube video project, and apparently, one recommended they film out the woods in the area after a dinner at Waffle House. For years, nothing ever came up about them, until a hiker’s dog came running out of the woods with a human bone. One that was so smooth, it was as if all flesh had been cooked away. Those were the article's exact words. Soon, another bone was found, and both were DNA matched to a pair of missing YouTubers named Hunter and Isaiah. But that was years ago, and they were never explicitly tied to other missing persons cases. Despite the differences, I found connections. Were these the first victims? Did they put up too much of a fight, perhaps? The one did look a little intimidating, like he didn't trust strangers. Maybe he'd fought back? My heart was pounding and my mind went back to Waffle House. 

Mama’s in one of her moods. What was the mood? Homicidal? Damn it, Mason, that’s not something to ride out! I decided to try and call the police, but my phone was dead at this point. Surely, there was a public phone in the lobby. I raced downstairs for it, but to my dismay, the line was dead. Had the storm taken it out? It had picked back up again, the thunder rattling the whole building as it sounded. The lights flickered before also going out, and now, it was pitch black. The only light came from the occasional flashes of lightning. 

That’s how I saw her, standing in that glass doorway. As shadows unnaturally danced about in the same way they did in that parking lot, I saw her silhouette and a glimpse of her face, but there was no mistaking it. It was the same woman, and my only saving grace was the door being locked from the inside. She was pounding on the glass once more, begging to be let in. 

“Come on, now, boy, you can spare a light!,” she begged, somehow yelling loud enough that I could hear her clearly through the glass. Her fist was pounding on it in a jarring display of strength, sending echoing booms through the quiet lobby. I couldn't see a thing in the dark to find where I was going, and I stood frozen in fear. I was hoping the lock would hold and that the rain soaking her would make her give up. 

A million things ran through my mind. Mason really was a freak, but he was trying to be nice, wasn't he? Was he trying to save me? He seemed to know, and yet, he seemed to have a soft spot for Todd. Was Todd an unwilling accomplice? Were Mason's comments nothing more than to get me to either leave sooner, or pay attention to him? It seemed Marilyn, my waitress, was trying to keep me distracted too. Did they not want me to look out the window? Was that how this Mama spotted me? I lived my life in near constant fear of everyone around me that I missed those who maybe had good intentions at heart. How I regretted that now. 

All at once her pounding stopped, and I thought for sure she was done. But she suddenly pressed her face to the glass, and a long flash of lightning illuminated her unholy grin. She's not human, I thought to myself. She couldn't be. 

“You'd make a lovely corpse!,” she yelled, and it sent chills through me. 

It wasn't just because of those harrowing words. It was because I could hear her much clearer now. The door was open, the glass shattered around her frail, twitching frame. Her skin hung on her like kudzu hangs on an abandoned home, and her teeth were unnaturally large and white as she grinned maniacally. I was frozen before the sound of shuffling glass against the bottom of her slippers pushed me into action. Her eyes shone like a predator’s, and I had to act to live. 

All I could do now was run.

Tips for retail work, please?","I've been bicycling home from work most of the time for maybe a month. 5.5 miles, 30 minutes.

I got an early shift this week and decided to bicycle to work and then take the bus halfway back. I got three hours of sleep after bicycling home, bicycled the 5.5 miles, changed, waited an hour to clock in, then went to work. I work in retail so on my feet, some lifting, but moving all the time.

I was sweaty for about an hour, which I did not expect. I got extreme anxiety, which might have been from too-strong coffee. I left three or four hours early because I felt awful.

Was it over-exertion? I left to see the doctor about a test because I was so anxious about something. I also didn't feel like eating though my stomach was growling, and I felt better after making myself eat.

I've been thinking about this and realized that after bicycling home, I just get in bed, not stay on my feet for eight hours. Also, even when I bus/bicycle 2.5 hours to work, I eat before my shift.

Did anyone else have endurance problems for working on their feet?

They were far too busy being magnificently unruly Highlanders in this forgotten corner of Scotland, where the gloom seemed to have a mind of its own and loomed over everything like a stubborn grey cat.* Nowhere was this more evident than in the curious case of Mr. and Mrs. Hollow-Oak residence.

They were a pair of scotch eggs - golden brown and hard-boiled on the outside, but cracked all the same under pressure of mounting bills and raising their dreadful offspring. Mrs. Hollowoak was thrice divorced. *Though, who's counting?* She was regularly to be found gazing cow-eyed at the television, bottom perched on an exercise ball, rubbing salted caramel fingers across its rubbery curves. With her long crooked nose, she was - oft than not - willing to peck anyone into small pieces of corn if they dared *ush* a word during her sitcom rituals. Mr. Hollow-Oak worked in care, working the lengthy hours of five in the morning to five at night. Each dawn, as the village Song Thrustles were still contemplating whether to bother with their morning announcements, he would travel privately (or rather, drive his rather temperamental Ford) from the curb to the sterile corridors at Gavin Medical Practice.  

It was in this unlikely hollow that the Hollow-Oaks chose to raise their children. All three of them: Hamish, unemployed and vain at fourteen; Adam, impractical and to no purpose at fifteen, who collected rocks illegally and visited stone circles; Dany, twelve years old and unusually lacking intelligence for the youngest daughter. All dearly loved, cherished, and raised by the Hollow-Oaks, but they were scrabbling mouths to feed all the same. 

Their eldest son - *well, merely a stepson to Mrs. Hollow-Oak -* was wild from the very start. Even as a babe at the breast, Hamish's birth mother counted herself fortunate to escape without so much as a nip. *Though he's grown more agreeable with age, the folk of Shin still shudder when they recall how that blond devil once terrorized the village children at their play, sending the little ones shrieking straight beneath their mothers' skirts.* Mrs. Hollow-Oak, saw her stepson’s milky skin, along with his whiff of cotton hair (compared to her lovely natural children’s brown french crops) rather repulsive, in solemn agreement with Shin’s residences. Never was a peep mentioned of the other mother, of course, let alone her name, as she parted long ago, and Mrs. Hollow-Oak bellowed at the slightest mention. *As a child, Hamish remembers - very unwisely - inquiring his father where his cotton whig sprung from. It was met with sudden weeping from the hairy knuckled man, before Hamish’s stepmother made him sleep in a tent outside for a whole fortnight. ‘My mother must’ve been blonde, he supposed.*

Mr. Hollow-Oak enjoyed the formality of bacon and scotch eggs, a splash of coffee in his favourite mug. A simple breakfast for a man of simple tastes. Sapped and weathered like an old oak tree he’d been named for, he sought much comfort in routine and in the straightforward mind of his new wife. They didn’t share the complications of their first marriages. When they argued, it was about their bills, about his pub crawls or her hen nights, it was honest and familiar. It was exactly how he liked it. Though, on this partially morning, Mr. Hollow-Oak’s eyelids fluttered open to the sight of Mrs. Hollow-Oak crazed enthusiasm - like some deranged kangaroo - shaking family photos from shelves and nearly cracking the television set as she lunged her way forward. ‘One, two, to the left!’ exclaimed the fitness instructor on the screen, who had turned his wife into this morning monster that almost flattened poor Adam. *A little early for that,* he thought, *Susan usually exercises when I’m at work.* When checking the hour, Mr. Hollow-Oak gasped at where the hands pointed to on the bedside alarm. *Twelve O’clock in the afternoon?! No, no, no…* He always waved a fat finger at the other nurses arriving late. Almost like another father figure, just a very disappointed one. *This can’t be possible!* But it must’ve been. *It can't be!* But it was. He strained to follow his wife’s back and forth, but eventually caught her firmly on the shoulders.

Not Anymore! - She had a wedding dress ready as she waited for him to say the words she'd been longing to hear - A Walk Through Every Chapter, My Heartfelt Thoughts, and How to Join the Journey","Yvonne Jamison was ready to get married after dating Jared Ford for seven years.

She had a wedding dress ready as she waited for him to say the words she'd been longing to hear.

Jared was Yvonne's first love and childhood friend. From campus to the workplace, she'd loved him so much she lost herself, becoming nothing more than his shadow.

…

Rumors were swirling in their social circle just days ago. Yvonne's close friends warned her to be careful because Jared was getting too close to Shirley Ember, the young woman in college he'd been sponsoring.

Yvonne was making an appointment for her premarital checkup in the hospital when she ran into Jared, who was supposed to be in a meeting.

He'd accompanied Shirley for her pre-employment checkup and was anxiously comforting her as she teared up from a blood test.

With a trembling hand, Yvonne threw away the final postponed checkup slip.

…

""Have you given any more thought to the blind date I mentioned last time, Yvvy? Simon Quillan's nephew just returned from abroad, and he's been wanting to set the two of you up,"" Lily Tanning, Yvonne's mother, carefully asked from the other end of the line.

When Yvonne remained silent, Lily quickly changed her tone. ""I'll turn him down if you really don't want to meet him.""

""Mom, you can tell Mr. Quillan that I'll attend the blind date,"" Yvonne replied calmly.

""Are you really agreeing to the blind date?"" Lily was surprised. She'd expected Yvonne to turn it down firmly like the last time. Worried, she asked, ""Will you have time? Didn't you say your job as a secretary keeps you busy?""

Yvonne replied, ""I'm no longer a secretary anymore. I transferred to a different department, so I can leave on time now. Just let me know when the blind date is set.""

After ending the call, she took the gift bag she'd picked up from the mall counter and got out of the car.

…

The banquet hall on the hotel's fifth floor was elegantly decorated. Jared had specially arranged tonight's lavish buffet to celebrate Shirley's new job.

Shirley was surrounded by a crowd as she stood in a white Dior cocktail dress, a tiara resting on her head. She looked every bit like a beloved princess.

Her colleagues playfully urged her to toast Jared, and she bashfully linked arms with him before they clinked their glasses.

However, she couldn't hold her wine well and drunkenly collapsed into his arms after drinking half a glass.

At that moment, someone noticed Yvonne entering the hall. Their expressions stiffened. ""Hello, Yvonne.""

The lively atmosphere fell silent in an instant.

With a flushed face, Shirley struggled to get away from Jared's arms. However, he pulled her even closer, not at all fazed.

""Why are you late?"" He completely avoided mentioning how he'd missed the premarital checkup.

Yvonne smiled as she replied, ""It was raining, and I got stuck in a jam.""

Jared took the gift bag from her. ""I promised you that I'd buy you a gift once you start your internship at Ford Corporation, Shirley.""

Shirley opened up the gift box and found that it was a diamond ring. ""It's my favorite ring! Thank you, Jared!""

""Let me put it on you."" Jared put the ring on her carefully, as if he was proposing to her.

The other colleagues were even taking photos at the side. ""You guys just shared a drink together, and now he's putting a ring on you. From now on, you're Mr. Ford's woman, Shirley.""

Jared pulled Shirley closer and whispered in her ear, ""How do you want to thank me?""

She tiptoed and kissed him on the cheek.

Jared smiled affectionately as he announced to everyone, ""Shirley is my secretary from now on.""

Yvonne's breath caught in her throat as memories came rushing back to her.

…

When she was seven, new neighbors moved to the house next door. It was a beautiful woman with a young boy.

He complimented her looks during their first meet. Every day, he'd come find her to play and always held her hand, saying that he'd protect her.

Jared took his promise seriously and protected Yvonne ever since then. He wouldn't let anyone bully her, refused to let other boys look at her, and prohibited her from dating.

The night after her coming-of-age, she drank a glass of wine and shattered the unspoken understanding between the two of them. ""Why won't you let me date? I'm grown up now, and I want to date.""

Jared looked solemn as he cornered Yvonne in a secluded spot. His tone was domineering when he said, ""If you want to date, you can only date me. I've protected you for 11 years, and I won't allow you to be with other men—because I like you.""

Her first kiss was innocent and sweet, sending flutters through her heart.

Yvonne and Jared were inseparable in college. Whenever someone mocked him for being an illegitimate child, she would boldly defend him. She even gave him a rare emerald sculpture to help him reclaim his spot in the Ford family.

Later on, the Jamisons went bankrupt, and Yvonne's father passed away. Lily left the villa and moved back to their old house in the countryside, along with Yvonne and her brother, Ian Jamison.

That same year, Jared was brought back to the Ford family by his biological father.

Everyone thought Jared would abandon Yvonne. However, he hugged her—all sweaty after winning the long-distance race at their college sports meet—and publicly declared, ""Yvvy is my girlfriend. We'll be together forever until our last breath!""

Yvonne was the happiest back then.

After graduation, she gave up the opportunity to study abroad and chose to join Ford Corporation as Jared's secretary. She stayed by his side, day in and day out, watching as he gradually solidified his place as the heir.

She looked forward to the future, thinking she'd marry him; they'd build a family together and spend the rest of their lives with each other.

It wasn't until Shirley showed up that Yvonne suddenly understood why the person who'd once promised to marry her when he grew up refused to utter the same words again when the time came.

It turned out that Jared had a change of heart.

…

""Come cut the cake with me, Yvonne!"" Shirley smiled sweetly as she came over to invite Yvonne.

Yvonne avoided Shirley's touch. Her gaze and tone were cold and indifferent when she replied, ""No need. Your cake has nothing to do with me.""

Shirley hung her head low, her eyes reddening.

Jared noticed her reaction and quickly came over. His tone was laced with irritation when he said, ""Why are you losing your temper with Shirley? It's her first job. So what if I gave her something she wanted the most?

""You asked to transfer to another department as soon as Shirley joined the secretarial department. Since when did you become so willful?""

Jared wasn't patient enough to wait for Yvonne's reply. He dug out a black card from his wallet and handed it to her. ""That's enough. Stop making a fuss. Take this and get your favorite handbag.""

Yvonne felt a pang in her heart. She couldn't help but chuckle bitterly. He'd clearly known what she wanted, yet he'd never thought of buying it for her.

They'd gone from being childhood sweethearts to barely being able to stand each other. They'd been together for seven years, yet they had no plans to marry. Since they no longer loved each other, it was better to just walk away.

""Let's break up, Jared,"" Yvonne said, her voice quivering and her eyes reddening.

Jared's gaze turned cold. He frowned as he said in anger, ""You're the one who wanted to get married, Yvonne, and now you're asking for a breakup. Are you really making a scene over something so trivial?

""I can't always be the one coaxing you. You're the one who wants to break up, so you'd better not regret it!""

""Alright."" Yvonne's breath slowly evened out.

Behind them, Shirley was gathering everyone for a group photo. Jared ignored Yvonne and left.

As Yvonne left the hotel, her phone buzzed with a notification. She opened it, only to find Shirley's new post. The caption read, ""Today is the happiest day in my life, as I've met the most important person to me.""

In the photo, Shirley was surrounded by her gifts, with the ring given by Jared placed in the middle. She'd even made a point to tag Yvonne in the comments section, thanking her.

Yvonne found it almost laughable. She used to care, but now, she didn't anymore. She even liked Shirley's post.

…

Some time past 3:00 am, the drunken Jared stumbled home. The lights were still on inside, clearly indicating that Yvonne had come back and was waiting for him.

""My head hurts from all the drinking, Yvvy. Come give me a massage."" He collapsed on the couch and fell asleep instantly.

The next morning, Jared was woken up by a call from Frederick Manning, his assistant. ""We have a meeting at 8:00 am, Mr. Ford. It's now 8:30 am—are you still on your way to the company?""

Jared glanced at the time, frowning due to the massive headache as he wondered why Yvonne hadn't woken him up.

As Jared's secretary and girlfriend, she always made sure to arrange his schedules perfectly without missing any details.

""Yvonne?"" He searched the entire house, only to realize Yvonne wasn't home.

Jared was momentarily stunned before a mocking smile soon took over his face. ""It seems I've really spoiled her. I'll have to ignore her for a few days to get rid of her entitled attitude. She'll return to me naturally then.""

Chapter 2

It was quiet in the villa. After Jared finished showering, he reached out to grab the clothes hanging there as usual, only to find nothing there. In the past, Yvonne would have already prepared and placed his clothes there.

He paused slightly before going into the walk-in closet and putting on a suit. But after trying two ties, he felt that the colors didn't quite match. In the end, he pulled off the tie in frustration and unbuttoned the collar.

He went to the kitchen downstairs, only to notice that breakfast wasn't prepared. So, he headed straight to the office.

…

It was the first time Frederick had seen Jared having breakfast in the president's office in Ford Corporation.

Frederick stood by the side as he reported work updates. ""The morning meeting has been cancelled, Mr. Ford. It's Ms. Ember's first day at work today, and I've arranged for her workstation as instructed. She will be in charge of your work schedules moving forward.""

Jared looked up and happened to see Shirley, who was dressed in a professional skirt suit, outside. His gaze wavered as he recalled that Yvonne used to occupy that spot.

""Alright,"" he replied.

""This is the list of people in charge of the projects department's exhibitions, Mr. Ford,"" Frederick said.

Jared flipped through the document and spotted Yvonne's name on the list.

He said, ""This jewelry exhibition is complicated and challenging. Now that she's been transferred from the secretarial department, is Yvonne trying to prove herself by planning this all on her own? She's lost all sense of self-awareness after getting used to the comforts of being my secretary.""

Jared had completely forgotten that Yvonne was also a graduate from Alphoria College, just like him.

He continued, ""That's fine. Once she fails to complete the project, she'll realize that the secretarial department is where she truly belongs. Leave a place for Yvonne to come back to, Frederick.""

…

After closing six alarm clocks on her phone, Yvonne finally woke up at 10:00 am—a rare luxury.

She'd spent all night moving her things, called her best friend for help, and hired a housekeeping company to work overtime, just to clean up the villa.

Years ago, Yvonne had wanted to repurchase the villa the Jamison family had auctioned off. However, she'd missed the chance because Jared had unexpectedly changed his schedule.

Later on, he'd bought this beautiful detached villa as an apology gift for her. Although she'd never stayed here, it had been renovated in advance.

It gave Yvonne a huge sense of security to have a house of her own. Apart from this place, she also owned an apartment in the city and a sports car.

Now that she and Jared had broken up, everything she owned would follow her. She certainly wouldn't do something as foolish as sacrificing herself for the sake of moving someone else's heart.

Yvonne was cooking breakfast in the kitchen with her phone on speaker. ""Hello, I no longer want the wedding dress I custom-ordered before. You don't have to deliver it. Just dispose of it, thank you.""

Her best friend, Isabel York, yawned as she walked out. Her throat was parched.

""Morning, I made you some honey water to soothe your throat,"" Yvonne said.

""Thank you, babe."" Last night, Isabel had heard all about how Yvonne had gone from busying herself with wedding preparations to experiencing a sudden, dramatic breakup. She'd cursed Jared for hours until her throat went sore.

Isabel glanced at the time and asked hoarsely, ""Don't you need to go in for work? Or better—have the Fords gone bankrupt?""

""I've transferred to the projects department, and we have weekends off. Besides, I'm planning to quit soon."" Yvonne brought over two bowls of instant noodles with fried eggs. She smiled and said, ""My fridge is still empty, so let's make do with this for now.""

""You always cook the best instant noodles."" Isabel took a mouthful of noodles as she said, ""What are your plans after you quit?""

Yvonne glanced at the old family photos on the table. She took a deep breath before replying, ""I couldn't bring myself to touch jewelry design again after Dad passed away. Do you think it's too late for me to pursue my dream again now?""

""Of course not!"" Isabel grabbed her hands tightly. ""The Jamisons were once the spearhead of the jewelry industry in Jeriton City, Yvvy! Your hands were made for design—not for cooking meals for anyone!""

Yvonne caught her enthusiasm. ""I'm thinking of opening a studio. Are you interested in partnering with me? I don't have enough funds on my own.""

Isabel replied, ""I've been waiting for you to say that. I would've been mad if you hadn't asked me.""

She continued smugly, ""I got half of my ex-husband's assets in the divorce—I can even live off the interests comfortably. I'm confident in your design skills, so let me handle the startup funds. If we're doing this, we're going big! I'll start working on things tomorrow.""

Isabel immediately made a call to place an order for champagne and flowers to be delivered.

Then, they popped the champagne ceremoniously. Still in their nightgowns, Yvonne and Isabel held a glass of champagne each and shook hands solemnly.

""Here's to a successful partnership, Ms. Jamison!""

""Let's get rich together, Ms. York!""

Both of them laughed and hugged each other happily.

…

Yvonne returned to the projects department on the 17th floor of Ford Corporation on Monday. Before the meeting started, she overheard gossip about herself in the washroom.

""Do you think Ms. Jamison's transfer to the projects department is a promotion or demotion? I saw that Mr. Ford already has a new secretary now.""

""Of course it's a demotion! No matter how beautiful Ms. Jamison is, she can't hold a candle to a young and supple female college student.""

""So Mr. Ford dumped her? No wonder people were talking about how he dotes on Ms. Ember. You can really see the difference between the old flame and the new.""

Suddenly, Yvonne opened the door of the cubicle and stepped out. The two female employees who were gossiping behind her back immediately lowered their heads in silence.

She said nothing. She couldn't be bothered to defend herself.

…

Yvonne's exhibition proposal was extremely detailed.

The projects department's manager, Wayne Greene, hadn't expected the newly transferred employee to be anything more than a pretty face. But her presentation of the jewelry exhibition was unique, creative, and insightful.

However, he was surprised to see the resignation letter she'd handed over. ""You're planning to quit so soon after you got transferred to the projects department? Do you want to think this through?""

Yvonne replied, ""I'm resigning due to personal reasons. Don't worry, I'll complete the exhibition before I leave.""

She set a countdown reminder on her phone. Her last month on the job was her way of taking responsibility to finish what she'd started.

…

Jared stumbled out of the gathering with unsteady steps. He took his phone out to make a call.

When a car pulled up, Frederick was the one who stepped out of the driver's seat.

Anthony Locke, Jared's best friend, asked in confusion, ""Shouldn't Yvonne be picking you up?""

In the past, Yvonne had always been there at his beck and call.

""Ms. Jamison has left the secretarial department, Mr. Locke,"" Frederick replied.

Jared's friends stared at him in shock. ""Did you fight with Yvonne, Jared? Aren't you guys in the midst of preparing for your wedding?""

Jared's expression twisted in displeasure as he somewhat sobered up. ""She was the one who got unreasonably jealous and wanted to break up. I couldn't be bothered to coax her.""

Anthony said, ""You guys are childhood sweethearts. It's impossible for you to break up over something so trivial."" He stood beside Jared as he joined the latter in smoking. He then smiled and said, ""Let me call Yvonne up and help smooth things over for the two of you.""

When the call got connected, he put it on speaker. ""Jared is drunk, Yvonne. Can you come over and pick him up? I'll send you the address.""

After a brief moment of silence, Yvonne replied calmly, ""That's not within my job scope. You should call someone else instead.""

She ended the call immediately, rendering everyone speechless.

Jared exhaled a puff of smoke and chuckled. He complained bitterly, ""Aren't you just making things hard for yourself? Yvonne broke up with me because she wanted me to coax her. If you call her, she'll definitely think I'm trying to get back with her. You're just making things worse!""

Shane Thompson pressed on tentatively, ""Aren't you worried that Yvonne is actually angry, Jared? Even if she gets jealous, it's because she cares for you. You should just coax her.""

""I refuse to! She's the one who's being dramatic over nothing this time. Once she calms down, I'll have her come and coax me instead,"" Jared replied.

""Just flaunt it as much as you like, Jared. Everyone knows Yvonne won't marry anyone but you. She's already preparing for the wedding, and you—her groom—are right here. She'll definitely come back and find you!""

Jared was confident that Yvonne would never leave him.

…

Meanwhile, Yvonne received a text from Lily. ""Yvvy, I've arranged a blind date for you tomorrow at 7:30 pm at Brisa Cafe. You'll be free, right?""

Yvonne replied, ""Yes, I'll be there on time.""

Chapter 3

It was Yvonne's first time attending a blind date.

To show her respect, she washed her hair as soon as she got home from work. She then changed into a light blue fringed dress and put on a light touch of makeup before heading out.

Just as she got out of her car outside the cafe, she received a voice message from Lily.

Lily said, ""I've checked for you, Yvvy. His name is Harold Quillan—he's 28 and about five feet and ten inches tall. He works in the marketing department of an international company and makes more than 50 thousand per month.

""He's average-looking, neither fat nor thin, and has an introverted personality. Simon said he's going over after work, and the signal is a white rose on the table.""

Yvonne couldn't help but laugh. Not only did Lily not give her a photo, but she even wanted Yvonne to look for a signal.

The cafe wasn't too packed at this hour. A man in a suit was sitting by the window, with a white rose in the glass of water on his table.

Yvonne felt slightly embarrassed. She took a deep breath before walking over. ""Hello, I'm Yvonne Jamison.""

The man had been lounging in his seat as he browsed the stock market on his tablet. His fingers paused when he heard her introduction, and then he slowly looked up.

Yvonne froze upon meeting his gaze. The man before her wore a tailored suit and sat there with an undeniable air of sophistication. His deep-set eyes held a hint of aloofness, yet there was a subtle, restrained intensity in his gaze.

Was this what Lily meant by ""average-looking""? This man's appearance was clearly superior no matter how one looked at him.

Yvonne realized she'd lost her composure. The man had been staring at her in silence. Could she have mistaken him for her blind date partner? ""Sorry, are you here for the blind date tonight?""

Samuel Hover subtly lowered his gaze and smiled faintly. ""Yes. Please have a seat, Ms. Jamison.""

As soon as Yvonne sat down, she noticed the half-empty coffee cup on the table. She then glanced at the time, noting that it wasn't 7:30 pm—their meetup time—yet. She wondered if she was late.

Samuel noticed her actions and quickly said, ""I came earlier. What would you like to drink, Ms. Jamison?""

Yvonne wasn't expecting him to be this attentive. ""I'll have a look at the menu.""

She ordered a mocha and a slice of cake. It was unnervingly quiet.

Yvonne wasn't sure what to talk about on a blind date, and the man before her wasn't inclined to speak either. She could only sense his uneasiness from his uneven breaths. It was probably also his first time attending a blind date, and he was equally nervous.

She recalled Lily saying that he was introverted, so she wondered if she should get the ball rolling.

Yvonne glanced at the stock market on the tablet and asked, ""I've heard that you just came back from abroad. How have you been adjusting? You must be busy at work.""

""Work is fine. I'm just adjusting to the time difference—I've been craving coffee in the evenings."" Samuel's breath evened out eventually. His gaze met hers—calm, without intrusive curiosity. He maintained a gentle, polite demeanor.

""What do you do for work now, Ms. Jamison?"" he then asked.

Yvonne was surprised Lily hadn't told him of her situation.

She smiled and replied, ""I'm in charge of exhibition planning in the projects department. This is my business card, but I've just resigned—I'm planning to set up a studio.""

Samuel took Yvonne's business card, looked down at it, and lightly traced her name with his fingertip. ""I'm sorry, I didn't bring my business card today.""

""It's alright.""

Her gaze was suddenly drawn to his long fingers. Only then did Yvonne realize that the watch on his wrist was a limited edition worth millions from a high-end brand. Even the suit he wore was a custom-tailored Armani suit.

It seemed a little different from what Lily had told her. She wondered if he came from a wealthy family but didn't feel comfortable asking him about it.

At that moment, the waitstaff brought Yvonne's coffee and cake. The table was full of things.

As Yvonne lowered her head, she caught a glimpse of Samuel picking up an ashtray. Albeit surprised, she politely said, ""It's alright.""

He met her gaze. ""I don't smoke.""

It turned out he was just naturally putting aside the items. Yvonne couldn't help but smile and nodded. ""Thank you.""

She really hated secondhand smoke. Her hair and clothes would often smell of smoke whenever she headed home, so she had to wash her hair before bed. It annoyed her to no end that she had to dry her hair in the middle of the night.

""You mentioned that you're planning to set up a studio, Ms. Jamison. What is it for?"" Samuel asked.

Yvonne replied, ""I'll be working on my childhood dream—jewelry design.""

She'd expected this blind date to be incredibly awkward. He was slow to warm up, but once they started talking, he was the one asking all the questions—and they were all polite inquiries.

Samuel noticed his phone on the table lit up. He frowned before saying, ""I have something to take care of, Ms. Jamison. I'll be taking my leave now.""

""Alright, let's add each other on WhatsApp then,"" Yvonne said.

She wasn't expecting his profile photo to be of a kitten, and his name was just a simple ""H"". She saved his contact as ""Harold (blind date)"".

Samuel stood up and extended his hand. ""It's a pleasure to meet you, Ms. Jamison. Let's grab a meal next time and continue our conversation.""

Yvonne looked up and met his gaze. As they shook hands, she could feel his grip tighten briefly before loosening. ""Alright, see you.""

It was probably the usual procedure for blind dates. They wouldn't necessarily meet again.

A black car limousine was parked by the street outside the cafe. ""Did someone… just hit on you earlier, Mr. Hover?""

""It's someone I haven't seen in a long time."" Samuel tucked Yvonne's business card away before he got into the car.

…

In the president's office at Ford Corporation, Frederick noticed that Jared hadn't been wearing a tie these past few days. It seemed like he wasn't in a good mood either.

After a meeting, Jared dialed the internal line for the secretarial department. ""Bring me a cup of coffee.""

Shirley stepped in wearing a professional skirt suit. She couldn't take her eyes off Jared, who looked captivating as he handled documents behind his desk.

She walked closer and bent down, intentionally letting one button of her shirt collar pop open. Jared would definitely notice it from his angle, yet he didn't look up.

""Oh my!"" Shirley pretended to lose her balance and spilled the coffee.

Jared quickly swept the documents away. There was a trace of anger in his gaze when he finally looked up at her. ""Being my secretary is more than just looks, Shirley—your skills matter too. Don't make this kind of rookie mistake in the office.""

In the past, Yvonne had been efficient when handling her work and always set her personal emotions aside. She was definitely his right hand at work.

Shirley's bashful expression froze. She was surprised, as Jared usually enjoyed her clumsy mistakes and would playfully tease her.

""I'm sorry,"" she said with her head hung low, tears brimming in her eyes.

""I'm not scolding you. I'm just reminding you to do your work."" Jared softened his tone and continued, ""Button up your shirt and bring me another cup of coffee.""

""Okay.""

Shirley returned with a new cup of coffee and some biscuits soon after. ""I've bought the best Blue Mountain No. 1 coffee beans—freshly ground and brewed—and paired it with pine nut cookies.""

The coffee had a wonderful scent. Jared took an expectant sip, only to frown and place the cup down. Somehow, the taste couldn't be compared to the coffee Yvonne used to make for him.

""Are there no other coffee beans left in the break room?"" he asked.

""There's none left."" Shirley couldn't understand how Jared was still dissatisfied even when she'd used the most expensive coffee beans.

Jared frowned before gesturing for her to take her leave. He'd been feeling inexplicably tired and irritated without his usual cup of coffee to freshen him up in the past few afternoons. Somehow, he craved Yvonne's coffee.

He wasn't sure what was going on with him.

After a while, Jared dialed Yvonne's number for the first time since that night. The call soon connected.

He said, ""Shirley hasn't been feeling well these few days, Yvonne. The position in the secretarial department is temporarily vacant, and I couldn't get anyone to fill it.""

Jared was confident. This was a great opportunity for Yvonne to return to him—there was no way she would refuse it.

He continued, ""Why don't you temporarily transfer back to the secretarial department to fill in for a couple of days?""

Chapter 4

The other end of the line was silent for a moment. Jared's face broke into a smile as he waited for Yvonne's eager agreement.

However, an unfamiliar female voice stammered in reply, ""I-Is this Mr. Ford? Yvonne forwarded this number to the office. She said she doesn't want to be disturbed during work. When she's back, I'll inform her that you tried to reach her.""

Jared was at a loss for words.

His phone never once rang even as working hours ended. He then took the elevator to the 17th floor.

Wayne hurried over to greet Jared. ""What brings you to the projects department, Mr. Ford?""

In the past, Jared would always make a call whenever something came up. He never came in person.

""I was passing by and just thought I'd stop by."" Jared glanced inside but didn't see Yvonne.

Wayne keenly caught it and said, ""The projects department is understaffed, and the venue and guests for the jewelry exhibition still aren't confirmed. Ms. Jamison has been handling everything herself. Do you need me to call and have her come back?""

A fleeting look of barely noticeable disappointment flashed in Jared's eyes. His face immediately fell. ""Who said I was looking for her? Also, she's no longer my secretary—I have no need for her now.""

Looking at his retreating back, Wayne couldn't understand why Jared had come over personally.

…

Yvonne wanted to make a cup of coffee before her meeting the next day. Just as she stepped into the break room, she saw Shirley rummaging through items with her name on them.

""What are you doing?"" she asked, her voice cold.

Shirley shyly explained, ""You know I'm now responsible for Mr. Ford's well-being, Yvonne. Even though he never tells me off, I'm worried that I might affect his work if I don't do well enough.""

""What's that got to do with me?"" Yvonne glanced at the coffee beans spilled across the table and coldly reminded, ""Even if I didn't teach you, don't you know the most basic manners, Ms. Ember? This is the projects department. If you need to do something, please do it at the secretarial department.""

The commotion in the break room caught the attention of their nosy colleagues, who gathered around to watch.

""Are you still angry, Yvonne?"" Tears filled Shirley's eyes immediately as she shifted uneasily in place. She choked out a sob and said, ""I'm here as a secretary just to repay Mr. Ford's kindness for sponsoring me. I never wanted to take your place.

""I'll apologize to you with this cup of coffee, Yvonne. After all, you've been making coffee for Mr. Ford all these years—no one knows his taste better than you. So please, teach me how to brew it.""

She then rushed over with a freshly brewed pot of hot coffee. Yvonne stepped aside to avoid her.

Shirley ended up bumping into the table and knocking over the coffee pot. The hot liquid scalded the back of her hand, causing a large patch of skin to redden immediately. ""Ouch!""

""Shirley!""

All the rubbernecking colleagues immediately stepped back when Jared showed up.

He rushed over and grabbed Shirley's hand, running it under cold water. Upon seeing her tremble in pain in his arms, he frowned and said, ""Your burn is too serious. I'll bring you to the hospital.""

""It's fine. I was being too careless—it's not Yvonne's fault."" She started sobbing as she explained, ""I just want to learn how to brew a good pot of coffee, Mr. Ford. I'm just too clumsy!""

""I know you're doing this for me, Shirley."" Jared softly comforted Shirley. He then turned to look at Yvonne, who remained indifferent to what was happening.

He grew annoyed and said, ""Is this how you act when Shirley comes to you for advice? Don't bring your personal emotions into the office, Yvonne.

""You're the one who chose to leave the secretarial department, so don't think about going back after you chose to stay in the projects department. The secretarial department has no place for you anymore!""

Yvonne didn't feel angry even as she watched Jared help Shirley out.

What a well-played scene. Shirley was using the same old tricks again. Did she really think Yvonne would care?

""Wait,"" Yvonne suddenly said.

Jared stopped in his tracks, throwing a condescending look at her. ""Have you realized your mistake? If you can correct it and get along with Shirley, you might be able to transfer back.""

""I just want to remind Ms. Ember."" Yvonne smiled and pointed at the break room. ""She should clean this up properly so it doesn't affect our department's use of the space.""

Her words angered Jared. ""Remember what you just said, Yvonne!""

He'd initially wanted to offer Yvonne a way out so she could transfer back to the secretarial department. But since she didn't appreciate it, he'd see just how long it would take before she came back crying in regret.

Jared barked, ""Call the cleaning staff to clean up!""

It wasn't until both Jared and Shirley left that Yvonne's colleagues from the projects department gathered around, curious to see her reaction.

Yvonne took a deep breath and turned to address the crowd. Waving her phone, she said, ""Since we can't use the break room, I'll buy everyone coffee for the afternoon.""

Once everyone had their takeaway coffee, Yvonne called for a meeting. There were six members in her team for the jewelry exhibition. They were currently discussing the guest list.

Someone suggested, ""We could invite Professor Jean Weedle. She's well-known both abroad and in Jeriton City. Having both rising and top-tier designers on the same stage would be the exhibition's biggest selling point, and it fits perfectly with our 'Legacy' theme.""

Yvonne nodded in approval. ""I'll personally extend an invitation to Professor Weedle.""

…

Yvonne arrived at Jean's residence, bringing a fruit basket with her. She sat waiting in the living room.

Upon seeing an elegantly dressed middle-aged woman coming downstairs, she stood up politely. ""Hello, Professor Weedle. I'm Andrew Jamison's daughter, Yvonne. Do you still remember me?""

""I remember you. Mr. Jamison mentioned that his daughter has a talent for design,"" Jean said with a kind smile.

""I'm here on behalf of Ford Corporation to extend an invitation to you."" Yvonne handed over the proposal she'd brought and explained the purpose of her visit.

""I know you've been having some trouble with your eyes recently and even turned down the National Museum Exhibition. I do have a personal reason for inviting you, though—some pieces in the exhibition are your works,"" she said.

Is your business not being found online? SEO could be the key to your silent success!

Hello! Whether you're baking handmade bread in Melbourne, repairing pipes in Dubai, or selling handmade goods online in Los Angeles—your business is built on hard work, dreams, and a lot of love.

But did you know? In today's digital world, having an excellent service or product isn't enough—if people can't find you, your business is like a secret party that no invitations were sent out!

# What is SEO?

Simply put—it's your digital loudspeaker.

When someone searches for ""Manchester's best coffee shop"" or ""Abu Dhabi electrician"" on Google or Bing, SEO brings your website to the top. SEO organizes your website in a way that makes search engines understand—""This business is the most relevant and trustworthy.""

# Why is SEO a small business' friend?

✅ You can compete with big brands: If you target ""halal burgers in New York,"" you can beat even big companies.

✅ More profit at lower cost: Once you rank, you don't have to spend money on each click.

✅ Trust is built: Being on the first page of Google means you are perceived as credible by customers.

✅ Targeted customers come: Only those who want your service find you. This is clever marketing.

✅ Results are measured: With Google Analytics, you can understand which keywords are bringing traffic and which pages people are going to.

How to get started? Put—

Set your goal: Do you want to increase the number of calls? Make sales? Get people to come to the store?

Understand the language of customers: How do they search? ""Cheap restaurants"" or ""Best family dining?""

Create a Google Business Profile: It's free but very powerful. Keep the address, hours, photos, reviews—all updated.

Optimize your website: Does it display well on mobile devices? Does the page load quickly? Does it have a title and meta description?

Create quality content: Write about things people want to know. For example—""How to take care of your hair during the monsoon?"" or ""Easy way to make vegan cakes at home.""

Warning: If someone says, ""I'll make it to number 1 in 1 day""—be careful! Google can also penalize you for this.

Finally—SEO is a test of patience.

Small results are typically observed within 2-3 months, with significant changes occurring between 6-8 months. However, once the results are in, they last a long time. SEO gets you in front of customers, builds Trust, and slowly increases your sales.

This post is for people living near Amsterdam or in the Netherlands. Sorry about it but long distance is not my thing..

I live in Amsterdam and living in Europe for more than 15 years. I am learning Dutch and I’m more confident that I will learn it someday unlike German 😅

I’m a 36-year-old Indian origin, whose father says he is no longer Indian 🤣. Probably because I picked up things from various cultures while living in and traveling to multiple countries, and they really changed how I see and live my life. I’ve light tanned skin, Black hair, Brown eyes, 183cm tall (not tall by Dutch standards, but I can reach things on the top shelf), broad shoulders, slightly muscular, and powered mostly by hugs.

I work in senior management at an international company – fancy title, but still can’t remember name of people I meet.

Now onto the good stuff…

Who am I?

📸 Photography nerd – will lie in mud for the perfect sunset shot.

🏍️ Motorbike rider – nothing beats a long ride with no destination.

🥾 Hiking enthusiast – let’s climb something tall and wonder why we did.

🍳 Lazy-ass cook – food’s great, but I don’t follow recipes, I follow mood.

🍰 Sweet tooth champion – will propose if you bake a great cake.

🏋️‍♂️ Lift weights – Muscles and fitness is as important as eating cake.

✈️ Travel addict – have passport, seen many countries, will explore more. Next dream: settle near water, adopt pets, live slow.

Looking for someone who fit at least one or two things below.

• Enjoys hugs and cuddles like I do oxygen.

• Likes travel, nature, and lazy Sundays.

• Takes care of her body and health (but yes, we can eat cake).

• Is open to pets and future waterside living.

• Love to Bake (or at least enables my dessert addiction).

I love affection – hugs, cuddles, forehead kisses, the whole warm and fuzzy package. I don't enjoy penetrative sex, but show my love/intimacy through touch, affection and closeness. So, if you are comfortable with this and think you can bear with me in real life then send me a message!

Let’s make a life full of adventure, laughter, and cake crumbs.

P.S:  I’m much more into real-life conversations than endless online chatting — I’d prefer to exchange a few messages here, then meet up somewhere public over coffee & cake. So if you’re mainly looking for a many days of online chatting… I might not be your guy. No hard feelings — the internet is a big place! 😄",0,1749664087.0,R4R30Plus,0,0.33,False

""Sign here.""

James Chancer’s cold, deep voice broke the silence as he slid the divorce papers across the table. Sarah looked up at him, managing a bitter smile.

So this was it. No wonder he'd surprisingly called this morning to say he'd be home tonight, wanting to talk. She'd been happy all day, only to find out this was what he wanted to discuss... Three years of marriage, coming to an end.

Sarah Sanders took the papers with trembling hands, her voice barely a whisper, ""Do we really have to divorce?""

James frowned as he studied the woman who'd been Mrs. Chancer for three years. She must have just finished cleaning - sweat still glistened on her forehead, exhaustion and confusion evident in her eyes behind those thick glasses. Gentle and modest, but utterly plain. This unremarkable woman had been Mrs. Chancer for three years.

James tone leaving no room for argument, ""Just sign it. Charlotte's back, and I don't want her to get the wrong idea.""

Sarah felt a bitter taste in her mouth. She knew exactly who he meant. Charlotte Garnett - James's first love, the one who got away. For her sake, their marriage had been in name only. For three whole years, James had stayed faithful to Charlotte's memory.

Worried she might refuse, James added coldly, ""It's an uncontested divorce. Given your limited education, you'll get the mansion properties and cars. I'll also add eighty million as compensation.""

They'd only married to please his grandfather, with a prenup in place. What James offered far exceeded what she was entitled to. Though he never cared for her, Sarah had tried her best these three years. The extra compensation acknowledged her dedication, especially since she'd need support after divorce with just a high school diploma.

Sarah understood his meaning. After reviewing the papers, she quietly nodded, ""Alright, I agree.""

She signed her name smoothly, looking at James through her thick lenses with an expression caught between bitterness and resignation. ""Don't worry, I'll move out in a couple of days. I won't get in your way.""

James nodded, ""Thank you for everything these past three years.""

Despite how plain and boring she might be, he had to admit Sarah had been a good wife. She'd taken care of his entire family while he focused on his career, letting him pursue success without worry. But in the end, you can't force love.

Sarah found it darkly amusing - after giving him everything, wasting three years of her youth, all she got was a simple ""thank you.""

James didn't notice her bitter smile as he took the signed papers. His assistant called, and he glanced at her, ""I have work at the office. Ask Mrs. Watsons if you need anything.""

Sarah nodded.

As James left the study, his mother anxiously met him in the living room. ""How did it go? Did she sign?""

James frowned slightly, then nodded.

His mother sighed in relief, delighted, ""Thank goodness! These past years since you married her, I've never felt at ease. Three years without a child, always so quiet - who knows what she was really thinking.""

James stayed silent.

His mother continued, ""I opposed it when your grandfather insisted you marry her. What good could come from an orphan living off the Larson family's charity? Now it's sorted - once you marry Charlotte, I can finally relax. Only someone like Charlotte deserves you.""

James's sister Lucy nodded eagerly, ""Exactly, brother. Having her as a sister-in-law was embarrassing. Now with Charlotte as my sister-in-law, everyone will be jealous.""

Chapter 2

Sarah listened to the conversation outside the study, her eyes downcast.

During her years as James’s wife, she had given everything to her mother-in-law and sister-in-law Lucy. When Lucy had her car accident, Sarah had stayed at the hospital for days. She'd always shown nothing but respect and care for Mrs. Chancer. Yet it seemed no amount of devotion could change how the Chancer family saw her.

Shortly after, Scarlett Larson called, her voice tired, ""Sasa, are you sure you won't come? You used to love hunting outdoors, and you'd get to race cars too.""

Sarah froze. Memories she'd buried deep came flooding back. Before marrying James, she'd loved hunting, racing cars, and good wine. Then she met James at the Larson estate and fell head over heels. After falling for him, she learned through others that James preferred gentle, trad wife. So she'd gradually given up everything she loved.

Three years had passed, and she'd almost forgotten who she used to be.

On the other end of the line, Scarlett continued rambling, ""Sasa, if you don't want James to know, you can keep it from him. There's no need to give up everything for a man. Besides, James...""

""We're getting divorced,"" Sarah cut her off quietly.

Scarlett seemed stunned, then took a deep breath, ""Did you finally come to your senses, or did James lose his mind?""

Sarah gave a small laugh, ""He asked for it. I agreed.""

Scarlett was speechless, thinking James must be blind. The Chancers should have counted their lucky stars to have someone like Sarah, and now they were divorcing?

""Congratulations, babe!"" Scarlett's voice turned excited. ""I'll pick you up soon. We should celebrate you finally seeing clearly.""

Sarah hung up with a bitter smile. She looked around the master bedroom, which showed no signs of being shared by a couple. After three years of marriage, it might as well have belonged to a single person.

It really was time to end this.

Sarah went to the guest room to pack her things. She didn't have many clothes - after marriage, she'd stopped caring about her appearance - so packing didn't take long.

She removed her wedding ring and placed it on the bedside table, her eyes reflecting a mixture of regret and relief.

As she pulled her suitcase toward the door, she passed through the living room. She thought she should at least say goodbye to her former mother-in-law, but Lucy's bitter voice cut in first.

""Someone is finally leaving. Know your place - hanging around our family all these years just for money. You're nothing but a sparrow trying to fly with the eagles…”

Sarah stopped in her tracks and without hesitation, grabbed the glass of water from the table and threw it in Lucy's face.

Drenched from head to toe, Lucy exploded, ""Sarah, have you lost your mind? How dare you...""

Sarah calmly wiped the water droplets from her fingers and replied coolly, ""I dare plenty. I might be a sparrow, but I still have claws.”

Lucy stood there speechless, clearly shocked that this was the same Sarah everyone had pushed around.

Sarah found Lucy's surprise amusing. For three years, no matter how harsh Lucy and Mrs. Chancer had been, she'd done everything perfectly to please them without complaint. She'd always been gentle and patient, quietly enduring their bitter words and anger.

They'd forgotten that before all this, Sarah had been wild and free - drinking, fighting, and living life on her own terms.

She'd put up with enough. No more.

Sarah let out a soft chuckle.

Chapter 3

Sarah left the Chancer mansion without looking back, wheeling her suitcase behind her. Outside, she found Scarlett leaning out of her car window, blowing her a playful kiss. ""Get in, baby! Time to celebrate!""

Though Scarlett called it a celebration, knowing Sarah was freshly divorced and likely down, she just took her to a music-themed restaurant. When she heard James's reason for the divorce, Scarlett couldn't help but scoff, ""Charlotte Garnett again? What's so special about her that James is this obsessed?""

Sarah stirred her coffee listlessly. ""No idea...""

She'd never actually met James's dream woman. Charlotte had already left for abroad when Sarah first met James. She'd only heard that Charlotte was gentle, accomplished, and understanding. When James had fought with his grandfather over her, Charlotte had been mature enough to convince James to let it go - which had led to Sarah's arranged marriage with James.

Seeing Sarah's reluctance to discuss it further, Scarlett changed the subject, resting her chin on her hand. ""Well, at least James was generous - houses, cars, and eighty million...""

She glanced at Sarah and sighed. ""Though I suppose you don't need any of it.""

After Sarah's father end life, she'd handed the company management to her cousin Melvin Sanders, content to live off the dividends. Everyone assumed the company belonged to Melvin now, and with the prenup between Sarah and James, her family thought she had nothing left.

""You can never have too much money,"" Sarah replied absently.

Looking at her friend’s plain and boring appearance, Scarlett felt a pang of sympathy. ""That's right! Buy yourself some nice clothes and bags, show the Chancers what they're missing! But what are you planning to do now?""

Sarah's gaze grew distant. She had double-majored in psychology and music in college but had to take a break when her father passed away, then came three years as a housewife… She had never thought about what would come next.

Scarlett squeezed her hand. ""No rush. Take your time figuring it out. For now, let's go shopping, and in a few days, I'll take you hunting up the mountains.” She winked excitedly. ""And guess what? Zachary Reynolds will be there too.""

Sarah raised an eyebrow in surprise. Zachary Reynolds, the mysterious third son of the real estate empire, wasn't known for joining such events. But her curiosity quickly faded.

After lunch, Sarah wasn't in the mood for shopping. She just handed over her card and had the staff deliver everything Scarlett picked to her apartment.

Before leaving, Scarlett suddenly remembered something. ""Oh, Sasa - I know you've been busy, but Professor Wells hasn't been well lately. You should visit him when you can.""

Professor Wells had been Sarah's psychology mentor in college. She made a mental note to visit him as she headed back to her apartment.

After leaving the Chancers, Sarah had moved into a small apartment near Scarlett's place. It was regularly maintained, making it perfect for temporary accommodation.

But as she approached the building, she spotted James leaning against his car, waiting. A woman sat in the passenger seat - delicate features, gentle eyes, the perfect picture of feminine grace.

Sarah glanced at her sideways. She could see why James would fall for someone like that.

The woman stepped out of the car and walked over with James, her arm linked through his. With a warm, gracious smile, she extended her hand, ""Hello Sarah, I'm Charlotte Garnett.""

Chapter 4

Sarah stopped in her tracks. Her expression remained calm, but she didn't take Charlotte's offered hand.

As Charlotte's smile faltered, James stepped in to ease the tension, ""Grandfather heard about us,” he said in a deep and restrained voice. “He wants you to join us for dinner tonight. Your phone was off, so I came to get you.""

""I see."" Sarah checked her phone - it was indeed dead. She nodded. ""I'll charge it and join you later.""

The message was clear- she wouldn't be going with them.

James frowned. ""I can wait while you-""

""No need,"" Sarah cut him off with a smile. ""I'll make my own way there.""

When he fell silent, Sarah glanced at Charlotte. ""And tomorrow at nine, if you're free, let's get the divorce papers finalized.""

For some reason, James felt unsettled. ""Why the rush?""

Sarah nodded firmly. “Cause it's urgent.""

James was taken aback, his expression darkening as he led Charlotte away.

After a few steps, Charlotte whispered something intimately to James, then turned back to Sarah, her eyes gentle, ""Miss Sanders, I owe you my thanks.""

""For what?""

Charlotte glanced back at James waiting in the distance, tucking a loose strand of hair behind her ear. Her smile was sweet with nostalgia and gratitude. ""When James and I separated years ago, it was just bad timing. When I returned, I thought we'd lost our chance. I know how much you loved him. If you hadn't been so understanding, we might never have gotten back together.""

""You're wrong."" Sarah met her eyes. ""I'm not divorcing him to bring you two together. I'm not that selfless. I'm divorcing him because I don't want to love him - and I won't anymore.”

She'd spent three years trying to be the perfect Mrs. Chancer, and failed. In that time, she probably had better odds winning the lottery than making James love her. Why keep forcing it?

The moment she decided on divorce, she knew she had to let go. Yes, she'd done everything for James, only to have him bring another woman to her doorstep. But Sarah had no regrets.

Charlotte stood speechless.

Sarah considered for a moment, then added coldly, ""Whatever happens between you two is none of my business anymore.""

Dinner was set for eight-thirty. Sarah reached her apartment just after seven.

Maybe it was the relief of leaving the Chancers, but Sarah felt unusually light. After a shower, she put her phone on charge. There was still plenty of time.

For the first time in ages, she picked out a rose-red dress she loved, switched to contact lenses, and put on makeup.

She'd never done this at the Chancers'. When she first married James, she used to wear makeup, but his mother said it was too flashy for a proper wife. James never bothered to look at her anyway.

Now she could do as she pleased. After getting ready, she took a cab to the Chancer family estate.

""This way, Mrs. Chancer,"" the butler said, eyeing her transformation with surprise but maintaining his usual respect. That he was still using her married name told Sarah that Richard Chancer, James's grandfather, wasn't ready to accept the divorce.

She was right.

At the dinner table sat James and Charlotte, with Richard's face dark with disapproval, the atmosphere thick with tension.

Seeing her, his expression softened. “Sasa, come,"" Richard said warmly. ""It's been too long since you've had dinner with me.”

James looked up instinctively, his gaze falling on Sarah. Something stirred in him.

Without her glasses, her almond-shaped eyes were striking, with their subtle upward tilt and gleaming with an inner light. Combined with her rose-red dress, she looked alluring and confident.

Nothing like the meek, compliant woman he thought he knew.

Chapter 5

Lost in his thoughts, James felt a warm hand on his. He turned to see Charlotte looking at him with concern. ""Are you feeling okay? Would you like some soup?""

James shook his head.

After greeting Richard, Sarah quietly took her seat, pointedly ignoring their interaction.

Richard let out a scoff of disgust.

Dinner at the Chancers' was traditionally eaten in silence. Sarah had little appetite but picked at her food to be polite.

After dinner, Richard held her back. ""I've heard about you and James. Don't worry, Sarah. You're the only daughter-in-law this family recognizes.""

He cast a cold look at Charlotte and James, their faces stiffening at his words. ""If anyone should leave this family, it should be the homewrecker and this excuse for a man!""

Sarah shifted uncomfortably.

James's jaw tightened. Beside him, Charlotte clutched his hand, her eyes filling with tears, looking every bit the victim.

Richard ignored them both, drumming his fingers on the table with a sigh. ""Your father and I were close friends despite our age difference. Having you join our family brought me such joy. How can I face your father if we let you go now?""

James massaged his temples. ""Grandfather, I'll make sure Sarah is taken care of. You can't force love...""

Richard's temper flared. ""Force love? You're blind! Just look at who you've chosen!""

""Grandfather...""

Seeing the argument brewing, Sarah intervened softly, ""It wasn't his decision, Grandfather. I wanted the divorce too.""

Her words dropped like a stone into still water.

Sarah poured Richard a glass of water, waiting for him to take a sip before continuing quietly, ""Please don't worry about me. I'm not sacrificing anything. Every decision has been my own. I want this divorce because I simply don't love him anymore.""

Her face was peaceful, like someone who'd finally found freedom, carrying a strange sort of serenity.

James stared at her profile in the soft lighting, his expression darkening.

After a long silence, Richard spoke heavily, ""Our family has failed you.""

Sarah paused, then smiled without responding.

Seeing Richard had calmed, she made her excuses to leave.

Given the late hour, Richard nodded, muttering as she walked away, ""Better off divorced. Better than staying with this fool.""

With a final sigh, Richard retreated to his study without a glance at his grandson.

James's expression grew stonier.

""Go comfort your grandfather,"" Charlotte said softly. ""He's always been fond of Sarah. He must be taking this hard.""

Ever the peacemaker, Charlotte prompted James, who squeezed her hand. ""Let me drive you home first.""

After dropping Charlotte off, James found his grandfather brooding over tea in his study.

He sat down to help, pouring a cup as he spoke with resignation, ""Grandfather, Charlotte will be my future wife. Even if you don't like her, please try to be kind to her.""

Richard let out a disdainful laugh. ""Funny, that's exactly what I told you when Sarah married into this family. 'She's your wife - even if you don't love her, treat her well.' And what did you do?""

Chapter 6

Richard slammed his teacup down, his voice heavy with disappointment. ""Since the day she joined this family, your mother has done nothing but tear her down. Every time she got sick, she had to handle it alone. Whenever Lucy wanted the latest designer bag or jewelry, Sarah was the one footing the bill. Night after night, she'd wait up for you, keeping your dinner warm. And that time you made yourself sick pining over Charlotte? Sarah spent hours making you homemade soup, burning her hands raw in the process.""

He sighed deeply. ""Even when she lost her father and lived with the Larsons, she never had to do any of that. James, Sarah gave you everything. Charlotte brings you one bowl of soup, and suddenly she's the perfect woman?""

James's fists clenched as he listened, his eyes darkening like storm clouds.

Sarah knew nothing of this conversation. For once, she slept well that night.

The next morning at eight-thirty, she called James about finalizing the divorce, ""Mr. Chancer, if you're available, could you meet me at the courthouse at nine? I’ll be waiting outside.""

""I have a meeting,"" James replied flatly. ""Let's handle it another day.""

He hung up before she could respond.

Sarah stood there, stunned. She distinctly remembered reminding him yesterday.

Important people, busy schedules. After a moment's hesitation, she decided not to call back. The great Mr. Chancer could sort it out when he had time.

On her way back, she remembered Scarlett mentioning Professor Wells's condition and decided to give him a call about visiting.

At the Wells residence, the housekeeper led Sarah to the study.

Before she could enter, she heard Professor Wells speaking, ""Zac, regarding your sister's case, I wish I could help. But psychological treatment requires consistency, and in my current condition, I'm afraid I'd do more harm than good.""

Sarah paused as a deep, gentle voice replied, ""Your health comes first. If you could recommend someone suitable, I'd be grateful.""

Just as Professor Wells nodded, the housekeeper knocked and opened the door. ""Sir, Miss Sanders is here.""

""Sarah!"" Professor Wells brightened. ""Come in!""

Sarah looked up, finally seeing the man who'd been speaking. Her breath caught.

He had the kind of presence that filled a room - classically handsome with an air of quiet authority. His chiseled features and enigmatic blue eyes conveyed both sophistication and an underlying intensity. Even standing casually in the corner, he drew attention while appearing completely at ease, like an expertly placed piece of art.

Noting her arrival, he smoothly excused himself, ""I'll visit another time.""

Sarah's interest was piqued, though she had already guessed his identity.

Sure enough, she heard Professor Wells speaking softly, ""It's a difficult situation for the Reynolds. If his sister's condition doesn't improve...""

Just as she thought. Zachary Reynolds, the well known third son of the Reynolds Empire.

The Reynolds family dominated the real estate market on the East Coast, their recent meteoric rise attributed to their CEO, Zachary. The business world buzzed with stories of his brilliance and ruthless deal-making, though he carefully avoided the spotlight. Everyone wanted to know more about the man behind the success.

Sarah hadn't expected to run into him here. She remembered Scarlett mentioning he'd be at tomorrow's hunting event. Looking at him, he seemed an unlikely participant in such activities.

Meanwhile, Professor Wells, hearing about her divorce, felt a mix of emotions. Sarah had been his star student in college before marrying young and abandoning her studies in psychology. He'd always regretted that. Seeing her now, divorced but unbroken, brought him relief.

""You were my most promising psychology student,"" he said. ""If not for the interruption, you might have made significant contributions to the field. Now that you have time, have you considered returning to psychology?""

Chapter 7

Sarah's eyelashes fluttered as she considered Professor Wells's words.

If she hadn't married James, she would've become a practicing therapist by now. Even though her knowledge was still intact, could she really return to her field after all these years?

Professor Wells sensed her hesitation. ""There's no rush,"" he said kindly. ""But if you're interested, I'm here to help.""

""Thank you, Professor."" Sarah felt a wave of warmth. Despite her absence these past years, he still cared about his former student.

After discussing his health and chatting for a while longer, he even invited her to stay for lunch. It was late afternoon by the time she left.

With tomorrow's hunting trip in mind, she picked up her prepared gear and clothing.

The next morning, Scarlett picked her up and drove them to the mountain lodge. They arrived early, finding only a few unfamiliar faces. Since the Reynolds family was hosting the event, it had drawn quite a mixed crowd. Sarah wasn't in the mood for small talk, so she headed straight inside to change and select her rifle.

As she was about to leave the lodge, she heard a familiar voice,

""James, Charlotte! I didn't expect to see you here. I thought this wasn't your kind of thing?""

""Charlotte heard the game hunting was good here. Thought we'd check it out.""

Sarah's heart skipped a beat. She opened the door to find James's friend greeting the couple enthusiastically.

Seeing her, he blurted out, ""Sarah! What are you doing here?"" He immediately regretted it, watching James's face darken.

Sarah had pulled her hair back and wore no makeup. Without her glasses, wearing contacts instead, she stood in fitted hunting gear that gave her an air of confident competence.

James had never seen her like this. His brow furrowed. ""What are you doing here?""

Scarlett, now changed into her own gear, shot James a withering look. ""What's the problem? You can parade around with your side piece, but Sarah can't come here to change her mood?”

""James didn't mean it like that,"" Charlotte interjected smoothly. ""It's just... they're divorced now. For Sarah to show up here, not knowing how to hunt, clearly following James... it's a bit inappropriate, don't you think?""

As Charlotte spoke, not only did James's expression turn disgusted, but whispers spread through the crowd. The other wealthy guests, all somewhat familiar with James and Sarah's situation, were drawing their own conclusions. James had never publicly acknowledged Sarah during their marriage, and now here she was, seemingly stalking him after their divorce. It looked desperate.

Scarlett exploded. ""Listen here, you little-""

Sarah caught her arm, holding her back. She turned to Charlotte and James with a cool smile. ""You've got it wrong. I'm here to hunt...""

She loaded her rifle with practiced ease, her tone casual but sharp. ""Not only can I hunt, I'm quite good at it. If you don't believe me, just watch...""

Suddenly, the crowd fell silent except for approaching footsteps. Zachary walked toward them, a smile playing on his lips.

He took a state-of-the-art rifle from one of his staff and offered it to Sarah. ""The latest model. I'm looking forward to seeing your skills, Miss Sanders.""

His blue eyes held an intensity that matched his enigmatic smile, both captivating and dangerous.

The building is 6 floors and from what I can tell more than half are empty, the parking lot never seems to be more than 10% full.

This isn’t to say that I think the suburban office park is some kind of cultural fixture necessarily worth saving, but it’s so weird that something that takes up so much space has such increasingly little real use, and even weirder that no one seems to have much interest in replacing it with anything else.

1l8yver,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hot_Romance_Stories/comments/1l8yver/the_heartbreak_prescription_one_night_stanley/,"The Heartbreak Prescription - One night, Stanley received the divorce papers from Wendy. Her reason for wanting to get a divorce was due to his failing potency","# Every Chapter Uncovered, My Honest Thoughts, and the Way to Read It

One night, Stanley received the divorce papers from Wendy. Her reason for wanting to get a divorce was due to his failing potency. Seeing him approach, Wendy smiled gracefully and asked, “Stanley, are you here for an andrology consultation?”

One day, Wendy discovered that her husband Stanley was having an affair.

He had been seeing a college student.

It was Stanley's birthday. Wendy had prepared a table full of dishes early in the day. Just then, she heard a notification from his phone.

Ding!

He had left his phone at home.

Wendy switched it on and saw a text from the college student.

\[I hurt myself when I was carrying the cake. It hurts so much.\]

Attached was a selfie—not of the sender's face, but of her legs. The girl in the photo wore pulled-up white socks, black leather shoes, and a blue-and-white skirt that had been pushed up to reveal her long, slender legs. Her pale knees were visibly reddened from the bump. The youthful, vibrant image of her body paired with coquettish words exuded a forbidden allure.

People often say successful businessmen like Stanley favored this type of woman when choosing mistresses.

Wendy clutched the phone tightly, her fingers turning white from the pressure.

Ding!

Another text came from the college student.

""Mr. Hawk, see you at Cloud Hotel tonight. I want to celebrate your birthday!""

So, his mistress wanted to celebrate his birthday tonight.

Wendy grabbed her bag and headed straight to Cloud Hotel. She had to see for herself who this college student was.

She soon arrived at the hotel, ready to go in. Just then, she saw her parents, Harry and Lilian at the entrance. Surprised, she walked up to them.

""Dad, Mom, what are you doing here?"" she asked.

Harry and Lilian, caught off guard, exchanged a glance before responding to her hesitantly.

""Wendy, your sister's back in the country. We brought her here,"" Harry said.

'Jessica?'

Through the hotel's gleaming floor-to-ceiling windows, Wendy spotted her sister Jessica and immediately froze.

Jessica was wearing the exact same blue-and-white skirt from the photo in Stanley's phone. The college student was none other than her own sister!

Jessica had always been a beauty, known as the 'Red Rose of Hovendale,' and she was famed for having the most beautiful legs in town. Many men had been captivated by her charm. And now, her darling sister was using those legs to seduce her husband.

Wendy found it laughable. She turned to her parents and said coldly, ""So I'm the last to know?""

Harry gave a sheepish smile. ""Wendy, Mr. Hawk doesn't even like you.""

""Exactly, Wendy,"" Lilian chimed in. ""Do you know how many women in Hovendale are dying to be with Mr. Hawk? Better to let Jessica have him than some other woman.""

Wendy clenched her fists. ""Dad, Mom, I'm your daughter too!""

Turning on her heel, she started walking away.

Lilian called after her. ""Wendy, tell me—has Mr. Hawk ever touched you?""

Wendy stopped in her tracks.

Harry's voice turned sharp. ""Wendy, don't act like we owe you anything. Three years ago, when Stanley and Jessica were Hovendale's golden couple, everyone thought they'd get married. But then Stanley got into a car accident and went into a coma. That's the only reason we had you marry him instead.""

Lilian gave Wendy a disdainful once-over. ""Look at yourself, Wendy. In the past three years, you've turned into a housewife who revolves around her husband. Meanwhile, Jessica became the principal ballerina of her company. She's a white swan, and you're just an ugly duckling. What do you have to compete with Jessica? Just give Mr. Hawk back to her already.""

Every word felt like a knife into Wendy's chest. Tears filling her eyes, she walked away.

\-

Back at the villa, night had fallen. Wendy had sent the maid Mathilda home, so the house was empty, dark, and cold.

She sat alone at the dining table.

The once-warm meal had gone cold. The cake she had carefully prepared had 'Happy Birthday, Honey' written on it in frosting.

It was glaringly ironic, just like her existence—a complete joke.

Stanley and Jessica had been the golden couple of Hovendale, with Jessica as Stanley's cherished 'Red Rose.' But three years ago, a sudden car accident left Stanley in a vegetative state and Jessica disappeared entirely.

That was when the Crone family brought Wendy back from the countryside and forced her to marry Stanley in Jessica's place. Wendy had agreed willingly when she found out it was Stanley—the man she had loved all along.

For three years, Stanley remained in a coma. During those years, Wendy devoted herself to caring for him. She stayed by his side, gave up socializing, and focused solely on nursing him back to health, living as a dutiful housewife. In the end, her efforts paid off. Stanley woke up.

Wendy lit the candles on the cake.

The flickering glow illuminated her reflection in the nearby mirror—a plain housewife in a dull black-and-white dress, devoid of charm or excitement.

Meanwhile, Jessica, now a successful ballerina, was young, vibrant, and beautiful.

Wendy was an ugly duckling, while Jessica was the white swan.

After waking up, Stanley abandoned the ugly duckling and returned to the white swan's side.

Wendy let out a bitter laugh.

This wasn't love; it was self-delusion. Stanley had never loved her, but she had loved him. The first one to fall in love always lost.

Today, Stanley had made her lose completely.

Tears welled in her eyes as she blew out the candles, plunging the villa back into darkness.

Just then, two bright headlights pierced through the night. Stanley's car sped up the driveway and came to a halt on the lawn.

Wendy's eyelashes quivered. He had come back. She had thought he wouldn't return tonight.

The villa door opened and Stanley stepped in, carrying the cool air of the night with him.

Stanley Hawk, the heir of the Hawk family, had been a business prodigy from a very young age. By 16, he had earned dual master's degrees from Harfield. Later, he took Hawk Group public in Hawthorne, making a name for himself internationally before returning home to lead the company as Hovendale's wealthiest man.

Stanley walked in.

""Why didn't you turn on the lights?"" he asked in a deep, magnetic voice as he turned on the wall lamp with a click.

The sudden brightness made Wendy blink. When her eyes adjusted, she looked at him.

Dressed in a custom-tailored black suit, Stanley exuded a cold, aristocratic elegance that left countless socialites dreaming of him at night.

""It's your birthday,"" she said.

Stanley's handsome face remained indifferent as his gaze swept lazily over the dining table. ""Don't waste your time on this again. I don't celebrate such occasions.""

Wendy smiled faintly. ""Is it that you don't celebrate, or you just don't want to celebrate with me?""

Stanley glanced at her, his gaze impassive. ""Think what you like.""

With that, he turned around and started up the stairs.

He had always been like this—distant and cold. No matter what she did, she could never warm his heart.

Wendy stood and called after him. ""It's your birthday today. I have a gift for you.""

However, Stanley didn't stop or turn around. ""I don't need it.""

Wendy let out a soft chuckle and said, ""Stanley, let's get a divorce.""

Stanley froze mid-step, one foot already on the staircase. He turned around, his deep black eyes locking onto her.

Chapter 2

Wendy was also staring at him. Her tone was light but firm as she repeated, ""Let's get a divorce, Stanley. Do you like your birthday gift?""

Stanley didn't bat an eyelid. ""You're asking for a divorce just because I didn't celebrate my birthday with you?""

""Jessica has returned, hasn't she?""

At the mention of Jessica, Stanley's thin lips curled into a faint, mocking smile. He took a step forward, closing the distance between them. ""Are you bothered by Jessica?""

Stanley, known as the youngest business prodigy alive, exuded an aura of power, wealth, and status. As he approached, Wendy instinctively stepped back, her slender back pressing against the cold wall.

Her vision went dark as Stanley leaned in. He propped one hand against the wall beside her, trapping her between his firm chest and the wall.

Looking down at her with his deep, striking eyes, Stanley sneered.

""Everyone in Hovendale knows Jessica was the one I intended to marry. Weren't you aware when you schemed to replace her and became Mrs. Hawk? You didn’t mind then, so why act all self-righteous now?""

Wendy's face turned pale.

Yes, Stanley had wanted to marry Jessica. If not for the accident that left him in a coma, how could Wendy have married him?

She would never forget the day he woke up. The disappointment and coldness in his eyes when he saw her was devastating.

Since then, they had lived in separate rooms. He never touched her.

He loved Jessica.

Wendy had always known this, but...

She gazed deeply at Stanley's face, the grown man overlapping in her mind with the young boy from years ago.

'Stanley, do you really not remember me?'

It turned out she had been standing in place all along, waiting for someone that no longer existed.

It was enough.

These three years were just her one-sided effort to cherish him.

Suppressing the ache in her heart, Wendy said softly, ""Stanley, let's end this loveless marriage.""

Stanley's brows arched sharply, and his deep, magnetic voice could be heard. ""Loveless?""

He raised his hand, gripping her delicate chin, his thumb brushing against her crimson lips in a provocative motion. ""Is that why? Are you asking for a divorce because of that? Do you want it that badly?""

Wendy's delicate face flushed red like a ripe berry, vibrant and tempting.

That wasn’t what she meant!

Yet his thumb lingered on her lips, pressing and toying with them. She hadn't expected such a composed and distinguished man to have such a teasing, roguish side.

Stanley was seeing Wendy up close for the first time. She usually dressed in monotonous black-and-white outfits, paired with oversized black-framed glasses, presenting herself like an old maid.

But up close, he realized her face was barely the size of his palm, and her delicate features exuded a quiet elegance beneath those glasses. Her dark pupils were stunningly beautiful.

Her lips were soft, their plush surface springing back with a subtle elasticity wherever his thumb pressed.

It stirred an unbidden thought.

Stanley’s gaze darkened. ""I didn’t expect you to be so eager. You’re that desperate for a man, aren’t you?""

Slap!

Wendy raised her hand and slapped him across the face. Stanley’s handsome face tilted to the side from the impact.

Wendy’s fingers trembled with anger. She realized that loving someone too humbly only led to her dignity being trampled on. He had actually humiliated her.

Furious, she declared, ""I know you’ve never stopped thinking about Jessica. Fine, I’ll fulfill your wishes and return Mrs. Hawk’s title to her!""

Stanley’s face instantly darkened, frosty and sullen. A man of his stature had never been slapped before—never!

His sharp gaze locked onto her. ""Wendy, you married me when it was convenient for you, and now you want a divorce just because you feel like it. What do you take me for?""

Wendy let out a soft chuckle. ""A plaything.""

""What?""

Stanley’s expression stiffened.

Wendy forced herself to endure the pain in her heart and said what she knew would hurt him. ""You’re just a toy I took from Jessica. I’m done playing, so I’m tossing you aside.""

Stanley’s expression turned grim, his mood darkening to the point where it could drip with venom. ""Fine! Wendy, you’re something else. Let’s divorce, but don’t come crying back to me, begging for reconciliation!""

He stormed upstairs, slamming the study door shut with a deafening bang.

Wendy felt as though all the strength had been drained from her body. Slowly, she slid down the wall, crouching on the carpet. Hugging her knees, she whispered to herself, 'Stanley, I won’t love you anymore.'

\-

The next morning, Mathilda entered the study.

Stanley was seated at his desk, reviewing documents. He was a notorious workaholic.

""Sir,"" Mathilda greeted Stanley cautiously.

Stanley didn’t even look up. His icy aura hinted at his foul mood. It felt cold being around him.

Mathilda carefully placed a cup of coffee by his hand. ""Sir, this coffee was made by Mrs. Hawk.""

Stanley’s pen paused mid-air, his cold expression softening slightly.

Was she trying to make amends?

Truth be told, Wendy was an excellent wife. She cooked to his preferences, hand-washed his clothes, and meticulously managed his daily needs.

Stanley picked up the coffee, taking a sip. It was her coffee—the taste he liked.

But he was still angry.

She had slapped him last night, and he wasn’t about to let that go easily. A single cup of coffee wouldn’t suffice as an apology.

""Did she admit she was wrong?"" Stanley asked.

Mathilda glanced at him hesitantly. ""Sir, Mrs. Hawk has left.""

Stanley froze, looking up at Mathilda.

She handed him a piece of paper. ""Sir, Mrs. Hawk left this with her suitcase and asked me to give this to you before she left.""

Stanley unfolded the paper. The words 'Divorce Agreement' caught his eye.

His expression darkened. He thought she was trying to reconcile.

Mathilda added cautiously, ""Sir, Mrs. Hawk asked you to finish the coffee before signing the divorce papers.""

Stanley glared at the coffee. ""Throw it out! All of it!""

'Sir, you seemed to like the coffee just fine a moment ago. Why don't you anymore?' Mathilda thought to herself.

Without saying another word, she quickly left with the coffee.

Stanley’s face was a thunderstorm, his mood in turmoil. He skimmed through the divorce agreement. She wasn’t asking for a penny—she intended to leave with nothing.

Stanley scoffed coldly. It was bold of her to act like she didn’t need his money. How would a country girl like her survive without it?

It was then that his gaze landed on the reason for divorce, handwritten by Wendy herself.

""Due to my husband’s physical dysfunction, he cannot fulfill his marital obligations.""

Stanley froze, his handsome face turning completely dark.

'That woman!'

He grabbed his phone and dialed Wendy’s number.

The line connected, and Wendy’s voice came through clearly. ""Hello?""

Chapter 3

Stanley's thin lips curved into a frosty arc. ""Wendy, get back here immediately!""

Wendy chuckled. ""You expect me to come back just because you said so? We're divorced, Stanley. I'm not going to continue indulging you!""

Stanley clenched his jaw. ""I'll give you a chance to rewrite the reason for divorce!""

Wendy's tone grew more playful.

""Did I write anything wrong? Stanley, it's been six months since you woke up, hasn't it? Yet, in these six months, you haven't even held my hand. You were in a coma for three years, and although you're physically healthy now, I have legitimate reasons to believe you've developed functional problems. You're not potent anymore! Better hurry to find an experienced naturopath. As our parting gift, I wish you an early recovery of your manhood!""

Stanley was rendered speechless. The veins on his forehead were visibly twitching.

This woman was out of control.

""Wendy, I'll make you regret this! You'll know what I'm capable of sooner or later!""

""Sorry, but you'll never get the chance!""

""Wendy!""

The call abruptly ended with two cold beeps. He hadn't even had time to explode in anger before hearing the disconnected tone.

'Wendy…!'

\-

Wendy had already arrived at her best friend Cecelia Sunder's apartment. After she hung up the phone, Cecelia burst out laughing and gave her a big thumbs-up.

""Wendy, that was amazing! Stanley must be so furious, he's spitting blood right now.""

Wendy reflected that she had been too humble in the past, which had allowed him to act superior to her for so long.

'Love yourself first. A woman must always prioritize self-love.'

""Three years ago, when Jessica learned Stanley went into a coma after the car accident, she immediately ran away. Now that he's awake, he's crawling back to her? What a joke! You're better off without a man like that,"" Cecelia commented.

Wendy unwrapped a candy and popped it into her mouth. The sweetness seemed to mask the bitterness in her heart. ""That's how you tell if you're loved or not, Cecelia.""

Those who were loved were fearless. Those who weren't lived in constant insecurity.

Cecelia noticed Wendy had already gone through a pile of candies. She pulled Wendy to her feet.

""Wendy, cheer up! When you give up one tree, you'll discover an entire forest waiting for you. Tonight, I'm booking eight male hosts to celebrate you becoming single!""

Wendy covered her forehead and laughed.

Cecelia suddenly snatched Wendy's black-rimmed glasses off her face, tossing them into the trash.

Wendy tried to retrieve them. ""My glasses—""

Cecelia stopped her. ""Wendy, you've been in academic research for too long, and you've gotten used to wearing these glasses. But you should take a page out of Jessica's book and doll yourself up.""

Wendy thought about how her parents had always told her she was an ugly duckling while Jessica was a swan. It wasn't just her parents—Stanley must have thought the same. In his eyes, she was just an ugly duckling too.

Cecelia dragged Wendy to the door. ""Come on, we're going shopping! Hair, nails, clothes—everything! I want Stanley and everyone else to see how stunning you can be!""

As they walked out, Cecelia suddenly remembered something. ""Oh, Wendy, are you really not taking any money from Stanley after the divorce?""

""I have my own money,"" Wendy replied.

""Letting Jessica spend Stanley's money instead? Jessica says thank you!"" Cecelia teased.

Wendy didn't know what to say to that.

""What about the card Stanley gave you?"" Cecelia pressed.

Stanley was always generous and had given Wendy a premium black card. However, she had never used it.

Wendy pulled the black card out of her purse and winked playfully. ""Today, I'll splurge—and let Stanley foot the bill.""

\-

That evening, at 1996 Bar.

1996 Bar was Hovendale's playground for the rich, where young heirs and the city's elites spent extravagantly. The music was never-ending, and the dance floor was wild.

In a luxurious and dimly lit booth, Stanley sat in the center of a leather sofa. Tonight, he had on a black shirt paired with black trousers. His sleeves were rolled up to his elbows, revealing his toned forearms and a steel watch worth millions. His aristocratic, striking features made him the center of attention, drawing glances from countless women in the bar.

Beside him was his close friend, Benny Gondale—the heir of the Gondale family—and several other young elites.

Benny laughed. ""Stanley, are you serious? Wendy wants a divorce?""

The others laughed along. ""Everyone knows Wendy loves Stanley to the bone. When he was in a coma, she insisted on marrying him. There's no way she'd actually go through with a divorce.""

""Let's bet on it. How long do you think Wendy can hold out before begging Stanley to take her back?""

Benny smirked. ""I bet she can't even make it through tonight. She's probably already sent Stanley a message.""

Stanley's chiseled features remained cold and sharp, his mood clearly sour. He pulled out his phone and opened WhatsApp to check their chat history.

The last message from Wendy was from last night. She had sent a photo of the broth with the caption, \[Honey, even though your bone density is back to normal, you should still drink this broth regularly. Don't come home too late!\]

As he scrolled up, he saw countless similar messages—all from Wendy. She messaged him every day.

He had never replied. Not once.

Today, the chat was silent.

Stanley felt a vague sense of irritation.

Ding!

A notification popped up.

""See? I told you—Wendy messaged you!"" Benny immediately exclaimed.

Ding, ding, ding!

Several more notifications followed in quick succession.

The group burst out laughing. ""We knew it—Wendy couldn't hold out! But we didn't expect her to cave so fast.""

""Stanley, open them. Let's see how Wendy is begging you to reconcile,"" Benny urged.

Stanley's sharp eyebrows lifted slightly. Did she really send a message? If she regretted it so quickly, why did she make such a fuss this morning?

He tapped on the notifications, only to freeze.

Benny leaned over and read aloud, ""Dear VVIP customer, your card ending in 0975 has been charged 800 at Dazzling Nail Salon.""

The group collectively frowned.

Stanley scrolled further.

2,000.

86,000.

240,000.

There were no messages about reconciliations, only transaction notifications. The group fell silent, feeling like Wendy had slapped them all hard in the face.

Stanley's expression darkened and he slammed his phone onto the table. He didn't care how much money Wendy spent. What bothered him was that she had gone on a shopping spree right after their divorce. This woman was something else!

The once submissive Wendy, who had clung to him for three years, now seemed to have grown fangs.

""Stanley, what's Wendy up to? She's gone to do her nails and hair, and buy clothes. Is she trying to imitate Jessica?"" Benny commented.

""Jessica is Hovendale's Red Rose. Wendy's just a country bumpkin. No matter how hard she tries, she'll only be a pale imitation.""

""A swan is a swan. An ugly duckling will always be an ugly duckling.""

Everyone laughed at Wendy.

Suddenly, there was a commotion in the bar. All eyes turned toward the entrance.

Someone gasped, ""Look—an angel just walked in!""

Chapter 4

Wendy arrived.

After finishing their shopping spree at the mall, Cecelia brought Wendy directly to 1996 Bar. Tonight, she was determined to throw a celebration party for Wendy.

Wendy hadn't expected to run into Stanley and his friends here, but she could hear their mocking remarks.

She recognized Benny and the others in the luxury booth. They were part of Stanley's circle, and Benny was Stanley's close friend. Back when Stanley had a whirlwind romance with Jessica, they were all fans of Jessica, with Benny even regarding her as Stanley's future wife.

Over the past three years, Wendy had never truly integrated into their group. None of them ever accepted her.

The labels they plastered on her were always the same: desperate substitute bride, ugly duckling, country bumpkin, and the like.

When a man didn't love you, his friends wouldn't respect you either.

Cecelia, already fuming, rolled up her sleeves, ready to confront them. ""I'm going to tear their mouths apart!""

Wendy quickly held her back. ""Cecelia, forget it! We're divorced now—there's no need to stoop to their level.""

Seeing Wendy's calm and indifferent demeanor, Cecelia reluctantly held back her temper. Then, as more and more people began to notice Wendy and exclaimed, calling her an angel, Cecelia's mood improved. ""Wendy, let's go. Time to party.""

Cecelia dragged Wendy to another luxury booth and waved her hand grandly. ""Bring all the male hosts from 1996 Bar over here!""

Meanwhile, back at Stanley's booth, Benny and the others continued to mock Wendy. That was when they felt an icy and sharp gaze fall upon them.

Looking up, they saw Stanley lazily lifting his cold gaze to glare at them.

His expression was chilling, displeased, and full of warning. The men stopped laughing, and they immediately shut up, not daring to speak ill of Wendy again.

Benny glanced at Stanley. Although Stanley had never paid much attention to Wendy, she had, after all, cared for him diligently for three years. It seemed Stanley still held some regard for that.

At that moment, the commotion around them grew louder.

""Wow, what a stunning angel!""

'An angel? Where?'

Following the direction of the crowd's gaze, Benny looked ahead and was instantly dumbfounded. ""Holy crap, she really is an angel.""

The other rich young men were equally astonished, their eyes glued to her. ""When did such a stunning angel begin existing in Hovendale? How have we never seen her before?""

Benny nudged Stanley. ""Stanley, look! It's an angel.""

Stanley, who had no shortage of women around him, wasn't interested. He had seen all kinds of women—slim, curvy, and everything in between. He had no intention of looking, but Wendy's booth happened to be right across from theirs.

When Stanley glanced over, he saw Wendy.

Without her black-framed glasses and her usual dull, conservative attire, she revealed a delicate, fair face, her naturally exquisite bone structure, and ethereal beauty shining through. Her long, glossy black hair flowed gracefully over her shoulders, making her look like a true angel.

Stanley paused, staring at her for two full seconds.

Benny was excited. ""Stanley, what do you think of the angel?""

Another rich young man chimed in, ""Mr. Hawk probably doesn't think much of her. Mr. Hawk likes delicate beauties like Jessica, not cold, aloof angels.""

""But look at her legs! Her legs are just as stunning as Jessica's.""

Wendy was wearing a short dress, shedding her usual conservative style and showing her legs for the first time.

Her legs were perfectly proportioned—slender yet shapely. Those were legs that could make any man's imagination run wild.

She looked just as good as Jessica.

Stanley stared at the 'angel' for a moment and couldn't shake the feeling that she looked familiar, as if he'd seen her somewhere before.

Just then, a line of male hosts walked in, all tall and handsome, forming a row in front of Wendy.

Cecelia grinned. ""Wendy, make your pick of eight.""

Deciding to indulge herself to celebrate her escape from the misery of marriage, Wendy smiled and pointed. ""You, you, you... All of you stay.""

Benny counted aloud. ""One, two, three... Eight! She actually picked eight male hosts at once!""

The other rich young men laughed. ""Why waste money? If the angel just asked, we'd serve her for free.""

Everyone chuckled.

Ding!

Stanley's phone buzzed again with a notification. Picking it up, he glanced at it to see what Wendy had spent on this time.

\[Dear VVIP user, your card ending in 0975 has been charged 500,000 at 1996 Bar for eight male hosts.\]

Stanley froze, staring at the words before raising his eyes toward the so-called angel across the room.

If that wasn't Wendy, who else could it be?

Stanley was speechless.

Eight male hosts surrounded Wendy, pouring drinks into her glass. ""Let's play a drinking game.""

Cecelia clapped happily. ""Yes, let's play!""

In the first round, Wendy lost. One of the male hosts handed her a drink. ""Please drink some.""

Wendy took a sip, but the other male hosts protested. ""Why drink his and not ours? We want to serve you too.""

Surrounded by all the attention, Wendy found it impossible to keep up, overwhelmed by the 'sweet burden' of their pampering.

Stanley's eyes narrowed, his handsome features tensing into a grim expression. Without a word, he stood up and strode out.

Benny was taken aback. ""Stanley? Where are you going?""

Wendy was about to take another drink when a large, strong hand reached over, grabbed her slender wrist, and pulled her up like she was a rag doll. Startled, she looked up to see Stanley's handsome face suddenly looming over her.

She froze for a second, then quickly tried to break free. ""Stanley, let go of me!""

His face darkened and he dragged her away without a word.

Cecelia stood up. ""Stanley, what are you doing? Let Wendy go!""

Benny and the others were completely stunned. They stared, dumbfounded, as if they had just misheard something.

""Wendy?""

""That angel is Wendy?""

""Is this the same ugly duckling Wendy we know?""

""She's actually stunning!""

As they watched Stanley drag Wendy away, her cold, ethereal beauty still lingering in their vision, Benny muttered, ""Wendy, who no longer chases after Stanley, just turned into a full-blown angel!""

\-

Stanley's grip was firm and unrelenting, like an iron shackle. No matter how much Wendy struggled, she couldn't break free.

His strides were long, forcing Wendy to stumble as she tried to keep up. ""Stanley, let go of me!""

Finally, Stanley stopped and flung her backward. Wendy's slender frame collided against the cold wall behind her.

Before she could regain her balance, Stanley's tall figure loomed over her, pressing her against the wall.

His eyes burned with fury. ""Wendy, do you think I'm dead, playing around like this?""

Chapter 5

Wendy furrowed her brows. ""What did I do?""

Stanley clenched his jaw. ""Who told you to dress like this?""

'What? Like this?' she wondered. ""What do you mean, Stanley?!""

Stanley glanced at her ultra-short skirt. ""Your legs are almost exposed. Do you really want people to see your legs like this?""

Wendy's skirt was a bit short, but it was Cecelia's choice.

Cecelia's exact words were, ""My dearest Wendy doesn't show her legs, but look at how Jessica flaunts hers. Tonight, let everyone see who has the best legs in Hovendale.""

Wendy raised her finely arched eyebrows. ""Looks like Mr. Hawk noticed my legs.""

Stanley paused.

Wendy leaned back against the wall, appearing languid and graceful. She slowly lifted her right leg, her crystal-high heel brushing against his ankle.

Stanley had on black trousers, showcasing his long, muscular legs, exuding an aura of coldness and restraint.

Wendy's pale foot gently grazed up his ankle, moving along his calf. It was an act of seduction and defiance.

Stanley shot her a cold glance. ""What are you doing?""

Wendy curved her lips into a smile. ""Mr. Hawk, which do you prefer? My legs, or Jessica's?""

Stanley stared at her small, delicate face that glowed with celestial radiance, yet she seduced him with a dazzling smile.

Last night, he had glimpsed the beauty hidden beneath her dark-rimmed glasses, but he hadn't expected her to be this beautiful.

He felt like he had seen this face somewhere before.

Wendy's clear eyes sparkled. ""Mr. Hawk, has Jessica ever wrapped her legs around your waist?""

Stanley's breath hitched. His handsome face moved closer to hers, his gaze softening with a tenderness Wendy had never seen before. ""Wendy, are you really this shameless? All you think about is men. You even hired eight male hosts to satisfy your needs!""

He didn't answer Wendy's question about Jessica. That was perhaps the best kind of protection a man could offer a woman.

Their love had been so passionate, full of youthful excitement. Jessica's legs had definitely wrapped around his waist, or else why would he still remember her so fondly?

Jessica was lucky to have a man like Stanley so deeply attached to her. He would never describe her as 'shameless.'

Though Wendy wore a smile, her eyes remained clear and distant. ""Well, Mr. Hawk, your body isn't up to par and can't satisfy me, so of course I have to go out and find men. Let's get divorced quickly. If the first man doesn't work, the next will be better.""

Did she actually say he was inadequate, and the next man would be better?

This woman was truly asking for it.

Stanley reached out, grabbing Wendy's chin. ""Are you trying to provoke me? Do you really want to know if I'm up to the task?""

'What?' Wendy froze.

Stanley moved closer to her lips, teasing, but with words that carried no warmth. ""Dream on. I won't touch you. The one I love is Jessica.""

He loved Jessica.

He didn't even need to say it—Wendy already knew. It stung her heart, the sharp pain spreading through her, though the ache wasn't obvious.

At that moment, a sweet voice rang out. ""Stanley.""

Wendy looked up—Jessica had arrived.

Jessica, the Red Rose of Hovendale, was a beautiful woman with rosy lips and perfect teeth, her body delicate from years of ballet training.

Stanley immediately released Wendy and walked toward Jessica. He lowered his gaze to meet hers, his eyes filled with a tenderness Wendy had never seen. ""You're here.""

Jessica nodded, then turned to Wendy. ""Who's this?""

Jessica didn't recognize Wendy at first.

However, Wendy would never forget Jessica.

Wendy and Jessica were stepsisters, but from completely different parents. Harry, Wendy's father, wasn't her biological father, but her stepfather.

Many years ago, Wendy had a happy family with her real father, Jerry, and her mother Lilian, who were always respectful toward each other.

Her father loved her dearly, always lifting her high. ""Wendy, please be happy always.""

Then, one day, her father suddenly passed away. Harry, Jerry's brother, moved in with his daughter Jessica. Wendy's mother became Jessica's mother as well.

Her mother remarried her second uncle. Her mother loved Jessica and stopped loving her.

When Jessica got an A in a test and Wendy got an A+, her mother hit her hand with a ruler. ""Can't you give your sister a break? Why must you outdo her?""

When Jessica fell ill and had to undergo chemotherapy, her head had to be shaved. She cried, saying she had become ugly.

In response, Wendy's mother immediately shaved Wendy's head. ""You should look the same as your sister so she won't cry.""

Every night, her mother, Jessica, and Harry would sleep together, laughing and playing.

Wendy, holding the doll her late father had bought her, would stand outside their door, crying alone. ""Mommy, I'm scared…""

Eventually, Jessica called her mother ""Mom,"" which made her mother incredibly happy. But then Jessica said, ""A mother can only have one daughter.""

One rainy day, Wendy's mother took her to the countryside and left her there.

Wendy chased after the car, crying uncontrollably.

""Mommy, don't leave me! I'll be good, I'll always put my sister before me… Mommy, hold me… I'm scared…!""

Wendy fell heavily into the muddy water while holding her doll, watching helplessly as her mother's car disappeared from view.

Wendy would never forget Jessica.

At that moment, Benny rushed over. ""Jessica, this is…your sister, Wendy!""

Jessica was stunned. ""You're Wendy?""

Wendy knew that Jessica had always looked down on her.

When they were young, Jessica had always been the one to beat her. As Jessica grew up, she excelled in everything. Later, she even dated Stanley, the heir of the Hawk family. She grew up in a world of admiration and love, full of pride and arrogance.

Benny, once again, was stunned by Wendy's ethereal beauty. He whispered, ""I didn't expect Wendy to be this beautiful.""

Jessica's memory of their childhood was fuzzy because she had never truly paid attention to her unloved sister. But wasn't her sister the ugly duckling from the countryside?

Jessica approached Wendy, glancing at her, her brow raised in haughty pride. ""Wendy, I didn't expect you to start dressing like me.""

Wendy remained silent. 'Well, if you say so,' she thought.

Wendy straightened her slender back, smiling but saying nothing. The light from the corridor illuminated her delicate, otherworldly face, making it glow like a precious pearl.

She was no longer the Wendy from before.

Jessica sneered. ""Wendy, I heard you're getting a divorce with Stanley. Can't you live without a man? Coming to a bar to hire male hosts to fulfill your desires? If I were you, I'd get a job.""

As she spoke, Jessica glanced at Stanley. In a tone that seemed almost benevolent, she added, ""Stanley, Wendy took care of you for so long. Even if she was your maid, you should at least find her a job.""

Stanley's gaze landed on Wendy's face.

""Jessica, nowadays, you need a degree to get a job. What's Wendy's education?"" Benny said.

Jessica seemed to recall something amusing. She lifted her chin and laughed.

""Wendy dropped out of school at 16.""

Chapter 6

Benny was stunned. '16 years old?'

The reason people in Benny's social circle held Jessica in such high regard wasn't just because of her beauty. It was also because of her exceptional academic achievements. She was a high achiever at a prestigious university, someone unmatched even among Hovendale's socialites.

She deserved to be with Stanley.

For any woman, beauty alone was a dead end. Beauty combined with education was the real trump card. The higher the social class, the more they valued a woman's education.

Benny's initial admiration for Wendy vanished instantly. His tone became dismissive. ""Wendy, did you seriously drop out of school at 16?""

Wendy glanced at Jessica, who stood there with pride, and smiled faintly. ""Yes, I did stop studying at 16.""

Benny sneered, ""Well, what a coincidence. Stanley also stopped studying at 16. But he's a true prodigy, earning dual master's degrees from Harfield at that age and making history. And you? Dropped out of high school with nothing to your name!""

His mockery echoed loudly.

Jessica stood tall, looking down at Wendy with disdain.

Stanley, with his tall and imposing figure, stood silently under the corridor lights. His handsome face remained unreadable as his gaze fell on Wendy.

For the past three years, Wendy had been just a housewife, revolving around him. It was no surprise she lacked education.

Wendy, however, didn't seem embarrassed or flustered. Instead, her clear, luminous eyes met his gaze. Then she smiled gracefully and said, ""Yes, what a coincidence.""

'Indeed, what a coincidence.'

For reasons he couldn't explain, Stanley felt a ripple in his heart.

He suddenly noticed how beautiful Wendy's eyes were—brimming with vitality and seemingly able to speak volumes without words.

""Wendy!"" At that moment, Cecelia came rushing over. She glared at Jessica. ""Jessica, are you bullying Wendy again?""

Jessica responded proudly, ""We weren't bullying Wendy. We were just discussing helping her find a job.""

Cecelia was stunned. ""You're helping Wendy find a job?""

Jessica continued her magnanimous act. ""Yes. Even though Wendy lacks education and qualifications, we'll try our best to help her secure something decent.""

Cecelia laughed in disbelief. ""Do you even know who Wendy is? Wendy is—""

Wendy quickly grabbed Cecelia's arm to stop her. ""Cecelia, let's go.""

Cecelia held back her words, but before leaving, she cast a mocking glance at Jessica. ""You'll regret this someday!""

With that, she led Wendy away.

Benny fumed, ""What's wrong with Wendy? She dropped out of school at 16 and still acts so arrogant! If I were her, I'd be too ashamed to show my face.""

The aroma of fresh stroopwafels drifting through your hotel window. The soft golden light filtering through tall, narrow glass panes as Amsterdam awakens. These are the moments that transform a simple hotel stay into something magical, and trust me, I've learned this through years of exploring every corner of this enchanting city.

I still remember my first Amsterdam hotel disaster – a cramped room above a noisy pub where the walls were so thin I could hear every conversation in Dutch. But that experience taught me something invaluable: in a city as special as Amsterdam, where you stay doesn't just affect your comfort; it shapes your entire experience. The right hotel becomes your gateway to understanding this captivating city's soul.

# Why Your Amsterdam Hotel Choice Shapes Everything

**Amsterdam isn't just another European capital** – it's a living artwork where every neighborhood tells a different story. The cobblestone streets beneath your feet, the bike bells chiming at dawn, the way morning light dances across canal water – all of these experiences begin the moment you step out of your hotel door.

During my dozen visits to Amsterdam, I've stayed everywhere from luxury canal-side suites to quirky converted bridge houses. What I've discovered is that Amsterdam hotels aren't just places to sleep; they're integral to how you'll experience the city's rhythm. Choose wisely, and you'll wake up to the gentle sounds of canal boats and cyclists. Choose poorly, and you might find yourself in a tourist trap miles from the magic.

The city's unique geography means that staying in the right neighborhood can save you hours of travel time and unlock hidden local experiences that most visitors never discover.

# The Crown Jewels: Amsterdam's Most Luxurious Hotels

# Canal-Front Elegance: Where History Meets Opulence

**The Toren** sits like a jewel on Keizersgracht, one of Amsterdam's most prestigious canals. I'll never forget stepping into their **Golden Age-inspired lobby** – it felt like walking into a Vermeer painting. The scent of polished wood and fresh flowers immediately enveloped me, while morning light streamed through tall windows, casting intricate shadows across marble floors.

What makes The Toren extraordinary isn't just its **authentic 18th-century wall paintings** (though they're breathtaking), but how they've preserved the intimate feeling of a grand Amsterdam canal house. When you open your window in the morning, you're greeted by the gentle sounds of water lapping against the canal walls and the distant chime of church bells – it's pure Amsterdam poetry.

**Pulitzer Amsterdam** offers a completely different luxury experience. Spread across 25 interconnected 17th and 18th-century canal houses, it feels like staying in a charming village within the city. Their **famous courtyard garden** – the largest private garden in central Amsterdam – becomes a serene oasis where you can escape the bustling streets while remaining in the heart of everything.

# Modern Sophistication Meets Dutch Design

The **Conservatorium Hotel** redefines luxury for the contemporary traveler. Located directly across from the Van Gogh Museum, this design masterpiece combines sleek modern aesthetics with Amsterdam's cultural heritage. I spent an entire morning in their **Akasha Holistic Wellbeing Center**, a 1,000-square-meter spa that felt like a hidden sanctuary beneath the museum district.

What struck me most was how the hotel's **floor-to-ceiling windows** frame the Museumplein like living artwork. You're literally waking up to views of world-class culture, and the **museum pass they provide** means you can explore Amsterdam's artistic treasures without planning or waiting in lines.

The newest addition to Amsterdam's luxury scene, **Rosewood Amsterdam** has quickly become the talk of canal-side conversations. Their rooms feature those coveted **direct canal views** that make every morning feel like a scene from a Dutch Golden Age painting.

# Boutique Treasures: Hotels with Soul and Story

# Historic Charm Reimagined

**The Dylan** occupies a special place in my heart. Built in the ashes of a 17th-century theater that was destroyed by fire, this boutique gem feels like staying inside Amsterdam's artistic history. The **award-winning restaurant** is housed in an original 18th-century bakery, where you can enjoy French cuisine while surrounded by exposed brick walls that have witnessed centuries of Amsterdam life.

Each room tells its own story through carefully curated Dutch design elements. The **thick copper-colored curtains** and vintage books create an atmosphere that's both sophisticated and wonderfully cozy – what the Dutch call ""gezellig.""

# The Most Unique Stay in Amsterdam

Nothing prepared me for **SWEETS Bridge Houses** – Amsterdam's most innovative hotel concept. These aren't traditional hotel rooms; they're **converted historic bridge operator houses** scattered across the city's canals. Each tiny house was once home to the bridge operators who manually opened Amsterdam's drawbridges for passing boats.

Staying in a SWEETS house means you're not just visiting Amsterdam; you're living within its infrastructure. I spent three nights in Bridge House 022 on Homomonument canal, where I could watch boats pass by my window while brewing coffee in my own tiny kitchen. The **authentic canal views** are unmatched because you're literally positioned on the water, surrounded by the gentle sounds of lapping waves and passing cyclists.

Each bridge house is designed by **Studio Space&Matter** with modern amenities while preserving historical character. You get a tablet loaded with neighborhood information, Netflix for cozy evenings, and the extraordinary experience of living like a local in one of Amsterdam's most unique accommodations.

# Smart Mid-Range Choices: Quality Meets Value

# Museum Quarter Favorites

**Hotel Aalders** has earned its reputation as a **Museum Quarter favorite** through consistent quality and an unbeatable location. Walking to the Van Gogh Museum takes exactly four minutes (I've timed it), while the Rijksmuseum and Stedelijk Museum are equally accessible. The **complimentary breakfast buffet** features authentic Dutch cheeses and fresh-baked bread that fills the morning air with irresistible aromas.

**Jan Luyken Amsterdam** offers boutique-style comfort at mid-range prices. Their **uniquely styled rooms** feature bold statement pieces and pops of color that reflect Amsterdam's creative spirit. Some rooms offer **direct canal views**, making it feel much more expensive than it actually is.

# City Center Accessibility

**NH Collection Amsterdam** positions you perfectly for exploring both cultural attractions and Amsterdam's famous **Flower Market**. The hotel's modern design contrasts beautifully with the historic city center, and their **efficient tram connections** mean you can reach any neighborhood within 15 minutes.

The **Park Plaza Victoria Amsterdam** provides classic elegance near Central Station. Their **spacious rooms** (a rarity in Amsterdam) and helpful concierge services make it ideal for first-time visitors who want professional guidance for exploring the city.

# Budget-Friendly Gems That Exceed Expectations

Smart budget travelers don't have to sacrifice location or comfort in Amsterdam. **Hotel Espresso** proves this perfectly – despite its budget-friendly pricing, you'll enjoy a **prime city center location** with easy access to major attractions and **efficient public transport** connections.

**Hotel Estheréa** offers family-friendly accommodations without breaking the bank. Their **various room configurations** make them perfect for traveling families, while their central location means attractions, restaurants, and shops are all within walking distance.

What I love about Amsterdam's budget hotels is how they embrace the city's **cozy Dutch atmosphere**. Even the most affordable options often feature charming details like exposed wooden beams, canal views, or traditional Dutch design elements that make your stay feel authentically Amsterdam.

# Choosing Your Perfect Amsterdam Neighborhood

# Canal Ring: Classic Amsterdam Romance

The **UNESCO World Heritage Canal Ring** offers the most iconic Amsterdam experience. Staying here means waking up to **17th-century architecture** and the gentle sounds of canal boats beginning their daily routes. Hotels like The Toren and Pulitzer Amsterdam are positioned perfectly for romantic canal walks and easy access to Amsterdam's finest restaurants.

The morning light on canal water creates an ever-changing display of reflections and shadows that photographers dream about. Evening brings a magical transformation as historic buildings illuminate and canal bridges sparkle with lights.

# Museum Quarter: Culture at Your Doorstep

For art lovers, staying near **Museumplein** is unbeatable. You can visit the Van Gogh Museum before crowds arrive, enjoy morning coffee at **Vondelpark**, and explore world-class galleries without transportation logistics. The Conservatorium Hotel exemplifies this neighborhood's sophisticated cultural atmosphere.

The **Museum Quarter's tree-lined streets** create a quieter, more refined Amsterdam experience while keeping you within walking distance of the canal ring's excitement.

# Jordaan: Authentic Local Living

The **Jordaan neighborhood** offers Amsterdam's most authentic local experience. Former working-class streets now host charming cafés, artisan shops, and locals who've called this area home for generations. Staying here means experiencing Amsterdam as residents do – shopping at **weekly markets**, enjoying neighborhood brown cafés, and discovering hidden courtyards that tour groups never find.

# Sustainable Stays: Amsterdam's Green Hotel Revolution

Amsterdam's commitment to **sustainable tourism** has created exciting opportunities for environmentally conscious travelers. Many hotels now operate with **green energy**, offer **plastic-free accommodations**, and support local communities through sustainable practices.

**Hotel V Nesplein** leads this movement with their comprehensive sustainability program, including **local sourcing**, **waste reduction**, and **carbon-neutral operations**. Staying at these hotels lets you enjoy Amsterdam while supporting the city's efforts to maintain its beauty for future generations.

The trend toward **eco-conscious accommodations** isn't just about environmental responsibility; it's about experiencing Amsterdam more authentically by supporting businesses that care about the city's future.

# Essential Booking Tips for Amsterdam Success

**Timing matters enormously** in Amsterdam. Booking 3-6 months in advance often saves 30-40% compared to last-minute reservations, especially during **tulip season** (April-May) and **summer months** (June-August).

**Consider staying slightly outside the city center** for significant savings. Areas like **Zaandam** offer excellent train connections (6 minutes to central Amsterdam) with hotel rates often 50% lower than city center properties.

\*\*Look for hotels offering **museum passes** or **bike rentals** – these perks can save substantial money while enhancing your Amsterdam experience. Many hotels also provide **local neighborhood guides** created by staff who live in the area.

# Making Your Amsterdam Stay Unforgettable

The perfect Amsterdam hotel isn't just about thread count or marble bathrooms; it's about finding a place that connects you to the city's soul. Whether you choose a luxury canal-side suite, a quirky bridge house, or a cozy budget option, the right accommodation becomes part of your Amsterdam story.

I've learned that Amsterdam reveals its secrets gradually, through morning canal walks, conversations with hotel staff who grew up in the neighborhood, and quiet moments watching bicycle-riding locals navigate cobblestone streets with effortless grace. Your hotel choice determines which secrets you'll discover.

**What kind of Amsterdam experience calls to you?** The romantic canal-side luxury, the authentic local neighborhood living, or perhaps the unique adventure of staying in a converted bridge house?

Whether you're planning your first Manhattan adventure or you're a seasoned New York visitor looking for something fresh, the hotel you choose can absolutely make or break your experience. From century-old institutions where royalty has slept to cutting-edge boutique properties that capture the city's creative spirit, NYC's hotel scene is as diverse as the neighborhoods they call home.

# The Luxury Legends That Define NYC Hospitality

# The Plaza - Where Fairy Tales Come to Life

Walking through The Plaza's revolving doors feels like entering a time machine set to the city's most glamorous era. This **iconic Midtown Manhattan landmark** has been hosting the world's elite since 1907, and honestly, it shows in the most magnificent way possible. The lobby's soaring ceilings, adorned with crystal chandeliers that could illuminate small cities, create an atmosphere that's both grand and surprisingly intimate.

What sets The Plaza apart isn't just its **prime Fifth Avenue location** overlooking Central Park—though that view from the upper floors at sunrise is absolutely breathtaking. It's the attention to detail that makes you feel like royalty. During my last stay, the concierge not only secured impossible-to-get dinner reservations but also arranged for fresh peonies to be delivered to my room because I'd mentioned they were my favorite flowers in passing.

The rooms themselves are a masterclass in elegant luxury. Think rich fabrics, marble bathrooms that rival those found in European palaces, and windows that frame some of the most coveted views in Manhattan. Pro tip: if you're celebrating something special, splurge on a **Central Park view suite**—watching the park transform through the seasons from your window is pure magic.

# The St. Regis - Timeless Elegance in Midtown

If The Plaza is Manhattan's grand dame, then **The St. Regis is its sophisticated sister**. Located at the corner of 55th Street and Fifth Avenue, this Beaux-Arts masterpiece has been redefining luxury hospitality since 1904. What truly distinguishes the St. Regis experience is their legendary **24-hour butler service**—and no, this isn't just some marketing gimmick.

My butler, Marcus, somehow anticipated my needs before I even knew I had them. Fresh coffee appeared exactly when I needed it, my suits were pressed to perfection, and when I mentioned wanting to explore some hidden local gems, he provided a handwritten list of neighborhood secrets that no guidebook could match. The **King Cole Bar**, home of the original Bloody Mary (they call it a ""Red Snapper"" here), remains one of the city's most sophisticated watering holes.

The rooms are spacious by Manhattan standards, featuring rich mahogany furnishings and marble bathrooms with deep soaking tubs that are perfect for unwinding after a day of exploring the city. The location puts you within walking distance of Central Park, Fifth Avenue shopping, and the Theater District.

# The Carlyle - Upper East Side Sophistication

Tucked away on East 76th Street, **The Carlyle represents old-money elegance** at its finest. This Rosewood property has been a discreet haven for celebrities, politicians, and discerning travelers since 1930, and it maintains an air of exclusivity that money simply can't buy elsewhere.

The **Bemelmans Bar**, with its whimsical murals by the creator of the beloved Madeline children's books, serves some of the city's finest cocktails in an atmosphere that feels like a well-kept secret. Live jazz performances here are intimate affairs where you might find yourself sitting next to a Broadway star or a renowned author—the kind of New York experience that feels almost cinematic.

Each room is uniquely decorated with antique furnishings and original artwork, creating spaces that feel more like elegant private residences than hotel rooms. The **Café Carlyle** has hosted legendary performers from Bobby Short to Woody Allen, making it a cultural institution as much as a dining venue.

# Boutique Gems That Capture NYC's Soul

# The Crosby Street Hotel - SoHo's British Charm

Kit Kemp's first New York outpost brought a delightfully fresh perspective to SoHo when it opened in 2009. **The Crosby Street Hotel** stands out with its distinctly British sensibility mixed with Manhattan edge—think English garden prints meeting industrial SoHo architecture.

What I love most about the Crosby is how it captures the neighborhood's artistic spirit. The lobby feels like a sophisticated living room where fashion editors and gallery owners gather for afternoon tea, while the **rooftop terrace** offers stunning views of the downtown skyline. Each room features Kemp's signature bold patterns and custom furnishings, creating spaces that are both comfortable and conversation-worthy.

The location puts you in the heart of SoHo's cobblestone streets, surrounded by world-class galleries, designer boutiques, and some of the city's most innovative restaurants. It's the perfect base for exploring downtown Manhattan's creative energy.

# The High Line Hotel - Chelsea's Hidden Treasure

Housed in a former theological seminary building from 1895, **The High Line Hotel** proves that history and modern luxury can coexist beautifully. This red-brick Gothic Revival gem sits quietly on a tree-lined street in Chelsea, offering a peaceful retreat from the city's constant motion.

The hotel's **cocktail garden** features a converted 1957 double-decker London bus that serves as both bar and conversation piece. It's these quirky touches, combined with vintage rotary phones in each room and complimentary Shinola bikes for exploring the neighborhood, that make this property feel special.

The location is ideal for accessing the **High Line elevated park**, Chelsea Market, and the Meatpacking District's buzzing nightlife scene. Rooms maintain their historical character with exposed brick and original architectural details while offering modern amenities.

# 1 Hotels Central Park - Eco-Luxury Meets Nature

For travelers who want luxury without compromising their environmental values, **1 Hotels Central Park** offers an innovative approach to hospitality. This LEED-certified property uses reclaimed materials throughout, from the living moss wall in the lobby to the reclaimed wood furnishings in each room.

The **rooftop bar and restaurant** provides some of the most spectacular views of Central Park you'll find anywhere in the city. During my summer stay, I spent countless hours on the terrace watching sunset paint the park in golden hues while sipping craft cocktails made with ingredients from the hotel's own garden.

What impressed me most was how the hotel's commitment to sustainability enhanced rather than hindered the luxury experience. The in-room air purification systems, organic bath products, and locally-sourced dining options all contributed to a sense of wellness that's rare in Manhattan hotels.

# Modern Marvels and Rooftop Dreams

# Virgin Hotels New York - Broadway's Bold Statement

**Voted #1 Hotel in New York by Travel + Leisure in 2024**, Virgin Hotels New York brings Richard Branson's irreverent style to the heart of the Theater District. This property perfectly balances playful design with sophisticated amenities, creating an atmosphere that's both fun and refined.

The **rooftop pool and bar** offers stunning 360-degree views of the Manhattan skyline, while the ground-floor restaurant serves innovative cuisine in a space that buzzes with creative energy. What sets Virgin apart is their commitment to making luxury accessible—every detail from the mobile check-in to the in-room entertainment systems is designed with the modern traveler in mind.

# The William Vale - Brooklyn's Crown Jewel

While technically across the East River in Williamsburg, **The William Vale** offers some of the most dramatic Manhattan skyline views you'll find anywhere. This sleek, modern property represents Brooklyn's evolution into a luxury destination in its own right.

The hotel's **rooftop pool** provides an entirely different perspective of the city, while the ground-floor restaurant has become a destination for food lovers from both sides of the river. The rooms are spacious and modern, with floor-to-ceiling windows that showcase the Manhattan skyline in all its glory.

# Neighborhood Champions

# Midtown West - Theater District Convenience

For theater lovers, staying in **Midtown West** puts you within walking distance of Broadway's biggest shows. The **Chatwal Hotel** offers Art Deco glamour just steps from Times Square, while properties like the **Knickerbocker** provide modern luxury with Instagram-worthy rooftop bars.

The neighborhood can be crowded, especially around Times Square, but the convenience of being able to walk to shows, restaurants, and major attractions makes it worthwhile for many visitors.

# Lower Manhattan - Financial District Finds

Downtown Manhattan offers a different kind of New York experience, with historic cobblestone streets and stunning harbor views. **The Greenwich Hotel** in Tribeca (co-owned by Robert De Niro) provides ultimate luxury and privacy, while newer properties like **Casa Cipriani** bring Italian sophistication to the waterfront.

This area is perfect for visitors who want to explore neighborhoods like SoHo, Tribeca, and the West Village while still having easy access to major attractions via subway.

# Insider Tips for Choosing Your Perfect NYC Stay

**Location is everything** in New York City. Each neighborhood has its own distinct personality, and your choice should align with your priorities. If you're here for Broadway shows and major tourist attractions, Midtown makes sense. For shopping and museum visits, the Upper East Side near Central Park is ideal. Art lovers and foodies should consider downtown neighborhoods like SoHo or the Village.

**Book directly with hotels** when possible—you'll often receive room upgrades, late checkout, and other perks that third-party booking sites can't offer. Many luxury properties offer special packages that include dining credits, spa treatments, or tickets to local attractions.

**Consider the season** when choosing your hotel. Summer rooftop access becomes crucial, while winter might make indoor pools and spa facilities more appealing. Spring and fall offer the best weather for exploring on foot, making location even more important.

**Don't overlook service levels**. The difference between a good hotel and a great one often comes down to staff who remember your preferences and anticipate your needs. Properties like The St. Regis and The Carlyle have built their reputations on exceptional service that creates truly memorable experiences.

# Your NYC Hotel Adventure Awaits

Choosing the perfect hotel in New York City is about more than just finding a clean room and comfortable bed—it's about finding your gateway into the Manhattan experience. Whether you're drawn to the timeless elegance of The Plaza, the artistic flair of boutique properties like The Crosby Street Hotel, or the modern luxury of Virgin Hotels New York, each property offers its own unique lens through which to explore this incredible city.

The hotels I've shared represent the very best of what NYC has to offer, from century-old institutions that have hosted royalty to cutting-edge properties that are redefining modern hospitality. Each provides not just accommodation, but a doorway into different aspects of the city's character.

What makes a hotel truly memorable isn't just its thread count or marble bathrooms—it's those moments when you feel like you've discovered something special, whether that's a hidden rooftop bar with stunning skyline views or a concierge who helps you uncover neighborhood secrets that most visitors never find.

1l8ysk5,https://www.reddit.com/r/TicketToEverywhere/comments/1l8ysk5/best_hotels_in_new_orleans/,Best Hotels in New Orleans,"The moment I stepped off the plane at Louis Armstrong International Airport, New Orleans wrapped around me like a warm, humid embrace. The air was thick with possibility—and the faint scent of café au lait drifting from somewhere beyond the terminal. But it wasn't until I caught my first glimpse of those iconic wrought-iron balconies adorning my hotel that I truly understood: choosing the right place to stay in the Big Easy isn't just about finding a bed for the night. It's about selecting the perfect lens through which to experience this magical, musical, completely intoxicating city.

After eight visits to New Orleans and nights spent in everything from grand luxury suites overlooking the Mississippi to charming boutique hideaways tucked behind garden courtyards, I've learned that **the best hotels in New Orleans** don't just provide accommodation—they become part of your story. Whether you're drawn to the jazz-soaked corridors of a historic French Quarter mansion or the modern elegance of a riverfront tower, your hotel choice will shape every moment of your NOLA adventure.

Let me walk you through the hotels that have captured my heart (and occasionally stolen my sleep with their irresistible charm).

# Why Location Matters: The Magic of the French Quarter

On my second trip to New Orleans, I made the mistake of booking a hotel outside the **French Quarter** to save money. Big mistake. While the property was lovely, I found myself constantly calculating Uber rides and missing the spontaneous magic that happens when you can simply step outside your hotel door and into the rhythm of the city.

The **French Quarter**—or Vieux Carré as locals lovingly call it—isn't just a neighborhood; it's the beating heart of New Orleans. When you stay here, morning coffee comes with the soundtrack of street musicians tuning their instruments in Jackson Square. Evening cocktails are accompanied by the distant brass of a second line parade winding through the narrow streets. And late-night adventures? Well, they're just a stumble away from your hotel lobby.

But here's the insider secret I've learned: even within the French Quarter, location nuances matter. Hotels on quieter streets like Dauphine or Chartres offer peaceful courtyards where you can escape the Bourbon Street chaos, while properties directly on Royal Street put you steps from the city's finest antique shops and art galleries. The key is finding that sweet spot where you can dive into the action when you want it, and retreat to tranquil Southern elegance when you need to recharge.

# Luxury Hotels: Where Elegance Meets Southern Charm

# Four Seasons Hotel New Orleans

Rising 34 stories above Canal Street, the **Four Seasons** redefined luxury hospitality in New Orleans when it opened. I'll never forget my first stay here—stepping into my river-view room and watching the mighty Mississippi roll by while sipping a Sazerac from my private balcony. The hotel's modern elegance beautifully complements the historic city below, and their **Chandelier Bar** serves cocktails so expertly crafted they're practically works of art.

What sets this property apart is how it marries contemporary sophistication with authentic New Orleans touches. The rooftop pool offers a stunning escape from the summer heat, while the two signature restaurants showcase the city's incredible culinary heritage with a refined twist.

# The Windsor Court

Walking into **The Windsor Court** feels like stepping into a British manor house that somehow found its way to the American South. This AAA Five Diamond property has been setting the gold standard for luxury in New Orleans since 1984, and every detail reflects that commitment to excellence.

During my anniversary stay, the staff surprised us with champagne and hand-written notes welcoming us back. It's these personal touches—combined with museum-quality art adorning the hallways and one of the city's most celebrated afternoon tea services—that make The Windsor Court feel less like a hotel and more like a gracious private residence.

# The Roosevelt New Orleans, A Waldorf Astoria Hotel

The **Roosevelt Hotel** has been hosting dignitaries, celebrities, and discerning travelers since the 1890s, and stepping into its opulent lobby still takes my breath away. Those gleaming brass elevators, the mosaic floors that tell stories of old New Orleans, and the crystal chandeliers that have witnessed decades of celebration—this is where history lives and breathes.

The recently renovated rooms blend period elegance with modern comforts, but it's the hotel's legendary **Sazerac Bar** that truly steals the show. Sitting at that mahogany bar, watching expert bartenders craft cocktails with the precision of seasoned musicians, you can almost hear the whispers of all the fascinating conversations that have unfolded in this very spot.

# Hotel Monteleone

There's something deeply special about **Hotel Monteleone**—perhaps because it's been family-owned since 1886, or maybe it's the way the staff treats every guest like a welcomed relative. The **Carousel Bar**, the hotel's famous rotating cocktail lounge, has become my traditional first stop on every New Orleans visit. Sipping a Pimm's Cup while slowly spinning above the French Quarter streets never gets old.

The hotel's rooftop pool offers spectacular views of the Quarter's red-tiled roofs and church spires, while the literary heritage (Tennessee Williams once called it home) adds an extra layer of cultural richness to every stay.

# Boutique Gems: Character and Soul

# Maison de la Luz

Crowned as Travel + Leisure readers' **#1 hotel in New Orleans** in 2024, **Maison de la Luz** occupies a beautifully converted 1908 City Hall annex. This 67-room gem proves that sometimes the most memorable hotels are those that embrace their unique architectural bones rather than fighting them.

What captured my heart here wasn't just the stunning Art Deco details or the thoughtfully curated local art—it was the evening wine and cheese reception that transforms the lobby into an intimate gathering space. Guests naturally migrate toward each other, sharing travel stories and restaurant recommendations over carefully selected Louisiana wines. It's the kind of organic hospitality that can't be manufactured.

# Hotel Peter & Paul

Converting a 19th-century Catholic church, schoolhouse, and rectory into a boutique hotel could have gone very wrong. Instead, **Hotel Peter & Paul** in the Marigny neighborhood became something extraordinary. Each of the 71 rooms tells a different story, with four-poster beds topped with small crosses nodding to the property's religious heritage while rich fabrics and country-style furnishings create an unexpectedly harmonious blend.

The church bar, set within the original sanctuary, serves as both a stunning architectural showpiece and a gathering place that honors the building's spiritual past. It's the kind of place that makes you slow down, appreciate craftsmanship, and feel connected to the layers of history beneath your feet.

# The Chloe

This transformed Victorian mansion in the Garden District embodies everything I love about New Orleans' ability to preserve the past while embracing the present. **The Chloe** feels like staying in a wealthy relative's perfectly appointed home—if that relative happened to have impeccable taste and a gift for entertaining.

The wraparound porches provide the perfect perch for afternoon cocktails, while the hotel's restaurant consistently ranks among the city's finest. During my last visit, I spent an entire morning on the veranda with coffee and beignets, watching the streetcar glide past century-old oak trees. Pure New Orleans magic.

# Hotel Mazarin

Tucked between Bourbon and Royal streets, **Hotel Mazarin** offers boutique charm without sacrificing location. The crystal chandeliers and marble details in each room create an intimate luxury that feels authentically New Orleans, while **Patrick's Bar Vin** downstairs has become my go-to spot for a pre-dinner glass of wine and expert local recommendations.

What I love most about this property is how it strikes the perfect balance—close enough to hear the jazz spilling out of Bourbon Street clubs, but quiet enough that you can actually sleep when you're ready to call it a night.

# Historic Properties: Stories in Every Room

# Royal Sonesta New Orleans

There's nothing quite like experiencing Mardi Gras from a **Royal Sonesta** balcony overlooking Bourbon Street. This luxury hotel has been hosting revelers and refined travelers since 1969, and every room tells stories of the countless celebrations, intimate conversations, and magical moments that have unfolded within these walls.

The heated courtyard pool provides a welcome respite from the French Quarter's energetic pace, while the hotel's **Jazz Playhouse** (voted #1 Jazz Club in New Orleans) ensures that live music remains central to the experience. During my last stay, I found myself lingering in the lobby each evening, drawn by the impromptu performances that seemed to emerge naturally from the hotel's musical soul.

# Soniat House

Spread across two colonial townhouses dating back to the 1830s, **Soniat House** offers an intimate glimpse into New Orleans' elegant past. The antique-filled rooms, each uniquely decorated with period furnishings, make you feel like a privileged guest in a private French Quarter residence.

The hidden courtyard, draped with jasmine and shaded by ancient magnolia trees, provides the perfect setting for morning coffee or evening cocktails. It's the kind of place where you instinctively speak in hushed tones, not because you have to, but because the atmosphere itself commands respect for the history you're inhabiting.

# Dauphine Orleans Hotel

The **Dauphine Orleans** embraces its colorful past with a wink and a smile. Built on the site of a former bordello, the hotel playfully acknowledges its risqué heritage while providing comfortable, uniquely decorated accommodations just steps from Bourbon Street.

**May Baily's Place**, the hotel's bar named after the infamous madam who once operated here, serves as both a conversation starter and a charming gathering spot. The saltwater pool, hidden away in the central courtyard, offers a peaceful escape where you can almost imagine the fascinating characters who once walked these same grounds.

# Budget-Friendly Options with Local Flavor

Finding affordable accommodations in New Orleans doesn't mean sacrificing character or location. Some of my most memorable stays have been at these charming properties that prove luxury isn't always about thread counts and marble bathrooms—sometimes it's about authentic hospitality and local soul.

**Hotel St. Marie**, part of the respected Valentino Hotels collection, offers genuine French Quarter charm at prices that won't break the bank. The exposed brick walls, wrought-iron details, and peaceful courtyard create an atmosphere that feels quintessentially New Orleans. Plus, guests can access pools at other Valentino properties throughout the Quarter—a perk that adds significant value to your stay.

**French Market Inn** puts you within walking distance of the famous **Café du Monde** and the bustling French Market, while maintaining the intimate scale of a boutique property. The 19th-century building's architectural details have been lovingly preserved, and the staff consistently goes above and beyond to ensure guests feel welcomed and informed about local attractions.

**Place d'Armes Hotel** proves that budget-friendly doesn't mean basic. The historic property surrounds a lush courtyard where you can escape the Quarter's energy while remaining steps from all the action. Many rooms feature exposed brick walls and traditional New Orleans architectural details that provide authentic character without the luxury price tag.

# Insider Tips for Booking Like a Local

After years of visiting New Orleans, I've learned that timing can dramatically impact both availability and pricing. **Hotel rates fluctuate wildly** based on the city's packed event calendar—Mardi Gras, Jazz Fest, and major football games can triple normal rates overnight. My advice? Book early for major events, but consider visiting during shoulder seasons like late fall or early spring when you'll find better deals and smaller crowds.

Here's a local secret: many French Quarter hotels offer **package deals** that include perks like breakfast, parking, or cocktail credits. These packages often provide better value than booking rooms alone, especially at properties like Hotel Monteleone or The Roosevelt, where parking can cost $40+ per night.

For the best rates at boutique properties, book directly through the hotel's website rather than third-party booking sites. Many hotels offer **rate matching** guarantees and throw in additional perks like room upgrades or late checkout for direct bookings. Plus, when you book directly, you're more likely to receive personalized service and insider recommendations from staff who appreciate your business.

**Tuesday through Thursday stays** typically offer the best rates, while weekends command premium pricing, especially during festival seasons. If your schedule allows flexibility, arriving on a weekday can save you significant money that's better spent on the city's incredible restaurants and live music venues.

# Your New Orleans Story Awaits

Choosing where to stay in New Orleans isn't just about amenities or location—it's about selecting the backdrop for your own Big Easy adventure. Whether you're drawn to the grandeur of a historic luxury hotel, the intimate charm of a boutique property, or the authentic character of a budget-friendly inn, the right choice will enhance every moment of your visit.

The beauty of New Orleans lies in its ability to surprise and delight at every turn. Your hotel becomes your sanctuary between jazz-filled nights and beignet-sweetened mornings, your launching point for culinary adventures and cultural discoveries. Choose wisely, embrace the city's legendary hospitality, and prepare to fall in love with a place that will call you back again and again.

I've been seeing this guy for a while, and we were just in that weird phase where you haven't yet labeled anything.

His face was priceless at first, kinda like a deer caught in headlights, but in a cute way.

He fumbled a bit and then said, ""Well, I was hoping we could be, like, us?"" It was adorable and awkward all at once. I didn't exactly know how to respond, so I sorta laughed, and said, ""Us sounds good. Is 'us' exclusive?"" We both ended up laughing, and finally, he nodded, making it official. 🥰

(Also known on the tattered list as “The Night the Store Looked Back”)

I got in early again. It wasn’t even nerves this time. It was… habit. Something in me didn’t feel right unless I saw the coffee brew and the lights flicker at least once before the midnight chime.

It didn’t help that the black phone had gone silent after last shift.

Not even a dial tone now.

Just cold plastic and a soft hum that felt more like waiting than malfunction.


---

11:46 PM — She’s Here

She didn’t open the door. She was just there.
A little girl with braided pigtails and scuffed sneakers, standing in front of register one, staring at the candy rack.

No parent. No door chime.

Her eyes didn’t move, but her head did—a slow tilt to the side like she was listening for something.

I knew better than to ask her name. Rule Five was very clear.

> ""If a little girl shows up at any time during your shift alone, give her the candy she wants. Don’t charge her. Use the petty cash. Don’t speak to her unless she speaks first.""



She reached out, picked up a pack of sour worms. Looked at me.

> “These are the ones he liked,” she said.



> “He?” I asked before I could stop myself.



Her smile faded. Not angry—just disappointed.

She placed the candy on the counter and slowly walked toward the Vault.

Not the ice door. The main door.

I didn’t stop her.

Didn’t dare.


---

12:09 AM — She Never Left

I waited five minutes. Then ten. I restocked quietly. Faced every bottle. Kept breathing like that would help.

But when I checked the Vault? She wasn’t there.

Neither door had opened. I hadn’t blinked. She just… wasn’t there anymore.

There was, however, a cold six-pack of unlabeled water bottles. And in the middle of them?

The brass key from Night Four.

Only now it had a tag on it.

Not paper. Fabric. Like something sewn into a uniform.

It read:

> “101. Ice Locker.”




---

12:44 AM — Wrong Reflection

I went to the ice locker display door, opened it, and pulled the door halfway. Not all the way. Just enough to peek inside.

It looked normal.

But my reflection in the glass?

It wasn’t mine.

Same clothes. Same stance.
But the other me had no eyes.

Just dark, smooth sockets and a soft grin, like it was enjoying watching me watch it.

I closed the door. The cold followed me for a few seconds too long.


---

1:22 AM — The Key Turns

Back in the Vault, I checked the freezer door.

At the bottom, barely visible in the frost, was a small, rusted lock.
I’d never seen it before.

I used the key.

It clicked once, deep and heavy, like turning a switch in a forgotten part of the building.

The freezer lights dimmed. The hum of the ice machines grew sharper, almost like whispering.

The door wouldn’t open any farther. Just an inch of fog.

Inside, I saw what looked like an old 7-Eleven name badge.
But not one from this location.

The name?

“M. Tiller”

No one by that name works here. Not now. Not ever.


---

2:03 AM — The Mirror Man

The front cooler lights flickered.

I went to check them—just another excuse to walk anywhere except near the Vault.

That’s when I saw him.

A man in a black suit, standing in aisle five.
Not facing the shelves. Not browsing.

Just staring into the convex mirror mounted on the corner.

His face was perfectly visible.

Too visible.

His features never moved, not even to blink. The lighting didn’t cast shadows on his face. Like he wasn’t quite in the store the same way I was.

I remembered Rule One again. Even though this didn’t match exactly, I wasn’t going to risk it.

> “If at 1:34 AM, a man in a black suit shows up, but you can’t make out his face — even if it’s unobstructed — go into the back room and don’t come out until you hear the door chime again.”



This wasn’t 1:34. This wasn’t exact.
But I went into the back anyway.

Better safe than ripped from reality.


---

2:09 AM — The Code Phrase

The black phone rang.

A burst of static. Then:

> “Code: Breakfast Bite. Potato Split Top Bun.”



I froze.

It was the first time the code phrase was ever used without me calling in first.

Which means something else had triggered it.

The voice was calm. Firm.

> “He’s not gone yet. Do not look into mirrors. Do not leave through the ice door. When the Vault resets, the girl will return. Do not acknowledge her unless she finishes her sentence.”



Click.

No more dial tone.


---

3:03 AM — She Finished the Sentence

I went back out. Every mirror was covered now.

Brown paper. No tape.

Just perfectly flat and still.

And there she was, sitting cross-legged on the floor in front of the Vault, eating the sour worms.

She looked up.

> “These are the ones he liked,” she repeated. “Before he… forgot what a face was.”



I nodded. Didn’t speak.

She smiled again, stood up, and vanished behind the chip display.

This time, I didn’t follow.


---

3:59 AM — One Final Change

Before the shift ended, I checked under the register.

The petty cash box was slightly open.

Inside, next to the receipts and cash?

A second, folded list of rules.

Tattered. Yellowed.

One rule was visible at the top:

> “Rule Zero: If you find this list, it’s already too late for someone else.”



I didn’t open it yet.

I just started with clear aligners (3M | Clarity) and am on weekly changes. I’ve heard some people drink things with a straw frequently and just rinse with water afterwards. 

That seems too risky to me, but was wondering if on the day of a tray change if I:

1. Get a sugary frozen coffee
2. Drink with a straw
3. Swish/Rinse Mouth with water frequently (or would just at the end be better?
4. Remove the old tray to eat once I’ve drank maybe half of the coffee
5. Brush/floss as normal
6. Put new trays in

Does this sound safe?? (Cavity prevention wise) I drink slowly which is why just drinking it when they’re out isn’t the best option for me. I would definitely try to speed it up for this, but feels a little pointless to get myself a sweet treat if I’m just guzzling it down instead of actually enjoying it lol

Routine I’m trying to get into:
Eating two meals a day, late breakfast and dinner whenever works. Both larger than normal meals to make up for no lunch. Right now:

1. Get food and beverages mostly ready
2. Remove aligners and start timer
3. Eat - takes about 20 mins usually
4. Wait a little bit to try and limit enamel damage. Try to wait until 25 mins on timer before starting dental routine
5. Wash hands, clean aligners with dish soap and water
6. Floss
7. Brush teeth
8. Wash hands again, rinse and double check aligners, put back in. Timer has been at about 30-40 mins at this step usually 
9. Drink water throughout the day (should I refrain from swishing it in my mouth?). Trying to make sure to wash my big water bottle more often since starting

Thanks so much for any input!! I’m 29F and had some bad dental issues a few years ago partially due to depression (in full remission) and possibly an autoimmune disorder (undiagnosed, seeing a rheumatologist). So I’m just trying to make sure I give myself the best chance of success. But also I “need” some sort of treat to look forward to to keep myself going with this treatment lol. So the frozen coffee once a week is my idea for that 🙏 ",1,1749663121.0,orthodontics,0,1.0,False

Is it Possible To Manifest SP against ANY CIRCUMSTANCES ?? 3P situation..No Contact for Years. Living in Different Countries.. SP told You they don't love you or whatever. 

My answer is YES. 
IT'S 💯 POSSIBLE TO MANIFEST SP Mo matter what You are facing or seeing in your reality. 

I myself Manifested my SP against all circumstances. Against all odds. Not even single situation or circumstance was in my favour. Still I Manifested my SP. 

Question is How I did it ?

It's simple to answer but quite difficult to understand n implement.

Soo here is my story and Guidance to get Your SP. 

Here is the Complete Story. ( Going to be lengthy but it ll help you to understand the complete journey ) 

I had a breakup with my ex-girlfriend in 2019.
I was shattered, but then I decided that I would attract a girl who was more beautiful and more loving than my ex.
I was very specific about the kind of partner I wanted.
I wrote down every detail I desired in my future partner — her looks, aesthetics, behavior, nature, skin color, name, height, physique — everything.

Then I performed an imaginal act, as if I had already found my ideal partner. After that, I let it go; I didn’t obsess over it.
I did this exercise just for fun in March 2019. I still remember it clearly.

A few weeks later, I saw a girl from a distance, and I felt like she was the one.
Then I prayed to God, saying, “Please, I want to know her. Do something — I just want to meet her once.”

I forgot about her and the prayers I had made in that moment.
A few weeks later, I received a follow request on Instagram from a girl. When I checked her profile, I realized she was the exact same girl I had seen a few weeks ago.

She even messaged me, saying, “Do we really know each other?”
I was like, Damn!
Then we started talking. Slowly, I began to realize that she was the exact same girl I had imagined during that fun exercise — the same aesthetics, the same height, the same traits. It felt like I had crafted her out of a raw mold.

But as we continued talking, it became clear that it was a one-way conversation. She wasn’t responding the way I had hoped — her replies were cold and distant.
Eventually, I found out that she had been in a relationship with a guy for the past 5–6 years.

Then I had a desire to meet her.
We met twice, just for an hour each time, over coffee. The conversations were normal and casual.

But for me, it was a win — almost like a miracle. I had wanted to meet her, and I did. That experience gave me a boost and confidence that there’s something magical about these higher forces.

The very next day, she moved to a different city.
After that, she got busy with her life, and we barely spoke over text.

That’s when I started exploring the Law of Attraction.
(I didn’t know about the Law of Assumption or Neville Goddard’s teachings on manifestation back in 2019.)
The only thing I knew was: “Imagine that person with you in the present moment. Feel it as real, and feel good — just for the sake of the experience.” 

That was the only thing I knew about the Law of Attraction.
(I wasn’t aware of third-party situations, no-contact phases, self-concept, affirmations, or the SAT technique.)

The only thing I knew was: “Imagine that person with you now, and feel as if it’s real.”

So, whenever I had a desire to talk to her or be with her, I would imagine having a loving conversation with her.
If I was sitting at a coffee shop and missing her, I would simply imagine her sitting next to me, holding my hand and loving me.
If I was having dinner, I’d imagine she was the one who cooked it and was feeding me with love.
If I was working out at the gym, I would imagine her helping me with the workout, taking gym pictures with me, as if we were doing it all together.

So basically, I just wanted to feel good as if she was with me now. I focused on my imagination and treated it as if it were real.

I was internally living in my imagination — as if we were already dating and in a loving relationship.

Now, the most important part: how did I ignore the third-party situation, the no-contact phase, and the fact that she was in a different city?

To be honest, it never really bothered me — because my ultimate goal was to feel good in the present moment. I chose to ignore everything else, as if it didn’t matter.

Third-party situation? I knew that couples break up eventually — it’s a very normal thing. I had gone through a breakup myself after a 4–5 year relationship, so I understood how common it is.
I didn’t focus on her boyfriend at all. I simply enjoyed the imagined scenes where she was my girlfriend, and I was her boyfriend — the best thing that ever happened to her. And she loved me deeply.

Period.

I did this exercise for a few months — until around September or October 2019.
After that, she moved to her hometown with her boyfriend (a live-in relationship situation).
Then the pandemic happened.

To be honest, I lost hope. I was tired of doing the imagination scenes — my mind felt saturated with the idea that I already had my girlfriend. So I reached a point where I didn’t feel like doing any more imagination techniques. I was done.
(Neville Goddard calls this the Sabbath state — the state of wish fulfilled.)

I got busy with my own life. I deleted all my social media. I even deleted her contact.
Why? Because I had lost all hope and wasn’t expecting anything to happen.
I wasn’t expecting any outcome at all, simply because I didn’t know if these things actually worked or manifested in real life.

All I had wanted was to feel good — and I did.
Then, I let everything go.

After some time, I completely forgot about her. She was living her life, and I was living mine.

One and a half years later —

It was October 2021.
Out of nowhere, I received a call from an unknown number.
Guess what? It was the same girl.

She said, “I’ve moved back to your city — let’s meet.”

I was like, Holy f**... she still has my number?*
She literally called me after a year and a half?

At first, I thought maybe she had just moved back for work or something.
Then we started meeting more often.
And after some time, she proposed to me — and we started dating.

During this time, everything began to unfold exactly as I had imagined back in 2019.
The moment she pulled me in and kissed me, I realized — I had imagined this exact scene before.
Her waking up next to me... holding hands... walking down the street on a cold winter night, cuddling under a blanket... cooking dinner for me... washing my clothes...

I was like, Wait a second. Is this really happening?
It felt surreal — as if I had already lived this in my imagination, and now I was experiencing it in physical reality.

Not gonna lie — every single thing I had once imagined was replicated exactly as it was.

That’s when I truly started believing in the Law of Attraction.
I began studying it more deeply, and eventually, I came across the Law of Assumption.

Then I realized — I had actually been practicing the Law of Assumption all along.
Telling myself: “She is my girlfriend. We are in a relationship. We are living together.”

Imagination was just the technique — the tool I used to assume my desired reality.

We all wonder what’s happening behind the scenes, especially when we don’t see any movement in the physical reality.
Instead, we often see the opposite of what we desire.

We see our SP (specific person) with a 3P (third party).
We see them going on trips, romantic dates, and sharing happy moments.
Right?

And then we start questioning:
""How is it even possible to manifest? I’m seeing no movement. I can literally see my SP with someone else. They look happy. My SP is in a different city. We haven’t spoken in months.""

All those negative thoughts start creeping in.

So, I started digging deeper.
Out of curiosity, I began asking her questions — I wanted to understand what actually happened during those two years we were apart — behind the scenes.

I asked,
“How was your relationship during those two years of the pandemic, when you were living together?”
(Why did I ask that? Because I had assumed they must have been happy together — enjoying a romantic, loving time.)

But her response shocked me.

She said,
“We were just living under the same roof. My boyfriend was always occupied with work. He hardly had time for me. I was depressed. We used to fight almost every day. We only went out a few times just to feel better, but we were constantly arguing. And honestly, we had zero physical intimacy during those two years. I was just eating, feeling low, watching YouTube and Netflix, and sleeping.”

Then I asked her,
“Did you ever think about me during that time?”

She replied,
“Yes, I used to think that whenever I visited my hometown, I’d want to meet you again.”

I asked her,
“Why did you move to Pune?”

She said,
“Actually, I had been planning to move to Mumbai for two years for my career — not Pune. But suddenly, at the last moment, I changed my mind and decided to move to Pune instead.”

Then she told me that when she moved to Pune, she contacted almost everyone — except me.
She confessed that she had bad experiences with the guys she met after moving to Pune.
These were guys who had been in constant contact with her for the past two years — texting and calling her every day.
On the other hand, I was in a complete no-contact situation.

Then, one night around 4 AM, she suddenly called me and asked to meet as soon as possible.
We met around 7 AM that same morning.

I was thinking, Why is she calling me out of nowhere after two years — and at such an odd time?

After that, we started meeting more often and spending time together.
She began to enjoy my company, grew fond of me, and eventually, she ended up proposing to me.

So, what’s the learning from this experience?

I’ve completed my journey — from zero contact to being in a relationship.

The biggest lesson: Movement is always happening behind the scenes — even if we can’t see it.
We often try to look for signs of movement by checking Instagram stories, social media accounts, following lists, their status with the third party, their pictures together, etc.
We see these things and instantly give them negative meaning:
""Oh, this isn’t working.""
""They look so happy together.""
""There’s no movement.""

But remember — what we see isn’t always the truth.
We never know what’s really happening behind the scenes.

When I looked back and connected all the dots, I realized — everything was actually unfolding in my favor.
Every situation that seemed like a setback was secretly working for me.

The pandemic happened.
She moved back to her hometown and started living with her boyfriend — at first glance, that seemed like an unfavorable situation.
But in reality, it was working in my favor.

She even told me that during the time she lived with her boyfriend, she realized she couldn’t see a future with him — she couldn't marry him.

Other guys were constantly in contact with her for two years, some even proposed to her — but she rejected them all.
And eventually, she ended up proposing to me.

It was all a series of events — silently aligning in my favor.

How did she change her mind and move to my city when she originally wanted to move to a different one?

Because it was my imagination.
I had imagined us being together.
I didn’t ask her to come to my city.
She made that decision on her own — or at least, it appeared that way.
I didn’t influence her directly.
I simply imagined us being together, and somehow, she changed her mind — as if it were her own choice.

It’s that simple.
You don’t have to convince or influence another person to change their mind.
You don’t even have to lift a finger.
The Universe has infinite ways to fulfill your desire.

I wasn’t questioning how it would happen —
She already had a boyfriend…
She had already moved to a different city…
We weren’t even in touch regularly — no texting, no calling.

But none of that mattered.
The only thing that mattered was what I imagined, and what I assumed to be true.
The rest wasn’t my job — it was the Universe’s job to make it happen.

How and why did she break up with her boyfriend after 5–6 years of being in a relationship?

I never asked her to leave her boyfriend.
I never forced her or influenced her decision in any way.
All I did was imagine the two of us being in a loving relationship together.

Eventually, it was her boyfriend’s own behavior that led to the breakup.
I didn’t ask him to act a certain way or to fight with her — it all happened naturally.

After spending two years living together under the same roof, she decided to leave him — after a 5–6 year-long relationship.

I didn’t do anything externally.
I simply imagined that she and I were together in a relationship.

The rest? A series of events unfolded on their own.
Everything happened behind the scenes —
Things you can’t see on social media, TikTok, or WhatsApp statuses.


Now, let’s talk about something that almost everyone in the manifestation community asks:

""How many times should I do affirmations?""
""How many times should I repeat the visualization scene?""
""Should I do the 369 or 555 technique?""

Here’s my honest experience:

I never did any affirmation routine.
I never repeated my imagination or visualization scene more than once.
I never did the 369 or 555 technique.

I was doing it purely as a fun activity.
Like — I’m in the bathroom, and I’d imagine my girlfriend banging on the door just to irritate me.
I’m taking a shower, and I imagine her wanting to join me — just for fun.
I’m washing clothes or cleaning my room, and I imagine her saying, “Stop! I’ll do it for you.”

That’s the key: Make manifestation a fun experience, not a burden.
You’re supposed to feel good after imagining — not anxious.

The Most Popular Question in the Manifestation Community:

""When will it happen?""

The honest answer: NO ONE KNOWS.
And if you really want your manifestation to happen fast, stop focusing on time.

If you just imagined your SP right now — why are you trying to experience it again?
If I’m already in a relationship with my girlfriend in imagination, I don’t sit around wondering when it will happen — because I already feel like it’s real.

And when you live from that assumption, things manifest in the quickest way possible.

It requires patience.
If you keep checking your outer reality for signs, you’re actually delaying your manifestation.


---

My Tips (From Personal Experience):

Everything is possible.

Circumstances don’t matter — no matter how bad things seem.

Your SP loves you and wants you just as much as you want them.

3P (third party) is irrelevant. Ignore them.

Nothing is permanent. Everything is changeable as per your desire.

Your only job is to decide exactly what you want — and stick to it. Ignore everything else.

The “how” and “when” are not your job — that’s the Universe’s job.

Don’t get obsessed with techniques or what coaches say. It’s not necessary to affirm every day or visualize every night.
Do it because it’s fun, not because you’re desperate.

You are more important than your SP.

What Does It Feel Like to Finally Get Your SP?

My experience?

At first, I thought my SP was out of my league.
She’s a professional model, very beautiful.
I thought it would be a miracle just to meet her.
I believed it would be magical if she ever kissed me.
I felt I would be lucky if I ever got to date her.

That was my mindset during the manifestation phase.

But when we actually started dating?

She turned out to be just a normal person like me.
She literally said, “I’m lucky to have you.”
She kisses me almost every passing hour — my lips actually hurt now.
I get irritated sometimes because she’s so physically and emotionally obsessed with me.
She calls me every hour, texts me like crazy — and I purposely ignore her texts and calls sometimes just to take a break.

Point is — you just feel normal once it happens.
Your SP is just another human being like you.

So stop obsessing.
Stop thinking, “Oh no! My SP blocked me, my life is over.”
That’s all noise. Let it go.

Manifesting your SP is the easiest thing on the planet.

Just assume you already have your SP. Smile.
The rest will be taken care of.

I hope this helps you.
If you still need anything — feel free to DM me.

""Catherine, sit down. We need to talk,"" my father said, looking quite agitated.

""What's going on, Dad?"" I asked tiredly. I had worked all day, gone to college at night, and upon getting home, all I wanted was to take a shower and crash into bed. But that wasn't possible.

""Catherine, your cousin's wedding invitation has arrived,"" my mother said.

""That little tramp is not my cousin!"" I snapped, already getting angry.

""Catherine, she is your cousin,"" my mother insisted. ""You need to stop this childish behavior. Melissa already hit her and caused a scene here at home. Enough! She's my sister's daughter, which makes her your cousin.""

""I'm sorry, Mom, but she means nothing to me,"" I tried to stay calm. ""She slept with my boyfriend in my bed. That's not something she should do.""

I had been dating Claude for four years; he was my first boyfriend, and I found him in my bed, in my room, sleeping with Kelly, my cousin! I was in shock. Of course, Melissa, my best friend, went after them. Since then, things had been tensed at home because my parents insisted it was silly and that I should act as if nothing had happened and go back to being around my cousin.

""He was wrong, Catherine, since he was your boyfriend,"" my mother argued. ""Kelly, poor thing, was seduced. He dishonored her, now he's marrying her so she won't be talked about badly in town.""

""Oh, Mom! Spare me! The whole town knows Kelly is a shameless woman..."" I lost my patience.

""Catherine, watch your language!"" my father scolded me. ""Look, if you don't want to be around Kelly, fine, but you're going to this wedding. And enough with this rude behavior.""

""I'm what?"" I thought I had heard wrong.

""You're going to your cousin's wedding, Catherine. That's an order! We're your parents, and you'll obey,"" my mother spoke angrily at me as if I were the one in the wrong.

""I'm sorry, Mom, but I won't! I follow your rules, I'm a good daughter, but this time I can't. I was the one who was wronged! I have every right not to want to be the family joke anymore,"" I said, already crying.

""ENOUGH, CATHERINE!"" my father shouted, startling me. ""You're going to this wedding, and that's final.""

""But, Dad...""

""I don't want to hear it, Catherine! It's important to your mother to keep peace in the family. So you're going, period,"" my father said, leaving no room for argument.

I spent the night crying in my room. The next day, I told Melissa everything. She wasted no time and arranged invitations to a masquerade ball, a gala event. She told my parents it would be crucial for my career since the city's most important businesspeople would be there. I could make valuable connections, and our professors had promised to introduce us to various entrepreneurs who could open doors for our professional future.

At first, my parents weren't entirely convinced, but Melissa's parents talked to them and persuaded them that it would be an excellent opportunity for my future. So they agreed that I should take advantage of it.

""Catherine, you can't say no to me! I've already bought the tickets and masks, and I even convinced your parents that this is a super important event for your professional future, which was such hard work. This party is going to be incredible, and you're not going to miss it!"" Melissa looked at me with puppy dog eyes, clasping her hands together as if begging.

I was sitting at my desk at work in the middle of a Thursday afternoon, between taking messages and making calls, when Mel showed up with coffee, chocolate muffins, and this persistence about getting me to agree to go to the masquerade ball, which was the biggest annual event in our city.

""Oh, Mel, how is it that I can never say no to you? Alright, I'll go!""

I agreed to go to the ball, but I still wasn't sure. Either way, I was going to sleep at Mel's house to avoid the wedding, but I wasn't planning on going to the party. However, Melissa kept pushing until she convinced me to go. On Saturday, we got ready at her place.

""Wow, girl! You look absolutely stunning!"" She handed me a beautiful golden mask, intricately designed like lace that covered up to my nose, and I put it on. I was wearing a shimmering red satin dress, and the mask matched perfectly. ""So, are we ready?""

""Yes, we're ready,"" I replied and grabbed my purse. ""Oh, I forgot my perfume.""

""No problem, you can use my mom's new perfume. She won't mind.""

When Fred, Mel's boyfriend, saw us, he smiled, gave Mel a kiss, and said:

""Girls, you look gorgeous! I think you'll leave this party with a new boyfriend, Cat.""

""No boyfriend, Fred. Actually, I think I'd better stay, I'm not in the party mood. Please, Mel, let me stay?""

Chapter 2

There was no way out - my friend dragged me to the ball. As soon as we got in, Mel pulled us to the bar and whispered in my ear:

""It's an open bar tonight, so you're going to drink until all that sadness washes away!"" Mel handed me two tequila shots while holding two more in her hands. ""Let's down these!"" We knocked back the tequila, and Fred was already handing each of us a cosmopolitan.

Melissa dragged me to the dance floor, and I was actually having fun. When a slow song started playing, Fred and Mel began slow dancing together. I took that as my cue to head to the buffet, but I didn't make it there. I felt someone grab my hand, and when I turned around, there was a man in a black mask smiling at me - and what a smile! He kissed my hand and pulled me close, whispering in my ear with a husky voice:

""Surely the most beautiful woman in the room won't deny me a dance, will she?""

""And why not? Let's dance,"" I smiled back at him.

It was impossible to resist that seductive husky voice and that gorgeous crooked smile! He was tall with broad shoulders, had a charming smile and blue eyes - so blue they were almost violet. He had sinfully tempting lips, brown hair, and when he pulled me by the waist, I placed my hands on his chest and could feel he was a wall of well-defined muscle. Although the mask concealed his face, he was very charming and enchanting.

""I've been watching you since you arrived,"" this mysterious man whispered in my ear. ""You're so beautiful!""

""You're kind. But you're not from around here, are you?"" He had a powerful presence, radiating authority.

""No. A friend convinced me to come to this party.""

""Looks like we have something in common - my friends convinced me to come too.""

""Lucky me!""

""And why's that?"" I smiled.

""Because I was captivated the moment I saw you. You're stunning."" As he whispered in my ear, I got goosebumps, feeling my face flush and my body tingle - he truly had me enchanted.

""Even with the mask?""

""Even with the mask! You're too beautiful.""

""You're such a charmer.""

""You think I'm charming?""

""You know you are. And handsome too.""

""I'm glad you like what you see.""

""And what do you do for a living, handsome?"" - I felt a bit dizzy, not sure if it was from the drink or the delicious cologne that man was wearing. I ended up stumbling over my own feet.

""Are you okay?""

""I think I need some air.""

""Come with me."" - He pulled me into a dark hallway that led to an emergency exit and started fanning my face. - ""I really want to kiss you. May I?"" - I nodded yes.

He looked into my eyes, held the back of my neck, and our lips met. It started slow but deepened; he pressed me against the wall, and the kiss intensified even more, almost taking our breath away. When he broke the kiss so we could breathe, we looked into each other's eyes - it was like throwing gasoline on fire. He ran his hand down my waist to my leg and pulled my leg up to his waist. I was completely surrendered by then, feeling his body against mine. I went crazy with desire and pulled him closer, wrapping my leg around his waist.

""You're a great kisser!"" - I smiled at him and felt my whole body tingle.

""Oh, beautiful, you're incredible. I want you so badly, here, right now!"" - he said between kisses and slipped his hand under my dress, pulling it up and reaching my underwear. I was on fire when he put his hand inside my underwear and yelled. - ""Oh! So delicious! So hot, so wet!"" - He said and kissed me harder while unzipping his pants. With a quick movement, like someone who had done this before, he tore my underwear and caressed my entrance, as if asking for permission. He looked into my eyes again and asked: ""What do you want me to do?""

""I want you inside me now!"" I responded shamelessly, already panting with desire. I couldn't resist those eyes and that husky voice. I'd never been like this before - normally, I would have pulled away the moment he grabbed my hand, but tonight I had promised myself to have fun and live in the moment if someone interesting came along. And that's exactly what I was doing, living in the moment.

Hearing me, he entered me slowly, watching as I leaned my head against the wall and savored every inch of him - and he was huge. He took the opportunity to scatter kisses along my neck. When he was fully inside, he paused and whispered between kisses in my ear: ""Now I'm going to move."" He pulled out only to thrust back in with full force this time, and it was incredible. I was completely lost and driven wild by his movements as he moved in and out of me frantically.

We lost control and gave ourselves over completely, as if nothing else existed around us. I felt a haze in my eyes as my climax began to build, and I moaned softly in his ear. At that moment, he seemed to go crazy, lifting my other leg to his waist as I wrapped them around him. Kissing me intensely, he thrust even harder into me - it was heaven on earth. I came again, even more intensely than before, leaving me breathless. As I was coming, he whispered that he was close to his limit feeling me pulse around him, and soon I felt his hot release inside me.

We stayed there against that wall, completely breathless, his forehead resting against mine. While kissing me, he slowly withdrew, and I was thoroughly satisfied - as Melissa would say. I smiled and he looked at me, gave me a soft kiss and said:

""You're truly amazing!""

He gently lowered my legs until my feet touched the ground, fixed my dress, adjusted his pants, and hugged me. It was so intimate, so affectionate - despite the wildness of our encounter and the intensity with which we'd given in to each other, he was still gentle with me. I'd never had such an incredible experience, but I'd only ever been with my ex until now. And my ex had never cared about hugging me afterward, or worried about my pleasure - for him, it was just about getting in and out until he was satisfied. So having a man care about me, about my pleasure, take care of me - it was new, and amazingly so. He kissed my neck and whispered in my ear:

""So, beautiful, I still don't know your name."" It took me seconds to process and finally realize that I'd just slept with a complete stranger whose name I didn't even know.

Just as I was about to speak, he pulled his phone from his pocket and asked for a minute to answer it. He stepped away slightly and I could only hear him raising his voice saying:

""What did you say?"" At that moment, the stranger ran off as if he'd forgotten about me, or as if he was just running away from the woman he'd quickly hooked up with at the party.

Of course, Catherine, you're an idiot! But so what? I was just having fun too, and I didn't even know who the guy was, and he didn't know who I was. All good. I pulled myself together, looked in vain for my underwear - no idea where he'd thrown it - and left that hallway.

I went back to the table and found Mel and Fred making out. They soon stopped and focused on me:

""Mel, I think I found the Big Bad Wolf!"" I laughed, and she laughed with me.

""When we get home, I want to know everything!""

""Of course you do!"" I replied with sparkling eyes.

""Prince, I think we can go now. What do you think, Cat?""

""I'm ready whenever you are!"" I said, downing a glass of water.

""Let's go then, girls!"" Fred said and led us to the exit.

We'd barely gotten home when Mel started demanding:

""Tell me everything - who is he, how it went, how it didn't go, everything.""

I laughed and told her everything. When I finished speaking, my friend was staring at me open-mouthed and asked:

""You guys used protection, right?""

My heart started racing! We hadn't used protection. I shook my head no at her; I was in shock realizing how careless I'd been. She immediately tried to calm me down:

""No, Cat, calm down. I'm sure nothing will come of it. But you should get some tests done to make sure everything's okay. I'm going to the kitchen to make us some tea. Don't freak out!""

Chapter 3

On Monday during lunch, I met Mel. She handed me a small bag from a fancy store, and I looked at her, confused.

""My mom asked me to give this to you. She said it's perfect for you and doesn't suit her,"" Mel said with a big smile.

I opened the bag, and inside was the perfume I had worn to the ball. A huge smile spread across my face. I loved that perfume, and it was part of the best night of my life. I just hoped that my best night hadn't left me with an STD as a souvenir. With that thought, I thanked Mel and told her I'd call her mom later, then mentioned I wanted to call the lab to schedule some tests.

I called the laboratory and was informed that I needed a doctor's prescription to get the tests covered by health insurance. Thank God the company provided health insurance for employees because otherwise, I wouldn't know what to do. My salary wasn't high, and what little was left after covering college expenses went to helping at home, since my mom didn't work outside the house and my dad didn't make much as a driver.

So I made a doctor's appointment, but the earliest available slot was two weeks away, and I waited anxiously. The more days passed, the more nervous I became, though Mel did everything to calm me down. On the scheduled date, she went to the doctor's with me. With the list of tests in hand, she personally scheduled the lab work and insisted on accompanying me. Three weeks had passed since the party when I finally got the tests done. The results came back five days later, and I returned to the doctor. Of course, Mel was with me.

The doctor checked the results and looked me in the eyes:

""Miss Catherine, your health is excellent. You're healthy. But from now on, you'll need to take better care of yourself.""

I breathed a sigh of relief, but was I really about to get lectured by the doctor for having unprotected bedlife with a stranger? Well, I deserved it - not using protection was silly, I could have caught a disease. And then he continued:

""Congratulations, you're conceived! I'm going to refer you to an OB-GYN for prenatal care...""

I didn't hear anything else, just the blood pulsing in my ears. I couldn't believe this! conceived? How would I explain this? It's not possible. Me, of all people, the perfect goody-two-shoes who never stepped out of line, who always considered the consequences before doing anything, who was always responsible - the first time I let rationality slide, I ended up conceived and didn't even know who the father was! Mel held my hand and kept repeating:

""Calm down, Cat, everything will be okay!""

How could everything be okay? I didn't even know who the father was. I would have to tell my parents, their only daughter would break their hearts. They would be disappointed, hate me, and kick me out of the house. How could I explain that I don't even know what the father of my child looks like? I was already hyperventilating. Suddenly, I felt the doctor taking my hand and speaking calmly:

""Easy now, dear! The situation, from what I can see, isn't ideal, but you can't get this nervous, it will harm your baby. Now you have to take care of yourself for the baby's sake. I'm sure the people who love you will support and help you. But you need to calm down because only you can ensure this baby develops healthily and is born strong. Do you understand me?""

I looked at that short, white-haired, slightly chubby gentleman, with his glasses perched on the tip of his nose, and nodded positively. Somehow he calmed me down a bit, maybe because his eyes sparkled with a kindness and understanding that we rarely see these days. The doctor asked his secretary to bring me some chamomile tea, and while I drank it and tried to calm down, he gave all the information to Melissa, who listened attentively.

We left the office and Melissa took me to a diner, saying we needed to eat something. As soon as I sat down, I felt the tears falling. My friend hugged me and told me once again that I wasn't alone. I looked at her and said:

""The only thing I'm sure of right now is that I want you and Fred to be my child's godparents because I know you'll support them and give them lots of love.""

Her eyes sparkled, and she burst into tears, responding between sobs:

""I'll be the best godmother in the world and I'll always be close to our baby! And I'm sure Fred will be very happy too!""

She assured me she would always be by my side, made it clear that I wouldn't go through anything alone, and that she would be with me when I talked to my parents. My parents... oh! I started thinking and decided I wouldn't hide it from them for even a day; I would tell them that very night. I wouldn't go to college, I would go home to talk to them. Mel immediately supported me and said:

""Let's go then, I'm with you!""

When we arrived at my house, my parents were startled, and my mom came right over, worried:

""Girls, didn't you go to class today? Is everything okay?""

""Not really, Mom. I need to talk to you both.""

My parents immediately realized it was something very serious. We all sat in the living room and I told them what was happening, admitting I had been irresponsible by hooking up with a stranger at the party. I obviously didn't go into details, but I made it clear that I couldn't find my child's father again. The disappointment in their eyes was evident. My mother was sobbing uncontrollably, saying I was ruined. My father hadn't said anything yet. Seeing how upset my mother was, Melissa quickly went to the kitchen and came back with a glass of sugar water for her. Melissa always gives sugar water to nervous people, saying it calms them down - I never understood that.

Finally, my father spoke:

""You made a huge mistake and there's no going back.""

My parents were very simple people. My father was a tall, strong man, and my mother was an older version of me, but both had great character and solid principles they always made sure to pass on to me. Hearing my father emphasize that I had messed up made my heart ache even more. I started crying and said:

""I know, Dad, I was irresponsible. But there's nothing I can do now. I'll drop out of college to raise my child. And I'm going to pack my bags...""

""Pack your bags? You're very mistaken if you think you're leaving this house like that. You made a mistake, and you disappointed us, but we love you, we'll get through this and we'll help you. You're not alone, my daughter! And neither is this child!"" My father said this and my heart filled with hope.

""But Dad, I brought shame to you...""

""You're not the first and won't be the last single mother in this world. We would have liked things to be different for you, not so difficult. You've always been so responsible! But if this is how it is, we'll face it together. You won't leave college - more than ever, you need to grow in life to take care of your child. You're going to be a single mother, your responsibility is huge. We'll help you, and even though it will be difficult, everything will work out.""

Melissa was already crying and quickly spoke to my parents:

""Mr. Anthony, Mrs. Selina, you can count on me, I'll help with everything! Besides, I'm this baby's godmother, Cat is like a sister to me, and I'll always be around.""

My parents looked at her gratefully. I looked at those three feeling completely blessed to have them in my life, full of love for them and experiencing a totally new feeling for that little being still growing inside me, whose existence I had just discovered!

As difficult as being a single mother would be, that night at the ball was the best night of my life. I could never forget those violet-blue eyes looking at me with adoration during our furtive encounter and everything my body experienced that night. I would always have that sweet memory with me.

The following months were difficult. I kept the dress, shoes, mask, and perfume that Mel's mother gave me in a box. On difficult days, I would open that box and relive that night in my memory.

Although I had a peaceful pregnancy, people's comments and cruelty were hard to bear. To make matters worse, after they got married, my ex and my cousin moved in with her parents, who lived on the same street as us. They made sure to humiliate me with nasty comments whenever they saw me and spread throughout the neighborhood that I didn't know who my child's father was and that I was a loose woman, which was why Claude had left me. I wanted to end them! Kelly's mother, who was my mother's sister, never missed a chance to come to our house and torment us, saying how fortunate it was that her daughter wasn't like me, that she was a good girl who had married a decent man. She seemed to have forgotten that she had stolen my boyfriend and slept with him in my bed.

But I swallowed it all; it wasn't worth arguing with these people, and I didn't want to transmit negative feelings to my child. As the days went by, I loved that baby more and more. I had no idea such love could exist. Everything I did, I did for him. I would protect him from everything; I would give my life to him. And surprisingly, during the whole time of carrying with a baby, everything seemed to flow in my favor, things were falling into place and working out.

My boss was great, understood my situation, and even gave me a small raise, which was a huge help! Mel and Fred showered me with attention, they were in love with their godchild even before knowing if it would be a girl or boy. They insisted on buying everything for the nursery, which turned out beautiful. Mel accompanied me to all appointments and every test, never missing anything. She even organized two baby showers - one at the company and another at college. My child would come into the world surrounded by love.

I found out I was having a boy and decided to name him Peter. And so it was. Peter was born healthy, with a pair of huge violet-blue eyes that would never let me forget the night that changed my life, but was also the best night I'd ever had! I would never forget that man!

My son was surrounded by love from the first moment. My parents were enchanted by their grandson. Mel and Fred came to our house every day to see their godson and check how we were doing. Mel was always there supporting me in everything. Her parents also came to visit Peter and said they would be honorary grandparents since they considered me their daughter too, which I found beautiful. They also surrounded me with care. They insisted on giving the stroller as a gift, and the day Peter was born, they came to the maternity ward with a huge basket of flowers and welcome balloons.

After my maternity leave ended, my son stayed in my mother's care while I was at work and college. I worked hard and devoted all my time not spent at college or work to my son. With the help of my parents and my son's godparents, I managed everything and didn't miss any semester in college, graduating alongside my friend Melissa. It was a great moment for me and my family. With my diploma in hand, I would now pursue a better future, with the firm purpose that my son would never lack anything.

Chapter 4

When I graduated, Peter was already two years old. By then, he was walking everywhere, always clinging to grandma - which was his first word. He was a beautiful boy with straight black hair, fair skin, a cute little upturned nose, and those huge violet eyes that made me sigh. He was my sunshine! And now I would have more time for him.

After graduation, my boss called me in for a chat. He was an excellent boss and said he was very happy with my work at the company, but he knew I deserved to go far, so I should look for a job in my field, and he would understand. He assured me that my job at the construction company would be mine for as long as I wanted, and if I left and things didn't work out, I would always have a place to come back to. However, he advised that I should seek something in my field of study to provide a better future for my son. I was very touched by this and accepted his good advice.

I told Melissa, and she immediately said she would talk to her father about reaching out to some contacts. It didn't take long before Mr. Oliver Larson, Mel's father, called me to his office and handed me a card, saying:

""Catherine, I know you're an excellent girl and a good professional. I spoke with a friend, and he arranged an interview for you at Miller Group. It's for the position of CEO's assistant. If you get this job, you'll be working in your field at a global company. It's an excellent position, but it's not here in Bellwood. You would have to move to Paradise Port. I know it's a huge step, but I think you should consider it - it will be excellent for you. Anyway, send an email to the address on the card with your response, either declining the position or accepting the virtual interview.""

""Mr. Larson, I don't have words to thank you! You've always been so good to me! Miller Group is one of the largest business conglomerates in the country! Working there is a dream! I'll definitely accept the interview, and if I have to move, I will. I know it will be a great opportunity,"" I said with conviction. It wouldn't be bad to get away from those nasty family members, especially now that ""queen"" Kelly was conceived and her mother decided to ask for all of Peter's things for the child of that dishonest couple! Thankfully, my mom told her that was absurd, but it wouldn't matter anyway since I had already given everything Peter had outgrown to an acquaintance who was conceived. My mom had been very upset with her sister, as she was always dismissing my son, always referring to him as the fatherless boy, which really hurt my mom. Leaving this city, I'll only regret leaving my parents and friends behind, but I know they'll support me once again.

I thanked Mr. Larson and left the office. When I got to my desk, I spoke with my boss, another Mr. Larson, but since he didn't like being called that, I addressed him by his first name:

""Aldo, your brother got me an interview at Miller Group.""

He smiled:

""I know, he just called me. I think you should grab this opportunity. If it doesn't work out, you can always come back.""

I smiled at him and immediately sent an email to schedule the interview. I quickly received confirmation that the interview would be the next day at ten in the morning, and since I had already taken the initiative to send my resume, the interview would be brief.

That night at home, I talked to my parents, who understood, even though they were worried about how I would manage to raise a child alone in another city and got teary-eyed about being far from their grandson. They supported me as always and were happy about the opportunity I received. I asked them not to tell anyone. When Mel arrived - she came every day to see her godson - I told her everything, and she helped me prepare for the next day.

At the time of the interview, I went to the meeting room at my workplace; my boss had given me permission. I sat down and waited for the call. I was interviewed by a very kind and intelligent woman, Mrs. Mariana Taylor. It was very pleasant; we talked for two hours. She gave me all the information about the position, salary, and benefits. At the end, she said:

""Catherine, you're hired! You'll be replacing me since I'm taking a director position at the London branch, so you'll be taking over my position here. I'd like you to start as soon as possible because I'm leaving in ten days and would like to hand everything over to you before I go. And I'd rather not reschedule my departure. When can you start?""

""I just need my boss to release me, but I think I can be there on Monday."" - it was already Friday, would Aldo agree to release me today?

""Perfect. You can send me an email confirmation after you talk to him. Do you have any questions?""

""No, ma'am. Everything is clear.""

""Great! Welcome to Miller Group. I'm sure you'll do very well. I'll see you on Monday.""

She ended the call, and my heart was racing - I had done it. The job was great, the salary even better, and I would have chances to progress. It was a dream. But now it was time to rush and sort everything out.

I immediately went to talk to my boss. He was happy about it, called accounting, and had them process my settlement right away. After that, he let me go, saying I would always have a place to come back if needed, but he knew I would do very well. I thanked him for everything and left. I sent the confirmation email to Mrs. Taylor, saying I would be at the company at eight on Monday morning, and went straight to talk to Mel and her father - I had to thank them. And that's when Mel surprised me:

""Did you think you were going to take my godson away just like that? No way! My father got me an interview at Lynx World in Paradise Port. I'm moving with you, and we'll live together. What do you think?""

This was perfect! I was overjoyed, but quickly asked:

""Mel, what about Fred?""

""Fred has already requested a transfer to the Paradise Port branch at his company; he'll have better opportunities there too. He's coming in fifteen days. Friend, it's a new life for all three of us.""

I was so happy. Mel had orchestrated everything. Fred would drive us there, and she would take care of Peter while I worked until we found a daycare. She already had three daycares to visit, and her father had already made available a furnished apartment in the city for us. It was too good to be true; I was even scared. Noticing this, Mel nudged me and said:

""Learn to accept the good things life offers you!""

I smiled at her, and we went to my parents' house. It was time to break the news and say goodbye. Paradise Port is on the other side of the country, so we wouldn't see each other for a while. My parents were happy until I said I would leave the next morning - then the farewell became sad. It was hard to leave them behind, but it was necessary. With the salary I would receive, I could help them now. That was good.

The next morning, Fred and Mel arrived right on time. Mel's father had given her a pickup truck as a gift, which made moving our stuff much easier. Fred loaded everything into the truck, and off we went - it would be a full day on the road.

We arrived in Paradise Port late Saturday night. Peter was exhausted but had enjoyed himself immensely during the trip - everything was new and exciting to him. We got settled in, ordered some food, and after eating, went to bed. On Sunday, we explored the city to get our bearings. Paradise Port was a huge, modern industrial city on the coast. Its port attracted lots of business, making it a first-world urban center.

The apartment where we would be living was close to one of the daycares Mel had contacted, which was great. It wasn't far from the company either - I could get there in twenty minutes by subway. The apartment was beautiful, with a modern design, great ventilation, and huge windows that let in plenty of natural light. That evening, we dropped Fred off at the airport and headed home to rest. The next day would be a big one - I would be starting my new job, while Mel had her virtual interview and would schedule a meeting with the director of the daycare near our apartment to visit and talk.

I tucked my son into bed; he was worn out from all the fun he'd had today. As I watched him sleeping peacefully, I felt confident that we would have a really good life here. Peter now had his own room, and Mel and I had planned to buy some things to make it feel more personal and give it our own touch. I grabbed the baby monitor and went to my room. I opened one of my boxes and started organizing everything. When I opened the last box, I took out the box containing my memories from the ball night. I opened it, ran my hand over that beautiful dress, and sighed once again. I picked up the perfume and thought, ""Why not?"" Starting tomorrow, I would wear this perfume every day - my salary was good, and when this bottle ran out, I could buy another. I put the box away, left the perfume on the dresser, and went to bed full of expectations for this new life that was opening up before me.

Chapter 5

I showed up at the company at 8:00 a.m. Mrs. Taylor gave me a warm welcome and introduced me to everyone, and they were all very kind. The boss wasn't there - he was traveling and would return at the end of the week. The office was beautiful, very modern, decorated in white with stainless steel and green accents, managing to be both professional and welcoming. It was elegant, and I really liked it. I was particularly glad I had chosen to wear a black suit with a dark green silk blouse underneath and black heels. I would need to dress elegantly every day now, after all, I would be working directly with the company president.

Mid-morning, I received a message from Mel saying she had managed to schedule an appointment with the director of the daycare near our apartment during lunch hour. I explained the situation to Mrs. Taylor and asked if it would be possible to leave during that time, assuring her I would be back on schedule.

""So you have a child. How old is he?"" she asked with a smile.

""He's two years old. He's a very clever little boy. He wasn't planned, but he's the reason for my life!""

""What's his name?""

""Peter.""

""Peter. A strong name. You're not married, I know that, but what about your son's father, are you still together?"" My heart sank - how could I explain to her that I didn't know who the father was? But I don't lie, so let's face the truth. I told her that Peter's father was someone I met at a party and never saw again. She looked at me seriously, but there was no judgment in her eyes. Then she said:

""You have my respect, Catherine. It's not easy being a single mother, and it's very difficult to tell truths like this when you know they might trigger others' judgment. Thank you for your trust and honesty. Go take care of the daycare arrangements for your son, we'll continue this afternoon - no need to rush.""

I thanked her and said goodbye, heading off to meet Mel and Peter. My admiration and respect for Mrs. Taylor only grew. She's a woman in her mid-fifties, with very light blonde hair and almost transparent blue eyes. She's a beautiful and elegant woman, but most importantly, she's very welcoming. We got along very well. During the rest of the morning, she filled me in with information about the work, and I took notes on everything. At lunchtime, I left the building, and Mel was already waiting at the door with Peter. I got in the car, and we went to lunch before heading to the daycare.

Mel and I loved the daycare, and Peter was already fitting in, running around with his new little friends - he's such an outgoing boy. That made me so happy! My son was happy! We decided not to look at other daycares since this one was excellent and very close to home, just three blocks away. We completed the enrollment and sorted out all the details. The director suggested we let Peter stay until the end of the day since he was having fun and could start adapting. Mel agreed to pick him up at the end of the day.

Mel dropped me back at the company and told me she'd head home to prepare for her job interview later in the afternoon. I returned to my office, arriving before Mrs. Taylor. I sat at the desk and started reviewing everything she had already told me. The phone on the desk rang, and I wasn't sure what to do, but since this would be my desk, I answered in my most professional voice:

""Miller Group, Executive Office, good afternoon, how may I help you?""

I heard a deathly silence on the other end followed by a long sigh. Someone spoke up with obvious impatience, in a strong and slightly hoarse voice:

""Put Mariana on.""

I was startled but kept my composure and replied:

""I'm sorry, sir, but Mrs. Taylor hasn't returned from lunch yet. May I help you, or would you like to leave a message?""

""Who is this speaking,"" he asked, even more impatiently.

""My name is Catherine, I'm Mr. Miller's new executive assistant.""

""But I don't know you,"" he seemed to grow more impatient with each word.

""It's my first day here, sir. Would you like to leave a message?""

""Tell Mariana to call me as soon as she sets foot in the office.""

""Certainly, sir. And your name is?""

""Looks like I'm your boss!"" He snapped and hung up.

Wow, what a stressed-out man! This wasn't in the job description. My throat immediately tightened. Had I already made a bad impression on my boss? I was so screwed! I started thinking I wouldn't last long in this job. Shortly after, Mrs. Taylor arrived and I passed on the message with a worried look on my face. She looked at me with a smile, as if understanding my concern, and asked:

""Was he calm?""

I looked at her and couldn't help myself:

""He was on the verge of a nervous breakdown. I'm pretty sure I could see his jugular vein popping out of his neck.""

She burst out laughing and then said:

""You two are going to get along great! You'll tame the beast, I'm sure of it.""

I wasn't so sure about that. Maybe I shouldn't even unpack my bags, this man was going to eat me alive!

1l8yqts,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1l8yqts/night_four_new_job/,"Night Four, new job"," Night Four — The Third Delivery

I came in fifteen minutes early. Not because I wanted to. Because I couldn’t sleep.
My dreams had a sound now. Not a voice. Just the click of the Vault door locking itself.

I brewed the first pot of coffee manually—old habit now, just in case the bean hopper tried anything funny.

The machine gave a faint hiss of steam. No blinking red light. No pulsating beans tonight. Just bitter, black coffee. I considered it a win.


---

11:47 PM — The Note

Under register one, taped next to the petty cash box, was a receipt.

No transaction.

Just words, printed clean and direct:

> “Prepare for third delivery. Do not speak unless spoken to. Do not help carry.”



I didn’t write it.

No one had clocked out since my last shift.

I pocketed the receipt. For now.


---

12:36 AM — The Vault, Again

Needed to restock the Vault. Entered through the ice display door this time—just to prove to myself I could do it correctly.

> Rule Six:
“Never leave through a different door than the one you entered.”



Simple enough. In. Shelves shuffled again, of course. Diet Coke was next to the Monster, and the Monster was behind a stack of Fiji water with no labels.

Not blank—just no language. Like they were waiting to be told what they were.

I turned every can and bottle forward, made the place look neat. I don’t know why I care. It helps.

Halfway through stocking, I heard it.

Not the Vault speaking.

Breathing.

Coming from the interior freezer door.

Soft, patient, like whatever was on the other side had been waiting a long time.

I backed out.

Same way I entered.

Didn’t look back.

Didn’t open the freezer.


---

1:33 AM — Third Delivery Arrives

No headlights. No engine noise.

Just the dull crunch of tires on gravel, and then the doorbell chime—soft, almost hesitant.

Guy walks in.

Navy work shirt, dark pants. ""Genesis Logistics"" stitched into the chest. The old-timers still call it CDC, back when they didn’t know any better.

He had a dolly. Two boxes. No clipboard.

I asked if he needed help.

He shook his head—once. No eye contact.

Just wheeled the dolly to the Vault entrance, left the boxes there. One of them rattled, like loose bones in glass.

I tried to thank him.

He just left.

No receipt. No signature.
No door chime on the way out.


---

1:41 AM — Deliveries and Doors

I opened the main Vault door this time. Proper entrance. Carried the boxes inside.

Stacked them exactly where the floor was slightly darker. Like something had stood there before. For a long time.

I didn’t open them.

Didn’t want to.

But as I turned to leave, the freezer door creaked open—just an inch.

Cold fog rolled out, slow and unnatural. The temperature dropped, but only on my left side.

And then it whispered:

> “Kind… or not?”



The Vault had spoken before.

This was something else.

I backed up. Didn’t respond.

Because I remembered the rule from the tattered list:

> “If the Vault speaks, respond in kindness.”
Not the freezer.



So I left.

Same door I entered. Locked it. Counted to seven.

The freezer stopped creaking.


---

2:37 AM — The Emergency That Wasn’t

The black phone rang.

That never happens without cause.

I picked it up. Hand shaking.

Nothing. Just soft static, like whispering through a long hallway.

Then the voice came.

Not the usual one. This one was clearer. Tired. Calm.

> “You followed the door rule. That matters.”



I didn’t speak. You're not supposed to talk unless they tell you to.

There was a pause. Then, a quiet click. The line went dead.

No code phrase.

That scared me more than if it had.

Because the code phrase means safety.

And if they didn’t give it…

That meant it wasn’t safe yet.


---

3:33 AM — The Return

He came again.

Same man from Night Two. $6.65 on Pump One. Paid with a hundred.

But this time, no smile.

He didn’t even look at me. Just handed the money over, waited.

I processed the transaction. Printed the receipt. Went to place it in the register one box.

Found something already there:

> A wrapped piece of candy.
And a note:
“Don’t forget the girl. You haven’t seen her yet—but she’s seen you.”



My chest went cold.

I never told anyone about Rule Five.


---

4:01 AM — The Freezer Door

Just before the shift ended, I checked the Vault one last time.

The main door was fine.

But the freezer door—the one that leads to the ice display—was slightly ajar.

I hadn’t used it.

Inside, nothing but stacked ice bags… and a single six-pack of water bottles.

The labels were blank.

But one of the bottles had something inside it.

A key.

A real one. Old brass. No label. No ring.

Just a key.

And attached to it, taped crudely:

> “Breakfast Bite. Potato Split Top Bun.”



I left it where it was.

It started at 13, constantly causing issues in the house with emotional disturbances, fights, reckless behavior. I (barely) graduated high school and immediately went to college in Philadelphia, PA. Ironically enough it was the same college my sister had previously attended. While my sister attended school there, my mom would constantly go down to see her, bring her and the girls she loved with food and decorations. But when I went to the same school, my mom only visited me ONCE, on my graduation day. 

While I was school, I fell into a very deep and dark hole of anorexia. I’m talking 5’8” weighting 74 lbs. After years of it, I fully recovered with no impatient or hospitalization. My sister never checked in on me. In stead, she constantly told me how selfish I was and to “snap out of it”. Never caring or offering support. 

At 22 I was misdiagnosed with Bipolar. And at 28 I was finally correctly diagnosed with BPD. 

My sister treats me like dog shit. She makes no effort to have a relationship with me and clearly resents the life I have chosen for myself. (She is married to a man she met on their first day of class at college, and have a 1.5 child). And clearly my entire family thinks her traditional life is way more preferable. While I am single, working 3 jobs, and no kids. My parents constantly tell me her treatment is “due to years of having to deal with me having constant issues, therefore resulting in more attention(?).

But back to the initial question, I told my mom I feel she favors my sister. They do everything together. She watches my nephew multiple times a week for free. But she can’t seem to ever make time for me make a coffee run or go for a walk. Oh, and I live with my parents as of this year. She has told me “her and I just get along better and have more common interests”. Instead of making any interest to get to know mine. This is reaaaaally summarizing WAY more lore. But, my mom said it’s the most hurtful thing I’ve ever said.

I have gotten a few DMs from people wondering if I made it through my parents' visit. I did make it through, but my relationship with my mother did not. We are currently not on speaking terms... well, to be more specific, I am not on speaking terms with her, she has been refusing to accept that. 

The weekend after my post, we had made plans to meet at 10am. They showed up at 8am. Ready to go, with no place to go. They made plans to stay for so long, but made zero plans to fill that time, thinking I would magically come up with something to do. At 8am on a Saturday morning. Like, I can't even think straight due to lack of coffee at this hour (I am not a morning person) and have no idea where my bra is, but sure, I'll pull out something to do from my ass. 

They were just like ""let's just do what you normally would do on a weekend!"" which... no. 1) It'd be physically impossible for them to do, considering my mother probably needed a walker a decade ago, but refuses to use because it ages her... 2) They have no interest in video games or board games. Already tried getting them to play a board game previously and my mom stuck her nose up at that, and 3) Lots to do here, but 95% of the things worth doing is outdoors. My mom cries her head off if it's over 71 degrees outside. It's always ""I'm melting! It's too hot! I'm meeeeelting."" Like she is the Wicked Witch of the (Mid) West. Also, my family and I don't really go out every weekend. We like being home, we like being alone.

So there I was, scouring the internet for things to do with elderly people who can't walk in our area (and still getting hit with ""go hike here or there or over there!"") while wondering if parent day care was thing. Mom was chatting with my husband, when she decided to start talking about her favorite subject: Emma, my stepsister/her stepdaughter. 

The way she gushes about Emma makes you think Emma shits out gold nuggets and pukes up diamonds, emeralds, and rubies, all while having the cure to cancer in her head. When our parents got married, she kept asking me ""Why can't you be more like Emma?"" Like idk mom, maybe because I'm still a teenager while Emma is pushing 30 (at the time.) Naturally Emma was going to be ""more ahead"" in life. But from the day they married until now, I was constantly compared to Emma, told to be like Emma, and occasionally called Emma. When I had a mental breakdown in my early 20s and ended up in the psych ward, I was told to get over it or turn to God. But when Emma had a similar situation, it was all ""she needs all the help she can get!"" Emma marries a shit stain of a man who abused her, and my mom is ready to scorch the world. But when I was dating a guy who turned abusive, it was my fault. 

You get the idea. 

I have no real issue with Emma. Though, it took me quite a bit in therapy to get to the point where I am no longer resenting her. These days we are mainly FB friends, liking each other's random photos. 

So she is gushing to my husband about Emma, I'm only half listening until I hear her say, clear as fucking day, ""Emma is like the daughter I never had."" My husband and her husband went deer-in-headlights shocked. My son (18) said ""wtf."" Took my daughter (14) a few seconds longer to process what she heard, but even she caught it (she's not a morning person either.) I basically just said, ""Well, guess that's that, you can get the fuck out now."" 

Of course, I was hit with the ""what did I do?"" bit. My son repeated what she said, so she started her gaslighting bullshit. ""You took it the wrong way! That's not what I meant!"" Etc. Etc. Etc. I think with the help of those who commented on my last post, I shined up my backbone a little because I just told her to get the fuck out. My husband says I told her ""If you don't have a daughter, then why the fuck do I have some crusty old farts in my house?"" and threatened to throw all her shit out the window. I don't remember saying any of that, but my son backs it up. I don't remember a lot in the few minutes it took to get her tossed out.  

After she finally left my house, I broke down crying and got sick. I don't do confrontation very well...

She keeps trying to call, text, email me. My husband managed to get her blocked on my phone, so at least I don't get bombarded with calls and texts anymore. (First day, before I blocked her, I had over 50 missed calls and 40 text messages from her. She also managed to fill up my voicemail, not that I listened to any of it. Husband deleted all of them for me too.) She only has my old email account, that I use for spam now, so not really seeing those either, though last I looked, over a week ago, there were around 20 emails just from her. Starting to get a few letters in the (snail) mail from her too, so oh joy.

Guess she told some sob story to Emma too because she reached out to me. Luckily, she listened to my side and just told me, ""Good for you."" She also told me she has never been a huge fan of my mom, for reasons like this, but only plays nice and stays civil for her dad's sake. Made me feel a little better knowing that Saint Emma dislikes her too.

I was a mess for about a week after everything happened. Still am a mess, but less so. My husband and kids have been working hard to distract me and I have been keeping up with my therapy sessions every week (she even got me in for an emergency session the next Monday.) Luckily, my summer is about to get busy... Husband is taking a month off, having a garage sale, preparing to move to a new state, getting my son ready for college, so I will have plenty to do to keep my mind off things. 

I did tell my kids they were allowed to have a relationship with either grandma or grandpa, but they were both like, ""nah, they made my mom cry!"" Then they proceeded to kick my ass in Mario Kart. ",23,1749662944.0,BoomersBeingFools,5,1.0,False

While the city still pulses with the rhythm of country music and Southern charm, it's also become a sophisticated destination where luxury hotels rise alongside historic venues and trendy boutiques complement traditional barbecue joints.

The hotel's 125 rooms and suites feature **handcrafted furnishings, Italian linens, and deep soaking tubs** that make you want to extend your stay indefinitely. What really sets The Hermitage apart is its legendary service – staff members seem to anticipate your needs before you even realize them.

Celebrity chef **Jean-Georges Vongerichten** oversees the culinary program, ensuring that dining here is as memorable as your accommodations. Room rates typically start around $300-500 per night, but the experience is worth every penny for those seeking Nashville's most prestigious address.

# Neighborhood Guide: Where to Stay in Nashville

Choosing the right neighborhood can significantly impact your Nashville experience. Each area offers distinct advantages depending on your interests and travel style.

# Downtown - Heart of Music City

**Downtown Nashville** remains the top choice for first-time visitors. This compact area houses the majority of Nashville's major attractions, including the Country Music Hall of Fame, Ryman Auditorium, and the famous Broadway strip with its honky-tonk bars and live music venues.

The **Lower Broadway Historic District** buzzes with activity from morning until late night, featuring everything from traditional honky-tonks like Robert's Western World to upscale restaurants like The Southern Steak & Oyster. You'll find the greatest concentration of hotels here, from luxury properties to budget-friendly chains.

**Pros:** Walking distance to major attractions, extensive dining options, vibrant nightlife, easy transportation to other neighborhoods **Cons:** Can be crowded and noisy, especially on weekends, higher hotel rates during peak seasons

# The Gulch - Modern Luxury

**The Gulch** represents Nashville's contemporary side, featuring sleek high-rises, upscale boutiques, and innovative restaurants. This former industrial area has transformed into one of the city's most fashionable neighborhoods.

The area offers **excellent dining options** like Biscuit Love for brunch and L.A. Jackson for rooftop cocktails. The famous ""What Lifts You Wings"" mural provides Instagram-worthy photo opportunities, while the Station Inn offers authentic bluegrass music in an unassuming venue.

# Music Row - Industry Central

**Music Row** offers an inside look at Nashville's music industry, housing recording studios, record labels, and music publishers in converted houses along 16th and 17th Avenues. This area provides a more intimate Nashville experience away from the tourist crowds.

You can tour **historic RCA Studio B** where Elvis Presley and other legends recorded hits, or simply walk the streets where music history was made. The neighborhood's central location provides easy access to both downtown attractions and Midtown's dining scene.

**Pros:** Rich music history, central location, quieter than downtown, authentic Nashville atmosphere **Cons:** Limited hotel options, fewer dining choices within walking distance, requires transportation to major attractions

# Budget-Friendly Nashville Accommodations

Nashville doesn't have to break the bank. Several well-located properties offer comfortable accommodations at reasonable rates, particularly if you're willing to stay slightly outside the downtown core.

**TownePlace Suites Nashville Downtown** provides extended-stay amenities including full kitchens and spacious suites, making it ideal for longer visits or families. The property's location across from the Musicians Hall of Fame puts you within walking distance of major attractions.

**Hampton Inn & Suites Nashville Downtown** offers reliable comfort and complimentary breakfast, helping stretch your travel budget. Many budget-friendly chains maintain properties in or near downtown, typically ranging from $120-200 per night depending on season and demand.

For those seeking unique accommodations, **vacation rentals in neighborhoods like East Nashville or Germantown** can provide local flavor at competitive rates, especially for groups or extended stays.

# Insider Tips for Booking Nashville Hotels

**Timing matters significantly** when booking Nashville hotels. Peak seasons include summer months, major music festivals, and college football weekends. Booking 2-3 months in advance typically yields the best rates, though last-minute deals sometimes appear during slower periods.

**Consider package deals** that include tickets to attractions or dining credits. Many hotels offer music-themed packages that include Grand Ole Opry tickets or recording studio tours. These packages often provide better value than booking components separately.

**Weekday stays** generally offer lower rates than weekends, particularly at business-focused properties. If your schedule allows flexibility, Sunday through Wednesday stays can yield significant savings.

**Parking costs** vary dramatically between properties. Downtown hotels may charge $25-45 per night for valet parking, while some suburban properties offer free parking. Factor these costs into your total accommodation budget.

**Loyalty programs** can provide significant value, especially at chain properties. Elite status often includes complimentary breakfast, room upgrades, and late checkout – particularly valuable in a city where you might be out late enjoying the music scene.

# Conclusion

Nashville's hotel scene perfectly mirrors the city itself – a harmonious blend of historic charm and modern sophistication. Whether you choose the timeless elegance of The Hermitage Hotel, the artistic flair of Noelle, or the industrial chic of Thompson Nashville, you'll find accommodations that enhance rather than simply house your Music City adventure.

The key to choosing the perfect Nashville hotel lies in understanding your priorities. Music lovers might gravitate toward Music Row properties, while nightlife enthusiasts will appreciate downtown's energy. Luxury seekers have exceptional options in The Joseph or Union Station, while budget-conscious travelers can find comfortable accommodations that don't compromise on location.

Remember that Nashville's compact downtown area means that most hotels provide easy access to the city's main attractions, whether you're catching a show at the Grand Ole Opry, exploring the Country Music Hall of Fame, or simply soaking up the atmosphere along Broadway. In true Nashville fashion, whichever hotel you choose, you'll be welcomed with genuine Southern hospitality that makes every visitor feel like they belong in Music City.",1,1749662935.0,TicketToEverywhere,0,1.0,False
1l8yoz1,https://www.reddit.com/r/thepapinis/comments/1l8yoz1/what_is_the_most_responsibility_james_could_have/,What is the most responsibility James could have had?,"I was watching the HBO documentary yesterday and I struggle to explain some of James's actions. But I also can't accept Sherri's explanations for them.

1. The initial pick-up. Sherri can't have thought they were just going to a motel or for lunch. Why would she have put her phone on the ground, if so? Why not leave it at the house, or take it with you? If he forced her into the car, why were the headphones rolled up and placed neatly on the ground? The original story was that she put the phone down because she was threatened with a gun, which I have to assume she never claimed about James because James has never had a gun. Sherri now seems to suggest that she was unconscious the whole way there. How? Did James jump out and stick her with a hypodermic needle? What drug could have done that? I think the only explanation for putting the phone on the ground is staging an abduction.
2. The bruises. Did James himself put any of the bruises on Sherri? It doesn't sound like he did in his telling. Could Sherri have put them on herself?
3. The brand. No one denies James put it there. Sherri says she was tied down for it. James says she hiked her shirt up and asked for it. Wouldn't there be ligature marks in the coffee table legs if Sherri was tied to it? Why didn't James remember what the brand said if he came up with it?
4. Food. James says she refused to eat, Sherri says he starved her. Impossible to say which is true.
5. Letting her go. Why did James let her go with a chain and zip ties on if he'd actually abducted her or held her against her will?
6. Lack of sexual contact. Sherri explains that James got off by hurting her, not sex. But she'd lived with James. Was James always like this, or did he develop such an extreme BDSM fetish that he was not interested in actual sex and torture only in the years since they'd lived together? Why did they never have sex (or why didn't he rape her?)
7. Sherris mom's version: Sherri went with him willingly, but then got in over her head with a violent nut. Again, Sherri says she was unconscious the whole way down there and drugged. Also, was James suddenly violent after several years? If James was violent, why didn't Sherri know that already?

IDK, as bizarre as James's actions are, and as much as I don't want to insist on a ""perfect victim"" narrative, I really do believe James here. I think his story, insane as it is, makes more sense.",3,1749662925.0,thepapinis,0,1.0,False

🤘 Big into rock & metal — always down for gigs

🎮 Gamer — mostly into single-player games across genres

🎬 Into Marvel and all things nerdy

🏎️ I love go-karting and visiting theme parks

🧠 Neurodivergent — emotionally aware, open-minded, and a good listener

What I’m not looking for:

One-word replies

Inconsistent or low-effort conversations

Surface-level chats with no intention of building something real

What I am looking for:

People who want real connection and are willing to put in effort

Sonic: The 2022 Game Awards “Players’ Voice” when Sonic Frontiers was up against Genshin 

* Both fandoms went **nuclear**:
   * Sonic fans mobilized to “*finally give the Blue Blur the recognition he deserves*.”
   * Genshin fans rallied just as hard, backed by an enormous global playerbase.
* Twitter turned into a **battleground**.
   * Accusations of botting.
   * Accusations of brigading.
   * Accusations of SEGA or miHoYo influencing the vote.
* Memes, insults, and desperation flooded timelines. 

but, It was less about the award and more about finally seeing Sonic *respected* after years of being a meme or a joke.

  
GTA:  the “Video Games Cause Violence” crowd has always had it out for GTA since the *Hot Coffee* scandal and beyond  but the 2022 GTA VI leak was the true low point for Rockstar, at least in terms of control over their own legacy.

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I was busting my ass applying for jobs but he didn't see that. So I started going to the gym everyday at 6am like I had a job that I had to be at by 9am. At first it was initially to shut him up but I actually learned to like it, I had a sense of accomplishment very first thing in the morning. It felt good knowing I worked harder than most people who are dragging themselves into work waiting for a cup of coffee to wake them up. Long story short I landed a good career and It has been something I've kept up for 15 years now and with kids of my own I have to get up even earlier.

1l8yi3w,https://i.redd.it/g8qh19mlsa6f1.jpeg,Hot takes on some clones. And a new buyers insight.,"For starters, I.. like most of you I imagine, religiously look at this sub to try and find clones that you guys describe as good or that I'll enjoy.. which is incredibly difficult in a space where everything is personal preference. Then I'll go watch a review of it.. and even when a lot of the comments are praising a clone, it's one person saying it smells like detergent that'll steer me away. My goal is to make a collection that I like to wear, is versatile, makes me feel good, and hopefully is all mass appealing and will actually get used, and not left on my shelf. I have smelt everything many times at Sephora, and Macy's over the past month and that's how I determine if I want to get a clone of a specific thing. I generally like sweet vanilla and semi masculine scents. 

Now for the HOT takes. Keep in mind, everyone has a different noses and most of these are more of first impressions, rather than full on wearing these for weeks review. All purchased from Jomashop.

CDN Intense man - I have a 2023 batch, where the opening is SUPER harsh and the dry down is apparently exactly like creed aventus. This is my LEAST favorite, overly bearing, manly, in your face cologne.. it hurts to smell. Again, that's that personal preference because you guys love this haha. This was my first blind buy in 2023, and again. The regret made me not buy clones until a few days ago (over 2 years later). 

Lattafa Asad  PD 12/24- It's good and wearable, but really lacks the complexity of dior sauvage elixir, no licorice note(which is the best part), linear and doesn't change much through the dry down. And when it does dry down it stays on the fresh spicy and amber whereas the og has more of a soft spicy aromatic note that I like much more. This is more of a remix rather than a clone and that's fine. It's good, but not AMAZING in my opinion, especially when compared to the og.

Liquid Brun PD 1/25 - Currently it smells like burnt apple pistachio, so I'll let it macsterbate and get back to ya. This was a blind buy, and hopefully it's not supposed to smell like burnt apple pistachio. I've only had it for 2 days.

Lattafa Kingdom PD 03/25 - Currently it smells like vanilla tar and NOTHING like jpg elixir so.. Again, I'll let it macsterbate and update you. I've only had it for 2 days.

Lattafa Suqraat - I've not tried profumo but I have tried the og, and profundo and parfum, apparently parfum is pretty similar to profumo. This has a similar DNA to ADG, it's feels like a hybrid of profundo and parfum. It has the same kind of grassy smell. It's lacking the depth and complexity of parfum but the dry down is more of a profundo smell. People often say a percent. I'd say this is a remix/hybrid, not a clone. It's not amazing. I'd probably exchange this for Jorge Di Profumo. Or maybe there just isn't a good clone for this.

Lattafa Khamrah Qahwa PD 11/24 - Probably one of the most glazed on this subreddit and.. I get it. I blind bought this, and I don't have regrets haha. The most apt description would be a Christmas chocolate store that serves coffeee. Very edible, starts off with strong cardamom cinnamon vanilla, and works into a dry down of praline vanilla goodness with that lingering coffee smell. This is what I imagine santa's elves smelling like.  I don't know how ""wearable"" this is, you kind of smell like a christmas candle. I will say, in terms of depth and complexity, this truly smells like a niche $300 dollar cologne. Where the others don't (so far).

In conclusion. I'm not satisfied with my recent pick ups yet. I'm here hoping that Liquid Brun and Lattafa Kingdom turn into beautiful vanilla smelling masterpieces after they macsterbate each other in a dark corner of my dresser for a few weeks. While I contemplate and wait for either Vulcan Feu or Mango Ice to come back into stock so I can continue my never ending search to fill a void that surely these cheap cologne gambles will fill. Maybe I'll try the french whore? But I've been told it's a generic soapy smell? I definitely need some summer fragrances and I'm open to all recommendations.  

  
I'll definitely do an update on how these colognes develop over the next week/months.

However, for the last couple of years I feel drained. The way students behave in the classroom these days takes a toll on your mental health, I keep teaching the same things year after year and overall, I have felt out of place when I was in school lately. 

Before that, I worked in a lovely café for over a year. It was very fast paced but I truly enjoyed the daily interactions with the customers, the way I could just switch off after getting home and the relationship with colleagues - somehow in school I just couldn’t resonate with what other teachers said or were.. 

So for the last few months, I have being toying with the idea of becoming a barista and I have been weighing the pros and cons compared to the teaching job. Sure, pay will be lower, holidays are way shorter. However, when I worked at the café, I was more social, I didn’t struggle with mental health… I was happy. (And I looove coffee!!)

I have just applied for a barista trainee at a café in my town (you have to start somewhere!) and I’m kinda excited to be picked 🤞🏼. Also, financially wise, I have no children - I don’t intent to at the moment - and I have made a decent emergency fund over the last few years.

Now my question is: am I crazy? 🤣 on the one hand, I feel ‘old’ making this moment now but on the other hand, why not? One shouldn’t be tied to the same job forever. It’s okay to experiment and change and who knows? I could be a nice career out of it! 

Has anyone changed careers in their mid 30s? How did it go? Are you happier now? What did your family/partner feel about it? Did they support you?

This is a long post, so if you stick it out and offer advice, it’s truly appreciated.

I grew up in a home where children were seen, but not heard. Feelings were frowned upon and not expressed for being “weak”. We went to our rooms and left to our own devices for most of the time since both parents worked long hours. I personally took to “corn” at a young age and thought that was what love was between a man and woman. My birth father left my mother for another woman when I was 6, and my mother married my stepfather who is narcissistic. There was no love and still isn’t after over 30 years. This is the model that I saw and wanted to do the opposite of. 

I met my now wife when I was 17 years old. We are now both in our early 40s. We slept together on our first date and it was the common thread between us. We both have abandonment issues. I was anxious and gave everything in me to her despite my own needs. In hindsight, I had no idea what my needs were. 

We married when I was 19, after I had been in the military for about a year and a half. I deployed a lot and was gone training a lot. I was an infantry guy and deployed to iraq a few times early in my career. I retired three years ago. In 2005 I was deployed to a combat zone where unspeakable things happened, and I don’t believe my soul ever left that awful country. That was 2006 when I left there. I never talked about the things I saw and did, just stuffed it down and put a lid over it. Ive felt dead on the inside since.

I always gave my wife everything because I thought “happy wife, happy life”. She never had to want for anything. I wanted to give her everything because she grew up in a dysfunctional neglectful and abusive home and went without alot. She has a very codependent view and it’s kinda smothering for me. She is the total opposite of me and we have no common interests other than our teenage son.  

About two years ago I found out that I was in financial ruin as she had mishandled our finances for almost our entire 20 year marriage. She never mentioned anything about how bad off we’re were until I had no money left and weeks til payday. I felt very taken advantage of and hurt that she hid it from me. I had to take out a massive Heloc loan to pay off debt just to get our heads above water. I accepted responsibility that because i left so often she should handle finances. I never offered to help since there was no indication of how bad It was. I was deployed or training so often that I had to hand that over or else things wouldn’t have gotten paid. The whole thing left me very empty and I had even had S ideations. 

I decided to go to the VA to get some help with the old combat trauma, and was told that I had a “moral injury” because the acts go against our/my perception of morally right and wrong. I started to work on my values, read “There’s a hole in my love cup”, and started making headway bettering myself. My wife was stuck in another depressive funk, which she frequently had/has, after she reinjured herself after surgery. I couldn’t pull her out, so I let her do her thing until she let me know she needed me. She didn’t. She just doomscrolled silently on her phone.

Here’s where it all got worse. I had a lady friend who worked for a non-profit that I donated to from my business. She met me for coffee one day so I could make a donation and we chatted for a while getting to know each other more. We became closer friends. I started going to the gym almost daily, and she would meet me for coffee a few times a week afterwards. Then we went to dinner, and hikes. We kinda opened up and were vulnerable with each other and became really close. I started to get feelings back even though they were very new to me. I started to be in touch with my “gut” again and it made my attitude more positive, my business was thrive, and life just seemed to flow effortlessly. I felt alive for the first time that i can remember.

Before my friend and I got a little too close, I tried opening up to my spouse as a lifeline. I was going through some heavy stuff and looked for support. I figured she was my spouse, I should be able to open up and express my deepest feelings to her and she should be able to hear that and assist me with direction. This was not what happened. I got told my combat “trauma” wasn’t that bad and that I can’t keep bringing that up (I used it for context to express what I was doing in therapy), I opened up about something hurtful she said and I got thrown back in my face and denied, and I had a panic attack for the first time ever and i caught her and her friend laughing at my expense afterwards. These things made me shut down emotionally to her. It’s back to the same old nothing is wrong and dead inside again. 

I learned what I had with my friend was an emotional affair (it never became a PA)and I feel awful about it looking back. She had the values and qualities that I admire and we had lost of common interests that we like to do. I haven’t really talked or seen her in about a year, but even this long after, I still can’t shake the feelings, instincts, and feeling of aliveness that I had. It’s gone now and I’m not sure how to get back to that point. I separated from my wife about 8 months ago. I spoke about us separating to my son and he understands that sometimes some people grow apart and in different directions. I didn’t want him to see both his parents miserable and think it was the way a marriage is supposed to be. 

I started seeing my wife again about two months ago and even the absence didn’t help foster romantic feelings for her. I just spent two weeks in the wilderness with my son and had everything I needed and felt alive again. When I returned home, back to the numbness. I’m sick of living like this knowing something better is out there in the universe. 

So how do I get that feelings/gut again? I want to tell my wife the truth that happened but I know that will absolutely crush her. It’s not to guilt her, but in the hopes that she understands that the emptiness exists when we are together, and I don’t feel like carrying that anymore. How do you give credence to your feeling if you struggled with them for so long? How do you tell someone you’ve been with for so long and just don’t “feel it” anymore? 

In a last ditch effort, I have started to see her more frequently and have started couples counseling in hopes to spark something there again. I truly believe our relationship and marriage was based on lust rather than love. This whole thing has left me so confused and lost in my head.

But do you have an opinion and a reasoning behind it. That would help me… hesitate even more probably 😂😭

Also, the boxes will go and a wooden pine shelf will replace them. The coffee table would be okay I feel if the couch is a little warmer. ",1,1749662278.0,HomeDecorating,3,1.0,False

1l8ye3w,https://www.reddit.com/r/AIMasterMindNetwork/comments/1l8ye3w/on_ai_and_voice_actors_how_pocholo_gonzales_is/,On AI and voice actors: How Pocholo Gonzales Is cloning himself so his voice can work while he sleeps,"# In an age where AI has voice actors on edge, the Philippines’ “VoiceMaster” is already training the bots himself.

I met Pocholo Gonzales about twenty years ago. It was the dawn of Web 1.5, considered the precursor years to social media, a time when the Internet was slowly entering its wireless phase in coffee shops, and of course the invention of the word “podcasting” thanks to the iPod. He was an industry pioneer, bringing voices online into the digital space. Into iTunes. Into YouTube. It was more than just the dubbing and recording for commercials. I think he, like many other tech luminaries at that time, saw the Internet as the great equalizer for talent. 

Pocholo, blessed with a face that never seems to age, has a voice that follows suit. If you’ve never seen him in person, you’ve probably heard his voice – or his voices: he’s been the VO dubbing talent and director behind popular shows and characters like Meteor Garden, Kuro Chan, Kaiju No. 8, Gaslight District, Murder Drones, among others.

I’ve kept in touch with the man throughout the years and I was really curious to know, in this age of AI and voice cloning, where he stands in the industry. Does he defend the craft and profession of voice artists like himself citing AI ethics, or is he of the more ”‘progressive” sink or swim type. His influence and leanings bear weight in the industry, as he’s trained over 10,000 artists to find and own their voices through CreatiVoices Productions and the Certified Voice Artist Program (CVAP).

After speaking to him I’ve come to realize there’s a deeper conversation to be had, and it has to do more with voice artists being comfortable with lending out their voices, cloning themselves into literally what AI could be doing for your profession. While many creatives are still wondering if AI will take their jobs, Pocholo “The VoiceMaster” Gonzales is already years ahead—because his AI voice is literally working for him while he sleeps.

In the age of AI, which literally just happened during the latter part of the pandemic, his voice has already been used millions of times worldwide, and he isn’t losing sleep over it. In fact, he’s leaning into AI so hard, he cloned his own voice through ElevenLabs and made it teach, host, and inspire on-demand.

“Imagine—Pocholo, on repeat, and on purpose,” he told me. “This isn’t ego. It’s my legacy powered by AI.”

It’s a bold, unapologetic pivot in an industry where most artists are still cautiously toeing the line between fear and fascination. But for Pocholo, AI didn’t kill voice acting—it exposed who’s coasting and who’s creating.

“AI didn’t end VO,” he says. “It ended mediocrity.”

# Your voice is a product

Voice acting in the AI era is no longer about booking gigs—it’s about building digital products. Think voice clones, teaching tools, AI hosts, dataset creation, and licensing your likeness.

“Kung boses lang ang kaya mong ibenta, maghanda ka,” he says. “But if you have a message and a mindset, AI will amplify you.” (If all you can sell is your voice, you better prepare for the worst. But if you have a message and a midset, AI will amplify you.)

Working together with ElevenLabs, a service that offers AI voice overs and voice-activated assistants, Pocholo helped create the first AI voices that actually sound like real Filipinos—not some neutral English accent with a vague Southeast Asian tone.

“Before, yung Filipino voice parang extra lang. Now? Headline. And I made sure of that. I fought to put our rhythm, accent, and story into the global AI voice library. Ngayon, may AI voices na nagsasabing “Tara na!” at “Kaya mo ‘yan!”—at tunog totoong Pinoy.” (Before, the Filipino voice was an oversight. An extra. I fought to put our rhythm, accent, and story in the global AI voice library. Now, we have AI voices that can say “let’s go!” or “you can do it! And it really sounds authentic.)

I realized that I’ve actually used these voices. I’ve been an ElevenLabs paid subscriber for a while and have used their library of voices for VO for event coverages. I had no idea this effort – this advocacy was started by him. I was able to find really good Filipino VO’s that have the signature Filipino accents in English. They’re scary-accurate. I’ve included a sample of what I’m talking about below.

# When tech outpaces legislation

While discussions around AI ethics and copyright continue, Pocholo is all about adaptation over hesitation. “Bureaucracy is dial-up,” he tells me. “AI is 5G.” In short—if you’re waiting for the system to protect you, you’re already obsolete.

That’s why at CVAP, he teaches voice artists how to license their voice, own their IP, and evolve into voice entrepreneurs. Because as far as he’s concerned, legislation may come and go, but ownership is everything.

“Your growth,” he says, “will always be your greatest protection.”

# Clone wars

In a time when many creatives feel threatened by machines, Pocholo Gonzales has flipped the script. He doesn’t see AI as a rival—it’s his distribution partner. And that’s the difference.

Where others see competition, he sees scale.

Where others see extinction, he sees evolution.

“I always say, voice isn’t just for entertainment,” he tells me. “It’s for education. It’s for transformation.”

Her smug smile was firmly in place,"# From the First Page to the Final Blow—Complete Recap, Reaction & Reading Access

Chapter One

""Please don't do this."" I begged over and over, but no one was listening. ""I am your luna."" I screamed at the top of my lungs, but then his laugh from the other room broke all the fight in me.

""Luke please."" I begged once more time, my voice horse.

""Take it once it's done. Toss her out. She will have to survive on her own from here on out.""

He can't mean that. This was our baby.

""Is a mistake from the Moon Goddess. One I will rectify."" His voice called again from the other room. He wouldn't even face me. ""Now do it. That's a command.""

""Yes, Alpha.""

""Oh, and doctor?"" Her sweet voice called from the other room. My stepsister, Shannon. I gritted my teeth. ""Don't use any anesthetic. She should feel everything.""

""Yes, Luna."" The doctor turned back to me with sad eyes, but when he picked up the scalpel, I knew I was screwed.

I'm sorry, baby. Momma couldn't save you. I tried to rub my stomach, but the nurses had strapped me down. When the doctor approached, I realized he was using a silver blade.

""Silver?"" My whisper was almost silent, but he nodded. I knew then that Shannon didn't want me to survive. She wanted my life so badly that she lied about me cheating on my mate, showing photos as proof.

I cried silently as the doctor cut into my abdomen, and I felt my baby thrash inside. He knew it was too early to be born. This was a death sentence for both of us.

""Bring me the body of the pup.""

""Yes Alpha.""

I felt every slice as he cut into me, and finally I could take it no longer. I thrashed against the restraints. But the silver had made me weak.

""Doctor, now.""

""Yes Alpha."" The doctor picked the baby up and rushed out, leaving me spread open to the elements.

I felt my life slipping away as the door opened and Shannon came in. Her smug smile was firmly in place.

""I told you I would take your life, Amy. I would have your mate. "" Shannon walked over and laid a kiss on my face as I snarled. ""He is perfection. And don't worry. I will give him another son."" She laid her hand on her stomach and I started to laugh. ""What's so funny?""

""I can smell the beta on you. That's Derek's child, and it's a girl. Nice try though.""

She snarled and raised her hand, growing her claws to deliver the final blow, but the door was ripped open and my mate, the man I now hated most in the world, stepped inside. His eyes were red, and I started to laugh again.

""You runt!"" He snarled and struck out, whipping Shannon to the other side of the room.

""Brandon!"" Shannon shrieked as she hit the wall. ""What's wrong?"" She staggered to her feet, but more blood dripped out of me and I closed my eyes.

""You lied!"" He screamed, shaking the walls as his aura struck out, but I could barely feel it. I felt the silver travelling in my veins getting closer to my sluggish heart. ""This was my pup. I can smell me on him."" Brandon's eyes grew redder as the tears gathered. ""She did cheat on you. I guess I was wrong about the pup.""

""You said you smelt it."" From the sound of it, he lunged for her again, but him clutching our baby in his arm was the last thing I saw. And I wanted to never see it again. He did this to us. Not Shannon.

She played her part well, sure, but him not believing me, not waiting for a few more days to smell the pup, that was his fault. And all of our downfalls.

I prayed for the moon goddess to take me. I no longer wanted to be here. I wanted to be with my pup.

""Save her.""

""No!"" Shannon screamed. ""I am the Luna now, you marked me last night."" Ah, so that was the pain I felt last night.

I cracked my eyes to see my mate, Brandon, hovering next to me. ""Stay with me Amy.""

""No!"" I slammed out, putting all of my power in it.

Brandon looked down at me, pleading. ""Let me save you.""

""I am descended from the Moon Goddess, and you don't deserve to save me. You don't deserve our pup. You were weak. And now you lost everything."" I smiled up at him as I felt my life from my body.

Chapter Two

I opened my eyes to find myself surprisingly alive. ""Amy hurry, you're going to be late."" I jolted up and look around, confused. What was going on? Where was I? ""Amy!"" The voice called again and I shook myself. I stood up from the bed and looked around again. I recognized this room. It was my childhood bedroom.

I hadn't stepped foot in this room since I found my mate, Brandon. I heard a knock on the door and my mother opened it. Before I could process what was happening, I ran into my mother's arms. ""Mom, you're here."" I started to cry. ""I've missed you so much.""

""Amy. My girl."" She laughed as she patted my back. ""I saw you yesterday."" She pulled back and I looked into her amber eyes that matched my own. ""Happy birthday, baby.""

I leaned into her hands and realized that today was the last day I spent at home. I found my mate on my eighteenth birthday. ""Thank you, mom.""

""Hopefully, you will meet your mate today and start your new life."" She smiled at me and I felt my blood freeze. I didn't want to meet Brandon. Not when I knew what was going to happen.

""I'd rather stay here with you."" I smiled as I kissed her cheek. ""I don't want to miss you and Morgan.

And I knew that when Brandon thought I cheated on him, before he treated my baby and me like that. He also did the same to my mother for her involvement. Shannon's father, my mother's husband, watched her die.

""Baby. You won't miss us. We will be there every step of the way."" She kissed my cheek, and I wrapped my fingers around hers.

""Mom, can we just leave? You and me? Leave Shannon and Morgan and move back to daddy's pack?"" My father, the Alpha of the Silvermoon pack, wasn't a good husband, but he was a good man. He cheated on my mother, betraying her when he was drunk.

His betrayal cost the life of my brother growing inside of her, and she refused to move past it.

""No baby. I can't go back."" My mother's face fell as she turned away.

""I don't want to be betrayed, mom. Not like you and not any worse. I don't want a mate."" I whispered my new truth.

""What do you know?"" I watched as her eyes searched mine.

I pulled her back into my room and away from the door. ""I don't know for sure, but I am terrified that if I am mated to Shannon's boyfriend, I will die after we are mated. Mom, the chances that he will match with an Alpha far outweigh the chance that he is mated to the daughter of the beta."" I pulled back. ""I don't want this for me.""

She weighed my words, and I watched as she came to the same conclusion. ""Okay baby. But you can't leave. It would be too conspicuous. You will have to mask your scent whenever he is around.""

I tossed my hands in the air. ""How would I do that?""

""There is much you don't know that I would leave in the past but if you are sure..."" She trailed off and I just nodded my head. ""Then let me make a few calls. You don't have to go to school today.""

I lept back into her arms. ""Thank you, mom. I don't know what I would do without you.""

""I love you, baby. You will never be without me. That I can promise you."" She kissed my cheek and then left me alone in my room.

I ran to my phone and checked the date to make sure. It was twenty eighteen; I went back six years. Six years to the day that I met Brandon. I could relive everything, make better choices. I could live, and maybe this time around, so would my pup.

I went into my ensuite and jumped into the shower. No way was I going to face today, looking like I just crawled out of bed. I stood in side my closet in a towel trying to figure out what to wear when I heard my bedroom door open.

I was about to turn and call out to my mother, but I heard a soft step, which my mother wouldn't do. So I hid behind my winter coats and I waited.

""I'm telling you, if she is Brandon's mate, I'm going to destroy her.""

""You can't mean that, Shan."" The nasily voice of Megan, Shannon's best friend, came from the cell phone pressed to her ear.

""Of course I do. Brandon is mine.""

""Only because you put out. He was hoping Shannon would notice him.""

""You shut your mouth, Megan."" Shannon snarled and her eyes flashed. ""He's mine.""

""Whatever I gotta go,"" Megan called, and then the line went dead. A honk sounded from outside and Shannon was snatching something before I grabbed her hand.

""What do you think you're doing in my closet?""

""Amy?"" Shannon's mouth dropped out. I squeezed her hand until I heard a crack. Her scream was muffled by my hand.

""You're lucky I only broke one finger. You just threatened to destroy me. Didn't I hear that correctly? A beta's daughter threatening an alpha."" I tsked.

""I didn't do anything."" She snarled back at me as her hand reformed.

""Lie again and I will break all of your fingers and hold them while the bones heal."" I couldn't stop my grin as I felt her tremble. ""Did you threaten me?""

""Yes."" she screamed at me. ""You're going to take Brandon from me.""

""I don't want your pathetic alpha now or ever. Keep him."" I pushed her away. ""Now get out of my room before I change my mind about maiming you."" I turned back to my clothes and picked out low-rise jeans and a tank top.

""What is your problem?""

""You. Now leave."" I let my wolf come forward and my eyes flashed. I pushed my alpha command into my words and forcing her out of my room. Foolish girl. How dare she come into my room to take something of mine? My wolf growled lowly. This was our den. I shook myself and refocused. Closing the doors, I hopped back into bed, pulling out my phone. I tried to remember everything that happened in the last six years that could help me with my plan. Because make no mistake, Brandon and Shannon would pay.

Chapter Three

""Pack your bags, Amy."" My mom came in, surprising me from the list I was making.

""What?"" I looked up. ""Why?""

""You are going to spend the summer with your father. I already got the approval from the Alpha."" Mom smiled down at me. ""Come on, baby. Pack your bag and get ready.""

I jumped to my feet and ran to my mom. ""I can go?""

""Just for the summer, baby, then you will be back here with me. I had to promise that you would be returning here.""

I pouted. ""Mom, I really don't want to be here."" I wanted to make them pay, but I wouldn't risk him finding me.

""It's okay baby, you will understand once you see your dad."" She patted my hair and kissed my cheek. ""Now get ready.""

""Okay mom."" I kissed her back then she left me alone. I grabbed my phone to lock it and then turned back to my closet. I packed my bag and then headed into my bathroom when I heard the downstairs door slam open.

""I knew it."" I heard Shannon scream down stairs. I ignored her as I grabbed everything from my bathroom and then I grabbed my laptop and chargers. I stuffed everything in to my backpack and headed downstairs.

""Shannon, why are you screaming?"" Morgan was at the table with his coffee, and my mom was running around when I pushed my suitcase into the room.

""I'm not Brandon's mate, daddy."" Shannon flew into the room and dove into his arms.

""How are you so sure?"" Morgan wrapped his arms around her, but I just snickered. She snapped her eyes to me and she flew at me.

""It's you."" Shannon tried to claw out my eyes. But I just sent her flying with a backhand.

""Amy!"" Morgan got to his feet but my mom tsked.

""Morgan, you can't yell ay Amy for protecting herself. Shan attacked her first."" My mom placed my breakfast on the table. ""Amy, come eat. You have a long day ahead.""

""Babe? Why does Amy have a suitcase?""

""She is going away for the summer. To her fathers."" My mother turned to me and opened her arms. ""Come baby. Come eat. The car is coming and you need to be ready to go.""

I walked over and sat down, and dug in.

""Why is she going to her dads?"" Morgan walked over to pick Shannon up.

""She wanted to spend the summer with her dads before college and who am I to say no?"" My mom smiled down at me and I smiled back at her. I didn't know what was going to happen this summer to protect me from Brandon finding out I was his mate, but I needed it. Whatever it was, I needed it.

""Yeah, my dad called me this morning and since I haven't seen him since Christmas break and when he offered to fly me out, I asked my mom."" I smiled sweetly over at Morgan, and Shannon smiled.

""You're leaving?"" Shannon stood up.

""Yup. I'll be gone the full summer."" I smirked over at her. ""But my room is locked, and it will stay that way."" My smile dropped away as I stared at her and used my alpha command.

""Amy!"" Morgan yelled out. ""You know you're not allowed to alpha command your step sister!""

""And I wouldn't have Morgan, if I hdn't found her in my room this morning, trying to take things out of my closet."" I turned and raised my eyebrow, daring her to try to lie.

""Is that true?"" Morgan looked down at Shannon and I just stared at her. I watch her open her mouth to deny it.

""I wouldn't lie. I'll just command you to tell the truth."" She screeched and stomped her foot.

""Yes!"" she screamed. ""Are you happy? Yes, I went into her closet to steal some clothes because I know she is Brandon's mate.""

""How?"" I threw up my hands, playing like I didn't know the truth. ""How could you possibly know that I am his mate? Neither of us has scented each other.""

""Because he scented you on me!"" Her voice was hitting a higher octave, and my ears were starting to hurt.

""Calm down. You're hurting everyone's ears and just explain yourself."" My mom sat next to me at the table, rubbing her head.

""Last month, Brandon turned eighteen, and I was wearing Amy's dress. He scented around me and said I smelt divine. But when I'm not wearing her clothes, he has zero interest in me."" Shannon pouted.

""So he likes the way I smell, doesn't mean we are mates."" I pointed out. Completely and utterly denouncing Brandon as a mate. If I didn't accept him, he would never be my mate anyway, and I would never accept him. That was the only thing I was sure of.

Brandon would be the last male I would ever touch this time around.

""Stop being obtuse Amy. We all know what it means when a wolf likes your smell."" Shannon started to cry and buried her head in her hands. ""He's the male I want, daddy. The only one I would ever accept. But he wants her."" She pointed to me.

I scoffed. ""I don't want your sloppy seconds, Shannon. Even if he was my mate, and I am not saying he is. It would be a cold day before I accepted him as a mate. I would take the Lycan King over Brandon."" I threw my head back and laughed when she gasped.

The Lycan king was the bogeyman of all wolves.

The last Lycan to exist and one who lives in the wild. It's said the only wolves that ever see his face are the council that oversees the packs.

But either way, I wasn't lying. I would take the King as a mate before I would even look in Brandon's vicinity.

""You're lying. He's the alpha.""

""And?""

""Everyone wants to be the luna.""

""Idiots want to be the luna."" I turned back and finished my food as Morgan calmed her down. My mom stood when she heard a horn.

""That's for you.""

I nodded as I stood and kissed my mother goodbye before I left.

Chapter Four

I slipped into the back of the car after putting my bags in the back and buckled in. I had barely takin a breath before I launched myself over the seats and into the driver's arms.

His laugh made my eyes prickle. ""Hey love bug.""

""Uncle Ronnie. I've missed you."" I climbed over the seats and sat up front. ""What are you doing here?"" Ronnie was my dad's beta. Not related, but he had been there for most of my life.

""You think I was going to let my cheeky niece come to pack lands alone? Not on your life.""

""Dad sent you?"" I laughed.

""Dad sent me. He is a worry wart your da."" He smiled over and laughed with me. ""As soon as your mom called, he sent me with the jet.""

""He didn't have to."" I just shook my head and buckled my seatbelt.

""Of course he did. He never gets to see you enough, and now you're sending in the summer. What's going on?"" My uncle looked at me and I just shook my head.

""I don't want to be here.""

""Why?""

I looked down at my hands that were twisted. ""I'm afraid that my mate is here and I don't want to be right. I figured if I ran away, I could push off the inevitability.""

""Why wouldn; t you want your mate?"" My uncle asked as he zipped down the highway toward the airport.

""I'll tell both you and dad, just not now."" My uncle looked over at me, searching my face and then nodding.

""Fine, but I want the full story.""

""You will get it, I swear."" I nodded back to the road. ""Now focus on driving so you don't ruin us."" I grabbed the wheel, swerving back into our own lane.

""Heck!"" Uncle Ronnie grabbed the wheel from me and focused back on the road. ""I just worry about you, pup."" I couldn't stop the laugh because wolves stopped aging at twenty-five, and he looked barely older than me.

""I know you do."" I settled back into my seat and sighed. ""I promise, what happened isn't going to make that feeling any better."" I wiped at my face. ""I don't even know why my mom is sending me to my dad. She just said that he could help me.""

""Well, let's hurry and get back so we can figure out what you need, Sugar."" My uncle hit the gas, and we ended up at the airport in no time.

We loaded my bags and headed up to the jet, settling in there. ""Close your eyes. You look like you barely slept today and we have a few hours."" My uncle patted my head before he sat across from me and opened his laptop.

""Work?""

""Work."" He nodded.

""This summer, can you teach me some stuff?"" A plan was forming in my mind, a plan not only to keep myself away from my pathetic mate, but one that would make me a lot of money.

""Of course, Sugar."" My uncle smiled up at me. ""You know, your dad would teach you just about everything he could if you were open to it.""

""I asked to move to your pack."" I snuggled into the blanket the flight attendant handed me, and Ronnie froze.

""What is going on?"" His eyes flashed.

""I'll explain later. Just promise you will try to believe me and not judge me.""

""Of course, Sugar."" He smiled and then turned back to the laptop on his lap. ""Now get some sleep.""

""Will do."" I turned away and fell asleep almost instantly.

I woke up to Ronnie shaking me. ""We are here.""

I gave an enormous yawn and cracked my jaw before wiping my eyes. ""Okay."" I handed off the blanket and wiped my face again. ""Thank you.""

""No problem, Princess."" The flight attendant smiled down at me, and I realized belatedly that she was from the pack too.

""You don't have to call me Princess.""

""You are the Alpha's daughter."" She bowed and then left us to our own devices.

""Come on, your dad has already linked me three times since landing."" Ronnie laughed and whisked me off to the waiting car. With in thirty minutes we were at our pack lands. ""You dad would allow you to move here if you wanted to, Sugar.""

""I know. But Alpha Dan won't allow me to leave..."" I looked over and blew out a breath. ""I think he assumes something I am running from and won't let me leave until he knows for sure.""

""You going to tell me yet, Sugar.""

I hesitated as we pulled up out front of the pack house. Before I could answer the door was ripped open and I was surrounded by powerful arms and a smell that made my quaking insides settle.

""Dad.""

""Hey my pup."" His deep voice calmed me further, and I could feel my eyes prickle.

""I've missed you."" I sniffled as he unbuckled my seat belt and I was in his arms fully.

""As I have missed you."" He kissed my temple. ""Now we have much to discuss."" He was running with me before I could utter another word, with Ronnie following behind.

""Slow down, jack ass. Some of us can't move that fast."" Ronnie struggled to keep up and my laughter filled the halls of the pack house. We settled in my father's office with an out of breath Ronnie, who was scowling. God, I missed these two.

""Tell me what's wrong, pup."" I looked around and still I stumbled over my words. My father grabbed my face and shook his head. ""Nothing you tell me will change anything, pup. I believe you, no matter how crazy it seems.""

""Agreed Sugar.""

My insides settled when I saw how resolute he was. He would believe my craziness. I could tell no matter how crazy my story was, my father and Ronnie would believe everything I said.

I never had to second guess if I was going crazy here.

So finally I settled fully and told my story.

Chapter Five

""I lived another life, and I died."" I stumbled over my words and I felt my father freeze. A quick look to Ronnie had him locking the door and waving his hands. I felt the air still, but I was focused on my father's eyes. ""This morning I woke up six years in the past after living until I was twenty-four, and growing my own pup only to have my mate to rip him from my body.""

My father's and Ronnie's snarl shook the walls, but I raised my hands. ""He betrays me for my step sister who convinced him that I cheated and the pup wasn't his, so he brought death to us both using silver scalpels, and burying any love I had for him at the same time."" I looked up at my father and the tears rolled down my face.

""Pup."" His voice was choked up, but I raised my hand.

""I don't want him to be my mate, daddy. I know I won't survive it. I need to change it. Everything, and it starts with hiding my scent. I told mom what I needed, and she called you. How are you going to help me?"" I was starting to panic. ""I don't want to die. I don't want my pup ripped from my stomach only for him to smell himself on him. I don't want to create life just to have it ripped from me daddy. I can't."" My soul was ripping and even though I want revenge, this was the first time I was given to truly grieve the lost of my pup.

""Sugar."" Ronnie's voice was barely a whisper and then I felt my father lose control.

""Who?"" His voice was pure darkness. His fist slammed into the desk, creaking the thick wood, and I looked up to find my father's wolf looking back at me. ""Who hurt you, my pup? Who did those my grand pup?"" Loki's voice was deeper than I had ever heard and his eyes promised retribution.

""Brandon, the alpha's son."" I whispered the final piece and everything seemed to click. The air rushed back in and my father's wolf shifted into his black form. I screamed and Ronnie dove in front of the door.

Loki snarled, but Ronnie held firm. ""You can't go for him for something that hasn't come to pass yet, Loki. You know how this works. You have been through it yourself."" But Loki just snarled.

""Daddy, please."" I begged. I knew if he got out, Brandon and Shannon were dead and the council would be on his doorstop. Loki whirled on me and softened at the devastation he saw on my face. He padded over and licked the tears from my face before going back behind the desk and shifting again.

""I'm sorry Amy, I lost myself for a moment."" He opened a door and slipped into some shorts. He wiped at his face before he sat back down. ""I guess its our turn to come clean.""

""Daddy?"" I sniffled and looked up at him.

""I'm not just a wolf, although, as you can see, Loki is very much a part of me."" His laughter was weak, but I just smiled. ""My mother was a shaman of our people, a witch, and my father had to have her. Even if it was just for a night. And I was born.""

""A witch?"" I dropped my hands, and he just had a small, sad smile.

""Yeah. You would have loved her, but witches don't live like us. They have the lifespan of a human, a flash in the pan. She was gone long before I met your mother."" He shook his head. ""One of her powers was exactly what you explained, a second chance. The moon goddess passed us down with the same powers. I had mine when I was your age as well.""

I jolted back as he nodded. ""What?""

""I never cheated on your mother."" His words were soft. ""I alpha commanded a wolf to pretend I did when she came to me and told me she was with pup. You see, in my first life, I stayed with her and we had three wonderful pups, but one night, my enemies attacked and the four of your were all murdered."" His swallow was thick.

""Daddy.""

""I couldn't lose you, not all of my pups, so when I woke up four years in the past, I acted. You were just a babe. I never got your brothers or sister, which broke me for a time. But I had you."" He swallowed back his tears as I reached his side. ""I told your mother I betrayed her.""

""She said she felt it.""

He nodded slowly. ""When a wolf betrays their marked mate, the mate feels the worse pain imaginable.""

""Yes, he does."" Ronnie growled out and I darted my eyes back to his face and I realized something.

""Mom and Morgan.""

""It doesn't happen often enough to make it a big."" My dad growled out.

""But it happens enough that you feel the pain."" Ronnie growled out.

""Mom doesn't know."" I wrapped my arms around my father. ""She wouldn't ever if she knew.""

""I know, princess, but you can't tell her. I'm sure I passed the fate, since I made it past my death...but now, now it would break her to find out the truth."" My dad squeezed me.

""So she felt you take another female?"" I hugged him back, but he just shook his head.

""I used my power to fake the pain. She was crying inside of our room, and I was in the next room, breaking my own heart.""

""Daddy?""

""It was losing her and you, or losing everything. And I knew I would still get to see my little girl."" My dad pulled back. ""But anyway, I didn't tell you so you would feel bad for me, but to know that you have power too. Power to hide your scent, at the very least. But I will teach you how to wield it this summer.""

""Thank you, dad.""

""Don't thank me yet. This summer will probably be the worst you have ever had, but it will save you in the long run.""

""Once everything is done, I need you to promise me something, daddy.""

""What is it, pumpkin?"" My dad always called me new nicknames when he was worried.

""After I have done what I need to do, we are going to tell mom the truth.""

""Baby, we can't.""

""She is stronger than you think. And she never moved on. She only got with Morgan because she thought I needed a male's protection in the new pack. And she didn't like the attention she was getting from the Alpha.""

My dad growled and hit his desk again and then nodded. ""Fine. We will tell her.""

""Thank you, daddy."" I kissed his cheek.

""Now go get settled, we will start tomorrow morning, but I know a certain someone who is pounding down the pack house doors to try to see you.""

I smiled and shook my head. Cass was my best friend and soul sister. ""Cass?""

""Has been champing at the bit as soon as she heard you were coming, so go see her.""

""I love you two.""

""And we love you, sugar."" Ronnie kissed my head. ""I'd ruin your alpha mate if I could.""

""You would start a war."" I shook my head and left with a last hug from my dad.

Chapter Six

I walked to my room and screamed when I was tackled to the ground. I started laughing as Cassie got off me. ""Why the heck didn't you tell me you were coming?"" She punched my shoulder as I stood.

""I didn't know until this morning."" I hugged her to my side. ""I missed you.""

""I missed you too."" She pulled back and tossed me a small box. ""Happy birthday.""

I laughed again. ""With everything that has happened, I had pretty much forgotten that it's my birthday today.""

""The big eighteen. Have you shifted yet?"" Cassie jumped up and down with excitement.

I just shook my head. ""I don't shift. You know that."" My face fell. I heard chuffing inside of my head.

""I think you are just blocking it. You have a wolf. We all feel her."" She bumped her hip into mine. ""I can feel she wants out."" My wolf chuffed in agreement.

Cassie is smarter than you. My wolf's voice ricochetted in my mind and I just smiled. There are things I cannot tell you, even now, but eventually, if we are lucky, you will find out your answers.

I rolled my eyes. Yet another non answer from Nix, my wolf. She snorted back to me and then receded into the back of my mind.

""Nix still not answering you?""

""She is, but it's more of her non answers."" I grabbed my bag and opened it up. ""You will never guess what happened today.""

Cassie flopped on my bed. ""Tell me everything.""

I opened my mouth to tell her I lived before and my father's voice sounded in my mind. Baby girl, I know you might want to tell Cassie what happened with your first life, and I understand the need, but don't tell anyone yet. You can't seal their tongue and our heritage is dangerous.

Okay, dad. I won't.

I love you. Then his voice was gone and I had to reorganize my thoughts.

""Tell me."" Cassie threw a pillow at me and I shook my head.

""I think the alpha's son is my mate, and so does Shannon. She lost her ever loving mind, and was stealing my clothes so that he would pay attention to her."" I shook my head in disgust.

""She was trying to steal your mate?"" Cassie's eyes flashed.

""She can have him. I don't want or need her sloppy seconds. Even if she hadn't already did with him, which I am sure she has, I wouldn't have wanted him. He is mean and vindictive. And just...small.""

""Like small, small?"" Cassie held her finger and thumb close together and I bent over laughing, tears springing to my eyes as she joined in.

""I have no idea."" I wiped my eyes after I calmed down. ""Nor do I want to. I just mean even as an alpha, he gives off small man energy? I don't even know how to explain it exactly. Just that even when he is pushing his alpha aura, I feel nothing, not even a little bit, not even a fraction of what my dad does.""

I sat down on my bed. ""And you don't want to be with a mate that is weaker than you?""

""No, it's not that."" I shook my head. I wasn't explaining it right. ""I know that if given an excuse, he would betray me. His devotion would be weak, just like his aura.""

""Ah. Now I understand."" Cassie rolled on to her back and huffed. ""That would be the absolute worst thing. I don't know how your dad is taking the pain."" She took her eyes to me and grimaced.

""Did everyone here know the truth?""

Cassie shook her head. ""No, but once you guys left, and the Alpha never stayed with the she-wolf. With any she-wolf, we figured something was wrong, and then the wolf was born and we could all smell the girl's mate on the pup, and we knew they lied. We just don't know why."" Cassie rolled over. ""Do you know?""

I nodded. ""My dad told me the truth today when I told him I wanted to reject my mate.""

""Well, this is just depressing. Let's go out and do something?"" Cassie sat up and I just shook my head. ""C'mon.""

""I have training in the morning and my dad said it was going to be brutal.""

""So you can't go out today? Bull. Get up. We are going shopping and then I will parade you in front of everyone to make them jealous that my best friend is the Alpha's daughter.""

I perked up. ""Has anyone been giving you issues here?"" Cassie shook her head, but I could see someone had. ""Cass?""

She huffed and then nodded a little. ""Just a few she-wolves that think their sweat doesn't stink and have a higher rank."" Amanda and her little posse, I could only assume.

""Do they give you a lot of trouble?""

""Only a little."" She just grabbed my arm and pulled me to the door. ""Enough of them, I don't care. I just missed you, and I want to parade around with my best friend.""

""Okay."" I couldn't say no to her when I knew she was being bullied. Cassie was weaker than me, but then again, everyone was. But she was sweet and had been by my side since birth. Her mom and my mom used to be best friends. ""But you need to point out who is bullying you.""

""No way. I can handle it.""

""I know you can, but you shouldn't have to."" I could feel Nix coming closer to the surface. My anger was already rising.

""You aren't here enough."" Her whisper had me pulling her to a stop. ""I don't mean to make you feel bad, but you aren't here enough to start something with them for me. Because it will only get worse once you leave again."" She looked back at me with sad eyes. ""So, can we just drop it?""

I nodded my head but swore to myself that I would figure out this situation. ""Let's go have some fun. Parade me all you want. I'm here all summer."" I smiled and pushed the Amanda to the back of my mind. I would handle her as soon as I could.

1l8ycyk,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1l8ycyk/i_overslept_and_i_feel_like_an_idiot/,I overslept and I feel like an idiot.,"This isn’t as heavy as many of the things people share, but it’s weighing on me and I just needed to get it, well, off my chest.

I’m in my 30s and I slept through all of my alarms this morning, and didn’t wake up until 10:00 AM.

I’m a working professional in my mid 30s. I don’t generally stay up crazy-late, not do I usually sleep in very late. I had a little trouble falling asleep Monday night (also uncommon for me) and ended up lying in bed until about 1:00 AM, then woke up for my 6:30 alarm and snoozed it until 7:00. I got up, had my coffee, showered, and was at work by 9:00. I was dragging a little bit at the end of the day, and I told myself I’d get to bed early. I got in bed around 10:15 and I was definitely asleep by 11:00, if not before. 

Today, I know I woke up for my 6:30 alarm and snoozed it (I have a 7:00 AM alarm set as a backup because I know I snooze it a couple times as a way of easing myself awake). But I must have slept through both, because when I opened my eyes again it was 10:00 am. Luckily, my boss is out today and no one was any the wiser that I didn’t have a reason for showing up at 11:00 this morning. But I just feel like such an idiot. I felt like a teenager again, and not in the fun, youthful way but in the irresponsible way.

I imagined having to tell someone at work I slept through my alarm and it just seemed like such an embarrassing thing to admit. I’m a good employee, just got a great performance review, have good relationships with my colleagues, and always get my work done, so it’s not like I’m worried this is the cherry on top of some performance issue. But it just made me feel really immature.

Does this happen to other responsible adults? I’m single, if that matters—I don’t know if people rely on their partners nudging them and saying “your alarm went off.” Or am I just catastrophizing? I don’t know why this sent me into such a shame spiral, but it did.

Anyway, just screaming my insecurities into the Reddit void I guess. Happy hump day.",1,1749662153.0,offmychest,1,1.0,False

1l8ybvh,https://www.reddit.com/r/DID/comments/1l8ybvh/switching_on_purpose/,Switching on Purpose,"Hello. One of my Alters, Jacks, works mostly in the background. She rarely fronts and mostly helps with instruction when there is an emergency or we are in an unsafe place/situations. She’ll sometimes plan ahead and suggest rules or things we should avoid. I don’t know if I’d call her a protector - she doesn’t really take over or anything. 

We had a bad incident over the weekend where one alter was incredibly upset and could not calm down. 

Jacks suggested that the next time we are in this situation we should actively try to switch over to another, more cheerful/relaxed alter. She has been making a plan to bring some of that alters favorite things with us on our next social outing. Today, Jacks was running potential scenarios and then actively brought this Alter forward while we were out on a walk. 

That alter was confused and wound up breaking a glass bottle of coffee when she dropped it. 

I guess I think it seems weird. Like is this normal/healthy? It was just one incident… we can’t hide out and avoid any/everything that could be potentially triggering, but is switching on purpose the answer? Shouldn’t that other Alter that was upset learn how to calm down? Jacks thinks she can do that better if she is not fronting and can slip back into our headspace.

1l8ybln,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_waepa/comments/1l8ybln/fueling_yourself_for_the_hustle_healthy_eating/,Fueling Yourself for the Hustle: Healthy Eating Habits for Busy Professionals,"Racing from meeting to meeting, squeezing in workouts, juggling family responsibilities – as a busy professional, you’re constantly on the move. While your to-do list is carefully curated to make sure deadlines are met and kids are dropped off at activities at two different ends of town, it’s likely that you have not thought about what and when you’ll eat to fuel your day-to-day hustle.  

Maintaining healthy eating habits is important to sustain energy and health, and it does not have to add to your already full plate (pun intended). It’s easy to look for the quick fix for weight loss or energy boosts, but with a little up-front effort, healthy eating can be woven into your daily life providing the energy, strength, and mental clarity you need to show up fully every day.  

Let’s look at some sustainable, empowering healthy eating habits that are realistic for busy lives and avoid the pitfalls of diet culture. 

Read the full article on [waepa.org](http://waepa.org) \> 

# Culture of Health vs. Diet Culture 

Diet culture suggests that there’s something “wrong” with bodies that aren’t as small as possible. It actively promotes dieting as a way to “fix” yourself. This focus on thinness over well-being prioritizes restrictive eating and rigid food rules in ways that are not sustainable. Diet culture fuels a [$90 billion](https://blog.marketresearch.com/u.s.-weight-loss-industry-grows-to-90-billion-fueled-by-obesity-drugs-demand) weight loss industry focused on reducing weight as a measure of health. Diet culture approaches tend to: 

* Demonize entire food groups 
* Restrict calorie consumption at extreme levels 
* Promise rapid weight loss 
* Tie your worth to your appearance and weight 

Given that every body is different, many people have turned to body mass index (BMI) as the quantifiable measure of health. But [history shows](https://www.npr.org/2021/12/23/1067210075/what-if-the-best-diet-is-to-reject-diet-culture) that was not what BMI was designed to indicate.  

BMI was created by 19th-century Belgian, Adolphe Quetelet as a tool to assess weight distribution across populations. It was based on his idea of ""the ideal man,"" using a small sampling of the size and measurements of white, male Scottish and French soldiers.  

In the 1970s, a number of prominent American doctors adopted and rebranded Quetelet's index to offset the insurance companies setting arbitrary weight and mortality standards for insurance payments. 

Instead of adopting plans designed to get you to a certain weight or BMI, look for ways you can eat healthier food with an eye toward higher energy. See food as a fuel, not as something to be avoided. Find new ways to enjoy healthy food.

# Meal Planning and Prep  

Meal planning can feel daunting at first, but it can quickly become a habit that drives better eating. Each week, look at your schedule and take into account days you may have to work late, have sports practices, or other commitments throughout the day. Plan out healthy meals that work with your schedule. For example, tacos make a great grab and go meal for evenings when you are balancing multiple commitments with family members eating at different times. Save the high effort, multi-step meals for the weekend or evenings where you don’t have any commitments.  

With a week of meals plotted out, figure out what you can prepare in advance. For some this may mean chopping all vegetables for the week on Sunday afternoon. Batch cooking proteins like chicken or ground beef days in advance can also speed day-of cooking. Other prep can be done the evening before or in the morning. With items chopped and maybe even measured, cooking really becomes assembling at the end of a long day.  

If preparation feels overwhelming, consider a meal delivery service. All of the preparation is done for you, and you simply assemble the meal or even just heat it up.

# Make Room for Snacks 

In addition to planning your meals, become more thoughtful and prepared for snacking. Long gaps between meals can lead to low energy, poor concentration, and overeating later.  

Consider what nutritious snacks will satisfy your cravings throughout the day and keep them on hand: 

* Nuts and seeds: Packed with healthy fats, protein, and fiber they keep you full. 
* Greek yogurt: High in protein and probiotics, you can add fruits or honey for extra flavor. 
* Fruits: Apples, bananas, and berries can be pre-cut and portioned to make them easy to grab and go. 
* Whole grain crackers: Paired with hummus, nut butter, or cheese they are a balanced snack that includes carbs and protein.  
* Energy bars: Look for bars with whole ingredients, like oats, nuts, and dried fruits but watch out for added sugars.  
* Vegetable sticks: Carrot, cucumber, or bell pepper sticks with hummus are crunchy, satisfying, and full of nutrients.  
* Dark chocolate: Contains antioxidants and can boost mood by increasing serotonin levels. 

With a little prep and planning, snacking can be reinvented into a key tool to help you get through busy days. 

# Stay Hydrated 

Fatigue and brain fog are often symptoms of dehydration. Especially when you're busy, it’s easy to overlook drinking enough water. Instead of reaching for a coffee, keep a water bottle at your desk or in your bag. Set a goal for how much you want to drink each day to keep you feeling your best. If plain water feels boring, infuse it with slices of lemon, cucumber, or mint. Coffee has its place, but make sure caffeine isn’t replacing hydration or proper meals.

# Healthy Eating is a Balance 

There will be days when you grab a drive-thru sandwich between meetings or skip a homemade lunch because of a last-minute project. That’s okay. Healthy eating isn't about perfection — it's about making supportive choices more often than not. 

Give yourself grace. Trust that small, consistent efforts — like eating a nourishing breakfast, packing a balanced snack, or simply drinking enough water — add up over time. 

By focusing on fueling your body rather than fixing it, you’ll cultivate habits that sustain your health, support your energy, and fit naturally into your busy, dynamic life.

I haven't set a goal weight because 1) as soon as I get close to hitting my goal, I give up and start slowly gaining it back and 2) now that I've had kids, weight has settled on me differently so I'm no longer obsessed with the number as long as I look good. 

Instead of a numeric goal, I've started habit stacking. Last August, I wanted to start walking 10k steps during the week days. I got a walking pad and have been able to consistently get 12-14k 5 days a week. This January, I started tracking my calories every day on LoseIt. In March, I cut down on drinking my calories (no creamer in my coffee and limiting alcohol to one -two drinks a week) and increasing my water intake. Now, I'm looking for another habit to stack on! I was thinking of trying lifting again but I'm so intimidated by it! I tried it a couple years ago with a personal trainer and while I got strong af in those 9 months, my curvy frame got super boxy looking lol. Even my trainer was confused! What are your favorite healthy habits that have helped with weight loss or leading a healthier life??",0,1749661956.0,WeightLossAdvice,0,0.5,False

1l8y90l,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1l8y90l/my_goto_homemade_vanilla_honey_cortado_recipe/,My go-to homemade vanilla honey cortado recipe,"I've been perfecting this recipe for months and finally feel confident enough to share it with you all. This is hands down my favorite afternoon pick-me-up when I want something a little fancy but don't want to leave the house.



What you'll need:

2 shots of espresso (or really strong coffee if you don't have an espresso machine)

2 oz warm whole milk (I've tried oat milk too and it's amazing!)

1 tsp good quality honey

1/4 tsp vanilla extract

Pinch of sea salt (trust me on this one!)



How to make it:

Pull your espresso shots into a 4-6 oz glass or cup

While the espresso is brewing, gently warm your milk - don't boil it! Just until it's steamy

Stir the honey and vanilla into the warm milk until completely dissolved

Pour the milk mixture over your espresso, leaving a little foam on top if you frothed it

Add that tiny pinch of sea salt on top - it really brings out the sweetness!



The ratio is key here - you want equal parts espresso and milk, which gives you that perfect cortado balance. Not too milky like a latte, but smoother than straight espresso.

Here's a question tho, I used my outin portable espresso machine to get the espresso shot and used a mini blender thing to froth the milk. What do you guys use? Is there any popular choice?",1,1749661903.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

The boundaries of our country, sir? Why sir, on the north we are bounded by the Aurora Borealis, on the east we are bounded by the rising sun, on the south we are bounded by the procession of the Equinoxes, and on the west by the Day of Judgment. The American Joe Miller’s Jest Book  
Shadow had done three years in prison. He was big enough and looked don’t-fuck-with-me enough that his biggest problem was killing time. So he kept himself in shape, and taught himself coin tricks, and thought a lot about how much he loved his wife.  The best thing—in Shadow’s opinion, perhaps the only good thing—about being in prison was a feeling of relief. The feeling that he’d plunged as low as he could plunge and he’d hit bottom. He didn’t worry that the man was going to get him, because the man had got him. He was no longer scared of what tomorrow might bring, because yesterday had brought it.  It did not matter, Shadow decided, if you had done what you had been convicted of or not. In his experience everyone he met in prison was aggrieved about something: there was always something the authorities had got wrong, something they said you did when you didn’t—or you didn’t do quite like they said you did. What was important was that they had gotten you.  He had noticed it in the first few days, when everything, from the slang to the bad food, was new. Despite the misery and the utter skin-crawling horror of incarceration, he was breathing relief.  
Shadow tried not to talk too much. Somewhere around the middle of year two he mentioned his theory to Low Key Lyesmith, his cellmate.  Low Key, who was a grifter from Minnesota, smiled his scarred smile. “Yeah,” he said. “That’s true. It’s even better when you’ve been sentenced to death. That’s when you remember the jokes about the guys who kicked their boots off as the noose flipped around their necks, because their friends always told them they’d die with their boots on.”  
“Is that a joke?” asked Shadow. Damn right. Gallows humor. Best kind there is. When did they last hang a man in this state?” asked Shadow. How the hell should I know?” Lyesmith kept his orange-blond hair pretty much shaved. You could see the lines of his skull. “Tell you what, though. This country started going to hell when they stopped hanging folks. No gallows dirt. No gallows deals.”  
  Shadow shrugged. He could see nothing romantic in a death sentence.  
  
  If you didn’t have a death sentence, he decided, then prison was, at best, only a temporary reprieve from life, for two reasons. First, life creeps back into prison. There are always places to go further down. Life goes on. And second, if you just hang in there, someday they’re going to have to let you out.  
  
  In the beginning it was too far away for Shadow to focus on. Then it became a distant beam of hope, and he learned how to tell himself “this too shall pass” when the prison shit went down, as prison shit always did. One day the magic door would open and he’d walk through it. So he marked off the days on his Songbirds of North America calendar, which was the only calendar they sold in the prison commissary, and the sun went down and he didn’t see it and the sun came up and he didn’t see it. He practiced coin tricks from a book he found in the wasteland of the prison library; and he worked out; and he made lists in his head of what he’d do when he got out of prison.  
  
  Shadow’s lists got shorter and shorter. After two years he had it down to three things.  
  
  First, he was going to take a bath. A real, long, serious soak, in a tub with bubbles. Maybe read the paper, maybe not. Some days he thought one way, some days the other.  
  
  Second he was going to towel himself off, put on a robe. Maybe slippers. He liked the idea of slippers. If he smoked he would be smoking a pipe about now, but he didn’t smoke. He would pick up his wife in his arms (“Puppy,” she would squeal in mock horror and real delight, “what are you doing?”). He would carry her into the bedroom, and close the door. They’d call out for pizzas if they got hungry.  
  
  Third, after he and Laura had come out of the bedroom, maybe a couple of days later, he was going to keep his head down and stay out of trouble for the rest of his life.  
  
  “And then you’ll be happy?” asked Low Key Lyesmith. That day they were working in the prison shop, assembling bird feeders, which was barely more interesting than stamping out license plates.  
  
  “Call no man happy,” said Shadow, “until he is dead.”  
  
  “Herodotus,” said Low Key. “Hey. You’re learning.”  
  
  “Who the fuck’s Herodotus?” asked the Iceman, slottin  
g together the sides of a bird feeder and passing it to Shadow, who bolted and screwed it tight.  
  
  “Dead Greek,” said Shadow.  
  
  “My last girlfriend was Greek,” said the Iceman. “The shit her family ate. You would not believe. Like rice wrapped in leaves. Shit like that.”  
  
  The Iceman was the same size and shape as a Coke machine, with blue eyes and hair so blond it was almost white. He had beaten the crap out of some guy who had made the mistake of copping a feel off his girlfriend in the bar where she danced and the Iceman bounced. The guy’s friends had called the police, who arrested the Iceman and ran a check on him which revealed that the Iceman had walked from a work-release program eighteen months earlier.  
  
  “So what was I supposed to do?” asked the Iceman, aggrieved, when he had told Shadow the whole sad tale. “I’d told him she was my girlfriend. Was I supposed to let him disrespect me like that? Was I? I mean, he had his hands all over her.”  
  
  Keep your head down. Do your own time. Shadow had said, “You tell ’em,” and left it at that. One thing he had learned early, you do your own time in prison. You don’t do anyone else’s time for them.  
  
  Lyesmith had loaned Shadow a battered paperback copy of Herodotus’s Histories several months earlier. “It’s not boring. It’s cool,” he said, when Shadow protested that he didn’t read books. “Read it first, then tell me it’s cool.”  
  
  Shadow had made a face, but he had started to read, and had found himself hooked against his will.  
  
  “Greeks,” said the Iceman, with disgust. “And it ain’t true what they say about them, neither. I tried giving it to my girlfriend in the ass, she almost clawed my eyes out.”  
  
  Lyesmith was transferred one day, without warning. He left Shadow his copy of Herodotus. There was a nickel hidden in the pages. Coins were contraband: you can sharpen the edges against a stone, slice open someone’s face in a fight. Shadow didn’t want a weapon; Shadow just wanted something to do with his hands.  
  
  Shadow was not superstitious. He did not believe in anything he could not see. Still, he could feel disaster hovering above the prison in those final weeks, just as he had felt it in the days before the robbery. There was a hollowness in the pit of his stomach that he told himself was simply a fear of going back to the world on the outside. But he could not be sure. He was more paranoid than usual, and in prison usual is very, and is a survival skill. Shadow became more quiet, more shadowy, than ever. He found himself watching the body language of the guards, of the other inmates, searching for a clue to the bad thing that was going to happen, as he was certain that it would.  
  
  A month before he was due to be released. Shadow sat in a chilly office, facing a short man with a port-wine birthmark on his forehead. They sat across a desk from each other; the man had Shadow’s file open in front of him, and was holding a ballpoint pen. The end of the pen was badly chewed.  
  
  “You cold, Shadow?”  
  
  “Yes,” said Shadow. “A little.”  
  
  The man shrugged. “That’s the system,” he said. “Furnaces don’t go on until December the first. Then they go off March the first. I don’t make the rules.” He ran his forefinger down the sheet of paper stapled to the inside left of the folder. “You’re thirty-two years old?”  
  
  “Yes, sir.”  
  
  “You look younger.”  
  
  “Clean living.”  
  
  “Says here you’ve been a model inmate.”  
  
  “I learned my lesson, sir.”  
  
  “Did you really?” He looked at Shadow intently, the birthmark on his forehead lowering. Shadow thought about telling the man some of his theories about prison, but he said nothing. He nodded, instead, and concentrated on appearing properly remorseful.  
  
  “Says here you’ve got a wife, Shadow.”  
  
  “Her name’s Laura.”  
  
  “How’s everything there?”  
  
  “Pretty good. She’s come down to see me as much as she could—it’s a long way to travel. We write and I call her when I can.”  
  
  “What does your wife do?”  
  
  “She’s a travel agent. Sends people all over the world.”  
  
  “How’d you meet her?”  
  
  Shadow could not decide why the man was asking. He considered telling him it was none of his business, then said, “She was my best buddy’s wife’s best friend. They set us up on a blind date. We hit it off.”  
  
  “And you’ve got a job waiting for you?”  
  
  “Yessir. My buddy, Robbie, the one I just told you about, he owns the Muscle Farm, the place I used to train. He says my old job is waiting for me.”  
  
  An eyebrow raised. “Really?”  
  
  “Says he figures I’ll be a big draw. Bring back some old-timers, and pull in the tough crowd who want to be tougher.”  
  
  The man seemed satisfied. He chewed the end of his ballpoint pen, then turned over the sheet of paper.  
  
  “How do you feel about your offense?”  
  
  Shadow shrugged. “I was stupid,” he said, and meant it.  
  
  The man with the birthmark sighed. He ticked off a number of items on a checklist. Then he riffled through the papers in Shadow’s file. “How’re you getting home from here?” he asked. “Greyhound?”  
  
  “Flying home. It’s good to have a wife who’s a travel agent.”  
  
  The man frowned, and the birthmark creased. “She sent you a ticket?”  
  
  “Didn’t need to. Just sent me a confirmation number. Electronic ticket. All I have to do is turn up at the airport in a month and show ’em my ID, and I’m outta here.”  
  
  The man nodded, scribbled one final note, then he closed the file and put down the ballpoint pen. Two pale hands rested on the gray desk like pink animals. He brought his hands close together, made a steeple of his forefingers, and stared at Shadow with watery hazel eyes.  
  
  “You’re lucky,” he said. “You have someone to go back to, you got a job waiting. You can put all this behind you. You got a second chance. Make the most of it.”  
  
  The man did not offer to shake Shadow’s hand as he rose to leave, nor did Shadow expect him to.  
  
  The last week was the worst. In some ways it was worse than the whole three years put together. Shadow wondered if it was the weather: oppressive, still, and cold. It felt as if a storm was on the way, but the storm never came. He had the jitters and the heebie-jeebies, a feeling deep in his stomach that something was entirely wrong. In the exercise yard the wind gusted. Shadow imagined that he could smell snow on the air.  
  
  He called his wife collect. Shadow knew that the phone companies whacked a three-dollar surcharge on every call made from a prison phone. That was why operators are always real polite to people calling from prisons, Shadow had decided: they knew that he paid their wages.  
  
  “Something feels weird,” he told Laura. That wasn’t the first thing he said to her. The first thing was “I love you,” because it’s a good thing to say if you can mean it, and Shadow did.  
  
  “Hello,” said Laura. “I love you too. What feels weird?”  
  
  “I don’t know,” he said. “Maybe the weather. It feels like if we could only get a storm, everything would be okay.”  
  
  “It’s nice here,” she said. “The last of the leaves haven’t quite fallen. If we don’t get a storm, you’ll be able to see them when you get home.”  
  
  “Five days,” said Shadow.  
  
  “A hundred and twenty hours, and then you come home,” she said.  
  
  “Everything okay there? Nothing wrong?”  
  
  “Everything’s fine. I’m seeing Robbie tonight. We’re planning your surprise welcome-home party.”  
  
  “Surprise party?”  
  
  “Of course. You don’t know anything about it, do you?”  
  
  “Not a thing.”  
  
  “That’s my husband,” she said. Shadow realized that he was smiling. He had been inside for three years, but she could still make him smile.  
  
  “Love you, babes,” said Shadow.  
  
  “Love you, puppy,” said Laura.  
  
  Shadow put down the phone.  
  
  When they got married Laura told Shado  
w that she wanted a puppy, but their landlord had pointed out they weren’t allowed pets under the terms of their lease. “Hey,” Shadow had said, “I’ll be your puppy. What do you want me to do? Chew your slippers? Piss on the kitchen floor? Lick your nose? Sniff your crotch? I bet there’s nothing a puppy can do I can’t do!” And he picked her up as if she weighed nothing at all and began to lick her nose while she giggled and shrieked, and then he carried her to the bed.  
  
  In the food hall Sam Fetisher sidled over to Shadow and smiled, showing his old teeth. He sat down beside Shadow and began to eat his macaroni and cheese.  
  
  “We got to talk,” said Sam Fetisher.  
  
  Sam Fetisher was one of the blackest men that Shadow had ever seen. He might have been sixty. He might have been eighty. Then again, Shadow had met thirty-year-old crackheads who looked older than Sam Fetisher.  
  
  “Mm?” said Shadow.  
  
  “Storm’s on the way,” said Sam.  
  
  “Feels like it,” said Shadow. “Maybe it’ll snow soon.”  
  
  “Not that kind of storm. Bigger storm than that coming. I tell you, boy, you’re better off in here than out on the street when the big storm comes.”  
  
  “Done my time,” said Shadow. “Friday, I’m gone.”  
  
  Sam Fetisher stared at Shadow. “Where you from?” he asked.  
  
  “Eagle Point. Indiana.”  
  
  “You’re a lying fuck,” said Sam Fetisher. “I mean originally. Where are your folks from?”  
  
  “Chicago,” said Shadow. His mother had lived in Chicago as a girl, and she had died there, half a lifetime ago.  
  
  “Like I said. Big storm coming. Keep your head down, Shadow-boy. It’s like . . . what do they call those things continents ride around on? Some kind of plates?”

  “Tectonic plates?” Shadow hazarded.  
  
  “That’s it. Tectonic plates. It’s like when they go riding, when North America goes skidding into South America, you don’t want to be in the middle. You dig me?”  
  
  “Not even a little.”  
  
  One brown eye closed in a slow wink. “Hell, don’t say I didn’t warn you,” said Sam Fetisher, and he spooned a trembling lump of orange Jell-O into his mouth.  
  
  “I won’t.”  
  
  Shadow spent the night half-awake, drifting in and out of sleep, listening to his new cellmate grunt and snore in the bunk below him. Several cells away a man whined and howled and sobbed like an animal, and from time to time someone would scream at him to shut the fuck up. Shadow tried not to hear. He let the empty minutes wash over him, lonely and slow.  
  
  Two days to go. Forty-eight hours, starting with oatmeal and prison coffee, and a guard named Wilson who tapped Shadow harder than he had to on the shoulder and said, “Shadow? This way.”  
  
  Shadow checked his conscience. It was quiet, which did not, he had observed, in a prison, mean that he was not in deep shit. The two men walked more or less side by side, feet echoing on metal and concrete.  
  
  Shadow tasted fear in the back of his throat, bitter as old coffee. The bad thing was happening. . . .  
  
  There was a voice in the back of his head whispering that they were going to slap another year onto his sentence, drop him into solitary, cut off his hands, cut off his head. He told himself he was being stupid, but his heart was pounding fit to burst out of his chest.  
  
  “I don’t get you, Shadow,” said Wilson, as they walked.  
  
  “What’s not to get, sir?”  
  
  “You. You’re too fucking quiet. Too polite. You wait like the old guys, but you’re what? Twenty-five? Twenty-eight?”  
  
  “Thirty-two, sir.”  
  
  “And what are you? A spic? A gypsy?”  
  
  “Not that I know of, sir. Maybe.”  
  
  “Maybe you got nigger blood in you. You got nigger blood in you, Shadow?”  
  
  “Could be, sir.” Shadow stood tall and looked straight ahead, and concentrated on not allowing himself to be riled by this man.  
  
  “Yeah? Well, all I know is, you fucking spook me.” Wilson had sandy blond hair and a sandy blond face and a sandy blond smile. “You leaving us soon.”  
  
  “Hope so, sir.”  
  
  They walked through a couple of checkpoints. Wilson showed his ID each time. Up a set of stairs, and they were standing outside the prison warden’s office. It had the prison warden’s name—G. Patterson—on the door in black letters, and beside the door, a miniature traffic light.  
  
  The top light burned red.  
  
  Wilson pressed a button below the traffic light.  
  
  They stood there in silence for a couple of minutes. Shadow tried to tell himself that everything was all right, that on Friday morning he’d be on the plane up to Eagle Point, but he did not believe it himself.  
  
  The red light went out and the green light went on, and Wilson opened the door. They went inside.  
  
  Shadow had seen the warden a handful of times in the last three years. Once he had been showing a politician around. Once, during a lockdown, the warden had spoken to them in groups of a hundred, telling them that the prison was overcrowded, and that, since it would remain overcrowded, they had better get used to it.  
  
  Up close, Patterson looked worse. His face was oblong, with gray hair cut into a military bristle cut. He smelled of Old Spice. Behind him was a shelf of books, each with the word Prison in the title; his desk was perfectly clean, empty but for a telephone and a tear-off-the-pages Far Side calendar. He had a hearing aid in his right ear.  
  
  “Please, sit down.”  
  
  Shadow sat down. Wilson stood behind him.  
  
  The warden opened a desk drawer and took out a file, placed it on his desk.  
  
  “Says here you were sentenced to six years for aggravated assault and battery. You’ve served three years. You were due to be released on Friday.”  
  
  Were? Shadow felt his stomach lurch inside him. He wondered how much longer he was going to have to serve—another year? Two years? All three? All he said was “Yes, sir.”  
  
  The warden licked his lips. “What did you say?”  
  
  “I said, ‘Yes, sir.’ “  
  
  “Shadow, we’re going to be releasing you later this afternoon. You’ll be getting out a couple of days early.” Shadow nodded, and he waited for the other shoe to drop. The warden looked down at the paper on his desk. “This came from the Johnson Memorial Hospital in Eagle Point . . . Your wife. She died in the early hours of this morning. It was an automobile accident. I’m sorry.”  
  
  Shadow nodded once more.  
  
  Wilson walked him back to his cell, not saying anything. He unlocked the cell door and let Shadow in. Then he said, “It’s like one of them good news, bad news jokes, isn’t it? Good news, we’re letting you out early, bad news, your wife is dead.” He laughed, as if it were genuinely funny.  
  
  Shadow said nothing at all.  
  
  Numbly, he packed up his possessions, gave most of them away. He left behind Low Key’s Herodotus and the book of coin tricks, and, with a momentary pang, he abandoned the blank metal disks he had smuggled out of the workshop, which had served him for coins. There would be coins, real coins, on the outside. He shaved. He dressed in civilian clothes. He walked through door after door, knowing that he would never walk back through them again, feeling empty inside.  
  
  The rain had started to gust from the gray sky, a freezing rain. Pellets of ice stung Shadow’s face, while the rain soaked the thin overcoat and they walked toward the yellow ex–school bus that would take them to the nearest city.  
  
  By the time they got to the bus they were soaked. Eight of them were leaving. Fifteen hundred still inside. Shadow sat on the bus and shivered until the heaters started working, wondering what he was doing, where he would go now.  
  
  Ghost images filled his head, unbidden. In his imagination he was leaving another prison, long ago.  
  
  He had been imprisoned in a lightless room for far too long: his beard was wild and his hair was a tangle. The guards had walked him down a gray stone stairway and out into a plaza filled with brightly colored things, with people and with objects. It was a market day and he was dazzled by the noise and the color, squinting at the sunlight that filled the square, smelling the salt-wet air and all the good things of the market, and on his left the sun glittered from the water . . .  
  
  The bus shuddered to a halt at a red light.  
  
  The wind howled about the bus, and the wipers slooshed heavily back and forth across the windshield, smearing the city into a red and yellow neon wetness. It was early afternoon, but it looked like night through the glass.  
  
  “Shit,” said the man in the seat behind Shadow, rubbing the condensation from the window with his hand, staring at a wet figure hurrying down the sidewalk. “There’s pussy out there.”  
  
  Shadow swallowed. It occurred to him that he had not cried yet—had in fact felt nothing at all. No tears. No sorrow. Nothing.  
  
  He found himself thinking about a guy named Johnnie Larch he’d shared a cell with when he’d first been put inside, who told Shadow how he’d once got out after five years behind bars with one hundred dollars and a ticket to Seattle, where his sister lived.  
  
  Johnnie Larch had got to the airport, and he handed his ticket to the woman on the counter, and she asked to see his driver’s license.  
  
  He showed it to her. It had expired a couple of years earlier. She told him it was not valid as ID. He told her it might not be valid as a driver’s license, but it sure as hell was fine identification, and damn it, who else did she think he was, if he wasn’t him?  
  
  She said she’d thank him to keep his voice down.  
  
  He told her to give him a fucking boarding pass, or she was going to regret it, and that he wasn’t going to be disrespected. You don’t let people disrespect you in prison.  
  
  Then she pressed a button, and few moments later the airport security showed up, and they tried to pe  
rsuade Johnnie Larch to leave the airport quietly, and he did not wish to leave, and there was something of an altercation.  
  
  The upshot of it all was that Johnnie Larch never actually made it to Seattle, and he spent the next couple of days in town in bars, and when his one hundred dollars was gone he held up a gas station with a toy gun for money to keep drinking, and the police finally picked him up for pissing in the street. Pretty soon he was back inside serving the rest of his sentence and a little extra for the gas station job.  
  
  And the moral of this story, according to Johnnie Larch, was this: don’t piss off people who work in airports.  
  
  “Are you sure it’s not something like ‘The kind of behavior that works in a specialized environment, such as prison, can fail to work and in fact become harmful when used outside such an environment’?” said Shadow, when Johnnie Larch told him the story.  
  
  “No, listen to me, I’m telling you, man,” said Johnnie Larch, “don’t piss off those bitches in airports.”  
  
  Shadow half smiled at the memory. His own driver’s license had several months still to go before it expired.  
  
  “Bus station! Everybody out!”  
  
  The building stank of piss and sour beer. Shadow climbed into a taxi and told the driver to take him to the airport. He told him that there was an extra five dollars if he could do it in silence. They made it in twenty minutes and the driver never said a word.  
  
  Then Shadow was stumbling through the brightly lit airport terminal. Shadow worried about the whole e-ticket business. He knew he had a ticket for a flight on Friday, but he didn’t know if it would work today. Anything electronic seemed fundamentally magical to Shadow, and liable to evaporate at any moment.  
  
  Still, he had his wallet, back in his possession for the first time in three years, containing several expired credit cards and one Visa card, which, he was pleasantly surprised to discover, didn’t expire until the end of January. He had a reservation number. And, he realized, he had the certainty that once he got home everything would, somehow, be okay. Laura would be fine again. Maybe it was some kind of scam to spring him a few days early. Or perhaps it was a simple mix-up: some other Laura Moon’s body had been dragged from the highway wreckage.  
  
  Lightning flickered outside the airport, through the windows-walls. Shadow realized he was holding his breath, waiting for something. A distant boom of thunder. He exhaled.  
  
  A tired white woman stared at him from behind the counter.  
  
  “Hello,” said Shadow. You’re the first strange woman I’ve spoken to, in the flesh, in three years. “I’ve got an e-ticket number. I was supposed to be traveling on Friday but I have to go today. There was a death in my family.”  
  
  “Mm. I’m sorry to hear that.” She tapped at the keyboard, stared at the screen, tapped again. “No problem. I’ve put you on the three-thirty. It may be delayed because of the storm, so keep an eye on the screens. Checking any baggage?”  
  
  He held up a shoulder bag. “I don’t need to check this, do I?”  
  
  “No,” she said. “It’s fine. Do you have any picture ID?”  
  
  Shadow showed her his driver’s license.  
  
  It was not a big airport, but the number of people wandering, just wandering, amazed him. He watched people put down bags casually, observed wallets stuffed into back pockets, saw purses put down, unwatched, under chairs. That was when he realized he was no longer in prison.  
  
  Thirty minutes to wait until boarding. Shadow bought a slice of pizza and burned his lip on the hot cheese. He took his change and went to the phones. Called Robbie at the Muscle Farm, but the machine picked up.  
  
  “Hey Robbie,” said Shadow. “They tell me that Laura’s dead. They let me out early. I’m coming home.”  
  
  Then, because people do make mistakes, he’d seen it happen, he called home, and listened to Laura’s voice.  
  
  “Hi,” she said. “I’m not here or I can’t come to the phone. Leave a message and I’ll get back to you. And have a good day.”  
  
  Shadow couldn’t bring himself to leave a message.  
  
  He sat in a plastic chair by the gate, and held his bag so tight he hurt his hand.  
  
  He was thinking about the first time he had ever seen Laura. He hadn’t even known her name then. She was Audrey Burton’s friend. He had been sitting with Robbie in a booth at Chi-Chi’s when Laura had walked in a pace or so behind Audrey, and Shadow had found himself staring. She had long, chestnut hair and eyes so blue Shadow mistakenly thought she was wearing tinted contact lenses. She had ordered a strawberry daiquiri, and insisted that Shadow taste it, and laughed delightedly when he did.  
  
  Laura loved people to taste what she tasted.  
  
  He had kissed her good night that night, and she had tasted like strawberry daiquiris, and he had never wanted to kiss anyone else again.  
  
  A woman announced that his plane was boarding, and Shadow’s row was the first to be called. He was in the very back, an empty seat beside him. The rain pattered continually against the side of the plane: he imagined small children tossing down dried peas by the handful from the skies.  
  
  As the plane took off he fell asleep.  
  
  Shadow was in a dark place, and the thing staring at him wore a buffalo’s head, rank and furry with huge wet eyes. Its body was a man’s body, oiled and slick.  
  
  “Changes are coming,” said the buffalo without moving its lips. “There are certain decisions that will have to be made.”  
  
  Firelight flickered from wet cave walls.  
  
  “Where am I?” Shadow asked.  
  
  “In the earth and under the earth,” said the buffalo man. “You are where the forgotten wait.” His eyes were liquid black marbles, and his voice was a rumble from beneath the world. He smelled like wet cow. “Believe,” said the rumbling voice. “If you are to survive, you must believe.”  
  
  “Believe what?” asked Shadow. “What should I believe?”  
  
  He stared at Shadow, the buffalo man, and he drew himself up huge, and his eyes filled with fire. He opened his spit-flecked buffalo mouth and it was red inside with the flames that burned inside him, under the earth.  
  
  “Everything,” roared the buffalo man.  
  
  The world tipped and spun, and Shadow was on the plane once more; but the tipping continued. In the front of the plane a woman screamed halfheartedly.  
  
  Lightning burst in blinding flashes around the plane. The captain came on the intercom to tell them that he was going to try and gain some altitude, to get away from the storm.  
  
  The plane shook and shuddered, and Shadow wondered, coldly and idly, if he was going to die. It seemed possible, he decided, but unlikely. He stared out of the window and watched the lightning illuminate the horizon.  
  
  Then he dozed once more, and dreamed he was back in prison and that Low Key had whispered to him in the food line that someone had put out a contract on his life, but that Shadow could not find out who or why; and when he woke up they were coming in for a landing.  
  
  He stumbled off the plane, blinking into wakefulness.  
  
  All airports, he thought, look very much the same. It doesn’t actually matter where you are, you are in an airport: tiles and walkways and restrooms, gates and newsstands and fluorescent lights. This airport looked like an airport. The trouble is, this wasn’t the airport he was going to. This was a big airport, with way too many people, and way too many gates.  
  
  “Excuse me, ma’am?”  
  
  The woman looked at him over the clipboard. “Yes?”  
  
  “What airport is this?”  
  
  She looked at him, puzzled, trying to decide whether or not he was joking, then she said, “St. Louis.”  
  
  “I thought this was the plane to Eagle Point.”  
  
  “It was. They redirected it here because of the storms. Didn’t they make an announcement?”  
  
  “Probably. I fell asleep.”  
  
  “You’ll need to talk to that man over there, in the red coat.”  
  
  The man was almost as tall as Shadow: he looked like the father from a seventies sitcom, and he tapped something into a computer and told Shad  
ow to run—run!—to a gate on the far side of the terminal.  
  
  Shadow ran through the airport, but the doors were already closed when he got to the gate. He watched the plane pull away from the gate, through the plate glass.  
  
  The woman at the passenger assistance desk (short and brown, with a mole on the side of her nose) consulted with another woman and made a phone call (“Nope, that one’s out. They’ve just cancelled it.”) then she printed out another boarding card. “This will get you there,” she told him. “We’ll call ahead to the gate and tell them you’re coming.”  
  
  Shadow felt like a pea being flicked between three cups, or a card being shuffled through a deck. Again he ran through the airport, ending up near where he had gotten off originally.  
  
  A small man at the gate took his boarding pass. “We’ve been waiting for you,” he confided, tearing off the stub of the boarding pass, with Shadow’s seat assignment—17D—on it. Shadow hurried onto the plane, and they closed the door behind him.  
  
  He walked through first class—there were only four first-class seats, three of which were occupied. The bearded man in a pale suit seated next to the unoccupied seat at the very front grinned at Shadow as he got onto the plane, then raised his wrist and tapped his watch as Shadow walked past.  
  
  Yeah, yeah, I’m making you late, thought Shadow. Let that be the worst of your worries.  
  
  The plane seemed pretty full, as he made his way down toward the back. Actually, Shadow found, it was completely full, and there was a middle-aged woman sitting in seat 17D. Shadow showed her his boarding card stub, and she showed him hers: they matched.  
  
  “Can you take your seat, please?” asked the flight attendant.  
  
  “No,” he said, “I’m afraid I can’t.”  
  
  She clicked her tongue and checked their boarding cards, then she led him back up to the front of the plane and pointed him to the empty seat in first class. “Looks like it’s your lucky day,” she told him. “Can I bring you something to drink? We’ll just have time before we take off. And I’m sure you need one after that.”  
  
  “I’d like a beer, please,” said Shadow. “Whatever you’ve got.

1l8y73u,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1l8y73u/aitah_for_calling_out_dates_addiction/,AITAH for calling out dates addiction?,"I (36f;2 kids) met up with a guy (30m) after a few weeks of chatting. Seemed cool and had some similar interests like music and snowboarding. Exchanging pics he sends straight model photo shoot images. Kind of long distance, but I agree to meet up and... Lo and behold he's missing his 4 front teeth (no forewarning). * Was I straight Catfished?* Not a complete jerk, so I shrug it off certain there's some story, my BIL had dental issues too. Ended up going to some art galleries and it was quite pleasant... But there were some sus moments. On the tour off town stopping at a friend's coffee shop, he had to go in the back for a minute with his friend 🤔. Then since he didn't have a jacket and it was chilly, his solution was a shot of whisky. Still overall was a good time and good vibe. 
Continued talking, and meet up again a few weeks later when he came out snowboarding with some friends. We meet up at a nice swanky restaurant, he paid (and it wasn't cheap). Meet back up at the vehicles after dinner and guess who's the supplier of the after party? Guy that just told me he doesn't do blow is now busting out a baggie. *Disappointment* but trying to be open minded. Maybe it's just for this get-together, it was someone's birthday... Decide to assess how much of an issue it actually is. Snowboarding was magical. Could do without as many the beer stops, but overall an excellent day. 
Continue taking but I mention I have some concerns if I were to consider having a relationship. Mention I don't really drink much, and there's just some other things that I had concerns about, keeping it generally vague to not seem judging. 
Fast forward and plan a camping trip. Week of the forecast is straight rain so I ask if we can put it off for a week, still camp, just delayed. Cool, but he was already planning to come out the day planned. Hesitant but, sure, get to know him even better and really see who he is. 
In the first two days drank through all the alcohol in my house. Observed that he is not one to wash his hands after going to the bathroom; 1 or 2. And pulls out a gallon size bag of shrooms, along with more blow, acid, and some weed. 
I'm not some conservative Karen by any means. I partake in certain herbs and will have a few drinks as my stomach allows, but there's a time and place for that other stuff, not a random Wednesday night. Really? Or am I the close minded judgemental.... Anyways...
Camping was... Painful. Starts with a stop at the gas station for cigarettes and a tall boy that he proceeds to immediately open upon getting in the car to drink on the drive down. Setting up he needed help figuring anything out. Camping gear is somewhat universal, not rocket science, clearly not as well versed as he claims. Fire starting- apparently has only relied on ample amounts of lighter fluid and watching the struggle was painful. Some highlights climbing some rocks and skipping rocks at the river. But every day required a new trip to the liquor store (canned margaritas, not bottles at least). 

But THE DRIVE BACK!! Blaring heavy bass EDM on my stock stereo at full blast then argue with me that it can't blow the speakers. Not to mention lyrics consistent of ""let me shove my fist in her pu$$y"" At first I was just turning it to vol 33, noticing at 35 it was hurting my ears. He proceeds to turn it up to 40 which is Max. When I turn it down he asks, ""are you one of those people who can't see of it's loud?"" I respond, ""no but I do value my hearing and don't want to fuck up my speakers."" Him- ""I already told you I could live without my hearing, that don't bother me."" *Ummm!? Hello, other people, other persons car? RESPECT!?*
While on this trip, I had other friends reach out to make future camping plans. He proceeds to try and assume he can come, asking if that would be ok. Ummm. No. After we got back to my place, I hinted the next day, ""when were you planning on heading out?"" He seems shocked like he was planning to stay all month or something. ""It's kind late now"" (only 1 pm, really giving leech vibes at this point, mentioned squatters rights more then once in conversations.) Meanwhile I developed a cold and felt like absolute dog shit. No leave. And this isn't happening. Sorry. 

So am I the a** hole for giving a guy a chance that they blew because they have didn't wash their hands, constantly drink, and do more drugs than I want around me or my kids. ",8,1749661786.0,AITAH,17,0.83,False

Something you need to know about STEM folks is that we tend to be caffeine addicts. Coffee, tea, energy drinks, the works. However, for about the first 3 years of my program, I was the only coffee drinker on my team. Everyone else drank tea or soda. I'm a coffee addict, so I own 2-3 coffee makers at any given time (I keep crappy ones from thrift shops on standby in case my nice one gives out). I brought one said crappy coffee maker to my work so I'd have access to fresh coffee. For 3 years, I was the only one to use it.

In year 4, enter a new postdoctoral associate. Let's call her Anne.

Anne is...a nice person. Friendly. The kind of person you'd take your lunch breaks with or chat with at a company outing. But she's difficult to work with. I don't know if it's because she has her PhD and I don't yet, or if it's because she's 10 years older than me, but her superiority complex got to me quickly. She's always right, and my input is irrelevant (even though I'm more experienced in our field). She sees the good in everyone, which is great except that she never believes me or any of our colleagues when we say another employee has been rude or negligent in their work. And she's very distracting, always wanting to make small talk and refusing to listen when I say I'm too busy to chat. She will literally insert herself into my personal space, hovering around my desk until I agree to chat with her about usually total nonsense (for example, one time she wanted to have a whole conversation about dishwashers...). It's gotten bad enough that I've primarily moved to a remote/hybrid work setting just to get things done.

Anne is also a coffee addict. For the first time in over 4 years, my crappy little coffee maker had a second user. And I was happy to share the machine. Now, she uses it every day, sometimes more than once per day. She's admitted that she's stopped making coffee at her home because she knows she can make it at work. I am her source of caffeine.

Except now I'm graduating. I'm leaving for good. Thus begs the question: would I be the asshole if I took my coffee maker with me? On one hand, I'm a nice person, and I know Anne will get lots of use out of the machine. I also own a nice coffee maker don't technically NEED the crappy little machine, and won't need to bring my own coffee maker to my new job becausse they provide free coffee to employees. On the other hand, Anne hasn't exactly been a great coworker. She's made it hard for me to feel productive and intelligent in my position, and I'm petty. So, would I be the asshole?",160,1749661710.0,AmItheAsshole,180,0.92,False

I wasn’t planning to post again, but some things over the last couple of days are just… weird. Not dramatic, not explosive, just small stuff that keeps stacking up. And I still can’t get a straight answer.

I haven’t brought it up with Emily again. She’s been acting totally normal—maybe too normal. Super affectionate. Extra talkative. Like she’s trying to reset things without actually addressing them. We haven’t talked about Thursday night since I asked her that morning, and it’s like she’s pretending the whole conversation never happened.

But I can’t stop thinking about it. The story she gave me didn’t make sense—about leaving the spa early, running into some guy she used to date from Oregon, having dinner, but not telling me because she “didn’t want me to get the wrong idea.” And she still wouldn’t tell me who it was.

So yesterday after work, I went to the diner. Just to see if anyone remembered anything. I know that probably sounds a little obsessive, but I wasn’t trying to stalk or make a scene. I just went in, ordered a coffee, and casually asked the girl behind the counter if she worked Thursday night. She said yeah, she’d been there.

I showed her the receipt and asked if she remembered who sat at that table.

She looked at it for a second and said, “Oh yeah, I remember her. She came in alone. Kinda spaced out. Ordered two meals and boxed one up right away.”

I asked if she was sure she was alone, and she said yes. She even mentioned that the kitchen staff thought it was odd because she barely touched her food, paid in cash, and left after maybe 20 minutes.

Now I don’t know what to think. If Emily was alone, then why lie about being with someone? If she wasn’t, then why did the cashier say she was?

Then last night, I noticed something else. Emily has this old journal she keeps in her nightstand. It’s always locked—like with an actual little key lock—and I’ve never looked at it because I figured it was private. But when I got home from the gym, it was sitting on the bed. Open. When I walked in, she immediately closed it and kind of laughed and said she was “writing something dumb and didn’t want me to see.” Thing is, I’m pretty sure the page I saw was completely blank. Just… empty. But she was holding a pen. I didn’t press it.

And this might be coincidence, but twice now I’ve caught her on her phone with the volume turned all the way down. Not unusual, I guess, except both times when I walked into the room she locked the screen immediately, looked up, and smiled like nothing happened. One time I swear I saw what looked like a messaging app open—but it wasn’t one I recognized. The icon was just a plain white circle on a black background. I checked the App Store and couldn’t find anything like it.

Also—and again, maybe nothing—but yesterday she said she was going to Target after work. I asked if she could grab toothpaste, and she said “sure.” When she got back, she had a couple bags—snacks, a candle, vitamins—but no toothpaste. I asked about it and she got weirdly flustered. Said she must’ve forgotten, but she’s usually really sharp about stuff like that. She also claimed she went to the big Target across town, but the bag had a receipt from the smaller one near our apartment. Not a huge deal, but… why lie about that?

I know all of this sounds like I’m grasping at straws, but it’s all these little things. None of them are huge on their own. But put together? Something’s not right. I don’t know if she’s hiding something serious, or if I’m just seeing patterns where there aren’t any, but I’ve never felt this much distance in our relationship, and she’s acting like everything is totally fine.

I haven’t decided what to do yet. I just keep thinking: if nothing’s wrong, then why does it feel like she keeps hiding things?",2,1749661701.0,AmIOverreacting,6,1.0,False

👨‍💻 I’m a tech guy — love coding, gadgets, AI, and all things geeky.
☕ Big fan of coffee shops – always down to chill over a good latte or discover new spots.
🥾 I enjoy nature and hikes – can’t wait to explore all the local trails and scenic spots.
🎮 Into video games, but also enjoy deep convos, random road trips, or just vibing with good music.

Quick stats: 28F, Denver area, $78k income, closed on a $385k townhome yesterday after the most stressful 5 months of my entire life.  
  
The Money Part (since everyone asks):  
  
\- Down payment: $30,000 (saved aggressively for 4 years)  
  
\- Closing costs: $8,200  
  
\- Emergency repairs fund: $5,000 (thank GOD I listened to this sub)  
  
\- Moving/immediate needs: $2,800  
  
\- Total cash out of pocket: $46,000  
  
I started this process thinking I was SO prepared. Had my pre-approval, my down payment saved, even read every homebuying book on Amazon. What I didn't expect:  
  
\- House #1: Perfect starter home, offered $15k over asking. Seller accepted then backed out 3 days later for a cash offer  
  
\- House #2: Inspection revealed $25k in foundation issues. NOPE.  
  
\- House #3: Appraisal came in $12k low, seller refused to budge. Back to square one.  
  
\- House #4: My current home! Offered asking price, passed inspection with flying colors, but then...  
  
The lender decided to change underwriters 2 weeks before closing. New guy wanted 47 additional documents including bank statements from 2019 (??) and a letter explaining why I bought coffee 3 times in one week last February. I legitimately thought I was going to have a breakdown.  
  
Things that saved my sanity:  
  
\- This sub (seriously, you guys kept me sane)  
  
\- Having that extra $5k emergency fund - already used $1,200 for immediate fixes  
  
\- My realtor who became my therapist/cheerleader  
  
\- Wine. Lots of wine.  
  
To anyone still in the trenches: Yes, it's absolute chaos. Yes, you'll question every life choice. But when you get those keys... worth every gray hair and stress pimple.",26,1749661656.0,FirstTimeHomeBuyer,3,0.96,False
1l8y4dk,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1l8y4dk/i_was_the_lunch_thief/,I Was the Lunch Thief,"They think it’s the janitor. Or the intern. Or maybe Steve, with his protein powder moral superiority and microwave fish vendetta. 

But it’s me. I am the lunch thief. 

Every office has one. A shadow flitting between fridge shelves. A name whispered in irritated Slack threads. A ghost with barbecue sauce fingerprints. And for the past six months at McGuffin Partners, I’ve been that ghost. 

It didn’t start with malice. It started with hunger. You don’t really understand the phrase ""cost of living"" until you’re paying $2,300 for a studio the size of your mom's Tupperware drawer. After rent, student loans, and anxiety meds, my bank balance hovered at $41.17. For two weeks I rationed ramen and half-crushed protein bars. Then, one Thursday: a brown paper bag. No name. Inside, a turkey sandwich with cranberry chutney, kettle chips, and a chocolate pudding. 

It wasn’t stolen. It was... rescued. 

I told myself it was a one-time thing. 

A week later, I was facing down another ketchup-packet tomato soup when it appeared again: another unmarked bag. This time? Mediterranean chicken wrap, tzatziki, olives. 

I should’ve stopped. But I was hooked. These weren’t just meals. They were edible acts of love. Bananas cut into thirds. Sandwiches constructed with architectural precision. On Tuesday, a sticky note with a message: ""You got this today, babe. Love you."" I rolled my eyes and tossed it in the trash. I wasn't here for someone else's mid-morning affection. I was here for the sandwich, stacked, sliced, and wrapped like a gift from the universe. 
I laughed. Alone. Chewing on someone else's dill pickle spear. 

The All-Hands Ultimatum:

It began innocently enough, an all-hands meeting in the conference room, hastily scheduled and suspiciously well-catered. Bagels. Coffee. A fruit tray nobody touched. Our Director of Operations took the floor, clearing her throat with the gravitas of someone about to announce layoffs or a fire drill. 

""We need to talk,"" she said, pausing dramatically, ""about the sanctity of the lunch fridge."" 

Gasps. 

Murmurs. 

Somewhere, Steve flexed angrily. 

They laid out the crimes like a Netflix true-crime docuseries: missing granola bars, phantom yogurts, sandwiches gone without a trace. A PowerPoint slide declared in bold Arial: 

This Is Not a Communal Fridge. 

Delores from accounting sat in the front row, arms crossed, nodding like a judge. There was a new sign taped to the refrigerator the next morning. All caps. Red ink. Threatening tone: 

FOOD THIEVES WILL BE TERMINATED. 

I read it eating someone's leftover Chipotle, foil-wrapped and full of promise.

Was it Wrong? Absolutely. But didn’t I work harder than anyone else? Didn’t I stay late, debugging spaghetti code abandoned by developers who'd long since ghosted the company? Didn’t I deserve a little kindness? That lunch was kindness, wrapped in wax paper. So I took it. Again. And again. The thrill became ritual. I opened the fridge each morning like a kid tiptoeing down the stairs on Christmas. Every day was culinary roulette: roast beef with horseradish aioli, lemon couscous with grilled halloumi. Sushi. 

Sushi! I ate it with the fridge still open, like a raccoon at a five-star buffet. 

The guilt dimmed. The justifications multiplied. ""It'll just get thrown out."" ""I'm reducing waste."" ""I'm basically an environmentalist."" 

Then came the real temptation: client lunches. Catered wraps. Artisanal salads. Sliders with truffle aioli. Intended for VIPs in glass-walled conference rooms. Sometimes extras were left. Sometimes I didn’t wait to find out. I timed coffee breaks to intercept the delivery guy. Circled the perimeter like a wolf in business casual. Snatched trays under the guise of ""helping set up."" I was no longer just a thief. I was a connoisseur. A lunchtime opportunist. A legend in my own mind. 

Enter: Delores from Accounting 

Not management. 

Not HR. 

Delores. Quiet. Cardigan-clad. Chronically underestimated. She labeled her yogurt. She brought in homemade granola. She made her own kombucha. And she watched. For three months, her kale-quinoa lunches vanished without a trace. She filed no complaints. Raised no alarms. But the silence was deceptive. ""Enough is enough,"" she said to no one in particular, as she packed her lunch one fateful morning. 

The trap was methodical. A pudding cup so decadently rich it glistened under the breakroom lights like a jewel of dairy-based temptation. A note, folded with familiar charm, its edges luring like siren song. It was the kind of lunch treasure I couldn’t resist,a holy grail of sweet, creamy opportunity. 

I thought I had been gaming the system. But Delores was the system. And I never stood a chance. 

The Pudding Incident:

I ate it around 11:45. By 12:15, I was sweating. By 12:30, pale. By 12:42, I was in the third stall on the fifth floor, regretting every decision I had ever made. A full-scale gastrointestinal apocalypse. By 1:00, the realization of what had happened struck me. 

In the aftermath, my pale face, trembling hands, and the unmistakable weight of consequence settling in my gut alongside that cursed pudding was clear to anyone who saw me. I had never felt so hollow. Not from hunger, but from knowing I had crossed some invisible line that couldn’t be uncrossed. The pudding had been a trap, yes, but it was also a mirror. And what I saw in that reflection was someone I didn’t recognize. Regret swelled in my chest, sharp and unrelenting. Every stolen sandwich, every tossed note of affection, every quietly consumed kindness came back at once, a parade of small betrayals I could no longer laugh off.   

It wasn’t the pudding that broke me. It was the realization that I had become everything I thought I was better than. 

I spotted Delores near the water cooler as I staggered down the hall, hollow-eyed and clammy. She didn’t gloat. She didn’t sneer. She just looked at me with quiet resolve, like someone watching justice take its natural course. 

""You always take the good ones,"" she said, not unkindly. ""I figured you wouldn’t be able to resist."" 

HR called me at 2:30. There was no need for theatrics. I told them everything: the sandwiches, the notes, the catered lunches I’d inhaled like a feral executive. I admitted to every stolen bite. I didn’t cry. But I broke somewhere small and important inside. 

The Moral, Maybe?

 The job is gone. My reputation? Compost. I’m probably a cautionary tale in onboarding slides now. But I learned something: About decency. About restraint. About how sometimes the softest voice in the room is the one you should fear most. Maybe one day, I’ll forgive myself. But not yet. Not while I can still taste the betrayal.",1,1749661611.0,stories,1,0.6,False

I remember being at the cemetery on Memorial Day, visiting my great-grandfather's grave and noticing that the adjacent children's cemetery had a handful of graves with blue rocks on the headstones. They were a random assortment of gold ball sizes river pebbles, uniformly bright blue, but not painted - instead they were almost dyed, their color so natural, it seemed like they formed that way.

Then one day, Marcus Rigsby's parents went to wake him for breakfast and they found his bed empty. They threw back the covers in exasperation and found a blue stone in the middle of the bed. A search was organized, almost immediately; our town is small and it juts up against a large forested region, so finding him would have been a monumental task.

I remember going out before work and searching after I came home along with most of the adults in the town, but we never found him, not even a trace. When the fervor died down and only his family still searched, that was when Margaret Collins disappeared as well. She's been in the backyard playing one minute and the next she was gone, the swing she was on still listing back and forth, occupied by a single blue stone. Again, a search party was created but she was never found either. 

Less than a week later, another child disappeared and the same type of blue stone was left behind. Over the last 6 months, 157 children have vanished leaving only blue stones and questions behind and not a single one of them has ever been found. 

The families who still had children began to sleep in the school's gymnasium, an effort to ward off whatever was stealing the children. Not surprisingly, it did not work and children vanished in the middle of the night without waking a single person, and even when there was a person standing watch.

Our town wasn't big to begin with, but between the disappearances and the families who moved before their kids vanished, there was just a hundred or so of us left. 

When Harry Brown vanished last week - the last child left - we assumed whatever this was had ended. I sat in the kitchen drinking coffee, my pregnant wife still in bed, while I finalized the U haul order and packing for our move to Chicago next week.

Then she came down the stairs, and placed a single blue stone on the table next to me - she said it had been on her stomach when she woke up.",11,1749661607.0,shortscarystories,0,1.0,False

Last week I decided to try cutting back, drinking just one weak cup of coffee for a few days before switching to 1-2 cups of black tea for a few days, before cutting off completely. It was horrible the few 2-3 days, not only was it really hard to not have that nice cup of coffee after meals that I was so used to, but the headaches were unbearable, so bad I could not sleep for a few nights without taking painkillers. I was angry, tired and irritable too.

However I noticed today that my energy has been stable and kind of good, but in a weird way because it feels almost abnormal. It's like my body and brain has a lot of energy and wants to use it, but my mind is also telling me it's not true and that I really need to drink some coffee, not sure how to really explain it. It feels like this underlying ""grogginess"" that's always been there is going away, I feel less anxious which in turn makes me feel more confident, my appetite has improved (both good and bad) and also my eyes look less tired.

My boyfriend and I (22 yrs old) are looking to move away from our home in North Dakota. We're both huge nature lovers — especially drawn to places like the Blue Ridge Parkway. Ideally, we’re looking for a small town (under 50,000 people - give or take) with a larger city within about an hour’s drive if possible (kind of like Brevard, NC to Asheville, NC). We really enjoy Asheville, but would rather live in a subarb around because of the traffic. 

Some nice-to-haves include:
- Farmers markets and access to organic/natural grocery options
- A walkable downtown with small shops and a good atmosphere for young people 
- Plenty of local coffee shops (not just Starbucks or other chains)
- Affordable rent — ideally under $1,500/month (we don't need anything fancy and only need a 1 bed, looking on Craiglist and Facebook mostly)
- Snow is totally fine, just not multiple feet of it like back home

We visited Brevard, NC and completely fell in love with the town and the people — the vibe was everything we’re looking for. Unfortunately, the housing and job market there is pretty tough if you're not a seasonal worker. While we're planning to move mostly for a change of pace and better quality of life, we’re also both planning on working in coffee shops, so we don’t need a booming job market or anything high-paying.

We’re open to other smaller towns near mountains or even beaches — just looking for places that feel community-oriented, nature-loving, and welcoming energy. We know we’ll have to compromise on some things, but if anything even comes close to this, we’d love to hear about it!

You told me today you are going to Bangalore during your summer break. I asked if I could tag along. Just that. A question, stupid and naked.

And you snapped.

“We are divorced for a reason,” you said. “If I am still spending my time with you, what’s the point of even ending it? I am 36, when do I get to move on, when do I find a new partner?”

Then the line went dead.

And it felt like something inside me finally matched the silence outside.

You were right. You have been right for a long time. And I have been dragging my dead weight through your life like an old suitcase with broken wheels. But that didn’t make it hurt any less.

Because you had once promised, through the cracks of the failing marriage, that after the divorce, we would still get coffee sometimes. Still catch a movie. Still laugh, if nothing else. That we would be the exception, not the mess. That you would still show up, even if you no longer stayed.

But life doesn’t owe me your promises. You don’t owe me anything. And I know it would be unfair to expect these things from you.

It’s just that I don’t know how to live with that.

I have no identity without you. I never did.
You weren’t just my partner. You were my person. My reason to wake up. My shelter. My mirror. My home. I guess… you still are.
I know I never could bring out that same feeling in you. And I am sorry. Truly.

You had others - friends, sisters, shoulders to lean on. I didn’t. I only had you. That’s why I count hours till 10 PM, waiting for those ten stolen minutes of conversation every night. That’s why I hold on harder than I should. That’s why I suffocate you, even when I try not to.

I can’t imagine walking into Truffles alone. Or sitting at Pizza Bakery without you across the table. Buying books at Blossom without your voice arguing about which Murakami to pick. Forum Mall. Orion. Oasis. Those places are haunted now.

I just wanted one more time. Not to fix anything. Not to restart. Just to be with you again. Just once. Because if I don’t… I don’t think I ever will. And I don’t know how to live with that.

I’m afraid. Really afraid.
Of turning into dust in a city we once called ours.

You know, one of my worst fears was always this: That I will stop saying, “I will see you at home,”
And start whispering, “When can I see you again?”

Now I live inside that fear.

You didn’t break me. I broke me. I broke us.

But even now, all I want is to sit beside you. Even if you don’t look at me. Even if you never speak again. Just for a while.
To remember I once belonged somewhere in this world.

I don’t want to write anything after this.

Because everything else would just feel like goodbye.

My boyfriend and I (22 yrs old) are looking to move away from our home in North Dakota. We're both huge nature lovers — especially drawn to places like the Blue Ridge Parkway. Ideally, we’re looking for a small town (under 50,000 people - give or take) with a larger city within about an hour’s drive if possible (kind of like Brevard, NC to Asheville, NC). We really enjoy Asheville, but would rather live in a subarb around because of the traffic. 

Some nice-to-haves include:
- Farmers markets and access to organic/natural grocery options
- A walkable downtown with small shops and a good atmosphere for young people 
- Affordable rent — ideally under $1,500/month (we don't need anything fancy and only need a 1 bed, looking on Craiglist and Facebook mostly)
- Snow is totally fine, just not multiple feet of it like back home

We visited Brevard, NC and completely fell in love with the town and the people — the vibe was everything we’re looking for. Unfortunately, the housing and job market there is pretty tough if you're not a seasonal worker.  While we're planning to move mostly for a change of pace and better quality of life, we’re also both planning on working in coffee shops, so we don’t need a booming job market or anything high-paying.

We’re open to other smaller towns near mountains or even beaches — just looking for places that feel community-oriented, nature-loving, and welcoming energy. We know we’ll have to compromise on some things, but if anything even comes close to this, we’d love to hear about it!

TOWNS WEVE LOOKED AT RECENTLY:

- Blacksburg, VA
- Abingdon, VA

  Rachel  
  
  It was going to be the best Christmas ever.  
  
  That was saying a lot because Rachel Johnson had experienced some wonderful Christmas holidays over the years. Back when she'd been Rachel Finn, the daughter of college professors who took every school break as an invitation to educate their own children as diligently as they educated hundreds of undergraduates, Christmas had included trips to historical sites in the US, geographical wonders, and, yes, that one Christmas where they'd taken her and her brother, Grant, to New York City, where they visited one museum after another. Rachel, all braces and long, gangly limbs as a teenager, hadn't been nearly as taken with the educational side of the trip as she had been with the lights of the big city, the holiday decorations, and the fancy dinners, keeping them out late every night, as she counted herself so lucky to be in the most exciting place in the world for Christmas.  
  
  That Christmas had ranked at the top of her list... until she'd met Micah.  
  
  And then? Well, Micah and every Christmas spent with him, no matter where they were, pretty much trumped every childhood Christmas she'd experienced. (Sorry not sorry, Mom and Dad.)  
  
  They had been newlyweds their first Christmas together. They'd been living in the house she'd owned long before he came along, packing up boxes and getting it ready for the closing day, anticipating life in the huge house they were building out in the country, savoring every moment, every long night, and every sweet second together.  
  
  They'd had plans to spend Christmas Day with her parents and his mother both, right on the university campus where her father was now president, where her mother spent almost every night of the week entertaining very important academic people at the president's manor, right across from the library. Grant and his girlfriend, Maddie, were planning on being there as well, where they'd likely sit around and watch football most of the day, all while stuffing themselves full of whatever Grant was planning on cooking for them all.  
  
  Oh, the very thought of all that food had made Rachel queasy during that first married Christmas. She'd hidden her new, ever-present nausea from Micah, knowing just exactly what it meant, given her nursing career and given the way she'd meticulously charted everything from the minute they'd gotten married. Being queasy like that meant good news, she knew, which had been affirmed with a home pregnancy test and celebrated with a solo shopping trip to the baby gear superstore, where she had picked up a gift for her husband.  
  
  Christmas Day belonged to their parents, but Christmas Eve had been all theirs. She'd decided to wait until that evening to give him the gift, to let him in on the secret, and to spend the rest of the night dreaming of all that was ahead of them.  
  
  But she was horrible with waiting. Absolutely horrible.  
  
  So, Christmas Eve had begun at 6am. Technically, that was so totally Christmas Eve, right? Micah, in his exuberance over having cancelled all of his appointments at his dental practice for the holiday, had intentionally not set an alarm for the morning, but Rachel hadn't needed any help waking up, anticipating the most exciting day of her life thus far, surely.  
  
  The most exciting day of Micah's life, too.  
  
  He'd still been snoring when she'd climbed out of bed and scurried past the packing boxes and into the living room, where she'd snatched up the present with his name on it and rushed back into their bedroom.  
  
  She'd been amazed to find that he was still asleep, that he couldn't subconsciously gather that this was the biggest moment of his life. No problem, though, as it had given her a reason to climb up on top of him, sit on his thighs, and begin poking him in the chest.  
  
  ""Micah,"" she'd said. ""Micah. Micah. Micah.""  
  
  Just as she'd begun to consider tickling him to wake him up (or just smacking him on the side of the head with the gift box), he'd blinked his eyes slowly, peering at her with an obvious question on his lips... just before it disappeared, lost in the smile he gave her.  
  
  Wow. That smile.  
  
  ""Never gets old,"" he'd murmured, reaching up to pull her face down to his. ""Waking up and seeing you. It never gets old...""  
  
  It never did for her, either. All those years of waiting for a happy love story to happen in her life, all those years she'd spent alone, all those years that he'd been making his way to her... well, it all made perfect sense every day that she woke up to him, to being kissed like this, to knowing that it had been worth every single second of singleness --  
  
  ""Hands to yourself for a second, mister,"" she'd chided as his hands had started unlacing the string on her pajama pants. She'd plopped the gift onto his chest. ""Merry Christmas!""  
  
  ""It's not Christmas yet,"" he'd said, glancing over at the clock. ""It's barely even Christmas Eve, Rachel. This was our only day to sleep in, since Grant said we had to be over there at --""  
  
  ""I know,"" she'd murmured, leaning over to kiss him again, if only to shut him up for a second. Not that she didn't love hearing him talk, but wow, she'd needed him to open the gift. ""Open the gift.""  
  
  He'd just grinned and shaken his head. ""You first,"" he'd said, his hands on her hips for just a moment before he'd let go and leaned over to his bedside table, opening up the drawer and pulling out a package of his own.  
  
  ""What's that?,"" she'd gasped.  
  
  ""Your gift,"" he'd answered. ""Knew you'd snoop, so I had to hide it.""  
  
  She would have snooped under normal circumstances, but she'd been so consumed about the details of his gift that she hadn't even looked for a gift with her name on it.  
  
  ""Micah, I wouldn't have snooped,"" she'd lied.  
  
  ""Sure,"" he'd laughed. ""But this way I know for sure that you're going to be surprised.""  
  
  She'd grinned down at him before ripping into the paper, even as he'd put his hands back to her hips, drawing her closer to him, doing his best to distract her from --  
  
  ""Tickets?,"" she'd asked, looking at the papers in the box he'd wrapped up for her, papers with a fancy airline logo across the top. ""Are these tickets?""  
  
  ""Yeah,"" he'd said. ""Check out the destination.""  
  
  ""Rio de Janeiro,"" Rachel had read, her heart speeding up. ""Lima. Buenos Aires. Oh, Micah, are we --""  
  
  ""We are,"" he'd laughed out loud, sitting up to kiss her face to face, sliding his hands up under her shirt. ""Going to see the world with you, Rachel. Europe last summer, South America this summer.""  
  
  Summer. Rachel had done the math in her head and had felt her heart sink. ""Oh, wow,"" she'd murmu  
red.  
  
  ""We'll take off for three weeks in August,"" he'd murmured against her neck, leaving kisses there, his hands roaming and his body moving closer to hers. ""We're only stopping in the city for a few days. Then, we're going to see the Amazon. Go backpacking. Remote, off the grid. Me and you. All alone out there.""  
  
  Except not. Rachel had known the truth of it even as Micah's mind was already heading that way, given how he began to attempt to take off her shirt --  
  
  ""I hope you got travel insurance,"" she'd sighed.  
  
  And he'd dropped his hands, backing away just a little, an uncertain smile on his face. ""You don't want to be alone with me?,"" he'd asked.  
  
  ""No, that's not it,"" she'd said. ""It's just that... well, we're not going to be alone in August.""  
  
  He'd opened his mouth to ask for clarification, but she'd offered none, handing him his gift instead.  
  
  ""What do you mean --""  
  
  ""Just open the gift,"" she'd said softly.  
  
  And he had, concern in his eyes as he'd torn apart the paper, the gift there between them, her helping him to open the box, then staring right back at him as he saw the little tiny T-shirt that said Daddy Loves Me.  
  
  ""What?,"" he'd asked, breathlessness in the question.  
  
  ""It just happened,"" she'd said, knowing full well that it hadn't just happened, as she'd charted it, as she'd counted the days, as she'd known when it was time and had come to bed that night wearing the action shorts. (Seriously, there was always action when she wore those tiny little shorts to bed because Micah, bless his heart, was predictable like that, and she'd used that knowledge to her advantage.)  
  
  So, honestly, it hadn't just happened.  
  
  Still, though. Given the shock on his face, she'd begun worrying that this wasn't welcome news, even though he'd said, from their wedding night on, that he'd celebrate pregnancy just as soon as God granted it to them.  
  
  But her worries had ceased when Micah - strong, confident, solid Micah - had looked at her with tears in his eyes and had whispered, ""Thank you. Rachel, thank you.""  
  
  ""You're welcome,"" she'd managed, as though she'd done it all by herself.  
  
  Which she hadn't, clearly, the memories of it all still so vivid in her mind that morning as he'd put his hands back to her hips, picked her up so gently, and laid her down there next to him, moving over her and leaving her to think that now -- yes, now -- they were really going to celebrate --  
  
  But no. Micah had begun crying. In that wonderfully masculine, completely consumed way of his, reminding Rachel of all that he'd ever said about how he'd counted himself out when it came to things like marriage, like having a family of his own, like being happy, as he'd leaned over and spoken, not to her, but to someone else....  
  
  ""Daddy does love you,"" he'd murmured, leaning down to kiss her right where he'd untied her pajama pants. ""So, so much. And forever.""  
  
  Before Rachel had been able to formulate a response to this, her own tears gathering in her eyes, he'd smiled up at her. ""I'll have to be careful with you now.""  
  
  ""Not too careful,"" she'd insisted, pulling him down on top of her, marveling over how great Christmas was already.  
  
  The next Christmas had been even sweeter. In the months preceding it, the morning sickness had run its course, the doctor had found two heartbeats instead of one, they'd done a big reveal party with pink everywhere, and their travel insurance paid up so much that it covered the last minute expenses they incurred when Rachel went on bed rest. By Christmas, Mia and Zoe had arrived, of course, but neither one of them was sleeping through the night.  
  
  No loss there, as the Christmas memory that year was of Micah slowly pacing the nursery with one sleeping pink bundle in his arms, while Rachel sat in the corner of the room holding the second, neither of them daring to speak, only mouthing words back and forth to one another.  
  
  Merry Christmas, his lips had offered her, along with a satisfied smile.  
  
  Such a sweet, peaceful Christmas.  
  
  Then, there were completely chaotic Christmas celebrations, full of life and sound and movement and so much joy. The girls were walking, the girls were talking, the girls were old enough to understand that the colorful boxes held toys, the girls would wake them up at 2am on Christmas morning to see what Santa had brought, and the girls were so big, so impossibly grown up, with Micah's brown eyes and Rachel's smile, talking their twin language and giggling at everything and nothing at all, just exactly like girls their age were already starting to do.  
  
  Kindergarten. They were in kindergarten now. Rachel couldn't fathom how that had happened, how the years of being at home full time with the twins had sprinted by so quickly. She and Micah hadn't ever seriously discussed having another baby in all that time because two at once always felt like enough, and now that they were older, the thought of starting all over again was just exhausting.  
  
  Rachel had lost herself a little in having children. Okay, so she'd lost a lot of herself in having children. The minute they were in school, she'd felt the loss of purpose once the house was quiet and still. After just a short while of that phantom, unsettling peace, she'd declared that it was time for her to get back to being her, and the best way she could figure to do that would be going back to work.  
  
  Micah had been supportive. The doctor's office where she'd spent most of her career before children had told her they would have a spot for her after the new year. She'd been able to take the time at home that first semester of the girls' kindergarten year to take some refresher courses, to sit for her licensure exam again, and to prepare herself to leave home.  
  
  Now it was only a week away... and she was having some doubts.  
  
  She enjoyed being at home. She liked having a meal ready for Micah when he got home from work, doing all the laundry while the girls were in school, having the time to comparison shop at the grocery store, and spending the afternoons reorganizing all that she'd never had a spare moment to organize in the toddler years. It was work, but it was good work. At the end of the day, she went to bed ready to do it all again the next day, content...  
  
  Well, almost content. If only there wasn't that voice in the back of her mind, questioning it all.  
  
  It wasn't enough to just be a mom, was it? To just stay at home, to be a room mother and PTA president for the next thirteen years, to make her life all about her husband and their children, to never earn a single cent, and to be defined only by being a wife and a mother.  
  
  It wasn't enough, was it?  
  
  She wasn't sure. But now wasn't the time to stress out over it. Well, technically it was way past time, since the decision had been made and she'd be back at work in a week, but she pushed that thought aside, focusing instead on Christmas.  
  
  Because this Christmas? This Christmas was going to be the best Christmas ever.  
  
  Why? Well, some of the family would be coming in for Christmas Eve, and for the first time ever, she and Micah would have a full house for the holiday, just like they always said they would back when they'd built the house.  
  
  Joy and Taylor, who practically lived with them anyway in the suite at the end of the house built especially with them in mind, would be coming over. They did fine at their own apartment near the center for adults with Down's Syndrome, working their jobs that were in walking distance and living near enough to the church Micah and Joy had grown up in for people to check in on them. But Micah and Rachel had plans that one day they'd be living here if their health became a concern, if they needed help, or if they just wanted to be with family. They spent at least a couple of nights a week here already and planned on spending the week of Christmas with their nieces, who would no doubt spend the majority of their time playing board games with them and insisting that they read yet another book together.  
  
  Also on the guest list were Grant and Maddie, the former of whom was going to be doing the cooking, of course, on his one day off for the holiday. He had plans to have the restaurant open on Christmas Day, having figured that the profits from that one high traffic day would be enough to pay off the very last mortgage payment, which was  
, admittedly, a huge deal. Maddie had told Rachel that he was so intent on doing it so that they could finally afford to buy a house in the new year, which was becoming a more and more urgent need as the days went by, counting down to April, when the baby was due.  
  
  They were also expecting Jacob and Gracie, home for good from Argentina, where he'd spent the last five years working. He was coming back to take a job with a new company closer to home, practically in Micah and Rachel's backyard. With their three children and a fourth one on the way, they would likely liven up the holiday festivities, but Rachel was glad for that, so eager to welcome them back to the US and help them transition into this new place, where Micah, ever the gracious cousin, had offered to help Jacob out however he could.

Natalie, Micah's mother, would also be there. As far as mothers-in-law went, Natalie was the best, always the calm, quiet voice of reason and never one to be critical, at least not of her daughter-in-law, who she took special care around, especially with all that Rachel had on her plate with Micah's schedule, the kids, the new house, Joy and Taylor always here, and --  
  
  Her phone buzzed at her just as she was making her way to the fridge, thinking through the preparations she had to do before the guests began showing up.  
  
  Barbara Finn.  
  
  Ahh. Speaking of critical.  
  
  ""Hey, Mom,"" Rachel sighed, stopping her preparations for her guests and preparing herself in another way instead.  
  
  Yeah, there were daughters who had issues with their mothers, but Rachel hadn't ever been one of them. She and Barbara had always had a good relationship, had honestly been friends, and were once able to share freely with each other, in a way that had naturally progressed from openness when Rachel was a teenager to real camaraderie as she'd become an adult.  
  
  And then, she had children and left her career, and... things were different with her mother.  
  
  No fault of Barbara's. That's just who she was. A bra-burning, vocal, angry feminist who was now entering her senior years... and wouldn't dream of going braless (seriously, menopause does things to your body), was no longer angry about much of anything (and why would she be, given how great her life was), but still a feminist at heart, at her very core. She'd applauded Rachel's decision to give her all to the twins because it was Rachel's decision, and wasn't feminism about being free to do whatever you wanted to do because you were a woman who could do whatever you wanted to?  
  
  Be a homemaker, baby. Just do it because you can do it, Rachel. Because women can have it all! Be with your little ones while they're little and don't let the man or a raging feminist tell you that you should miss out on any of that!  
  
  Women empowered! Empowered to give up their careers and be barefoot and pregnant and...  
  
  But, seriously, Rachel. For the rest of your life? A homemaker? Enough is enough. Once the girls are in school, enough is enough, surely, and you need to get back out there and be fabulous once again.  
  
  Barbara hadn't said that, of course, but Rachel had heard it in the relieved breath her mother had released when her daughter had announced that she was going back to work.  
  
  She also heard it in all the little, “innocuous” side comments Barbara made all the time.  
  
  Sigh.  
  
  ""Hey,"" Barbara Finn answered back. ""Hope I'm not waking you up. Stay at home moms get to sleep in, right?""  
  
  See? Like that.  
  
  ""If they do, I've really gotten the raw end of that deal, Mom,"" she said. ""I've been up getting things ready for hours. There's no rest for the weary around here. Especially not during the holidays.""  
  
  ""Get that husband of yours to help out a little more,"" Barbara chided. ""Women aren't made to carry the entire load of the housework by themselves. You're in an equal partnership.""  
  
  Well, she was in fine form this morning.  
  
  Yes, Barbara and Rachel were friends... the kind of friends who could offer unsolicited advice like this. (One sided, though, as Rachel had never dared to suggest that her mother was wrong about some things. Which she so totally was.)  
  
  ""He carries the load, too, Mom,"" Rachel murmured, smiling to think of how Micah had gotten up before she had this morning to run a very special errand. ""He does a lot around here. And he brings home the entire income, which is more than his load, quite honestly.""  
  
  ""He's not going to be the only one bringing home an income for much longer,"" Barbara answered. ""Can't wait to hear how it is back at the clinic for you.""  
  
  Yes, her return to work was being lauded near and far by her parents. It was good for a woman to have something outside of the home. It was good for a woman to contribute to society in a meaningful way.  
  
  It was good for a woman to earn her ""own"" money, even if she was in an ""equal partnership"" with her husband. (Barbara tended to talk out of both sides of her mouth about this, quite honestly.)  
  
  ""One more week at home,"" Rachel said, not surprised that the mention of her diminishing time here made her just a little sad. What would she miss out on? Being the carpool mom, volunteering at the school, going to a ladies' Bible study on a weekday morning, having the afternoon free to meet up with some of the college girls from church and have coffee, invest herself in discipleship relationships because she had the time to do it all...  
  
  There was all of that, of course.  
  
  But Barbara didn't hear what her daughter didn't say.  
  
  ""And a busy week at that,"" she added, continuing on as Rachel thought about what was ahead. ""I want to help take some of the burden off of you and see if I can get the gifts earlier for you and get it all set up.""  
  
  ""I can handle it,"" Rachel said. ""Grant's got the food for tomorrow set up. Said he'd try to get away to eat with us, but... well, we'll see. But either way, he's having it delivered straight to your house.""  
  
  ""He needs to take a break,"" Barbara chided.  
  
  Get to work, Rachel. Take a break, Grant.  
  
  See? Both sides of her mouth.  
  
  ""That's what he's doing today,"" Rachel murmured, agreeing with her mother on the part about Grant needing to rest, at least.  
  
  ""I tried to get in touch with him to see when he might come by, but I can't reach him. Maddie either. Do they ever answer their phones?""  
  
  Grant, no. Maddie, yes. But only now and again and only for sad, discouraged conversations where she never spoke ill of Grant or her marriage but exuded so much disappointment that Rachel could easily discern it.  
  
  No wonder at that, what with the schedule Grant kept. Rachel doubted that he even got more than an hour with Maddie every day.  
  
  Barbara didn't need to know this. ""She's working on the next book,"" she said, explaining it away. ""Spends most days at the library, working on that, so she probably keeps her phone silenced.""  
  
  ""I remember those days,"" Barbara sighed. Yes, Barbara was published as well. Her dissertation in women's studies had led to a book on feminism and its impact on traditional home values.  
  
  Yeah. She'd written the book on that. Literally.  
  
  Rachel couldn't remember her mother's busy writing schedule or the promotion that followed because she'd been so young when it all happened. But there had been plenty of talk about it all, was talk of it even now, all these years later, along with the still shocked murmurs from other women's studies experts who couldn't fathom why Barbara had married, then taken her husband's last name, and then -- gasp! -- had children, of all things.  
  
  Seriously, Barbara. What were you thinking?  
  
  But even that had worked to her advantage later on. Grant and Rachel were successful adults which made it to her credit all these years later. Before Rachel had married and made the choice to stay at home, Barbara had regularly paraded her daughter around, telling people about her career, about how she was single, about how she was making her own way in the world and all. (Yes, even as Rachel had been abysmally lonely, wishing for nothing more than a husband and a family. She wouldn't dare say anything of the sort to Barbara, of course.)  
  
  She had a good relationship with her mother.... kind of.  
  
  ""I'm looking forward to seeing you,"" she said, thinking that her mother's concern was rooted in love and that no matter what she said or how it hurt, she did what she did because she honestly believed she was looking out for her children's best interest.  
  
  ""Me, too, Rachel,"" Barbara answered. ""I was thinking --""  
  
  ""Oh, hey, Mom,"" she said, looking at her phone. ""I have another call coming in.""  
  
  ""Take it,"" Barbara said. ""It could be work.""  
  
  On Christmas Eve? Before she even started working again?  
  
  ""Probably,"" Rachel sighed, knowing that her mother needed to believe it, to think her daughter this important, to assure herself that this staying at home business was good and done. ""I'll see you tomorrow?",1,1749661223.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

---> questions marked with arrows below

...I welcome feedback if it looks like too much or there's something I left out that *everyone* coming to BCN has to see.

******
Background: 50yoF US-American w/ 2 adult children in their 20's. I've been before & lived in BCN in my 20s & am showing my son & daughter for their first time. I'm driving down through Costa Brava (Figueres, Gerona, L'Escala) with my 20yo daughter who's been studying in Paris. My 23yo son is flying in from Japan (where he lives) to meet us in BCN. Neither of them speak Spanish, nor Catalan. All are foodies (daughter loves coffee & chocolate & cheese, son loves desserts, tomatos & craft cocktails) and they are curious about architecture & nightlife.

---> Where is your favorite bar for craft cocktails? (So far, I'm thinking La Dama in Gracia for the modernist entrance)

---> If you could only get reservations and splurge on one fancy restaurant in BCN, what would it be?
*****

Day 1: son arrives and needs to find his way to the hotel in L'Eixample. Daughter & I drive in our rental car from the Greek ruins in Empuries and turn it in at the airport, make our way to the hotel. Maybe we grab a menú del día in L'Eixample (maybe Batea or Cerveseria catalana if we're lazy) or near Sant Antoni?  (Perhaps Pinotxo, Can Vilaró, Mal Educat or Bar Bodega Gol something like that)

*Maybe we check out White Rabbit Museum (https://maps.app.goo.gl/xYBU64iE9XEgPCuo8)


Day 2: Barri Gotic
- Xurros i Xocolate (Carrer de Petritxol?)
- Casa Padellà (Barcelona History Museum MUHBA)
- Muralla romana
- Plaça del pi

(ideas for la comida: Bar Joan, L’Antic Bocoi del Gótic, bodega la palma, etc.)

PM: Casa Batllò?
* I'm waiting for the night concert schedule to come out for Casa Batllò, as I think that would be a great way to see it. (https://www.casabatllo.es/venta-entradas/visita-noches-magicas/calendario/)

---> Has anyone done the night tour for Casa Batllò? How is it?

Day 3: 

9am Park Güell

--> restaurant in Gràcia for menú del día or esmorzar de forquilla: Any Recommendations? I was thinking it would be nice to get something on our way from Park Güell to Sagrada Familia, but is it just easier to grab a taxi to somewhere?

16:30pm tour Sagrada Familia with towers (hoping to catch the late afternoon sun) 
---> we can select which towers to tour. Is the passion better at this time? Or will we be blinded by the afternoon (edited: was setting) sun?

Day 4: 
Hospital de Sant Pau 
(this might just be me, if they don't have interest) 
21:00 guitar & flamenco concert at Palau de la Mùsica Catalana 
Drinks at Els 4 Gats
---> suggestions for dinner or a discoteca/club?

Day 5: fly to Mallorca

*We will be staying 1 more night in Sants before we fly out of Barcelona to our respective countries (USA/Japan)

* I still want to get to Casa Amatller (for chocolate and/or a tour) but am hoping we can work it in, since it's not far from the hotel (maybe after white rabbit on day 1?). I'm not sure how exhausted my son will be after a 30-hr flight with the time change. 

---> I would love them to try esmorzar de forquilla. Do you see a natural place to do this? Would they still be serving somewhere in Gràcia after Park Güell? Maybe beforehand?

I also wanted to take them to the cava bar I used to spend a lot of time at: Can Paixano near the waterfront. 
---> is it still good? Is there somewhere we should go instead?

STOCKTON -- Lights, camera, action! Film crews have taken over the University of the Pacific in Stockton for an upcoming HBO comedy series starring Steve Carell.

For this week only, the University of the Pacific is transforming into ""Ludlow College, Home of the Blues."" Signs, flags and even the bulletin board of campus events were full of Ludlow College memorabilia.

""We're just walking to get coffee and then I noticed there's a sign that used to say Pacific. Now it says Ludlow,"" said Abel Arostigui, UOP's creative content assistant.",13,1749660367.0,Stockton,1,1.0,False

Back at it again with the reverb of nonsense. Either a madman or woke af. You decide.

Or don't. Makes no difference. Because the fact is, after seeing these words, you'll go on about your day per the yuje.

My mistake may have been bombarding the mind with acid so many years ago and tumbling through a waterfall of escalating laughter.

Up and down it went, screaming at my friends on the way to a festival, ""WE'RE HERE!"" They thought, ""we're here at this festival.""

I meant, ""we're here [on a planet (?)]."" That was a decade ago. Some story on repeat until the chapters appear blank with frayed edges. Hilarious.

The breakthrough insight: I don't exist. And then a pinch of laughter, a cosmic joke, existence itself, altogether, undivded, masquerade of individuals. Nonsense through and through. A paradox!

Then the crash after that high, naturally. Insight and integration. Awakening and dark night. Repeat. Over and over until THWAT!

I snap. 

Ear piercing silence. Where'd the commentary go? Where am I? Who am I, etc? I? Hilarious.

Then the model: Awareness. What a wonderful model. Awareness is all there is. Settle into it. Yield to it. Surrender. To what? Awareness.

Then what? Who knows! Yes, who. Me! Me as what? I don't know. All models, useless. Nonsense!

Outcast from the lot. Misfit from the start to be honest, but now, more true than before. Honest. Pure. Thorough. A mess of delight and beauty.

And then magick. Holy Guardian Angel they call it. What a trip. Higher Self. Altogether Self, undivded, everywhere, layered. 

Always has been This. Exactly This in all its bewildering majesty. Confusion? Sure.

Nonsense. Pure, unadulterated, nonsense. Love. Unconditional about it all. No matter what. Still here. As what? Who knows! WHO knows. Any who is who. God? Sure. Jerry? Of course. Jessica? Doubtless.

A joke. Through and through. What to make of it? Anything. Anything at all if it's felt from the center. 

It's the coffee. The mug, blue and stained from filling it to the brim day after day. Empty and full.

Alright so after all of that stream of consciousness jargon, what?

Why waste time (?) scanning these letters for some [whatever is the purpose of reading it]? 

It happens. Here it is after all. You, reading. That's the ""it"" which is here after all. You can say ""I am the reading,"" and it's fine. You can say, ""I witness reading,"" and it's fine. You can say, ""There is no reading, no reader, no words, nothing.""

And it's fine.

Whatever is happening, it's fine. On the grand scale of it at least. And by grace (or luck) it's revealed as such. Little by little. Day by day.",1,1749660261.0,nonduality,0,0.67,False

We’re 3 shows away from concluding Spafford’s annual Spaffski and while I’ve never digested this band's runs in this manner, it offers so much to the experience. Like the blooming of a flower, or gradually waking up to more light in the transition from winter to spring, it’s evident Spafford’s maturity and individual accents are contributing to a sound that will define the future for this band. I look at specific songs that are finding their footing, and considering we are in that great territory of championship/playoffs that again parallel the music, and watching them form around the band or vice versa, it’s too obvious to not point out

The rise to the occasion nature of Tyrese Haliburton, new levels of Connor McDavid, command of time and space of Lamine Yamal that is well beyond his years, or the utter mental and physical mastery that is Carlos Alcaraz on the game of tennis - we are witnessing those that will usher us into the next generation. Or at least it feels that way. 

When Set 1 of night 2 opens with *Fake The Fate*, I feel we are hearing one of our go to’s in the clutch of this era of Spafford, unfolding in front of us. This Fate gets quickly atmospheric, making its first appearance on this Colorado run. Seemingly saved for the moment the band was ready to unleash and ride it, angles are explored and the juices of creativity are easily tapped on a tune the veers quickly post vocals. This version is sprawling, as it soon soars off the beaten path, venturing into 20 minutes of setting up the perimeter of the evenings electronica fence. The downshift of genres from the 15th minute revs the engine to peak RPM and drops without demarcation into *Todd's Tots.* 

Waffle fries this is not. The staggered wind ups of another run debut build the excitement around the quality craftsmanship building our nights’ vessel. We hit the intricate intimacy of Brian’s picking and circular whirlpool swells that increase in deliberate tension, only to contrast with the beauty of *Tots* next chapter. More soft tones of color, dripping with the emotional equivalent of seeing that being you love, Moss finds additional ledges that climb to additional and multiple apex peaks, just before we head back into vocals. Perfection. 

*Crazy* displays the dynamism this band can curveball the audience with, with a radio friendly but jam friendly serenade, delivering on range and a separation of the sets intensity. While still representative of the ability to deliver a soulful and satisfying balance of Spafford's salty, sweat dripping intensity with *Sweet-*ness. Walter Payton approved. 

*Mind's Unchained* lines up next and is the thread that ties that 2.0 Spafford era to beyond, a jam vehicle itself, but used as a swiss army knife or chameleon, that always fits the occasion - set opener, set closer, set filler or encore. While we don't completely “unchain”, the 15-minute  version delivers a bounce and elasticity like jam. Brian takes a buzz saw tone to this Mind jam and severs the setbreak and upon reaching our half time. 

As standard set break fanfare, Chuck greets us with poetry before one funky as hell *Postman's* goes to the land of the lost. The compositional elements of *Postman* are attention alerting preparation before we all know where we are heading. The jam floor caves in with Shon's slap bass, syncopated by Cory's piano augmenting the wacka wacka funk. The groove is defined and the trough is dug. Brian widens the chasm before Cory picks up the mutation strain. And just like that we shift the groove again, the pocket surrounds us as the venture into the Pueblo Plains and an abandonment of any link to Postman. Area 51 jamming now permeates with pan flute moon craters patrolled by Nick, adding pops on the 1. Cory calls the whales and spotlights their arrival with plinko silhouettes. The provocative head bobbing bounce, Brian's heart palpitating climaxes and Shon's envelope filter on bass…is this still *Postman*? **Early candidate for jams of the year!!!!** 

The hypnotic bass with synth accents summons *Gotta Save Fred*. Part B52s part Violent Femmes, this opus warns ""don’t look at him"", ""don’t talk to him"", ""and god bless you don’t touch him"", making me wonder what’s so wrong with Fred? My curiosity is sidetracked as oscillating helicopter blades and pulsating synth, pedaled effects and locomotive percussion from the engine room give us a POV from the dashcam of speed we are traveling down this desolate highway at dusk. I no longer worry about Fred. Around the 9 minute mark we hit cruise control and euphoria. The stars and moonlight are our only guide aside from the vehicle's high beams. Our attention and focus wanders as we've gotten comfortable with the pace and surroundings. There is a rhythm of this road and peacefulness to this jam we're on, almost guiding us without any friction or effort. Space, sky and horizon gradually blend and the segue to Demi Lovato's *Anyone* mimics the sonic parallel. The visuals continue with a spacious launch into more ethereal jamming consistent with the set. Dawn and the tones of orange and red begin to peer over the horizon, while the sky is still drenched in blues and violet. I'm reminded of the fulfillment of watching the incremental rise of the sun over the horizon to start the day. It brings out the flavor of the black coffee I sip, the slowness to which a moment and you can exist, devoid of technology. Sometimes best experienced alone, witness without announcement, but a communal experience with participants engaging without acknowledging. Living in *that* moment. The same feeling of live improvisational music, that simply deserves absorption; consuming without distraction. 

I felt the segue of this *Fred>Anyone* was transcendent and needs to be experienced as a single entity rather than individually. 

*Motel 6* is a fitting oasis on the heels of the the past 30 minutes. A triumphant closer that concludes our night and the final mile. We pull off our exit and night 2 is nearly in the books aside from what surely will be a short encore with teeth, right? 

Nope - *Run Like Hell* and its familiar guitar greets us. Pink Floyd is such a choice cover and influence you hear in so much of Cory and Brian's fabric, while Shon aptly nods to Roger Waters. This *Run* goes into a chill and relaxed deviation from the burned in our brain and in our sleep memories of this classic. By the 9 minute mark, we’ve teleported back to the same landscape that we experienced throughout set 2. Articulate and precise, the clean vibrant feel of this jam is apparent. We've got some terrain to cover before we conclude this bombastic show. The Hammond waltz funk that unfolds, as Brian reinserts himself via a watery tone, this is  exclamation and pulverizing the the final 2 minutes of a Run for the Hills return back into *Run Like Hell.* 

2 shows still remain to cover, but this might be my show of the Spaffski run thus far.

Basically I’ve always been a major introvert even if I crave social interaction at times. I suggested to my friends the other day if we could hang out since its summer and settled on a date. Great! Now I can take my time mentally preparing for it.

Then because a friend can’t make it, it suddenly gets rescheduled to be the VERY NEXT DAY. For some reason this stressed me the heck out. I could barely sleep and felt nauseous the whole night. 

Then the day comes and I do ok at first. Talking and joking as usual. We grab coffee and walk around. Then like two hours in I just kinda fizzled out. Wind got really loud, sun was way too bright, not to mention it was hot and I felt so grimy and sweaty. I kinda stopped talking and my friends kept asking why I was being so distant.

When I got home, I immediately took a shower and just conked out for like 6 hours straight. Woke up at 11 pm and STILL felt completely drained and overwhelmed. The nausea was back, I felt like throwing up, and my chest was tight.

I was really hungry but didn’t want to talk to anyone, so I waited for my family to go to bed before I went out to the kitchen. I had absolutely no appetite. Lights were way too bright and it was hard to breathe so I ended up just pacing around in the dark before curling up and rocking in the corner of the living room.

Then my mom came out and saw me just sitting there. I couldn’t think of an explanation because I really just wanted to be alone. Before I knew it I was crying and repeatedly asking her over and over to go back to her room.

She eventually agreed, but now I feel horrible because I basically just randomly started sobbing when she came out for a cup of water kicked her out of her own kitchen with no explanation.

I’ve suspected that I’m autistic before, but after getting diagnosed with ADHD I thought that was it. Now I’m starting to wonder if it might be both because wtf was that??

Dear You,

You told me today you are going to Bangalore during your summer break. I asked if I could tag along. Just that. A question, stupid and naked.

And you snapped.

“We are divorced for a reason,” you said. “If I am still spending my time with you, what’s the point of even ending it? I am 36, when do I get to move on, when do I find a new partner?”

Then the line went dead.

And it felt like something inside me finally matched the silence outside.

You were right. You have been right for a long time. And I have been dragging my dead weight through your life like an old suitcase with broken wheels. But that didn’t make it hurt any less.

Because you had once promised, through the cracks of the failing marriage, that after the divorce, we would still get coffee sometimes. Still catch a movie. Still laugh, if nothing else. That we would be the exception, not the mess. That you would still show up, even if you no longer stayed.

But life doesn’t owe me your promises. You don’t owe me anything. And I know it would be unfair to expect these things from you.

It’s just that I don’t know how to live with that.

I have no identity without you. I never did.
You weren’t just my partner. You were my person. My reason to wake up. My shelter. My mirror. My home. I guess… you still are.
I know I never could bring out that same feeling in you. And I am sorry. Truly.

You had others - friends, sisters, shoulders to lean on. I didn’t. I only had you. That’s why I count hours till 10 PM, waiting for those ten stolen minutes of conversation every night. That’s why I hold on harder than I should. That’s why I suffocate you, even when I try not to.

I can’t imagine walking into Truffles alone. Or sitting at Pizza Bakery without you across the table. Buying books at Blossom without your voice arguing about which Murakami to pick. Forum Mall. Orion. Oasis. Those places are haunted now.

I just wanted one more time. Not to fix anything. Not to restart. Just to be with you again. Just once. Because if I don’t… I don’t think I ever will. And I don’t know how to live with that.

I’m afraid. Really afraid.
Of turning into dust in a city we once called ours.

You know, one of my worst fears was always this: That I will stop saying, “I will see you at home,”
And start whispering, “When can I see you again?”

Now I live inside that fear.

You didn’t break me. I broke me. I broke us.

But even now, all I want is to sit beside you. Even if you don’t look at me. Even if you never speak again. Just for a while.
To remember I once belonged somewhere in this world.

I don’t want to write anything after this.

Because everything else would just feel like goodbye.

SBUX trades at ~25x forward earnings while comp sales have slowed. Global same-store sales missed in the last two quarters, yet the market still prices it like a high-growth tech-adjacent brand. That disconnect can’t last.

2. Labor Unrest = Structural Cost Risk:
Over 400 stores have voted to unionize, and ongoing resistance has become a reputational and financial drain. Labor costs are rising across the board, which will eat into margin — especially as promotional activity increases.

3. China Expansion Is Now a Liability:
China was once SBUX’s golden goose. Now, it’s facing aggressive competition from domestic players like Luckin and Cotti Coffee. Add geopolitical instability and post-COVID consumer shifts — it’s no longer a safe growth play.

4. ESG Red Flags:
Despite its branding, SBUX faces criticism over union-busting tactics, single-use waste, and farm labor practices. ESG funds may re-evaluate exposure.

5. Consumer Fatigue:
Gen Z is turning to local cafés, bubble tea, or even making coffee at home. Price hikes are hitting resistance. Rewards program growth has slowed.

I’m not saying it’s time to short, but this isn’t the defensive growth stock it used to be. Anyone else noticing this shift?

19F & 32M — Probably Sri Lanka’s Most Secret Age Gap Couple 😂



Hey everyone! First time posting here because honestly… where else can I talk about this without being totally judged? Especially since I live in Sri Lanka, where age gap couples like us are treated like UFO sightings 😅



So yeah... I’m 19, he’s 32. \*Cue the gasps\* We met at the gym last year. I was there pretending to be super into fitness (translation: sitting on a mat scrolling on my phone between fake stretches 😂), and he was actually serious about working out. We started talking, casually at first… and now here we are.



The real drama? Our relationship is so not normal for this country. People here raise eyebrows over a 4 year age gap so you can imagine what they’d say about 13 years. Which is why we’ve had to keep it low key. My classic excuse when we run into someone I know is, “Oh, he’s just my gym trainer!” (he’s not, lol). My parents have no clue. Only my closest friends know and thank goodness they’ve been supportive but I’ve also lost some friends who didn’t approve. Oh well. 🤷🏽‍♀️



But honestly? With him it just feels normal. We hang out all the time mostly at his apartment, just cooking, watching movies, or playing silly games. Or we’re in the car, driving around aimlessly for hours, talking and laughing. We do go out on the odd occasion for food or coffee, but always super low key and no PDA or hand holding because public affection here equals instant drama and judgment stares from strangers, specially from the eye rolling uncles and aunties 👀  Not worth the stress.



Sometimes it sucks having to hide and sneak around because of what people here might say but when it’s just us, everything feels easy, fun, and real.



Anyone else here secretly dating in a super traditional country? Please tell me I’m not the only one living this double life. 😂",18,1749659512.0,AgeGapRelationship,11,0.85,False

1l8x3g2,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1l8x3g2/through_the_woods/,Through The Woods,"I may have uncovered something that’ll send me on a trip through a forest. My friend and I are going to begin our search a week from now, so I’m here to detail what I found out, and how I found it. It all started some time back in January. I had recently returned home to my moms house after college, ( I had failed a course from the year earlier and had to retake that course in the fall), so I was finally back home. 

We were in this little town near Athabasca, just one of the dozens of lesser known towns here in Alberta, sure to be forgotten by the rest of our province if that’s not already the case. It was probably the first week of my return. I noticed one of the neighbours houses nearby had police tape strewn across it which wasn't there the last time I visited my mom on Thanksgiving. 

All I’ve ever known about those neighbours is that they were meth heads, consisting of some guy and his girlfriend, and another friend of theirs from the Northwest Territories. We never talked at all, so given the few stories my mom told me about them like how they stole the weed plant another neighbour grew or how the meth heads would park this RV of theirs in peoples yards without asking, I could gather that they were a bunch of weirdos whose days were numbered. 

Curious about what got the police to finally do them in, I went to ask my mom about what they did, the conversation going something like this; 

“Hey mom, why is there a bunch of police tape around the neighbours house?” 

“Oh? They killed someone.” I received as a brief answer. 

This surprised me, so wanting to know what else happened I asked something among the lines of, “Who’d they kill and why?” 

“I don't know. Police sirens woke me up one night, and I looked out the patio door to see the police arresting them and bringing a body bag out.” 

“Jesus, are you sure it wasn’t like, an overdose or something?” I remember asking. 

“Maybe, I don't know all that much. They were doing some strange things leading up to the arrest, I think I heard them digging and driving around town at night back in fall.” 

More questions came with all this new information, however, my mom had nothing else to say as that was all she knew. Still, my curiosity had now been peaked, and being bored and unsure what to do with my time, I wanted to figure out what happened. 

My personal investigation started, and unfortunately for me, this was a fresh case so anytime I’d try to look into something online there wouldn’t be much in the way of information about what happened. The only thing I could learn was how the guy from the Northwest Territories killed the other guy's girlfriend for some reason, and the boyfriend tried to help dispose of the body by storing her in a deep freeze, but they got caught somehow regardless. He may have also had a hand in her death because she was severely beaten and cut up, but the information wasn't conclusive. 

Learning all this disturbed me at the time, knowing how close the murder occured to my moms house and how recent this was. It felt kind of ghostly too, I never knew the neighbours all that well but I did see them and made small talk with them a couple times. Knowing what happened and seeing the house across the road, yeah.

Despite the slightly clearer picture of what happened, none of the information mentioned the digging or them driving around town. I first talked with my mom about it, asking where she heard the digging or where she saw them driving, but the only thing I learned was that they only had a rusty blue car that most people in town recognized, and that the digging came from the trees near our house. Snow blanketed the ground at this point of the year, so it wasn’t like I could just look for any signs of a hole at the moment. Regardless of this minor setback, I decided to look into them driving around town until the snow melted and the ground softened up. 

A few months went by with me going around town and occasionally talking to people about the meth heads. When I could, I’d just start up small talk with people here and there about the meth heads which was easy given this town's small population and their unruly reputation. 

Some of the stories I heard didn’t help that much, being just small things about how the meth heads would steal or inconvenience the people around town. Some of the stories, however, lined up with the fall events. Generally, people knew about the arrest, to the whole town it meant they didn't have these annoying people stealing or messing with things anymore. Only a select few actually noticed strange things in fall. There were a few stories about people noticing the meth heads driving around at night, and this one dude I met actually explained how he tried to observe what they were doing. 

He told me he was outside smoking at two in the morning for some reason when he noticed the meth head’s car driving around. It had only one of the meth heads in it, the guy from the Northwest Territories, and the dude telling me this story discreetly followed the car for a short distance before they went out of sight. After asking him which direction they drove, he gave me his best recollection of where the car went. 

Ignoring why he followed them and now having a lead, I went to the area the car reportedly drove through. I took my time looking for someone who may have seen them that night, and it didn't take long for me to do so. There was this little house I passed by that an older lady lived in, Mary. She’s a sweet old lady, and my mom and I actually helped with her garden last summer. I knew the meth heads had to have done something here because this little public library she had next to the sidewalk was destroyed. It was this little wooden box that had a “take one leave one” system for books in her front yard, and it was unfortunately smashed. Its wreckage laid depressingly next to her fence, a little sign in its old place saying, “Public library closed”. 

I knocked on her door, Mary answering with a happy smile. 

“Oh hello, I didn't know you were back in town.” 

“Hey Mary, I’m back. How's things?” I replied, setting aside my investigation momentarily to enjoy a moment with her. 

“I’ve been living well, even with all the snow. How are you?” 

“Surviving. I was passing by and I noticed that your public library was broken, what happened?” 

I think she looked over at it sadly, taking a moment to think before saying, “Oh, do you know your neighbours?” 

“The meth heads?” 

“Yes, them. One of them, the religious one I think, broke it.” 

Happy that I got some confirmation that this was them, I asked, “Why did he break it? Was he just driving by some afternoon and decided to break it?” 

“Oh no… I was sleeping when I woke up to a noise as it was still dark out. I wanted to see what the ruckus was and got out of bed to look, and there was that man out there stomping the door of the box open.” 

“Isn’t that thing always unlocked?” 

“It is. He had no need to break it open but it did. He grabbed some books out of there and drove away. Now, I didn't call the police because I have enough worries in life and the books were free anyway, but I’ll have to make a new library one of these days. If you wanted one of the books from there I can grab one for you.” 

If the meth head stole multiple books, maybe there was a theme with them that mattered. She did say he was religious. 

Thinking this,  asked, “What kind of books did you have in there?” 

“Oh, I had a variety of books. There were some kids books but I don't think you’d want those. I also had these adventure books and Native American books, they were good reads but the Native ones were taken. He left the bibles I had in there, I was sure he would have taken them as a religious man, but he shouldn't have taken anything at all if he was.” 

“Huh. Sorry, but none of those are for me. I hope you're able to fix your public library though, shame some people are out of their minds these days.” 

“It is a real shame, thanks for stopping by.” 

After our chat, I left to continue my investigation. Unforunately, nothing else came up for a while. More weeks passed as I tried to piece together what their drive amounted to besides the book theft. Things went cold, and I slowly drifted away from the investigation as I stopped learning new things, on top of not being able to do much with finding the hole in the snow. That was, until I was at the local 24 hour gas station. 

The clerk was named Terrance, the night shift clerk, and we both knew each other on a first name basis. We would chat whenever I stopped by to get drinks, and on this one early morning I was there for an energy drink. Terrance was still on the night shift hours, and during our conversation he said something like, “You know, that's the same drink the meth addict would buy all the time.” 

This perked me up, my investigation coming back to me. 

“Did they ever come by in the fall? Like, around the time that Mary’s public library was broken?” I inquired. 

“I did have a weird ass encounter with one of them around then, how'd you know?” 

“I’ve been trying to figure out why they were doing some weird stuff around my house. Did the one from the Northwest Territories drop in the same night he broke Mary’s library?” 

“I don’t know if it was the same night, but I think the addict you’re talking about did come in to get an energy drink at 4 am. He did some strange stuff when he stopped by.” 

“Like what?” 

Terrance took a moment to recall the night, eventually saying, “He was all twitchy, scratching his arms and staggering around, the usual methed up stuff. After stumbling around like a jackass and knocking stuff over, he finally found the fridge with drinks and he grabbed an energy drink. He did some weird shit where he breathed on the glass door and marked some odd, star-like sigil in the condensation.” 

“Why?” 

“I dont know, I didn’t ask. He was probably just fucked up.” 

“Could you draw out what it looked like?” I requested. 

“Sure, why not.” 

After our talk, he drew out this sigil, at least a vague recreation from his memory for me. I took it home to try and figure out what it could mean while I waited for the snow to melt and ground to soften. The best I could come up with, given my perception of what the rattled mind of a druggy who would later become a murderer could think, was that the sigil was used for marking things of importance. It’s the best I could theorize given the brief interaction Terrance had. 

Later on in mid April when the snow was finally gone and I could actually work on looking for the spot the meth head was digging, I grabbed a shovel and began to search the trees near my moms side of the house. Sigil in hand, I searched the general, checking around for something marked with a similar sigil. I checked living trees, fallen trees, rocks, whatever could have something drawn on them. Sure enough, after an hour or so of searching, I finally found a little sigil carved into the base of a tree. The sigil Terrance drew wasn’t dead accurate to the sigil I found, but they were similar enough for me to assume the meth head made it. 

It didn't take long for me to dig the area up, finding a plastic garbage bag beneath all the dirt. I remember being worried for a moment, thinking that there would be a body part in there. Opening the bag, I found nothing of the sort, rather, I found a plastic baggy with crystals in it (I could assume what those were), a surprisingly small amount of money which was just a wad of $30 in $5 bills that I pocketed (Not sure why he’d hide that low amount of cash), and a note book full of nonsense. It was one of those small, pocket sized notebooks with the majority of the pages ripped out. What few pages that were left contained a bunch of nonsensical ramblings. 

The best way I could describe the ramblings was the writer jotting down events or thoughts of theirs, before immediately stopping and changing the direction of whatever he was writing. The best example of this were these sentences talking about shine in the trees and those who guard it, before switching to the fear of the girlfriend knowing about the provinces serenity and wanting to steal it, then switching to rambling of the weighted bag and sparkles of the water, whatever the Hell that could’ve been.

At the time, it kinda freaked me out, just getting a vague look into the mind of a drugged out guy who would soon be involved with a murder, but it was over. I found out why the guy was driving around at night, and what was hidden in a hole he dug. That was, until Easter Sunday came around. 

My friend Wyatt had finished his last college course a week before so I invited him out to the town to hang out, drink some beer together, and just enjoy Easter. The two of us were drinking and talking, and of course the topic of the meth heads came up. I explained what happened and what I had found, and we talked about what all this could possibly mean. A few beers later, and we were then looking at the taped off house across the street from us,  and discussing searching it. 

I’d never seen any police enter the house since I’ve moved back, and motivated by liquor and the thirst for adventure, we decided to break in. We grabbed flashlights, knives and a wood cutting axe just in case we had to defend ourselves, gloves to hide our fingerprints, and we both dawned a couple bandanas over our face just in case anyone saw us enter it. It was dark out so it was unlikely, but we were paranoid about being caught doing dumb stuff while drunk. 

We snuck over to the house, crouching under the police tape and approaching the front door. It was locked, of course, so we entered the back yard. Obviously, the back door was also locked, but it was worth checking just in case. We figured we had to find an unlocked window, which was surprisingly easy to do since we managed to find a window that was already broken open. The majority of the glass was outside so we figured the meth heads smashed it from the inside, maybe when the murder took place. 

The window led into the bathroom which looked to be in terrible condition. The elements had taken its toll on the interior of the bathroom, but I’m confident it was already wrecked way before being exposed to the outdoors. Dozens of shampoo bottles and empty toilet paper rolls riddled the ground, a small mountain of them resting in the corner. Mold was along the shower wall, decorating it in a revolting black pattern. Various brown colours of grime had crawlen around different parts of the bathroom, especially the sink area. There were obvious signs of both spiders and ants taking up residence in the corners of this bathroom, fortunately there weren’t any signs of life at the moment. The mirror was broken, and what looked like lipstick was used to write something on the mirror before it was shattered. Upon entering the bathroom, the two of us looked at the shards in the sink, piecing together the word, “Serenity”. 

Upon seeing that and remembering the notebook I found, I said something like, “You think that's about the girlfriend or just from some kind of drug hallucination?” 

“I don't know, these guys seem nuts. Do you think they broke the mirror and window when the murder happened.” 

“Probably.” 

The bathroom door was shut, so we opened it, entering the hall of the house. Almost immediately this rotten smell hit me, my bandana doing its best to help me breathe. Darkness consumed the entirety of this house, our lights breaking it apart as we trekked over the garbage piled up around us. Every room we passed by had heaps of worthless junk piled into small mountains, a gross mark of this being a hoarders home.

Wyatt, being the braver of us two, went ahead first. He had the axe cocked back as he walked down the hall in the direction of the living room, him uttering something like, “What the fuck dude…”, upon entering. Entering the living room after him, I was stunned too. 

Off to my right side was the kitchen which was attached to the living room. Rotten food was placed on the counters, and a bunch of garbage was overflowing from this trashcan that hadn't been emptied in God knows how long. All the drawers and cabinets were open, the contents dumped onto the ground into one pile of ceramic shards and unclean cutlery. The kitchen sink had a massive pile of rotting dishes and a water puddle stain around the floor near it. A table was flipped onto its side, one of the chairs next to it broken with what I assumed to be dried blood splattered along one of the broken legs. 

When I turned to my left to see what the rest of the living room was like, I could see the couch, coffee table, TV, and more piles of useless junk and garbage. Each step we took into the living room crunched plastic bags beneath our boots or rolled empty bottles around. The furniture in the living room was shifted around at awkward angles, as if they got shoved around in a scuffle. A bunch of books and ripped up papers were spread around the living room, some pages from the books taped along the walls. 

I didn't care about those though, I was focused on the dozens of pieces of papers taped to the walls instead. Spread across the walls of the living room were scribbled drawings and insane notes, similar to the ramblings I found buried in the notebook. It was more unhinged stuff, talking about the weighted bags or the shine hidden and guardians in the trees. There were some foreboding notes that were likely made before the murder, and I could tell because they were written like, “She’ll harm serenity” or “It must stay there”. Some of the pieces of paper came from the same notebook I found containing similar ramblings I’ve seen, however some of the bigger pieces of paper taped on the walls had some new material I hadn’t encountered. 

These new pieces of paper were art, drawings. They weren't well made by any means, each was hastily drawn in pencil and were made up of messy lines intertwined to form silhouettes of whatever was being presented. A few were poorly made sketches of some character waving, some were of spiders, a couple were of some lanky dude, etc, just a bunch of random shit. 

The only thing that stood out to me were these drawings that seemed to be connected. They were the only ones that were taped to the wall next to each other, and they seemed to form a location that was probably important to the meth head. It was this hastily drawn picture of a house, some arrangements of wobbly lines which Wyatt somehow realized was a map of our country's Western provinces with landmarks and the same sigil I’d seen before. There were also some notes saying things like, “Serenity stays here”. 

Wyatt and I grabbed these drawings, taking them with us as we left to discuss what this all meant. Little progress was made that night in our drunken haze, but the next day we started on figuring out what all this meant. It was a rough map with a sigil that the meth head used to mark things important to him, so we could assume something was there, likely a cabin. Based on the province borders, even with how terribly they were drawn, it looked like this cabin was located in the Northwest Territories, the same province the religious meth head was from. There were a few landmarks aside from the sigil, likely roads, rivers, mountains, and possible towns. 

As to what was in the cabin, we don’t know. We spent the day trying to figure out where the sigil marked and what was in the cabin, and we never came up with a definitive answer for either. The best we could make out was the mountains of the Nahanni National Park which had a history of gold panning in the rivers there, and with that, we guessed that the “weighted bag” and “shine of the woods” was gold, likely stored in the cabin. Like, maybe a lot of gold, perhaps enough for us both to make a handsome profit off of.

We just needed to figure out how to get to the cabin and where it could be located, and we didn't figure it out for around a month of us both trying to analyze these terribly drawn landmarks and comparing them to google maps. Our verdict was that the cabin was built alongside a river South-West of the Camsell Bend. If we were to drive up to the village of Fort Simpson and follow the Mackenzie River upstream until we reached the bend, we could continue the journey on foot, following the river until we reached the cabin where there would be gold free for the taking. 

Now, I know it may belong to the meth head, but he's a murderer, it's not like he needs it anymore or deserves it. The cabin also may not even exist, but we’d be surrounded by beautiful untouched forests and cliffs, so if there is no gold it’ll just be a fun trip for the two of us to explore and camp in an amazing forest. 

Wyatt was concerned about the notes talking about those who guard the shine or whatever, and being from a hunting family he wants to take some of his guns along with us. I was worried about the extra weight, but two guns couldn't hurt. We could come across a grizzly or cougar afterall, as rare as those attacks are. 

We’re dead set on doing this, taking a short vacation to drive up to Fort Simpson and hike our way to get some meth heads gold. I do have concerns regarding some folklore I heard about the valley and people who sought gold there in the past, but that was all decades ago and I’m sure whatever murderer there has long since passed. Wyatt told me it could be supernatural, but I don't believe it due to the lack of definitive proof of indigenous demons or the wendigo or whatever else could be haunting the woods. 

So yeah, soon we’ll head up to this supposedly haunted valley based on some clues we got from a murderer. Is it greedy? Yeah. Will it be fun for us? Definitely. I'll probably provide you all an update on what happens when it’s all over. Peace.

Last night, I fell down an anxiety-fueled rabbit hole comparing Wattpad Originals, Inkitt/Galatea, and the pros and cons of self-publishing vs. traditional publishing.

From what I gathered - through articles and Reddit threads - it seems *Wattpad Originals and Galatea authors earn very little and have limited creative control*. That was disheartening, especially since it’s been my dream to “make it” on Wattpad since I was 13. 🥲

I also realized traditional publishing can take years (if you’re lucky enough to get picked up), while self-publishing offers more control - but only if you can write quickly, market well, and accept that most authors still barely earn “coffee money.”

So, I’m curious: 

**Has anyone here had personal experience with any of these options?** 

Is Wattpad Originals worth pursuing, or should I shift focus to eventually self-publishing?

This guide is based on my personal observations and comparisons with English. While some of the points are a bit advanced and aren't necessarily taught right away, you will eventually run into points 1 and 2 — and probably reach the others sooner or later in your Polish learning journey.

Here it is:

1. **Nothing is urgent, so start your sentence with** ***no***... and take your time. *Co nagle, to po diable*\*. Give your brain a moment or two to collect your thoughts, and stretch your ***no*** as much as you like.
2. **Again, no need to hurry.** If you can't think of something relevant, complement your ***no*** with some good Polish fillers like ***yyy***. If you're unsure how to use it, look up some interviews with Leszek Miller.
3. **Be a good chap and greet your colleague or family member with a slight rant, complaint, or general life disappointment.** No one has time for small talk, so no *How are you?*, please. (If you do ask that, expect a rant about things going wrong—people will be very honest.) A negative comment about the Polish national football team's performance last night will do just fine. To magnify your opinion, you can start with *Ale*, as in: *Ale dzisiaj zimno!* \[‘Boy, it’s cold today!’\].
4. **Be mindful of others' need to reflect on the meaning of life by using void phrases that don't mean much, but always work.** For example, ***święta, święta i po świętach****\*\** is an unwritten Polish tradition; ***skleroza nie boli****\*\*\** is a valid instance of self-diagnosis, and ***młodość, nie wieczność****\*\*\*\** is a deep reflection on the frailty of human life.
5. **Downplay achievements and compliments.** Whenever your friend or coworker compliments you on a recent achievement or piece of clothing, you need to tone it down. You can say: *Eee tam, nie ma o czym mówić* \[‘Nah, nothing to talk about’\], *z wyprzedaży* \[‘Bought on sale’\], or acknowledge your modesty and inability to brag publicly by saying: *Udało mi się* \[‘I got lucky’\].
6. **Make everything small and cute.** Polish speakers love to use diminutives to express their emotional attitude toward people and things, which is why they get excited about getting coffee – *kawusia* (vs. *kawa*) or tea – *herbatka* (vs. *herbata*), or going to a party – *imprezka* (vs. *impreza*), etc.

Translations:

* \* 'Good and quickly seldom meet'

I made my way first to the University of Lorestan (the old barracks building) on foot, hoping to see Mahshid there. The university was bustling, and students and faculty from the basic sciences, especially the English and Physics departments, were flocking up the steps and the cobbled path to the fortress.

Later, when I remembered that Mahshid was the translator for the group of scientists and astronauts, I was thrilled and proud of her.

I immediately made my way through the towering trees, the trout pond, the duck and goose pond, the Golestan spring, and among the students and faculty to the rooftop of the celestial fortress, ""Ghaleh Rafie,"" and there, for the first and last time, I met Colonel Neil Armstrong (the one who made Jules Verne's dream of traveling to the moon a reality). Of course, thanks to my sister Mahshid, I was also able to speak with Neil for a few moments and learn new things from this well-traveled man.

Mahshid was the host of the program and also responsible for the translation. First, one of the scientists went behind the podium and, showing many pictures and slides on the monitor, gave explanations to the audience about the stars, planets, moon, sun, and Earth. Then, when it was time to announce Neil Armstrong's name, Mahshid said, ""Little Prince, welcome to the planet of poppies!""

Mahshid's reference to the Little Prince was Neil Armstrong himself, whose face was marked by the signs of aging, and her reference to the planet of poppies was both the world Mahshid had created inspired by her dream and Lorestan province, which is known as the planet of poppies. Then she continued, ""In Antoine de Saint-Exupéry's 'The Little Prince,' we read that when the Little Prince lands on Earth, he says that he owns asteroid B-612 in the starry sky and has a flower there that constantly complains to him. A flower that he has tamed himself; he watered it during the day and took care of it at night against the severe cold, and he did not allow any birds or animals to get close to his flower. When someone loves you and cherishes you, it means they have become tamed by you, and when you love someone, know that you have become tamed by them, and if you are always in love like a poppy flower, all the better... We have not set foot on the moon, but Neil says that from there, a planet is visible called the 'Planet of Poppies,' where the lives of its people depend on these same poppies, and their heartfelt belief is that as long as there are poppies, life must go on.""

Which was met with applause from the audience, and she invited Neil to come to the podium. I was happy that after his separation, he had now reached his heart's desire.

When Neil came behind the podium, I thought to myself, ""Could it be that he has come here to boast to us about his moon, the moon he himself conquered, and say, 'Do you see how my moon has stepped in front of your sun?!'""

But when he greeted the audience with a smile and respect, in Persian, ""Salaam,"" and said, ""This is the land of poppies, bronze, and oak,"" I realized that Mahshid's words about him were true, and he had set foot on this land and planet without any pretense. And instead, I have to search for a veiled girl in my own city and country.

At the end of his speech, Neil said, ""A trip to the moon is a giant leap for mankind and a small step for a man.""

I thought to myself, what a profound and meaningful sentence! A giant leap for mankind and a small step for a man?!

After the speech ended, everyone watched the solar eclipse with their special instruments, and I leaned against the parapet of the rooftop of the celestial fortress and gazed at the silent city. Then I saw the city gradually light up, revealing its white, black, velvet, and golden mountains, and the ancient artifacts suddenly emerged from the earth, further increasing my enthusiasm. But from the vantage point where I was viewing the city, one spot remained in darkness—namely, the Roads and Transportation Department (the old Roads and Highways Department), which was the location I had in mind for building the Baghe Mafregh.

After the ceremony and the end of the solar eclipse, which lasted about an hour, the team of astronauts and scientists, led by Mahshid. We visited the museum of the fortress, and through the labyrinthine corridors, I traveled to the past and distant and near centuries, especially the Sasanian, Al-e Buyeh, Deylamiyan, Seljuk, Safavid, Qajar, and Pahlavi periods. My father once told me that because my grandfather was in the military, he was able to witness the events of the August 19th coup through one of these windows, and how the fate of a country was changed by hoodlums in a single morning and evening.

In addition, when I opened the windows of the fortress rooms, I was faced with new cityscapes, and new horizons opened up in my mind. Perhaps it was there that I became determined to carry out the idea I had been nurturing. Or perhaps it was the female students of Lorestan University who, with their strange outfits and appearances on the rooftop, constantly turning around 360 degrees behind their Chinese telescopes, boasting to everyone, and trying to show off in contrast to the simply dressed, blonde, blue-eyed foreign female students who had come here. I really wanted to know what they were seeing through the lenses of their telescopes that I couldn't see.

It was there that I said to myself and to them, ""Soon you will have to watch my Baghe Mafregh, and all of you will be speechless.""

Then black clouds gathered, and rain lashed down, and everyone took refuge in a corner of the fortress and found shelter under an alcove. Mahshid and I escorted Neil Armstrong and his entourage to the ""Hotel Shaghayegh,"" and wet and rained on, we returned home. My parents were waiting for us on the porch, standing and wanting to know the details of that day's events, to which I replied, ""What I saw there was that the governor himself came among the teachers and retirees and promised to help resolve their problems during the recent trip of the president and ministers to the province.""

And Mahshid responded about that young man like this: ""One shouldn't simply pay attention to every rumor, but certainly, there is a girl involved.""

Then Mahshid went to her bedroom, perhaps to see a new dream, and I went to the bathroom. After a nice hot shower and putting on new clothes, I resolved to start a new project. Exactly when I was applying cream to my face and blow-drying my hair, while facing the full-length mirror of the room, I heard the grandfather clock, and again that familiar morning voice echoed in my ear, saying, ""There is an angel caught in the rocks that you must save!""

This very voice became the motivation and stimulus for starting my daily work as a sculptor. A voice that wouldn't let me give up working or quit; a voice sometimes with the tenderness and love of a mother, and sometimes with the awe and authority of a father. Of course, my mother's words were also influential: ""My son, you are in a historical turning point, so create so that you may be known!"" But the truth is, I didn't create sculptures to be seen; I created sculptures so that I could see her through them. By the way, am I creating, therefore I am? Or am I, therefore I create?

Finally, after much research and study of the works of Mr. Faridoon Ghasemi, Hamid Izadpanah, Peter Calmeyer, and Roman Ghirshman, and being influenced by the Lorestan bronze sculptures in the Falak-ol-Aflak Castle Museum, Reza Abbasi Museum, Iran Bastan Museum, Louvre Museum, British Museum, and Metropolitan Museum, and visiting the Kaldar Cave, Kogan Cave, and Kalmakareh Cave, and the opportunities that Mr. and Mrs. Afshar, the esteemed painting and sculpture teachers of our city, opened up for me (during several sessions on the veranda of Khanomian's house, in the city's cafes, on the rooftop of the castle, and around the Keiyo Lake), I decided to create sculptures not in their actual scale and size, but in their enlarged and magnified forms.

It would have been a shame if these sculptures were not seen and brought to life on a larger scale. In my opinion, the only way for these sculptures to be seen was to exaggerate them and present them in a surreal way while preserving the original shape of the work. I thought to myself, perhaps these valuable sculptures will never be returned to Iran, or no one will be able to see them up close. I wanted to use this historical turning point to be seen and to share what was going on inside me with the people of the city. The points and explanations that Mr. and Mrs. Afshar elaborated for me made me realize the value and significance of the bronze sculptures even more, and they analyzed the inscriptions on the bronzes from new perspectives. Apart from creating bronze sculptures, which itself was a difficult and exhausting task, I first had to obtain permission from the Cultural Heritage Organization and the municipality, which I considered to be the most difficult stage of my work: obtaining the permit and providing a suitable space for installing the busts and statues. When I visited those places, they initially laughed at my idea or ignored me. Apart from the ""Baghe Mafregh"" idea, I also proposed the ""Bagheshahr"" (City Garden) idea to give a new life to my birthplace, Khorramabad, this living museum. Indeed, my ambition was getting the better of me. In fact, I wanted to suddenly transform the city into what I had in mind.

In the past, Khorramabad was a city in the middle of a dense forest. A dark city due to the numerous gardens like Golestan Garden, Dokhtaran Garden, and Keshavarzi Garden, and family gardens that cast their shadows over the city, and bright due to the gushing springs like Cheshmeh Araz, Cheshmeh Golestan, Sarab-e Shahabad, Sarab-e Keiyo, Girdab-e Sangi, Girdab-e Maliyeh; in fact, a Venice in the middle of the forest!

I was not a willow to tremble with these winds. Once an idea takes hold in my mind, I don't give up until I execute it.

When I found myself surrounded by the employees and staff of the Cultural Heritage Organization and the municipality who were mocking me, I didn't hesitate and loudly shouted at them, ""The siege of cities by land grabbers!""

Hearing this sentence, they said no more and each retreated to a corner. My words were not an insult to any particular group, I just wanted to tell them that they were not in their right place and that they should entrust the work to experts and professionals.

Father was on the porch collecting my mother's waste paper when he said, ""Son, work requires calculation and planning; you shouldn't have just rushed in like that! Besides, you shouldn't have spoken to them in such a way and with such language. This was a slogan of Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese communists. But it seems the fire spread to our city. 

A blacksmith in Balkh sinned, 

and in Shushtar they beheaded a coppersmith.""

My mother put her glasses on, inserted new sheets into her typewriter, and said, ""I wish instead of their slogans, they would send us silk and brocade fabrics, embroidered curtains, and dolls and puppets.""

I didn't even understand what they were saying. It was as if they were speaking in Yahong and Mahong languages. For a moment, I thought I had entered an unfamiliar city like the Forbidden City, the City of Ghosts, Dogville, or to be precise, a crazy town. I don't know, maybe it's because I haven't left the house for a long time and I'm unfamiliar with this kind of language... It feels like I've been asleep for three hundred years like the Companions of the Cave.

I thought to myself, but now that I'm awake, I want to build a metal wall in front of them.

When my mother saw me in that state, she said, ""Behrameshid is a butterfly whose wing flap can cause a storm on the other side of the city."" And then she wrote ""Butterfly Effect"" on the leaves in the copperplate style and drew a butterfly next to it and stuck it on the window. Father also put on his clothes, threw his coat over his shoulders, and said to me, ""Come on, let's go see what their point is!""

I had never seen Father like this before; neither his way of dressing nor his way of speaking. He has a certain discipline and always appears outside the house looking like Sherlock Holmes, but this time he appeared in the guise of a velvet-capped character, Fil-e Farsi. After the incident of the gypsum dragon carving in the room, which I erased without Father's permission and replaced with a Simorgh carving of my own choosing, we didn't interact much and were quite distant. I had sworn never to go near creating artistic works, but this time Father didn't want to abandon me.

Before entering the Cultural Heritage Organization and the municipality, he asked me to drink a sip of water from the ""Golestan Spring"" and the ""Ab-e Araz"" fountain, which were located at the entrance of both buildings, both to benefit from their miraculous properties and to control my nerves. He also freshened his face and recited a Fatiha for his deceased parents.

By good fortune, several old employees of the Cultural Heritage Organization, especially the mayor at the time, recognized Father, and as soon as they saw him, they stood up and greeted him warmly. They fully welcomed my idea, which was essentially to restore a part of the past concept and identity of Khorramabad city, and on my suggestion, they issued an order to demolish The same abandoned building that was located opposite the city park, so that the ""Baghe Mafregh"" that I dreamed of could be built in its place.

Another stroke of luck was that the inner courtyard of that abandoned building was full of centuries-old, sky-high trees such as elm, boxwood, poplar, cypress, spruce, mulberry, and alder... In addition to a turquoise pond that had previously been fed by the clear water of the Golestan spring and had now turned into a muddy puddle. The garden only needed some care, which my parents undertook with the help of friends, companions, neighbors, and acquaintances.

Father's team pruned the trees and removed the weeds with pesticide, and like Edward Scissorhands, they shaped the myrtles, boxwoods, cypresses, and pines into geometric shapes or birds according to their natural forms. And Father himself, like Geppetto, carved wooden statues of animals like eagles and cheetahs from the dry tree trunks according to his own taste.

But my mother's team first emptied the pond and cleaned out the mud, silt, and dry leaves in the pond, polished it, painted it, and by pumping water up and down several times, allowed the clear water of the Golestan spring to flow into it again. Finally, they released several goldfish into it, and filled the garden around the pond with fragrant and colorful flowers like Hasan-e Yusuf, Shah Pasand, Atlas, geranium, and colorful varieties of Gol-e Sinereh.

I told them I wanted to build a garden, unlike other gardens that have fences and walls, so that anyone could enter the garden from any direction they wished.

My work plan was that every morning at a specific time, after a recurring nightmare in which I was sacrificed by my father, I would wake up by the turquoise pond in our yard with cries of distress, and in unison with the voice that echoed in my ear, I would say, ""There is an angel caught in the rocks that must be saved.""

Then I would go to the curtains and the window, draw the curtains aside, and open the window. After watching the penthouse of the opposite apartment building and the long-haired girl next door, who, as always, appeared in her rural girl's pinafore dress, I would dive into the yard like a butterfly swimmer, and without washing my face or eating breakfast, I would tiptoe in harmony with the voice in my ear towards my sculpting workshop in the basement and begin chipping, hammering, filing, and polishing. After a few minutes, I would stop working because I had a more important task. I would have breakfast on the porch with my parents and then go to the Baghe Mafregh, the dream of which I was nurturing.

Father said, ""Behrameshid, by building the Baghe Mafregh, is going to take us to The Bronze Age.

My mother laughed and replied, ""No, it's not like that. We are now living in the Stone Age.""

After finishing my work, Father said, ""Behrameshid didn't really do anything except remove the walls. We did the main work.""

My mother angrily replied, ""What?! My son's artistry wasn't worth much? If it weren't for Behrameshid, that part of the city would have remained in darkness forever.""

My mother is right; when you look at the city from the city walls, apart from the Falak-ol-Aflak Castle that shines like a jewel in the heart of the night with its very eye-catching lighting, my four-season garden also displays itself in the color of each season; green, red, yellow, and blue... Everything worked together so that, as my mother said, I could show off my artistry to everyone. A garden full of strange and bizarre creatures, idols, and various colorful shapes.

Father laughed and said, ""Behrameshid's garden is more like a zoo than a Baghe Mafregh.""

My mother replied, ""If this garden (temple) were built in India and China, there would be as many idol worshippers as you could wish for, and women and girls would be making vows to these statues.""

And she began to recite poetry: The nightingale will pass by the flower when it sees me in the garden, Who would worship idols if they saw a Brahmin like me? And she continued: If the idol-worshippers of China see your face as an idol, They will all regret their idol-worship.

In reality, I created the sculptures single-handedly, but Mr. Alireza Afshar supervised the manner and creation of the sculptures full-time. And Mahshid, who was a painting student at the Niloufar Irani Gallery, sometimes visited me and Mr. Afshar every now and then with her team and entourage, whom I had nicknamed the ""Sicilian Mafia,"" to offer encouragement and support.

On their team's side, under the supervision and guidance of Mrs. Afshar and the magical hands of Anahita Afshar, they had undertaken the restoration and renovation of the Saqqakhanes (public drinking fountains) of ""Baghe Dokhtaran"" which was located on the other side of the river and they were preparing for the ""Chehel Monbar"" (forty pulpits) ceremony.

Their team was working on the design, coloring, calligraphy, painting, illumination, gilding, mirrorwork, and inlaying of the latticed surfaces of the Saqqakhane shrines.

Father said, ""In the past, the architecture, tiling, brickwork, mirror work, stucco, muqarnas, girih, and inlay work of the Saqqakhanes of Baghe Dokhtaran were done by a group of architects and master craftsmen from Khorramabad, Borujerd, Malayer, and Nahavand.""

My mother said, ""God bless my late father, who was an architect, and with the help of the golrizha (those who sprinkle rosewater), golkarha (flower makers), gachborha (stucco carvers), and gachkarha (stucco workers) of the city, how skillfully they made the Saqqakhanes."" Mahshid and her team and entourage usually came there in the afternoons, with baskets and trays full of cakes, cookies, blackberries, strawberries, and seasonal fruits, plus pitchers full of lemonade and mulberry juice, and flasks full of tea and coffee. On the other hand, the volume and size of the bronze sculptures that were to be made were very large, and on the other hand, my sculpting workshop, which was located in the basement of our house, could not accommodate them. For this reason, and on Mr. Afshar's suggestion, we set up my sculpting workshop right there in a corner of the garden.

Mr. Afshar said, ""This way, the people of the city will become familiar with the process and manner of making the sculptures, and they will appreciate them more.""

The volume of work was very high, and several stages had to be gone through to create each sculpture.

1 Silicone mold making for the wax model 

2 Wax pouring 

3 Making ceramic mold for the wax model 

4 Casting 

5 Finishing 

6 Welding 

7 Patina application

And for some sculptures: 

1 Armature 

2 Concrete pouring 

3 Painting

I spent one spring, one summer, one autumn, and one winter creating my bronze sculptures, and I knew no day or night, cold or heat.

Every bust or statue that was finished was immediately installed on a specially designed platform, and a curtain was drawn over it.

My mother laughed and said, ""Sometimes I think Behrameshid himself is a mixture of tin and copper.""

And Father somewhat completed her sentence and said, ""I sometimes think to myself, could it be that Behrameshid's bone structure is made of rebar and his flesh of cement? By the way, Shidrokh, during your pregnancy, did you crave tin and copper or rebar and cement?""

And then they both burst into laughter, and I laughed and said to them, ""Soon the curtains will be drawn aside, and the secrets and mysteries of the sculptures will be revealed, and the structure and physiology of myself will also become clear to you.""

There is a conversation between you and me behind the curtain, 

If the curtains fall, neither you nor I will remain.

On the other side of the matter, Mahshid's team and entourage in the Girls' Garden, with the magic of Anahita Afshar's hands and Mrs. Afshar's supervision, were hard at work bringing life and beauty to the Girls' Garden Saqqakhanes.We were somehow drawn into an unwanted competition with each other.

My mother said, ""It's like the painting competition between the Chinese and the Romans.""

And she continued: 

The Chinese said, ""We are the painters,"" 

the Romans said, ""We have elegance and grandeur."" 

Father said, ""In the end, we didn't understand which group was Chinese and which was Roman.""

And he continued: 

When the people of China and Rome gathered, 

The Romans were more knowledgeable in science.

Every day after finishing my work, I would first quench my thirst with Golestan water and then take a good dip in the turquoise pond. I would swim from one end of the pond to the other like a butterfly just emerging from its chrysalis. After finishing my day's work, to avoid drifting away from my goal and purpose and to maintain my feelings, I would secretly visit the vicinity and surroundings of the Girls' Garden at night, and I would often recite a poem:

In your hidden days, 

you must light a lamp, 

I do not deserve silence. 

I have only taken two or three oranges as spoils in the garden. 

The heavy morning mist steals my simple sense, 

I lose the branch, 

The mirror is from you, 

I brought the Quran in the rain.

Mahshid said that the forty girls would also go for the fruits after their work in the Girls' Garden was finished, and they would pick as many fruits from the garden as their strength and the reach of their hands would allow; apples, pears, cherries, sour cherries, raspberries, strawberries, pomegranates, and oranges... and they would fill their bags and, according to their age, their baskets with fruit.

Interestingly, the girls of the Niloufar Irani Gallery, based on their own whims, gave made-up names to my bronze sculptures, which had international fame and recognition. For example, the bronze ""Circular Standard"" which was in the Louvre Museum and had been chosen as the emblem and logo of Bursa, Tehran since 1968, they had named ""Tree of Life"".

A bronze sculpture with a ram accompanied by six ducks around its wheel, four dancing men holding handkerchiefs and performing a local dance inside its wheel, two bulls supporting the wheel on their horns, and a man and a woman holding hands with the entire wheel between their hands.

Each of the parts and forms of the sculptures I made is full of mystery and symbolism. For example, in the bronze Circular Standard, the ram on top of the wheel symbolizes power, its horns symbolize the crescent moon and the descent of rain, the six ducks around the wheel symbolize immortality, the four men who are performing a local dance - if their dance is considered clockwise, it signifies a mourning dance, and if counterclockwise, it signifies a celebration and wedding dance. The two horned bulls, according to past beliefs, supported the earth on their horns, and the man and woman can be likened to Mashyo and Mashyaneh.

During the month that this bronze statue was brought from the Louvre Museum to the Iran Bastan Museum and put on display, Mr. Afshar and I took ourselves to Tehran to see it up close, and during the visit, Mr. Afshar gave explanations about it to the audience, especially to the French ambassador, which left us all in awe.

A fascinating suggestion Anahita Afshar made was to postpone the demolition of the old building that once housed the Lorestan and Khuzestan Roads and Highways Department, dated 1320, until the opening day. And jokingly, she said the password should be ""Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!""

And by Mr. Gorbachev she meant me, who had no political agenda or approach and whose only goal was to create and produce works of art and nothing else! When Anahita said this sentence, I was initially taken aback and thought she must have some knowledge of my inner thoughts, but then I thought to myself, maybe she said this sentence by chance.

She said ""tear down this wall"" as if this wall was the Berlin Wall. Her idea was interesting, but its execution was dangerous!

And I didn't accept it out of fear that the walls of the building would collapse on someone's head. Because the walls were old and very wide and had to be removed gradually. Interestingly, we used the bricks of the wall, which were military bricks, to beautify and pave the floor of the garden.

Father said, ""The soil here is gold; we must make optimal use of every grain.""

My mother turned to me and said, ""You have the Midas touch.""

The walls around the garden were supposed to be removed, but at Mrs. Afshar's request, the entrance gate of the garden, with its carved columns full of inscriptions and decorations, was left untouched, and we only replaced the tiles of its inscriptions with turquoise-colored tiles on which we installed a poem that my mother loved.

If the favor of God adorns it, 

It is the Chinese painting gallery and the art of Arzhang.

My mother said, ""Let the beginning and the end of your work always be with the name and memory of God.""

Mr. Afshar and I also jokingly said to Mahshid, Anahita, and Mrs. Afshar, ""We wish you would also allow us to enter your garden and give our expert opinions on your work.""

They mockingly replied to us, ""We offered it to you, but your path was separate from ours from the beginning.""

In everyone's opinion, my masterpiece was the sculpture of the ""Shir Dal"" (Winged Lion), which we placed in the middle of the pond in the garden and positioned in such a way that a fountain of water spouted from its mouth, and the rest of the sculptures revolved around the Shir Dal. But in my own opinion, it was the creation of the Mother Goddess, about which I told them in German: »einen engel öhne flügel nennt man mama« (An angel without wings is called mother).

On the morning of the inauguration, everyone woke up to my mother's scream and ran towards my sculpture workshop in the basement.

My mother asked in astonishment, ""Son, where did you get this angel from?""

Father said, ""Give me her address so I can go ask for her hand in marriage...""

To which Mahshid replied, ""There are as many of these kinds of angels as you want on Telegram and Instagram.""

My parents angrily turned to Mahshid and said, ""Instead of making sarcastic remarks, hurry up and get ready so we can go to Baghe Mafregh. We have a lot of work to do there, and besides, if you can, find yourself an angel too, but a male one.""

When Mr. and Mrs. Afshar and Anahita came to the basement, they were very excited, and Anahita asked me about the stone angel, to which I replied, ""I saw an angel in a piece of stone; I carved the stone so much until I freed the angel.""

Then we all went to Baghe Mafregh for the opening ceremony. Apart from my parents and Mr. and Mrs. Afshar and a few of the employees and staff of the Cultural Heritage Organization and the municipality, and some of the city's residents, no one was there, whom my mother called ""civilized citizens"" and thanked them profusely.

Most of those present were art students of the Niloufar Irani Gallery, or the same group of Forty Girls that Mahshid and Anahita Afshar had gathered. It was as if they were the bride and the rest were their bridesmaids. In a way, it was good that the gathering was private, and the girls, who had mostly come from the Golvani celebration, were wearing their local flower-patterned headscarves and were all chattering, giggling, and laughing, and they also took on the responsibility of playing the kamancheh and tombak for the opening. When I went behind the podium, I said to them with a smile, ""Dear ladies, if your celebration is over, let me know, because we have a unveiling ceremony.""

A few of the children from the Kanun Parvaresh Fekri Koodakan va Nojavanan (Institute for the Intellectual Development of Children and Young Adults) also came, and surely the same rabbit-eared girl was among them. They asked me to allow them to perform their mask shows and plays there every now and then, to which I immediately replied, ""I built this garden for the general public, not for myself."" They also thanked me profusely.

I was wearing a suit and tie. I had a dress shirt on. I wore cufflinks and a bow tie, and my hair was styled in an à la garçonne cut.

My mother said, ""Well, your appearance had to be different from the others. How else would people know who made these sculptures?""

Father said, ""You're right. During the year you were busy making the sculptures, you were always wearing a dirty black men's apron.""My mother also tied my bow tie for me. But Mahshid had a different opinion and said, ""Behrameshid used the bow tie as a symbol and sign because he loves butterflies.""

Mahshid went behind the podium and after much coyness, feminine charm, and self-praise - which was not my dream and she laughingly introduced me as a skilled dream thief - she announced the name, details, and a summary of the mystery and symbolism of each bronze sculpture. As she called out each one, we would unveil it. To show respect to someone, we had written the letters of the alphabet on the wall, and on the base of each statue, we wrote a letter from the alphabet and placed them in neat rows in the same order so that this order could be easily seen from a horizontal plan:

B A kind and beautiful winged creature 

P A deer caught in a lion's claws 

T An eagle with a rabbit in its beak

J A bronze mirror in the shape of a lion and a human 

Ch A winged horse with a hollow stomach from the middle 

H A standing couple on a horse 

Kh Several men dancing in a circle around a horse 

D Circular Standard 

Dh Horse's bit in the shape of a chariot rider, chariot, and horse 

R Horse's bit in the shape of winged goats 

Z Carriages with two riders and four horses 

Zh Bronze ax head with the figure of a male and female archer on either side Its edges 

S A girl with earrings 

Sh Shir Dal (Winged Lion) 

S A depiction of the mythical Zurvan on a bronze plaque 

Z A cup with the image of a falcon in the sky and a lion on the ground 

T Gilgamesh strangling two lions 

Z Gilgamesh taming two mountain goats 

Ain Gilgamesh caressing two small long-beaked birds 

Gh Bronze cup with handles in the shape of two winged goats 

F Bronze pin with a plate depicting the Mother Goddess in childbirth
