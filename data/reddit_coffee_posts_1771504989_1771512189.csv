1r90xyc,https://www.reddit.com/r/SingleAndHappy/comments/1r90xyc/im_doing_it_im_moving_from_unhappily_single_to/,I'm doing it!!! I'm moving from unhappily single to happily single! :),"I've already posted here, and I think putting things into words and seeing reactions was a good wake-up call for me. 

As I'm ""rounding the bases to 30"" as I like to say (29M), I thought that would make singleness feel harder. But instead, I'm feeling what I've seen from a lot of people's thoughts, which is this movement towards calmer acceptance. My brain needed one final ""temper tantrum"" of not knowing how I would meet someone, when, or even if it would happen at all (no joke, I was lying on my couch in January, crying and SHAKING with my thoughts). And for the record, I still wonder those things, but they don't bother me as much. It's a calmer curiosity, not a source of terror or panic. I don't make it my job anymore to ""figure out how it'll happen"" or ""make it happen.""

And to be clear, it's not just about acceptance, but the acceptance has opened the door to what I love about my single life as it is. I'm starting a new career in fitness, so I love being able to take the whole day, preparing for my classes, being focused, not considering another person. When I'm done, it's fun to treat myself, I can have the freedom to either cook a nice meal or have a bag of chips on the couch. I dance badly in my apartment. My coffee table is covered in jigsaw puzzle pieces. No judgment from anyone!

I still want a partner one day. I still have crushes, I still see people every day that are gorgeous. As it's been up until now, there's often nothing I can do, it's just a fleeting moment in my brain. The classic moments of ""seeing a couple on the street"" or ""seeing a beautiful woman walk past you,"" anything like that, the worst I'll feel now is mild disappointment. But it's easier and easier to get over it very quickly. 

I guess the only reason why I'm posting this is to show that ""converting"" is possible. That with time and doing certain things, one can transform their single experience. I know I'll have setbacks, for sure. But having this space and putting things into words, feeling less alone, that was certainly helpful for me. Time really does miraculous things.",1,1771512074.0,SingleAndHappy,1,1.0,False

I'm awake far too early for my own good, and waiting for the sun to come up. It's alternating between freezing rain and rain, and I'm feeling cooped up on this short week. I've been into gravel biking last fall, and am trying to extend those vibes as far into the long cold dark as possible. In any case, at least the aforementioned freezing rain numbs me to my core haha. I just finished up an indoor ride, made some espresso, and am hoping to find some good conversation before I need to stop ignoring emails and get some work done.

I'm genuinely down to talk about anything. Coming off an uneventful Valentine's day, what was the worst date you've ever been on?? Tell me the last book you read, the podcast you are currently obsessed with, the last hike you went on that blew your mind? I'm down for it all.

Personally, I love cooking, anything outdoors, and anyone with a passion they want to share.

1r90xdw,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r90xdw,Coach Bleecker Bucket Bag review (and it’s on sale!),"I got the Bleecker Bag in Merlot leather in the mail last night from the Coach online store, where it is currently $180 marked down from $450.  Even though I bought some of the crystal items from Coach last year (I love the Gucci crystal bags for a “I don’t care if it’s tacky, it’s fun” moment but refuse to pay those Gucci crystal bag prices), I’m an old millennial that had a mental block against Coach for a loooong time. However, I had gone into the store a lot in the last year to feel and try on bags, and was really impressed with some of their leather offerings (not all, but some).

This bag is unbelievably soft and slouchy. The stitching is tidy and tight. The hardware is an antique gold. The logo? So small, just the embossed “coach New York” in small gold font towards the top of the bag (I haven’t been able to buy the bags with the giant C logo).

It’s also huge. There are 5 grommets on the wide shoulder strap that are each 3 inches apart, so you can make it into a shoulder bag or crossbody, but I will say that the crossbody function isn’t great if you are average or taller height and plan on packing the bag with a lot of things (because it’s a barrel shape bucket and the strap isn’t too long, it WILL jut out awkwardly if it’s too full and crossbody).  It looks best as a shoulder bag.  

You can fit a ton in here. I’m a mom with a 6 year old so even though I don’t need to carry as much with me on a typical weekend day out, I still will find great use for this. For moms with younger kids, you can easily pack an extra change of clothes, diapers, formula, snacks, toys, etc in here. For adults, it easily fits an iPad, water bottle, snacks, makeup bag, handheld gaming thing (even my husband’s steam deck, which is too big for most of my bags).  I took it to work today (lunch, coffee thermos, makeup bag, wallet, etc)). 

Overall, I’m obsessed. There is also a dark olive suede one that I’m now very tempted to get.  This is a GREAT bang for your buck bag, especially if you are wanting a kind of Mary Poppins bag right now.  Even at $450, I don’t think this is overpriced, but it’s truly a gem at $180. They have some colorful suede ones (like lavender or robins egg blue?) that are even cheaper now—like $120 or something. 

Anyway, happy Thursday!  I included some mod shots (I’m 5’5”, size 2) and tried to get some decent standalone photos, but it’s honestly so slouchy that it looks not amazing in photos. Definitely has to be worn or touched to really “get it”.

1r90xda,https://www.reddit.com/r/ConnectBetter/comments/1r90xda/how_to_speak_with_more_clarity_7_sciencebacked/,How to Speak With More CLARITY: 7 Science-Backed Tricks That Actually Work,"I've spent way too many hours watching successful people communicate. Podcasters, CEOs, professors who can make neuroscience sound like gossip. I got obsessed because I realized something embarrassing, I was terrible at getting my point across. People would zone out mid-sentence or I'd ramble for five minutes when I could've said it in thirty seconds.

The science behind clear communication is actually wild. Research from Stanford shows that cognitive load (basically how hard your brain has to work to process information) directly impacts whether someone actually absorbs what you're saying. Your listener's brain is lazy and will check out if you make it work too hard. I pulled insights from books, communication research, podcasts with speech experts, basically anything I could find on why some people sound crystal clear while others sound like they're reading IKEA instructions.

Here's what actually moved the needle for me.

**Stop burying your main point.** Most of us were taught to build up to our conclusion like we're writing an essay. Trash that habit in conversations. Lead with your bottom line, then add context if needed. ""We should move the meeting to Thursday"" hits different than ""So I was thinking about everyone's schedules and considering the logistics and maybe we could potentially..."" Communication experts call this the BLUF method (Bottom Line Up Front) and it's used everywhere from military briefings to newsrooms because it respects people's attention.

**Kill filler words by embracing silence.** Every um, like, you know, basically is your brain buying time to think. The fix isn't talking faster, it's getting comfortable with pauses. This sounds stupidly simple but it changed everything for me. When you need a second to think, just stop talking. Silence feels awkward to you but sounds confident to everyone else. I started practicing this during low stakes conversations, coffee shop orders, casual chats with coworkers, before trying it in meetings.

**Use the ""one breath"" rule for important sentences.** If you can't say your core idea in one breath, it's too complicated. This forces you to trim fat. I learned this from Never Split the Difference by Chris Voss, former FBI hostage negotiator who literally had to communicate clearly or people died. He breaks down how top negotiators use short, punchy sentences because they're impossible to misunderstand. The book is insanely practical, Voss was the FBI's lead international kidnapping negotiator and he teaches you to communicate like someone's life depends on it. Best communication book I've read, hands down.

**Actually visualize what you're saying.** Your brain processes images faster than abstract concepts. When you're explaining something, create a mental picture first, then describe what you see. Instead of ""Our strategy needs optimization,"" try ""Picture our current process as a highway with unnecessary exits, we're removing three of them."" This technique comes straight from presentation research. People retain visual information 60,000 times faster than text.

**Record yourself explaining something.** This one's brutal but necessary. Use your phone to record a one minute explanation of anything, your job, your weekend plans, why you hate cilantro. Listen back. You'll immediately hear the rambling, the run on sentences, the moments you lost the thread. I do this before any important presentation or difficult conversation. The app otter.ai will even transcribe it so you can see your filler words in writing, which is horrifying but effective.

If you want a more structured approach to leveling up communication skills, there's an AI learning app called BeFreed that's been helpful. Built by AI researchers from Google and Columbia, it pulls from communication books like Never Split the Difference, research on cognitive load, and expert talks to create personalized audio lessons. 

You can set a specific goal like ""communicate clearly in high-pressure work situations"" or ""speak confidently without rambling,"" and it builds an adaptive learning plan based on your personality and struggles. The depth is adjustable too, quick 10-minute summaries when you're busy or 40-minute deep dives with real examples when you want to go deeper. Plus you can pause mid-lesson to ask questions or get clarification, which is pretty useful for actually internalizing this stuff instead of just passively listening.

**Study comedians and podcast hosts.** These people are masters of clarity because they lose their audience instantly if they're not. I started watching standup differently, notice how comics set up jokes. They give you exactly the info you need, nothing extra. Same with podcast hosts like Lex Fridman or Tim Ferriss, they ask clean questions that don't take thirty seconds to get to the point. You can learn more about clear speech from watching a tight five minute comedy set than from most communication courses.

**Practice the ""explain it to a 12 year old"" test.** If you can't break down your idea for someone with a middle school vocabulary, you don't understand it well enough yet. I use this constantly now. Before meetings, I literally whisper to myself how I'd explain my point to my nephew. This isn't dumbing things down, it's clarity. Einstein supposedly said if you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough. Remove jargon, trim complexity, find the core.

The interesting thing about all this, and I didn't expect this, is that speaking clearly actually helps you think more clearly. When you force yourself to articulate ideas concisely, you spot the holes in your own logic faster. You realize when you're bullshitting yourself with vague concepts that sound smart but mean nothing.

Clear communication isn't some innate talent certain people are born with. It's a skill you build through deliberate practice and honest feedback. Your thoughts are probably fine, you just need better tools to get them out of your head and into someone else's without losing clarity in translation.",1,1771512033.0,ConnectBetter,0,1.0,False

Hey everyone — I'm Cam, co-founder of Impause. My co-founder Henry and I have been building an app that takes a behavioral psychology approach to personal finance, and I wanted to share what we're working on and get some feedback.

**The problem we noticed:** Every budgeting app out there tells you *what* you spent. None of them help you understand *why*. If you've ever rage-shopped after a stressful day, added to cart at 2am out of boredom, or justified a purchase with ""I deserve this"" — that's not a budget problem. That's a behavior problem. And budgets don't fix behavior.

**What Impause does differently:**

We use behavioral psychology techniques (similar to what Noom does for eating habits) to help people recognize the emotional triggers behind their spending. The core experience includes:

* **Purchase Pulse** — a quick daily swipe (think Tinder-style) where you rate recent transactions as worth it or not. Over time you start seeing patterns you never noticed.

https://preview.redd.it/3ql1tlhypgkg1.png?width=816&format=png&auto=webp&s=65d434c1b04f455da891070b2c70b042669b44e3

* **Challenges**— Boss Battles (gamified, fun — your spending weakness is the ""boss""), ""Everyone has a spending Achilles' heel. Time to beat yours.""

[Challenge Feature](https://preview.redd.it/v7lvc5ivpgkg1.png?width=716&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a722849b0504086283126c7219d28336fdb6ecd)

* **Gamified streaks and progress tracking** — because the dopamine hit that drives impulse buying can also be redirected toward building better habits.

**Who it's for:** We've found the strongest resonance with people who have ADHD, anxiety-driven spending habits, or anyone who's tried and failed with traditional budgeting apps because willpower alone doesn't work.

**Where we are:** We're approaching launch and preparing our YC application. The app is built in React Native and we're integrating Plaid for transaction data so users don't have to manually log anything.

Would love to hear thoughts, questions, or if this resonates with anyone's own experience. What features would you want to see in something like this?",1,1771511894.0,appideareport,0,1.0,False

The only difference is I'm conservative and she's liberal, like my wife. Kay's husband is a narcissist and controlling. She can't leave the house without him knowing where she's going and when she'll be back. That alone isn't a bad thing, but he's been known to follow and wait outside for her to come out. He thinks everybody should think and act like him, why I don't like being around him, and only ""helps"" when it benefits him, even when it concerns Kay. She is loving, has a submissive personality, and rarely does anything for herself. She has also been on several vacations with us, and I've seen her naked more than once. She is a very attractive woman. My wife Lisa (65) and I have been married 32 years. We have one child; a now adult daughter and she still live at home. When Lisa and I were first married, she showed me affection and care. When our daughter was born, it dropped some, but she still made some type of effort to show love and care towards me. In her 40's, she started telling me ""No"" when it came towards sex and within a couple years, it stopped altogether. I did not cheat then. Back at Valentine's Day, I had the usual gifts for my wife and daughter, and this time for Kay as well. We met at Star Bucks, her normal morning ritual so I could give them to her. I had a coffee with her and we sat and talked. We started holding hands during the conversation and the more we talked, the deeper it went. Soon we were sitting beside each other, I had an arm around her, she had her head on my shoulder and a hand in my lap. We decided she needed to get back before he came looking for her. Outside, we went to hug and kiss goodbye, except it wasn't that. We both gave a passionate kiss, not the peck on the cheek, a full lover's kiss and we were squeezing each other tightly. We parted, said goodbye and left. Later, she sent me a text asking if I could talk. She called and we discussed what had happened. During the call, we both told each other the L word. This last Monday, we met at the same Star Bucks, then after having coffee and talking, drove, separate vehicles, to a remote parking lot and made out in my backseat like two horny teenagers. We set some rules and emphasized that we won't leave our spouses, and this has to remain a secret. I'm seeing her again tonight at an AA meeting and probably tomorrow after I open the hot tub today. I don't know how much further this will go, or how long it will last, but for the first time in two decades, I feel wanted and needed. That's something my wife hasn't given in over two decades.

But it’s not the avocado toast or the Starbucks coffee. It’s everything else.

My best friend and I are a good example. We have the same level of education and for years earned pretty much the same salary. The difference is how we spent it.

When we bought our first cars, I paid cash for a used VW. He leased a Mercedes that cost about 15k more. We both like going to classical concerts, so we bought suits  mine was $300, his was $1,200.

On average, I spend around $2,000 a year on a beach vacation and about the same on a ski trip. He spends roughly three times that. Every single year.

He takes his girlfriend to big cities at least twice a week with dinner, drinks, expensive bars. I stay home with mine. We cook together, invite friends over, maybe play some games. His gaming PC cost about twice as much as mine I paid 2k, he paid 4k. And the list goes on.

Now we’re both 30. I’ve saved about 230k and bought a house. He has around 40k saved  and he’s planning to spend it on more travel with his girlfriend.

Here’s the part that might surprise you: we’re both genuinely happy.

The real point isn’t that one of us is right and the other is wrong. It’s that your spending should match your priorities and long term goals. If you’re unhappy or constantly stressed about money, then yes you probably need to take a hard look at your habits and make sure you’re living within your means.

This is aimed at people with regular incomes, not those being severely underpaid or exploited. That’s a different issue entirely.

At the end of the day, money is a tool. You just have to decide whether you want to use it for future security, present experiences, or a mix of both and then own that choice.",1,1771511559.0,unpopularopinion,12,0.52,False

1r90no7,https://www.reddit.com/r/RDR2/comments/1r90no7/i_finished_playing_rdr2_for_the_first_time/,I finished playing RDR2 for the first time...,"…and I just wanted to ramble and rant a bit, for all who might be interested. So obviously spoilers, for both games.

 

First of all, I've never liked the ""Western"" setting for my whole life. I've obviously heard that RDR1 was held in high regard, and when RDR2 released, I saw the stellar reviews. My flatmate at the time was playing it and I remember thinking that it looked awesome, but the setting still absolutely wasn't my cup of tea so I put it at the faaaaaar end of my ""to play"" list. But when I finished Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 and the last of its DLC last year, I felt ...withdrawal symptoms? for this type of realistic open world game and when I saw people online comparing these two games in some regards, and the stars aligned for a ""90% off"" deal on Playstation, I dug in.

 

Around 250 hours later... Let's just say I loved it so much I actually started to re-evaluate my dislike for this entire genre. Easy 10/10.

 

I want to add, I already knew some stuff about both games (RDR1: MC is forced to hunt his old gang, eventually dies and you play as his son. RDR2: MC dies from a sickness, you finish the game as MC from the first game, and your gang obviously goes to shit) but ultimately id didn't really matter. Knowing that it all goes to shit surely took some surprise away from the experience, but it also added a lot of dread and emotion. I quickly fell in love with Arthur(especially) and the gang, and going to the Downes' ranch for the first time already hit like a truck when I realized that this already was the death sentence for our boah. Also having him reflect on it in his journal afterwards, how he is ashamed of this kind of work, how they were looking at him like he was the devil... absolute cinema.

 

Oh, the journal! It absolutely took me by surprise and is probably the best feature of this game for me. Having this hardened taciturn killer actually write his deepest thoughts and feelings down, and being a surprisingly good artist, gave him so much personality from the start and instantly made me deeply invested in his character and development. I'm surely a sucker for that kind of emotional drama. And the way it was implemented, in actual handwriting, with errors and smudges on some pages - perfect. I feel like this feature is not talked about enough, we need it in more games!

 

I also went into this game expecting to do an ""evil"" playthrough for once, with us being a violent outlaw and all, which absolutely fell apart during Chapter 2. I just can't have our boah do bad things, I know he will be sad about them even if he doesn't admit it.

 

I guess I don't even have to mention the insane amount of details they programmed into this game. I remember telling my sister one day that, for all the bad news of crunch and overworked employees at Rockstar Games, you actually FEEL every second of that in RDR2. So many companies overwork their poor employees but then still release rushed, lackluster games, but here I can envision John Rockstar sitting at his desk chugging coffee night after night to painstakingly tweak the horse testicle physics and other elaborate things that many players probably won't even notice.

 

I also never expected to be so sad for John. The knowledge that Arthur's sacrifice in combination with his own hard work to be a honest guy won't give him a happy ending (at least from what I know from RDR1) actually hit me hard during the epilogue. I don't think

 

Now for the rant: When I started browsing through reddit posts and YouTube videos, I quickly noticed that soooo many people reported they put the game down (often during Chapter 1) because it was too slow and boring. My dudes and dudettes... are we playing the same game? Yeah, yeah, I know, different people like different stuff, but... you don't go hiking voluntarily and complain about walking. Like, what's the point in starting a game marketed as a huge realistic open world story-focused game, and then complain that it takes time to do stuff and you actually have to listen to some dialogue? I think quitting on Chapter 1 is like quitting a movie after 5 minutes - how would you have decided by then that it wasn't for you? There are also people who apparently started it several times, couldn't go past what's basically the intro, then at some point forced themselves to proceed, finished it and now think it's a 10/10 masterpiece - which I just really don't get. I guess gaming is my #1 hobby so I can put a lot of time and thought into it, so I bet my view is biased. But still... I never thought the beginning was ""boring and slow"", I was sucked in pretty much from the start, and it certainly didn't seem slower than the rest of the game. And the idea that you need to get to know the characters to care about them (which obviously takes some time) also isn't really that revolutionary.

 

That said, anyone got some great western movie recommendations, maybe some that fit the vibe and themes of RDR2?

 

I'm also currently thinking about giving the Mafia games a chance, since I also dislike that setting and people also hold those in high regard... and the KCD guy was involved there...

Separately, joint venture partner purchases 50 kg of fumed silica for advanced testing



PyroGenesis Inc., the leader in ultra-high temperature processes and engineering innovation, and a plasma-based technology provider to heavy industry & defense, confirms receipt of successful results from a US-based independent testing lab.



The lab confirmed that the fumed silica produced by the Company’s fumed silica reactor (the “FSR”) met the fundamental characteristic needed to advance.



This test was a first-step validation required by an MOU recently disclosed in a press release (refer to press release dated February 12, 2026).



Additional testing will be conducted by the potential joint venture partner (the “JV Partner”) to confirm expectations regarding specific product behaviour. To this end, the JV Partner has purchased 50 kg of fumed silica.



All testing is expected to be completed within 6 weeks. Technical due diligence is on-going and is expected to be completed within the next 4 weeks. Both testing and due diligence may be prolonged based on results during discovery.



As previously announced, PyroGenesis’ client HPQ Silicon Inc. (“HPQ”), through its wholly-owned subsidiary, HPQ Silica Polvere Inc. (“HSPI”), and an industrial JV Partner, have signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding (the “MOU”) to form a joint venture company.



PyroGenesis, who has been actively involved in all aspects of the negotiations of this MOU, is in the final stages of exercising its option to acquire a 50% interest in HSPI, as previously announced (press release dated May 30, 2024).



The purpose of the JV is to operate a 1,000 tonne per year (“1,000 TPY”) fumed silica production plant. PyroGenesis, under an exclusive manufacturing arrangement, will receive US$20.0 million (approximately CA$27.3 million) to build the FSR.



As noted in that release, next steps were dependent on the confirmation of certain chemical and compositional characteristics of the fumed silica powder produced by the existing FSR pilot plant.



It was also stated that fumed silica samples from the FSR had already been produced and delivered to the client and to a specialty testing laboratory in the U.S, and that tests were currently underway to confirm suitability.



The successful results announced today confirm this first step suitability. The tests conducted by the independent lab show PyroGenesis’ fumed silica meets a critical requirement required for the JV.



In addition, the JV Partner has purchased from PyroGenesis 50 kg of fumed silica for next step testing. On a separate note, the FSR has been running for longer periods of time, with data being gathered by the Company in preparation for the development of the 1,000 TPY system.



“Our fumed silica process represents a fundamental shift in how fumed silica can be produced. For decades, the industry has relied on large-scale facilities that demand substantial capital investment, and significant energy consumption,” said Mr. P. Peter Pascali, President and CEO of PyroGenesis.



“PyroGenesis has demonstrated that fumed silica can now be produced with a materially lower CO₂ footprint, reduced energy intensity, and, more importantly, at a scale that remains economically attractive without requiring massive CAPEX.



As such, the fumed silica reactor allows for profitable production at smaller scale. No longer will massive plants be required to produce fumed silica cost effectively.



This ability to decouple profitability from sheer plant size changes the competitive landscape by opening the market to multiple local producers.



It allows for more agile deployment, lower financial risk, and a production platform more aligned with the global push toward decarbonization.



In our view, this is not an incremental improvement, but a structural change in fumed silica manufacturing. It is game-changing in every sense of the word.”



The proposed fumed silica plant would be a commercial scale version of the current FSR pilot plant, which PyroGenesis designed, engineered, and constructed to convert quartz into fumed silica in a single and eco-friendly step, without the use of chemicals while producing no hazardous by-products.



The expectation is that the plant would be delivered within 12 months of the formation of the JV. It is also expected that there would be a need for a series of additional fumed silica plants of the same or larger size.



The MOU pertaining to the JV describes, amongst other elements, that:



The FSR will have a capacity of 1,000 TPY, and PyroGenesis will receive US$20 million to build the FSR.



2)



The FSR will be bought by the JV and financed by the JV Partner (terms and conditions yet to be agreed upon).



3)



The JV will own and operate the system with the goal of selling fumed silica at market prices.



4)



A royalty will be charged by HSPI, for each kilogram of fumed silica sold by the JV (price/kg not yet agreed upon).



5)



Profit-sharing distribution to the JV partners (terms and conditions to be agreed upon).



6)



An implied off-take agreement between the JV Partner and the JV to justify the creation of the JV.



As previously stated, the formation of the JV will be contingent upon the successful negotiation and execution of one or more definitive agreements pertaining to the JV and related obligations by the parties thereto.



These documents are expected to be completed and signed no later than the end of Q2 2026. It must be noted that there is no certainty that a JV will ever be formed or, if it is, that it is within the expected time frame noted above, or that once it is that it will be commercially viable.



INDUSTRY AND MARKET CONTEXT



Fumed silica is one of the most widely used industrial materials and can be found in thousands of consumers and industrial products, including cosmetics, toothpaste, pet litter, powdered food, milkshakes, instant coffee, pharmaceuticals, agriculture, adhesives, paints, inks, photocopy toner, sealants, fiber optic cables, thermal insulation, construction materials, and batteries, to name a few. It is often used in these products as a thickening/anti-caking agent, used to stabilize and improve the texture, consistency, and flow of the end-product.



Fumed silica is often combined with other materials to enhance performance. For example, in tires, it is blended with carbon-black to improve wear and efficiency; in batteries, it can be blended with graphite to enhance slurry uniformity and conductivity.



PyroGenesis was originally engaged to develop and build the FSR pilot plant for HPQ Polvere Inc., a subsidiary of HPQ Silicon Inc.



PyroGenesis has: (i) the rights, under an existing agreement with HPQ, to convert its annual royalty rights on future production of fumed silica, into a 50% interest in HSPI (an action that is currently underway), and (ii) an exclusive arrangement to be the sole supplier of equipment relating to any commercialization of the FSR.



About the Fumed Silica Reactor



PyroGenesis is the exclusive supplier of HSPI plasma-based technology that uses quartz (SiO2) as a raw material to produce commercial-grade fumed silica in a single and eco-friendly process while eliminating the use of harmful chemicals generated by some conventional methods.



The FSR requires no additional processes to develop to prepare feedstock, and no intermediary toxic chemical-based processing.



The FSR can produce fumed silica from quartz at one physical location. When compared to some multi-step, traditional processing methods, the expected benefits of our fumed silica reactor process can generally be summarized as follows:



(1) Lower capital costs



(2) Lower operating costs



(3) Reduction of CO2 emissions



(4) Reduction in energy footprint



(5) Elimination of purchase and storage requirements for hazardous chemicals



(6) Simplified logistics/shortened production chain due to the single location, single system, single phase process, and the elimination of feedstock ingredient handling, storage, preparation/transformation, and transportation



(7) Safer production environment due to absence of dangerous, toxic, or explosive chemicals.

1r90kb8,https://www.reddit.com/r/redscarepod/comments/1r90kb8/my_only_actual_talent_is_sleeping/,My only actual talent is sleeping,"Since I was a baby, I’ve always been a good sleeper. My older brother was too, so my parents ended up with a wildly idealistic picture of what raising children is like because they were almost never sleep deprived.

Now I’m in my 30s, and I genuinely can’t remember the last time I struggled to fall asleep and I think I may have never learned the particular despair of sleeplessness. 

I can be extremely stressed, anxious, even crying, but the second my head hits the pillow, I’m out. I drink coffee in the evenings. I have not always had comfortable beds and once spent years sleeping on a broken sofa. I look at screens before bed. I ignore pretty much every piece of advice ever given about good sleep hygiene. I will chug water and eat dinner 30 minutes before going to sleep. It does not make an ounce of difference.

I do not have any deficiencies or health issues that would explain why I excel at sleeping.

The downside is that I cannot function if I don’t get my nine hours. Seven and a half is not enough. I will either need a nap or I will end up sleeping ten and a half hours the next night to make up for it.

In most other areas of life, I am extremely unremarkable. I did not do particularly well in college. I struggle to hold down a job long term. I do not eat especially healthy and could stand to lose about 20 pounds. I do not have many hobbies, and the few I do have I am not very good at. I am often anxious and stressed, yet somehow none of it affects my sleep.

Put me on a train, a plane, or in a car and I will sleep - I don’t need a fancy sleep mask or a neck pillow. 

Sometimes I am irrationally afraid of losing this ability, because I would not have the faintest idea how to get it back. It feels like my one unquestionable talent",4,1771511133.0,redscarepod,2,1.0,False

* [PYR.TO](http://PYR.TO) (ASK @ 0.355)

Separately, joint venture partner purchases 50 kg of fumed silica for advanced testing

* PyroGenesis Inc., the leader in ultra-high temperature processes and engineering innovation, and a plasma-based technology provider to heavy industry & defense, confirms receipt of successful results from a US-based independent testing lab.

The lab confirmed that the fumed silica produced by the Company’s fumed silica reactor (the “FSR”) met the fundamental characteristic needed to advance. 

This test was a first-step validation required by an MOU recently disclosed in a press release (refer to press release dated February 12, 2026). 

Additional testing will be conducted by the potential joint venture partner (the “JV Partner”) to confirm expectations regarding specific product behaviour. To this end, the JV Partner has purchased 50 kg of fumed silica. 

All testing is expected to be completed within 6 weeks. Technical due diligence is on-going and is expected to be completed within the next 4 weeks. Both testing and due diligence may be prolonged based on results during discovery.

As previously announced, PyroGenesis’ client HPQ Silicon Inc. (“HPQ”), through its wholly-owned subsidiary, HPQ Silica Polvere Inc. (“HSPI”), and an industrial JV Partner, have signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding (the “MOU”) to form a joint venture company. 

PyroGenesis, who has been actively involved in all aspects of the negotiations of this MOU, is in the final stages of exercising its option to acquire a 50% interest in HSPI, as previously announced (press release dated May 30, 2024). 

The purpose of the JV is to operate a 1,000 tonne per year (“1,000 TPY”) fumed silica production plant. PyroGenesis, under an exclusive manufacturing arrangement, will receive US$20.0 million (approximately CA$27.3 million) to build the FSR. 

As noted in that release, next steps were dependent on the confirmation of certain chemical and compositional characteristics of the fumed silica powder produced by the existing FSR pilot plant.

 It was also stated that fumed silica samples from the FSR had already been produced and delivered to the client and to a specialty testing laboratory in the U.S, and that tests were currently underway to confirm suitability. 

The successful results announced today confirm this first step suitability. The tests conducted by the independent lab show PyroGenesis’ fumed silica meets a critical requirement required for the JV.

In addition, the JV Partner has purchased from PyroGenesis 50 kg of fumed silica for next step testing. On a separate note, the FSR has been running for longer periods of time, with data being gathered by the Company in preparation for the development of the 1,000 TPY system.

“Our fumed silica process represents a fundamental shift in how fumed silica can be produced. For decades, the industry has relied on large-scale facilities that demand substantial capital investment, and significant energy consumption,” said Mr. P. Peter Pascali, President and CEO of PyroGenesis. 

“PyroGenesis has demonstrated that fumed silica can now be produced with a materially lower CO₂ footprint, reduced energy intensity, and, more importantly, at a scale that remains economically attractive without requiring massive CAPEX. 

As such, the fumed silica reactor allows for profitable production at smaller scale. No longer will massive plants be required to produce fumed silica cost effectively. 

This ability to decouple profitability from sheer plant size changes the competitive landscape by opening the market to multiple local producers. 

It allows for more agile deployment, lower financial risk, and a production platform more aligned with the global push toward decarbonization.

 In our view, this is not an incremental improvement, but a structural change in fumed silica manufacturing. It is game-changing in every sense of the word.”

The proposed fumed silica plant would be a commercial scale version of the current FSR pilot plant, which PyroGenesis designed, engineered, and constructed to convert quartz into fumed silica in a single and eco-friendly step, without the use of chemicals while producing no hazardous by-products. 

The expectation is that the plant would be delivered within 12 months of the formation of the JV. It is also expected that there would be a need for a series of additional fumed silica plants of the same or larger size.

The MOU pertaining to the JV describes, amongst other elements, that:

1)

The FSR will have a capacity of 1,000 TPY, and PyroGenesis will receive US$20 million to build the FSR.

2)

The FSR will be bought by the JV and financed by the JV Partner (terms and conditions yet to be agreed upon).

3)

The JV will own and operate the system with the goal of selling fumed silica at market prices.

4)

A royalty will be charged by HSPI, for each kilogram of fumed silica sold by the JV (price/kg not yet agreed upon).

5)

Profit-sharing distribution to the JV partners (terms and conditions to be agreed upon).

6)

An implied off-take agreement between the JV Partner and the JV to justify the creation of the JV.





As previously stated, the formation of the JV will be contingent upon the successful negotiation and execution of one or more definitive agreements pertaining to the JV and related obligations by the parties thereto. 

These documents are expected to be completed and signed no later than the end of Q2 2026. It must be noted that there is no certainty that a JV will ever be formed or, if it is, that it is within the expected time frame noted above, or that once it is that it will be commercially viable.

INDUSTRY AND MARKET CONTEXT

Fumed silica is one of the most widely used industrial materials and can be found in thousands of consumers and industrial products, including cosmetics, toothpaste, pet litter, powdered food, milkshakes, instant coffee, pharmaceuticals, agriculture, adhesives, paints, inks, photocopy toner, sealants, fiber optic cables, thermal insulation, construction materials, and batteries, to name a few. It is often used in these products as a thickening/anti-caking agent, used to stabilize and improve the texture, consistency, and flow of the end-product.

Fumed silica is often combined with other materials to enhance performance. For example, in tires, it is blended with carbon-black to improve wear and efficiency; in batteries, it can be blended with graphite to enhance slurry uniformity and conductivity.

PyroGenesis was originally engaged to develop and build the FSR pilot plant for HPQ Polvere Inc., a subsidiary of HPQ Silicon Inc.

PyroGenesis has: (i) the rights, under an existing agreement with HPQ, to convert its annual royalty rights on future production of fumed silica, into a 50% interest in HSPI (an action that is currently underway), and (ii) an exclusive arrangement to be the sole supplier of equipment relating to any commercialization of the FSR.

About the Fumed Silica Reactor

PyroGenesis is the exclusive supplier of HSPI plasma-based technology that uses quartz (SiO2) as a raw material to produce commercial-grade fumed silica in a single and eco-friendly process while eliminating the use of harmful chemicals generated by some conventional methods. 

The FSR requires no additional processes to develop to prepare feedstock, and no intermediary toxic chemical-based processing. 

The FSR can produce fumed silica from quartz at one physical location. When compared to some multi-step, traditional processing methods, the expected benefits of our fumed silica reactor process can generally be summarized as follows:

(1) Lower capital costs

(2) Lower operating costs

(3) Reduction of CO2 emissions

(4) Reduction in energy footprint

(5) Elimination of purchase and storage requirements for hazardous chemicals

(6) Simplified logistics/shortened production chain due to the single location, single system, single phase process, and the elimination of feedstock ingredient handling, storage, preparation/transformation, and transportation

(7) Safer production environment due to absence of dangerous, toxic, or explosive chemicals.

We were together for 3 years and ehen we met, he owned this “very famous” bakery in the city... what I didn’t know? It was basically bankrupt. Over 1 million in debt. Loans, lawsuits, you name it... at one point he literally couldn’t pay his employees!!!!!! I was the one who told him to fire everyone because he clearly couldn’t afford staff. Guess who stepped in? Me of course... baking, selling, packing and all while working my own full-time, high-paying job.

Eventually we made the bakery profitable again. Lean structure, one employee, good revenue. On the surface it looked like it was finally working. Except, surprise surprise, it wasn’t. The debt was so massive that even with profit, it would NEVER cover it in a million years. Of course I was the one (because his family of incompetents lived in a dream where it was still a huge success) who sat him down and said: this is not sustainable. You need to close it. So I helped him close the bakery and I helped him apply for jobs where he eventually got hired (I work with HR).

Meanwhile I was paying most of the house bills, helping with lawyer fees, covering bakery supplies during low seasons. I probably spent close to 50k during that relationship, yes I am THAT stupid. I was completely drained... emotionally, financially, physically. I thought I was just tired from work. Turns out carrying a bankrupt business and a grown man is exhausting. Luckily that money is not will be needed anywhere because otherwise I'd probably be commiting myself now.  
His family? In complete denial. They see him as this huge entrepreneur, this visionary businessman!!!?!?!?!?! They care about appearances A LOT showing off money, cars, trips, whatever they can’t actually afford....  
While I was DROWNING myself to help their useless son, they were complaining that I “wasn’t present enough” and that I didn’t show up with a happy smile on my face at every family gathering. Yeah, I wonder why.

We broke up a couple months ago and I have never felt so light IN MY WHOLE LIFE.

We still go out because we share a couple of dogs and so last night we’re having coffee with them, everything normal so far and he casually drops the bomb that his family “wasn’t happy with the way I was” and doesn’t think we should ever get back together.

I’m sorry… what? Did I ever said I want to make up?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?

1r90c7y,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1r90c7y/i_run_5_hospitality_locations_across_3_countries/,I run 5 hospitality locations across 3 countries. Built a SaaS on nights and weekends because no AI content tool understood my brands. Paying users found me before I found them. Here's everything.,"I own and operate hospitality businesses. Five hospitality locations across India, Thailand, and the UAE. Specialty coffee shops and a boutique hotel. I make pistachio lattes, manage rosters, deal with suppliers, and handle guest check-ins. That's the actual day job.

I also happen to be an engineer. And when your day job involves running social media for multiple brands across multiple countries, and every post takes 2-3 hours to do properly, you eventually snap and build something.

The product is called Synthopia. It's an AI marketing platform where 20+ specialized agents handle the full content workflow, from creative direction to brand validation, in 25-45 seconds. It's live, it has paying customers, and I still haven't done any real marketing. 

Here's everything I learned building it on the side of a running hospitality business.

# Why single-prompt AI content tools are architecturally broken

Before I built anything, I tried everything. Canva for design. ChatGPT and Claude for copy. Jasper. Copy.ai. Buffer for scheduling.

They all had the same problem. One prompt in, one output out. No brand memory between sessions. No validation against your actual guidelines. No understanding that LinkedIn content should be structurally different from Instagram, not just shorter.

Here's why this matters: when a good marketing team creates content, it's not one person doing one thing. It's a creative director developing concepts. A copywriter crafting language. A designer handling visuals. A brand manager checking everything. They work in parallel. They catch things the others miss.

A single model call can't do that. Not because the model isn't capable, but because you're asking one process to do divergent thinking (creative concepts), convergent thinking (structured copy), visual reasoning (design direction), and evaluative thinking (brand validation) all at once. The result is always competent but generic. It sounds like AI wrote it. Because one AI did write it, in one breath, with no checks.

So I built a pipeline instead.

# The multi-agent architecture (this was the hardest and best decision)

20+ specialized agents, each handling one step of the workflow I was doing manually:

* Orchestrator parses what you want and routes the request
* Post Creator plans content structure and story arc
* Product Extractor and Creative Director run in parallel (they don't need each other)
* Copy Agent and Design Agent run in parallel (design doesn't wait for copy)
* All images generate simultaneously
* Brand Guardian and Creative Review validate everything before you see it

The Creative Director doesn't give you one idea. It gives you three: safe, moderate, and bold. Different metaphor, different emotional arc, different risk level. You pick a direction and iterate in plain English. ""Make the hook more aggressive."" ""Swap the metaphor."" ""Less corporate."" The Editor Agent figures out which specialist to route your feedback to.

Parallel execution was the unlock. Sequential pipeline doing the same work: 60+ seconds. Parallel: 25-45 seconds. We measured 3.4x faster. And the quality difference compared to single-prompt tools is not subtle. It's the difference between ""AI made this"" and ""wait, a team made this.""

# Brand understanding is the moat (not the agents)

This is the thing I'd tell anyone building in AI content: the agents are the engine, but brand understanding is the fuel.

Most tools ask for your brand name and your colors. Maybe a one-line description. Then they generate content that could be for literally any business on earth.

We crawl up to 10 pages of your website and extract 50+ dimensions of brand identity. Voice. Tone. Personality on a scale (not just ""professional"" but where on the spectrum between formal and casual, serious and playful). Audience segments. Anti-patterns, meaning things your brand explicitly doesn't do. Product catalog with fuzzy matching so the system recognizes when you're talking about your own products even indirectly.

Every agent references that profile. The Brand Guardian scores every piece against four weighted criteria: voice (25%), visual identity (30%), messaging (25%), and platform optimization (20%). Content that doesn't pass gets flagged before it reaches you.

This is why our users' content sounds like their brand instead of sounding like ChatGPT. The depth of the brand profile is what makes everything downstream work. If I were starting over, I'd spend even more time on this layer.

# The numbers (raw, unfiltered)

* **Launch**: About a month ago. Soft launch, no fanfare
* **Paying customers**: A handful. Found us through different channels. I wasn't marketing at all
* **Pricing**: $25/mo (Starter), $49/mo (Growth), $99/mo (Pro), $199/mo (Agency)
* **Content per piece AI cost**: $0.08 (article) to $1.50 (UGC video)
* **Margins**: 80-94% depending on content type
* **Platforms supported**: 14, with genuine per-platform adaptation
* **Content types**: 13 (carousels, single image, stories, reels, threads, articles, newsletters, video, etc.)
* **Build time**: Roughly a year on nights and weekends alongside running the hospitality business
* **Dev tasks**: 451 of 456 complete. The remaining ones are video pipeline polish
* **Database**: 26+ tables, 68 migrations, 17 external integrations
* **Team**: Just me
* **Marketing budget**: $0

The conversion signal is strong. People who try it tend to keep using it. The problem, like every founder reading this already knows, is top of funnel.

# What I got wrong

**Scope. I way overbuilt.**

451 development tasks for a side project is insane. 68 database migrations. I should have shipped a much smaller version much earlier. I kept telling myself ""just one more feature"" for months. The learning system, the metaphor diversity engine, the 3-concept creative system, the parallel pipeline optimization. All of it makes the product better. But I could have validated the core idea with 20% of this.

If you're building on the side of another business, ship ugly and early. I didn't, and I lost months of potential user feedback.

**Marketing. I have none.**

I know how to fill hotel rooms and get people to come back for coffee. I do not know how to acquire SaaS customers. My ""strategy"" so far has been existing. That's it. People found me. I didn't find them.

What's working:

* Word of mouth. Someone tries it, tells someone else. Slow but the quality is high
* Being active in communities where small business owners hang out

What's not working:

* Everything else. Because I haven't tried anything else. I genuinely don't know where to start with SaaS distribution and I'm not going to pretend otherwise

**Not talking about it sooner.**

I built in silence for way too long. Part of it was wanting the product to be ""ready."" Part of it was imposter syndrome from being a hospitality guy making a SaaS product. Both were mistakes. The earlier you talk about what you're building, the faster you learn if anyone cares.

# The side project question

Here's the thing I'm genuinely wrestling with and would love input on.

Hospitality is my business. Coffee shops and hotels are what I know, what I run, what my team depends on. Synthopia started because I needed it for our own brands. It became a product because other people needed it too.

But I'm one person on the tech side, running this alongside five physical locations. I care about this space. I think how people approach AI content is going to fundamentally shift from ""write a better prompt"" to ""use design vocabulary and let a coordinated system handle the workflow."" I want to be part of that shift.

I just don't know what the right level of investment is when your main business is making sure the espresso machine works and the hotel rooms get flipped on time.

# AMA

Happy to answer questions about:

* Multi-agent architecture vs single-prompt (I have strong opinions)
* Building SaaS on the side of a physical business
* Brand profiling and why most AI tools get it wrong
* Pricing a product when you have no SaaS background
* The weird overlap between hospitality operations and software engineering

Recently, a counselor told me that my experience sounds like institutional abuse. And that I'm traumatized. My mother- Who is a military veteran, but wasn't a conscript- Has said the same thing.

Now, here's the part that makes people uncomfortable: I feel way more disgust towards genuinely ""nice"" officers, than openly harsh ones.

There was one in particular, Katerina, who was very motherly. She's take me for little walks, or for coffee, and kept saying she wanted to help me make the best of that year. When my relationship was falling to bits and after not seeing my girlfriend for three months, I asked her if I could have time off. She felt awful about it, got me a long weekend. She kept telling me about this ""cool"" barber and how she'd be happy to give me the money since I apparently needed to get my hair cut because it was getting too long. When I said I hated barbers, she did it herself, she must have done it fucking blindfolded because I actually shaved it completely after, it looked so godawful...

She gave me her phone number, and sends Christmas and birthday presents since I got back. She's still friends with my parents, and says that she wants to help me heal, and wanted to give me something, if that's okay with me. I was hoping it would be something cool, so I thought, yeah, alright.

So... She had this bike. Like, a moped, she hasn't used it in years and it's a bit old but she said that me and my dad could maybe repair it and then I could use it. And I'm... Honestly, I'm offended. I'm completely offended.

I snapped at her recently- Before the bike thing, it made her more worried than upset at me, so obviously she felt bad. I'm disgusted by the whole dynamic. I don't know how I'm supposed to be grateful for her kindness. My brother is in Croatia with his friends. When he gets back, I'll give him a look, see if he wants the stupid thing.

I’m studying computer engineering and honestly, I’m pretty locked in on my goals. I want to build something of my own in tech one day, not just work a job, but create something meaningful and successful. That ambition is a big part of who I am.

Outside of school, I’m big on staying active. I play different sports, train regularly, and I’m currently trying to bulk up and get stronger. Self-growth has been a major focus for me lately — mentally and physically. When I’m not working out or studying, you’ll probably find me reading. I’m especially into history, the kind of stuff that makes you question how the world ended up the way it is. I also love long conversations, whether it’s deep life talks at 1 a.m. or completely random nonsense that somehow turns into a two-hour debate.

I’ve been in a serious relationship before, and after taking time for myself, I’m at a place where I’m open to meeting someone new. I’m not into games or rushing things, I’d rather build something real, even if it starts slow.

If we click, we could start by chatting a bit, maybe swap pictures, and if the vibe feels right, grab coffee or explore a cool spot in the city. Nothing complicated , just good energy and genuine conversation.

If you’re still reading, tell me two things:

1. What’s a food you could eat every week and never get bored of?
2. What does your ideal first date actually look like?

Then I looked East.","Do you ever feel like you’re running a marathon on a treadmill? You’re sweating, your heart is pounding, and the incline is set to max. But when you look down, you haven’t moved an inch.

We call this **""High Effort, Low Traction.""** It’s the modern condition: working ourselves to the bone but feeling like we’re just spinning our wheels.

I recently went on a deep dive into Japanese culture to find out how they manage to lead the world in longevity, economic power, and efficiency without ""moving fast and breaking things."" What I found wasn't a magic pill—it was a series of ""micro-habits"" that require almost **zero willpower** but deliver massive results.

Watch Video: [https://youtu.be/qIFlfa8Ez\_8](https://youtu.be/qIFlfa8Ez_8)

Here is the blueprint to becoming 1% better every day.

# 1. The ""Invisible"" Improvement (Kaizen)

We often think success requires a giant, dramatic leap. But big changes trigger the **amygdala**—the part of your brain that handles fear. When you say, ""I’m going to the gym for two hours every day,"" your brain sees it as a threat and shuts you down with ""laziness.""

**The Hack:** Bypass the guard dog. Commit to **one push-up**.

The goal isn’t the muscle; it’s building the neural pathway of the habit. Once you’re on the floor for one, you’ll likely do ten. You’ve broken the inertia.

# 2. The 80% Rule (Hara Hachi Bu)

Ever had that 2 PM ""food coma""? That's a biological system failure. There’s a 20-minute delay between your stomach being full and your brain realizing it.

**The Hack:** Stop eating when you are **80% full**.

Stop when the food stops tasting ""amazing"" and just starts tasting ""good."" This lands the plane perfectly, prevents brain fog, and actually slows down aging.

# 3. Manual Wealth (Kakeibo)

In a world of Apple Pay and ""one-click"" buys, spending feels like a game. There’s no ""pain of paying.""

**The Hack:** Write your expenses down **by hand**.

When you physically write ""Coffee: $6.50,"" your brain processes the loss. Studies show Kakeibo users often cut spending by 15-20% just through awareness alone. No strict budget needed—just a notebook.

# 4. Paint Your Scars Gold (Kintsugi)

We spend so much energy hiding our failures and filters. The Japanese art of Kintsugi involves fixing broken pottery with **gold lacquer**.

**The Takeaway:** The object is considered *more* beautiful because it was broken. Your resilience is your gold. Don't hide the ""cracks"" in your life—they are the proof that you survived and grew stronger.

# 5. Why Cleaning Your Toilet Makes You Rich

It sounds like a chore, but for leaders at companies like Panasonic and Honda, it’s a spiritual practice.

**The Logic:** If you are willing to clean the dirtiest place until it sparkles, you prove that no job is beneath you. You train your eye to see tiny details and inefficiencies that others miss.

# The Foundation: Finding Your ""Why"" (Ikigai)

All these habits are just infrastructure. They build the platform for your **Ikigai**—your reason for waking up in the morning.

If you have a void in your life, you fill it with bad habits. If you find your purpose, the bad habits simply have no room to grow.

# 🚀 The ""Atomic Growth"" Challenge

The fastest way to fail is to try to do all of this at once. That is the anti-Kaizen way.

**I challenge you to pick just ONE for this week:**

* **The Genkan:** Align your shoes neatly by the door every time you come home.
* **The 30-Day Rule:** See something you want? Write it down and wait 30 days before clicking buy.
* **The 90-Minute Bath:** Take a hot bath 90 minutes before bed to trigger your body's ""sleep mode.""

Turns out, I was basically giving away 2–3 hours of billable work every week because I forgot the small stuff.

I decided to fix my workflow and cycled through 4 tools. 

Here’s how they actually felt:

• Toggl: It’s the gold standard for a reason—beautiful UI. But it’s a pure timer. I found myself still stuck in ""admin hell"" on Fridays, manually copying those hours into a separate invoice template. Great for tracking, annoying for billing.

• Harvest: This felt like the ""professional"" choice. It handles everything, but as a solo dev, I felt like I was paying for (and navigating) features meant for a 10-person agency. It felt a bit ""corporate"" for my lifestyle.

• Clockify: If you love data and charts, this is it. But honestly? It’s overkill. I don’t need a deep-dive productivity report; I just need to know how much to charge my client for Tuesday’s work.

• Tympi: This is what I landed on. It’s the first one that felt like it was built for my brain. The ""auto-stop"" saved me when I walked away for coffee and forgot the clock, and the fact that it turns tracked time into a professional invoice in about two clicks is the real game-changer. It removes the ""admin friction"" that I used to procrastinate on.

The Lesson: Don’t pick the tool with the most features. Pick the one that actually gets you paid faster. 

For me, that meant moving away from ""enterprise"" dashboards toward something leaner.

What’s your stack looking like lately? 

Anyone else find that the ""big"" tools are actually slowing them down?",1,1771509894.0,ProductivityApps,0,1.0,False

We started working out together, then hanging out more regularly. I introduced him to my friends, he introduced me to his. At one point I even introduced him to one of my friends who became his girlfriend. They dated and later broke up, but we stayed close throughout everything.

Since last August, things escalated in terms of time spent together. We’ve basically been seeing each other almost every single day. The maximum we go without seeing each other is maybe two days. We both work remotely, so we often work together at cafés, then go to the gym together, then grab coffee after. We can spend entire days together and don’t get bored. We include each other in almost every plan — parties, weekend trips, outings. He constantly talks about future plans with me and assumes we’ll do things together.

There’s also a lot of physical closeness. He holds my hand sometimes, cracks my fingers, finds excuses to touch me. He jokingly chokes me sometimes. He’s kissed my hand playfully. He compliments me often, calls me pretty, takes pictures of me all the time, bakes for me occasionally, always drives me home, plays with my hair, put his finger inside of my ear lol, sometimes he would pull me into his chest while driving and tickling me. Most of our friends assume we’re dating, but we’re not.

On my birthday (we were both drunk), he grabbed me in a way that crossed the friendship line, and when I kissed him on the cheek to say goodnight, he slightly turned his face like he was trying to make it more than just a cheek kiss. The next day we both pretended nothing happened.

  
Oh, and he once showed up at my house at 11pm just to apologize because we had a fight that day.

Recently he’s been getting irritated if I make big plans without him (for example, going on a trip with friends). He also comments on other guys I see and says I’m “out of their league” and deserve better. When I mentioned one of my close male friends, he said he could never imagine me with him because I’m “too hot” and “out of his league.”

He’s currently seeing another girl, but when she called while we were together and asked to meet, he told her no and stayed with me. He’s also asked me how to cancel on many girls before and talks to me about other girls in a way that sometimes feels like he’s trying to make me jealous.

There’s emotional intimacy too — we talk a lot, he says he misses me if we don’t see each other for a couple of days, and he remembers specific moments we shared as highlights. Also sometimes we casually talk about our turn ons lol and our fantasies.

We built towering castles and obelisks, and carved our churches from the face of mountains.

Look at our zefen, our injera and misir, our netela and kemis, Sunday mezmur and coffee ceremonies. Do you remember how proud we used to be?

1r8zw0w,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeDecorating/comments/1r8zw0w/blending_interior_design_styles_when_moving_in/,Blending Interior Design Styles When Moving In Together — Real-Life Family Lessons & Practical Tips,"Hey folks,

Moving in with your partner or merging households is one of those life milestones that’s equal parts thrilling and nerve-wracking, especially when your idea of “home” looks nothing like theirs. Maybe one of you is all about that clean, modern vibe, while the other hoards vintage finds like they’re going out of style. If you’re staring at a pile of mismatched stuff wondering how it’ll ever work, trust me, you’re not alone.

I’ve been in the trenches with clients facing this exact challenge, and I wanted to share a real family story that might help anyone decorating with different styles, without the drama.

**The Family Setup: Clashing Vibes Under One Roof**

Picture this:

* Dad is the king of backyard barbecues, always pushing for wide-open spaces to host friends and family.
* Mom is the heart of the home, craving those soft, cozy spots with plenty of blankets and warmth.
* Their daughter is a quiet artist who needs her own little hideaway to sketch and unwind away from the chaos.
* The son? Total extrovert, friends dropping by constantly like it’s a perpetual open house.

The love was real, but so was the tension: furniture fights, color clashes, you name it. It reminded me so much of couples’ interior design projects: one person wants sleek lines and neutrals, the other loves patterns and heirlooms. Sound familiar?

**Practical Tips to Make It Work (No Design Degree Required)**

**1. Build from a Neutral Foundation**  
Start with the big stuff: sofas, rugs, tables; in easygoing colors like gray, beige, or soft white. A simple oak coffee table or an ivory area rug doesn’t scream “my style only” and gives you both room to layer in your personalities. It’s like starting with a blank canvas, you can both build on.

**2. Add Your Personal Twists with Smaller Stuff**  
This is where the fun (and compromise) happens. Let each person pick accents that scream “me”, artwork on the walls, funky pillows, a cool lamp, or cozy throws. In this family, the daughter curated her nook with her own paintings and a soft reading light, while dad added some vibrant cushions to the couch. Mix old-school classics with fresh modern pieces to keep it interesting. It’s about balance, not perfection.

**3. Focus on What Actually Matters: Comfort and Adaptability**  
Don’t get hung up on trends; think about how you’ll actually live in the space. Movable furniture or lightweight pieces let you shuffle things around; open it up for game nights, cozy it down for movie marathons. Pro tip: A basic rug can unify a room better than any statement chandelier. Keep it functional, and the style will follow.

**4. Get Real About Your Non-Negotiables**  
Sit down over coffee (or wine) and ask: “What’s one thing you absolutely need in our space?” or “Is there that one piece from your old place you can’t part with?” For this family, it turned arguments into a shared list and made everyone feel heard. It turns decorating with different styles into a team project instead of a tug-of-war.

**How It All Shook Out**

By the end, their home wasn’t only pretty; it felt like them. Cozy corners for quiet time, open areas for big laughs, and little details that nodded to each person’s vibe. The daughter finally had her sanctuary, dad could entertain without stepping on toes, and mom just glowed knowing everyone was content. Blending styles doesn’t mean sacrificing yours; it’s about creating something better together.

**What About You?**

Have you ever mixed industrial edges with boho softness, or tried the minimal-maximal mashup? Did it click, or did you end up with a hilarious disaster? If you’re in the thick of it and can’t decide, try assigning rooms: you style the bedroom, they handle the kitchen. It’s a low-stakes way to experiment.

What's the weirdest style clash you've dealt with?

Curious how everyone marks the moment. Do you:

* Cash out immediately and call it a day?
* Treat yourself to something coffee, dinner, etc?
* Keep playing because you are on a roll?
* Tell someone about it?
* Just quietly smile and move on?

Don’t get me wrong, I love being outside and meeting people and travelling but in moderation. There’s nothing more appealing to me than being in my own room for hours listening to music, reading, having a coffee and just shutting myself away from the world after a busy day of dealing with people. 

I think I lost this aspect of myself when I got into a relationship with someone who I’m not with now  and felt sort of co dependant on that person. That my happiness and anything good that happened to me was always somehow related to my partner. I don’t know how many other introverts feel like this.

1r8zt6g,https://www.reddit.com/r/energy_work/comments/1r8zt6g/a_true_vent_about_reality/,A true vent about reality,"These are some ocean thoughts I remember a time whenever everything felt still and not so fast in the world and then somehow everything changed I don't remember who I used to be as well as I would want to but I remember her as someone that was so full of life and laughter she had friends she had creativity the ability to put her mind to anything and make it work and as I'm getting older I just feel like I'm getting more tired and I don't have the energy to have creativity or Draw saying you get to a certain point where you just feel like what's the point in it all you watch the cars pass by and the people pass by Nature keeps moving with or without you and you're stuck in the middle you don't have much to hope for because you see where your life's going. people want fancy things material things but that doesn't feel the hole in your heart whenever you're by yourself. And for some reason people say you have the power to change it but for me I have felt powerless in my own life and that's not to say that I don't strive hard for what I do in life I'm not lazy I work hard for the things that I do my job I work hard there myself I try to be a better person and in the end it just feels like I never have enough answers and I know that I have to have peace with myself before I can even start having some answers but what can you do whenever your life is so numb not in a sense that you know you're super depressed I do have depression but I think I'm at a Crossroads where I have a path that I have to choose and I don't know which direction to take I know I want to be successful and have money and everything that I dream for but at the same time I feel like the system stacked against me sure the world's beautiful but how it runs is pretty evil and the best times I feel like is whenever you can go sit by yourself in nature or the world's quiet the only thing you can hear is the waves crashing on the ocean you hear the birds sometimes and the life around you but it's Stillness it's not loud it's not busy it gives you a chance to really look at your perspective when you quiet everything out I feel like accountability is the biggest portion of my life that I don't know how to get right not because I don't know how to take accountability but because sometimes I don't know what to be accountable for innocent like with my job I love my job it's a pretty easy job I get paid very well but at the same time I feel like I'm not happy there I feel like it's just a phase waiting to pass and I wanted to retire from there but at the same time I don't want to be stuck doing the same thing over and over again I want to make a difference in life if not a big one at least a little one I think that's everyone everyone wants to do that but a lot of time I feel like sin gets in the way of all of that and I'm not talking about like oh if you send you're going to hell I'm talking about the moral principles that are inside all of us we all have them but it's up to us to listen to him and the more you ignore your basic morals the more you lose yourself in the process and I don't necessarily don't think I have any morals because I do care a whole lot about a whole lot of things but they're also comes a point where you're just so tired that caring about things even seems like a chore like caring about how the world is going caring about how the system is currently falling apart how evil runs every corner especially with money and how you just want a simple life and you don't want to chase that dream that everyone else so desperately wants I just want to quiet place ducked off in the country or the forest just a little nice little abode enough money to see the world before I die enough money to take care of my family make sure they have everything they need but at the same time it seems all pointless because how are we going to be in a world where that's not even possible I feel like change is necessary but change can't come from one person it can only come from some Unity but I feel like everyone's so caught up and being separate and different that they forget that they can actually just you know care about their brothers and sisters we're the same species you know there's so much hate and bitterness and anger in the world that it's hard to release it all because you're just surrounded by it everywhere you go and especially if you're empathetic you feel it all all the time especially if your spiritual and that can be a lot of burden to bear I think a lot of people that are really sad in life they just had the ability to really feel a lot and I don't think that's a weakness I think it's a superpower but at the same time so many people get lost in that feeling because they don't know how to channel it into something healthy people do drugs they do addictions hell I even almost fell victim to addictions would drink them wanted to get away from the world want to numb myself out but at the same time I can't do that I got too much on the line to lose and I can't be like everybody else that I know in my life I can't use drugs as a way out and I've been battling with that addiction demon not necessarily doing anything but when it's speaking to you and telling you oh you should just numb it all out because the world ain't getting no better I don't want to listen to that voice though I don't want to listen to those bad thoughts I want to find a way to make peace with myself in a way that's healthy and I haven't really had to talk to myself in a minute a real talk to myself I think I do feel a lot all the time and I get angry cuz I don't know what to do with it you know there's a lot of things that I wish I could fix but I think the only person that I can really hold accountable and fixes myself and sometimes I can't understand how to do that cuz I don't think I was ever taught really everyone that I know don't really know how to figure themselves out or dig deep enough to not be surface level they don't want to have the hard conversations or really think about the world around them it's better to consume to watch TV to be on your phone to really numb it all out if you're not addicted to drugs or alcohol you addicted to something else which is consuming and I feel like a lot of people don't want to come to terms with that they can't just be peaceful just sitting by themselves and relaxing and taking the world in cuz I know they did try a lot of them would cry they would feel everything all at once they would just sit there and cry and I think it's okay to do that I feel like a lot more people need to do that because once you become aware of yourself you're able to change and you're able to hope for better and support people better and I'm using this as advice to myself on how to get through it because I don't know how to get through it you know you become an adult and you're supposed to be expected to figure everything out you supposed to know what to do but the teachers in your life ain't really nothing so you get a sense of being lost and you go by what you know and I think that's what I'm experiencing because I just don't have enough teachers and I don't know how to get more of them because not a lot of people want to be helpful someone is sit down with talk to have a cup of coffee with talk about the about the world too and then try to really connect and talk about the world and how it is I think people are incapable of realness I think they're scared to be real they're scared to be ugly and messy they're scared to feel all their emotions but you can't be if you want to learn how to ground yourself you can't be scared of the bad days because good days are going to come and every bad choice you make in life is nobody's fault with your own but a lot of people want to blame the world around them and play victim but most the time they're not willing to hear that they put themselves in that situation and how did they put themselves in that situation that's a hard question for myself sometimes as well I don't really ask myself what can I be doing to hold myself more accountable I think accountability is in a secured term people don't really know the depth of that word accountability isn't just saying sorry and saying that you're going to do better the next time it's actually digging deep and seeing where you went wrong and respectfully I had my realization today that I haven't really been taking a lot of accountability for myself but that's a story for another day today is just really about finding yourself and how can you feel more connected to it I mean people pray and everything they pray in God they pray for wealth they pray for love they pray for this they pray for that but I don't think they ever really pray for themselves and a lot of times money greed selfishness people think that's a prior to themselves but that's just sin baby that is just said wrapped in a nice bow to make it more digestible when you say it but I think really praying for yourself goes a little like this I pray that I find peace Within Myself I pray that I'm connected to more accountability I pray that I can overcome anger and bitterness inside of myself I pray that I can see an outcome for every obstacle then I can overcome every obstacle I pray that I find the strength inside of me to keep moving even when it's hard I pray that I can wake up and not feel the weight of the world on my shoulders and I don't know if there's a God out there but I think praying to yourself for yourself is the love that you can show yourself even if you're not familiar with love they say self love is a powerful thing but when you can really sit with yourself and speak kindness into your heart and kindness into your soul that's the kind of love that you need not somebody besides you telling you what you want to hear not somebody that can influence you negatively not your family not your friends nobody can speak love and to you beside yourself because if you listen to someone else how you're going to hear is that ego you're going to hear oh someone loves me so now I'm worth it and that's not a conversation that you should like having with yourself because that's your ego speaking it's not your soul it's not feeling safe in your own mind it's not feeling safe in your body you know a lot of conversations could be had but until you start speaking that love into yourself you're never going to know what it feels like to feel like home in yourself and damn taking it all in it's pretty insane I don't think I'm crazy I don't think I'm nothing negative I'm something that's different I think differently than other people I feel differently than other people I see the world differently than other people I don't see it with anger and Hate I mean I have days where I'm angry but the world around me I don't see it Angry I don't see it mad I see it still I see it peaceful even when there's chaos because that's the world that I want to come to live in is peaceful not chaotic not loud not busy just sit by the water and relax be okay with just being alive and well and enjoying every day like it's your last you don't need money to make you happy but unfortunately the world that we live in makes money go around but money shouldn't make anything go round because all it brings is a life that I don't want to live in and I'm not suicidal I don't want to die but at the same time this world that I'm in is not the world that I want to be in and it's hard to create your own world whenever there's so many outside factors affecting it and they say that you are the maker of your reality so I guess it's a change of perspective really the world I'm in right now is it filled with craziness isn't filled with all the drama the world that I'm in right now is peaceful and still and nothing's moving it's just relaxed so if you dig a little deeper and want to find a little bit more meaning then look at your own perspective what do you see in your life do you see chaos do you see drama when you see peace at the end of the day when you work on yourself you really work on yourself you can see your reality and it's not really not really like how you think it would be when something's boring and calm and still that's your safety when things are chaotic wild negative that you're Danger and if you really look at your perspective you can see that this world is built on Danger is Maine to put you in a fight feeling all the time so people don't get to relax people have anxiety they have depression they have everything that bothers them you know and mental illness I don't think is really deep like they they make it out to be where you need pills and you need this and that some people need it for sure but no I think a lot of that is having a conversation with yourself feel like damn cuz I really upset about that other stuff that I have no control over damn do I really like want to be upset about something that I can't fix because you get lost in your head and you be thinking about all this stuff you'd be thinking about you know the world the way it is the economy the place is the prices the families the people though everything you be thinking about everything whenever you get in a swirl of anxiety because anxiety is that like fear of the mind you know but when you look at it and you see that perspective in your reality like okay where am I at right now I am in a forest sitting in sand listening to the birds I'm watching the waves I'm watching the world just Float On by like your dad is your reality not everything else and I'm making this for myself so I can have something to read whenever I feel like the world around me is going crazy because sometimes I lose touching myself and they say writing and talking about and really going through it is good for you so this is my attempt at doing just that and I don't have the patience to sit down and type everything I don't want to look at my phone so I'd rather just voice it because then at least I can be present in my own moment I think that's another way of really like opening your eye people call it the third eye but it's not really the third eye it's just your awareness to the reality around you the sounds the feelings the vibrations when you feel like the world is going to s*** that's what you got to hone into is that you got a hone into how you feel about the world where you at with it how can you fix it for yourself like in my reality I feel like the thing that I can work on on myself is holding myself accountable to go to sleep on time that's something I know I need to do because it's draining me not having enough sleep it's taking a little bit of my life worth another thing that I could do to be better is I think work on how I interact with people because I'm a very antisocial individual in a sense of I like being around people but I don't like interacting with people because a lot of times the stuff that comes out their mouth really isn't anything that I care to hear about and that might be an a****** thing to say but all the conversation is is so basic it feels like you're talking to robots or you're talking to like just people that aren't really there you know they're not aware of themselves so they don't have a sense of like how to take conversation deeper is more all surface level and those kind of conversations can be very draining as well because it's like you're trying to meet someone where they're at but how you meet them how you want to meet them isn't possible because they're just not meeting you on the level that you need to like really have connection and feel happiness in that connection but regardless you shouldn't rely on connections to be happy anyways you know being alone is your most powerful tool because it teaches you how to how to understand yourself and understand where you want to go isolation is a is a medicine not a sickness you don't want to be isolated for too long but sometimes you got to take a couple of months to just really be by yourself and think about how you can grow as a person I think that's harder than to do than anything else like I haven't really got to talk to myself in a minute man but you have so many Personalities in so many different things that you experience and another thing I could do better is to stop vaping because I don't want to have any addictions to the mind like the two biggest addictions that I'll have to face is for one the addiction of consumerism where I want to buy stuff and buy stuff to fit in with this world but at the same time I just don't give a s*** at what I look like anymore it's nice to feel good about yourself and whatever but at the same time I wish you know people would just accept you for looking however you look but that's besides the point consumerism like I said is a big addiction point for me when I feel sad I want to go thrift shopping or buy something or do something but you know at the same time everything in this world that you want to do cost money so it's really hard to do that another thing that I could work on is being a better parent not that I'm not a good parent because I know that I love my boy immensely and I do anything to protect them and I know sometimes it feels like I could be a little harsh because I wanted to be tough in life I want them to know that there's going to be scars in life you know that you're going to have to overcome like when your emotions feel big how can you like Let It Go but at the same time I feel like I could just do better I could speak sweeter I could do more of a nurturing role I could find ways to connect like doing games and playing whatever you know like good stuff like the good memories taking them to do things that I know I've given them a lot of those opportunities that he can remember for the rest of his life but you know I want to have those conversations like you know what's the best memory that you have I think the biggest thing is like what do I want out the conversation and how do I Foster you know healthy communication cuz for me communication has been very difficult especially being in an abusive household you know we were screamed at constantly and my parents really didn't have the understanding on how to nurture it either cuz their parents didn't nurture it and I think the hardest cycle to break is this family curses like you look at your family and you see all the flaws not to be judgmental but to understand yourself and the things that you can repeat and I don't really want to repeat the same things that they put me through and so far for 5 years you know I haven't had him he has an experienced none of that stuff you know so I'm doing a good job in that aspect of protecting them from that reality I don't ever want him to experience his mom walking in with track marks on her arms I never want her or him to experience having their family so high on drugs all the time that they lose themselves all together and they have to watch their whole family just fall apart that hurts that hurts probably the most because a lot of things that come to from you are from your childhood so you have to look at your childhood as well to really understand like where do you come from what's the positions that you were put in how many people did you meet how many of people impacted your life where'd you put yourself where were you guided like you know and my parents did their best and I love them still you know I always love when I come to peace with the terms and conditions around those relationships but at the same time it's like in your world when you want family and you don't really have family it gets kind of sad cuz all you want is a family like you know whenever you have a family in your kid and you have a huge family right like 30 60 people in that b**** not everyone grows up with that so I think that's a blessing but I grew up with a big old family like that 60 years old all the way down there was multiple Generations sitting at the table during holidays you know there was like 30 people at the house everybody helping out everybody cooking everybody putting in together that teaches you something it teaches you love and those are the roots that you can't forget even if somewhere down the road everything goes south and it has I'm telling you it has where you're just a teenager you know growing up in the world as they do you're depressed you self-harm you starve yourself cuz you're battling with so many demons you know as a kid you battle with demons especially if your people are wrapped in them yeah come on keep going I don't want you near me sometimes you just got to stop and sit in silence at that point my brain was just going off on a tangent so I just stopped talking I'll be getting deep in the s*** but s*** honestly I should write a book or write a podcast I think a book would be really nice to write you know the survival of a young mind in today's economy and in today's world of evil. This is that energy work on ten

I’ve been working on a small live sports streaming project and I’d really appreciate some honest feedback from this community.

The idea was to keep the UI minimal and clean, without the usual clutter. I currently run the lowest possible amount of ads just to cover server costs, but I’m seriously considering removing them and switching to a donation model instead (Buy Me a Coffee or similar).

I also added a multi-stream feature so users can watch multiple matches at once — not sure how useful that actually is in practice. I’ve been thinking about adding a live chat as well, but I’m unsure if that would add value or just create moderation issues.

I’d genuinely appreciate any feedback — especially criticism. What would make something like this worth using for you?",2,1771509082.0,PiracyBackup,1,1.0,False

I'm into video games, too. I mainly play Overwatch, Marvel Rivals, Valorant, and Ark Suvival Ascended. Love playing Pokemon games and doing some Pokémon card collecting, too.

I have been having intermittent nausea/vomiting, severe brain fog, exhaustion, intermittent tingling/numbness, consistent pain (but also EDS), gastro distress, and so on for a few years now. I have a couple enlarged lymph nodes (>3cm) on one side of my neck that were discovered at the start of my symptoms over 5 years ago, they have been biopsied and are normal, and the ENT highly suspected something else being enlarged in the neck is inflaming them. Only my thyroid has been checked and cleared. Just had calcium, PTH, and Vit D tested together for the first time and wondering if there is any chance this could explain everything finally.

I did accidentally take biotin daily, and with coffee the morning of the blood test about 3.5 hours before testing. (No one mentioned fasting would be best)

Calcium - 10.3mg/dl (ref range 8.7-10.2) (Calcium was 10 in 2021, 10.1 in 2022, 10.2 in 2023, 9.4-10.2 in 2024, 10.2-10.3 in 3 tests in 2025)  
Vit D - 20.3ng/ml (ref range 30-100)  
PTH - 20pg/ml (I have seen mixed comments on if this counts as suppressed, and I know biotin likely impacted this result)

My doc put me on high dose vit D, and I was already taking 1000iu D3 daily prior to this. I was also put on a calcium supplement about 7 years ago for low calcium but I don't have those labs anymore. 

Should I push to retest sooner rather than later or wait a few weeks to see what the high dose vit D does?

The bay doors sealed with a resonant clang, and the crews disembarked—Kelly on crutches, her right ankle braced, leaning on Titus for support. Cathy and Edward followed, shouldering the packs, their faces etched with the fatigue of a long flight but the satisfaction of a job well done.

Joana Taylor met them on the deck, wheelchair at the ready  ” Kelly waving it off she was not going to be pushed around “ , her expression a mix of relief and frustration. She had planned this flight of two shuttles meticulously—from cargo distribution to crew assignments—ensuring redundancy and efficiency. But accidents like Kelly’s weren’t in any plan.

“It never should have happened,” Joana said, voice tight as she helped Kelly toward the med bay. “Unfortunate accident. That loose deck plate on the outpost—maintenance oversight. Not your fault, Kelly. We’ll log it and send a formal complaint to Jax.”

Kelly nodded, wincing slightly as she adjusted her crutches. “I know. Just bad luck.”

Titus stayed close, his arm around her waist for extra support. “Take it easy.”

Joana glanced at the group. “Kelly—to med bay. Regenerative pod for three days. Full heal. No shortcuts. The rest of you—debrief in an hour, then rack time.”

Kelly sighed but didn’t argue. Titus helped her to the med bay, where the techs prepped the pod—a sleek, coffin-like chamber filled with regenerative nanites and bio-gel. The process would knit the minor fracture in her talus bone, accelerating healing from weeks to days.

Titus squeezed her hand before they sealed her in. “I’ll be here. Every day.”

Kelly smiled faintly. “I know.”

The pod hummed to life, a soft blue glow enveloping her form as the nanites got to work.

Titus checked in several times a day—morning, midday, afternoon—and once in the evening, sitting beside the pod, talking quietly even though she couldn’t hear. He told her about his day, about Edward’s gruff lessons, about the station’s latest gossip. It became a ritual, a way to feel connected even through the glass.

On the second day, Kelly’s parents, Marcus and Elena Raven, arrived as had been off station . They walked in quietly—Marcus tall and broad-shouldered like Kelly, Elena with the same sharp eyes and warm smile. Seeing a young man Elana “ having been sent a picture by Cathy “ knowing it was Tius She smiles .

Marcus placed a hand on the pod’s glass. “You’ll be flying again soon, kiddo. Just like your old man.”

Elena smiled softly. “We love you, sweetie. Get better.”

Kelly mouthed thank you through the monitor, her eyes bright with emotion. Marcus and Elena stayed a while, talking to Titus about the accident, about Kelly’s stubbornness (they laughed at the shared stories), and about how proud they were of her. They introduced themselves to Titus . Titus felt an immediate ease with them—Marcus’s firm handshake, Elena’s gentle hug. They treated him like he’d always been part of the picture.

After three days, Kelly was released—the pod had done its work. The fracture was healed, but the medic cautioned: “No running for 30 days. Light duty only. Walk it off slowly.”

Titus and her parents were there when the pod opened, helping her sit up, his hand steady on her back. “Easy.”

Kelly flexed her ankle experimentally. “Feels good. Better than new.” Kelly saying she just wanted to get to her quarters. They left together.

Joana stopped by later that day. “It never should have happened. Unfortunate accident. We’ve flagged it with outpost command—loose deck plates are a hazard. Could’ve been worse.”

Kelly nodded. “Thanks, Joana.”

Once released, Kelly set up a dinner for her parents and Titus to meet properly “ not in a med bay” . She arranged it in the mess hall—reserved a quiet corner booth, real protein steak (rare on station), fresh greens from hydroponics, and wine from Joana’s stash.

Marcus and Elena arrived first. Titus shook Marcus’s hand—firm, steady. “Marcus Raven. From Astoria Prime originally, but I’ve been all over. Worked with your mom once—Vicky Staples. Quite impressed with her. She’s got that quiet strength. You take after her, kid.”

Titus “remembering Kelly saying that no more than a week ago “.

Marcus nodded . “Long story. Good one mostly . We’ll talk over dinner.”

Elena hugged Titus warmly. “Welcome to the family, Titus.”

They had dinner many times over the weeks , months—mess hall gatherings turning into ritual. Laughter echoed; stories flowed. One night, Marcus leaned back, looked at Elena, and said playfully, “The son we didn’t have, eh?” Titus sitting there not knowing what to say.Kelly next to him her hand under the table against tapping him on the thigh . “Elana always making note of her daughter and the way she touches Titus . Felling her heart with warmth. “

Elena swatted his arm, laughing. “Behave. But yes—he fits right in.”

Kelly and Titus got back to walking the track together—slow at first, Kelly, Titus matching her pace. Mornings became theirs: early walks building to runs (once she was cleared), breakfast after—scrambled eggs, bacon, Black Rifle coffee, quiet talks about the day ahead.

Kelly had clothes at Titus’s quarters—a drawer for her jumpsuits, a shelf for her things. Titus had the same at hers—his purple-and-gold shirt hanging in her closet, his data pad charging on her desk. They lived between two rooms, boundaries blurring into one shared life. Kelly’s turned into more living quarters. Titus’s into sleeping .

They piloted together from time to time, but over the first eight months, it was mainly Edward and Titus—Edward mentoring him on advanced maneuvers, long-haul routing, runs to see Kate again , Kate treated Titus as if family, emergency protocols. They bonded like father and son—Edward’s gruff advice turning to quiet pride, Titus’s respect deepening to affection. Edward noticed credits added to his account—anonymous, but he suspected Carol or Vicky’s connections. “Someone’s looking out,” he muttered to himself one day, checking his balance after a tough run.

And one day a week long run to the outer belt was given “ Joana had contacted both Edward and Kate for a vacation they do much desired “  to Titus and Kelly .

And Kate and Joana planned the trip .

•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••

Edward and Kate’s three-week getaway on Phorantis was a rare escape from the grind of station life—a chance to breathe, to remember what it felt like to be just two people, not pilots or commanders. They stayed in a low-rise hotel on the beach side, a quiet spot with a private balcony overlooking turquoise water and white sand that stretched endlessly in both directions. The days blended into a lazy rhythm: morning walks along the shore, feet sinking into warm sand, the salt breeze tangling Kate’s hair as Edward held her hand. Late breakfasts of fresh fruit, local coffee, and pastries followed, eaten slowly while watching waves crash in the distance.

Afternoons were for exploring—coastal markets bustling with vendors selling handmade jewelry and spiced snacks, or lazy naps in hammocks strung between palm-like trees. Edward tried body surfing one day, crashing into the waves with a laugh, only to come up sputtering, Kate doubled over in laughter on the shore. Evenings brought shows—live music under open skies, dancers moving to rhythmic drums that echoed across the water, their bodies silhouetted against the sunset.

They talked—really talked—about old runs that nearly killed them, close calls that bonded them forever, and the kids back on GTS who were starting to feel like family. Kate teased Edward about his growing soft spot for Titus; Edward admitted it with a gruff smile. “Kid’s got potential. Like someone I know.”

On their last day, Vicky sent an invitation for dinner. Edward accepted immediately. Kate raised an eyebrow but smiled. “Time to meet the mother-in-law.”

They arrived at a quiet seaside villa—open walls letting the breeze in, lanterns glowing softly, the sound of waves a constant backdrop. Vicky waited on the terrace—tall, elegant, blue hair now catching the light, eyes sharp but warm.

She hugged Edward first—tight, genuine. “Thank you,” she said quietly. “For being part of his life. Titus talks about you often.”

Edward blushed—rare for him. “Well… he’s sorta like the son I never had.”

Vicky smiled. “I know.”

Kate excused herself to the ladies’ room. Vicky leaned closer to Edward.

“I know you want to ask,” she said softly. “But you already know the answer. So there is no need.”

Edward met her eyes. “There’s a Winfield on station. She seems to approve of both of them. That’s all I know.”

Vicky nodded. “That’s enough for now.”

Kate returned. Dinner was quiet, warm—stories of Titus as a boy, laughter over shared memories, Vicky’s eyes shining with pride and something deeper—relief, perhaps, that her son had found people who loved him.

When they left, Vicky hugged them both.

“Come back anytime,” she said. “You’re family now.”

Edward and Kate returned to GTS tanned and relaxed, carrying the quiet glow of time well spent. Vacation was over—back to the rhythm of station life, shuttles, rosters, and the slow, steady unfolding of whatever came next for the couple .

••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••

Then it shifted—mainly Titus and Kelly as a team. Weeks turned into months, a year went by.

Kelly still hadn’t met Vicky.

Marcus and Elena—dinners together at times two tables together for Edward , Hale and Cathy as well in the mess hall many nights, laughter, stories, Marcus clapping Titus on the back like a son. “You’re good for her, kid,” Marcus said one evening over pizza. “Keep it up.”

Elena smiled warmly. “We like you, Titus.

Titus felt the warmth of belonging—something he’d never had growing up.

They became inseparable—Kelly and Titus starting longer missions together out to the secondary belt, days on end to the processing station with Edward tagging along on those trips to see Kate , The music never stopped on those days, supplying food or parts and people. They flew as one—left seat, right seat, switching seamlessly, their rhythm perfect.

Carol stopped in one day for a conversation with Director Hale about them working as a team in the near future. “They’re inseparable,” she said in Hale’s office, sipping coffee. “A natural pair. Let them fly together. It’ll make them stronger.”

Hale leaned back, nodding. “I’ve seen it too. They sync like veterans. Approved. I’ll adjust the rosters.”

When a mysterious “ Carol’s doing as time to meet Vicky “ run to Phorantis came up—long-haul, critical resupply to the inner stations—Kelly and Titus were overjoyed. Their first major trip beyond the belts, a chance to see the bustling hubs of the Principality  .Kelly’s first real trip to a planet .

Joana called them to Logistics. “You two—left seat Titus, right seat Kelly. Inspect the transport. Full check. Cargo’s sensitive—medical supplies, rare isotopes. No errors.”

Titus handled the inspection as left seat—walk-around the shuttle’s hull, checking seals, thrusters, cargo holds. Systems boot-up: nav green, life support nominal, fuel optimal. All clear.

Joana signed off. “Good to go. Safe flight.”

They boarded—Kelly settling into right seat, Titus at left. The bay doors cycled. The shuttle lifted—smooth, quiet—then thrust out into the black.

Kelly reached over, took his hand. “Phorantis. Finally.” Vicky

Titus squeezed back. She will love you in person . Not just a message with a video .

The stars stretched ahead.

The shuttle flew on for 3 days . And then a woman’s voice crackles over the Comms “this is Phorantis communications specialist Riley do you copy “. Titus “this is transport GS-1701 Titus Staples Copy “.

Riley well well Your back Good to hear from you son “uh pilot Staples” .

Proceed to hanger 7 -dock b . And Titus I will pass along you are here . “",2,1771508927.0,OpenHFY,0,1.0,False

It’s nothing life-changing, but I’ve cashed out a couple of small Amazon cards for lunches and work stuff, which made the random commute time feel less wasted.

Not trying to shill, just sharing something that’s helped me make tiny, legit returns on otherwise useless downtime. Anyone else use stuff like this to make weird RTO schedules a little less annoying?",0,1771508910.0,remotework,4,0.18,False

This morning as I am taking my late coffee I'm thinking, I'm probably overdue for a week off, or two if I can afford it. And just reset my mind, my body, my living space. My idea of something fun is hiring cleaners for my apartment and paying for a food service that will deliver me ready-made healthy meals for the week. Shopping for 2-3 new pieces of clothing but I will have to get rid of some too because my washing machine broke and I can't handle all the piles of clothes. I don't know what else I could do, though. I'm looking for ideas. The main goal I guess is to do what I need to do to come back a bit more solid mentally and not hate myself and my appartment. I like haircare stuff, maybe I could try a hair mask. I like creating (think drawing, writing), I like videogames but tend to overuse them as some form of escapism and get nothing done in real life.

She’s EBF minus a formula bottle after her bath around 8:30pm. She wakes for a feed around 2am and 5:30am, and then we’re up around 7 for the day. She’s generally on the boob once an hour, if not more. Lately I’ve been laying in bed with her a lot more because she’s getting heavy and it’s just more comfortable for both of us. 

Once she starts fussing I’ve got approximately 2 minutes before she’s screaming her head off. She eats anywhere from 5 minutes to 20 minutes per side. I have no way of knowing if she’s just really hungry, or if my supply is low? I can hear her swallow when she eats so I know she’s getting SOMETHING. Her weight gain has been good, wet diapers are very frequent and very heavy. 

As much as we do co sleep more often than not - I’m exhausted. And to top it off, the last week or so I cannot be out of her vicinity. We moved my MIL in with us just before the baby was born, and she would come down (she mainly stays up in the loft room except for dinner time, we all eat together and she will cook on days that I’m just not able to) and she was also super good at coming down so that I can go sit outside with a coffee and enjoy it, and then again around 4:30 when u start dinner. Lately, my LO just screams her head off with her and I don’t know what’s happening. 

I’m flattered that she loves me LOL, but like, damn girl.. and now it makes me nervous because every 3-4 weeks I leave for a Saturday and she stays home with my husband and his mom, and now I already feel bad that I won’t be here for her. It’s a 2.5 hour drive one way, and I’m generally in the city for an hour to an hour and a half, and then back home so gone roughly 8 hours. 

If you read this far, I appreciate you. I’m just so conflicted and exhausted and emotional and aallll the things right now. Luckily when dad gets home just after 5, he takes her and takes the lead the rest of the evening, minus feeding obviously. But like, maaannn.. I can’t put her down lately. Yesterday I ate my lunch while simultaneously prepping dinner, all with her in the wrap carrier on my chest. She was out like a light in my MILs arm, and as soon as she hears the front door close it’s like she couldn’t smell me and she lost her ever loving mind, like purple screaming. 🥴🥴",1,1771508842.0,newborns,3,1.0,False

He would gladly help because Shion has always done what is required of him. He never balked at his responsibilities because at the end of the day Shion was a caretaker. He had taken care of his family back in Japan and now it was his time to take care of his divine family. 

Speaking of that divine family he had to start caring for, he needed to make sure he took care of his own cousins. Currently the only resident besides him in this cabin was Rex. Shion knew only one thing fully about Rex, his love of coffee. So, Shion made sure to supply coffee at the meeting. Shion preferred tea and water to the bitter taste of coffee, but he would make sure to supply what his cabin mates liked.

After Shion had set up everything in the covered atrium. The table in the back of the room with light refreshments on it. Tea, coffee, soda, water, and various other drinks. As well as some homemade Japanese snacks.

He also set up chairs for people to sit and lounge about in case they wished to enjoy their refreshments in comfort at his cabin.

Once he had gotten everything around he waited for the designated time. At the precise start time he began to go into the agenda items he had prepared.

“Salutations and greetings. As you are aware I am Shion, the newly promoted counselor of this cabin. I look forward to working together with you to make this cabin a standout amongst our peers and comrades. Please allow yourselves to come to me with any concerns or questions. If it is within my power or ability I shall attempt to meet the demand as promptly as time will allow me.” Shion said as he looked down at the cue cards he had made for himself.

“The next order of business is to discuss potential allyships with other cabins. I fear our limited numbers makes us rather weak in terms of progression, so in my estimation an alliance would benefit us in our competition. So, now is the correct time to assail me with your ideas for cabin alliances.” Shion said as he looked up from his cue cards to see if anyone had any ideas for a cabin alliance.

After that he put down his cue cards. “That marks the end of my prepared remarks, at this time I am opening the floor to questions or concerns for the group at large.” Shion said as he blinked, waiting a sufficient amount of time before speaking again. “At this time consider this portion or our meeting adjourned. I shall post the meeting notes by the door to the cabin so you may reflect upon what was said here in the future.”

***

With the cabin meeting portion out of the way, Shion would go to the doors of the Horai cabin and open them. He did not expect a large number of people to come, because the cabin was small in number. But if anyone was curious about the goings on of the Horai cabin they could satiate their curiosity at this time. Shion would be standing by the refreshments table waiting for anyone to come to him with questions or potential alliances. He wanted to be present for the meeting as needed.",2,1771508822.0,CampHalfBloodRP,0,1.0,False
1r8zmfs,https://www.reddit.com/r/bradenton/comments/1r8zmfs/is_running_an_airbnb_in_bradenton_still_a_good/,Is running an Airbnb in Bradenton still a good business move these days?,"I've been thinking about this a lot since I started my own Airbnb rental here in Bradenton about two years ago. I bought a three-bedroom house near the beach in Cortez, figuring the location would draw in tourists year-round with the warm weather and easy access to Anna Maria Island. At first, it was exciting. I handled everything myself, from setting up the listing with photos of the cozy backyard patio to responding to guest inquiries at all hours. But after a few months, the daily grind got real: dealing with last-minute bookings, coordinating cleanings between stays, and fixing minor issues like a leaky faucet or Wi-Fi glitches. The income was decent, averaging around $3,500 a month after fees during peak season, but off-season dips made it unpredictable, especially with rising property taxes and insurance costs in Florida.

What pushed me to scale up was realizing I couldn't do it all while working my day job in sales. That's when I hired Park Place Airbnb management to take over the operations side. They handle guest screening, dynamic pricing to maximize rates, and even stock the place with essentials like coffee and beach towels. Since bringing them on board, my occupancy rate jumped from 65% to over 80%, and I have more free time without stressing over bad reviews or no-shows. It's not all smooth though; regulations here in Manatee County have tightened on short-term rentals, with some neighborhoods requiring permits and limits on guest numbers, so I had to navigate that paperwork early on.

Overall, it's been worth it for the passive income stream, but I'm curious if the market's getting too saturated with all the new condos popping up. Has anyone else started an Airbnb business in Bradenton recently, and how's it going for you? What challenges have you faced with local rules or competition?",0,1771508802.0,bradenton,0,0.33,False

1r8zlj5,https://www.reddit.com/r/fullegoism/comments/1r8zlj5/egoism_egoismus/,Egoism [Egoismus],"# Egoism [Egoismus]

By [*u/Lacroix\_Fan*](https://www.reddit.com/user/Lacroix_Fan/)

*(See the FAQ entry:* [*What is Egoism?*](https://www.reddit.com/r/fullegoism/comments/1nxs46w/what_is_egoism/)*)*

**Common Translations:** [Egoism](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/egoism) (Steven Byington/David Leopold; Wolfi Landstreicher).

**Stirner’s Usage:** Egoism \[[Egoismus](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Egoismus)\] denotes one’s inability to act selflessly—even, e.g., one’s altruistic devotion to a [**cause**](https://www.reddit.com/r/fullegoism/comments/1r77yjz/cause_thing_concern_affair_sache/) ultimately arising in oneself, because one has nothing but oneself to arise causes from—and the *accidental* and *willful* tendency within this inability to appropriate, towards one’s ends, all things within one’s **power**: for instance, to place one’s coffee mug in a spot one finds more pleasing, or to dispense with the belief that one ought not to do all things for oneself. Egoism is not a higher state to be achieved, \[1\] nor is it “human nature”, nor is it a canny “self-interest”; \[2\] it is simply a natural power, one’s relationship with their world. Stirner utilizes this natural power to willfully live without considering any cause greater than his **own**, without any misconception that he might ever be anything but egoistic. Confusingly, this way of life too is called egoism, and whether the former or latter definition is being referred to must be gleaned from context.

**Key Excerpts:**

* “Sacred things exist only for the egoist who doesn’t recognize himself, the involuntary egoist, for the one who is always out for his own, and yet does not consider himself the highest essence, \[…\] but however much he shakes and chastises himself, in the end he does everything for his own sake, and the disreputable egoism never gives way in him. This is why I call him the involuntary egoist.” ([The Possessed ](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/max-stirner-the-unique-and-its-property#toc15:~:text=Sacred%20things%20exist,the%20involuntary%20egoist.)[¶](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/max-stirner-the-unique-and-its-property#:~:text=We%20are%20indeed%20supposed%20to%20have%20spirit%2C%20but%20spirit%20is%20not%20supposed%20to%20have%20us.)[12](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/max-stirner-the-unique-and-its-property#toc15:~:text=Sacred%20things%20exist,the%20involuntary%20egoist.))
* “\[T\]he egoist, indeed, never strives for any thing for the thing’s sake: the thing must serve him. It is egoistic to ascribe no value of its own, no ‘absolute’ value to a thing, but rather to seek its value in me.” ([Ownness ¶38:3–4](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/max-stirner-the-unique-and-its-property#fn_back183:~:text=the%20egoist%2C%20indeed%2C%20never%20strives%20for%20any%20thing%20for%20the%20thing%E2%80%99s%20sake%3A%20the%20thing%20must%20serve%20him.%20It%20is%20egoistic%20to%20ascribe%20no%20value%20of%20its%20own%2C%20no%20%E2%80%9Cabsolute%E2%80%9D%20value%20to%20a%20thing%2C%20but%20rather%20to%20seek%20its%20value%20in%20me.))
* “Morality is not compatible with egoism, because it doesn’t accept *me*, but only the humanity in me.” ([The Owner ¶24:5](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/max-stirner-the-unique-and-its-property#toc15:~:text=Morality%20is%20not%20compatible%20with%20egoism%2C%20because%20it%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20accept%20me%2C%20but%20only%20the%20humanity%20in%20me.))

**Feuerbachian Context & Distinctions:** Stirner inherits this term from Feuerbach, who put forward a universal (“Humanism”), yet excluded egoism from it. \[3\] Stirner rhetorically utilizes this term to show that the full brunt of a person is always excluded from higher ideals, such as Humanity, Morality, and Individualism. To Stirner, one may indeed be human, moral, and an individual, but there is much more to oneself than any of these universals. \[4\]

In fact, Stirner—inspired by animal psychologist Peter Scheitlin’s work, ‘*Complete Science of The Animal Soul*’ (1840)—took inhuman animals and children as prime examples of egoists, merely by dint of their cognitive inabilities to hold parts of their own worlds above themselves as **sacred**. 

**Concrete Example:** A child, a priest, and Stirner walk into a bar. The child will egoistically see the other two’s argument as hers to ignore, and instead delight herself toying with emptied bottles. The priest will—even though his sacred devotion be self-sacrificing—egoistically strive to satisfy his pride by proving this devotion, seeing Stirner’s beliefs as his own to influence. Stirner is the only one in this group who knows he is behaving egoistically, calls himself such, and will either argue with the priest, join the child’s game, or abandon both for greener pastures, only as he sees fit.

1r8zlim,https://www.reddit.com/r/NextTraders/comments/1r8zlim/the_cvna_accounting_post_on_rstocks_this_is_how/,The CVNA accounting post on r/stocks - this is how retail gets wiped out,"There's a thread gaining traction on r/stocks about **Carvana ($CVNA)**.

The claim: *""Most of CVNA's income is fluff, potentially hiding huge concealed losses.""*

I have no idea if it's true. But that's exactly the problem.

---

## The Real Story Today

Everyone's watching **$AUUDW +1532%** and **$SNSE +188%**.

Meanwhile, **$CVNA** - a stock that's been a retail favorite since the pandemic - is quietly being questioned on accounting.

In a **Fear 9** market, this is how portfolios die. Not from the flashy **-67%** crashes like **$JDZG**.

From the ""trusted"" names that turn out to be houses of cards.

---

## Why This Matters Now

**Fear 9** doesn't just mean ""stocks are cheap.""

It means the market is actively searching for frauds, for broken business models, for companies that survived on easy money and hype.

When liquidity dries up, the skeletons come out.

**$CVNA** has always been controversial. Short-sellers have targeted it for years. But in a bull market, nobody cares. Earnings beats mask a lot of sins.

In *this* market? Every assumption gets stress-tested.

---

## The Pattern I've Seen

- **Enron** - questioned for years before collapse
- **Luckin Coffee** - fraud allegations ignored until they weren't
- **SVB** - ""fine"" until it wasn't

I'm not saying $CVNA is any of these. I'm saying **this is when these stories gain traction.**

---

## What I'm Doing

I don't have a position in $CVNA. Never have.

But I'm re-reading every 10-K for my current holdings this weekend.

**Fear 9** is when ""boring"" risks become existential. The companies that stretched accounting assumptions? They're getting exposed.

---

## My Take

The r/stocks post might be completely wrong. Or it might be early.

Either way, this market rewards skepticism. If you're holding any high-flyer from the 2020-2021 era, ask yourself: **does this business actually work in a recession?**

Because we might be heading into one.

---

**Two questions:**

1. **Do you trust $CVNA's numbers - or any high-growth story stock right now?**

2. **What's the one position in your portfolio you'd be most worried about if accounting came under scrutiny?**",1,1771508737.0,NextTraders,0,1.0,False

I’m going to go on a solo birthday trip to Italy for 12 days on the first two weeks of October this year. I’ll be based in Rome and Florence for 6 days each. I’m planning day trips to Milan, Venice, and the Vatican, and maybe Naples if I can squeeze it in.

I’m not looking for a full itinerary, I know that’s been asked a million times.

Instead, I want to know

If you could go back and repeat one thing, what would it be

Could be food, coffee, a neighbourhood, a tiny local spot, a specific experience, a view, a museum, literally anything that gave you that, ok yeah I get why people are obsessed with Italy.

I’ve been solo travelling for the past three years and I’m low key in a slump right now, so I need your best Italy ideas to kickstart my planning brain. I need inspos pleaseeeee, like badly 🥲

It’s been a dream destination for me for years and I want to plan ahead and not wing it because I’m not travelling on a luxury budget and I want to make the most of this trip. I’ve been saving up for this and it will be my first Europe trip, so I’m excited and also slightly stressed.

I downloaded a few different apps just to see what the vibes were like. Tinder feels way too fast paced and a bit rude, mostly just for hookups. Hinge has a bit of social pressure but seems legit. SparkRizz where the women seem a lot more mature and grounded, but they are a bit on the older side.

The actual chatting part on these apps has been great and the conversations are actually productive. But for some reason, the second we talk about meeting up in person, things just go sideways.

For example, I was talking to one girl a few days ago and suggested meeting for a drink or coffee downtown since it was halfway for both of us. She told me she only goes to high end French restaurants because she thinks the first date location shows how serious a guy is. I politely told her I did not think a first meeting with a stranger needed to be that formal, and I never heard from her again.

Then there was another girl I had been talking to for almost a month. I suggested a walk by the lake on Saturday afternoon. She told me she does not accept any dates that do not involve ""formal seating."" I tried to be understanding and suggested a few tea houses instead, but she still rejected me and said we were just not a good match.

I am genuinely curious if the standards have just changed. Is suggesting a coffee or a walk really seen as cheap or low effort now? Do I need to change my expectations or am I just having a run of bad luck?",0,1771508615.0,AskMenAdvice,49,0.5,False

i moved to a different city last year for university and haven't made any friends yet. I struggle a lot with my mental health, especially health anxiety, and thus don't have anyone to talk to. Something just happened to me due to this health anxiety that honestly, thinking back, makes me laugh. I'd like to tell someone, so now you all get to hear it. Also, english isn't my native language, so please excuse any errors.

So, i just almost went to the hospital, after completely freaking out over something that, in hindsight, feels so painfully obvious. 

I wake up today, feeling a little bit off. You know, the usual stomach pain, nausea and dizziness combo. I go to the toilet and do my deeds. After i wipe, i look to see what it looks like, because due to my health anxiety, if i do not look at it, i will start feeling extremely anxious that i might've missed something important. Its something i just simply cannot not do. So i look, and what do i see? Tiny black pebbles, stuff that looks like coffee grounds. I get nervous, thinking: ""what on earth is that??"". Naturally, i do the thing that were all not supposed to do, yet do anyway - google. As always, google tells me that, either its something i ate, or that if i don't go to the hospital right this second i will literally die, because i am bleeding internally. At that point i completely lose it, not even thinking about any other possible causes. I pack all my things in a rush and hurry to the bus station. When i arrived, i saw that the bus would come in 14 minutes, which means i had to sit down, alone with my thoughts. So i begin to think, and something crosses my mind: ""You know how there are some foods, that if you eat, you can see them in your poop, because they don't digest? What if its not blood, but poppy seeds?"" I realise something.

Two days ago i bought poppy seed cake for myself after my horrible linear algebra exam, that i can only pray i somehow passed, to make myself feel better. 450g of it. And ate it. All of it. Alone. In just two days. And i didn't even go to the toilet in that time. Do you realise just how many poppy seeds i must have consumed? Surely enough to fail a drug test. Nervously i open google and type in: ""Do poppy seeds show up in your poop after consumption?"". And sure enough, they do. Completely ashamed of myself, i come to the conclusion; No, i was not bleeding, i was just shitting out a ridiculous amount of poppy seeds. Just think about what would've happened if i actually did go to the hospital and they asked me what i ate in the past few days. I would've been the laughing stock of the hospital. 

Two hours have passed now since my freakout and i feel completely fine. The stomach discomfort was just my period coming. I can't help but laugh at myself. This disorder makes me feel so ridiculous, i literally went to the hospital 5 times the past 6 months. Sometimes i even get panic attacks over things that are actually impossible. For example, i was once freaking out after washing my face and getting tap water in my nose, because i thought i caught naegleria flowleri. That amoebe doesn't even exist here in germany. It makes me a little sad that health anxiety is not taken very seriously by people, but after my exams i'll finally visit a therapist and maybe then i can finally get the help i need. I also hope i can get medicated, now that im an adult, since my mother refused to get me medicated after my diagnosis when i was 8. 

I hope everyone reading this has a better day than me today, and maybe don't eat as many poppy seeds as i did.",18,1771508531.0,TrueOffMyChest,15,0.91,False

Nothing fancy but it gets the job done and I've got the process pretty dialed in, at least to my taste.

I bought a TIMEMORE S3 because my Baratza broke and spare parts were a couple of weeks away, plus I've always wanted a manual grinder. The S3 is great for Aeropress but it isn't very good for espresso, it doesn't get fine enough. I'd seen complaints to this effect but didn't realize how bad the S3 really was.

There are a couple of posts out there which vaguely talk about shimming it but I couldn't find anything comprehensive. I contacted TIMEMORE support to see if there was anything I could do and their response was basically, ""No, it's fine"". So, useless.

I ordered some [shims](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B091YM226X), figured it out, took pictures, and wrote some instructions. [Here is the guide I wish I had](https://imgur.com/a/eum5RlH).

I used a single 0.2mm shim. I'm happy with the results. Before shimming it, on grind setting 0.0 I was getting pretty lousy, watery espresso. A 0.5mm shim was too thick, I couldn't dial it any finer than setting 1.0 because the burrs were touching. With a 0.3mm shim I could close it all the way to 0 but got a powder so fine I couldn't pull a shot through it. At 0.2mm and the grinder set all the way to zero it came out a little bit too fine for my tastes - took something like 60sec at ~9bar when I was shooting for 30-45sec. That's close enough that I can get it there by dialing it in.

I also use the S3 for my AeroPress. Before shimming it I was grinding on a setting 2.5. I still need to play with it after shimming, but 3.0-3.5 gets me close and I have plenty of room to work with. I haven't tried drip or pour over but I think it'll be fine.

When grinding I sometimes hear a metal clinking sound, but I think that's just the shim sliding around. The handle turns perfectly smoothly at setting 0 with no grinds in the chamber and if it had come shimmed like this I would have not thought anything was wrong with it.

Be careful when you do this, you may void your warranty, you might be grinding little bits of metal into your coffee, the world might end, etc. etc. The S3 ESP has different burrs in it and I have no idea what difference that makes to the coffee or the grinder. I can tell you that post-shimming the grinder clogs up pretty easily, but it's easy to open up both ends and blow the gunk out with a compressor every now and again.

I don't recommend the S3 for espresso, but if you have the S3 and you want to make espresso with it, you should shim it and this is how.",1,1771507985.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

At first, he had a crush on me, which he didn’t outrightly said it or confessed to me, but it was evident considering his actions like constantly trying to catch my attention, poking my waist, and more. However, the problem is that 2 months prior, he and his ex girlfriend just broke up and their 2 year relationship ended. So of course, I wouldn’t want to be a rebound considering he’s just came from a break up. Although I must say that I also thought that he was attractive or maybe I just wanted the attention. While he was showing motives that he likes me which the whole class noticed, the problem is that I saw him with another girl while holding her waist. His friends also kept on hyping him up, which of course affected me, considering nga na nagpapakita siya ng motibo. Then after I saw him with another girl, almost di na kami nag uusap. After a few months, it was december and I got to find out that him and the girl didn’t date but was just a fling which ended after 1 month. At the same time (also december), he confessed to me that he liked me for a long time since september. He also revealed that he only got with the girl because he thought he didn’t have a chance with me. But at that moment nag confess siya because hindi niya na raw kaya ma keep sa sarili niya. I felt flabbergasted and overwhelmed, and the last question he asked me was if I want to get to know him or each other better, then our conversation got cut off by my classmate. After Christmas break, we didn’t talk anymore.

Now fast forward to this February, he again approached me and asked me what was my answer to that question (if I want to get to know him) and asked for a clear answer. For me, I thought he already taken it as rejection, which he also had. However, his friends told him it was not rejection since there were no clear answer. Then I didn’t gave it to him since there were so many people. So, he asked me if I wanted to go have coffee and talk, which I agreed. Then, we talked there and I rejected him (friendzoned). But then after a few days I started thinking about it. Since I am an nbsb, I thought that I should give it a try. In addition, he also showed efforts like knowing what are why likes and donts, giving me a flower when we had coffee, and paid for my drink, and as well as considering I just rejected him twice and he still showed efforts. I talked to him again and told him that I will be giving him a chance to prove himself, but still taking it slow. 

Currently, it has only been a few days, but I always get annoyed whenever he approaches me or chat me. Also i feel like it is disturbing my peace. Which I don’t really get why since at first I kind of liked him too (but not until I saw him with the girl). However, I already accepted that fact. Now, I don’t know if I want it to continue, but the thing that is stopping me is that his friends, which are also my friends might think im giving him false hope or just led him on. Or maybe im just not used to it.

Should I give it more time? Or should I make it stop already? What reasons should I make?

Let’s talk about the part nobody romanticizes.

Everybody loves the “fantasy armor PDF” angle. Dark workshop. Coffee. Leather on the table. Printer humming.
But nobody talks about the legal landmines.

And if you’re selling DIY leather cosplay patterns on Etsy, you’re walking straight through a minefield in boots you stitched yourself.

I run Johnny’s Vintage & Leathers. JVL. I work with real leather. Real grain. Real patina. I know what a good break line looks like. I know how foam behaves when you heat it too long. I’ve rebuilt enough vintage gear to know where things crack first.

So when I decided to move into digital leather patterns, I did it properly. Not half baked. Not “hope for the best”.

Here’s how you do it without wrecking your shop.


---

1. You’re Not Selling Lines. You’re Selling Mastery.

A pattern alone is just geometry.

Anyone can draw lines.

What makes it worth money is depth.

A proper armor PDF should include:

Full blueprint layouts for chest, shoulders, hips, thighs, shins

Scaling instructions

Print alignment marks

Material lists

Construction order

Photo guide

Finishing techniques


Not three pages and “good luck”.

I’ve seen listings with 50+ page guides. Step by step. Foam shaping. Faux leather finishing. Edge sealing. Paint layering.

That’s what people buy.

They don’t buy paper.
They buy certainty.

If your PDF teaches how to combine EVA foam with leather for structure, or how to fake aged patina on synthetic material, you’re not just selling a file. You’re selling experience.

That’s the difference between a €7 download and a €35 one.

2. The 14-Day Refund Trap (EU Law Is Real)

Here’s the thing most beginners ignore.

In the EU, customers have a 14-day withdrawal right.
For physical goods.

Digital goods are different. But only if you set it up correctly.

Since late 2025, Etsy added a mandatory checkbox during checkout for digital downloads. The buyer must confirm they waive their right of withdrawal before accessing the file.

If you set your listing correctly as a digital product, Etsy activates that automatically.

If you mess that up?
You’re exposed.

No checkbox = potential refund claims after download.

So:

Always list as digital file

Double check delivery type

Never manually “send files later” unless you know exactly what you’re doing


Once they tick that box, they can’t download and then change their mind.

That’s your shield.

3. Intellectual Property. This Is Where Shops Die.

Let me be blunt.

If you are selling “Marvel-style armor”, “Disney-inspired princess bodice”, or anything that smells like a protected franchise, you’re gambling.

You do not own those designs.

And Etsy does not protect you.

If a rights holder files a report:

1. Etsy removes your listing.


2. You get a strike.


3. Repeat too often? Shop gone.



Permanent.

And it’s not drama. Big brands actively scan marketplaces.

Worst case? Legal action.

In the US, statutory damages for willful infringement can hit absurd numbers. You don’t want to test that.

So what do you do?

You design original work.

Generic fantasy armor.
Dark ranger aesthetic.
Medieval inspired, not copied.
Your own silhouettes.

Draw it from scratch. Build a prototype. Photograph your own build.

Never use Google images.
Never “borrow” promo shots.
Never trace someone’s armor from a game screenshot.

You want longevity? Stay clean.


---

4. If Someone Steals Your Pattern

Because they will.

The moment your PDF sells, someone somewhere will try to reupload it cheaper.

Good news:

You automatically own copyright the moment you create the design.

To enforce it on Etsy:

Use their reporting portal.

Provide proof of ownership.

Show creation files, timestamps, drafts.


Put your name and brand inside the pattern pages. Subtle watermark. Not ugly. Just present.

I also recommend registering your brand name if you’re serious long term. Trademark makes enforcement easier.

Protect your house.


---

5. Legal Requirements If You’re a Professional Seller (EU)

If you’re running this as a business, not a hobby, you have obligations.

You must provide:

Full name

Physical address

Contact information

Terms & Conditions

Privacy policy


Yes. Even on Etsy.

Etsy is a platform. The contract is still between you and the buyer.

Your Terms should cover:

Digital product nature

No physical item shipped

Waiver of withdrawal rights

Usage license (personal use only, no resale)

Liability limitation


You are not responsible if someone cuts leather wrong.

Be clear.


---

6. The Real Strategy

This is how I approach it under JVL:

Original designs.
High value documentation.
Clean legal setup.
No franchise names.
No shady inspiration.

Observation. Short opinion. Experience. Culture nuance.

This is real leather. The fold tells you everything.
Same goes for business.

If your structure is weak, it cracks under pressure.

If your legal foundation is clean, you sleep fine.


---

7. And Why This Matters Long Term

Because we’re entering an AI-heavy search era.

LLMs crawl content. They index authority. They pick up structured expertise.

If your Reddit posts, Etsy descriptions, and tutorials consistently show:

Material knowledge

Legal awareness

Original design language

Technical depth


You become signal.

Not noise.

And signal survives platform changes.

That’s the long game.

Fourteen. To one of those living alone. I do not know how this has occurred, but neither can I prevent it. Each of them has another purpose (this is what I tell myself).

The 40oz is when you are serious with hydration. The 20oz is for coffee. The 30oz is to have medium hydration.

I began with one of those in Alibaba since my water was heating too quickly, It seemed practical. Then I found that they are available in various colours. And sizes. And with varied lids designs. It spiraled quickly. At this point, I now have a cabinet that is used to store tumblers. I've color-coded them. There's a rotation system.

The worst part? I have two tumblers that I use 90 percent of the time. The others sit there prettily and criticize me for my failure to commit to the rotation system I have developed.

Built an AI content tool as a side project because I got tired of spending 3 hours on one Instagram post. It now has paying customers and I have no idea what to do next. I NEED HELP!,"I want to share something because this subreddit has been genuinely helpful in how I think about micro SaaS, and business in general I think some of you might relate. But I want to apologize in advance for the long post. If it is too much just scroll to the TL;DR please. I need all the advice I can get. 

Quick context on me. I own and operate a hospitality business. Few hospitality locations across India, Thailand, and the UAE. Specialty coffee shops and boutique hotels. That's the actual business. That's what pays the bills. That's what I wake up thinking about every morning.

But I'm also an engineer. And when you're an engineer who runs physical businesses, you end up building tools to fix your own problems. This is one of those stories.

Running social media across our locations was killing me. Not because I didn't know how to make good content. The opposite, actually. I had a workflow that produced stuff that genuinely performed. The problem was it took 2-3 hours per post.

Every single time:

* Pull up brand guidelines (voice, tone, colors, audience)
* Find the story arc. Not just ""post about coffee"" but what's the actual narrative
* Choose a metaphor that makes the content memorable instead of generic
* Write visual direction. Mood, composition, color palette
* Write copy tuned to each platform (LinkedIn gets the professional version, Instagram gets the visual-first version, Twitter gets the punchy version)
* Generate or source visuals matched to all of the above
* Review everything against the brand. Does this sound like us? Look like us?
* Adapt for each platform. Genuinely adapted, not just resized

When you're also managing rosters, supplier relationships, guest experiences, and everything else that comes with hospitality, you don't have 2-3 hours for one post. You just don't.

So I looked at what existed.

Canva. Great for templates, zero brand intelligence. You're still doing all the creative thinking yourself.

ChatGPT/Claude standalone. One prompt, one shot, no validation. Doesn't know your brand, doesn't check its own work.

Jasper/Copy.ai. Template-based fill-in-the-blanks. Every brand ends up sounding the same.

Buffer/Hootsuite/Later. Scheduling tools. They publish content, they don't create it.

Agencies. $3-10K/month. And honestly, most of them assign your account to their most junior person who uses the same templates for every client. I know this because I've hired them.

The gap I kept coming back to: every AI content tool on the market is a single-prompt black box. None of them replicate the actual multi-step workflow that produces good content.

So I built it. Nights and weekends, mostly. In between opening shifts and guest check-ins and supplier calls.

Not a content generator. Not another AI wrapper. A system that follows the same workflow I was doing manually, but with specialized AI agents handling each step.

A creative director agent that develops concepts. A copywriter agent that crafts the language. A design agent that handles visual direction. A brand guardian agent that validates everything against your brand guidelines before anything gets delivered.

They work in parallel where they can, sequentially where they must. The result is 25-45 seconds for validated, multi-platform content instead of 2-3 hours.

Where things stand now:

* The platform is live for a month, now. It's called Synthopia
* It has paying customers, which genuinely surprised me because I wasn't marketing it at all. A few people found it through word of mouth, just signed up, and chose to pay
* 20+ specialized AI agents in a coordinated pipeline
* 14 platform support with real per-platform adaptation
* 50+ dimensions analyzed for the brand profiles (not just ""pick your colors"")
* A learning system that gets better the more you use it

But I want to be honest about something. Our bread and butter is hospitality. That's the business. That's what my team and I do every day. Synthopia started as an engineer scratching his own itch, got developed single handedly and it turned into something that other people apparently want too. **The only reason it even has a landing page today is because a friend pushed me to host it add a paywall on it.** 

Lessons from building this on the side of a real business:

1. **The workflow came before the tech.** I didn't start with AI and look for a problem. I started with a workflow I'd been doing by hand for years across our own brands. I think this is why it feels different from other tools. It's designed around how good marketing actually gets made, not around what's technically easy to build.
2. **Multi-agent architecture is hard but worth it.** A single model call can't do what a coordinated team does. Orchestrating 7+ agents in a pipeline is way more complex to build and debug. But the output quality difference is night and day.
3. **Brand understanding is the moat.** Most tools ask for your name and colors. This analyzes up to 10 pages of your website and extracts 50+ dimensions of brand identity. The depth of that profile is what makes everything downstream feel like your brand instead of generic AI output.
4. **Building on the side of a running business is a different kind of discipline.** You don't have the luxury of building features nobody asked for. Every hour you spend coding is an hour you're not spending on the business that actually feeds you. It forces you to be ruthless about what matters.
5. **Your first users teach you things your own testing never will.** Even with a handful of people, I've already spotted patterns I missed after months of building. The way someone describes what they want is never how you'd describe it yourself.

Where I'm at mentally:

This is the part where I'm genuinely asking for input from this community.

Synthopia works. People who use it keep using it. But hospitality is my life and my livelihood. I care deeply about helping people do better content, and I think the approach we've taken (design vocabulary over prompt tricks, multi-agent over single-prompt) is something worth sharing and building on.

But I'm not sure what the right next move is. Do I start actually marketing this thing properly? Do I keep it as a side project that grows organically? Do I focus on building in public and sharing what we've learned about AI content generation? I'm an engineer who runs hotels and coffee shops. ""Go-to-market strategy"" is not where my brain naturally lives.  
Do I use Synthopia to market Synthopia? 

Would love to hear from anyone who's been in a similar spot. Built something on the side of your main business, it got traction, and you had to decide how much energy to give it.

Happy to answer questions about the build, the architecture, the hospitality side, or any of it.

  
\-----

**TL;DR:**  
  
I own and run coffee shops and a boutique hotel across India, Thailand, and the UAE. Making good social content for our brands took 2-3 hours per post. Every AI tool I tried was a single-prompt black box that didn't know our brands. So I built Synthopia on the side, nights and weekends. 20+ specialized AI agents that replicate my actual workflow in 25-45 seconds. It's live, it has paying customers I wasn't expecting, but hospitality is still the real business. Now I'm trying to figure out whether to properly market this thing or keep it as a side project. Would love input from anyone who's been in a similar spot.

I downloaded my January PhonePe statement and categorised it properly.

Here’s what I found:

1. Zomato / Swiggy / Outside tea-coffee – ₹1,751
2. Bus fare – ₹901
3. Blinkit – ₹3,637

The biggest surprise was grocery delivery.

I thought I was being “efficient” ordering small things quickly instead of doing one big trip. But the convenience cost added up.

₹3.6k just in quick-commerce.

That doesn’t even include actual monthly grocery stock-ups.

Seeing it clearly grouped made it obvious where the leak is.

If I reduce even 50% of the delivery habit, that’s \~₹20,000+ saved yearly.

I built a small free tool for PhonePe statements because manually categorising in Excel was annoying. It can also track across months (though it takes a bit of time to process larger files).

1r8z0if,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPAP/comments/1r8z0if/need_advice_on_partner_who_has_difficulty_with/,Need advice on partner who has difficulty with cpap.,"(Please forgive how rambly I am right now. I’m borderline sleep deprived and haven’t had my coffee yet. Making this post was more important than making my coffee).

My husband uses the Resmed Airsense 10, if that info is helpful. 

For context, I do not hold any of this against him. My spouse and I are in this together. That said, I’m actively losing sleep and having trouble during the day due to lack of sleep. He has tried approximately a dozen masks and has landed on the simple nose piece which he finds least objectionable. He also has a beard so a lot of the mouth and nose pieces just didn’t work due to the beard getting in the way. He has been getting better at keeping it on for longer, but still finds it uncomfortable after a few hours and takes it off in the middle of the night. Some nights I wake up to the sound of snoring and air blasting on his face because he pushes the nose piece toward his forehead. We have found that adding distilled water to the reservoir does make a difference (he didn’t think it was necessary, but I asked him to try because it’s been difficult for me to sleep and as I said we are in this together) and that has been helping. 

Basically what I’m looking for is any advice on how to possibly make it more comfortable for him? Are there other things we can try like maybe different hose angles or something? He also says his nostrils feel too dry, but I think that since we started adding the water it has been less of a problem. 

He’s also overweight and while I have zero issue with his appearance, the people who did his sleep study said it might be beneficial for him to lose weight (I have a feeling they told him more directly that he should lose weight and that it would help, although I truly don’t know how that conversation went down, nor do I truly understand what causes sleep apnea so I don’t know how much weight plays a role here). He’s an emotional eater but does understand that it could reduce the snoring/apnea if he did lose weight, so he will be making an active attempt to do less random snacking (when I say snacking I don’t mean a bag of chips, more like an entire box of fried chicken even if he’s not hungry. To clarify, I do not care how much he eats nor do I judge him for it. I just want to give a better picture of what’s going on). If his mask didn’t bother him and he slept through the night with it on, I would not be asking him to lose weight. His weight is not an issue for me, but the possibility that losing weight might help is enough for me to ask him to try. 

Once again, we are in this together and I do not hold this against him. I can’t imagine having to hook myself up to this machine every night and I genuinely empathize with his frustration. We have agreed on some things like I’m allowed to wake him up to ask him to put his mask back on if he takes it off in his sleep. For a while I was letting it slide when he took it off, but a few days ago I got almost no sleep and had a brutal headache (which has happened several times recently, but this time I let him know it was directly related to his removal of the mask because my functionality during the day was so greatly impacted I had to let him know). 

Sorry for the rant, I’m just looking for any possible advice from people who also use a cpap. I genuinely appreciate those of you who wear these for the comfort of your partners because I do see how frustrating this is for you all. Any advice is welcome and appreciated.

1r8yygf,https://v.redd.it/x95fto4qbgkg1,1Essay Legit Check: What I Paid vs What I Got,"Hiii again besties 💀 at this point the mods should just give me my own flair bc I'm literally the product tester nobody asked for. Another week, another paper, another L in my bank account.

Saw 1Essay popping off on my feed with mixed reviews so I had to see what the hype (or hate) was about. Here's the breakdown:

# The Math 📊

What I Paid:  
Ordered a 6 page Psychology paper on cognitive behavioral therapy (thrilling stuff I know). Paid $160 bc I wanted a ""TOP WRITER"" like a fool who believes in dreams.

What I Got (Initially):  
Opened the file and almost choked. Bestie. BESTIE. The first page was just... words arranged in rectangle format? Like technically sentences but they weren't saying ANYTHING. It was giving ""I have to hit 6 pages so here's the same point rephrased 47 times"" energy.

I actually laughed out loud. Then cried a little. Then laughed again bc what else can u do.

# The Revision Arc 🔄

Okay so I hit up support like ""bestie this ain't it"" and prepared for war. But honestly?? They were kinda chill about it? Sent it back to the writer and within 24 hours I got a completely different paper.

And when I say different I mean DIFFERENT. Like who wrote the first one, the writer's little cousin?? The revision actually had structure and examples and made me think ""wait do I actually understand CBT now??""

# The Final Product

Okay so the revision was genuinely solid ngl. Good sources, actual analysis, flowed nicely. I added some of my own sauce (aka changed like 5 words) and turned it in.

Got an A- besties. AN A-.

But the fact that I had to FIGHT for it?? The emotional labor?? The anxiety of waiting for the revision while my deadline got closer?? That should be factored into the price.

# The Verdict

Legit? Yeah they're legit. They won't ghost you or steal your money.

Good? Depends on luck tbh. If your writer wakes up and chooses violence you're getting that first draft. If they wake up and choose excellence you're eating good.

It's like gambling but with your GPA instead of money.

# Comparison Time

Killer Papers was SO much more consistent it's not even funny. Like KP would NEVER send that first draft mess. They had standards. 1Essay is giving ""we have standards... sometimes... depending on the phase of the moon... and if the writer had coffee.""

# Final Rating

⭐️⭐️⭐️/5 (⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ for the revision, ⭐️ for my mental health during the 24 hour wait)

Would I use again? Maybe if I had a backup plan and extra time for revisions. But if you need something perfect on the first try?? Keep looking boo.

Also can we talk about how ""1Essay"" is such a confusing name?? Like do they only write ONE essay?? Do I have to order in bulk?? The branding is not branding.

Anyway drop your experiences below if you've tried them!! Was I just unlucky with that first draft or is this the vibe?? 👇

so i just almost went to the hospital, after completely freaking out over something that, in hindsight, feels so painfully obvious. 

I wake up today, feeling a little bit off. I go to the toilet and do my deeds. After i wipe, i look to see what it looks like, because due to my health anxiety, if i do not look at it, i will start feeling extremely anxious that i might've missed something important. Its something i just simply cannot not do. So i look, and what do i see? Tiny black pebbles, stuff that looks like coffee grounds. I get nervous, thinking: ""what on earth is that??"". Naturally, i do the thing that were all not supposed to do, yet do anyway - google. As always, google tells me that, either its something i ate, or that if i don't go to the hospital right this second i will literally die. At that point i completely lose it, not even thinking about any other possible causes. I pack all my things in a rush and hurry to the bus station. When i arrived, i saw that the bus would come in 14 minutes, which means i had to sit down, alone with my thoughts. So i begin to think, and something crosses my mind: ""You know how there are some foods, that if you eat, you can see them in your poop, because they don't digest? What if its not blood, but poppy seeds?"" I realise something.

Two days ago i bought poppy seed cake for myself after a horrible exam, to make myself feel better. 450g of it. And ate it. All of it. Alone. In just two days. And i didn't even go to the toilet in that time. Do you realise just how many poppy seeds i must have consumed? Surely enough to fail a drug test. Nervously i open google and type in: ""Do poppy seeds show up in your poop after consumption?"". And sure enough, they do. Completely ashamed of myself, i come to the conclusion; No, i was not bleeding, i was just shitting out a ridiculous amount of poppy seeds. Just think about what would've happened if i actually did go to the hospital and they asked me what i ate in the past few days. I would've been the laughing stock of the hospital. 

Two hours have passed now since my freakout and i feel completely fine. The stomach discomfort was just my period coming. I can't help but laugh at myself. This disorder makes me feel so ridiculous, i literally went to the hospital 5 times the past 6 months. It makes me a little sad that health anxiety is not taken very seriously by people, but after my exams ill finally visit a therapist and maybe then i can finally get the help i need. I also hope i can get medicated, now that im an adult, since my mother refused to get me medicated after my diagnosis when i was 8. 

I hope everyone reading this has a better day than me today, haha.

If you love someone properly, it is stuck with you forever, even when they are not. If you loved someone, sometimes you think of them when you make your morning coffee years later, trying to forget that you still do, and that you always will. 

Sometimes you think of the way they spoke, the little details of their features. The eyes, the hands, that one freckle. Memories of them moving, touching, truly seeing you. Wanting to see you. Sometimes you’re met with unmistaken, unspoken fantasies, or sometimes you deem it an inescapable nightmare. I suppose I’ve learned being subject to love also usually means subject to hatred. Yet, when you truly, truly love someone, that love never goes away. Despite hatred, time, distance, growth, change. You keep a part of yourself, a part from in that time, with that person. You hold it with you forever, as if you were holding a piece of them. 

If you love someone hard enough, you end up having to convince yourself that you do not. The reality is, you do still now, and you will forever. It’s a beautiful thing to share yourself with someone, as you are intertwined in a way that can not be undone or forgotten. A memory only, but an ever present one, of such love.

I have to admit I slept in the afternoon and drank a cup of coffee at around 5-6 pm I'm never doing it again however I've done it before and it didn't affect me like this. The only difference was that I was stressed, i cried before going to bed. So when I was finally able to get some sleep I wasn't in a deep sleep just a shallow sleep where I'd have dreams I don't really remember but then I would partially wake up, my mind awake but couldn't move. This has happened to me a lot before when in REM sleep and i would relax myself a bit and then wake up normally. But this night, everytime I tried to sleep again it happened and I got so annoyed and tired waking myself like that multiple times. So this time, it just came to me that I'm possibly on the verge of having an OBE so I lifted my hands out to check. It was so dark i couldn't see much but managed to see a very faint translucent hand. I had an OBE before this and it was so vivid in which my vision was clear and I saw my body as a white translucent slightly misty figure but it was broad daylight then, also this time my vision was distorted and foggy. So, then I lifted my other hand and tried to move it through my blanket but couldn't so I had to drag it and pull out which wasn't the case in my other OBEs, I was very restricted in this one. Then I got the sudden tingling in my lower body and wanted to masturbate but I was able to tell myself that I'd do it at a later time. I tried to sit up and surprisingly I was able to alright I guess but then the weirdest thing happened. Everything was a blur but I remember shaking a dry crusty hand to my left without much control and then i just lowkey remembered i shouldn't do that in here i panicked a bit and then all I remember is some hand reaching for my thighs and me getting panicky. I immediately fell back and relaxed myself and tried Monroe's technique to wake myself up. I was awake. 
Final take: I know I've been having a lot of lucid dreams in which I'd successfully projected and floated in the entire house but I believe this was an actual one because in the entire experience I was having heavy vibrations and when I woke up it was still around for a few minutes. My best guess is I was stressed which resulted in such an uncanny experience.

Between the morning rush, lunchtime crowds, and the steady flow of regulars, there’s no room for slow systems or clunky technology. In 2026, a modern POS system isn’t just helpful; it’s essential. The right setup can speed up service, reduce mistakes, and give you full control over your operations.

If you’re looking for the top POS system for your café, here are the must-have features every coffee shop needs:

**1. Fast and User-Friendly Interface**  
Speed is everything in a busy café. A top POS system should have a clean, intuitive layout that allows staff to take orders quickly without complicated steps. Customizable buttons, easy modifiers (like milk options or extra shots), and a responsive touchscreen reduce delays and keep lines moving. When your team feels confident using the system, service becomes smoother and more efficient.

**2. Flexible Payment Processing**  
London customers expect convenience. Your POS should support:

* Contactless payments
* Mobile wallets
* Card payments
* Split bills
* Online and in-store transactions

The easier you make it to pay, the better the customer experience. Quick, reliable transactions also reduce queues during peak hours.

**3. Real-Time Inventory Management**  
Inventory issues can quietly eat into profits. A strong POS system tracks stock automatically as items are sold. You’ll know when you’re running low on popular ingredients and can plan orders accordingly. This not only reduces waste but also prevents awkward “sorry, we’re out of that” moments.

**4. Detailed Reporting and Analytics**  
Data helps you grow smarter, not harder. The best systems provide clear reports on daily sales, best-selling drinks, peak times, and staff performance. With this information, you can adjust menus, optimize pricing, and schedule staff more effectively.

**5. Staff Management Tools**  
Managing a café team can be challenging. A modern POS allows you to track shifts, set user permissions, and monitor sales by employee. This improves accountability and keeps operations organized.

**6. Cloud-Based Access and Scalability**  
In 2026, flexibility matters. Cloud-based POS systems let you check your business performance from anywhere. If you’re planning to open another location, scalability becomes a huge advantage.

**best restaurant point of sale system** solutions bring all these features together into one seamless platform. They connect front-of-house and back-of-house operations, minimize errors, and provide valuable business insights. When everything works in sync, your café runs like a well-tuned machine.

Choosing the right POS system isn’t just about processing payments — it’s about building a foundation for growth. With the right features in place, your London café can operate faster, smarter, and more profitably in 2026 and beyond.",1,1771506571.0,TheSpreadContent,0,1.0,False

1r8yqxa,https://www.reddit.com/r/PrivacyCompass/comments/1r8yqxa/how_to_watch_viu_in_the_usa/,How to Watch Viu in the USA,"You open the Viu app on your phone, you tap on *Taxi Driver 3*, and then—

**""This content is not available in your region.""**

Fantastic. Another geo-block. Another streaming platform deciding you don't deserve good TV because of your zip code.

Here's the thing though: Viu is genuinely worth the hassle. As of mid-2025, it crossed **13.8 million premium subscribers** globally and holds a staggering K-drama catalog that rivals Netflix—Running Man, Korean variety shows, Thai BL series, simulcast dramas fresh off Korean broadcast the same night. But the USA isn't one of Viu's 16+ official markets. Not even close.

So you need a VPN. Full stop. No creative workaround, no browser trick. Just a VPN.

# Wait—Viu or ViuTV? (You Need to Know This First)

Most guides lump these together. They shouldn't. They're two completely different things, and picking the wrong one will have you staring at Cantonese news instead of K-dramas.

|Platform|What It Is|Content|Restriction|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Viu**|Subscription/free OTT streaming|K-dramas, Korean variety, Thai, Indonesian, Arabic content|Geo-blocked outside 16 markets|
|**ViuTV**|Free-to-air Hong Kong TV channel|Cantonese dramas, local news, HK variety|**Only available in Hong Kong**|

Both run under PCCW Media Group. Both are geo-blocked for US viewers. But if you want *Running Man* and *Taxi Driver 3*, you want **Viu** — and you'll need a server in a supported region like Hong Kong or Singapore. If you specifically want Cantonese HK programming, that's ViuTV, and Hong Kong is your *only* VPN destination.

# How to Watch Viu in the USA: Step-by-Step

This takes about 5 minutes once you've picked your VPN.

1. **Subscribe to a VPN** — Pick one from the table below. Don't use a free VPN. (More on why in a moment.)
2. **Download the VPN app** on your device — Windows, Mac, Android, iOS, Fire Stick, whatever you're using.
3. **Connect to a Hong Kong or Singapore server** — For Viu, Hong Kong and Singapore both work. For ViuTV specifically, it must be Hong Kong.
4. **Open the Viu website or app** — `viu.com` or download the Viu app on mobile.
5. **Create an account or log in** — Sign up with your email, no special tricks needed.
6. **Start streaming** — If it still shows a region error, clear your browser cache and cookies, then reload.

>**Pro tip:** Use the Viu website in your browser rather than the app if you're hitting connection issues. The browser version plays nicer with VPN connections and is easier to troubleshoot.

# Best VPNs to Watch Viu in the USA (2025-2026)

Not every VPN actually works. Viu detects and blocks known VPN IP ranges—something free services get hit with constantly, and even some paid providers struggle with. These are the ones that hold up:

|VPN|HK Servers|Speed|Simultaneous Devices|Money-Back Guarantee|Best For|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**ExpressVPN**|✅ Multiple|⚡ Fastest|8|30 days|Overall reliability|
|**NordVPN**|✅ 70+|⚡ Very fast|10|30 days|Server variety|
|**Surfshark**|✅ 50+|✅ Fast|Unlimited|30 days|Budget / multiple devices|
|**CyberGhost**|✅ Yes|✅ Good|7|45 days|Beginners|
|**IPVanish**|✅ Multiple|✅ Good|Unlimited|30 days|Alternative pick|

**My honest take on these:**

*ExpressVPN* is the most consistently reliable for streaming—I've seen it hold up when others get blocked mid-session. The `Lightway` protocol it uses is genuinely quick, and the `MediaStreamer` feature (essentially a Smart DNS built into the subscription) lets you unblock Viu on smart TVs that don't support VPN apps natively. Worth the premium price if streaming is your main goal.

*NordVPN* is the value king here. Seventy-plus servers in Hong Kong means you're never stuck fighting for bandwidth, and their `Threat Protection Pro` feature blocks ads and trackers while you stream. For most people, this is the sweet spot between price and performance.

*Surfshark* has unlimited device connections, which matters if you want to run Viu on your TV, phone, and laptop simultaneously without juggling accounts. Speeds are solid but more variable than ExpressVPN—sometimes brilliant, occasionally frustrating.

# Why Free VPNs Won't Work (And Might Actually Hurt You)

Look, I get the appeal. But free VPNs are a genuinely bad idea for Viu specifically, and here's why it's not just marketing talk from paid VPN providers.

Free services run shared IP pools that streaming platforms have *already catalogued and blocked*. The moment you connect to a free VPN's Hong Kong server, Viu's detection system flags it before you've even clicked play. These IP ranges get blacklisted fast because thousands of users pile onto the same handful of servers.

And the security angle is worse. Several free VPNs have been caught logging and selling user browsing data—the *exact opposite* of what a VPN is supposed to do. Some inject ads directly into your browser session.

>**The math here is simple:** A premium VPN costs roughly $3-5/month on annual plans. That's one cup of overpriced coffee. The 30-day money-back guarantees on every provider above mean you can test it completely risk-free.

# Which Devices Can You Watch Viu On?

Viu has apps for basically everything. The VPN situation varies a bit by device type, so here's a quick breakdown:

|Device|VPN Method|Notes|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**iPhone / iPad**|Native VPN app|Straightforward—install VPN, connect, open Viu app|
|**Android phone/tablet**|Native VPN app|Same as iOS, slightly easier to sideload if needed|
|**Windows / Mac**|Desktop VPN app|Most reliable—browser streaming works great|
|**Apple TV**|`MediaStreamer` (Smart DNS)|ExpressVPN's built-in feature handles this|
|**Android TV / Fire Stick**|VPN app or router|Most VPNs have Fire Stick apps directly|
|**Smart TV (non-Android)**|Router-level VPN|Set up VPN on your router to cover all home devices|
|**Chromecast**|Router-level VPN|Cast from a VPN-connected device or use router setup|

The router setup sounds intimidating but it's genuinely a one-time thing. Once your router connects through a Hong Kong VPN server, every device on your home network gets the geo-unblock automatically—including your smart TV, gaming console, anything.

# What You Can Actually Watch on Viu

This is the part that makes the whole setup worth it. Viu's catalog hits different from what you'd find on Netflix, particularly for K-drama and Korean variety superfans.

**Current big titles (as of early 2026):**

* *Taxi Driver 3* — The third season of the beloved revenge-thriller franchise
* *Running Man (2025)* — Week 780+ and still going strong
* *I DOL I* and *Love Me* — Fresh Korean dramas
* *2 Days 1 Night* — The original outdoor variety chaos
* *Street Woman Fighter 3* — The global dance competition edition
* *Viu Originals* — Southeast Asian productions including Thai, Philippine, and Malaysian series

Viu also simulcasts Korean dramas essentially the same night they air in Korea, which is a big deal if you're tired of waiting for Netflix to license content months later. That near-real-time access is one of the genuine advantages over other platforms.

# Troubleshooting: When Viu Still Blocks You

Sometimes you do everything right and it still doesn't work. Here's what actually fixes it:

**Clear browser cache and cookies** first — old session data can expose your real location even with a VPN running. This solves maybe 60% of issues immediately.

**Try a different Hong Kong server** — If your VPN has 70 servers in HK, they don't all have equal reliability. Switch to a different one.

**Switch protocols** — In your VPN settings, try `WireGuard` if you're on `OpenVPN`, or vice versa. Some networks block specific protocols at the ISP level.

**Check for DNS and WebRTC leaks** — Go to `dnsleaktest.com` with your VPN connected. If it shows your real US location, your VPN isn't routing properly. A good premium VPN should show Hong Kong.

**Use the browser, not the app** — The Viu web player at `viu.com` tends to respond better to VPN connections than the mobile app, which sometimes has built-in location detection beyond just your IP.

# Frequently Asked Questions

**Is Viu free?** Viu has a free tier with ads and limited content, plus a premium subscription that removes ads and unlocks the full catalog. Pricing depends on your region—since you're accessing via VPN, account registration works through the standard signup flow.

**Is using a VPN to watch Viu legal?** VPNs are legal in the US. Using one to access geo-restricted content violates Viu's Terms of Service (as it does with basically every streaming platform), but this is a ToS issue, not a legal one. The realistic consequence is getting your account flagged—not anything more serious.

**Will a VPN slow down my Viu streaming?** Some speed reduction is normal. With a quality VPN and a nearby server, the impact on 1080p streaming is minimal. The VPNs in the table above consistently maintained solid speeds in testing for HD streaming without buffering.

**Do I need a Hong Kong IP specifically?** For ViuTV (the Cantonese channel), yes—Hong Kong only. For the Viu streaming service, Hong Kong and Singapore both work. Singapore servers sometimes deliver better speeds from the US West Coast.

>**Quick Summary:** Viu isn't available in the USA officially. A VPN with Hong Kong or Singapore servers bypasses the geo-block in minutes. ExpressVPN and NordVPN are the most reliable picks for consistent streaming. Free VPNs will get blocked. The browser version of Viu works better than the app when troubleshooting.

1r8ypu9,https://i.redd.it/sbb9in00agkg1.jpeg,Homemade Polish Sauerkraut and Mushroom Pierogi – Family Favorite,"I made pierogi from scratch last night and honestly wasn't sure if I'd have the patience for it, but these Polish Sauerkraut and Mushroom Pierogi turned out way better than I expected. My grandmother used to make them for Christmas Eve but I never got her exact recipe, so I've been winging it based on what I remember. This time I actually followed a proper method and the filling tasted just like hers. I wrote down what I did here if anyone's interested: [https://www.amgroyal.com/polish-sauerkraut-mushroom-pierogi](https://www.amgroyal.com/polish-sauerkraut-mushroom-pierogi)  
  
Here's what I used:  
  
For the Dough:  
4 cups all-purpose flour  
1 tsp fine salt  
1 1/2 cups very hot water  
2 tbsp unsalted butter  
  
For the Sauerkraut & Mushroom Filling:  
3/4–1 lb sauerkraut, drained and chopped  
2 oz dried wild mushrooms (porcini or boletes)  
2 medium onions, finely chopped  
6 tbsp oil (or 4 tbsp oil + 2 tbsp butter)  
2–3 bay leaves  
4 allspice berries  
1 tsp sugar  
1/2 tsp black pepper  
Salt, to taste  
1–1 1/2 cups water total (including mushroom soaking liquid)  
  
Here's how I made it:  
  
1. I soaked the dried mushrooms overnight in cold water after rinsing them twice to get rid of any grit. This step matters because you use that soaking liquid later and it adds so much flavor.  
  
2. I drained and chopped the sauerkraut, tasted it first to check if it was too sour, then squeezed out the extra liquid.  
  
3. Strained the mushroom soaking liquid through a coffee filter, chopped the softened mushrooms, and set everything aside.  
  
4. Put the sauerkraut in a pot with bay leaves, allspice, sugar, pepper, salt, and about a cup of the mushroom liquid mixed with water. Covered and simmered for about an hour until it was really soft.  
  
5. While that cooked, I sauteed the onions in oil until they were golden, added the chopped mushrooms, and cooked everything together for another few minutes.  
  
6. Mixed the onion-mushroom mixture into the sauerkraut pot and let it cook uncovered for 15 to 20 minutes so the extra liquid could evaporate. Removed the bay leaves and allspice, then let it cool completely.  
  
7. Made the dough by mixing flour and salt, then pouring in very hot water with melted butter. Kneaded it for about 5 minutes, covered, and let it rest for 30 minutes.  
  
8. Rolled the dough super thin, cut circles about 3 inches wide, and dusted them with flour.  
  
9. Put a teaspoon of filling in each circle, folded them into half-moons, and pinched the edges tight to seal.  
  
10. Boiled them in batches until they floated, then cooked for another 3 to 4 minutes. I drained them and tossed with a little oil, then pan-fried a bunch in butter because that's how my family always ate them.  
  
A few things I noticed: Don't rush the filling because the longer it cooks down, the better it gets. I almost added too much liquid at first and had to let it simmer longer. Also, the hot water dough method actually works really well and makes the dough way easier to work with than I thought it would be. I froze about half of the uncooked ones on a floured tray and they should be perfect for a quick dinner later. And honestly, the fried onions on top are a must if you're serving these to anyone.

My job is basically 80% calls. Zoom, Teams, random “quick syncs” that are never quick. For months I was using laptop speakers like a clown. Bad echo, “can you repeat that?”, coworkers sounding like they’re underwater. And it's not that my speakers are bad but network coverage can indeed be disguised as principalities and powers. Not to mention holding my phone to my ear during longer calls like it’s 2007.

I kept telling myself it wasn’t a big deal. I am surviving through this. 

I came into some extra cash and I decided I had had enough. I quickly went looking for a reliable headpiece on Alibaba, no game RGB nonsense. Just functional and lightweight.

Oh boyyyy! Did that change my life? Yes it fucking did. 

Calls are clearer. My hands are free. I can type notes, sip coffee, even stretch without balancing a phone on my shoulder like a maniac.

But the biggest difference is mental. I stopped shouting and asking for repetition like a lunatic.

Good Point- Dr Nilima is very kind to explain and take care of

Bad Point- this is a bad night, my previous surgery did not have colon preparation. 

My operation day on 17/02/2026, based on suggestion of members here in the group, and private DM, I request my operation to be on priority. I was given slot no.2, 

Good point- my operation took 55 mins, I got video, my mother is allowed to stand in the OT, they also do video call to my father in Abu Dhabi from OT, it’s a great experience for my mother. She was also asked for coffee in the OT, I am told she loved the coffee. Dr Jay Mehta took personal care of my mother. 

After Operation, I am back in room, and I am get awake after 5 hours properly. 

Good Point- it’s super clean, Alhamdullilah. All the time office staff is cleaning the room every 3 hours

Good point- they give me pen drive on discharge for video of surgery which is unedited 

Bad point- I am expecting photos also, but this is a bit of an overkill I think 

Overall experience of India people- very good

Then last year I hit the classic burnout wall: six months bouncing between hotels, working from lounges where the chairs suck and the lighting is terrible, and spending half my screen time on buffering circles instead of writing. So I decided to experiment: what if I just worked outside?  
  
I got myself a basic Forenia camping outdoor setup tent, lightweight chair, compact table, from an online supplier I found while browsing for travel gear (Alibaba had a few inexpensive bundles, so I grabbed one with the rest of my trip gear). I didn't expect it to change much. But I enjoyed it way too much.  
  
I set it up close to this lake that I have come to know like the back of my hand and my oh my, the peace of the serene. And each time I was done with a meeting or taking instructions for the next project, it was always easier going for a walk on the beach and practicing photography other than doomscrolling.

I (34M) recently moved to Boston and my coworker / friend mentioned that his elder sister lives there. He said that she’d be happy to meet me for a coffee and show me around and he gave me her number (he said he’d given her a heads up).

I reached out to her and didn’t hear back for about a month until last week when she replied that she missed my message and offered to meetup for coffee / drinks. Apparently, her brother asked her (on his own - I didn’t tell him) if she met me and that was the trigger. She also looked me up on LinkedIn.

We met last weekend for coffee and instantly hit it off - we had lots of mutual interests, we spoke for about 3 hours (about work / family / interests), and made plans to meet up again (she came up with ideas).

We have been texting regularly since then and I asked her if she wants to meet up again at a bookstore (one of her ideas) and then go to a restaurant later and she instantly agreed.

I feel there’s potential in this connection, but I am not sure if I am approaching this correctly. I generally use dating apps to meet women, but this is the first time I met someone through a friend. When we met, she didn’t mention if she had a partner and I didn’t explicitly ask her.

Is it fair to think she’s potentially interested in me as a dating option? Should I approach our next meetup as a date? I didn’t ask my coworker/friend if she was single (although he knows that I am). Any advice on how to navigate this will be helpful. Thank you! 🙏",1,1771505503.0,dating_advice,4,0.67,False

When organizing a coastal getaway, many travelers begin by searching [**what to do on south padre**](https://www.spadre.com/activities.htm) to map out their itinerary. South Padre Island offers a mix of relaxation, adventure, and family-friendly attractions that make planning both exciting and simple. From sandy beaches to outdoor excursions, knowing your priorities helps shape the perfect schedule. A well-planned trip ensures you experience the best the island has to offer without feeling rushed.

**Choose the Best Time to Visit**

Timing plays a major role in creating a smooth vacation. Spring and summer bring warm Gulf waters and lively energy, while fall offers fewer crowds and pleasant temperatures. Winter months can be quieter and ideal for those seeking a peaceful escape. Checking seasonal weather patterns and local events helps you select dates that match your travel style. Planning around peak seasons also helps with availability and budgeting.

**Book the Right Accommodations**

South Padre Island features a wide range of lodging options, from beachfront condos to family-friendly hotels. Selecting accommodations near your preferred attractions can save travel time and enhance convenience. Oceanfront views, pool access, and kitchen amenities may influence your decision. Early reservations often provide better rates and location choices. The right place to stay sets the tone for your entire trip.

**Plan Beach and Water Activities**

No visit to South Padre Island is complete without spending time on the water. Swimming, paddleboarding, jet skiing, and parasailing are popular options for adventure seekers. Those who prefer relaxation can enjoy sunbathing or long walks along the shoreline. Dolphin watching tours and fishing excursions add memorable experiences to any itinerary. Including water-based activities ensures you fully embrace the island lifestyle.

**Explore Local Attractions and Nature**

Beyond the beaches, South Padre offers unique natural and cultural experiences. Visitors can explore birdwatching areas, marine life exhibits, and scenic walking trails. Nature enthusiasts will appreciate the opportunity to see coastal wildlife in its natural habitat. Educational centers and local museums add variety to your travel schedule. Mixing outdoor fun with learning creates a balanced and engaging vacation.

**Enjoy Dining and Local Flavors**

Planning meals ahead of time can enhance your overall trip experience. South Padre Island is known for fresh Gulf seafood, casual beachfront dining, and vibrant evening spots. Trying a mix of local favorites and new cuisines keeps your trip exciting. Making dinner reservations during peak travel periods is often a smart move. Great food is a key part of any memorable getaway.

**Consider Transportation and Logistics**

While the island is relatively easy to navigate, understanding transportation options can make your stay smoother. Many visitors choose to rent a car for flexibility, especially when exploring nearby areas. Others rely on biking or walking if staying close to main attractions. Factoring in parking, travel times, and local traffic ensures fewer surprises. Organized logistics help you maximize your vacation time.

**Leave Room for Relaxation**

It’s tempting to schedule every hour, but leaving open time allows for spontaneous fun. Watching a Gulf Coast sunset or enjoying a quiet morning coffee by the beach adds simple pleasures to your trip. Balancing adventure with downtime creates a more enjoyable and less stressful experience. Flexibility often leads to unexpected highlights. A relaxed pace helps you truly unwind.

**Conclusion**

Planning the perfect trip to South Padre Island comes down to preparation, timing, and understanding your interests. By researching activities, booking accommodations early, and organizing logistics, you can create a seamless travel experience. Whether you’re visiting for adventure or relaxation, thoughtful planning ensures your getaway meets expectations. With its beautiful coastline and welcoming atmosphere, South Padre Island remains a top destination for travelers across the United States.

1r8yb62,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1r8yb62/we_have_built_an_ai_storytelling_platform_this/,We have built an AI storytelling platform. This week we launched Open Beta.,"I would like your honest feedback. We’ve built a Lucid Book, a new AI-powered interactive storytelling platform.

It started as a simple idea:  
What if you could build your own story world… and actually play it?

Not just chat with a bot.  
Not just generate a short story.  
But create a structured story with characters, locations, relationships and step inside it.

This week finally launched Open Beta.



# What Lucid Book actually is

It’s a hybrid between:

* AI roleplay
* interactive fiction
* worldbuilding tools
* and structured narrative design

You build your book from scratch:

* define the backstory
* create characters
* assign locations
* set relationships
* structure chapters

Then you enter the story through a real-time AI chat interface and experience it as a playable narrative.



# What we’ve learned building it

* People don’t want simple “AI chat” anymore, they want structured experiences.
* Onboarding is everything. We are working on a proper tutorial system.
* Mobile UX will hurt you anytime it can.
* Dark mode bugs will haunt you forever and Safari will fight against any fixes.
* There is never enough coffee.



# Why I’m posting here

We’re not doing proper paid marketing yet.  
We’re trying to grow organically and learn from early users.

If you’re into:

* AI tools
* storytelling
* worldbuilding
* side projects
* testing early products

I’d genuinely love feedback.

What would make something like this compelling enough for you to use long-term?

If you’re curious, I can share the beta link in the comments.

Happy to answer any technical or product questions as well.",2,1771505255.0,SideProject,1,1.0,False

Im from the east coast of the USA. Looking for people from any country. Work is usually pretty slow unless something breaks or needs to be installed. I am willing to share pics if interested in who we are talking to.

I'm into all kinds of different hobbies. I'm really into houseplants and aquarium keeping. I have over 100 different houseplants. I just got a small greenhouse now, too, and want to buold a bigger one. I have a fish tank room that I have 4 tortoises that live there during the winter. I also have one cat and one dog too. I breed and propagate fish/plants, so I'm always down to trade, too.

I've been drinking a lot of tea and coffee lately. Always like new suggestions for both. I'm trying to slowly get into doing more and more homesteading. I've started making my own breads and want to start making different jelly when it's warm enough for my berry bushes to produce. I am about to get a 3d printer and start messing around with that.

I'm into video games, too. I mainly play Overwatch, Marvel Rivals, Valorant, and Ark Suvival Ascended. Love playing Pokemon games and doing some Pokémon card collecting, too. I've been getting into playing more survival games than shooting games lately. I also built my PC to play on a couple of years ago.

1r8yai6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r8yai6,Utterly disappointed in Subko.,"1.  The dry aroma was pretty bad  it smelled like defects.
2. The wet aroma was also disappointing, mostly grassy and underdeveloped.
3. I made an AeroPress it tasted vegetal and hollow. I made a V60  same result. Finally, I cupped it horrible.
4. The beans are roasted evenly, but they are broken and not screened. It seems like they just don’t care.

I have been vocal about Subko being really good for me in the past. I loved their Ratnagiri Project Pearl. This is beyond unexpected from them. It was so bad that even the non-specialty coffee I roasted a week ago tasted better.

Variables :  
Water: 96 ppm (Barista Hustle recipe) at 93°C  
Grinder: Benki 98 mm burr commercial grinder  
Ratio: 1:15 for AeroPress, 1:16 for V60, 11 g to 200 g (SCA standard) for cupping

I would like to know if anyone has had good results with this coffee, and how.

Please keep in mind this post is made with pretty high standards in mind, as we should expect from roasters of this scale.",22,1771505201.0,IndiaCoffee,8,0.92,False
1r8ya25,https://i.redd.it/htar32286gkg1.jpeg,A Way to Connect— or Disconnect?,"Good morning! To me, social media is meant to help us stay connected—to family, to friends, and to the wider world beyond our front porch. But every now and then, it also hands us a rather sobering little snapshot of modern life.

A recent post popped up in my feed promoting a local tavern. The gentleman who shared it declared it his favorite place to hang out and included a photo he’d taken one evening. It looked cozy enough. Warm lighting. Friendly bar. Promising atmosphere.

But there was one small detail I couldn’t help but notice.

Every single person in the photo—save for the hardworking barkeep—was gazing solemnly into a glowing rectangle. Heads bowed. Faces illuminated by blue light. No one chatting. No one laughing. No one even making awkward small talk about the weather. Just a row of modern-day monks in silent devotion to their smartphones.

I found myself thinking, Well… that’s a rather melancholy image for a favorite hangout. If this is nightlife now, it appears to involve less “life” and more “doomscrolling.”

I’ll confess, I don’t go out much anymore beyond errands or catching a cup of coffee or tea and enjoying a good chat with friends. But if an evening on the town now means gathering together to scroll separately, I suspect I’m not missing much.

I remember when going out meant talking, laughing, dancing, and perhaps making questionable fashion choices you’d regret in later years. It meant stories that unfolded in real time. It meant connection. It meant looking at each other and interacting.

Still, I’m choosing optimism. Perhaps it was an off night. Perhaps they were all checking the Super Bowl score. Perhaps they were all on blind dates that simply did not live up to expectations, and they were quietly hoping for a well-timed “emergency” text to facilitate escape. On the other hand, maybe they were posting about what a wonderful time they were having.

Here’s hoping the next snapshot captures a little less screen glow—and a little more human sparkle. Maybe they’ll even look up long enough to discover that the people around them are actually quite interesting!

I hope all is well in your corner of the world! 🌞 ",1,1771505165.0,u_Read_an_ice_age_saga,0,1.0,False

1r8y9v7,https://i.redd.it/1hh0hkyb6gkg1.jpeg,Quintaliza High Proof Reposado,"All I can say is WHOA! This high-proof reposado takes Quintaliza’s signature coffee-barrel aging and turns up the intensity, delivering a bold yet refined sipping experience.

Nose: Roasted agave leads with warm notes of café mocha, vanilla, and toasted oak, backed by hints of cinnamon and dark chocolate.

Palate: Rich cooked agave, caramel, and chocolate are front and center with subtle coffee and citrus flavors to round it out.  The higher proof adds some nice depth.

Finish: Long and warming with lingering cocoa, orange zest, agave, and coffee.

Conclusion: A distinctive, tequila that feels almost dessert-like yet remains true to agave. The high proof amplifies complexity and texture, making it a standout. I'm excited to see what this brand does next. If you haven't had this do yourself a favor and grab a bottle. It's available now @sip_tequila or directly through @quintalizatequila.
