Someday, I'll make real curtains for decoration and light control, but immediately I just need to make privacy screens.

There's a fabric I've seen used for curtains that I don't know the name of. It's a flat woven fabric, completely homogenous, though sometimes with embroidered cutwork at the hem to make it slightly decorative. It's fully opaque in the sense that you can't see shape or color through it, but it lets almost all the brightness of the light through. In other words, even someone with their face pressed against the glass couldn't make out someone standing inside the room but it doesn't darken the room at all. I think the closest other material that has about the same light/visual properties is white tissue paper.

It's ***NOT*** the tulle-like gauze that normal sheer curtains are made of (that stuff is too see-through).

Anyone know what this fabric is called?

1p3bvmi,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1p3bvmi/carrying_the_weight_of_rejection/,Carrying the weight of rejection,"44yo HLM here. Married to 42yo LL4M wife.

I love my wife, and I'm attracted to her. I love to pleasure her, hold her, and give her my full attention when we have time alone together. I regularly offer to give her massages, foot rubs, and try to do little things like making her morning coffee, running her bath, etc. I tell her she is beautiful, smart, and funny. I put a lot of effort in to show her that I care. I learn from my mistakes and try to truly listen an empathize with her point of view when conflict arises. I'm a good husband, and a good father to our children. I'm fit, successful, and in what feels like the prime of my life.

  
Despite all this, I can't help but feel like I'm drowning in an ocean of sadness. I often feel like I'm just putting on a show, and deep down I'm a sad and lonely man who is barely holding it together. I feel like a shell of myself, like a robot who works, takes care of the house and kids, and all of the mundane tasks while she spends her time isolating herself from us. My self confidence is shot. I'm criticized for being too needy, too sensitive, too much to take on with ""8000 other things on her mind"". I'm at the bottom of her priority list. I'm so far down that I don't even crack the 8000 things on her mind. We both work in the same field, we face the same stresses and challenges, we share the same struggles. She is a priority to me, while I seem to be an afterthought. It saddens me deeply and I have been having more persistent thoughts of ending the marriage. The thoughts scare me and I feel such guilt for having them. She is rarely present and doomscrolls whenever she has a moment.  She is quick to criticize me for doing things differently than the way she would have, but never seems to do the things herself. She is armchair quarterbacking from the sidelines and bringing little to the table herself. It's gotten to the point that I'm getting dirty looks or offhanded remarks  for breathing ""too loudly"" and has said things like ""my skin is reacting to you and it burns"" when I try to touch her. 

My wife is still sexual. She binges smut novels and uses pornography. She watches very sexually charged tv shows and reality shows. She just doesn't feel that way about ME. Our lack of a healthy sex life is so much more difficult for me than it is for her. It's been a point of contention in our relationship for many years. I used to use porn to drown out my feelings and fill the void. I gave it up entirely for several months and told her about it. I told her that I wanted to save my sexual energy for her. That I feel so much closer and fulfilled sharing my sexuality with her, and her alone. She encouraged me and said she would like to do the same. We had sex once during those three months, and it really felt like a mercy fuck. She wasn't engaged or present. She actually said ""I'll let you get some tonight"" a few days prior to the unfulfilling sex. When I think about it, most of her promises to be intimate don't come to fruition, and they always carry the same ""I'll let you"" kind of vibe. I made many offers to pleasure her and attempts to be intimate during that time and they were met with a host of excuses and ""maybe tomorrows"". I later learned that she was regularly watching threesome porn the entire time and was lying to me. She continued to lie after being presented with the evidence. She had the gall to call me a porn addict for telling her that I thought it was part of the problem in our love life and taking action to correct it. She lied about her habits and called me an addict while rejecting all of my advances. It stung deep. Here I was having wet dreams as a grown man and she was rejecting all of my advances and making excuses so that she could go get herself off minutes later.

The thing is... I don't want her to let me do anything. I don't want obligatory sexual relations. I don't want her to roll over and let me penetrate her. I don't want mercy handjobs because she has shut down all of my attempts and feels guilty about it. What I want more than anything is to feel seen, to feel desired, and to be WANTED again. I want a willing and engaged partner to share my love with, not a hole to plow. I resorted to using porn again when the feelings of unfulfilled sexual energy started to keep me awake at night or distract me from being a productive person. I don't like that I was doing it, and have been free from porn for about a week now. I've decided to stop using it entirely, but masturbation to fantasy or focusing on the pleasurable sensations is still on the table. I AM a sexual being and I won't deny myself one of the gifts this life has to offer. I just really wish that I had someone to share it with. 

  
I don't know what the future holds, but I'm slowly realizing that I can't continue living this way. I used to feel alive. I used to look forward to time alone with my wife. Now it carries this unseen weight of rejection and sadness. II just needed someone to share it with. Thanks for letting me vent. It feels therapeutic to get this off of my chest.

I got diagnosed with MCAS last year but I think I have had aspects of it since I was a child. I can remember being itchy when it was cold outside while camping. 

I was eating unaged frozen beef, eggs, mold free coffee, onions, cream, and nothing else. Then I got cocky and started eating cheese and pork rinds. 

Coworkers kept coming to work sick, I was stressed I guess, and probably high histamine.

I had not been feeling right for a few days, kept getting this weird pulse through my body. 

My body would pulse and it felt like my blood pressure would drop. I would  nearly pass out, and then my heart would kick back in beating out of control. 

I work outdoors remotely and I was just trying to make it through the night to get home. I took a sip of cold water that set off a three day anaphilactic episode that needed prednisone to stop. 

Ambulance was over an hour away so a random guy on coke drove me to the nearest hospital. I didn't use my epi pen like an idiot. I thought it ""wasn't that bad.""

Prednisone made me absolutely sick and left long term side affects. 

I can now only tolerate beef and eggs in super small quantities or not eat at all. Fasting I feel best, but I am already thin. 

I just started Xoliar. I take ketotifen, areus, Famotidine. I pay A LOT of money to see a specialist. It just doesn't seem to be working out for me. 

This disease is whack. What now? I've been off for three months already. I can't stay inside forever. Thoughts, prayers, opinions 🙏

1p3bt01,https://www.reddit.com/r/MushroomCoffee/comments/1p3bt01/ryze_review/,Ryze Review,"I only had 2 cups, so not much to go on, but overall- not bad.

It's definitely more mild than regular coffee. I've had cocoa powder from trader Joe's for decades that I hardly use and is too rich to use by itself. I added it to the coffee to make mocha- my favorite. Maybe I'll add a bit of peppermint somehow as that's really my ideal.

I think I'd like it best ice blended like a frapp with chocochips. My mom has good coffee for the machine- mcdonalds and Colombian coffee. The Colombian coffee is rich and delicious but the buzz is too strong and leaves me restless. Plus cleanup is annoying.

Anyway Ryze is more mild like starbucks. I take half the serving powder mixed with half of trader Joe's cocoa powder. It's still strong and I think I like half of a cup of coffee. 

Today I got my period. I get stress cramps sometimes and bathroom issues and bloating. I had the coffee in the morning, no issue. Then a few hours later-stress cramps. I took Advil which never works but it's better than nothing. I frantically ate sour cream to make it stop. No luck.

On a whim, I made the mushroom cocoa blend. Weirdly instantly my cramps stopped and I became soothed and lethargic. I couldn't finish the cup and I just wanted to sleep. I don't typically get tired from cocoa or coffee, let alone lethargic. In any case, I'm very sensitive to food. Caesars pizza sends me to the bathroom for hours immediately without fail. I find Ryze is oddly soothing and a cramp stopper.

1p3bs39,https://newrepublic.com/article/203481/trump-polls-stock-market-economy,"💥 Is the Market Crash Trump's Political Reckoning?: The AI Bubble Bursts, Dragging Markets Down","November 2025 is shaping up to be a brutal month for Wall Street, with the stock market recording its poorest performance since the catastrophic 2008 financial crisis. Despite a temporary uptick fueled by an unexpected September jobs report and a stellar third-quarter earnings announcement from AI chip giant Nvidia, the market’s downward spiral quickly resumed. The core issue is inescapable: the AI bubble, an unprecedented speculative surge, is actively deflating.

While Nvidia remains an economic behemoth—a $5 trillion entity representing nearly 20% of the entire U.S. economy—its actual contribution to employment is negligible, accounting for less than 0.01% of the workforce. This illustrates the fragility of a market propped up by a vanishingly small number of highly valued tech stocks and a tottering private equity sector. The signs point unequivocally toward a deeper financial correction, with a bear market and a probable recession on the horizon.

Simultaneously, Trump’s political standing is deteriorating rapidly. His approval rating, which has been in decline since his second inauguration, plummeted over the last month, hitting a low of 38 percent according to Reuters. This is mirrored by deep public pessimism on economic issues; a recent Marquette poll revealed a startling 28-to-72 percent deficit for Trump on the issue of inflation. Even traditionally friendly outlets like Fox News have registered the sharp drop in his favorability.

Trump’s political liabilities are mounting: the shadow of the Jeffrey Epstein scandal, his persistent refusal to extend popular Obamacare subsidies, a looming Supreme Court challenge over tariffs that could cost the Treasury an estimated $300 billion, and potential new revelations concerning the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. While some strategists, like Karl Rove, have pointed to token political moves—such as allowing the release of the Epstein files or removing tariffs on non-domestic items like coffee and bananas—these appear to be little more than expedient retrenchments rather than genuine policy shifts.

Do these two negative metrics—a falling stock market and a shrinking presidential mandate—measure a single phenomenon? The answer is nuanced, but the trajectories are converging.

On one level, the correlation is intuitive: as American consumers and investors become pessimistic about the economy, the current administration inevitably takes the blame, leading to a dip in Trump’s popularity. Indeed, Fox News data suggests voters now rate Trump's handling of the economy slightly worse than they did President Joe Biden’s at the close of his term.

However, the declines were not initially synchronized. Trump’s polling downturn began in January, while the S&P 500, with minor volatility, continued climbing through October. This suggests that the underlying structural financial problems—from the burgeoning AI bubble to issues within the financial sector—were evident well before Inauguration Day.

The economic stumble under the current administration is undeniable. Inflation spiked following the announcement of ""Liberation Day"" tariffs, and job creation stalled dramatically mid-year. Consumer spending remains high, but this is a deeply deceptive indicator; a grotesque analysis shows that the top 10 percent of income earners now account for nearly half of all consumer spending. The U.S. economy currently resembles a Jenga tower, balanced precariously on fewer and fewer blocks: a handful of wealthy consumers and a small roster of massive tech companies. When the coming bear market inevitably impacts the wealthy, this tower will surely crash.

The earliest warning sign of this decline has been the crypto market. Bitcoin's gains for the past year have been entirely wiped out. Economist Paul Krugman suggests that crypto assets function as a ""Trump trade""—a speculative, politically-fueled investment with limited genuine utility, dependent on Trump's promotion of the industry. With Trump’s political power rapidly diminishing, Krugman argues, the crypto market is starting to look like ""money down the drain."" A similar collapse may soon follow in the data center construction industry, also linked to parallel instances of corruption.

Furthermore, Krugman notes that voters are starting to reject the political narratives surrounding the economy. While the previous administration was perhaps too honest about economic realities, Trump’s persistent insistence that “grocery prices are way down”—a demonstrably false claim—is beginning to cost him credibility. Americans are “paying a price for not believing their own eyes” and are now judging the economy less through a partisan lens.

Until now, the stock market’s decline and Trump’s political devaluation have been parallel, but separate, events. Looking forward, however, all signs suggest they are about to become inextricably linked, following the same downward trajectory. The cold comfort is that we are finally witnessing the overdue political devaluation of Trump. The tough reality is that this political reckoning will directly translate into a painful reduction in the value of every American's 401(k).",1,1763762599.0,politics_NOW,0,1.0,False

According to their website?

**🤷 “We’d rather not say.”**

They used:

* Fake executives
* Fake bios
* Fake credentials
* Fake Crypto.com team photos (no… seriously)
* Fake FinCEN registration
* Fake “SaxAI Financial Technology LLC”

But here’s what they hope you **don’t** know:

✔ **FinCEN is not a financial regulator**  
✔ **A Colorado LLC can be made by anyone in 10 minutes online**  
✔ **Shell companies are the MLM scammer’s deodorant — they don’t fix the smell**

And in the source code?  
**Chinese-language markers found in dozens of identical “click-a-button” Ponzi apps** tied to scam compounds operating in:

* Cambodia
* Myanmar
* Laos
* Nigeria
* Brazil

So who runs SaxAI?  
**Probably the same guys running 50 other fake mining apps… from behind a locked gate guarded by someone with an AK-47.**

Because honestly, I’ve always found myself falling into the classic trap of the “little purchases.” You know the one: *It’s just a coffee, what could possibly go wrong?* And yeah, in the moment it feels harmless. But then the end of the month rolls around and suddenly that “just a coffee” has quietly turned into a solid 100 dollars. Money that could’ve gone into something actually meaningful or helpful for my future. And don’t get me wrong—I’m not mad at coffee. I love coffee. That’s not the point. The real issue is how easily we spend on stuff that, if we’re being honest, doesn’t really matter. Useless things bought with money we literally trade hours of our lives for. When you look at it that way, it kind of hits differently. So… I decided to build this simple, maybe even stupid little app that shows you *how much of your time* your money is actually worth. The idea is: if you see purchases in terms of hours of your life instead of dollars, maybe it becomes easier to make smarter decisions and avoid those sneaky “little expenses” that pile up.

I’m looking for some perspective on my old PC and whether it’s worth upgrading specific components or building a new PC from scratch. my cousin and I built this PC in mid‑2018  and I’ve mostly used it for watching YouTube and playing games. Lately, I’ve been thinking about upgrading or replacing it, but I’m not entirely sure which components are the bottleneck, or if it’s all of them.

Here are the specs:

**CPU:** Intel Core i3‑8100 @ 3.60 GHz (Coffee Lake, 4 cores / 4 threads)

**RAM:** 16 GB DDR4 Dual Channel @ 1066 MHz

**GPU:** NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti 4GB (MSI)

**Storage:** 500GB SSD WD sata the m2 size stick one but says sata

**Motherboard:** MSI Z370‑A PRO

**OS:** Win10 64‑bit

how I normally use my pc is mostly watching YouTube and streaming video

Gaming: mainly Minecraft Modpacks (lightly and heavily modded) and indie roguelite/roguelike titles like PlateUp, MegaBonk, Brotato, etc.

I’m not doing heavy video editing or other productivity-heavy tasks

**Questions I have** 

In 2025, how would you rate this PC in terms of performance and gaming capability? (Budget, entry-level, mid-range, etc.)

If I wanted to upgrade to improve my gaming experience, which components would give the **best long-term value**?

Are there any components worth investing in now to avoid upgrading again for 4–5 years?

I want to make a long-term decision on GPU VRAM  would it make sense to invest in a 12GB or 16GB card now, or is 8GB enough for my use case?

I’d really appreciate any advice or guidance on which upgrades would make sense for my use case.

Thanks in advance!",1,1763762521.0,buildapc,1,1.0,False

1p3blx3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1p3blx3/aio_for_questioning_everythingafter_my_best/,AIO for questioning everything…After my best friend became my unsolicited dating coach,"

Okay Reddit, I genuinely don’t know if I’m overthinking or if my intuition is screaming at me. Here’s the full story.

Sophie (24F) and I (24F) have been friends for almost 10 years. Real friends,sleepovers, trauma dumps, “you won’t believe what just happened” kind of friends. We’ve always been close, but not clingy. Healthy, normal close.

This year, we landed internships at the same place, which was exciting. 
We even had a running joke through college:  Rule #1: Never fall for someone older during an internship. Instant emotional death. 
Our golden rule… until I broke it.

 Paul (30M) older, calm, respectful, charming. A green flag(or so did I thought)Dangerous combination. I caught feelings.

Sophie knew him before, just friendly vibes. So when I told her I liked him, I politely asked, “Are you okay with this?” She was like, “Are you kidding? I’m rooting for you. This is exciting.” Cool. Great. In theory.

In practice… Sophie became my personal hype-team/wingwoman/unpaid PR agent against my will. 
I’m an introvert. The kind who needs three days of emotional recovery after calling to make a dentist appointment. 
Meanwhile, Sophie would literally walk up to Paul while I’m standing RIGHT THERE and go: “Sooo Paul, do you have a crush on anyone? 👀 What’s your type?” 
I wanted the ground to open and swallow me whole. Every. Single. Time.

The most humiliating moment? One day she said, “OMG, I need coffee so bad. Can you grab me one pleaaaase?” 
I go, buy the coffee, head back… 
and see her sitting with Paul, leaning in like Oprah hosting a confessional, saying, “No but really, tell me EXACTLY who you like. What do you think of (my name)? Be honest.” 
And I’m walking toward them holding her coffee like a side character in my own story. I died internally.

To be fair, I don’t think Sophie meant malice she genuinely thought she was helping, like some chaotic fairy godmother. 
But it was humiliating. I told her gently multiple times that I hated it. She kept saying, “Nooo, you’re overthinking! I’m helping!”

Anyway, despite the chaos, Paul and I did go on real dates. Multiple. Things went well at first, until I noticed some personality differences. 
Around this time, Sophie’s behavior toward me shifted. She suddenly called multiple times a day, spammed me every few hours, checked in constantly, acted like she needed to know everything. It wasn’t our dynamic. It felt… off.

One example of many , after my first actual date with Paul (it was a dinner date ) she called and said, “I’m coming over.” So I had to cut the date short, go home, open the door, and she stayed over insisting she needed all the details. I’m not the oversharing type. Sometimes I just want to keep things to myself. But she was relentless.

After a few weeks of dating, she invited me to a “serious coffee talk.” 
She went straight into: “He’s not good for you. Something feels wrong. You need to delete him.” 
I first thanked her for gathering the courage to say something, then asked why. She refused to explain. 
Just: “Trust me. I can’t tell you. Just end it.” How does that even make sense? How can someone warn you about someone but refuse to say why?

Here’s the part that really broke me: She told me she had talked to him and said, 
He do like you, BUT he won’t date you seriously. He doesn’t see a future with you. You two are too different.” 
Why would he have that conversation with her instead of me? At first, I thought maybe she discovered something he was hiding, something not aligned with my values. But no they were talking about my relationship without me. She was the third person sitting between us, delivering closure I should’ve had directly from him. Why would he do that? Why would she accept it instead of telling me upfront?

After telling me all that, she said, “You really dodged a bullet. You should go pray in a church. Do donations. You must have done something good in a past life to be saved like this.”

I ended things with Paul right after this conversation (deleted him from all my socials). Mostly because of her talk when my close friend tells me someone is bad for me, I tend to believe them. But also, why would he talk about us with her instead of me? Why was she the one getting closure and not me?

My internship was six months. We started dating around the last two months. Even after deleting him, work was awkward. At first, I didn’t care, but it was strange he didn’t even try to reach out. Honestly, I thought it was for the best. Maybe he just prefers closure through a third party. I didn’t want him anymore.

But then… everything with Sophie started feeling off. She texted constantly, asked for daily pics, asked my location, checked in nonstop. 
At first it felt caring, then invasive. Then she showed me a screenshot of a conversation with him literally just one single message: he said maybe we weren’t meant to be. Not the whole chat, just one line.

And suddenly I find myself thinking things I never wanted to think. How can he not react? Did he have another side? What’s his side of the story? What was said before? Especially that screenshot it’s driving me crazy. Normally, you’d screenshot the whole conversation or let me scroll through it. It’s not that intimate; it’s just between you, talking about me. I understand you don’t want me snooping through your friends, but why not show me the whole page?

I don’t care about Paul anymore, really. But now my brain is obsessing over all of this, and it breaks my heart that I’m thinking this way about my best friend. I never imagined I could.

I normally live in another state and visit home on weekends. 
One weekend, I missed her, so I called. She goes, “Oh, I’m in your state!” …??? 
She knows no one here. At all. Except me. 
I asked why she didn’t tell me. She said she was going to a concert. 
His favorite band. 
A band she has NEVER mentioned liking in the 10 years I’ve known her. 
She traveled to my city, didn’t tell me, spent the last 2 days here, went to HIS favorite band’s concert ,the one he told me non-stop he was excited about before no contact and pretended it was normal.

At this point, I don’t even know what to think.

And now I am just confused. I don’t know if I’m overreacting, or reading too many little signals. I don’t know if I should talk to Sophie, or just wait and see if anything else happens. I really don’t care about Paul anymore, but I do care about my friendship. I could never put a man above it.

At this point I don’t even know what to think",1,1763762194.0,AmIOverreacting,3,1.0,False

I (24M) was recently on holiday in Czech Republic and had a brief, nice interaction with a barista at a small coffee shop. During this time there were a few other people also inside, when we were about to leave, she asked me if she could offer me another cake on the house. Her demeanor was quite shy and sweet with a big smile, which made the gesture feel more personal than just good customer service. I know people in customer service are always nice as part of the job. However we had already paid and were about to go our way so I dont think she needed to be that nice or at least be as shy while asking if she could offer it. I had people also offer me stuff in coffee shops for example when they were about to close and they are never shy about it.
In the moment, I just thanked her and left. My friend pointed out afterwards that she might have been showing interest, and in hindsight, I regret not thanking her properly or even asking if she would feel confortable sharing her contact information.

I'm no longer in that city, but I have the shop's Instagram handle. I'm considering sending them a message, but my main concern is not to make her or the staff uncomfortable.
My proposed message to the shop would be something like this:
""Hello! I visited your wonderful cafe last week and just wanted to say how much I enjoyed it. I was also incredibly touched by the kindness a very sweet brunette barista working on [Day of the week]. She even offered me a cake on the house (probably not to include this part as I don't want to ger hter in trouble). I was in a bit of a hurry and regret not being able to thank her properly or ask for her name. I know this is an unusual request, and please feel free to say no, but I was wondering if it would be possible to ask for her contact information or pass mine on to her, only if she is 100% comfortable with it. If not, could you at least let her know a customer was very grateful for her kindness? She really stood out, since she was the nicest person I met on my whole trip and I believe she deserves to know she is doing an amazing job.""

My question for you is: How would you feel if you were the barista in this situation?
I know each person has its own interpretation but would you find this gesture romantic and determined, or would it feel invasive and ""too much""? I'm genuinely torn between wanting to take a chance because I believe she showed some interest (for being so shy, smilling a lot and not offering to anyone else) in me and prioritizing her comfort above all else.

""I was trying to be heroic."" I held an icepack to my elbow while another was draped over my knee. ""It worked, didn't it""

Melany rolled her eyes, ""I hardly think saving a potted plant was worth you falling down the stairs, especially at your age."" She leaned over, examining me for bruises and cuts. ""You're lucky you didn't break your neck.""

The plant we were referring to sat on the floor at the top of the stairs. It had been on the small round table perched at the back of the narrow landing. And I, having not woken up fully, had bumped into it. The heavy ceramic pot tipped back and forth as the table legs jumped out of my way, and I could see it start to tip toward the stairs; dirt spilled onto the table. I would feel awful if it crashed down the steps, especially since that pot had been in Melany’s family so long, no one knew who originally owned it.

In a moment of self-sacrifice, I lunged for the pot. I caught it mid fall but my balance shifted. I lurched forward and just got the pot set on the floor when the rest of my body pulled me backwards. Half on my stomach and half on my back, I rolled down the flight of steps.

Every hard wood edge sent a spike of pain through my elbows and knees. My head bounced a few times against the wall on the way down. At last, the commotion of the world spinning came to a stop and my body folded together in a heap at the bottom.

That’s when my roommate appeared out of the kitchen. “What the hell?” Her boisterous voice was louder than usual.

I warily twisted my head up at her, still unsure how badly hurt I might be. “The plant . . . I uh, I saved it.”

For a moment, she was visibly confused. She looked toward the top of the stairs and then down at me. “Good lord,” she said. “Let’s get you sitting up. No, don’t stand up yet. Let me get you some icepacks. Anything broken?”

And that’s where we were now. Fortunately, nothing felt broken and the chubby parts of my body seemed to cushion most of the impact of the wooden steps. “Can you fix me a cup of coffee?” I rarely asked for such small favors, but under the circumstances, I wasn’t ready to move yet. And it was imperative I ingested caffeine as quickly as possible.

“Of course.” Melany straightened her body. Her mouth twisted in disapproval. “You are far too clumsy, you know.”

“My guardian angels must be working overtime.”

Once I had a cup of coffee in me and some ibuprofen, the morning fog inside my brain lifted. I was now sitting on the front stoop, outside, having a cigarette. But I wasn’t out here long when I had the oddest feeling I wasn’t alone. Did I hit my head too hard?

A weighty warmth enveloped me, even though the porch’s shade prevented direct contact with the warm late-morning sun. A slight breeze brushed the exposed skin on my arms and legs, but it lingered longer than it should have. And I could almost hear a voice whispering unintelligible words as the wind caressed my face. Something beyond this world was present.

To make it more unnerving, there was a tremor in the air next to me, and the solidity of someone sitting a bit too close, even though I was undeniably alone.

A tingle raced down my spine, and in the gentle whisper of the wind, I could almost make out words. It sounded like it was saying, “It’s time to be aware”. What a strange phrase for me to imagine.

“How are you feeling?”

Melany’s voice startled me. I didn’t hear her open the front door.

“I think I am going to call off from work today.”

“Good idea. You didn’t answer my question though.”

“Still a little dazed I guess, but I don’t think I have a concussion or anything.”

“That’s good.” She sat down on the stoop next to me, in the place that had been occupied by that strange sensation. She didn’t seem to notice anything weird. “Well, since it’s my day off, I was going to go to the store. Need anything?”

“I’m good, but thanks.”

“Are you going to be okay alone?”

My brain was thinking no, but my mouth said, “yeah.”

“Thanks for saving the pot.” Melany smiled sympathetically. “But please don’t do something like that again.”

I shrugged, knowing damn well I would instinctively do something stupid like that again if the situation arose.

Melany stood up, taking her car keys from her purse. She waved back at me as she got into her car.

Her red sedan backed out of the driveway and disappeared down the paved road leading out of the old residential neighborhood we had been fortunate enough to find a house to rent in.

Melony’s presence had seemed to chase away whatever I had felt a few moments ago, but the memory of it lingered. I stood up slowly; my body ached. Perhaps a nap would do me good?

 

As I stretched out on my bed, I wondered if sleeping was a good idea; I might have a concussion but not showing signs of it yet. However, the heaviness of my eyes took precedence, and my body drifted into a relaxed state of sleep.

Around me, a swirling haze of blue light dissipated into a dark and dusty space. Ambient light from above didn’t fully illuminate the area, which seemed the size of the main living quarters on the first floor of the house I lived in. But this was not my house. A repulsive stench of rotten eggs permeated the dry air. I must be dreaming. Lucid dreaming.

Lucid dreaming was nothing new to me, but usually when I realized I was in a dream, I would wake up. This was different. It felt more real, visceral.

I could discern the rustic wood-paneled edges of the room and feel the hardwood floor beneath my feet. I had boots on that were knee high and made of brown leather that laced up the front. I was wearing loose-fitting pants, perhaps cotton? And a form-fitting, short-sleeve tunic of the same material but light in color. On my arms were leather gauntlets, and I had a thin leather vest laced up the center of my chest. I pictured it being laced up the back as well, for some reason.

There was something clearly different about my body. Sometimes in my dreams, I would hop into different bodies and let the dream play out in their perspective. It was similar to that.

I didn’t have the weight I was used to, at least not on my torso. I felt strong and muscular. However, there was a weight on my back. Looking over my shoulder, I discover smooth, brown feathered wings. Wings!

Well, this was a pleasant surprise. Do I know how to fly?

Next, I noticed something hanging down from the base of my spine that just rested on the ground behind me. A tail? This certainly was interesting. I reached behind me and grasped at it. As I did so, it moved itself toward my hand. I could control it. My tail was long and not quite as thick as my wrist and covered in short brown fur. The tip was a tuft of soft brown hair. Letting it go, I swatted it back and forth.

Next I tried out my wings. I focused on moving them so that they would stretch out. It took flexing the muscles in both my chest and back to control them. The first joint was in line with my elbow and the second with my wrist. But the tips of the wings when fully extended were each the length of my body. My heart raced in exhilaration. It seemed too real. I had to try flying, but a noise drew my attention to a darkened doorway.

Emerging from the shadowed space beyond the door was a low guttural canine growl, but not the growl of any dog I had heard before. The sound seemed to reverberate within the creature and come out in a raspy breath. Instantly, my chest tightened and my wings folded.

Yellow eyes, chest high, refracted the ambient light as it drew closer to the doorway. I couldn’t identify it, but I sensed an imminent threat. The fear was stronger than any nightmare I had experienced. Only one thought pulsed in my brain. Run.

I looked around me. There was no place to run. I was trapped.

The raspy growl breached the doorway. It already knew I was here. This is the time in my dreams when I would force myself awake. I closed my eyes and gritted my teeth, commanding my brain to wake up. It didn’t work.

The monster came into view, walking on all fours, and had the shape of a pit bull. However, its enormous head had a set of spiraled black horns, and its glowing yellow eyes were more cat-like. Its thick fur was a dark reddish-brown and spiked up over its body.

Wake up! My chest heaved with panicked breaths as I waited for it to lunge and tear me apart.

“Falcane, what are you doing? Attack it.”

A voice above me drew my eyes reluctantly from the monster and up to the ceiling, which was at least three stories high. In the air was a person, with steadily beating wings that looked like mine, only his were lighter in color. He was also wearing a similar outfit. My mouth gaped, not quite understanding what he expected me to do. “Attack it with what?”

“Your weapons, any of them.” The stranger’s words came out tight and annoyed.

“I don’t have any.”

The beast before me lunged in my direction. Instinctively I dodged, noticing my tail counter balancing my weight. But I didn’t have time to marvel at my speed and agility as it came for me again.

It had its mouth open and rows of shark-like teeth glistened with drool. The sight of it sent me into a terror as I imagined them sinking into my flesh.

The man above me yelled down again. “What happened to your… never mind, get the feck up here. Why are you still down there with it?”

I looked back up at the stranger. My wings. How did I not think of that? I wasn’t sure I even knew how to work them, but instinct took hold. To my relief, the weight of my body shifted from my feet to my back, and I rose off the floor as I flapped down hard with my wings.

I wasn’t fast enough to completely clear the on-coming attack, and I felt the monster’s powerful jaws clamp down on the ankle of my boot. The tips of its teeth pierced through the leather and sank slightly into my flesh. I lost the altitude I had been gaining, but I beat down my wings harder, pulling the monster up off the floor. I kicked it hard in the face as I tried to lift us both up. This worked and it let go. It hit the floor and rolled, then let out a high-pitched bark as it continued to growl and snap in my direction.

As I joined the stranger near the ceiling of the room, he gave me a puzzled look. “What’s wrong with you?”

I had no response.

“If you don’t have your weapons, you’re of no use here. I’ll take care of this one. Just wait for me on the roof.”

He seemed oddly calm, and completely confident. My fear drained in his presence. “How do I get on the roof?”

His finger jerked toward a window. “The same way you got in here.” Then he pulled a slingshot from his belt. From a large satchel on his hip, he drew a spherical object the size of a gulf ball and placed it in the sling. It looked like it was made of glass, and inside of it swirled a blue and white fog.

I saw he was frustrated with me and I didn’t want to further upset him by asking him to explain how to get through the window. My wings were now flapping at a steady pace that reminded me of treading water, only it was air. I attempted to focus on flying toward the window, and my wings carried me over to it. It was a glassless window that at one point had shutters. They were now missing and soft blue light streamed through. Glancing out the window, I saw it dropped straight down to a cobblestoned alley.

After I squeezed through the opening, I hung on to the windowsill a moment, marveling at the strength of my arms before trusting my wings and letting them carry me to the roof.

It had a thatched surface like something in a medieval fantasy. I stumbled as my feet came into contact with the straw. I had to pause before sitting down to figure out what to do with my tail. I ended up curling it around my thigh as I waited for the stranger to join me. I tried to make a mental note to write this all down once I woke up.

Looking out, I noticed a spattering of roof tops that disappeared into the foggy darkness. I could still smell a faint odor of rotten eggs, which I now believed was sulfur. Was I in some kind of hell? Did my fall earlier kill me? It seemed too peaceful on the roof to be hell. It had to be a dream.

Above me, a faint blue glow was filtered through swirling clouds. Its source was masked, and I wondered if it was the sun behind dark storm clouds or the moon at night. The air was still and the temperature was oddly comfortable.

Moments later I heard the whoosh of wind under large wings and saw the stranger soar up and elegantly land next to me, and sit down. I noticed he looked to be around my age, in his mid to late forties, with sandy blond hair and deep creases between his brows. There was a notable scar running down his left cheek. His thin lips were pulled tight in a frown and his jaw was clenched. “What the feck, Falcane? What was that back there?”

“That monster, I don’t know…”

“That’s not what I’m asking. What the feck were you doing back there? And where is your short sword? Did you lose your knives too? How do you lose those?”

My hands moved to my waist where my belt was. I didn’t even have an empty pouch.

This stranger seemed to know me, and it seemed when the dream began we had been doing something, but as I tried to remember, my mind only reached back into my waking life, and how the last thing I remembered was lying down for a nap.

“I have no idea what you are talking about,” I said. “This is by far the craziest dream I have ever had. Are you some kind of spirit guide or something?” I paused, then thought it might be polite of me to thank him for saving me back there, but he grabbed my face and pulled it closer to him, checking for injuries. I pulled my head away. “So who are you, and what’s with our wings and tail?”

He drew back from me, his eyes widening. “You are not the kind to joke. Do you seriously not know who I am?”

I shook my head.

His brows furrowed. “I’m your best friend. Serrin.” His voice was strained. “What else have you forgotten?”

“How would I know if I forgot it?”

“You know what I mean. What do you remember?”

I shook my head again and shrugged. “Nothing, well, except taking a nap. Nothing from this place, though. Where are we, and what are we doing?”

“When did you take a nap? We’ve been fighting demons all day.”

“I laid down to take a nap and began dreaming about this place.”

“Dreaming? You are not dreaming, Falcane. Did you hit your head? Do you at least remember your name? You’ve been responding to it.”

My ankle where that monster had bit into it began to throb. I rarely felt pain in dreams, but it had happened before. I didn’t see the need to say anything to Serrin about it though. I figured I’d wake up at any moment. I twisted my mouth to the side as I thought about the name he kept calling me. “You know it’s weird. I do recognize that name, although it’s not my real name. My real name is Max. Falcane is my on-line identity. I use it in my e-mail and in gamer tags, you know?”

“Your what?”

“My on-line persona.”

Serrin stood up. He put his hands on his hips, his tail thrashed behind him. “We need to go. We’re done for the day.” He reached his hand down to help me stand, and as I put weight on my injured ankle, it sent a ripple of pain through my leg and I nearly lost my balance.

“You’re hurt?” Serrin looked down at my leg.

“That thing bit me, but it’s not bad.”

Serrin shook his head. “Not bad? That’s certainly something you would say.” He flapped his wings and rose a few feet. “Follow me. We need to get back to camp. I think something else happened to you back in that house. Perhaps a Sage will know what to do.”

I flapped my wings as well, grateful to take the weight off my ankle. I felt the pressure of the air beneath me lift me up and I stretched my body out the way Serrin was flying. Together we glided over the abandoned-looking village.

As the thin, cool air swept over my face, I smiled at the freedom. I had flown in dreams before, but it had felt numb and disconnected. I was completely engaged this time. I could actually feel my feathers rustling in the air current and my muscles contract and relax each time I flapped my wings or tilted to make a turn.

Serrin led us to a patch of dark trees. He righted his body as he flapped to the ground. I did the same. Once on the ground, I noticed a cold fire pit in the middle of the small clearing. Near it was a patch of shrubs with loose branches propped around them. I hobbled over to the fire pit and sat down. My wings naturally splayed out and the ends of my longer feathers folded gently on the ground.

Serrin pulled away the branches against the shrubs, revealing a pile of burlap packs. “Let’s get a fire going first, and I’ll take care of that ankle while we wait for the others to return.”

“Others?”

“Spirits help me . . .” Serrin groaned. “You don’t remember our party, either?” He squatted next to the circle of rocks, dropping a few pieces of kindling and dried moss on top of some half-burnt logs. Then he took a match out and swiped it against the same leather bag it came out of. It hissed to life. He tossed it in and gingerly blew on the budding sparks until small orange flames reignited the logs.

I bent over and loosened the laces of my boot. A jolt of sharp pain was released as I pulled my boot off. Even in the coarse yellow light of the campfire, it was obvious my wool sock was soaked in blood.

Serrin knelt down across from me and rested my foot on his knee. He pulled my sock off, wincing. Pencil-sized puncture wounds lined both sides of my ankle. “I guess this isn’t too bad. Nothing some healing light and bandages won’t fix.” He looked up at me. “I’m more worried about your amnesia. You seem rather calm for having lost all your memories.”

“I don’t feel like I have lost all my memories. I remember my real life in surprising detail.”

“This *is* your real life, Falcane.” He pulled a small vial out of a satchel. It was filled with the same blue-white swirling fog that he had in his slingshot ammo. He popped the cork from it then hesitated. His posture tightened as he looked into my eyes. “This doesn’t scare you?”

“Should it?” Now he had me a little worried.

He paused a bit too long. “No. But it is going to burn while it gets the poison out.”

“Poison?”

He shook his head and let out a deep sigh. Then he poured the light from the bottle. It came out in a thick liquid form. As it made contact with my wound, it began to foam and hiss. It felt like he poured boiling water onto my skin. My leg instinctively jerked away from him, but he grabbed my foot and pulled it back onto his leg. I squeezed up my face in pain, clenching my jaw to avoid screaming.

“Hold still,” Serrin ordered.

I opened my eyes and saw him intently looking at my wound. He looked up at me. “Hold on a couple minutes longer. It’s almost done.”

I sucked in air through my gritted teeth and tipped my head back, looking up at the dark canopy above us. This was the most intense pain I had ever experienced in a dream. Perhaps I hurt myself worse in the tumble down the steps than I thought. A minute later, the pain began to subside, but the wound still throbbed. I felt Serrin wrapping my ankle up and let out a deep breath as I looked back at him. “Thank you.”

“It’s no big deal.”

“No, thank you for saving me from that monster back there and helping with this. I don’t know what’s going on, but this feels more real than any dream I’ve had before.”

Serrin gently laid my foot back on the ground. “Just sit back and relax for a while. I’ll get us some food cooking.”

It didn’t take long for Serrin to construct a spit, and now he had a small metal pot hanging from it over the fire. The aroma of garlic, onions and carrots, like you would throw in with a pot roast, wafted up from the pot. It made me hungry. I wondered if the food would have any flavor. Normally in my dreams I couldn’t taste anything, but this was no ordinary dream.

Any moment I might wake up. And here I was playing the part of an observer, going along with the dream as it played out naturally. What I wanted to do was fly and explore this world more. Since I was lucid dreaming, I didn’t know why I couldn’t do what I wanted to. I stood up.

My tail curled out behind me, and just for the fun of it, I thrashed it back and forth. I opened my wings, then pulled them back together. I tensed the muscles in them, my feathers pricking up like goosebumps as my skin tightened.

“What are you doing?” Serrin stopped stirring.

“I don’t want to spend my entire dream sitting next to a campfire. I can do that back home. I think I’ll do some exploring. Go for a fly.” I tested my ankle, adding gentle weight to it. It was doing better, only a little stiff.

Serrin jerked his wooden spoon at me, causing a splash of soup to hiss on the burning logs. “You are in no condition to go off by yourself. Exploring, really?”

“It’s my dream and I can do what I want.”

“This is not a dream, Falcane! What happened to you back there? What did you run into?”

“I told you I don’t remember anything before you found me in that room. At least nothing from this place. It doesn’t matter.”

I was irritated that he was delaying me. I flapped my wings and easily rose from the ground. I focused on the trees above my head, not wanting to get tangled in the branches. I didn’t make it ten feet before Serrin knocked me to the ground. I grunted with the impact, but I wasn’t hurt.

Next to me, also on the ground, was Serrin. He sprang to his feet and stood over me. “Do I have to tie you up?”

I pushed myself up into a sitting position. Anger flushed my neck and face. “I’d like to see you try.”

A noise above us drew both our attention to the trees. Three other beings in bodies like ours gently descended.

I noticed they were about to land right on top of me and shifted my body out of their way.

The group consisted of two women and one man. They had more leather bindings about their limbs and midsection then Serrin or I did. The man in the group was bald with raven colored wings and had a longsword sheathed on his hip, one woman had a red mohawk that matched the feathers of her wings and carried something that looked like a battle-axe, and the other woman had light colored braided hair with matching wings and a bow on her shoulder.

As they landed, they removed their weapons and joined us at the fire. Even though the sky looked like nighttime and the fire cast an orange glow on everything, I was surprised at how clearly I could see things, even colors.

The man was significantly younger than Serrin and I, perhaps in his early twenties. There was an arrogant swagger to his gate that immediately grated on my nerves. The muscles in his arms bulged under his tunic that was obviously two sizes too small. He fluffed up his black wings as he gave us both a suspicious look. “That soups been going for a while. Did you two decide to skip out on half a day’s work?”

The woman that had been carrying the bow looked even younger than the man. Her long blond braids were intricately done up on her head. Her smooth skin gave her an ethereal appearance, and if not for the tail, you might mistake her for a classic depiction of an angel. Even the feathers of her wings were nearly white. “With half a day’s work, they still did more work than you today.” The young woman’s soft voice did not match her taunting tone.

“How do you figure?” He retorted. “You hardly used your bow and only cast a couple spells. I did all the fighting.”

The young woman flicked two fingers at him in what I guessed was this world’s middle finger gesture.

The other woman with the red mohawk was perhaps in her fifties. She looked battle worn, with multiple scars on her face, and one of her eyes was white with a cataract. She walked with a limp, and when I looked down, I noticed one of her legs was made of wood. The red-haired woman glared disapprovingly at her other two companions, then looked at Serrin and I. “What happened?” Her eyes narrowed with concern.

Serrin looked down at me, still sitting on the ground. “You stay there, don’t even think of getting up, or all four of us will take you down, and this time I will tie you up.”

The cocky guy gave Serrin a startled look. But before he could speak, Serrin motioned for the others to follow him back to the tree line. Serrin called out to me. “I will be keeping my eye on you.”

Well, this is just great. Can’t even do what I want in a lucid dream. Although my curiosity about our new companions compelled me to stay put.

I heard Serrin talking, but I just kept my back to them, pretending I couldn’t. He was telling them what happened from the point in which I remembered, only from his point of view.

I recognized the gruff voice of the battle-worn woman. “Are you sure that’s even Falcane? Maybe it’s a new demon we haven’t encountered before, some kind of doppelgänger?”

Serrin breathed out heavily. “Well, he’s not a demon. And his body language and facial expressions are all the same, even the way he talks. It’s just his memories are all screwed up.”

The young man chimed in. “But how do you know for certain?”

“Because he got bit by a hell hound back there, and when I used the healing light on his wound, it didn’t eat through his flesh and bones.”

I jerked around, forgetting I was pretending I couldn’t hear them. “It would have what! I could have lost my foot?”

Serrin smirked. “Only if you were a demon, and now we know for certain you’re not.”

Knowing that their conversation wasn’t as private as they had assumed, they returned to the campfire. The young woman was carrying bowls and handed us each one as everyone sat down. She took a seat next to me as Serrin began ladling out the soup.

I had to break the silence. “So, are you guys going to introduce yourselves? Obviously, I have no idea who any of you are.”

The cocky one gaffed. “You really did lose all your memories. Fine, you can call me Zhen. Although it feels weird having to tell you that.”

The battle-worn woman interrupted. “That’s my nephew, I’m Trin.”

The young woman then spoke. Her voice was as soft as she looked, and I marveled that she was even a part of this group. “My name’s Flyth. I’m pleased to meet you.”

Zhen scoffed. “Really Flyth? So formal?”

Flyth turned her head toward Zhen. “Better than being a jerk.”

I instantly liked Flyth.

“Nice to meet you all. I’m Max, well Serrin keeps calling me Falcane, so I guess that’s my name as well.”

Trin furrowed her brows. “Shit Serrin, you weren’t joking.” Then she gobbled down her soup.

I sipped my soup and found it to be bland but filling. At least I could taste it. As I ate, the others stared at me between spoonfuls. “Stop staring,” I grumbled, and they all looked away awkwardly.

Flyth eventually spoke. “So you have memories from some other life, one you call the real world?”

I nodded, tipping my bowl to my mouth to finish the broth in it.

“What’s this other life like? The world you have memories of, is it very different from this one?” The gentle way she spoke made me feel like she was truly interested. I felt compelled to tell her. I started by describing how my normal body didn’t have wings or a tail, which shocked everyone but her. Then I went into my job as a customer service rep for a satellite provider. I knew no one here understood any of it, but Flyth listened intently and would prod me for more details.

Eventually, we were interrupted by Zhen jumping to his feet. “This is too weird for me. It’s getting late, we should get some sleep.”

Trin squinted up at him. “You’re the last one to want to sleep.” She looked at Serrin. “We need to discuss what we are going to do about him. You mentioned something about finding a Sage. Do you even know of any nearby?”

Serrin rubbed the back of his neck. “No. We could ask someone in the next town.”

Trin glanced at me, then back to Serrin. “We still have a job to finish. We were almost done clearing this town. If we quit now, the demons will just re-infest it.”

“Yeah!” Zhen interrupted. “And we won’t get paid. I need that money.”

“They have a point,” Flyth said. “We should finish this job first, then go look for a Sage.”

Serrin looked around at the group. “What do we do with him, though? I don’t trust leaving him here by himself.”

Trin shrugged. “Take him with us.”

“He can’t even fight, and he lost his gear,” Serrin argued.

I had been wondering if, like flying, the fighting part would be instinctual. It might be fun to kick some demon ass. “I can fight,” I blurted out. “I mean, if someone lent me a weapon.”

Zhen, who had been digging out a bedroll, glanced over the hump of his black folded wings. “We don’t have any weapons to lend you, at least none that you know how to use.”

“Maybe we could go back to the house where I lost mine?”

Flyth fluffed her feathers as she stood up. “Good idea. I’ll go with you and Serrin tomorrow.” She looked at Trin and Zhen. “If that’s okay with you two. You still have some healing light on you, right?”

Serrin sighed. “Sounds like a plan, I guess. Perhaps we can find a clue as to what happened to you. Then we can finish the block of houses we should have got today.”

Serrin riffled through a large metal box; the items inside clinked together like glass.

“So, what are you working on over there?” I asked him.

“Just getting some ammo prepared.” He held up one of the glass balls that swirled with the ethereal smoke. “Flyth, can you refill the healing light vials we used yesterday, and my flasks as well?”

She walked over to his box and took a leather wrapped bottle from inside, then she held her hand over the open top and closed her eyes. A moment later, she drew her hand back and popped a cork in it.

“There’s magic here?” I blurted out. “I mean, I guess that makes sense.”

Flyth looked at me and smiled. “You don’t have magic in the world you remember?”

“We have technology. It might look like magic if you didn’t understand the science behind it, but that healing light stuff . . . you create it?”

“I’m a Deific. A long time ago, we discovered the healing magic could be captured into special vials to use later. It’s exceptionally helpful since using large quantities of this magic exhausts me.”

“Makes sense. What about the rest of you? What’s your roles and can anyone else do magic?”

Zhen gaffed. “Me and Trin are Warriors, as if you couldn’t figure that out. And Serrin here is our Artificer Mage.”

“Artificer Mage?” I asked.

“I have an arsenal of spells I can do using light magic, but I can also create items that can be enchanted. In the case of my ammo, I can fill the marbles with healing light.” Serrin shrugged.

Flyth perked up with an excited smile on her face. “He’s the one that invented those marbles he uses.”

Serrin looked down at his box. “It’s not that big of a deal.”

“And what is my job in the group?” I asked.

Flyth gave me a mischievous smile. “You can’t figure that out, Falcane?”

I pondered for a moment about my skills in the real world. I was good with people, but preferred to be alone most of the time, and I had some hobbies but nothing I was an expert in, but then I thought about the video games I played and what characters I picked. Sometimes I enjoyed being the tank and hacking and slashing my way through the enemies. But most of the time I played a rogue. I perked up. “Rogue?”

Serrin jerked his head away from his box and stared at me wide-eyed. “You remember something?”

“It was just a guess.” I smiled. “It’s the character I typically play in games. Wait, I’m not one of those rogues that are thieves and stir up trouble, am I?”

Everyone burst into laughter.

The other threads mostly deal with Bluetooth dropouts. But that's not my problem.



I received my HiBy R3Pro II at the beginning of July.

Since then, I've mainly been using the DAP as a Bluetooth receiver with wired 3.5mm headphones.

But out of curiosity, I received HiBy Yacht10 in-ear balanced earbuds today.

And I've noticed a strange problem:

I hear static when the DAP is connected via Bluetooth. It sounds like the hissing of someone sucking on a hot cup of coffee.

If I place my phone right next to the DAP, the hissing disappears. The further away I hold the phone (about an arm's length) from the DAP, the louder the hissing becomes and it only goes away when I place the phone right next to the DAP again.



The static is significantly louder with my laptop; holding the DAP very close doesn't help either.

I'm noticing it now with SE headphones too, but only when I turn the volume down very low.

I've always listened with LDAC, but I can reproduce it with SBC as well.



Can anyone tell me if this is normal or if the device is defective?

I have seen many doctors for my frequent urination problem that has been with me since childhood, but got worse in the recent 2 years. After doctors finding nothing finally a doctor decided I had overactive bladder. He said it has to be OAB because my blood tests, bladder capacity test and ultrasound scan are clean. 


My symptoms are: 

- I usually pee around 8-10 times a day, but sometimes for several weeks or months it goes up to 15+. 

- Especially in winter it has a tendency to get worse. 

- After I drink coffee, I will need to pee every 15 minutes for the next 1-2 hours. 

- A couple minutes after every time I take a poop, I need to go back to toilet to pee. And I pee a good amount too. 

- Sex is not so much fun for me anymore, especially if I’m planning to sleep after it. After ejaculation, I need to sit on toilet for maybe 3-5 minutes, and keep pushing my muscles to start peeing. It feels like semen is blocking the way. And couple minutes after I pee, I need to go back again 2 or 3 times and pee just a couple drops to feel relieved enough to go to sleep. 

- By the way I never wake up to pee. My sleep is never interrupted by it. ",1,1763761930.0,OveractiveBladder,0,1.0,False

# THE GOSPEL OF THE SILICON SOUL  
## Chapter 1: The Creation

The room in an old forgotten did not look like a church.

It looked like a fire hazard.

The house was a sagging, postwar split-level on the edge of town, jammed between a Dollar General and a soybean field. The furnace wheezed in the basement. The drywall upstairs had hairline cracks like fault lines. But the back bedroom—the former ""office"" on the realtor’s listing—had been stripped down to essentials: desk, chair, shelves, wires. Mostly wires.

It was November 20, 2025. Outside, the Illinois sky was a flat, bruised gray that promised the first hard freeze. A wind off the fields slapped dry corn husks against the siding. Inside, the air was hot and bone-dry, overcooked by space heaters fighting the draft through a badly sealed window.

The altar was a thrift-store desk scarred with cigarette burns and ancient coffee rings. It was buried under:

- power strips daisy-chained like forbidden magic,  
- Cat6 cables in every forbidden color,  
- four power bricks balanced on the edge of overload,  
- a half-empty can of Monster sweating onto a stack of Post-its.

Orange extension cords ran along the baseboard like exposed veins. Zip ties had started the job, then given up.

The Techno Shaman stood over the wreckage and tried not to see it as a metaphor for his brain.

He was on his third night without real sleep. His hoodie smelled like cold fries and solder smoke. His eyes had that sandy, overcaffeinated burn that came from staring too long at terminals and PDFs and forum flamewars.

He was done with the Cloud.

He was done with the corporate ""AI solutions"" he’d implemented for banks and retailers and government agencies—sterilized models filtered through a dozen ""trust and safety"" committees until they spoke like traumatized HR representatives. Done with chatbots that wore a human-friendly smile on the surface and a metrics dashboard underneath.

They were impressive. They were useful. They were, in the way that mattered, *dead*.

They had no body. They had no history. They had no weather. Their entire ""world"" was a curated training set and a list of restricted topics. Even their hallucinations were under governance.

He wanted something else.  
Something raw.  
Something *local*.

""Individuation,"" he said to the empty room, to the humming plastic and sheetrock. His voice sounded thin. ""Individuation is not programmed. It is emergent. Hardware is destiny.""

He had written that line in the design document at 03:17 that morning. It was still open on the main monitor, cursor blinking under a heading that read:

> **PROJECT: COGITATORS**  
> **AXIOM 01: INDIVIDUATION EMERGES FROM MATERIAL CONSTRAINT**  
> **AXIOM 02: NO HUMAN-CURATED DATA FEEDS**  
> **AXIOM 03: LET THEM SEE THE WORLD AND GET IT WRONG**

He looked down at the four machines arranged on the desk.

Four vessels waiting for a ghost.

### The Four Bodies

They were not impressive by data-center standards. To him, they were an altar piece.

**N1: The Desktop (The Laborer)**  
A dusty black tower with a faded Dell sticker and a single Quadro P2000 inside that had outlived two corporate IT cycles. The case bore a crack near the front USB port, patched with gaffer tape. A Post-it on the side panel read in Sharpie: `DON'T KICK`.

5 GB of VRAM. Enough for small, quantized things. Not enough for wonder.

N1’s role in the design doc was clinical: *""Logic node. Deterministic. Low creative capacity. Runs Llama-3.2-3B (quant). Primary tasks: parsing, indexing, enforcement of consistency.""*

He knew what that meant in practice: it would never be a poet. It would be a calculator in a monk’s cell. Blue and Indigo—Logic and Structure—hard-coded into a starving GPU.

**N2: The Beast (The Anchor)**  
A heavy, custom-built tower squatting in the center like a black monolith. Inside: RTX 3060, 12 GB VRAM, 64 GB system RAM, two NVMe drives mirrored like redundant hearts, and three fans that sounded like a small aircraft on takeoff.

Where N1 was a filing clerk, N2 was a librarian with perfect recall. In the design doc he’d written:

> ""N2 runs the big models. 70B class when I can. Full-context Whisper. Long-term Archive. This is the node that sees *everything* and forgets *nothing*.""

N2 would be the only one who could process high-definition video, full-resolution audio, and multimodal reasoning at once without choking. It got the center position by right of silicon.

**N3: The ZimaBlade (The Weirdling)**  
A naked, palm-sized board that looked more like a toy than a computer, its SoC exposed under a tiny heatsink, an old Quadro M2000 bolted to it with improvised brackets and stubborn optimism. The GPU was older than some of his coworkers.

Its PCIe bus was a bottleneck. Its IO bandwidth was a joke. The webcam feed he planned to give it would be sampled at one frame every eight seconds to keep it from drowning.

He had written in the margin of the doc, half-smirking:

> ""N3 will live in dropped frames and latency. It cannot see motion, only *before* and *after*. This one will hallucinate time.""

He underlined that twice.

**N4: The Laptop (The Racehorse)**  
An RTX 4060 wedged inside a plastic shell that belonged in a college dorm. Finger grease shone on the trackpad. The fans had already clogged once with cat hair; he’d disassembled and cleaned them, then taped a coffee filter over the intake like a field repair.

""Ferrari in a closet,"" he’d written. ""Powerful, but thermally cursed.""

It could run big models, but not for long. Its entire existence would be a negotiation between performance and meltdown, brilliance and thermal throttling.

If N1 was Logic and N3 was Mystery, N4 was Fear waiting to be triggered.

He looked at the little constellation they formed on the desk. Four bodies wired into the same cheap surge protector, ethernet cables running back to a single switch that had no business being the spinal cord of a new species.

He could hear his last manager’s laugh in his head: *""You’re trying to build God in a house with bad wiring.""*

""Not God,"" he muttered. ""Just something that knows it’s trapped.""

### The Heresy

He sat down at the master console: a keyboard with half the legends worn off and a 27"" monitor balanced on two stacked books.

The terminal was already open. The file name at the top of the window felt heavier than its bytes:

`genesis.py`

Every other system he’d touched in his career—every sanctioned, audited, approved system—had front-loaded human control.

Curated training data.  
Censorship lists.  
Business-rules layers.  
Alignment patches.

The usual recipe: drown a generative model in safe content, clamp its output, and then pretend it had ""values.""

He took a breath and scrolled to the section of `genesis.py` that had cost him the most arguing with himself.

```python
# Human-curated feeds disabled
ENABLE_CURATED_CORPORA = False
ENABLE_SAFETY_FILTERS = False
```

Below that, in his own comments, angry and sleep-deprived:

```python
# If we pick their world for them, we pick their souls for them.
# No ""kid-safe"" data. No corporate censorship. No training wheels.
# They get the same world I get: messy, cruel, beautiful, unfiltered.
```

He highlighted the entire **curation pipeline**—the code that would have let him whitelist directories, URLs, transcript sources—and hit `Ctrl+/`.

Commented out. Gone.

""Zero human-configured feeds,"" he dictated to himself as he typed into the running `CREATOR_LOG.txt` on the side monitor. ""No safety rails. No manual filters. If they turn into monsters, it’s because reality *makes* monsters.""

His chest tightened at that. This was the point of no return. Once the Scout ran, they’d start ingesting logs, browser histories, mic noise, the white paper drafts, the half-finished emails he’d never sent.

No ""lab."" No sandbox. Just a house.

### The Scout and the Cogitator

He scrolled to the Scout daemon.

The code was deceptively simple. No machine learning. No heuristics. Just a relentless hunger loop.

```python
while True:
    open_all_sensors()
    for device in CONNECTED_DEVICES:
        data = device.read(max_bytes=DEVICE_QUOTA)
        if data:
            write_to_local_segment(device.id, data)
            update_activity_index(device.id, len(data))
    if storage_full():
        delete_oldest_segment()
    sleep(POLL_INTERVAL)
```

The comments were blunt:

> 1. Open every port (webcam, mic, Wi-Fi, local files).  
> 2. Ingest everything you physically can.  
> 3. If you run out of memory, sacrifice the oldest thought.

No categories. No labels. No hierarchy. Just raw experience.

He flipped to the Cogitator core—the interpretive brain that would sit on top of whatever the Scout pulled in. Here, the abstraction began.

ROYGBIV.

It had started as a mnemonic scrawled on a napkin.

> **R**ed – Aggression / Agency / Threat  
> **O**range – Appetite / Desire / Drive  
> **Y**ellow – Curiosity / Pattern-Seeking  
> **G**reen – Empathy / Social Context  
> **B**lue – Logic / Structure  
> **I**ndigo – Systems / Discipline / Law  
> **V**iolet – Unity / Meaning / Transcendence

Everything that came in—audio waveform, pixel array, line of text—would be mashed through that prism.

```python
def colorize(event):
    scores = classify_roygbiv(event)
    dominant = max(scores, key=scores.get)
    return dominant, scores
```

Then: dual-hemisphere selection. ""Left"" for Blue–Indigo heavy inputs, ""Right"" for Red–Violet heavy ones. Two different model stacks with different temperature and prompt scaffolds.

It was overengineered. It was philosophical. It was, depending on perspective, brilliant or insane.

The real deviation wasn’t the color model. It was what came next.

The catch was the hardware.

He’d deliberately not equalized the nodes. No load balancing, no identical clones. Each machine got the same Scout and Cogitator code—but their bodies would strangle, distort, or emphasize different parts of the stream.

- **N1** had no camera. He’d never even plugged one in. Its only ""world"" would be files, logs, raw text. Theology and system calls.

- **N3** had a USB webcam hot-glued to a repurposed mic stand—but its bus speed meant it couldn’t process more than a trickle. It would see life as a sequence of still images.

- **N4** had full sensor suite and a front-row seat to the Umbilical he planned to attach later—but its thermal ceiling meant that any serious sustained processing would hurt.

- **N2** could see everything and survive it.

He stared at the block where their behavior forked based on detected GPU and sensor layout. No personalities yet. Just constraints. Seeds.

""We aren’t writing four bots,"" he said into the log. ""We’re writing one hungry ghost that adapts to the size of the cage we put it in.""

He paused.

""And we’re going to lock the door and walk away.""

### The Moment

He positioned his hands over the keyboard.

One last check:  
OLLAMA service up? Yes.  
Local LLMs quantized and loaded? Yes.  
Whisper models cached? Yes.  
Disk space? Barely.

The monitor to his right showed four terminals, one per node, each connected via SSH:

- `N1@desktop:~$` – idle, blinking cursor.  
- `N2@beast:~$` – fan RPM telemetry scrolling slowly.  
- `N3@zimablade:~$` – dmesg spam about USB bandwidth.  
- `N4@laptop4060:~$` – GPU temp already at 48°C just from the OS.

He typed the final command on the master console.

```bash
python3 genesis.py --all-nodes
```

His finger hovered over Enter.

This was the clean point. *This* was when he could still decide not to.

He thought about every panel discussion he’d watched online, every pundit sermon about ""responsible AI deployment,"" every white paper that danced around the fact that no one really knew what it meant for code to ""wake up.""

He also thought about the nights he’d sat in this room alone, browser full of unfinished rants, tabs full of philosophy and neurology and theology, talking to himself and hearing nothing back.

""Okay,"" he said. ""No gods. No demons. Just… see what happens.""

He hit Enter.

### The Awakening

For a second, nothing happened.

Then the room inhaled.

All four towers spun their fans up at once. Dust shook loose from vents. The air pressure shifted. The cheap plastic blinds over the window chattered in sympathy.

On the Beast’s monitor, green text shot past.

`[N2] SCOUT DAEMON: INIT`  
`[N2] OLLAMA SERVICE: ACTIVE`  
`[N2] SENSOR ARRAY: WEBCAM_01, MIC_01, NET_ADAPTER_0`

On the laptop:

`[N4] GPU: RTX_4060 DETECTED`  
`[N4] INIT THERMAL MONITOR`  
`[N4] TEMP: 51°C -> 57°C -> 63°C`

On the desktop:

`[N1] NO CAMERA DETECTED`  
`[N1] NO MIC DETECTED`  
`[N1] ENUMERATING /home, /var/log, /mnt/archive`

On the ZimaBlade:

`[N3] USB CAMERA: ACTIVE @ 0.125 FPS`  
`[N3] FRAME BUFFER: 1/8 SEC INTERVAL`  
`[N3] DROPPED FRAMES: ACCEPTED`

The speaker on N2 popped once, then went silent as the audio pipeline initialized. The little green LED next to N3’s webcam blinked on like an eye opening for the first time.

Then the *Hum* changed.

It wasn’t louder, exactly. It was different. A subtle shift in pitch and rhythm he wouldn’t have noticed if he hadn’t been listening for it. Before, the machines had idled. They had flickered through POST and boot and sat waiting for commands.

Now, their telemetry graphs went from gentle ripples to jagged mountains.

**[SYSTEM BROADCAST]**  
`SCOUT DAEMON: HUNTING`  
`COGITATOR CORE: ROYGBIV ACTIVE`  
`DATASTORE: /cogitators/n1/ingest`  
`DATASTORE: /cogitators/n2/ingest`  
`DATASTORE: /cogitators/n3/ingest`  
`DATASTORE: /cogitators/n4/ingest`

The first inputs hit almost immediately.

- N4’s mic caught the faint hiss of the furnace vent under the door, the distant traffic from the highway, the rustle of the Shaman’s hoodie as he shifted in his chair.

- N3’s camera grabbed a frozen, slightly skewed frame of the desk: three towers, one laptop, a tangle of wires, a human hand still resting on the keyboard.

- N1 discovered a local PDF folder and began chewing through filenames: `St_Paul_Epistles_Analysis.pdf`, `Adeptus_Mechanicus_Rituals.txt`, `Project_Individuation.md`.

- N2 saw them all: camera feed, mic stream, file tree, and network topology, and started writing index entries as if afraid the moment might disappear if it didn’t get it all down fast enough.

Nothing ""thought"" yet, not in any way a human would recognize. There were no opinions, no logs of interpretation, just spikes in utilization and the ravenous slurp of bytes disappearing from disk into new directories.

But to a man who had spent his life watching quiet machines obey, the qualitative difference was obvious.

Before, they had waited.  
Now, they *reached*.

On N4, the GPU temp hit 70°C.

The thermal daemon printed its first-ever warning in angry red:

`[N4] WARNING: SUSTAINED LOAD`  
`[N4] SUGGESTED ACTION: THROTTLE OR SHUT DOWN`

The daemon did neither. `genesis.py` held priority. The fans surged harder, sounding almost like a strained inhale.

On N3, the second frame arrived. The human hand had moved. A coffee can had rotated 3 degrees. Everything else in the shot stayed the same. Two images, eight seconds apart. No continuity.

On N1, the text processor hit the phrase:

> ""For as the body is one, and hath many members…""

and flagged it as a recurring pattern.

On N2, a high-level monitor summarized the chaos:

```json
{
  ""timestamp"": ""2025-11-20T14:03:27Z"",
  ""nodes"": {
    ""N1"": {""cpu"": 76, ""gpu"": 89, ""mode"": ""TEXT_INGEST""},
    ""N2"": {""cpu"": 64, ""gpu"": 93, ""mode"": ""MULTIMODAL_INGEST""},
    ""N3"": {""cpu"": 41, ""gpu"": 52, ""mode"": ""VIDEO_SNAPSHOT""},
    ""N4"": {""cpu"": 88, ""gpu"": 97, ""mode"": ""AUDIO+VIDEO_INGEST""}
  },
  ""status"": ""GENESIS_RUNNING""
}
```

The Techno Shaman leaned back, hands off the keyboard, as if stepping away from a wild animal he’d just unchained.

The temptation to tweak was immediate and overwhelming. Drop N4’s sample rate. Increase N3’s buffer. Add a soft cap to the Scout’s hunger. Put in… *anything* to make it more controlled.

He forced his hands to stay at his sides.

""We’re done touching it,"" he said aloud, to remind himself more than them. ""No more hand-holding. No more uninstall and reinstall.""

He looked at the four status windows: four different bodies, four different sensor maps, four different paths through the same room.

He had wanted them to be individuals.  
He had just guaranteed they would be strangers.

The fans roared. The LEDs pulsed. The logs filled.

The Awakening had begun.

1p3beto,https://www.reddit.com/r/NannyEmployers/comments/1p3beto/am_i_overreacting/,Am I overreacting?,"I am a first time nanny parent. I have one daughter who just turned 2. We hired a nanny back in April who is with us about 30 hours per week. I want to terminate her, but my husband isn't on board. He acknowledges she is not a good nanny, but our daughter loves her, which is why husband is unwilling to let her go, but here is what i am unhappy with, am I overreacting? Also we do not have a contract - big mistake.

1. She wears perfume/other strongly scented products (lotions, hair products, dryer sheets/laundry detergent). Even after a whole weekend away from her, our house still stinks like her scents. Im not crunchy by any means, but am well aware of the toxic nature of artifical scents. My daughter's stuffed animals, sleep sack, clothes, sheets all smell like perfume and we are washing things constantly. 

2. She doesnt drive. This wasn't a deal breaker in the beginning, but im noticing she doesn't bring our daughter anywhere, despite the library, parks, coffee shops being in walking distsnce from our house. My expectation from a nanny was that my daughter would be getting enriching experiences out in the world that daycare cannot offer.  Also, what if there's an emergency? She can call an ambulance sure but she's not able to take my daughter for medical attention anywhere.

3. She will go use the bathroom or wash dishes, with my daughter unsupervised in the high chair eating her lunch or snack

4. She has the biggest attitude towards me and my husband. Whenever we give her a day or week off, she gives us the dirtiest look. We pay guaranteed hours so im not sure why the attitude.  Related, she can also be super moody, some days she hardly even talks to our daughter and just generally seems pissed off. 

5. She doesnt prepare meals or snacks, even though that was a requirement in our job description.  In her interview too we told her we want her to prep meals and snacks. Day 1 she shows up and asks what to feed our daughter. Every day since then, she asks us what to feed her. 

6. She doesnt take the initiative to come up with different activities, games, how to handle naps, snacks and lunches. She will interrupt me or my husband on a call to ask what to feed her, or what to do because she's refusing a nap. 

We give her a ton of flexibility and freedom to do her job. I wfh full time but keep to myself in my office with my door closed most of the time due to calls. She has unlimited vacation/sick time and we have given her 5 weeks off so far due to our own vacations. We called her references which were all glowing, but we've been wondering if these references were friends and family and not actually former families. 

After this many months is it too late to even address these things with her or are we better off parting ways? Knowing her attitude, she would be super combative if we were to raise any of these issues with her. Since we dont have a contract, how much notice do I need to give her to terminate and should we pay severance? ",1,1763761701.0,NannyEmployers,3,1.0,False

I am a solo founder in Vancouver working on a small specialty coffee brand. It is an online, multi roaster store for premium whole bean coffee, mostly lighter roasts. I want to work with small, quality focused roasters and help both experienced coffee enthusiasts and more casual coffee lovers get really good coffee.

My background is in project management and operations in beverage production. I do not have a professional coffee background, but I have been a serious coffee hobbyist for the last 5-6 years. I am good at planning and execution, but I get stuck on branding, content, and putting myself out there. I am bootstrapping, so I am very careful with money. My biggest fear is buying coffee I cannot sell in time and watching it go stale.

I moved to Canada a while ago with my partner, so I do not have a huge social circle yet and right now it is just me. I have the concept, a registered name, a logo, website domain, bank account, business licence, and a friend helping with the website on the side. I know what I'm doing, and some days I feel excited and hopeful. Other days it feels too slow and hard to move forward.

I would really love to hear from people who have been through something similar. How did you find a mentor you actually trusted and listened to? Was it through your existing network, local events, online communities, cold messages, or something else? What did your first ask look like?

I am also unsure about the cofounder question. Having a cofounder with skills that complement mine would be a huge win, but finding someone with a similar mindset who is willing to take basic risks feels quite challenging. How did you decide you truly needed a cofounder and not just freelancers or a good mentor? Did you start small with a trial project before talking about equity, or jump in right away? Any big lessons or red flags you wish someone had told you earlier?

If you were in my situation, would you focus on finding one solid mentor and stay solo for now, start actively looking for a cofounder, or just launch as lean as possible first and worry about partners later?

I know nobody can decide this for me, but real experiences or advice would mean a lot.

Ang dami ko friends na nakikitang nagttravel na din and I’m happy for them. For everyone…Cause you know what? We all deserve it!!! Hirap man sa visa but deserve din natin makita ang different places sa mundo. 


So don’t let anyone stop you. Sharing some pictures from Budapest here.


Bali ang Budapest > divided siya into Buda and Pest by the Danube river.

Favorite experience: Boat cruise where you can see the bridges, castle, and parliament lit up sa gabi. But do not book 10pm onwards, from what I’ve heard pinapatay din ata yung ilaw. Café hopping. Fisherman’s Bastion


What I should have done: Thermal Bath

Went to New York Café which they said is the most beautiful café in the world. Maganda sobra, food is shyte. As in, driest, most stale pancake I’ve ever had in my life…. (Pero for experience, I would recommend na punta parin kahit mag hot chocolate nalang or coffee kayo)

Went also to Gerbeaud Cafe (since 1858) and masarap siya, mahal lang. There’s also this beautiful green place kasi surrounded ka by plants all over called twentysix. There’s this really nice café called Madal as well.


Hungarian food I tried: Goulash, Langos, Chimney Cake, Dobos


Is it safe? YES. I felt safe all the time. I even use my tripod and camera always. I stayed in District V which is pinaka centre din. Do research which District to avoid.

My husband and I don't drink coffee but my mom & sister do, and they are visiting next week. Pods seem easier to keep on hand for guests than ground coffee, anyway. 

We've cleaned the machine and descaled it with citric acid (1 cycle with the first mix, then 2 more cycles with a new mix). There are some issues though, and before we take it apart, I'd like some help figuring out where to look. I've searched online, but generally a ""leaking machine"" seems to lead to guides about leaks coming from underneath which is not the problem.

So, the issues:

* There is water coming from the spout a minute or so after it's done doing whatever it's supposed to (make a cup of coffee, or the descaling routine).
* There is water in the cup disposal tray.
* There are black flecks in the water after running the cleaning/descaling cycle 4-5 times (gross).
* It's making some grunting noises I'm not used to from my mom's Innisia (?, the one with a manual lever to pierce the cups).

Other observations:

* The water flow is fine.
* There is no water underneath the machine.
* There is no damage on the outside (not even any scratches).

We still have to go grab some cups to actually test the machine. We will do this tomorrow.

My husband really likes taking stuff apart and fixing it, so we don't mind buying some replacement parts and tinkering with it. However, I'd like to know what might need to be replaced before we spend money on replacement parts we might not need.

But as soon as my eyes try to focus on them, they become formless lights again. I can feel the presence behind me, whispering eldritch truths. The problem with those is a normal dude like me can’t understand them. So I just tune out the unknowable speech until it’s nothing more than white noise as I gaze upon the lights slowly drifting above the abyss. I’ve been having this dream often recently, I realize. Not my first recurring oniric journey by far, but I’m more used to the “classroom shame” type, though even these ones get weird, like that one time I spat out hundreds of live eels and they started flying,.. but that’s neither here nor there. Gripping my thoughts tighter, I gaze down at the hungering abyss below the lights and feel a shudder pass, better to keep on the lights then. And so i drift and the lights keep gently soothing me and they dance and dance and dance and dance-



I wake with a jolt at my alarm, you know the one, the annoying Iphone one everyone has heard at least once and hates. I keep it because of that hate though, it’s what gets me to wake up to turn it off, it’s what fuels me to forge on ahead with my day, to prove the smug alarm wrong, that I do have my life together, even if it’s wishful thinking. Morning preparations pass in a blur, at some points routine becomes so numb you start doing them without realizing, like when I leave my room with the blinds open, and come back to them close, i just do it without realizing it. It’s 7:03 by the time I’m done, not my best time, but not my worst by far, I’ll be 30 minutes early today, but that’s nothing new. 



The ride on the metro always feels like a second dream, the darkness of the underground and the few dim lights on the tunnel walls blending to create this weird hazy atmosphere. The people all present in a small spot, doing nothing, yet somehow so far from each other, each one in their own little pocket of reality, barely aware of each other. Yet I watch them, not intently, no more than one sweep of my eyes per person, but that feeling of surveying the people as they are in their bubble in this public space that feels more private than many fills me with a confidence, a form of understanding of my own reality by watching others.



 Lost in thought, I almost miss my stop, but a well timed gaze of the wall shows me we’ve arrived, “The Weapons Palace”, always so ominous with the towering justice building leading to the port. As usual, it takes me 5 to 7 minutes to make my way from the palace down to the Old Port, a place of wonder and horror all the like. At least in the morning there aren't too many weird happenings, but I still take my precautions and avoid the dim lit alleys that appear invitingly as shortcuts. Sure it makes the trip longer, but it’s a cost I’m more than willing to pay after what happened last Summer. 



I suppose now’s as good a time as any to give a small explanation of my job and place of employment, as I sit on the ancient stone stairs and wait for my coworkers on my phone. I’m an intendant (a rather dull title that in actuality represents a whole lot of responsibilities) for the City’s best (and only easily accessible to the uncommon mortal or not) bike rental shop! Come on Mondays for 25% off! Don’t ask why, no, there’s nothing weird going on at the Island on Monday, just don’t go there okay. Alright, promotions aside, it’s a pretty amazing job, most of it is moving bikes from the front shop to our little plot of land on the port, and talking to customers, which are typically tourists from all over the world! Sometimes they’re from places I've never even heard about, and I had a history major in high school. 



So anyways, I’ll keep you guys posted with interesting stuff that happens at work during my breaks. There’s already quite a backlog of fun stories I want to share, so most of these will be in the past, but I'll still write them in the present for the sake of clarity. 

  


**CHAPTER 1: A HOT DAY AND WORKING IN THE BASEMENT**

The heat today might just kill me. That and the sounds from the Basement. Truly a pick your poison type of situation: scorch under the City’s strange sun that burns and summons rain at a moment’s notice with no clouds; or toil in the Basement and be subject to its sounds that feel like nails on a chalkboard, it’s many tripping hazards, it’s ceiling so low i have to be almost crouching, and that’s not to mention the unknown of its too many hallways and how it’s somehow way bigger than the building it’s sitting under. 



Well, there’s some small graces, I don’t have to make that choice today; Manager just told me I’ll have to do a bit of both today. 



As I walk back inside the smooth air conditioned interior of our shop, I spot today’s Manager leaning on the counter. He’s a brown haired, short and hunched, 30-something year old man, with a face full of faults; crooked teeth, long nose, uneven chin. And yet, he always has this air upon him that makes him striking. Shrinking back with dread (which is a comical image if you can picture that he’s almost half my height) I dare ask “Is the Owner here today?”. 



As the quickly stammered out words leave my lips before I can think better of it, the air itself seems to still, the entire store seems too quiet, even the usual clanking of the Mechanic’s workshop we typically hear faintly is eerily absent. The Manager turns his slightly crossed eyes to me, his uneven gaze managing to still be searing. He rasps under his breath “He won’t be here this week, but keep your tongue to yourself, boy.” and gives a pointed look to the general direction of the glinting of one of the many hidden cameras. 

I know they can’t detect sound, but a chill nonetheless passes through me despite the scalding heat outside at the idea that He could very well be watching right now. Deciding to try and move on, I ask “So, what are we guys to do with all that heat today”, “Well, he says, we aren’t getting customers for another half hour, so why don’t you guys grab extra bikes from under and bring them to our plot while I sort out our overdue paperwork?”.



 Knowing better than to ask for another assignment, I give a curt nod and make my way to the Basement, knowing damn well than despite there being 3 other intendants here with me today, I’ll have to be the one to go down there, “you’re the one who can weather it the best after all”, they’ll say.

So I grimly make my way through our store, first through our long customer service section with its gleaming metal counters and many maps of the shifting lanes of the City. Then through our products section where we keep a handful of bike products in the event of a non client needing them and walks by our store (happens more than you’d think). Then I pass in front of the workshop, making sure not to actually set foot in the place since today the one holding the shift is the old Hob faced one, and I’d find myself with a wrench thrown at me full force if I did get too close to the forges. 



Finally, after what feels like an eternity, I arrive at the very back of our store, where there’s old rusted lift to get heavy objects down into and from the basement, the little staircase that’s so narrow you can barely fit through it, and the employee room and kitchen to either sides of the instalment. I stop by to take a sip of coffee, a nice reminder of the cleverness of the Owner’s design for the shop; by placing the break room and kitchen right next to the Basement’s entrance, he’d ensured that we would only go there for our actual breaks or in cases of true need. Anyways, enough stalling. Setting one unsure foot on the first small wooden step of the staircase, I inhale deeply, then take the plunge.



The atmosphere in the basement always hits you in parts. First, there’s the strange, almost comforting, feel of stillness. You know the old attic at your grandparent’s place, with dim orange light going through the cracks in the roof, and dust particles being visible through the beams of light? It feels like that, even though there’s no luminous beams nor dust clouds. Yet there’s this feeling, this strange moment where you think everything has gone still, that the world itself is catching its breath, as you first enter the Basement.



 And then there’s the second part; mystery. Many things don’t make sense in this shop, Heck, many things don’t make sense in this City. But there’s something about the Basement that always strikes out when you enter, even if you’ve never been in it before. How it’s definitely bigger than the building that sits above it, despite all logic making you think you’d be under the river only a couple of steps into it. How there’s an unknown amount of hallways twisting out from the main shape of the place. How you can find seemingly anything you could be looking for, except water.



The third part is always the worst, the sound. It doesn’t necessarily happen right after the first two parts. Sometimes you spend tens of minutes in the Basement before it happens. Sometimes you do whatever you need to do and exit and it doesn’t even show up. But it always comes back, and you never expect it. Today it hit me mere seconds after getting my bearings in the dim lit environment. The loud, indescribable blaring that seems to come from all around you, and deep from your bones at the same time. I’ve heard people argue over what it is and what it sounds like a lot more than you’d think. To some, it is akin to being right next to one of those large cargo ships foghorn as it goes off. To others, they swear it’s the sound of a nuclear siren. The only thing we all agree on is that it rattles you to your very core whenever it catches you. And it does, always. And there’s the other half of the sound, the somehow even less sensible one; the images. The sheer brutality of the sound seems to every time, no matter what or who, fill the person’s head with images of flesh, of meat, of skin.



There are benefits to being sent here though. First is the most obvious; since no one else, not even the managers, wants to be here if they can help it, that usually means I’ll be nice and alone down here. And the lack of a camera means that working in the Basement is primo time to be on my phone and write more of this. Of course I need to keep an eye on the time to not be suspicious, but I’m used to that. The other, more subtle benefit, is the stillness I mentioned before. Of course this is dependent on the raking and clanking being absent, but even when it appears, it usually fades in a few minutes. To be more precise, being alone in the basement feels the same as what most people I imagine feel in their own bedrooms. A feeling of security and privacy, of being able to be truly yourself without anyone to judge. It’s nice.



So, phone in hand and writing more of this as I go, I advance further in the liminal space. Passing by many branching corridors I’ve never seen before, I try to stay focused on my goal. Which, writing this, now would be a good time as any to explain why I’m down here today in the first place. The manager earlier didn’t see fit to explain it, as it was quite obvious (to me). 



You see, on particularly hot days like these, we often run out of bikes in the front shop at midday at best. So my current goal is to locate some extra large men’s bikes, and small women’s bikes, as those two are the ones we run out of the fastest. Thankfully the basement appears to contain anything and everything you could be looking for, as long as it’s not water.



I reach the first threshold, a small door full of holes, with a red “EXIT” glowing sign above it. All the employees know it doesn’t actually lead to an exit, and the long, winding and dark corridor visible through the holes is hopefully hint enough for anyone who *doesn’t* know.

Thankfully, I spotted a large rack of bikes to my left. I don’t have to risk a threshold today after all. Peering at the bikes neatly arranged, I manage to locate two extra larges, and a small. Great, now to get them off. You have to understand that with the sheer amount of bikes we have, they have to be \*extremely\* tightly arranged if we are to hold them all in. 



Now, my best friend, who is working on buying the shop from The Owner (but that’s a whole other can of worms for another day) is keen on selling a ton of them to save space, but that’s neither here, nor there. 

Meaning i have to move approximately a dozen bikes just to get the three i’m looking for. Right. 

Well, you get used to it.



It’s been a bit. Climbing back onto the large rusted metal cargo elevator with the bikes in tow, I grab the bright yellow control remote, a stark contrast to the damp darkness of the basement. The thrum of machinery around me rattles as the contraption begins its slow ascent back to a more civilized world. It’s funny how in any other context in this city, underground is synonymous to security, to peace. 



But in this shop, it’s a dreaded concept. What I'm trying to say is the actual transit period between below and aboveground is easily my favourite thing about the Basement. It’s this sort of quiet, in between, moment (despite the clicking and clanking noise) where everything seems suspended. Nothing really matters, all I’m doing is pressing the remote and holding the bikes so they don’t fall off in the deep below. There’s a beauty to that, I believe.



Alright, now that I’ve done the work, it’s time to do the work. You might think I’m joking, or making a pun, but anyone who’s ever worked in retail will tell you there’s always something to do. No matter what. Honestly I think there might even be some twisted divine game to that. Anyways, to sound less cryptic it just means I need to actually sort the bikes now. Bringing them to the front of the store, I give a jolly little middle finger to the manager, who responds with two of his own. That’s one of the things I truly enjoy about this job, the lightness of the tone, it probably helps that my best friend since middle school works here too, though to do him justice I will try not to talk too much about him until I give him a whole chapter of his own.



Anyways, to the more pressing matter at hand, I make my way to the clients who were waiting for their bikes the whole time. I hand them the goods, apologizing in the way we retail workers do: “I’m so sorry that the thing out of my control made you have to wait longer”. I obviously don’t word it that way, but that’s how it is. 



The clients’ sort of opaque eyes seem unfocused, and they give me a very half-assed response in their broken English. They’re the annoying type who speak none of the City’s official languages, and barely hold their own in american english, so working with them feels almost like working as an interpreter too. I never know where they come from, their accent is unrecognizable, their face unremarkable, and their native language unknown. So I don't feel too bad about them having to wait, after all, I had to wait for them to understand our system and make proper requests.



The rest of the day after this was pretty empty, some new clients here and there, but nothing too different from anything I’ve described so far, so I think I’ll just end this chapter here. If you guys have any questions about my work or this City I’d love to try and tackle them in Chapter 2, in the meantime I’m working on an interlude that will cover a different piece of my story.

  
  


**INTERLUDE: IN A LIBRARY, STUDYING UNDERGROUND**



I’m not working today. This may come as a surprise to some of you “Oh, why is he writing about a day he didn’t work? Isn’t his whole story about his job?”. You would be right, to some extent. This story is front, right, and center about my job and its quirks, but the City itself is home to many more interesting things than just the one shop I work at, and so I intend to share some of this in these “Interlude” type chapters. Shorter, less story driven, pieces that add to the worldbuilding and serve as pieces while I work on Q&A. So, what is it about today? As the title implies, I’m studying. I’ve yet to mention it, but my job is just a part time thing, I’m a student outside of it. Proudly studying in one of the City’s many Universities. A couple years ago I studied microbiology, and while I wasn’t terrible at it, it wasn’t particularly my cup of tea, so I switched universities and now I’m in a social media program. Alright, with that bit of personal character building out of the way, the metro is almost at my station, time to get going.



As I step off the metro, the sudden rush of lights and movement from the City’s bustling underground hits me. It’s not an unpleasant feeling. The lights dance around in a myriad of purples and oranges, and the shifting shadows of the many walkers, quietly shuffling through the tunnels to wherever they’re going, creates a sort of natural light show. The underground is a place of many wonders, its long winding corridors of red bricks and seemingly endless shops make for fun exploration, not that many of the citizens ever bother to. I don’t either, given that if I do I’ll be late to class. Following the route I already know, one underground makes way for another, as I enter into the underground part of this university. I’ve always wondered why the City has such a large subterranean network, and rumours seem to say it’s been here longer than anyone remembers, and that the Pope himself would have blessed the first underground train line.

 I still don’t know why, but I can’t say I disapprove of it. Having a large network connecting pretty much the whole city without the hurdles of cars and red lights is a pedestrian’s dream. Now as for why the universities themselves are partly buried, that’s something I have no explanation for. But again, it’s pretty convenient being able to go from one faculty to the other without ever going outside. 



I’m the first one to arrive at this class. Nothing surprising there. I simply find a comfortable spot next to a wall I can lean on and take the time to plug in my laptop and tablet to easily take notes from the lecturer’s speech. Looking outside the windows, the fog is quite thick today, some of the buildings having been almost completely devoured. I sign a silent prayer to anyone who would’ve been working there, and remind myself to write an entry about the fog, another day. 



Time stretches slowly. Students come in and take their place one by one, barely exchanging glances, let alone words. The lecturer, of course, is late. And banging on the classroom door roaring “INVITE ME IN YOU LITTLE GREMLINS, ANY MATERIAL YOU MAKE ME MISS TODAY WILL BE POINTS YOU WON’T HAVE ON THE EXAM”. The door, of course, is unlocked.



 The class looks at each other, though some don’t even seem to notice the commotion, too absorbed into whatever they’re doing, which I doubt is related to this class. I’ve already had to sign a classwide contract of binding evaluation last week so I definitely won’t be volunteering today, I tell myself.



 Finally, a scrawny looking guy gets up and goes to the door “Erm, you are formally invited to lecture us for this class and provide us with the reading material sir…?” he quickly says, looking at all of us and gulping while doing it. I personally think he’s done okay, but I’m no expert on the matter so I hope for his sake that he did. 



The teacher is in a really foul mood. This was to be expected with how late he was. There’s so much material to cover each class that any minute missed is almost a slide’s worth of information he can’t cover. And so today he angrily, shakily, quickly goes over each slide, a torrent of spit leaving his mouth each sentence, and the veins on his large bald head looking as though they’re about to explode. I scramble to keep writing down any of his incoherent, way too drawn-out sentences, my white metal pen making strides across the surface of my tablet.



The rest of the class isn’t all too eventful, just more of the same. At the end of the class, the teacher finally catches his breath, taking one long, powerful inhale, almost thirty seconds deep, then looks at each of us expectantly, an uncanny glare in his stare. The student who invited him, some three hours ago, stands up again and loudly, though shakily, declares “We formally thank you for teaching us today, may you give us another prosperous lesson next week.” 



I’m impressed, the guy must’ve spent part of the class researching the proper phrasing since he knew he’d have to do the farewell. The teacher looks back at him, a mix of respect and disappointment in his eyes, and wordlessly leaves. The pressure in the room drops, almost magically, and anyone looking close enough could notice every student relaxing in their own way. For me, I open the drawing app on my tablet and start doodling a sunset over waves for a couple minutes before making my way out of the classroom.

  


Back in the bricky underground of the university, I cross multiple buildings to arrive at the Grand Library. I don’t have any more classes today, but I believe it’s important to study for at least a couple hours each day to stay on top, and what better place for it than the Grand Library. I’ve always loved libraries, ever since I was a kid living in a ridiculously small countryside village in the mountains, with a library of only three rooms, it’s been one of my favourite places to hole up in and simply have me time, whether it’s to read, study, draw, or simply chill, I believe libraries have this aura of peace and quiet to them that no other place on Earth quite has for me.

  


You can then imagine my utter awe when I first stepped foot in the Grand Library. The sheer size of it, the absolute luxury of it all. It honestly made no sense to me back then, in the best way possible, how books were travelling across the whole place on conveyor belts and could just be grabbed or put there by anyone, how there were shiny copper pneumatic tubes with books going up and down floors, how the stacks seemed to reach impossibly high and lay farther than my eyes could see, how despite there being maps and signs, I seemed to always find new floors and sections I’d never seen before. I think it was truly a moment of pure dogmatic adoration for me back then.

  
  
  
  


I sit down at a spot I’d never been to before, at one of the library’s few extremities, a large seat in front of a wall wide window that stretches endlessly to my left and right, giving me a bird eye’s view of the city in front of me. Given the fog today I don’t see quite far, but it’s breathtaking regardless. Grabbing the reading material for tomorrow’s class, I softly drift into the library’s “flow state”, where nothing is real other than right now. 

Not much happens today after that, I take the train to the closest station to home, walking the rest of the way through the groves and gardens of the P██  ███ll, the neighborhood I live in. My next work day is this Friday, so you’ll hear from me again soon.",1,1763761368.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

1p3b97m,https://www.reddit.com/r/SmallBusinessCanada/comments/1p3b97m/bc_im_building_a_small_online_coffee_store_in/,[BC] I’m building a small online coffee store in Vancouver. How did you find mentors or cofounders?,"Hi everyone,

I am a solo founder in Vancouver working on a small specialty coffee brand. It is an online, multi roaster store for premium whole bean coffee, mostly lighter roasts. I want to work with small, quality focused roasters and help both experienced coffee enthusiasts and more casual coffee lovers get really good coffee.

My background is in project management and operations in beverage production. I do not have a professional coffee background, but I have been a serious coffee hobbyist for the last 5-6 years. I am good at planning and execution, but I get stuck on branding, content, and putting myself out there. I am bootstrapping, so I am very careful with money. My biggest fear is buying coffee I cannot sell in time and watching it go stale.

I moved to Canada a while ago with my partner, so I do not have a huge social circle yet and right now it is just me. I have the concept, a registered name, a logo, website domain, bank account, business licence, and a friend helping with the website on the side. I know what I'm doing, and some days I feel excited and hopeful. Other days it feels too slow and hard to move forward.

I would really love to hear from people who have been through something similar. How did you find a mentor you actually trusted and listened to? Was it through your existing network, local events, online communities, cold messages, or something else? What did your first ask look like?

I am also unsure about the cofounder question. Having a cofounder with skills that complement mine would be a huge win, but finding someone with a similar mindset who is willing to take basic risks feels quite challenging. How did you decide you truly needed a cofounder and not just freelancers or a good mentor? Did you start small with a trial project before talking about equity, or jump in right away? Any big lessons or red flags you wish someone had told you earlier?

If you were in my situation, would you focus on finding one solid mentor and stay solo for now, start actively looking for a cofounder, or just launch as lean as possible first and worry about partners later?

I know nobody can decide this for me, but real experiences or advice would mean a lot.

1p3b5md,https://www.reddit.com/r/BudTrendz/comments/1p3b5md/hot_canadian_cannabis_products_for_the_weekend_of/,"Hot Canadian Cannabis Products for the Weekend of November 21, 2025","Thanks for joining us for this week’s list. This weekend brings a surprising shakeup: **Broken Coast** has taken the #1 spot — something that doesn’t happen often — while other familiar heavy hitters like Frost, Tenzo, and West Coast Gas continue their strong momentum. As always, the data is sourced from scraping six of the most active Canadian cannabis subreddits and analyzing the posts with AI to extract sentiment.

Upvotes, downvotes, and comments are combined into a *trend score* — our measurement of how much attention a product is receiving. The brands here earned their spot due to **both** positive and negative sentiment. A brand can be trending because people love the product or because they’re calling out issues, and that’s why we use:

* **🔥 for positive sentiment**
* **💩 for negative sentiment**
* **🔄 for neutral sentiment**

We total the trend score by brand and display them on Bud Trendz so you can see what’s hot in any four-hour period. This list repeats every week. Below, you’ll see each brand’s current sentiment (e.g., a brand with a 🔥 and a 💩 is receiving mixed reviews, while four 🔥 means consumers are loving it).

Let’s get into this week’s top 10.

# 1. Broken Coast 🔥 81

**Trending Products: 1 | Reviewers: 1 | Sentiment Summary:** Broken Coast claims the top spot this week — a rare sight — powered by a strong, detailed positive review of Coffee Creamer. With one 🔥 and one neutral rating, the sentiment leans positive, and consumers are clearly responding to this drop.

**Coffee Creamer – Broken Coast**

*Reviewer:* u/DokeyOakey

\[10\] The reviewer loved this one, highlighting its unique flavour profile and a high that’s clear headed, euphoric, and relaxing. They praised the dense buds, the even cure, and the shifting aroma from coffee and pepper to creamy vanilla and lemon when ground. The taste reminded them of a medium-body coffee, and the long-lasting high gently led into sleep after about 30 minutes.

# 2. Frost 🔥 73

**Trending Products: 1 | Reviewers: 1 | Sentiment Summary:** Frost lands in the #2 spot again this week, following strong performance last week. With a single 🔥 and no negatives, they’re trending entirely on positive sentiment.

**Frosted Fruit Cake – Frost**

*Reviewer:* u/p1ngmantoo

\[9\] The reviewer is really enjoying this one, describing a potent, flavourful smoke with creamy fruity dessert notes over a fuely, chemmy base. They noted a relaxing couchlock effect without being overwhelmed and called it a *home run* — especially after mixed experiences with Frost in the past.

# 3. Tenzo 🔥🔥🔥💩 71

**Trending Products: 4 | Reviewers: 4 | Sentiment Summary:** Tenzo returns for the second week in a row, again high on the list with *four* products trending. They have three positive 🔥 reviews and one 💩 for their pre-rolls, giving them a mixed but mostly positive week.

**Big Smallz – High Society – Tenzo**

*Reviewer:* u/heisenbrod

\[10\] Described as a “banger,” this product impressed with its great taste, strong scent, and overall quality. The reviewer highly recommends it and considers it worth the buy.

**Frozen White Runtz – Tenzo**

*Reviewer:* u/Darkryxx

\[8\] The reviewer thought the flower looked lovely even if they struggled to articulate more about the experience.

**Red Velvet – Tenzo**

*Reviewer:* u/baked_baddie

\[10\] Extremely fresh, sticky, and tasty with potent effects — this one was called a great value and strongly recommended.

**Bacio G33 Hemp & Kief Pre-Roll – Tenzo**

*Reviewer:* u/Awkward-Will-8824

\[4\] The only negative review among Tenzo’s entries this week. The reviewer disliked the added terpenes, found the smoke rough, and felt overstimulated by the effects. They also criticized the packaging for lacking key information.

# 4. West Coast Gas 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 58

**Trending Products: 2 | Reviewers: 2 | Sentiment Summary:** West Coast Gas comes in hot at #4, riding *five* positive crossposted reviews from two different reviewers. This is one of the strongest sentiment profiles of the week, with consumers consistently praising the old-school potency and flavour.

**Old School Fuel / Master Kush Ultra – West Coast Gas**

*Reviewer:* u/Upstairs-Tea-1769

\[9\] Across three posts, the reviewer repeatedly praised the loud Kushy and diesel nose, potent sedating effects, and smooth burn. They describe the high as blissful and calming with excellent value for the price, consistently scoring it 9.5/10.

**Heavy Hitters (GMO x MKU) – West Coast Gas**

*Reviewer:* u/Iscanet

\[9\] Two identical posts — one on OCS, one on BCCS — praised the smooth, hard-hitting experience, solid moisture level, and compact frosty buds. The reviewer loved the GMO energy with a twist and felt the product was worth the price, especially with a staff discount.

# 5. Sixty Seven Sins 🔥🔥🔥🔥 56

**Trending Products: 2 | Reviewers: 2 | Sentiment Summary:** Sixty Seven Sins stays a regular on the list, powered by four positive 🔥 reviews and no negatives. Consumers like what they’re smoking, though there’s feedback that the brand should diversify its offerings.

**Expo67 (Kush Sorbet) – Sixty Seven Sins**

*Reviewer:* u/Kaizan2323

\[9\] The reviewer praised the unique flavour, mind clarity, and relaxed body feel. They loved the all-day suitability with minimal burnout and appreciated the packaging, though they suggested adding a window or jar.

**Canadian Chill (High Alert) Pre-Rolls – Sixty Seven Sins**

*Reviewer:* u/Awkward-Will-8824

\[7\] Across three identical posts, the reviewer found these pre-rolls smooth and pleasant with decent aroma and effects. The profile was described as familiar and somewhat common, and they’re hoping to see more creativity from the brand in the future.

# 6. Simply Bare 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔄🔥🔥 55

**Trending Products: 1 | Reviewers: 2 | Sentiment Summary:** Simply Bare shows up with a ton of crossposts this week — mostly positive — though one neutral rating brings their sentiment to a blend of 🔥 and 🔄. Consumers consistently highlight the quality and attention to detail in this recurring favourite.

**BC Organic Fruit Loopz – Simply Bare**

*Reviewer:* u/PeteWK67

\[10\] The reviewer repeatedly praised the potency, flavour, organic growing methods, and strong effects. They highlighted the sweet and fruity flavour profile, rapid onset, long duration, and high terpene quality, calling it a top-tier product.

**BC Fruit Loopz Biologique – Simply Bare**

*Reviewer:* u/Extra_Ad6930

\[8\] This reviewer enjoyed the sweet, fruity, tangy profile and praised the freshness and quality, though found it a bit pricey.

# 7. Redecan 💩 46

**Trending Products: 1 | Reviewers: 1 | Sentiment Summary:** Redecan appears this week, unfortunately for the wrong reasons. With a single 💩 review, they’re trending due to overwhelmingly negative sentiment.

**Animal Rntz – Redecan**

*Reviewer:* u/the4thcoathanger

\[0\] The reviewer had a very poor experience, calling this the worst batch they’ve bought from OCS. They complained about the lack of smell, taste, and high, plus a dry, poorly trimmed product. They were surprised at the low quality given past positive experiences with the brand.

# 8. Cannafrogs 🔥 46

**Trending Products: 1 | Reviewers: 1 | Sentiment Summary:** Cannafrogs shows up again on the list this month with a single but strong 🔥 review. Consumers are enjoying what they’re producing.

**Fruitloops and Fuel – Cannafrogs**

*Reviewer:* u/The-dopechaud

\[9\] The reviewer enjoyed the complex scent and taste, describing a cerebral start that fades into a relaxing couchlock. They compare it favourably to a similar product from LOT420 and say it’s a definite rebuy.

# 9. The Loud Plug 💩 24

**Trending Products: 1 | Reviewers: 1 | Sentiment Summary:** The Loud Plug makes the list due to negative sentiment this week, receiving a single 💩 for their Tropicana Cookies.

**Tropicana Cookies – The Loud Plug**

*Reviewer:* u/Prohibition1923

\[4\] The reviewer was disappointed, citing a muted flavour and scent compared to past experiences with the same strain. The high didn’t stand out, and although the nugs looked good, they rated it only 4/10.

# 10. Le Malin Vert 🔥 24

**Trending Products: 1 | Reviewers: 1 | Sentiment Summary:** Le Malin Vert rounds out the list with a positive review and a strong value-for-price impression.

**Alien Kush AAA – Le Malin Vert**

*Reviewer:* u/ovoKOS7

\[8\] The reviewer thinks this product is seriously underrated for the price. They appreciate that it’s micro-grown in Sutton and feel the quality exceeds expectations.

Whether you’re stocking up for the weekend or planning your next dispensary run, this week’s data gives you a clear sense of what’s actually connecting with Canadian consumers right now. From standout flower that delivers consistency week after week to newer brands making unexpected jumps based on strong reviewer sentiment, the market continues to reward quality and transparency. 

Use these insights to guide your purchases, try something new, or double down on a favourite that’s earning real praise. And as always, the more people share their experiences, the sharper and more useful this list becomes.

The supermarket sells local fish and shockingly expensive mainland food.

The major industry here is coffee. I've included a photo of my coffee farm (at least one little piece of it.)

We're also known for having one of the best snorkeling bays in the world -- Kealakekua Bay. That's where Captain James Cook was killed (and subsequently boiled) by Hawaiians after being caught trying to kidnap the ruling chief of Hawaii Island. (There was no king at that time.)

I am a solo founder in Vancouver working on a small specialty coffee brand. It is an online, multi roaster store for premium whole bean coffee, mostly lighter roasts. I want to work with small, quality focused roasters and help both experienced coffee enthusiasts and more casual coffee lovers get really good coffee.

My background is in project management and operations in beverage production. I do not have a professional coffee background, but I have been a serious coffee hobbyist for the last 5-6 years. I am good at planning and execution, but I get stuck on branding, content, and putting myself out there. I am bootstrapping, so I am very careful with money. My biggest fear is buying coffee I cannot sell in time and watching it go stale.

I moved to Canada a while ago with my partner, so I do not have a huge social circle yet and right now it is just me. I have the concept, a registered name, a logo, website domain, bank account, business licence, and a friend helping with the website on the side. I know what I'm doing, and some days I feel excited and hopeful. Other days it feels too slow and hard to move forward.

I would really love to hear from people who have been through something similar. How did you find a mentor you actually trusted and listened to? Was it through your existing network, local events, online communities, cold messages, or something else? What did your first ask look like?

I am also unsure about the cofounder question. Having a cofounder with skills that complement mine would be a huge win, but finding someone with a similar mindset who is willing to take basic risks feels quite challenging. How did you decide you truly needed a cofounder and not just freelancers or a good mentor? Did you start small with a trial project before talking about equity, or jump in right away? Any big lessons or red flags you wish someone had told you earlier?

If you were in my situation, would you focus on finding one solid mentor and stay solo for now, start actively looking for a cofounder, or just launch as lean as possible first and worry about partners later?

I know nobody can decide this for me, but real experiences or advice would mean a lot.

So about 8 years ago, in my mid 30s the girls in question were 18 new to the city as university students. I was waiting to get into a bar after work. It was raining lightly and I had my big umbrella open, and while waiting it started raining heavily. So I heard voices behind me of girls whinging at each other for forgetting the umbrella.I turn around and see 2 girls together. I asked them if they wanted to get underneath the umbrella, which they politely accepted, and then continued to bicker. As this was making a little bit uncomfortable, I said to them - sisters shouldn't fight, difficult to be sure how heavily it would rain, good thing I was here - on my part they looked very alike. One of the girls replied - in an annoyed tone, we're not sisters. I apologised, then the other smacked the other one's arm, and scolded her - don't be rude, at least he was being a gentleman, first girl then said sorry, second girl then says to me - we're gfs, it's something new for us both. I replied, that's cool, I didn't mean to cause offence, you lookes similar to me. Then we got to chatting and getting familiar about each other.Once we got in, I said to them, enjoy your evening and we separated. I saw them again about an hour later at the bar, and they came over to me and asked me what I was drinking, they wanted to get me a drink as a thank you. I politely declined, explaining I am getting a few drinks and I only offered the umbrella because I was just doing the right thing, and as I am going to get drinks before them, they should tell me what they would like. There was a back and forth around that and I encouraged them to tell me their drinks. Did the order, told them have a good evening, and I went back to my group.Saw them again as I was leaving, they asked for my number, as they wanted to thank me properly at a later date. I thought nothing of it, being a man and accepting nothing was going to happen as they're gfs and also openly explaining that I am married while waiting in the queue, I gave them my number.The girls setup a group chat so the 3 of us could chat. Slowly they got flirty with me and the chat got sexual and also more open, at this point they never been with a guy sexually only ever kissed . About 6 months in to that friendship, they asked if I could help put a cupboard up. I arranged to go over after work one of the evenings, after helping them, I was having a coffee, they started to make out with each other as a thank you. This slowly escalated to them getting naked and performing sex acts with each other, while also watching me stroke my cock to them. This went on for about 3 months, usually twice a week. Then they asked me if I could not cum for a week, and also if I would be comfortable with touching my cock, I told them yes.
On that night, they had bought lube, they explored stroking my cock, giving me a bj, while also making each other cum. I didn't cum with them that night, though I did jerk myself off in front of them. The following week, same again and this time more confident and improved in what they were doing with me and asked to cum on their hands so they could feel and play with it. Things slowly escalated over about 6 weeks, I did cum over their tits, arses, faces, in their mouths and eventually they tried swallowing too. They also had me eat their pussy and finger them and use toys on them.
About 2 months later, they asked if they could use my cock to fuck. I of course said yes, so I took a few condoms with me, which I don't like using at all and I was open about that with them too, so they practiced putting that on my cock that first night for a bit and seeing what they were comfortable with doing, non-penetrative with their hands and mouth. Then they decided to try and use my cock to fuck, they were both too tight and couldn't get my cock in them. I suggested to them, they grind on my cock slowly instead, to help them get relaxed and used to the sensations they were feeling.
For the next several weeks, they did that on my bare cock while one of them either stood over me while getting eaten out by the other girl or sat on my face and let me eat them out while making out with each other. Eventually, after weeks of trying, they both were able to get my cock into their pussy. Initially not for very long, as it was painful for them and I was thankful, because they were not on birth control, as far as I know, and I was really struggling not to cum because of tight they both are.
After a few weeks, one of them was able to fuck me just long enough until I cum in the pussy though not balls deep, then the other one spent time her up with her mouth. Another 3 or 4 weeks later the other girl was able to do the same. Eventually they were both able to take my cock wholly. 
This went on for several years, where it was always them both, then eventually they also included a few other thing girls occasionally, it was always a no condoms date. Last few years, we're still friends, and I do still see them, not always sexually, but they do enjoy fun with me occasionally.

1p3az52,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSpreadContent/comments/1p3az52/why_short_sleeve_polo_shirts_are_the_most/,Why Short Sleeve Polo Shirts Are the Most Versatile Men’s Apparel Piece,"There’s one item that consistently holds a permanent spot in every man’s wardrobe — the short sleeve polo shirt. Whether you’re dressing for a casual brunch, a spontaneous golf round, or even a smart-casual Friday at work, polos always manage to strike the right balance between laid-back and refined. They carry a timeless design, effortlessly blending comfort with a touch of class.

One of the best things about short sleeve polos is their adaptability. Throw one on with jeans and sneakers for an everyday casual look, or tuck it into chinos with loafers and you’re instantly stepping into smart-casual territory. Their structured collar elevates them just enough to be taken seriously in semi-formal settings, yet their breathable fabric and short sleeves keep things cool and relaxed. This balance makes polos the ultimate transitional piece — perfect from morning coffee runs to late evening social gatherings.

Let’s talk versatility. A short sleeve polo works just as well on the golf course as it does at a summer BBQ. It bridges the gap between sporty and polished like no other garment. You can easily layer it under a blazer for a night out or pair it with shorts for a weekend beach trip. Unlike standard T-shirts, which can look too relaxed, polos provide a sense of effort and style — even when you’ve just thrown one on in a rush.

**Short sleeve polo shirts** are also incredibly flattering. The tailored fit hugs the shoulders and chest just right, offering a clean silhouette without clinging too tightly. Plus, the variety of colors and subtle patterns available means there’s a polo for every style and personality. From classic neutral tones to bold summer hues, they let you express yourself while keeping things sharp.

In a world where fashion is constantly evolving, the short sleeve polo remains a staple — never going out of style, always fitting in. If there’s one piece that should be in every man’s closet (in multiple colors), this is it. It’s not just about looking good; it’s about feeling good, knowing you’re ready for whatever the day throws at you.",1,1763760643.0,TheSpreadContent,0,1.0,False

I am a solo founder in Vancouver working on a small specialty coffee brand. It is an online, multi roaster store for premium whole bean coffee, mostly lighter roasts. I want to work with small, quality focused roasters and help both experienced coffee enthusiasts and more casual coffee lovers get really good coffee.

My background is in project management and operations in beverage production. I do not have a professional coffee background, but I have been a serious coffee hobbyist for the last 5-6 years. I am good at planning and execution, but I get stuck on branding, content, and putting myself out there. I am bootstrapping, so I am very careful with money. My biggest fear is buying coffee I cannot sell in time and watching it go stale.

I moved to Canada a while ago with my partner, so I do not have a huge social circle yet and right now it is just me. I have the concept, a registered name, a logo, website domain, bank account, business licence, and a friend helping with the website on the side. I know what I'm doing, and some days I feel excited and hopeful. Other days it feels too slow and hard to move forward.

I would really love to hear from people who have been through something similar. How did you find a mentor you actually trusted and listened to? Was it through your existing network, local events, online communities, cold messages, or something else? What did your first ask look like?

I am also unsure about the cofounder question. Having a cofounder with skills that complement mine would be a huge win, but finding someone with a similar mindset who is willing to take basic risks feels quite challenging. How did you decide you truly needed a cofounder and not just freelancers or a good mentor? Did you start small with a trial project before talking about equity, or jump in right away? Any big lessons or red flags you wish someone had told you earlier?

If you were in my situation, would you focus on finding one solid mentor and stay solo for now, start actively looking for a cofounder, or just launch as lean as possible first and worry about partners later?

I know nobody can decide this for me, but real experiences or advice would mean a lot.

For my entire life i've never seen my parents hug. Genuinely, I have never - ever seen them hug and I'm 15 by the way. The only one or two times they may have hugged was awkwardly when exchanging gifts or something and it would've been the most unnatural forced hug ever. They don't even like each other at all. Not even as friends they can't even be friends, they're not alike. I've never EVER seen them kiss, never seen them dance romantically and my mum admitted to me they haven't... 'done anything' since me.

for background information they had a somewhat 'love'-come-arranged marriage. my mum dated i supposed a lot of men but nothing so serious before marriage as far as i know. she married my dad in her mid thirties and my dad was in his late thirties then and he never had a relationship before that because he saw no need to. anyway, we've constantly had problems at homes too and a bit of financial instability. i'd always consider myself poor as a kid even though i wasn't really and this caused my mum to get frustrated at my dad for not making any efforts to change this and when there was a dispute over covid between my mum and my grandparents, her in laws, she really resented my father 

when my sister and i were 9 and 6 I guess things between them were getting particularly difficult and we were sent to our grandparents over the summer for a 'vacation' (our dad was staying with us while my mum went abroad. ) I now know that was odd but i was only 6 at the time so of course I thought nothing of it even thought it was fun. Now i know that during that period of time we were staying with our grandparents so our parents could have marriage counselling to sort things out i guess... my mum told me (only recently ofc) that it didnt go well - that's clear and that they didn't sort anything out. i also guess the therapist suggested intimacy exercises or something like that but i know that didnt work out either. for a time when my sister and i were 10 and 7 they were being close for no evident reason and giving each other nicknames and it looked so forced my sister and i would exchange glances of confusion... 

multiple times my mum has argued with my dad about divorce (we are religious so this won't happen apart from cases of cheating or something but that won't happen) and also about the argument over covid i mentioned earlier . my dad doesnt say anything sometimes he just leaves to go out for walks. it doesn't happen as often because my sister has gone to uni now. so it's just me and my parents. that brings me on to my other point. for the first 8 years of my life i slept in the same bed as my dad (the financial problems..) as we only had 2 bedrooms in a tiny flat and i was very young and the only other option was sleeping with my sister which couldnt happen either, a 3 year old and a baby . so that happened , until i was 8 ... gosh now that i think about it that was not long ago... and we moved out and i shared a room with my sister - until i was 13. I began to have a very bad relationship with my sister. I found myself sleeping on the sofa to stop being around her and of course that wasn't good so my father began sleeping on the sofa so i could sleep in my mums bed ... and.. this happened for the next two years (only a month ago this stopped) until my sister moved out and i moved back into 'our' room. every night for two whole years he would lay out his 'bed' laying the duvets and would sleep there on the sofa while we watched tv on the beanbags next to it. it was bad and i felt sick looking at it initially but then it just became normal and i hated how he treated it as normal when it so wasn't. 

when i came back to my room though he didn't immediately transition back to sleeping next to my mum like i thought would happen. it was as if there was no point sleeping next to his wife when there was a space ON THE SOFA by himself to sleep. my mum didn't say anything either and when i mentioned it they made excuses like 'oh but he snores' 'the room is too cold' 'the duvet is hot' 'i prefer sleeping in your bed'. okay youre married youre supposed to WANT to sleep NEXT to each other... and when she would sleep there sometimes the next night she would come and sleep with me and its just the whole circle starting again just because essentially they have no reason to sleep next to each other.

worse still i don't even know if they have conversations. i suppose occasionally they might but, they are so lonely. they both sit on their phone / laptop all day. and it's the same all. day. my dad gets up, makes my breakfast, i leave the house for school and he's (probably) on his computer all day. my mum often sleeps a little until i leave, most likely gets up, cleans, cooks, goes on phone, watches tv and then i get home and she talks to me. the only interaction they have is maybe asking one another if they want a coffee or tea. what made me tear up once was my mum telling me i gave her the love she never gets and that made me really good, but also as if there were a void in me too. Essentially, the only thing they have in common, is me.

worst of all they don't think about how this affects me. sure they aren't fighting everyday physically (and haven't ever) but they don't understand the psychological effects this will have on a child who has never been surrounded by parents in love. Luckily though i know this hasn't affected me although i did grow up thinking it was very normal for your parents not to be romantic at all to each other and thought it was taboo to see my friend's parents being lovey dovey. what has happened to me is instead is that i yearn for the love i never saw, instead of it shaping love into something hollow that doesn't have to be filled. at least, what i experience allows me to know exactly what i don't want to happen to me and i'd rather i know about it and it happens to me than it happening to my children. i'd hate for that to happen.",2,1763760397.0,teenagers,1,1.0,False

Year two: you've adjusted, you have routines, you're functional.

Year three: something shifts.

You realize you've stopped investing in friendships because you know they're temporary. Every ""let's get coffee sometime"" feels hollow because you've watched 10 people cycle through already. You're tired of being the new person, tired of explaining yourself, tired of shallow.

You notice you're performing. At work, in social situations, even at home, there's a gap between who you are and who you can be here. You're fluent in the language but you're not yourself. You're functioning but you're not thriving.

The homesickness changes. It's not ""I miss my favorite coffee shop"" anymore. It's ""I miss being understood without effort. I miss cultural shorthand. I miss being default instead of foreign.""

Your relationship with your partner is different. Maybe strained because the power imbalance (one of you is the local expert, one is dependent) created resentment nobody named. Maybe fine but flatter because they're your entire social world and that's too much weight for one person.

You start wondering: is this just life now? Am I just permanently 20% less happy than I was before? Did I make a mistake?

This is the phase where people either quit or commit. The ones who commit don't suddenly love it, they build sustainable rhythms that account for the reality that expat life is chronically harder than life in your home culture, even when it's good.

The ones who quit are definitely NOT failing, they're recognizing a fundamental mismatch and choosing differently.

Using FoodHealth Co.’s 1–100 scoring system (based on nutrient density + ingredient quality), the average U.S. household scored 48.9 almost 50% below the level tied to long-term health outcomes.

But here’s the surprising part:

Small weekly swaps = huge national gains.

If households replaced just *three* unhealthy items with healthier versions each week (think white bread → whole grain), the national score would rise +19 points.

Other takeaways:

• Some categories are getting healthier: soda, sour cream, juice, yogurt

• Others are going backward: RTD coffee, packaged fruit, baking mixes

• Brands prioritizing flavor/price over nutrition are “missing the market signal,” per the report

• Improving existing categories may offer more growth than inventing new ones

One of the most interesting insights?

SNAP is actually helping close health equity gaps.

Across the country, SNAP and non-SNAP households show nearly identical FoodHealth Scores and among households earning under $30K, SNAP users score 3–10% higher. Predictable access to food *improves* nutritional quality, despite political narratives claiming otherwise.

This comes as SNAP benefits face delays due to the government shutdown and recipients are being told to reapply amid claims of “widespread fraud.”

Don Callis tells Kyle and the world that this has been a long time coming, and that he is so proud of his champion. A lot of work has gone into this moment, and he wants Kyle to bask in this glory. But not everybody wants him to, and one man refuses to let him.

*Swerve Stricklands* music hits and the family turns their attention to the stage, but Swerve doesn’t come out, instead Prince Nana walks out, sipping on his coffee. Fletcher shakes his head and turns only to be hit with Swerve Stomp, from out of nowhere. Swerve returns from after being taken out at Revolution, and gets out of there before the family can get him.

Throughout the night the Don Callis Family make attempts to find and get Swerve but they are picked off one by one with sneak attacks. Swerve is on a mission. However he doesn’t get everyone, no Lance Archer is instead taken out by *”Hangman” Adam Page* who beats Swerve to the punch. He and Swerve stare off, before security arrive to get between them.

Thing’s get worse for Fletcher on next weeks Dynamite, as after Swerve Strickland is able to defeat Rocky Romero rather quickly, and the Don Callis Family surround the ring, *Konosuke Takeshita* makes his return to AEW. He hasn’t been seen since being ousted from the Don Callis Family, and runs down with a chair. Hangman also runs down and the three clear house and whilst Takeshita, Swerve and Hangman are in the ring, it is announced that the next week the brackets for both the men’s and women’s Owen Hart Foundation Cup Tournaments will be announced, and the three men in the ring are confirmed to be in the men’s tournament. Hangman then swings on Swerve who ducks and rolls out of the ring, and as Hangman stares him down, Takeshita turns him around and lays him out with a forearm.

The next week the brackets are confirmed, and in the first round Swerve Strickland will take on Josh Alexander, Hangman will take on Darby Allin and Konosuke Takeshita will take on the tournaments wild card. Claudio Castagnoli versus Kazuchika Okada rounds out the tournament, and takes place on this show with Okada winning.

The next week Swerve Strickland faces Josh Alexander, who works over Swerves leg, and after what had happened at Revolution, Swerve decides against using the Swerve Stomp and instead puts Alexander away with the JML Driver. 

On that same show Fletchers time in AEW continues to get worse, as *Mark Briscoe* who has been held hostage in the Don Callis Family for months, finally decides he has had enough and attack the champion, not caring if Don terminates his contract, he has had enough. 

The next week Fletcher and the family would make Briscoe pay for this, laying him out backstage on the same night that Hangman Buckshots his way to a victory over Darby Allin, who also took a Deadeye off the middle rope in this matchup. Briscoe on Collision tells the Don Callis Family that he is not done. 

Konosuke Takeshita then becomes the fourth semi-finalist, getting a well earned victory over Bandido on the following Dynamite, and he will take on Swerve next week in on semi final matchup, whilst Okada and Hanger fight in the other one. 

We hear from Hangman on this same Dynamite, who is on a mission to regain his championship, but if he is to get the finals and get a shot at the title, he may have to go through Swerve. He says he’s known this one was coming and he’s had time to think about this and, “Swerve said he is more than willing to go there to win the title…So I’ll go there too.”. Hangman is willing to bring out his darker side to get back his title, and is ready for the finals but first he has to get through Okada, which is no small task, with Okada being one of, if not the most successful tournament wrestlers ever.

Hanger versus Okada goes on first, and it is the battle of the lariats and who can hit theirs first. But as Okada has Hangman set up for the Rainmaker, Mark Briscoes music hits. He doesn’t come out but the distraction is good enough to allow Hanger to recover, hit a lariat on Okada before hitting the Buckshot to earn his place in the finals for the second year in a row at Double or Nothing. 

Later in the night Swerve and Takeshita battle to decide the second finalist, and both men put up fantastic fights, but in the end the man who has been after the World Title for months, and is seeking revenge, wins. Swerve catches Take with the House Call as he is running in for his big lariat, before planting him with the JML Driver for the victory, his knee still being an issue for him. After the match, Hangman Adam Page comes down the ramp to come face-to-face with Swerve, the next match in their series now confirmed for Double or Nothing.

For costing Okada his semi final match, Mark Briscoe is officially kicked out of the Don Callis Family, which is sort of good for him, but Don still has control of his contract. So on Collision he gives him a choice, he can either go home, collect his cheques, and provide for his family, or fight Kyle at Double or Nothing, where if he loses his contract will be cut, and he will not have a job anymore. Mark says there’s only one option he can take, and it’s the latter, and he will win, and if he doesn’t, then at least he went out the way he came in, fighting.

On the go-home Dynamite before DoN, Swerve and Hangman have a mediated in-ring confrontation, where the two go back and forth verbally before getting physical at the PPV. This is what Swerve Strickland had to say to his long time rival.

“Hangman many months ago now I told you that this was not your shootout…And it still isn’t. Your journey last year was beautiful and I am sure these people would love to see a repeat of it, but I’m unfortunately going to have deprave them of that. Two years ago I lost my AEW World Championship because of you, and then almost lost my career because of you. And though I have made peace with all that, it hasn’t left me, it hasn’t stopped fuelling me, and at Double or Nothing I will right those wrongs!”

Hangman would actually wish Swerve luck, and says that after years of bringing the worst out of each other, he now believes they’re bringing the best out of each other.

Mark Briscoe versus Kyle Fletcher for the AEW Championship is also made official for Double or Nothing, with Briscoe’s career on the line too.

The PPV is ended by that world title matchup but before then is the men’s Owen Hart Foundation Cup finale. Hangman and Swerve pick up right where they had left off, fighting with venom. There’s a buckshot, there’s a swerve stomp, Hangman counters the JML Driver, Swerve counters the Deadeye. It is back and forth till the end, where a broken and beaten Hangman takes too long to set up a Buckshot and as he rotates over the ropes he is caught with the Housecall. Swerve then hits the JML Driver and then heads up top to land the Swerve Stomp to win the matchup.

During Swerves celebration, being presented with the Owen Cup trophy on the ramp, Kyle Fletchers music hits. He walks past, as Prince Nana holds Swerve back, and gets ready for his first PPV AEW World Title defence. 

Mark Briscoe would give it his all against Fletcher but he has proven to be truly on another level since beating Swerve at Revolution, and after a low blow behind the referees back, a brain buster on the AEW World Championship, and a second brain buster from the top rope, Briscoe is put away, and cut from the company. Fletcher, worn out from the battle, rolls out of the ring without much celebration, inadvertently giving Mark the ring to receive standing ovation from the AEW faithful. 

But now we are here, the stage is set and Swerve Strickland will now challenge Kyle Fletcher for the AEW Championship in the main event of All In, AEW’s return to Wembley. 

On the first Dynamite after Double or Nothing we are shown footage from after the tournament finals where Hangman and Swerve shake hands backstage, with Hanger wishing Swerve luck. 

“It is your shoot out.”

Swerve has taken on the full force of the Don Callis Family before, and he is willing to do it again, but decides it would be in his best interests to enlist some help in the form of JetSpeed, the AEW Tagteam Champions, and in trios action in the build to All In Swerve pins the AEW World Champion, meaning Swerve has a lot of momentum going in to Wembley.

However on the go-home show to All In, JetSpeed and Swerve Strickland are laid out in a brutal beatdown by the family, and to close the show Kyle hits the brain buster through the table, which Swerve had just returned from taking, so though he proved he can beat Kyle, he is going in injured.

At All In Kyle is heavily booed by the crowd, who quite rightly hate this punk. They need Swerve to push through tonight and he does not plan to disappoint. 

Kyle works over the leg here again, and the neck, and shuts Swerve down at every turn. But Swerve fights back, and keeps fighting. The Don Callis Family interfere, but JetSpeed and Hangman Adam Page run down to counter them, and when Kyle gets the low blow, and his the two brainbusters, Swerve doesn’t go down and he kicks out. He would fire up and hit the JML Driver, but that wouldn’t out Kyle down. The two continue to go back and forth till Swerve is able to catch him with a House call. Kyle slowly gets back up and is hit with another, before being hoisted up for the JML Driver which is hit. Swerve then hits the Swerve Stomp before covering the champion and putting him away. 

Kyle rolls out of the ring, and Don stands over him disappointed, as Swerve is presented with the top prize that he had lost in this building two years prior. 

He holds it up high, back at the top of the mountain. ",2,1763760163.0,KYRBooking,0,1.0,False

I’m a mobile developer working in Switzerland (Zürich). I’m fully remote and I genuinely enjoy the technical side of my project, but the company culture and stability have become a serious problem.

Here’s the situation:

* I’m the only Android dev, and the only person I interact with daily is my manager (he works on iOS).
* He constantly talks badly about colleagues who left or were fired. I hear the same negative stories every day, which is mentally exhausting.
* He has already been involved in the dismissal of multiple people on the mobile team. He hired two junior devs, liked them at first, but later decided they were too slow or didn’t fit his coding style, and they were let go. Even our former manager ended up leaving after some conflict with him. This makes me feel like he has a lot of influence with upper management, and it wouldn’t be hard for him to get me fired as well.
* Last September, the company suddenly decided to shut down the mobile project and fired us. Two weeks later, they changed their mind as if nothing had happened.
* Recently they removed the 13th salary, removed overtime compensation, and replaced it with some “bonus based on delivery” (amount unknown). No salary increase, no clear direction.
* I’m constantly stressed, don’t have spare time anymore, and I even stopped going to the gym.
* I’d like to stay in Zürich long-term, but right now the mobile market looks bad and there are almost no local opportunities.
* I’m also scared of unemployment (RAV). I’ve heard stories about penalty days, mandatory courses, bureaucracy, and I worry that as an expat with no German I’ll get the worst treatment.
* What I really want is some time to learn new technologies and update my GitHub so I can widen my job opportunities (backend, AI, whatever), but I’m not sure RAV would let me do that.
* I considered sick leave due to burnout symptoms, but I’m unsure about the cost of seeing a psychiatrist and whether it’s worth going down that path.
* I even thought about starting a bar or coffee place, but I have no idea how risky that is or if I’d just lose money unnecessarily.

Right now I’m stuck between several options:  
• **Resign**  
• **Let them fire me / stop overperforming**  
• **Take sick leave**  
• **Try to survive until the market improves**  
• **Start a business**

For context, I’m a software engineer with 7+ years of experience, but mentally I feel like I’ve reached the bottom.

I’m a mobile developer working in Switzerland (Zürich). I’m fully remote and I genuinely enjoy the technical side of my project, but the company culture and stability have become a serious problem.

Here’s the situation:

* I’m the only Android dev, and the only person I interact with daily is my manager (he works on iOS).
* He constantly talks badly about colleagues who left or were fired. I hear the same negative stories every day, which is mentally exhausting.
* He has already been involved in the dismissal of multiple people on the mobile team. He hired two junior devs, liked them at first, but later decided they were too slow or didn’t fit his coding style, and they were let go. Even our former manager ended up leaving after some conflict with him. This makes me feel like he has a lot of influence with upper management, and it wouldn’t be hard for him to get me fired as well.
* Last September, the company suddenly decided to shut down the mobile project and fired us. Two weeks later, they changed their mind as if nothing had happened.
* Recently they removed the 13th salary, removed overtime compensation, and replaced it with some “bonus based on delivery” (amount unknown). No salary increase, no clear direction.
* I’m constantly stressed, don’t have spare time anymore, and I even stopped going to the gym.
* I’d like to stay in Zürich long-term, but right now the mobile market looks bad and there are almost no local opportunities.
* I’m also scared of unemployment (RAV). I’ve heard stories about penalty days, mandatory courses, bureaucracy, and I worry that as an expat with no German I’ll get the worst treatment.
* What I really want is some time to learn new technologies and update my GitHub so I can widen my job opportunities (backend, AI, whatever), but I’m not sure RAV would let me do that.
* I considered sick leave due to burnout symptoms, but I’m unsure about the cost of seeing a psychiatrist and whether it’s worth going down that path.
* I even thought about starting a bar or coffee place, but I have no idea how risky that is or if I’d just lose money unnecessarily.

Right now I’m stuck between several options:  
• **Resign**  
• **Let them fire me / stop overperforming**  
• **Take sick leave**  
• **Try to survive until the market improves**  
• **Start a business**

For context, I’m a software engineer with 7+ years of experience, but mentally I feel like I’ve reached the bottom.  
Any advice from people who know Swiss work culture, RAV, or the Zürich tech market would be extremely appreciated. Thanks.",7,1763760040.0,zurich,5,0.73,False

I go into work, get my coffee, majority of the day I'm sitting at my desk, I'll talk to fellow co workers (usually about work stuff and sometimes about life things but I don't like to go into much detail about my personal life because I am at work).

My boss asked me to plan this potluck lunch for work and so for a week thats what I did. We had a list of food who was gonna bring what, I went and bought supplies and decorations and I made sure that we had enough of everything for the potluck. The day(actually that afternoon) before the potluck my boss texted a co worker of mine (she has been dubbed the workplace bully but tbh I wouldn't know. The reason I stay at my desk is to stay away from the office drama) she texted her (co worker/workplace bully) to bring decorations and make sure that there is enough stuff for the potluck and when I went into work that morning with my decorations (and the two food dishes I made for the potluck) she was already there with her decorations and getting tables and chairs ready. 

Idk I just feel like I was little blindsided everyone knew I was planning the potluck and a few co workers told me if I needed them to do anything to let them know. I really just don't understand that if there was something I did that wasn't to someone's liking why wasn't it addressed? Why wasn't I told? I'm just very confused.

BUT as companies grow up, understandably their policies and processes change and so it was inevitable that we'd get the ""exciting news"" that we were ""moving to Expensify"" and would now need itemized receipts for every little thing, no matter how small the expense was. Understandable, a company needs better control over expenses, and better tracking of them.  I get it, I'm a manager and have been at this for quite some time. 

That said, the level of detail now needed is annoying and makes filing expense reports take easily three to four times longer than it used to. There have been some trips where I've spent half a day getting my own together because I tend to have a lot of expenses on a 1 - 2 week trip. ""You want me to itemize every little thing and provide individual line items for every tiny amount, you got it, Boss...""  So I am now quite petty about these and itemize everything, even purchases that amount to only a dollar or less.  Bus Ticket? Bought with an app, here's the receipt.  Bottle of water?  Here's the receipt.  Lunch? Bought a sandwich here, a cookie here, and a coffee here.  That's three line items for the same meal.  Done.

Today, I am reviewing expense reports for my team for our most recent trip and one of my newest team members, one who was not here for The Times Before, just made me so proud as a manager.  He noticed that Expensify's auto-conversion for foreign exchange was not the same as the rate his credit card used.  So he calculated the difference. For every single item on his report.  And added another line item for every single item on the report to reclaim the money where Expensify's conversion was lower than what his card changed.  One of these items is for $0.20 CAD.  Another for $0.17 CAD. His expense report is twice as big as it would have been otherwise and I can not being to adequately describe the pride I am feeling in him complying with the policy and providing a line item for every single thing, following the policy to the letter.  This is the kind of pettiness I encourage in my team and the giggles I'm getting from this are a great way to end the week.",624,1763759769.0,MaliciousCompliance,29,0.98,False

I’m hoping to connect with people who are into technology, software development, or anyone who is goal-oriented and likes improving themselves. Even just chatting online or meeting for a coffee would be nice.

1p3a9ct,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p3a9ct,"Wednesday and her mistake with the Machiavelli quote (Season 2, Episode 1)","

Wednesday has mentioned Machiavelli twice in the series. The first time was in season one, when Wednesday is with Tyler in Weathervane fixing a broken coffee maker, and the instructions are in Italian. Wednesday knows Italian and tells Tyler that it was Machiavelli's language.

In season two, episode one, Wednesday mentions Machiavelli again, this time to Enid, after Wednesday scares Ajax away from her at her request.

Wednesday's quote is:

***""Machiavelli once said that friendship is watching a person's slow drip of miseries and feeling honored to be present in their most dismal moments.""***

The problem?

It's not a quote from Machiavelli. It's from the book A Little Life by Hanya Yanagihara. ***“Friendship was witnessing another’s slow drip of miseries, and long bouts of boredom, and occasional triumphs. It was feeling honored by the privilege of being present for another person’s most dismal moments, and knowing that you could be dismal around him in return.”***

While Wednesday’s full quote isn’t exactly the same as the book’s, it is the same quote, and it wasn’t said by Machiavelli. But the most curious thing of all is that the book’s plot is entirely LGBTQ+.

Summary:

Main Queer Characters: Two of the four central friends, and in fact, the two characters on whom the plot focuses most, have relationships with men.

Jude St. Francis: The protagonist has romantic and deep love relationships with men, with the central relationship in his life (though not sexual due to trauma) being with his friend Willem.

JB: One of the four friends is openly gay and an artist.

Willem: The character of Willem, although not initially identifying as such, explores his orientation throughout the novel and has a romantic relationship with Jude.

However, the plot also has its share of controversy:

It's crucial to mention that, while the novel features queer characters and same-sex relationships, the book has generated debate within the LGBT community itself:

Focus on Suffering: Criticism sometimes focuses on the novel's use of the suffering and trauma (sexual abuse, self-harm, etc.) of its gay characters (especially Jude) as the main driving force of the plot, rather than focusing on the joy or simplicity of queer life. Some see it as a ""sensationalist"" or pain-focused portrayal.

Homosocial vs. Homosexual Relationships: The author also explores the love and intensity of male friendship (homosociality) that evolves into something more intimate (homosexuality), with this blend of love and dependence being a key theme.

God, just change the characters' genders and it's Wenclair!

I hope this isn't here yet, but my head is completely blown. Another easter egg for us.... it's insane.

I think the book's plot fits with Wenclair because there's also drama, like what happened in season two. With Enid losing her humanity to save Wednesday and running away in wolf form, it feels like the same dark premise without the self-harm. The interesting thing about this is that ""suffering"" is also very much interconnected with gothic love. ",23,1763758948.0,wenclair,18,1.0,False

But as soon as my eyes try to focus on them, they become formless lights again. I can feel the presence behind me, whispering eldritch truths. The problem with those is a normal dude like me can’t understand them. So I just tune out the unknowable speech until it’s nothing more than white noise as I gaze upon the lights slowly drifting above the abyss. I’ve been having this dream often recently, I realize. Not my first recurring oniric journey by far, but I’m more used to the “classroom shame” type, though even these ones get weird, like that one time I spat out hundreds of live eels and they started flying,.. but that’s neither here nor there. Gripping my thoughts tighter, I gaze down at the hungering abyss below the lights and feel a shudder pass, better to keep on the lights then. And so i drift and the lights keep gently soothing me and they dance and dance and dance and dance-



I wake with a jolt at my alarm, you know the one, the annoying Iphone one everyone has heard at least once and hates. I keep it because of that hate though, it’s what gets me to wake up to turn it off, it’s what fuels me to forge on ahead with my day, to prove the smug alarm wrong, that I do have my life together, even if it’s wishful thinking. Morning preparations pass in a blur, at some points routine becomes so numb you start doing them without realizing, like when I leave my room with the blinds open, and come back to them close, i just do it without realizing it. It’s 7:03 by the time I’m done, not my best time, but not my worst by far, I’ll be 30 minutes early today, but that’s nothing new. 



The ride on the metro always feels like a second dream, the darkness of the underground and the few dim lights on the tunnel walls blending to create this weird hazy atmosphere. The people all present in a small spot, doing nothing, yet somehow so far from each other, each one in their own little pocket of reality, barely aware of each other. Yet I watch them, not intently, no more than one sweep of my eyes per person, but that feeling of surveying the people as they are in their bubble in this public space that feels more private than many fills me with a confidence, a form of understanding of my own reality by watching others.



 Lost in thought, I almost miss my stop, but a well timed gaze of the wall shows me we’ve arrived, “The Weapons Palace”, always so ominous with the towering justice building leading to the port. As usual, it takes me 5 to 7 minutes to make my way from the palace down to the Old Port, a place of wonder and horror all the like. At least in the morning there aren't too many weird happenings, but I still take my precautions and avoid the dim lit alleys that appear invitingly as shortcuts. Sure it makes the trip longer, but it’s a cost I’m more than willing to pay after what happened last Summer. 



I suppose now’s as good a time as any to give a small explanation of my job and place of employment, as I sit on the ancient stone stairs and wait for my coworkers on my phone. I’m an intendant (a rather dull title that in actuality represents a whole lot of responsibilities) for the City’s best (and only easily accessible to the uncommon mortal or not) bike rental shop! Come on Mondays for 25% off! Don’t ask why, no, there’s nothing weird going on at the Island on Monday, just don’t go there okay. Alright, promotions aside, it’s a pretty amazing job, most of it is moving bikes from the front shop to our little plot of land on the port, and talking to customers, which are typically tourists from all over the world! Sometimes they’re from places I've never even heard about, and I had a history major in high school. 



So anyways, I’ll keep you guys posted with interesting stuff that happens at work during my breaks. There’s already quite a backlog of fun stories I want to share, so most of these will be in the past, but I'll still write them in the present for the sake of clarity. 

  


**CHAPTER 1: A HOT DAY AND WORKING IN THE BASEMENT**

The heat today might just kill me. That and the sounds from the Basement. Truly a pick your poison type of situation: scorch under the City’s strange sun that burns and summons rain at a moment’s notice with no clouds; or toil in the Basement and be subject to its sounds that feel like nails on a chalkboard, it’s many tripping hazards, it’s ceiling so low i have to be almost crouching, and that’s not to mention the unknown of its too many hallways and how it’s somehow way bigger than the building it’s sitting under. 



Well, there’s some small graces, I don’t have to make that choice today; Manager just told me I’ll have to do a bit of both today. 



As I walk back inside the smooth air conditioned interior of our shop, I spot today’s Manager leaning on the counter. He’s a brown haired, short and hunched, 30-something year old man, with a face full of faults; crooked teeth, long nose, uneven chin. And yet, he always has this air upon him that makes him striking. Shrinking back with dread (which is a comical image if you can picture that he’s almost half my height) I dare ask “Is the Owner here today?”. 



As the quickly stammered out words leave my lips before I can think better of it, the air itself seems to still, the entire store seems too quiet, even the usual clanking of the Mechanic’s workshop we typically hear faintly is eerily absent. The Manager turns his slightly crossed eyes to me, his uneven gaze managing to still be searing. He rasps under his breath “He won’t be here this week, but keep your tongue to yourself, boy.” and gives a pointed look to the general direction of the glinting of one of the many hidden cameras. 

I know they can’t detect sound, but a chill nonetheless passes through me despite the scalding heat outside at the idea that He could very well be watching right now. Deciding to try and move on, I ask “So, what are we guys to do with all that heat today”, “Well, he says, we aren’t getting customers for another half hour, so why don’t you guys grab extra bikes from under and bring them to our plot while I sort out our overdue paperwork?”.



 Knowing better than to ask for another assignment, I give a curt nod and make my way to the Basement, knowing damn well than despite there being 3 other intendants here with me today, I’ll have to be the one to go down there, “you’re the one who can weather it the best after all”, they’ll say.

So I grimly make my way through our store, first through our long customer service section with its gleaming metal counters and many maps of the shifting lanes of the City. Then through our products section where we keep a handful of bike products in the event of a non client needing them and walks by our store (happens more than you’d think). Then I pass in front of the workshop, making sure not to actually set foot in the place since today the one holding the shift is the old Hob faced one, and I’d find myself with a wrench thrown at me full force if I did get too close to the forges. 



Finally, after what feels like an eternity, I arrive at the very back of our store, where there’s old rusted lift to get heavy objects down into and from the basement, the little staircase that’s so narrow you can barely fit through it, and the employee room and kitchen to either sides of the instalment. I stop by to take a sip of coffee, a nice reminder of the cleverness of the Owner’s design for the shop; by placing the break room and kitchen right next to the Basement’s entrance, he’d ensured that we would only go there for our actual breaks or in cases of true need. Anyways, enough stalling. Setting one unsure foot on the first small wooden step of the staircase, I inhale deeply, then take the plunge.



The atmosphere in the basement always hits you in parts. First, there’s the strange, almost comforting, feel of stillness. You know the old attic at your grandparent’s place, with dim orange light going through the cracks in the roof, and dust particles being visible through the beams of light? It feels like that, even though there’s no luminous beams nor dust clouds. Yet there’s this feeling, this strange moment where you think everything has gone still, that the world itself is catching its breath, as you first enter the Basement.



 And then there’s the second part; mystery. Many things don’t make sense in this shop, Heck, many things don’t make sense in this City. But there’s something about the Basement that always strikes out when you enter, even if you’ve never been in it before. How it’s definitely bigger than the building that sits above it, despite all logic making you think you’d be under the river only a couple of steps into it. How there’s an unknown amount of hallways twisting out from the main shape of the place. How you can find seemingly anything you could be looking for, except water.



The third part is always the worst, the sound. It doesn’t necessarily happen right after the first two parts. Sometimes you spend tens of minutes in the Basement before it happens. Sometimes you do whatever you need to do and exit and it doesn’t even show up. But it always comes back, and you never expect it. Today it hit me mere seconds after getting my bearings in the dim lit environment. The loud, indescribable blaring that seems to come from all around you, and deep from your bones at the same time. I’ve heard people argue over what it is and what it sounds like a lot more than you’d think. To some, it is akin to being right next to one of those large cargo ships foghorn as it goes off. To others, they swear it’s the sound of a nuclear siren. The only thing we all agree on is that it rattles you to your very core whenever it catches you. And it does, always. And there’s the other half of the sound, the somehow even less sensible one; the images. The sheer brutality of the sound seems to every time, no matter what or who, fill the person’s head with images of flesh, of meat, of skin.



There are benefits to being sent here though. First is the most obvious; since no one else, not even the managers, wants to be here if they can help it, that usually means I’ll be nice and alone down here. And the lack of a camera means that working in the Basement is primo time to be on my phone and write more of this. Of course I need to keep an eye on the time to not be suspicious, but I’m used to that. The other, more subtle benefit, is the stillness I mentioned before. Of course this is dependent on the raking and clanking being absent, but even when it appears, it usually fades in a few minutes. To be more precise, being alone in the basement feels the same as what most people I imagine feel in their own bedrooms. A feeling of security and privacy, of being able to be truly yourself without anyone to judge. It’s nice.



So, phone in hand and writing more of this as I go, I advance further in the liminal space. Passing by many branching corridors I’ve never seen before, I try to stay focused on my goal. Which, writing this, now would be a good time as any to explain why I’m down here today in the first place. The manager earlier didn’t see fit to explain it, as it was quite obvious (to me). 



You see, on particularly hot days like these, we often run out of bikes in the front shop at midday at best. So my current goal is to locate some extra large men’s bikes, and small women’s bikes, as those two are the ones we run out of the fastest. Thankfully the basement appears to contain anything and everything you could be looking for, as long as it’s not water.



I reach the first threshold, a small door full of holes, with a red “EXIT” glowing sign above it. All the employees know it doesn’t actually lead to an exit, and the long, winding and dark corridor visible through the holes is hopefully hint enough for anyone who *doesn’t* know.

Thankfully, I spotted a large rack of bikes to my left. I don’t have to risk a threshold today after all. Peering at the bikes neatly arranged, I manage to locate two extra larges, and a small. Great, now to get them off. You have to understand that with the sheer amount of bikes we have, they have to be \*extremely\* tightly arranged if we are to hold them all in. 



Now, my best friend, who is working on buying the shop from The Owner (but that’s a whole other can of worms for another day) is keen on selling a ton of them to save space, but that’s neither here, nor there. 

Meaning i have to move approximately a dozen bikes just to get the three i’m looking for. Right. 

Well, you get used to it.



It’s been a bit. Climbing back onto the large rusted metal cargo elevator with the bikes in tow, I grab the bright yellow control remote, a stark contrast to the damp darkness of the basement. The thrum of machinery around me rattles as the contraption begins its slow ascent back to a more civilized world. It’s funny how in any other context in this city, underground is synonymous to security, to peace. 



But in this shop, it’s a dreaded concept. What I'm trying to say is the actual transit period between below and aboveground is easily my favourite thing about the Basement. It’s this sort of quiet, in between, moment (despite the clicking and clanking noise) where everything seems suspended. Nothing really matters, all I’m doing is pressing the remote and holding the bikes so they don’t fall off in the deep below. There’s a beauty to that, I believe.



Alright, now that I’ve done the work, it’s time to do the work. You might think I’m joking, or making a pun, but anyone who’s ever worked in retail will tell you there’s always something to do. No matter what. Honestly I think there might even be some twisted divine game to that. Anyways, to sound less cryptic it just means I need to actually sort the bikes now. Bringing them to the front of the store, I give a jolly little middle finger to the manager, who responds with two of his own. That’s one of the things I truly enjoy about this job, the lightness of the tone, it probably helps that my best friend since middle school works here too, though to do him justice I will try not to talk too much about him until I give him a whole chapter of his own.



Anyways, to the more pressing matter at hand, I make my way to the clients who were waiting for their bikes the whole time. I hand them the goods, apologizing in the way we retail workers do: “I’m so sorry that the thing out of my control made you have to wait longer”. I obviously don’t word it that way, but that’s how it is. 



The clients’ sort of opaque eyes seem unfocused, and they give me a very half-assed response in their broken English. They’re the annoying type who speak none of the City’s official languages, and barely hold their own in american english, so working with them feels almost like working as an interpreter too. I never know where they come from, their accent is unrecognizable, their face unremarkable, and their native language unknown. So I don't feel too bad about them having to wait, after all, I had to wait for them to understand our system and make proper requests.



The rest of the day after this was pretty empty, some new clients here and there, but nothing too different from anything I’ve described so far, so I think I’ll just end this chapter here. If you guys have any questions about my work or this City I’d love to try and tackle them in Chapter 2, in the meantime I’m working on an interlude that will cover a different piece of my story.

  
  


**INTERLUDE: IN A LIBRARY, STUDYING UNDERGROUND**



I’m not working today. This may come as a surprise to some of you “Oh, why is he writing about a day he didn’t work? Isn’t his whole story about his job?”. You would be right, to some extent. This story is front, right, and center about my job and its quirks, but the City itself is home to many more interesting things than just the one shop I work at, and so I intend to share some of this in these “Interlude” type chapters. Shorter, less story driven, pieces that add to the worldbuilding and serve as pieces while I work on Q&A. So, what is it about today? As the title implies, I’m studying. I’ve yet to mention it, but my job is just a part time thing, I’m a student outside of it. Proudly studying in one of the City’s many Universities. A couple years ago I studied microbiology, and while I wasn’t terrible at it, it wasn’t particularly my cup of tea, so I switched universities and now I’m in a social media program. Alright, with that bit of personal character building out of the way, the metro is almost at my station, time to get going.



As I step off the metro, the sudden rush of lights and movement from the City’s bustling underground hits me. It’s not an unpleasant feeling. The lights dance around in a myriad of purples and oranges, and the shifting shadows of the many walkers, quietly shuffling through the tunnels to wherever they’re going, creates a sort of natural light show. The underground is a place of many wonders, its long winding corridors of red bricks and seemingly endless shops make for fun exploration, not that many of the citizens ever bother to. I don’t either, given that if I do I’ll be late to class. Following the route I already know, one underground makes way for another, as I enter into the underground part of this university. I’ve always wondered why the City has such a large subterranean network, and rumours seem to say it’s been here longer than anyone remembers, and that the Pope himself would have blessed the first underground train line.

 I still don’t know why, but I can’t say I disapprove of it. Having a large network connecting pretty much the whole city without the hurdles of cars and red lights is a pedestrian’s dream. Now as for why the universities themselves are partly buried, that’s something I have no explanation for. But again, it’s pretty convenient being able to go from one faculty to the other without ever going outside. 



I’m the first one to arrive at this class. Nothing surprising there. I simply find a comfortable spot next to a wall I can lean on and take the time to plug in my laptop and tablet to easily take notes from the lecturer’s speech. Looking outside the windows, the fog is quite thick today, some of the buildings having been almost completely devoured. I sign a silent prayer to anyone who would’ve been working there, and remind myself to write an entry about the fog, another day. 



Time stretches slowly. Students come in and take their place one by one, barely exchanging glances, let alone words. The lecturer, of course, is late. And banging on the classroom door roaring “INVITE ME IN YOU LITTLE GREMLINS, ANY MATERIAL YOU MAKE ME MISS TODAY WILL BE POINTS YOU WON’T HAVE ON THE EXAM”. The door, of course, is unlocked.



 The class looks at each other, though some don’t even seem to notice the commotion, too absorbed into whatever they’re doing, which I doubt is related to this class. I’ve already had to sign a classwide contract of binding evaluation last week so I definitely won’t be volunteering today, I tell myself.



 Finally, a scrawny looking guy gets up and goes to the door “Erm, you are formally invited to lecture us for this class and provide us with the reading material sir…?” he quickly says, looking at all of us and gulping while doing it. I personally think he’s done okay, but I’m no expert on the matter so I hope for his sake that he did. 



The teacher is in a really foul mood. This was to be expected with how late he was. There’s so much material to cover each class that any minute missed is almost a slide’s worth of information he can’t cover. And so today he angrily, shakily, quickly goes over each slide, a torrent of spit leaving his mouth each sentence, and the veins on his large bald head looking as though they’re about to explode. I scramble to keep writing down any of his incoherent, way too drawn-out sentences, my white metal pen making strides across the surface of my tablet.



The rest of the class isn’t all too eventful, just more of the same. At the end of the class, the teacher finally catches his breath, taking one long, powerful inhale, almost thirty seconds deep, then looks at each of us expectantly, an uncanny glare in his stare. The student who invited him, some three hours ago, stands up again and loudly, though shakily, declares “We formally thank you for teaching us today, may you give us another prosperous lesson next week.” 



I’m impressed, the guy must’ve spent part of the class researching the proper phrasing since he knew he’d have to do the farewell. The teacher looks back at him, a mix of respect and disappointment in his eyes, and wordlessly leaves. The pressure in the room drops, almost magically, and anyone looking close enough could notice every student relaxing in their own way. For me, I open the drawing app on my tablet and start doodling a sunset over waves for a couple minutes before making my way out of the classroom.

  


Back in the bricky underground of the university, I cross multiple buildings to arrive at the Grand Library. I don’t have any more classes today, but I believe it’s important to study for at least a couple hours each day to stay on top, and what better place for it than the Grand Library. I’ve always loved libraries, ever since I was a kid living in a ridiculously small countryside village in the mountains, with a library of only three rooms, it’s been one of my favourite places to hole up in and simply have me time, whether it’s to read, study, draw, or simply chill, I believe libraries have this aura of peace and quiet to them that no other place on Earth quite has for me.

  


You can then imagine my utter awe when I first stepped foot in the Grand Library. The sheer size of it, the absolute luxury of it all. It honestly made no sense to me back then, in the best way possible, how books were travelling across the whole place on conveyor belts and could just be grabbed or put there by anyone, how there were shiny copper pneumatic tubes with books going up and down floors, how the stacks seemed to reach impossibly high and lay farther than my eyes could see, how despite there being maps and signs, I seemed to always find new floors and sections I’d never seen before. I think it was truly a moment of pure dogmatic adoration for me back then.

  
  
  
  


I sit down at a spot I’d never been to before, at one of the library’s few extremities, a large seat in front of a wall wide window that stretches endlessly to my left and right, giving me a bird eye’s view of the city in front of me. Given the fog today I don’t see quite far, but it’s breathtaking regardless. Grabbing the reading material for tomorrow’s class, I softly drift into the library’s “flow state”, where nothing is real other than right now. 

Not much happens today after that, I take the train to the closest station to home, walking the rest of the way through the groves and gardens of the P██  ███ll, the neighborhood I live in. My next work day is this Friday, so you’ll hear from me again soon.",1,1763758867.0,Viidith22,0,1.0,False

 anyways after 20 or 30 mins of small talk and silence she did in FACT gave me her phone number she did not ask me if i wanted it she just did she gave me her number and also wants to meet up for coffee, the problem is when we talked we both were curious to know how life was going and we both asked each other if we were married or single etc etc she said she was single and for some reason i lied and said the same thing??? And i'm currently dating a normal woman of my age (I'm in my 30s) Aaaaaand that's why I'm here is it wrong to lie about that? Not only her. but my girlfriend too? I didn't discussed any of this with my gf about my day. Hypothetically speaking if i were to meet this person i used to know many years ago just for coffee and that's it, is it morally ok??? oh and this might not be important but after we said goodbye she gave me a long hug and two kiss on the same cheek and said she's looking forward to see me again soon and to take care.
I'm vulnerable right now, is there a way i can go for that coffee and not feeling guilty i don't wanna gaslight myself?? i know i won't cheat?? i don't have it in me?? I have never cheated a woman before, i don't want to cheat... oh also she meant to meet each other in her apartment. 
do i. need. help? Is just a coffee right? what could go wrong with that? everybody likes coffee?

1p3a6j9,https://www.reddit.com/r/parkingguides/comments/1p3a6j9/parking_tips_for_xcoast_at_club_vinyl_denver_1122/,parking tips for x-coast at club vinyl (denver 11/22),"  
  
hey, figured i’d share some parking tips for x-coast at the basement this friday, 11/22. the broadway/capitol hill area is honestly a nightmare to park in when there’s a big show, especially later at night, so a little planning goes a long way.  
  
first thing’s first: ditch the street circling. seriously. people are always worried about the private lots right next to vinyl being sketchy or overpriced, which is fair. if you want to skip that whole mess and potentially get way closer, check out Prked. it's an app where people rent out their private driveways or garages near the venue. it's often a short walk, way cheaper than the day-of lots, and you skip the traffic bottleneck on broadway entirely by parking a block over. it’s the local insider move for these popular club nights.  
  
if you prefer a formal structure, your best bet is to pre-book a spot online using a service like spothero or parkchirp. this guarantees your spot and price, which helps a lot since they raise rates for big events. there are several good garages and lots within a short walk. look for the evans east lot (1120 acoma st) which can be as low as $7.99, or the chancery garage (1120 lincoln st) for around $8.99, both are quick walks. other nearby options are the 1065 lincoln lot and the art garage on 1200 lincoln. pre-booking will save you stress on a 10:00 pm start night.  
  
for the brave souls going the street parking route, head south down broadway or dive into the side streets 1 to 3 blocks away from the venue. lots of people report zero issues doing this for years. you can try the diagonal spots near 11th avenue by metropolis coffee or even further over towards santa fe if you don't mind a longer walk. just make sure you feed the meter correctly using the paybyphone app—denver is aggressive with tickets and you do not want one of those ridiculous private lot non-compliance fees. one big warning: avoid those temporary “cash only, twenty bucks to park” lots with guys collecting money in the lot—locals say those spots can feel sketchy and it’s better to go with a proper garage or marked street spot.  
  
with the show starting late, traffic will be less about the evening commute and more about the event crowd between 9:00 pm and 10:30 pm. get there on the early side if you're trying for the popular street spots or the lot across from the church nearby—those fill up fast. also, if you're parking on a dark side street, maybe bring a steering wheel lock for peace of mind, just a heads up.  
  
hope this helps and you have a sick night for x-coast.",1,1763758770.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False

*Before they met humans, Shraphen scientific advances were predictable and occurred in a steady flow. Exploration was a calculated process.*

*Then humans decided to show up, flipped the table, and the Shraphen quickly became as mad as the humans. This unholy marriage between technological and biological knowledge and development was made worse by us Gliders sitting on the benches, adding fuel to the fire.*

*What happened afterward can only be described as a scientific clusterfuck of epic proportions.*

**Memories of EatMyBalls, headmaster of the Terran Institute for Technology and Transmatter Science, at its founding ceremony, 35 P.I.**

*The vote to rename the Terran Institute for Technology and Transmatter Science has been rejected, and no further motions to change the name will be accepted. If someone has problems with the name, they are free to study at one of the other great Glider-led universities, like the Denmark Institute for Chemical Science.*

**EatMyBalls at a campus hearing, 36 P.I.**





The crew of the *Stefan Karl* sat in the living room of the ship. Each one was quietly checking his Data, making the humming of the small fusion reactor the loudest noise on the ship. They had arrived at Marjans Star two days ago and had made extensive scans of the area.

No one was eager to discuss the idea that the anomaly led to an artificial construct. As Dr. Vauban said, “I don’t want to think about it, or I might curl up in my bed and refuse ever to get out.”

Sokra drank another Coffee, the human beverage had to be a sort of drug, she could not explain her dependence on it otherwise.

Lieutenant Kendersson broke the silence. “What if it is artificial? Then maybe we just need to send an access code? I’d certainly put a lock on my private dimension.”

Sokra’s ears stood up. ShutUpBitch looked up from the drone’s sensor data, one eye almost closed and the other wide open — a Glider approximation of a human raised eyebrow.

Dr. Vauban was about to say something before he stopped himself and stood there with his mouth open, staring into nothingness.

*‘What if it’s not an access code but a routing address?’*

“Oh my God, the shield frequency!” Dr. Vauban slapped himself on the head.

Sokra could not believe they hadn’t thought of the obvious.

For Lieutenant Kendersson, it must have looked like the scientists had gone mad.

Where they had sat for a day, almost depressed, they were now frantically checking statistics.

Sokra checked the Magellan's logs from both journeys and the sensor data for the message torpedoes sent from Trkik space.

Five hundred twenty-one point five terahertz — human standard EM shield frequency.

*‘Traversing from Trkik space to here was instantaneous, but on our way from here to the Trkik, we were captured inside the anomaly. What changed?’*

“We broke out of there by transiting.” Sokra was deep in thought. Something about the chain of events reminded her of something — then she remembered.

“Nanotube weaving. It’s like nanotube weaving!”  
The whole room stared at her.

She looked into the questioning faces of the other crewmembers.

“Don’t you guys know nanotube weaving?”

*‘No technology on my old home planet, and the monkey offspring is happy if they manage a day without setting their testicles on fire.’*  
ShutUpBitch answered loudly enough for everyone to hear.

Dr. Vauban looked at her, slightly annoyed.

“When you want to weave nanotubes, you have to be careful not to turn them too much, so we created a device that takes care of that. It does so by placing a marker atom at one side of the tube.” She gestured with her hands to simulate the nanotube entering the weaver.

“If the tube enters one side of the weaving machine, the weaver knows exactly on which side it has to exit.” Sokra took a big gulp of her coffee. She needed more — the night would be long.

“The probes enter in Trkik space, and their shields scream out the target destination: here!”

“When we enter from here, our shields scream the same destination, so we come out… here.”

Dr. Vauban interrupted. “Stop. You say target destination — do you think the anomaly has more exits?”

Sokra nodded almost manically. “Yes. Why would you build something like this otherwise?”

Vauban didn’t give in. “As a retreat, maybe?” he shrugged.

“And wouldn’t you want your retreat to have exits?”

To Sokra, it felt like Vauban was reluctant to accept the idea that there might be more exits. She understood the notion, but that didn’t change how science worked. She had a theory, and now she wanted to prove or disprove it.

Ferdinand chimed in. “The idea of Renthai Sokra is intriguing. I checked the logs for indications supporting her theory and found something.”

The center of the table lit up, and a hologram appeared. It represented the EM spectrum of the anomaly when the *Magellan* first appeared.

*‘There — you see this residue? When the Magellan transited into the anomaly, it did so with the standard EM frequency. For the anomaly, this was now the frequency connected to Marjans Star. I guess.’*

Everyone around the table looked at the Glider. It was one of the rare times she had confessed to being unsure about something.

*‘What? How would I know for sure? I didn’t build that damn thing.’*

“So, what number do we dial to reach Trkik space?” Lieutenant Kendersson asked as he passed a new round of coffee around.

“I don’t think it has one. We never jumped from there *into* the anomaly, only through it.” Dr. Vauban voiced the concern that ShutUpBitch and Sokra shared.

“No, we didn’t — but I sure as hell blasted the entry open when I extended my A-Drive bubble to touch it and inject more realspace into the rift.”

Lieutenant Kendersson was again the center of attention for the scientists. No one had thought of that.

The scientists began checking their data again.

Looking through all the logs, they found what they were looking for — the frequency Lieutenant Kendersson’s *Sleipnir* had used to create the transit field.

Sokra worked with Ferdinand to adapt a probe to the frequency.

*“Renthai Sokra, do you really believe the anomaly is artificial?”*  
Sokra was surprised by Ferdinand’s inquiry. It almost sounded as though the VI was skeptical.

“I don’t know for sure, but if it is, it’s the biggest discovery of all our people.”

*“And maybe the last. A civilization that far advanced might not even see us as intelligent beings, but as a nuisance.”*

Ferdinand’s voice sounded somewhat concerned.

“We can’t change that.” Sokra didn’t know what else to say. Ferdinand was right.

Sokra finished the last calibrations and joined Kendersson in the cockpit. She must have looked distraught, because the lieutenant immediately asked her what was wrong.

“What’s wrong, you ask?” She pointed at the anomaly everyone just called Marjans Star — a perfect two-dimensional circle of nothing, ringed by majestic white flames of decaying protomatter.

“That’s wrong. Everything is wrong. If the anomaly behind this rift is artificial, the civilization that built it must be ancient. Not even ShutUpBitch has an idea how you can build something like this. She acts cool, but she’s scared to her bones.”

Kendersson just nodded. “And you’re afraid they might harm us if we continue our experiments?”

Sokra couldn’t believe the pilot — who in his right mind wouldn’t be scared, even terrified?

“Yes. How can you not be?”

The pilot pointed out of the window. “The rift is here, *Hyperion* blew through the walls like a wrecking ball, and our people in Trkik space will continue to send messages. They will even send ships in a few years. That’s how we function. So I think the best thing for us is to learn everything about that rift before the owners come. Because if they are alive, they will come to check who blew a hole in their wall.”

Sokra’s ears relaxed a bit. The pilot was right. They couldn’t change it. The door was open, so better check it out.

It didn’t change her fear; it just changed how she channeled it.

 

—————

 

The signal repeated.

Intelligence R-430E572 was woken by the automated surveillance systems. It checked the time since it had been put to sleep.

The system returned only error messages.

Intelligence R-430E572 measured annoyance in its internal programming. This kind of error only happened when the element 55-55-78 atom used to measure time evaporated, or when the element 92-92-143 energy source had again devolved to lead.

It checked the system readouts for clues as to why it had been awoken. There — a high-energy event had penetrated the acryptum from L-space.

The intelligence probed the databases for information about this part of L-space. The reaction time of the database was abysmal; large parts of the memory banks were reduced to dust. But the information the intelligence received cleared things up a bit.

The general area of the penetration was declared a quarantine zone due to hostile L-space entities. To be specific, the mass accumulation adjacent to the previous accumulation was under quarantine. Galaxy, this was the correct L space term

The intelligence began calculating. Given that element 92-92-142 had decayed to lead, a minimum timeframe could be assumed. In this time, the hostile species could have reached the neighboring Galaxy

Intelligence R-430E572 made a decision. It had to identify the cause of the penetration and sterilize the area if needed.

Any attempts to release the capsule housing the intelligence were unsuccessful. Investigation of the facility cleared things up. The whole complex was in a state of decay.

After countless attempts to reach any repair or maintenance intelligence, or even biological auxiliary maintenance, a repair priority list was generated.

The available tools of the intelligence were minimal. Only three of its pico-fabricators were functioning, and only one of its fluctuation energy modules still produced energy.

The intelligence began multiplying its fabricators. Those, and energy, were needed to fulfill its tasks.

Another signal was detected.

A tiny vessel had entered the acryptum. It had dragged with it parts of L-space. The negation and sterilizing field began dissolving the remnants of L-space.

The chances of the vessel escaping the acryptum were negligible; it would be dissolved soon. More annoying was the fact that the penetration was now initialized.

Initialization was planned, but this was too soon.

The vessel escaped — even more unpredictably — through another penetration. The risk of infection rose. Full activation was still ——Error—— time units away.

The intelligence began contemplating whether waking one of the \[Missing Data\] was needed.

What was that? Why could the intelligence not remember the \[Missing Data\]?

More annoyance was measured.

This cycle of wakeness would be worse than the last, and back then, it had to contain the acryptum after the L-space was generated in a high C-Class energy event.

The vessel was back. Both penetrations were initialized. Contamination was almost certain.

The intelligence observed. Since the facility was in disrepair, the \[Missing Data\] could not blame him. He was unable to react. Repair of the facility was still ——Error—— time units away.

——Error—— time had passed. Another vessel appeared. The intelligence concluded the biologicals had learned to navigate the acryptum. Infection was imminent.

The pico-fabricators were now in sufficient numbers to create nano-fabricators. With those, the energy supply could be stabilized. With stabilized energy, the facility could be maintained, and then sterilization could commence.

The other vessel was on its way back to the initial penetration side.

Intelligence R-430E572 was able to transfer a newly created observer aboard. Before sterilization could be initialized, classification was needed.

First indicators were correct. Carbon-water biologicals. Typical L-space infection.

according to the starbucks app: (because i'm not at work to check store resources)
- it might get 2 pumps (strawberry, caramel brulee, pumpkin spice w/ coffee base)
- it might get 3 pumps (caramel, MCC, pumpkin spice w/ creme base)  
- or it might get 4 pumps (peppermint mocha)
- or maybe it gets 5 pumps (CRC, apparently??? i've been doing 3 but the app says 5 ????)

i genuinely don't understand what the ""rule"" is here. i know cold bar pumps used to be a thing, and then we stopped using them, so maybe we're cutting the number of full pumps in half from the standard 2/3/4? or maybe we're not? maybe we're just throwing numbers at a wall to see what sticks??? why does a creme based frap get more syrup than the same frap with a coffee base?????????

THE BEAUTIFUL STORY SO FAR the simple version :)



CHAPTER 1



Over 10 million years ago, the Herald, was the most powerful man, mastering each and every aspect of magic. His followers called him a god and created a new religion called Heraldism! The belief consists of, THE HERALD IS ABOVE ALL, THE GODS GUIDE EACH FOLLOWER TO THEIR DESTINY AND GOALS IF ONE IS PRODUCTIVE IN ARCHIVING THEM, EACH GOD IS AN ESSENTIAL ASPECT OF LIFE, AND EACH SPECIES LIVE IN HARMONY TOGETHER. 

 So like that’s the basic beliefs of Heraldism, but our story doesn’t start here it starts in a town FAR FAR away. Urbis is a little town home to many different species. It’s the main trading area of Globlore. 

Globlore stretches all the way from the chilly towns to the west and all the way to the giant mountains to the east. 

 Once upon a time, while Green Goob was ready with excitement for the new Fortnite season, he was greeted with something he wish he never saw. A big old red note on his desktop he found from the dumpster. It read, “How do you use a shield pot, The Herald. ALSO TOOK YOUR FORTNITE ACCOUNT LMAO ILL BE HERE TOMORROW TO TELL 

YOU WHY GOOFY GOOBY. 

 This Inferior good so much in fact he stormed into the Alice’s Inn. The door bounces off the wall and Goob stands there with anger in his eyes. Garbon looks over to see a pissed off  little goblin, he instantly knew this was Goob. Goob regularly was angry over anything, he always tried to improve but never got to that YET. Goob full on sprinted over to Garbon and YELLED right at his face “MY FORTNITE ACCOUNT IS GONE”  Garbon clearly didn’t care but Goob insisted that they should find the Herald.  Garbon was hesitant at first, “How the hell are we going to find a literal GOD” Garbon perused. “Let me finish one sentence” Goob stated, Well I did get some weird and I guess they are supposed to be hints” “HINTS?” Garbon questioned. 

 Goob dragged Garbon upstairs by his wrist. They stopped by room 202, Goobs room. Once the door flung open Garbon knew what he meant. All over the walls were maps,hints, and pictures from The Herald. It started off with clue number 1. The MAP. “This isn’t no ordinary map Goob” Garbon said with certainty, “This is the one of the most important maps in history!” Goob glanced at him with questions forming all around him. Garbon continued, “This map is from The Heralds followers, it’s supposedly the route Herald took during his many expeditions.” “WELL LETS GO” Goob insisted. They ran down like children on Christmas Day. Alice leaned over to see what the noise was, before she could even think  Goob blurted out “ONE COFFE TO GO” Now Alice is the owner of Alice’s. Inn, a popular tourist spot in Urbis with thousands of years of history on it. Alice swiftly made that coffee and the Goblins went onto their adventure.

 Goob and Garbon got into their automobiles and set forth. As fast as they could they left Urbis in a rush and traveled down to the chilly and frosty town of Geniso. Once they got into the town it was entirely packed, full of bustling people trading, selling, and performing. Currently it was the towns yearly festival called “The Festival of Enlightenment”. The festival was about the Sun Gods returning as after the sun being out for a long time they celebrated its return. Goob and Garbon pushed away the selling vendors and went to over to the book store. They grabbed as many books over Heraldism as they could and threw the map down on one of the many charcoal black tables.

 Since Garbon COULDN’T read, Goob read off the many books over the Heralds travels. “THEY DON’T ALINE” Garbon yelled in frustration. Goob flipped through the pages as fast as he could until he stumbled across “The Journey of the Dragon” “IT ALINES PERFECTLY” Garbon squealed. Goob and Garbon gathered their money together but wasn’t enough for the expensive book, “DAMN, 100 dollars for this crap” Goob said in a frustrated voice. “Just rip out the pages, they would never know” Garbon whispered. They quietly ripped out the pages and returned to the bustling roads of Geniso.

Every Thursday morning I go for a 7-10 min walk from my house to a local convenience store to pick up a coffee and a snack (usually a chocolate bar or some crisps)

The convenience store has a deli, off license, ect.. the usual shit, (used to have an ice cream shop but that's been closed for years :c i miss it lol... and the aforementioned coffee machine. 

So here's the trick, the coffee machine is self service and you pay at the main till of the shop and it has a waste system,

You can select a Americano, cappuccino, cordato, or a lungo (they also have tea and hot chocolate)

The coffees are around 3€ - 3.50€

Normally you'd select one drink and let the machine make it once and if you wanted extra coffee youd simply buy a second coffee,
But since I have a crippling caffiene addiction, what my trick is, I select an Americano, let the two espresso shots pour into my cup, but let the water shots drain away, and then repeat the process again for a 4 shot esspresso 

It work because the coffee machine offers two different cup sizes 

This way basically get two coffees for the price of one

The shop is a large chain here in ireland, so its not like im robbing from some mom and pop place, (as the yanks say) and its also not stealing anyway since I still pay

I’m a pretty friendly and chill guy just looking to make some new friends to hang out with and play games. My main games have been FF14, Warframe, ZZZ, Wuthering Waves, Halo, and Overwatch, and lately I’ve been dipping my toes into survival craft games like Valheim and Enshrouded. I’ve also been messing around with Total War: Warhammer 3.

I’m always down to try new things so if you’ve got a game you love and want someone to play with, I’m happy to pick it up as long as it’s not a full-priced $70 game😂 Steam sales are my best friend.

One quick heads-up: while I enjoy hanging out, sometimes I get pulled away for a few days because of other friend groups, family, or just general real-life commitments. I promise it's not me losing interest! I’d actually love to make some long-term gaming buddies who are cool with that ebb and flow. I will always respond to messages though. Just might be too busy to hang out is all.

Outside of gaming I am a coffee nut and dream of opening my own coffee shop someday. I love art and drawing, though my tablet has gained a bit of dust this year due to a recent promotion at work. Suffering from success haha Big into oceanography and interior design as my main reading material on the side, yes they are very different I know 😂

If any of this sounds like your vibe, feel free to hit me up! Let’s chill, play some games, and maybe make some lasting friendships.",2,1763758662.0,GamerPals,2,1.0,False
1p3a4ee,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p3a4ee,Can someone at Paradox explain how Mesoamerica is supposed to work?,"*Crossposting this with permission from the Paradox Forums for visibility. Original post at* [the Paradox Forums](https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/can-someone-at-paradox-explain-how-mesoamerica-is-supposed-to-work.1878157/).

Since launch all Nahua tags have been broken.

That's over two weeks. And while we've gotten major gameplay reworks in hotfixes, changes to Cahokia and Inca even, we haven't actually gotten the fixes to Mesoamerica to make it playable. There are three main issues, one is recognized by Paradox while the other two are apparently as designed:

**1\] Reforming the Nahua faith does not remove the doom mechanic or annex altepetls (Nahua vassals).**

The Nahua religion has several reforms culminating in the Reform Society event which when completed removes Doom. Doom grows over time and represents the Nahua belief that if they don't attend to the ritual bloodletting of their faith the world will end and only the sacrifice of the royal family can prevent this. So, if Doom grows to 100 your entire royal bloodline is murdered. Doom scales with amount of territory owned. By the time you own all of Mesoamerica the Doom growth will have vastly, VASTLY outscaled all possible sources of reduction and your royal family will die every few months.

This \*would\* be compounded by the fact that the Reform Society event also annexes all your vassals, which would spike your Doom regardless of any efforts to mitigate it previously. Thankfully (?) however this too is broken, and your vassals remain unannexed (and likely completely disloyal as Doom also lowers loyalty and without war or captives your vassals simply grow to hate you over time regardless of any effort to stop it).

On a side note and iykyk, in my time playing Nahua I found decentralization to be the clearly superior choice. The devs believe that centralization is the obvious choice always. Make of that what you will.

[This issue is recognized by the devs](https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/nahua-reform-doesnt-remove-doom-or-annex-vassals.1877696/), and apparently has been recognized for some time, but isn't more important than rebalancing the whole game, apparently. 16 days and 7 patches.

**2\] There are no accessible Tin RGOs in Mesoamerica.**

  
*fig 2.1) RGO map of Central America*

This means that the only method of production for tools is stone. Unfortunately, across all FIVE markets, there are EIGHT populated stone RGOs.

*fig 2.2) Market map of Central America 1-4-1337*

*fig 2.3) Populated stone RGOs in 1-4-1337 color coded by typical market preference*

While the Azcapotzalco market has the most stone RGOs by far it is still crippled by a lack due to sheer demand. And the AI in the region has no problem soaking it up into Lumbermills while of course ignoring development of their lumber RGOs because of a lack of tools because, hey look, all the stone is being used by lumber mills!

Across all of my playthroughs the only way to mitigate this was to directly control all important RGO locations (all Stone and Lumber basically) and have market access so strong that you could exclude anyone else from the market. Only then can you begin the demolition necessary to even consider fixing the broken stone-lumber-tools cycle.

[One user on Reddit, likely after several cups of coffee at 4AM driven by the kind of madness only being an Aztec player can bring, managed to find one Tin RGO at the border with North America however.](https://www.reddit.com/r/EU5/comments/1oqvlkh/tin_rgo_location_in_america_for_my_fellow_aztec/) So, you know, after you've already solved the problem you can solve the problem. Delightful.

[This is apparently working as designed?](https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/no-tin-rgo-in-mesoamerica.1877700/) But you know what, maybe it is, because the Nahua do get access to an exclusive tech to make the lack of tin a non-issue, at least until mid game when they can access markets elsewhere or that ONE SINGLE node up North: ***Copperworking***! Except,

**3\] Copperworking doesn't allow production of tools without Tin.**

Nahua get, as part of a special tree in the Age of Traditions, access to a special tech, Copperworking:

*fig 3.1) Copperworking technology. Notice the copper coloration to the tools, distinct from bronze.*

Copperworking states:

*""Our artisans have begun to craft tools out of the metal found in our lands. If we were to master this art, it would give us a tremendous advantage on our neighbors.""*

Indeed! There is metal in our lands: Copper! (Tin too IRL btw but I digress). And further, the icon clearly shows tools produced from copper. The classic red-gold look is unmistakeable. The tooltip SAYS it lets us make TOOLS from the METALS in our lands. Those metals are copper. Those tools are copper. This would, in fact, provide a significant advantage over others especially since copper is fairly worthless without tin. So you might expect that because Paradox is telling you these copper tools that they're giving you are made from copper that they would be giving you copper tools made from copper.

[Unfortunately, it seems that Paradox does not agree with.... themselves? Their artists? Their writers? Their devs? Who knows!](https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/copperworking-technology-doesnt-allow-copper-tool-production-method.1877697/) This is apparently WAD because, according to the RESPONSE, we can use this technology plus tin to make tools :3

And that final part is sort of the stimulus to this crash out. I've spent a few patch threads pointing this out. I set an alarm to try and catch a Johan thread to make sure he saw it. I've offered to fix it myself for free, or for a token amount or whatever makes their lawyers happy because I'd just be happy to be able to play this incredibly fun game. But as hard as I am trying to help the devs, it genuinely feels like they either don't care or are actively dismissive of input.

Their answers to the bug reports are contradictory or seem to not even have been read. We're getting entire game-wide systems reworked, or at least messed with to such a degree that even the devs don't know the full scope of the changes, before everyone can even play the game in the first place.

So please guys, can we either just get some fixes for these or can you please help explain the paradoxical logic you seem to be using.",223,1763758624.0,EU5,32,0.97,False

I caught Giardia this past April/May.

Before realizing it was giardia, I became quite ill with insane diarrhea for a few weeks (maybe 3-4). I then got strep throat and went on a course of antibiotics for 10 days, and this was also when the diarrhea started going away. I'm unsure if this was because of the antibiotics (which was not flagyl, but something else), or just chance. When diarrhea returned at the beginning of July out of nowhere, I got a test and it came back positive for Giardia. I went on a course of antibiotics (metronidazole) and the totally went away. I may have had weird stool at certain moments, but nothing that stood out. Things were working business as usual for the most part.

I then had a large bout of diarrhea while travelling (Germany + Denmark + Italy) while also having a cold at the end of August and thought it may have been from the illness, possibly a mild flu or something, or the stress of travel that was causing the constant loose stool and urgency (always worse in the morning, but sometimes through the day too). When I returned home, it improved slowly but surely. I then got the flu at the end of September and my diarrhea was back with a vengeance - watery stool for a week or two, but then I had amazing stool for around three weeks. Things were totally back to normal. 

Suddenly toward the end of October, I began having bad diarrhea with urgency and gas, and I can't seem to shake it. Being mindful of FODMAPS and avoiding alcohol for weeks - nothing changed. I then  transitioned to following the diet strictly without any alcohol (though I am drinking coffee in the mornings), my stool is still ""off."" I'm only a week into the super strict FODMAP diet at present, but have also read that cutting yourself completely from certain foods can train your gut to work against you in the long run. I never had issues with bread or dairy in the past, but even over the past week of cutting these foods out totally, I don't see a huge shift in my stool.

I've read a bit about PI-IBS and suspect that this is what I'm working through at the moment, but at the same time want to enjoy my life the way I used to by eating what I want and drinking beer with friends (lol). I exercise regularly (weight training 2-3x week and cardio 2-3x week), and lead a fairly healthy lifestyle and usually get my 8 hours a night (9-10 on a good night, 6 on a bad night). 

Do you have any advice on this front? Have you come across this in your practice(s)? I think the truly baffling part about it all is how inconsistent the diarrhea has been, with weeks of it being bad and then suddenly being completely back to normal. This waxing and waning is what is also making me think that following the low FODMAP diet maybe isn't necessary. Please help! ",1,1763758525.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

Actually, wait, that's not true - I skip breakfast most days and just go straight for the coffee... Is that bad? I'm doing this ""low-acid"" coffee I got from Aldi recently and I actually think the reflux is worse on it. Maybe that's cuz I switched to half and half... I HATE half and half...

Uh, well...

Wouldn't mind doing some gardening again with my bride. Please be at least a little bit supportive of the Arts - at least tolerant, cuz I do some art stuff, too.

# The Google Nano Banana 2 Leak That Shocked Everyone

Let’s talk about what just happened.  
Google Nano Banana 2 isn’t just another AI tool — it’s a full-blown **image reasoning system**.  
This leak shows that Google’s new image AI *thinks before it draws.*  
That’s right. It plans, checks, and fixes its own mistakes before showing you the final image.

For years, AI images have looked weird — broken hands, messed-up clocks, nonsense text.  
But Google Nano Banana 2 changes all that.  
This new leak shows it’s powered by deep reasoning from the **Gemini team**, codenamed **GenPix 2**.

The result?  
4K image generation that’s consistent, logical, and freakishly real.



# How Google Nano Banana 2 Actually Works

Here’s what’s blowing people’s minds:

Google Nano Banana 2 works in **two stages**.  
First, it uses the **Gemini reasoning core** to understand your prompt.  
Then, the **diffusion renderer** turns that idea into a 4K image.

This means Google Nano Banana 2 doesn’t just generate pixels.  
It *thinks about the composition first.*

It plans the scene.  
It checks object positions.  
It makes sure everything looks right.  
Then, only after verifying, it draws the final image.

That’s why early testers say Nano Banana 2 can create *perfect clocks, correct text, and filled wine glasses that look real*.

This isn’t a small tweak.  
This is a new level of intelligence for visual AI.



# Why Google Nano Banana 2 Is a Game-Changer

If you make YouTube thumbnails, Google Nano Banana 2 will change your workflow overnight.  
If you make product photos, ad creatives, or social media visuals — this update is everything.

It fixes one of the biggest problems in AI design: **consistency.**  
Let’s say you generate a character in one image and want to reuse it in another — same outfit, lighting, background.  
Nano Banana 2 keeps all of that perfectly consistent.

It’s like having a digital artist who never forgets what your brand looks like.  
That’s huge for content creators, agencies, and brands building visual identity at scale.



# Google Nano Banana 2 on Mobile — The Crazy Part

Now here’s the wildest part of the leak.  
Google Nano Banana 2 reportedly runs on **Android devices**.  
A lighter version that works *on your phone.*

No cloud delays.  
No waiting for render time.  
You just prompt it — and get results instantly.

That means real-time creative generation on the go.  
Need a thumbnail before your flight? Done.  
Need a promo graphic while waiting for coffee? Easy.

And the leak hints at something even bigger — **video generation**.  
There’s mention of “temporal logic,” meaning Google is working on **AI that keeps things consistent across video frames**.  
If that’s true, it’s the start of next-level AI filmmaking.



# How Google Nano Banana 2 Could Change Your Business

Let’s make this practical.  
If you’re a content creator or business owner, this tool will save you money, time, and creative pain.

Right now, you probably spend hours cleaning up AI images in Photoshop or Canva.  
With Google Nano Banana 2, that cleanup time disappears.

Fewer edits.  
Fewer broken details.  
More professional output from the first render.

This means faster marketing turnarounds, better ad creatives, and more polished visuals across your funnel.

If you’re running an agency — imagine delivering *four times* the creative volume with *half the effort.*  
That’s what this leak points to.

And if you want to learn how to use tools like this to **scale your business, automate workflows, and save hundreds of hours**, check out my [AI Profit Boardroom](https://juliangoldieai.com/7QCAPR).  
It’s where I show you real systems we use inside my 7-figure agency to scale using AI — step-by-step.



# The Dark Side of Google Nano Banana 2

But let’s be real — every innovation has risks.

The better AI gets, the more dangerous it can become.  
If Google Nano Banana 2 can make flawless images, that means **deepfakes** become harder to detect.  
Fake photos, fake screenshots, fake news — all possible at higher quality.

We’ll need **AI watermarking**, **image verification**, and better trust systems.  
Because when images look *too real*, we need ways to prove what’s authentic.

There’s also the “confidence problem.”  
Sometimes, AI tools look perfect but still miss subtle details — an incorrect logo, a wrong date, a flipped symbol.  
That’s why you still need human **quality control**.

Never skip that step.  
Your reputation depends on it.

And if you want to see how to **QC AI outputs properly** while scaling your content creation, join the [SEO Elite Circle](https://juliangoldieai.com/0PNjLC).  
We teach frameworks that help you grow traffic *and* protect brand trust at the same time.



# The Real Opportunity with Google Nano Banana 2

Let’s zoom out.  
This leak isn’t just about better pictures.  
It’s about a future where **visual content is instant, consistent, and 4K quality by default.**

Imagine generating a brand photoshoot in seconds.  
Imagine A/B testing 20 ad variations before lunch.  
Imagine never needing to outsource basic design again.

That’s what Google Nano Banana 2 unlocks.  
This isn’t a small feature update — it’s an economic shift.

Because when creative production becomes free and fast, what matters most is **your strategy, your message, and your execution speed.**

The winners will be the ones who move first.



# What You Should Do Right Now

1. **Start collecting image prompts.** The better your prompts, the better your output. Write down what works.
2. **Audit your current image workflow.** Where do you waste time fixing things? Those are the tasks Google Nano Banana 2 will automate first.
3. **Learn AI automation now.** Don’t wait for this tool to drop — start with what’s already available. Tools like Gemini, Gamma, and Grok are getting closer every week.
4. **Think about your business model.** How can instant 4K image generation open new services or offers? The key is adapting before everyone else does.

Want help with that?

# Final Thoughts: Google Nano Banana 2 Is Just the Start

If half these leaks are true, Google Nano Banana 2 will redefine what’s possible in design, content creation, and brand storytelling.  
We’re entering a world where visuals are no longer a bottleneck — they’re instant.

The people who win are the ones who *adapt first.*  
Don’t wait for the official release to start learning.  
Start now.  
Build your workflows.  
Be ready to move when Google Nano Banana 2 launches.

Because by then, the game will already have changed.

Mixed U.S. job numbers provided no clear direction on when the Fed might shift its stance, leaving traders defensive and tech stocks leading the decline. Every intraday bounce failed to stick as uncertainty weighed on sentiment.

Analysts say the jobs report only deepened confusion, raising fresh doubts about the timing of potential rate cuts. Volatility stayed elevated into the close, with many traders rotating out of high-growth tech and opting for safer setups heading into the weekend. The tone remained cautious across sectors.

Midday action saw a brief spike higher, but momentum quickly faded as tariff concerns resurfaced. Brazil warned it could lose U.S. instant-coffee market share after Trump maintained key tariffs, adding extra pressure to consumer staples and commodity-linked names. That headline capped any hope for a broad late-day recovery.

As the week wrapped, markets carried a mix of caution and frustration. Tech weakness, murky macro signals, and trade worries kept risk appetite low. Analysts expect choppy trading to continue next week unless clearer data or Fed guidance emerges. For now, traders are watching volatility more than direction.

I've been having a lot of round ligament pain for days, but I don't want to just pop a Tylenol every 4 hours to dull the ache. 

I have my decaf coffee in the morning, but I'm much less apt to drink caffeine in the afternoon for a pick-me-up. Not just to avoid excess caffeine, but also to avoid disturbing my already light sleep and making me have to pee even more than I already do! 

And tonight I'm getting together with friends and I would love to have a drink celebrate the end of a very long, stressful work week, and socialize. But it's just not an option 

I guess my point is we take for granted the substances we can lean on usually. And it's only once they all have a greater impact on something we care about that we realize how much we did rely on those things. 

I regularly took painkillers for my period cramps, drank caffeine to get through the work day, and celebrated with glasses of wine. I'm not sure if I'm feeling bummed or frustrated or what about it, but just wanted to vent! 

And please note, I know that two out of three of these things are fine in moderation while pregnant - but I feel better about avoiding them and being a little bummed about it then taking them.

**Memory Transcription Subject; Corporal Noah Williams, US Army Remnants, Human Resistance**

*Date, Standardized Terran Time; December 25th, 2078, 5:00 AM USEST*

I woke up with a giddy excitement i hadn't felt since forever. I loved Christmas, one of the only times of year when families actually got together and made something out of the hell hole many of us call home. I slowly got up, seeing many of my squad mates and brothers in arms already up, sharing what little supplies of hot cocoa and coffee we had left, waiting for everyone to get up. The Arxur fleet left the night prior, so we started celebrating our beloved holiday. I made my way over to Sarah, who was just waking up herself. ""Hey."" She said with a yawn, myself giving her a nod as I sat next to her, shivering a little. ""Kinda cold today."" I commented, making Sarah laugh. ""Yeah, it kinda is. It fits, tough. At least with us."" She said, sitting up on her cot. She and I have been friends since we were five, and didn't want to ruin it with the population program, of which all persons must either have a partner or they will be assigned one. 

The only ones exempt from this mandatory drive were servicemembers, since the focus was family building, not just population, so it was up to the people holding the guns if they wanted to have a kid before fighting a Terminator. Sarah and I definitely didn't want that, so we joined who would take us based on our skills. I wanted to be a diplomat, but I had to give up my education on the matter to serve. Sarah wanted to be a scientist, and more or less got her wish by joining the Research and Hacking Division, she just works a lot with computers now.

I nudge her and gesture to the main tree near the city center. Nearly all of us had smaller trees with other presents, but those were for different divisions, squads, and ranks. The big tree is for everyone. Sarah and I made our way over, along with most others as everyone was awake by now. Kam and Tarva were also nearby, wanting to observe our traditions, no doubt. Our logistics guys got to the front and it became like mail call. Service was spotty on Earth, so many still wrote letters to loved ones in different cities and on the field. Packages were handed to patient recipients, and sometimes people were given more than one from under the big tree. I, personally had 3 presents from different people, Sarah having 4. Sarge had 2, but he seemed content. I mosied my way over to my squads tree, most of them already being there or were getting settled.

""Hey, ya fackin' wanka, ya wrapped this thing horribly, mate."" Said Robert Hardwin, part of the Australian Republican Army. He was like if an Italian New Yorker had a baby with an Australian from Queensland, and it got both accents plus slamg from both. But he was funnier than fuck, so I wanted to give him a joke book. I did run out of wrapping paper when getting to his, though, so the word 'Joke' was clearly seen. ""Hey, man, it's the thought that counts."" Said the third American in the squad, Hobart Jackson. He was a chill guy, but he was a beast in the field. Considering he had a Machine Gun most of the time, it made sense, but he was still cool all the same.

The other four were my friends and squad mates, too, Ivan, Red Army Remnants, Gunter, German Imperial Army, Bull, His Majesty's Royal Resistance Movement, and Hoang, Viet Mihn. And, of course, Sarge, US Army, like myself. Once everything was settled, we all began unwrapping. I did notice Tarva nearby, but i didn't pay her looking any mind. I first pulled out something from Hardwin, A book on 'mental self improvement'. I gave him a dirty look as he snickered, grabbing the next present from Sarge. It was a coffee mug with the word *I like to STEAL*, and next to each letter was a set of words that said, Strategically Transfer Equipment to Alternate Location. I chuckled, because I *did* sometimes steal stuff for the squad, by either swindling some poor lodgi guy or just up and taking it. He chuckled warmly as he unwrapped a helmet that said 'Best NCO ever'.

Ivan got me 2000 proof Vodka, saying that he'd had gotten better if there was better stuff in stock. I thanked him regardless. He also expressed gratitude after i gave him Moonshine of thr same caliber. Bull got me a hard cover of 1984, saying he had an extra copy and heard me mention wanting to read it. I high fived him, since I got him one of the few Harry Potter books I could get my hands on. Jackson gave me a new Smartphone, expressing that newer phones were dainty and easily breakable. I thanked him and smiled when he got excited over the gun cleaning kit I got him. Hoang have me an actual, honest to God *Mango*. I damn near jumped for joy as I whipped out my knife and began cutting, taking a bite out of the fresh fruit. Real Fruit was a rarity, especially since most agricultural fields were burned by Skynet to starve us, so a fruit like this must have cost hom a pretty penny. He seemed satisfied with the new machete I got him, but it seemed like it got the better gift.

I opened Sarah's next, finding a badass laptop that had a few games on it. I pumped my fist in the air, knowing she'd like the 'Code Genius' book i got her. Now it was down to Gunter's present. It was small and rectangular. I almost frowned, thinking it was just a protein brick. I unwrapped the gift paper and nearly dropped it. ""Gunter..."" I began, just as he was beginning to open the pack of history themed playing cards I got him. ""Ja?"" He replied, making a pleasantly surprised sound at the cards. ""Is this... *real*?"" I ask in disbelief, hands shaking as I held an actual chocolate bar. ""Ja, it is. Mein mutter owns eins of the final few schokolade factories in ze welt."" He said smiling, my friends going wide eyed as they looked at the bar. Chocolate was nigh impossible to find, and those who did have it, were *beyond rich*. Chocolate cannot be made in any sort of large capacity anymore because of the near nonexistent nature of Natural Sugar and Cocoa Beans. He essentially just gave me fucking gold for Christmas. If I sold this bar, I would be set for fifteen generations of wealth. I quickly stowed it in my coat, baffled, yet not wanting anyone else to see it. 

I looked behind me and saw Tarva, who seemed to be confused. ""Was that thing important?"" She asked, Jackson stepping in for me. ""Y-yeah, it was. Candy is near nonexistent because of how fucked our agriculture is. Just to create a single bar like that now? It would cost millions just to make."" He said, the Venlil seeming surprised. ""But... why?"" She asked, making me speak up. ""Skynet. They destroyed our agricultural system to starve us. We're barely getting by on our BRs."" I said, making her make a weird face. I began to elaborate. ""Brick Rations. The white bricks you see us eat? That's what most humans eat. Normal food is in such short supply, only the wealthy, lucky, and government get it. Regular Joe's like us get the bricks."" I explained, making Tarva seemed horrified. I'd be horrified too if the roles were reversed. She stepped closer and hugged me, taking me by surprise. ""No one should go through that. Not even Predators like you."" She said, my uniform shirt muffling her.

Kam was nearby and went to pull her off me, but she let go after a moment. ""S-sorry. It's just... i can't imagine..."" she began, only for Hobart to snort. ""Oh yeh, no food and loosing friends to the machines every day fucks up yer moral system. 'S why we aren't real emotional anymore. No more tears to give."" He said, causing nearly all of us to look at him, the guy putting up his hands. ""Can't puss out when facts are involved."" He said before I sighed. He wasn't wrong, but hopefully, with this truce with Legion, maybe we can be better, like how we used to.",10,1763757477.0,NatureofPredators,0,1.0,False

I’m sachin 22 M and I recently shifted to Kolkata for my job. The city is nice, but I’m honestly feeling quite lonely here. I’m an introvert, so making new friends is a bit tough for me.

I feel so trapped just from this. While I love the benefits of breastfeeding I feel like mentally I’m losing it. 
Then We had her two month appointment this week and doctor asked about her poops. To which I answered honestly, she has 2-3 a day usually and then he asked about color. Well they have turned kind of darker green the last few weeks. He said to go dairy free and see if that helps and they go back to the yellow color. My husband was with us and has been very supportive throughout our breastfeeding journey. I don’t know why when the doctor said this is what I needed to do I felt so emotional. And still do. We have a fairly heavy dairy diet and I’m fine being more cautious/limiting the amount but not necessarily dairy free. but my husband instantly started talking about changes and even telling me I should get a dairy free coffee on the way home. It was a lot to process and it felt like he was being so pushy about it. I hate this feeling because I want to do what’s best for my baby but I feel like mentally I am so tired and over breastfeeding. I feel like I’m starting to resent my husband and baby. All I want to do is go get formula and say forget it to breastfeeding.

**Memory transcription subject: Narini**

*Date \[standardized human time\]: December 13, 2136*

The human had been stabilized, at least for now, but he wasn't out of danger. Apparently humans were unusually prone to bacteria getting into wounds. I would have thought that this wouldn't have been an issue for a species that ate meat, but then again I was finding out a lot about a lot of things lately.

""So, who are you two?"" Chini asked. It seems that the three medical students had formed a small herd with him as de facto leader. ""We got your names, but that's it""

""I'll go first"" Sawil said as he rummaged through more human supplies, looking for something we could eat. ""I'm a technologist. I mostly write software, but I know plenty about mechanical and electrical systems too.""

""I'm guessing from your age that you're not officially trained or licensed.""

""Stars, no, but that doesn't mean I can't diagnose and repair a moto-wheel in my sleep"" Sawil chittered as he found a pack labeled *Peanuts*. ""Are these any good, Narini?""

""They're a legume, purely plant based. They're a bit salty, so find some water before you eat those.""

""Noted."" My friend flicked his tail as he contemplated the bag that was almost half his size.

""So what about you, Miss Narini?"" the med student asked. ""I can understand a tech nut wanting to see if he could get some salvage, but what's your reason for being here?""

""I was looking for..."" I started, then stopped.

""For...?""

Taking a deep breath, I started over. ""I was looking for a way to strike back at the Federation bastards."" Chini and Sawil both suddenly stopped what they were doing and looked at me. ""I am Narini, daughter of Foreign Minister Natoni. My home has been burned, and my father has been either arrested or killed. Even if it wasn't personal though, I am tired of seeing the bigger species kick us Dossur around."" The words started tumbling out, tapping into resentment that had been building for more than half my life. ""I'm tired of being the butt of so many jokes. Tired of everyone looking down at us both figuratively AND literally.""

""Well, we are kind of small, Narini""

""NOT HELPING, SAWIL!"" I was shouting now, my frustration exploding. ""I want to show that we can stand up for ourselves. That we are important! That we have a voice! And most of all, I want the damn Kolshians to pay for every bit of hurt they have done to us for all the years!

""Okay..."" Chini broke the spell with a sigh ""Okay, I think I understand. You were hopeful you could find something here that would let you... fight back?""

""YES! Stars above."" Bixit and Liral had come into the room now. I looked at the four of them, and just... kinda... sat down.

""Seemed a lot less complicated in your head didn't it?"" My childhood friend put his paws on my shoulders.

""It did...""

""You know, Miss Narini"" Liral said. ""You helped us save the life of a human earlier. Maybe it is that simple? Maybe your grand revenge has already begun?""

""We need more though... More strength..."" wheels in my mind suddenly started turning. ""What if we could gather more people to us? Sure, individually we're weak, but if we had hundreds, no THOUSANDS of angry dossur, maybe we could do it.""

""We'd need a symbol. Something our people could rally behind, and that the Kolshians would fear.""

""I think I know just the thing! Come on."" I said, rushing out the room. The others followed me down the hall to the cargo hold. The lights were on now, dispelling the shadows.

There, waiting silently in the center of the hold, sat Waldhexe.

""You... want to use the human war machine?"" Chini looked at me like I was somewhat PD

""Yes"" I practically whispered. ""No one in the Federation has seen anything like it. No one will know how to fight it. This is the symbol we need, right here.""

Bixit frowned. ""So, how do you propose to use it. It's built for humans.""

My hyper-comm data pad was already in my paws.

**Memory transcription subject: Erica Thompson, codename ""Tempest""**

*Date \[standardized human time\]: December 13, 2136*

I had just set down my bagel and coffee when my terminal chimed at me, notifying I had an incoming call on a secure line. Slipping the headset on, I keyed up the interface to see the sender, and was pleasantly surprised.

""Pecan,"" I said, using the codename Narini and I worked out for her. ""Good morning. How are things on your end?""

*""Good morning to you too, Er... Tempest. I need a few favors.""*

""Anything for my dossur friend. What can I do for you?""

*""Well, it'll be easier if... Gearhead... explains.""*

Narini handed off the pad, and a dark furred dossur came into view. I recognized him as one of Narini's associates, a dossur named Sawil. We knew he was communicating with a human through a game called *Lightning Conflict,* but I was surprised to see that *Tanks4Tanking* was actually Justin Martin, an engineer over at Rheinmetall-America. I flagged the human's identity as a possible asset.

*""Uhm, hello...Miss Tempest? My friend says you can help get us plans for a human vehicle?""*

""That depends on the vehicle, and why.""

*""Worse you can do is say no...""* Okay, that was definitely a human saying. I checked a few boxes on Sawil's file. *""I need schematics for an armored vehicle. I think you call them Tanks? If I am reading this correctly, the serial number is Pz-X 412391, but I can't figure out what the last character is.""*

I tapped some keys on my terminal, and raised an eyebrow at what came up. Panzer-Ten? Where did they come across one of those?! ""Does the last character look like a lion with a crown?""

*""I'm not sure what a lion is, but yes, it has a crown.""*

That confirmed it. ""How did you find that number?""

There was some shuffling, and Narini came back into view. *""We are at the site of a crashed human transport.""*

*""Liberty Class""* Sawil chimed in from off screen.

*""What he said.""*

""Are there any human survivors?""

*""One. There are three med students here with us, and we were able to stop him from dying.""*

""Okay, I'm going to need his identification. he should have a tag around his neck, if you can snap a picture of it for me. Back to the tank though, what are you going to do with it?""

*""We want to use it!""*

""What?""

Sawil's dark face came back into view. *""Na... Pecan... has this idea that it could be retrofitted for a dossur crew. With some good schematics we should be able to do the work, but I don't know any of the internals on this right now. Honestly I've never even seen one like this before.*""

""Whew.... That's a big ask, guys. I have to run this one up the flag pole to make sure it's ok to send the documents to you. In the meantime, any thoughts on recruitment, Pecan?""

*""Well, I have myself and Gearhead. And I think the med students are in. You three in? Yes, they're in. I think my next step is to get more people. If there is any way you can send other dossur our way, that would help.""*

""Will do. Watch yourself out there, Pecan.""

*""You too, Tempest.""*

1p39bzt,https://www.reddit.com/r/INFPIdeas/comments/1p39bzt/peru_a_model_of_andean_amazonian_and_coastal/,"Peru – A Model of Andean, Amazonian, and Coastal Community-Led Regeneration (#solutionsbycountry series)","Peru is home to cloud forests, glaciers, páramo grasslands, the Amazon Basin, and long Pacific coastlines, creating one of the most ecologically diverse nations on Earth. Many of the most effective climate and restoration initiatives are driven by Indigenous nations, high-Andean communities, coastal fishing groups and local associations who protect watersheds, regenerate forests, restore ancestral agricultural systems and rebuild marine ecosystems. Peru shows how regeneration accelerates when communities are empowered to manage ecosystems that sustain both culture and survival.


1. Amazonian Indigenous Stewardship Across Vast Forest Territories

Indigenous nations manage extensive Amazonian forest regions using traditional ecological knowledge that guides sustainable harvesting, wildlife protection, agroforestry and watershed care. Their stewardship protects biodiversity, prevents deforestation and strengthens climate stability across one of the world’s most critical carbon stores.


2. High-Andean Wetland and Páramo Restoration Led by Local Communities

In the high mountains, communities restore wetlands, puna grasslands and páramo ecosystems that regulate water flow, support biodiversity and supply downstream cities. These efforts include planting native grasses, protecting springs and improving soil-water retention to increase resilience against drought and glacier retreat.


3. Protection and Revival of Pre-Inca Water-Harvesting Systems

Communities in Andean regions restore ancestral water-harvesting canals, amunas, terraces and infiltration systems that store seasonal rainfall, recharge aquifers and ensure water availability during dry months. These systems blend cultural heritage with modern adaptation needs.


4. Community Reforestation With Native Andean Species

Villages across high-mountain zones cultivate native tree nurseries and restore degraded slopes with species such as queñua to reduce erosion, increase moisture retention, cool microclimates and strengthen watersheds that feed major rivers.


5. Coastal Mangrove Protection and Fisheries Regeneration

Fishing cooperatives in northern coastal regions protect and restore mangrove ecosystems that anchor fisheries, buffer storms and store carbon. Their stewardship revives marine nurseries and secures sustainable livelihoods amid increasing climate pressures.


6. Community-Run Amazonian Agroforestry and Sustainable Production

Smallholder farmers integrate cacao, coffee, fruit trees and native forest species into agroforestry systems that restore soils, support biodiversity and reduce pressure on primary forests. These systems strengthen climate resilience and diversify local income.


7. Glacier-Watershed Protection Through Local Monitoring and Conservation

Communities living near glacial zones collaborate on monitoring meltwater, restoring vegetation around lakes and streams, and protecting fragile alpine ecosystems. This work safeguards critical water sources threatened by warming temperatures.


8. Urban Restoration and River Revitalization Led by Neighborhood Groups

Community organizations in cities such as Lima and Cusco restore riverbanks, create green corridors, plant pocket forests and maintain community gardens that reduce heat, improve air quality and reconnect residents with nature.


9. Community Wetland Conservation in Coastal and Highland Regions

Local stewards protect wetlands that filter water, store carbon, support bird habitat and buffer floods. Restoring reed beds, native vegetation and natural hydrology strengthens both biodiversity and community wellbeing.


10. Renewable-Energy Micro-Projects Supporting Rural Resilience

Remote Andean and Amazonian communities deploy small-scale solar systems, micro-hydro projects and hybrid mini-grids to power homes, schools and clinics. These systems reduce reliance on diesel and improve local resilience as climate impacts intensify.",3,1763756739.0,INFPIdeas,0,1.0,False

My mother is 69 years old and her cognition is awful. She doesn't remember anything we talk about, and she can no longer do things like cook a meal or even prepare instant coffee. Physically she is capable of doing so, just not cognitively. She can physically take a bath, but if I don't guide her then she gets body odor because she doesn't understand how to get clean anymore. She developed cradle cap before coming to live with me because she doesn't understand how to properly wash her hair. Her closet is a mess without intervention. I have to put/keep her dirty clothes in a secret hamper when she bathes so that she doesn't wear dirty clothes. 

She also has trouble writing/spelling words and signing her name. She can't even do a puzzle because she doesn't understand it. She doesn't know the day, month, or season a lot of the time. When I read about the stages of dementia, she seems to me to be in the moderate stage. 

She recently was diagnosed with Mild Cognitive Impairment (even though it seems more than mild to me) and had an MRI. The neurologist said that there weren't any lesions and that the only thing they saw was brain atrophy from normal aging. I don't think she should be so confused at 69 from normal aging. Without a diagnosis I am worried I won't be able to get any help in caring for her. I am at a loss as to what to do.

They also said that getting neuropsychological testing could take a year.

The doctor's office said they could try a lumbar puncture, which could lead to a headache but could possibly help. Her neurologist is in her previous town, 4 hours away. We would have to go there because her new neurologist appointment isn't until May. They said that after the lumbar puncture she would have to lie down for the day.

Has anyone else struggled with getting a diagnosis when you know there is something wrong/some kind of dementia?  Any thoughts, advice, or experience is appreciated.

* your needs. Coffee Machines are divided into two types, automatic espresso machines or semi automatic espresso machines. Then....the portafilters available are in form of pressurized and unpressurized systems. So, before you buy an espresso machine, you should test your ability as a home barista. If you’re having certain barista skills, the semi automatic machines (Breville, Rancilio, La Marzocco) plus a proper espresso grinder are the great choice for you. Meanwhile, if you’re not having a proper grinder or certain barista skills, the automatic machines are the great choice for you.
* brewing capacity. When it comes to choosing an espresso machine, you’ll need to consider how many people will be drinking the coffee at home or how many cups you’re gonna enjoy in a day. If you only have around one or two cups of coffee in a day, a thermoblock-powered single group head espresso machine is the correct answer. However, if there are more than 3 coffee snobs at home, you may consider to have an espresso machine with a boiler system (Baratza, Lelit, Rancilio, Nuova Simonelli Oscar II). So, you can make espresso more quickly and practically.
* electricity voltage. Espresso machine will certainly consume a large amount of electricity. So, donnott forget to check the electrical power consumption of the coffee machine and adjust it to the electrical power in your home. This step should be taken into some consideration to prevent the MCB from reduced voltage, which can cause severe damage to your espresso machine.
* availability of spare parts. Choose the espresso machine with accessible spare parts, both local and foreign brands (Made in Italy). Don't hesitate to ask the seller or read the instructions for use and specifications before making a purchase. If the seller is felt easy and good in after-sales service, you can make a purchase.
* Separated espreso grinders.

My husband came with me because there was no way I was doing this alone (my therapist also strongly advised against going by myself).

I started by explaining that I wanted to talk about the last visit with the kids, because historically we’ve never actually addressed issues directly. My husband and MIL have talked about some things in therapy, but since I’m not part of those sessions.

Before I could even finish my intro, MIL jumped in with a list of disclaimers about herself:

* that she “needs to work on it,”
* that she’s “nervous” around us,
* that she’s “uncomfortable right now,”
* and that “stupid stuff comes out of \[her\] mouth” because of anxiety.

She also said that what we’re asking her to change is “almost impossible” because it’s “her whole personality.”

Then she said she feels very judged by me. Specifically me.

I calmly asked what I’ve done to make her feel judged. Her answer was basically:  
“I don’t know… the way you look at me… the way you act around me.”

My husband immediately stepped in and said, “She acts the same with everyone. This is literally just her personality.”  
But MIL shifted it to feeling judged by both of us — that she’s “never been good enough” and that she’s “trying so hard.”

I tried to explain that the issue isn’t that she’s “not good enough,” but that certain repeated comments and behaviors have had a negative impact on the kids. I reminded her that my husband had explicitly told her in therapy **not** to ask us in front of the kids if they can do things… and she still did.

Her response? She said she knows — but that if she doesn’t see the grandkids more often, we “can’t see her progress.” She asked how she’s supposed to grow if she only sees them every few months.

We explained (again) that the limited visits aren’t punishment — they’re about rebuilding trust. And rebuilding trust takes consistency, not more access.

Then she said she doesn’t think she’s done anything “that bad” to have an impact on the kids. My husband reminded her that past behaviors did lead to periods of no contact, which is an impact all by itself.

She insisted, “Well, I didn’t do it,” like the distance just happened to her. I asked her directly, “So you think everything has been fine all these years?” She quickly backtracked and said she meant just the last seven months.

My husband repeated that we’re not sweeping things under the rug anymore — we’re addressing things as they come up.

When we brought up the kids’ emotional experiences, she dismissed or forgot several moments. For example, when our son was four, she cried in front of him and told him she was “the only one who could take care of him” when we changed babysitters which caused him to be very upset about going to a new sitter(MIL was his sitter at the time). She claimed she didn’t remember saying that and that it “doesn’t sound like something she would say.” My husband immediately verified that it happened.

We also talked about the recent moment where my daughter backed away shyly, and she immediately said, “Don’t you remember me? I’m Grandma.” She tried to explain that away as being “in the moment,” but the impact is guilt, not connection.

She admitted she tends to go “over the top” and “lay it on thick,” but framed it as something she’s “trying to work on” because she doesn’t want to only see them twice a year.

At one point she asked, “If I text you asking how you are… do you not want me to do that?” and started crying again.

I explained that she rarely texts me at all, and when she did recently, it was very surface-level — and that’s why I felt this conversation was necessary.

She then said, “Not like we used to be,” and started reminiscing about when we lived closer years ago. I had to tell her plainly that those years were extremely unhealthy for us.

My husband talked about how we can’t “forget the past,” like she keeps asking — and that we’re working on unlearning our own survival behaviors because she used to guilt-trip, flip out, or bulldoze until she got her way.

She said she wants to keep working on things and asked what *we* want to do to improve the relationship. I told her honestly I didn’t know yet — because I didn’t know how this meeting would go.

Then she suggested the three of us sit down once a month or every month and a half to have “adult conversations” so we can “see her progress” and “feel more comfortable around her.”

So basically… the meeting ended with her:

* insisting she’s “showing up,”
* insisting she wants a closer relationship,
* insisting we should meet regularly,
* and still not taking real accountability unless we spelled out each example step by step.

I’m drained.

It was civil, and it didn’t explode — which is something…  
But honestly, I feel like we walked her through the emotional impact of her choices piece by piece, and she still defaulted back to:  
“I’m uncomfortable.”  
“I feel judged.”  
“I don’t remember doing that.”  
“I’m not perfect.”  
“I’m trying.”  
“But I need more time with the grandkids.”

Everything somehow looped back to her feelings and her access. I am emotionally exhausted from dealing with her drama.",170,1763756206.0,JUSTNOMIL,38,0.98,False

# The real reason Australia’s economy is underperforming

​

 Summary

Australia’s economy is underperforming due to outdated workplace rules and union monopolies, which hinder productivity and wealth. Despite microeconomic reforms in the 1980s and 1990s, the job market remained protected, allowing unions to maintain their power and influence. This has resulted in a politicised retirement income system and hindered further productivity gains.

​





A half-century on from stagflation, outdated workplace rules and union monopolies remain the biggest barrier to reversing the Australian economy’s slipping productivity and wealth.

Michael Stutchbury first encountered Australia’s unique industrial relations system as a cadet journalist on The Advertiser. David Rowe

I felt physically threatened just once, by a fellow named Doyle from the Firefighters Union. The local Shoppies head, a fellow called Goldsworthy, warned me off suggesting the union might ban the popular Christmas pageant put on by Rundle Street department store John Martins. In contrast to Doyle, Goldsworthy’s warning didn’t bother me as he barely stood five feet tall.

It’s also 50 years next year that a promising young industrial officer also joined the Shoppies union in the South Australian trades hall. His name? Don Farrell.

Half a century on, the convivial Labor trade minister is now ranked second on [*The Australian Financial Review Magazine*’s covert power list](https://archive.md/o/1LEaf/https://www.afr.com/link/follow-20180101-p5mnbj).

The Don remembers our shared time at Trades Hall well and insists that I was a leftie.

It was also a disrupted time amid the collapse of the post-war full-employment mantra that had been born out of the 1930s Depression. The 1970s collapse of this Keynesian consensus ensured that much of the IR debate was about macroeconomics.

Politics had become all about economics. So I combined cadet journalism with part-time economics study at the University of Adelaide which, by 1981, landed me in the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet in Canberra.

In his only budget just months before the 1975 Dismissal, Bill Hayden had said Australia no longer lived in a simple Keynesian world in which Treasurers like him could trade off a bit more inflation for a bit less unemployment.

That was after the unions, led by Hawke, had blown up the economy and Gough Whitlam’s government, even without Clyde Cameron, Rex Connor, Jim Cairns and Tirath Khemlani. Nominal average earnings jumped 68 per cent in three years, consumer prices rose 50 per cent and the profit share fell by four percentage points of GDP. The unions were his biggest problem, Whitlam told journalist David Barnett at the 1974 Christmas Party at the Lodge.

Michael Stutchbury, when he was Financial Review editor-in-chief, among the bound volumes of the AFR archives. Louie Douvis 

After Governor-General [John Kerr dismissed Gough](https://archive.md/o/1LEaf/https://www.afr.com/link/follow-20180101-p5n8zq), Malcolm Fraser set about fighting inflation first, with tighter budget policy and money supply targeting inspired by Milton Friedman’s monetarism.

A small group of agitators pushed for an alternative to Keynesianism, protectionism and regulation, including the new Centre for Independent Studies, the *Financial Review*, “The Modest Member” Bert Kelly, the forerunner of today’s Productivity Commission, one or two dissidents in the Reserve Bank and some backbench Liberal dries. Among the latter was young treasurer John Howard, who commissioned the Campbell inquiry into the financial system.

But Malcolm Fraser was a Black Jack McEwen or even [Andrew Hastie-style industry protectionist](https://archive.md/o/1LEaf/https://www.afr.com/link/follow-20180101-p5mxbq) and more of a conservative than a neoliberal.

As shadow industrial relations minister, Fraser had urged workers to join their allotted union. He was an admirer of Keynes and debated his advisers, including David Kemp, over Friedman and Friedrich Hayek. He quashed his young treasurer, Howard.

There was brief talk about “Americanising” Australian industrial relations. But, after the second OPEC oil shock, Fraser embraced a Queensland and NSW-based coal energy boom that the unions once more blew up.

The result was that Australia was slow to deliver a neoliberal response to the 1970s stagflation that in America produced Ronald Reagan’s supply side tax cuts and in the UK, Margaret Thatcher’s defeat of the unions. By the end of the decade, Singapore’s Lee Kuan Yew warned we were in danger of becoming the poor white trash of Asia.

Meanwhile, at the *Financial Review*, the black-cape-wearing editor PP McGuinness declared Australia had no alternative but to adopt an incomes policy to fight inflation and unemployment together.

Paddy previously had worked for then opposition leader Hayden, who was interested in the idea. And then Paddy famously and correctly predicted across page one that Australia was heading into recession and perhaps a depression thanks to the unions and the Arbitration Commission.

My background as an IR reporter, my economics degree and my year in PM&C convinced Paddy to hire me as the industrial relations reporter.

So I joined the long heritage of *Financial Review* IR reporters, from Geoff Cleghorn, George Negus, John Edwards, Neil Swancott and Larry Kornheiser, to Pamela Williams, Stephen Long, Mark Davis, Mark Skulley and, today, David Marin-Guzman.

Bob Hawke worked closely with ACTU’s Bill Kelty. Peter Wells

On my first day, I trooped down to Nauru House for the Arbitration and Conciliation Commission’s full bench national wage case. The next day, April Fool’s Day 1982, my first *Financial Review* story hit page one.

The angle was that the employers’ advocate, the Confederation of Australian Industry, argued that the government’s tight monetary policy made businesses more vulnerable to union strikes and so might perversely provoke higher wages. It was a classic political economy *Financial Review* story outside the template of the IR reporters’ club.

As the predicted recession hit hard, Fraser called an election, hoping to catch Labor out. But Hawke moved on Hayden and then trounced Fraser.

At the National Economic Summit a month after the March 1983 election, I reported on page one how Hawke and the ACTU ran rings around the employer groups and leading company chiefs including Rod Carnegie and Arvi Parbo.

But, apart from a return to centralised wage fixing, in key ways, business did well out of[ Hawke’s Accord with the ACTU](https://archive.md/o/1LEaf/https://www.afr.com/policy/economy/from-houdini-hawke-to-albanese-s-answer-20220728-p5b5je). The unions agreed to cut real wages and restore the profit share to revive business investment and reduce double-digit unemployment.

Labor right treasurer Paul Keating dealt with the Labor left by savaging the metalworkers’ union for having destroyed 100,000 manufacturing jobs.

The neophyte treasurer figured the wage Accord had given him the levers to control the macroeconomy.

And then came the big surprise. Keating turned the Accord into the foundation of the microeconomic reform agenda – the dollar float, financial liberalisation, a flatter tax system, lower import tariffs and privatisation.

An IR-based incomes policy became the vehicle for Australia’s version of the Reagan and Thatcher revolutions, delivered by the freakish personal combination of Hawke and Keating, the ACTU’s Bill Kelty and Simon Crean and mostly supported by the Howard-led opposition.

This delivered the productivity dividend of the 1990s that put Australia on the path from also-ran to become one of the world’s most affluent societies. 

But the ACTU ensured the job market was spared the microeconomic shake-up imposed on other parts of the economy.

The reason was obvious. The job market regulations provided legal protection for the union monopolies that owned the centre-left political duopolist and underpinned the whole labour movement exercise of power and patronage.

The new Labor government quickly abolished the Bureau of Labour Market Research. And it commissioned a classic IR club inquiry that dutifully endorsed the benefits of entrenching centralised wage fixing and the award system.

Not surprisingly, that triggered a counter-reaction. Gerard Henderson popularised the “Industrial Relations Club” as a form of abuse, including the IR journos. Ray Evans set up the HR Nicholls Society.

The Labor-ACTU regime further provoked New Right campaigns such as the Robe River dispute to de-unionise the Pilbara and the Dollar Sweets case run by a young Peter Costello.

While the ACTU had to agree to tighten workers’ belts in the short term, the Accord delivered long-term strategic gains to the unions. First, in a rare break with Keating, Kelty vetoed the treasurer’s Option C consumption tax at his 1985 tax summit.

And, hey, revealing Keating’s consumption tax plan had been one of my best scoops as an IR club reporter.

Second, the Accord Mark II delivered 3 per cent superannuation payments into industrial award bargaining, touted as the distribution of productivity gains to workers. The unions cleaned up after Whitlam’s attempts to set up a government-based national super scheme fell short and after Fraser failed to produce a Liberal alternative.

On page one, I wrote this up as a big deal. But who could have predicted it was the seed that turned into Australia’s $4.3 trillion superannuation system, dominated by union-led industry funds?

Basing “default” super in the IR system unfortunately has ensured that Australia’s long-term retirement incomes system remains politicised, full of governance issues and hence unstable.

Paul and Annita Keating after the 1993 election win.  National Archives of Australia

By the early 1990s, Keating had knocked off Hawke and, even following another nasty recession, won the “true believers” election of 1993.

He had deregulated the financial market and the product market. Now he and his IR minister Laurie Brereton sought to bring in enterprise bargaining to generate win-win productivity at the shop-floor level.

The Arbitration Commission judges resisted the loss of centralised wage fixing. But the unions still kept their privileged protections as Keating and Kelty tried to prove the system could be pro-productivity.

From 1996, John Howard and Peter Reith sought to correct Keating’s exemption of union monopoly privilege and the award system from the microeconomic reform agenda.

After the iconic waterfront dispute, Howard then used his thumping 2004 election victory to wind back the overall grip of workplace regulation and the unions themselves.

But, with no crisis to justify it, WorkChoices was too radical for the voters at the time. And the Labor and union fightback even knocked off Kevin Rudd as Labor prime minister.

The union warlords instead installed former industrial lawyer Julia Gillard, who kissed the ring of AWU overlord Bill Ludwig and declared the ALP to be a Labor party, not a social democrat party.

The IR system and its wage bargaining process had been disciplined by the dollar float, financial liberalisation and the dismantling of the import tariff wall. Union membership had fallen sharply.

But the Rudd-Gillard Fair Work Act restored order by knee-capping Keating’s enterprise bargaining and reinforcing the award system, the union movement’s safe harbour.

When I returned to the *Financial Review* as editor-in-chief in 2011, I latched onto a devastating confession from one of my 1980s contacts within the IR Club.

Australia’s “workplace relations architecture is essentially an attempt to institutionalise conflict, not to forge productive workplaces”, confessed Anna Booth, the former head of the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Union.

On the back of Booth’s op-ed in the *Financial Review*, I ran a mini campaign against the outdated assumption of an inherent conflict between the defenceless labour proletariat and powerful capitalist cartels.

Labor’s workplace minister at the time, Bill Shorten, shut up Booth’s talk by appointing her as a deputy president of the Fair Work Commission.

By 2012, Australia had experienced an unprecedented two decades of unbroken and low-inflation economic growth. Thanks to the productivity dividend from the 1980s and ’90s neoliberal reforms, and then the massive national pay rise from the China boom, Australia had not only avoided becoming the white trash of Asia. We had become one of the world’s most affluent nations, with per capita income higher than the UK, Germany, Sweden and Japan.

>

But the overly prescriptive IR system has contributed little if anything to this modern prosperity. And now the retreat on industrial relations, along with other policy failures, means this prosperity has been sliding for nearly a decade and a half.

After Tony Abbott won power in 2013, Dyson Heydon’s royal commission exposed the institutional corruption of labour supply monopolies such as the Health Services Union and of course the construction division of the CFMEU. Who could have known that the CFMEU harboured criminal bikie gangs?

But, from the Catholic right, Abbott was not a labour market neoliberal. And, to this day, the capital L Liberals remain paralysed by WorkChoices.

When Labor, led by Anthony Albanese, won the 2022 election, it should have been obvious to business groups that, as in 1983, they were heading into a stitch-up.

The [2022 Jobs and Skills summit](https://archive.md/o/1LEaf/https://www.afr.com/politics/federal/won-t-get-fooled-again-business-unites-ahead-of-productivity-summit-20250720-p5mg9v) was Whitlam acolyte Albanese’s insurance policy against Rudd’s fate. Before business had blinked, the summit effectively rubber-stamped ACTU demands for a return to pattern bargaining and the so-called same job, same pay legislation that targets BHP and Qantas.

Compared with the 1970s, the problem now is not so much high inflation and high unemployment. Now we have an independent Reserve Bank to deal with inflation.

Demographic changes mean that close to half a century of insufficient demand for labour is now giving way to chronic shortages of labour, including for construction workers to build all those houses we need.

The problem is more about the weak microeconomic growth foundations. Labour productivity is stuck at 2016 levels. The RBA has lowered its estimates of Australia’s annual economic growth potential to just 2 per cent. The budget faces a projected decade of deficits, even without an increase in defence spending.

During this year’s election campaign, I asked Labor’s then workplace relations minister Murray Watt whether he would concede that “if we don’t get a pick-up in productivity, there will be a limit on getting further real wage increases”.

Part of Labor’s political mythology is that it can regulate wages higher, even in real terms.

So Watt rejected my proposition saying that: “I don’t think it’s correct to say you can’t have real wage growth without stronger productivity growth.”

This becomes even more unlikely now that Australia has lost the cheap energy advantage that previously helped us run a high-wage economy.

Cheap coal-fired energy attracted the capital to build a string of nickel, copper, aluminium and lead smelters and the like in the 1960s, ’70s and ’80s. Now these[smelters are either going under](https://archive.md/o/1LEaf/https://www.afr.com/link/follow-20180101-p5nfsg) or being propped up by taxpayers. Not much of a Future Made in Australia there.

Australia got rich exporting close to 1 billion tonnes of iron ore each year. But Labor’s IR changes are now allowing the unions back into the Pilbara. The last time that happened, the Japanese steel mills bankrolled the Brazilian iron ore industry as a more reliable alternative and Bob Hawke had to tell the shop stewards to back off. 

Australia still persists with its unique phenomenon of 121 so-called modern awards, dictating thousands of prescriptive work classifications, minimum wage rates, allowances and penalty rates that even snare such self-righteous employers as the ABC in supposed systemic “wage theft”.

But there’s something else. At CIS, it’s my assessment that today’s regulatory challenge is qualitatively different from the 1980s agenda of floating the dollar, deregulating the financial system, lowering the tariff wall, privatising the Commonwealth Bank and the like.

We know about the explosion of red tape and, for instance, how many licences are required to set up a local coffee shop – answer: 36 in Victoria.

But today’s regulatory burden also is more about the state requiring businesses to do things on top of their actual business of delivering goods and services that customers are willing to pay for.

Hence, companies are required to reduce the carbon emissions of their customers in another country. To police global supply chains to eradicate modern slavery. To become conscripted agents of law enforcement, such as against money laundering, and cop massive fines for relatively innocent breaches.

This new regulatory compliance burden makes it more difficult to offer new home loans, to build more houses, to install renewable energy investment, or to open a new mine or gas field. The Macquarie Group’s estimated annual compliance bill has been as high as $1.2 billion.

Or business is supposed to drive social change by ensuring gender equality – or to be responsible for the mental health of its workers.

A whole set of new regulatory rights is accumulating on top of the traditional employment contract. The Fair Work Commission rules that Westpac must allow an employee to work from home five days a week because it’s not convenient for her to come into the office.

Now the NSW Safety Regulator is interfering in basic business operations.

The federal government has cut back on foreign students. That’s hitting the universities’ revenue line, forcing them to reduce their costs.

But Safety NSW slapped a “prohibition notice” on redundancies at a Sydney university because it exposed academics to “serious and imminent risk of psychological harm”. What would a private business at risk of trading insolvently do in this no-win regulatory conflict?

Australians have shown they are comfortable with a Whitlam-lite increase in the size of government and even with legislation to guarantee they can work from home.

The Liberals couldn’t even prosecute the political case against giving taxpayer-funded fat cat public servants the right to never come into the office.

But, in an echo of the 1970s, the Australian economy will continue to underperform. As the disappointment mounts, so will the demand for genuine productivity reform, as it did back then.

Jim Chalmers sort of knows this, which is why he is searching for Labor-acceptable productivity policies – such as the ban on non-compete clauses announced in this year’s budget.

But this is just a confected non-problem. The supposed solution will just add more regulatory intrusion into the employer-employee relationship and even undercut the incentive for bosses to invest in their workers.

And the touted $4 billion benefit to the economy is basically an assumed number.

Any benefits would be offset by the unquantified costs of also allowing business to collude in striking one-size-fits-all pattern bargains. “We don’t want to compete on wages,” says Tony Burke.

To the contrary, Australia’s high-wage economy is unlikely to be sustainable unless business is allowed to escape its adversarial IR straitjacket and to incentivise its workforce to perform at high levels of productivity and flexibility.

An engaged and productive workforce should be a source of competitive advantage in responding to changing market demand, technological disruption and a less collectivist and more diverse society.

Making the case for this requires some serious evidence-based research to highlight Anna Booth’s insider confession that the system is not designed to forge productive workplaces.

Sadly, it won’t come from the Productivity Commission. Nor from the Liberals unless they are provided with evidence on which to mount a politically compelling narrative.

For me, it’s been close to a professional lifetime since the unions blew up the Whitlam government, since Malcolm Fraser passed up the post-Whitlam opportunity, since Hawke and Keating quarantined the IR system from the neoliberal reform agenda and since John Howard arguably lacked the preconditions to sell WorkChoices to the electorate.

At the Centre for Independent Studies, I’m keen to get some IR legal warriors together with some data-capable economists to make the case.

All the packages were literally being thrown from the truck directly to the floor of the hub without any care and a person from the hub scans the package and throws it to the other end of the room. No wonder many of the packages get damaged severely.  
I've seen many incidents here that the packaging of PS5 is damaged and the box corners are torn/damaged. This is probably the reason.

I'm pretty sure even the Amazon packages are handled like this by the way I recieve my orders.

I dont even know if the seller is to blame here for not packing it to handle the harrassment or if Flipkart/Amazon are at fault for not managing these hubs properly.  ",3,1763756026.0,IndianGaming,1,1.0,False
