1os1ytz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Is_He_Cheating_/comments/1os1ytz/is_he_cheating_or_am_i_crazy/,Is he cheating or am I crazy?,"I am not sure if I’m seeing something in tea leaves or if he is cheating. Background: Together 2 years Living together 1 year He has two kids still at home (11 & 13) I have one grown daughter not at home (22) and in college

Staring about April he’s been a bit odd. Like picks fights, doesn’t give me as much attention, etc. I’m American but living in UK, he’s English

The “clues”:
He has a guy who works for him, let’s call him Jack. He’s been working for him about a year and he picks him up every day for work since Jack doesn’t drive. This is important. 

He picks me up from the train one night about 3 mo ago and there are two fine bone china tea cups in the cup holders. Very pretty floral designs. I asked and he said “oh Jack made us coffee this am”. In a year Jack has never brought coffee before to my knowledge. Jack is single. So the cups are odd. 

A week or so later he picks me up again from train and the passenger seat is like all the way reclined. So I say, “what’s up with the seat?” To which he says “oh Jack adjusted it today.” I said “oh is his back hurting?” He said “no, why?” I didn’t respond but in a year the seat has never been altered. It was like reclined like if you’re making out. 

My partner works out every day. He runs on the treadmill about 30 min then lifts. So around this same time he all the sudden starts running like outside. Well just be on the couch and he’ll say “I’m going for a run”. He hasn’t done that in the 2 years we’ve been together until now. 

He looks at jobs now every Saturday afternoon. For about 3-4 hours. Again new. There were some Saturday’s he would but now it’s every single Saturday. 

His phone was blowing up at night. Like really late texts and really early texts. 

So I finally just asked “are you seeing someone else?” He flipped out. Like got super angry. 

Told me I was crazy and it’s clearly something in my own head I need to deal with. 

But the the texts stopped. No pretty cups appeared again. The passenger seat was never moved again. He stopped suddenly going for a run at night. 

He also said he doesn’t do social media. But one night while scrolling he came up as a suggestion. I screen shot it and texted it to him. His profile pic was weeks old. He said he needed it to post on his business page. But then didn’t send me a request. 

Btw, he’s been posting since I’ve known him on FB for his business and never bothered to change his pic, until just now. So I knew he had at least a profile but went with he’s not active, until I saw the update picture. 

Then today I got home from a business trip. I had been gone a week. I went upstairs and there was a throw pillow from the couch on the side of the bed. The pillow has never been removed from the family room. 

So I asked why it was there on the floor next to the bed. He said, it’s always been in the bedroom. I said no, it’s never been in the bedroom, it’s always on the couch and was when I left. He said “one of the kids must have taken it upstairs”. The kids don’t really go in our bedroom. It would make more sense to blame them if it were in one of their rooms. 

So. Am I crazy? Imaging something and seeing things that aren’t there? If I’m not crazy, how do I prove it?",1,1762639649.0,Is_He_Cheating_,0,1.0,False

1os1xfs,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/1os1xfs/parallel_industries/,Parallel Industries?,"5-6000 years ago, the Ancients Beyond crashed their mysterious vessels called ""escape pods"" into the[ Dragonhead Continent](https://steelsmiter.blogspot.com/2025/11/crystal-gashes-campaign-setting.html). Something magical about the energies caused the people there to transform into what we on earth think of as various Fantasy Races**^(TM)** that happened to show up in JRPGs. 

These ancients taught the transformed beings about progressively advanced technologies over the course of a millenium or two (they are genetically ancient, quite capable of Sci-Fi assisted Methuselah class lifespans), gradually getting them somewhere between what we think of as Renaissance and Industrial Revolution technology in that time.

New ancients were later born, with no connection to the originals, somehow inheriting their (probably nano?) genetics. Archaelogical digs later found their Sci-Fi Tech**^(TM)** and the resulting world ends up with a lot of different places at a lot of different tech levels that mirror our own.

One thing *I don't* want is ""These ancients came from an advanced version of Real Earth"". What I want is ""wherever they did come from, their businesses *resembled* real earth businesses, or make real world references."" For example:

* I stole one ""Javascriptorium"" from here which is a place where you can pay for coffee by either scribing books by hand, or doing code work.
* Petite Pati's is a name that means ""Little Master's"" and they make topped flatbread pies they call pitch pies.
* Carlo's Crustacean Cottage just randomly came to me, I figure you probably get that one.
* Waleed’s Mega Market is a big box store that was founded as a mom and pop store by a merchant family in the Tung Khanate and exploded when a goblin married into the family and took it over. the thing that keeps it from being Walmart is that the world hasn't stumbled into that linguistic curiosity.
* Bast Buy I believe I also may have stolen it from here. It's a Nekojin entertainment center.
* Kase's VRcade: A virtual reality amusement center ran by a Rattenmensch named Karl Spass Kase, which is often shortened to Karl S. Kase.
* I'm calling the internet ""The Wire Maze""
* Hixton Farm Mechanika and Tools: An agricultural supply store that deals in everything from gardening claws and trowels all the way up to automated harvesters. It's somewhere between John Deere and Tractor Supply, founded in a town called Hixton for what I think of as an obvious joke.

I am trying to find someone in SoCal or anywhere in the US before the end of this year. I would love to find a woman who will accept me for who I am, support me, and help me be the very best I can be. I would also like to meet in person one day if that is okay with you because I don't want to be mostly long distance or online if you live outside of California and are able to travel.

About me:

• I will be 19 next week.

• I am 5'1, if you like short femboys. I also have fluffy black hair, dark brown eyes, a cute baby face, thick thighs, and a soft butt.

• Despite what the title says, I am a little menace and kinda have a mischievous side. I can go from being a cutie, to a chaos gremlin. Especially when I have had a lot of sugar or even the tiniest amount of caffeine.

• I want to do the best I can to help others and make others happy. I also like to think of ways I can do so.

• I am very good at cooking. So far, I am able to make stuff like sandwiches, hot chocolate, mocktails, and coffee that look and taste like the kind you would find at cafés and restaurants. I'm an amateur though, so it would look slightly messed up and I might need help with the stove and heat as I am afraid of getting burnt. I am still learning though, so that's good.

• I want a mostly FLR(female-led relationship) is because I would want to be the one who helps prepare food and do some chores. It would be great to be equals, but I want to be guided and taught to do my part well so I can be a good boywife, or whichever sounds best.

• My favorite holidays are Halloween and Christmas. One because of candy as well as getting to dress feminine without having the scary feeling that people are judging me, and the other because of the warm comfy vibes and magical feeling.

• I am a big(ironically lol) cuddle bunny. So I like being comfy and enjoy stuff like snuggling, maybe lap pillows, being under a soft blanket while watching a movie, or anything that would sound nice.

• I am scared of most things, but will get brave and confident at times. Especially when I am very determined. But I am scared of things like the dark, loud noises, overstimulation, lightning, yelling, really scary stuff, loneliness, and judgement for liking feminine stuff.

• Some of my interests are Sanrio(mostly Cinnamoroll and Kuromi), plushies, Stitch, feminine clothing, animals and dinosaurs(both of which have fascinated me since I was a kid), Scooby-Doo, 2000-2010s stuff, anime, and horror(I hate jumpscares though). If you don't know what any of these or the other stuff below are, I would be glad to share them with you if you'd like.

• I like going on walks sometimes when it is not dark or when there is a lot of people or light. Mostly during the day.

• My top favorite bands are Ice Nine Kills, Simple Plan, Anarbor, No Doubt, Linkin Park(2000-2010s era), BTS, My Chemical Romance, Paramore, RADWIMPS, and Pierce The Veil. I also like songs from back then.

• I play guitar and piano, plus I am very good at singing.

• I game(rarely) on PlayStation 4. My top games are GTA Online, Fortnite, Minecraft, and Fallout 76. I also have a DSi, Wii, Nintendo Switch, and Meta Quest 3. But I do not play all the time as it gets boring and kind of stressful.

• My favorite flowers are cherry blossoms because they look elegant and to be honest, smell like cherry cola. Also because cherries are one of my favorite fruits and it is my favorite candy/frozen treat flavor.

• I may be autistic, but I wasn't diagnosed for it. However I show signs of it such as reacting negatively to overstimulation, or hyperfixations on certain things.

• I am kinda sensitive, so take it easy on me.

• I have Snap, Insta, and Discord if you want to talk off here after a while. Same goes for gamer tags and pics. I do have TikTok, but I am not including it here just in case it gets shut down again.

• Some of my favorite foods are burgers, pizza, pickles, cookies, sandwiches, and anything yummy. I also enjoy fruits and vegetables like strawberries, mandarin oranges, rasberries, grapes, bananas, pineapples, blueberries, potatoes, broccoli, corn, and bell peppers. But I do not like popcorn, avacado, sour cream, eggs(by themselves), and ranch dressing. I also cannot have grapefruit because it will mess with my medication.

• I am a writer and artist with big dreams of bringing my stories and the characters in them to the small and big screen. In animated, and maybe live-action form one day.

• I sometimes like reading graphic novels, romance stories, and funny books.

• I like movie musicals like KPop Demon Hunters and The Greatest Showman, aka, the kind where every ten minutes or so, they break out into song. This is a joke, so please do not take it seriously.

• I can't drive yet and do not have a license. But I want to learn how to one day so I can drive myself, and also because I would love to one day own a Volkswagen Bus or Ford Econoline.

• I like indie animated shows and web series, comedy movies, and adult animated shows.

• I am an agnostic atheist(if that's an actual thing because idk if it is), because after experiencing some trauma, medical emergencies and so, I felt betrayed and gave up, as well as the fear of being judged for not wanting to be in traditional gender roles and dressing feminine. But if you are part of a religion or are religious, I respect your right to practice it.

• I am into some stuff like gentle femdom and others like that because I am kinda fragile. However, I would love to wait until we are comfortable with each other and click before going there, and I want your consent beforehand. You can be cheeky and flirty though, and when we get there, please be open-minded. Still, wait until we have talked for a while before going there.

About you(don't worry, some aren't requirements and my apologies if some aren't worded right or sound offensive):

• Height range is either 5'3 to 5'11/6'0+.

• I am mostly into Black women because I think they are attractive and are uniquely pretty in the best kind of way possible. Especially with hairstyles such as afros and braids because I think they look really cool and give off a sense of confidence and not being afraid of being yourself. But any other background or such is okay, so no worries. Sorry if ""background"" is not the correct term, so please don't be offended.

• Average build, athletic, curvy, chubby, heavy-set, muscly, muscular, or anything like that.

• Biological.

• Honest. I want to know what is bothering you so I can make you feel better, or if something is wrong and you need my help.

• Kind and considerate toward others. As well as aware of others' feelings and such.

• Reassuring, understanding, and comforting.

• Monogamous.

• Must not already have kids or a significant other. I do not want to and am not trying to be a homewrecker or want to be caught in an affair or be a sidepiece, since that is wrong.

• Works out, goes to the gym, and does physical activities. But does so in moderation. Not required though if you do other stuff to stay healthy. If you do work out, I would gladly do so with you because I want to make sure I can be good enough.

• Is kind of quirky and a bit goofy while still being cool and awesome.

• Smart and funny. Enjoys playful banter and playfighting.

• Independent, but not afraid to ask for help when needed. Especially if it is something hard to do by yourself.

• Left-leaning/not conservative. Pro-LGBTQ+, BLM, and such.

• Pacific or closer/similar time zones(limit is three because more than that is confusing).

• Drives and has a license and/or car.

• Is a pet person as long as you don't have any poisonous/very dangerous reptiles or creepy crawlies. I have slight arachnophobia and insectophobia.

• Is not findom, ghosts/blocks after a while, faker, dry texter, and anything as such.

• Doesn't do drugs, vape, and/or drink a lot. It is okay if you drink in moderation, just not to the point of being tipsy and unable to walk or drive.

If any of this interests you, don't be afraid to DM me. When you do, please start with your name or nickname, age, height, and hobbies/interests. Sorry if this was a lot to read and is asking for a lot.",1,1762639277.0,IntrovertDating,1,0.99,False

1os1t2b,https://www.reddit.com/r/valzubiriagenda/comments/1os1t2b/what_is_valzubiriagenda_and_some_ideas_and/,What is #VALZUBIRIAGENDA and some ideas and insights,"# The 3 basic parameters of hashtag #Valzubiriagenda:

1. **We artists and everyone else can write and self-publish art- and artist-related books: memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs.** Books are forever. Pamphlets and brochures are not books.
2. **We announce a schedule of increasing prices of our art pieces,** which includes quantities (scarcity numbers) per price point and overall (the total quantity of art pieces we might ever make). This helps art traders, art investors and art collectors speculate or even stop speculating and instead join a community of investors working together to hopefully skyrocket to the higher announced prices in a shorter span of time.
3. **We can use the NFT world, because NFTs provide the tracking (who owns what) and trading.**

We can also not be involved with NFTs. Stores and individuals can help sell art using online presence and our catalogs in the stores. If this trends, or once this trends, even expensive art can be sold by neighboring businesses, without exclusivity. Commission systems do not have to be standardized. Art investors can produce their own catalogs to leave at the cafés. Even the cafés can produce their own catalogs.

**Valzubiriagenda NFTs**

**NFTs only came about a few years ago.** But I had been working on this since the 1990s. I wrote a book, **Valzubiriagenda**, along with fellow artist **Silverio Perez,** and released it in 2018 (Amazon and elsewhere), tackling everything related to #1 & #2. We'll come up with #3 in a later book/ memoir/ marketing book.

Any artist, including tangible artists can release 10,000 NFTs if the artist chooses to do so. For tangible artists, the NFT first becomes an Art Commission Contract for sight unseen, yet-to-be made art. Once the art is made, the NFT becomes proof of ownership that the actual, tangible art is theirs.

**Warehousing our tangible art**

Another related idea is that the tangible art may be warehoused by the artist so that the NFT traders continue to trade. This means that even 10-ton 10-foot tall sculptures can be owned and traded by anyone without worrying about shipping, reshipping, scratches, smudges, parts breaking off, etc. The newness of the pieces remain because they are stored by the artist, source, gallery, etc. The art piece gets shipped to the art collector, the ultimate owner.

An artist who makes ceramic coffee mugs - smaller art pieces, can release 10,000 NFTs with a schedule of increasing prices so that NFT traders can trade immediately. The 10,000 coffee mugs can get damaged, so as they are made, they continue to be stored by the artist, until the time when art collectors decide to have the art pieces shipped to them.

**Why only now?**

I decided to write as many book-length memoirs as I can before I came out to promote this.

I'm an artist and an author. Both need time to ""master."" I would not even fully use ""master"" on myself, because there's always something new, even to my own art, my own writing and publishing.

>*I am now claiming that I'm the visual artist who has produced the most artist memoirs in the world.* I have 5 on Amazon. I count **Valzubiriagenda** as both a marketing book and a memoir-of-sorts, because it has a lot of my own life lessons on writing and publishing. I would not care to contest my claim of having the most memoirs. I will release 5 more over the next 3 years.

**BARTER! Get help to write, photograph art and publish your books!**

Anyone can hire 11 ghostwriters for 11 memoirs. If you can make art, but you cannot write, then barter your forever art with those who can help you produce forever books.

I don't feel the pressure of writing and publishing because I feel my focus should be on art students and art experts who would study my art and my books 100 years from now. Don't expect relatives and friends to read your books.

**I call myself the Dollman**

For my NFTs, I am proposing to make dioramas - my original, costumed, bejeweled porcelain dolls in backdrops that will also have precious metals and gemstones. This way I can incorporate precious metals and gemstones in my work, to make sure that people perceive my art as expensive, just in case I myself don't become ""famous"" - there's no need to get world famous. We are artists and all we need to do is to satisfy the art niche.

**Use your laptop now!**

I will encourage you to start writing your book-length memoir. Write, Edit and then Self-publish it. Get help. Why wait a hundred years for someone to write about you when all you need is a laptop and a nearby coffee shop.

Don't start counting chickens before the eggs hatch. I have encountered a lot of would-be writers who immediately see themselves as bestselling. world famous assets to society. Two even wanted me to sign NDAs (Nondisclosure agreements), because they did not want me to steal their book ideas.

Here's a suggestion. I would not personally do it. From one manuscript can come 2 books: The Original Draft (unedited, with misspellings, considered to be an art piece, scanned pages(?) of your handwritten original effort), and The Final Edition (edited).

**PROVENANCE!**

Another way to enhance our investability, tradability and collectability is **PROVENANCE** ***- how art ownership proceeds through time.*** The way this can be done is also through publishing books. Everyone can write their memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs, including traders, investors and art collectors. In effect, we artists can continue to be included or mentioned in even more books, without any additional effort by us.

You as an investor, reseller, trader, art collector should be able to publish a catalog with 250 works by 250 different artists, but they need to agree to this right from the start - it's your money, you should require them to follow your version of the hashtag ***#valzubiriagenda*** *parameters,* which preferably should include permission for you to publish their art. Why would you track down 250 artists later?

**No exclusive contracts**

If you're a café, you can call for artists, and come up with a book with for example, 30 artists, with a chapter devoted to each artist's profile and images of the artist's art.

You can distribute your catalogs to businesses and individuals near and far and online.

The book **Valzubiriagenda** even cites that funeral homes and janitors closets can sell art, with or without exclusivity. Airline catalogs can include million dollar art pieces. Car manufacturers, showrooms and even car repair shops can sell art as well. Everyone should be able to do this, anywhere in the world, especially not just because of the pandemic, but right now, we are in really bad economies.

**What's with the name #Valzubiriagenda**

I was into conspiracy theories in 2018, and this term, *""The Mandela Effect,""* was popular. I had read many times that an artist coined the term, but I had to research online, for her name, many times, before remembering it. I'm not good at remembering names. It took me a year and a half to finally tell you that **Fiona Broome** coined ""The Mandela Effect.""

I also thought I might have to research trademarks and copyrights just to come up with a generic name. So I decided on **""Valzubiriagenda.""** I was not really sure at first, but I decided to use it as the title for my book (with co-author/artist **Silverio Perez**) so that there would be no turning back and I can move on.

**Am I a FUTURIST?**

Someone I recently met this May 2022 just called me a futurist.

In the 1990s, I proposed to a pension fund that they can raise billions of dollars, especially for emergencies, or as needed, or out of desperation, if the pension fund purchases a quantity of art from an artist who not only has a current, reasonable price, but an announced future price that the artist wants to reach.

That future price would obviously be higher than the current price. The art commission contract for multiple art pieces can be taken to the fund's financial lender for a loan. The higher future price can be used for financing purposes.

The pension fund's treasurer, a publicly elected official, said this idea might work, but we had to keep this a secret and discuss this some more, because other pension funds might copy and do this prematurely. This idea had to come from the two of us. The treasurer needed his votes and I needed credentials.

Added into the pot was my idea that I, as the artist, will also write one book-length artist memoir. This was and still is a strong factor, because the leadership and marketing books I had read then mentioned a strong tip. If you want to advance in your field, write a full-length book that is related to the field.

Unfortunately, the elected official, the treasurer of the pension fund, who was also a friend, passed away - he was old and had ailments. At that point in time, I cannot just approach another pension fund treasurer to share this idea with.

I realized I had to write a few memoirs. I needed to set an example for other artists, so I needed to write more than one memoir. Then I felt I should also make ready another book - the how-to of what I'm up to. I wrote **Valzubiriagenda**, which was a memoir of sorts. I knew how long it would take me to write a book, so I had to make sure I can also consider this book a memoir.

In 2008, I imagined that someone like Bernie Madoff, or a fund like Lehman Brothers, would be desperate enough to use this to save themselves and their companies. I was not ready. I had only written 1 manuscript for a memoir.

In 2012, I released **Dollman the Musical, A Memoir of an Artist as a Dollmaker**. Once again, I was not ready because writing it depressed me a little, and I knew I had to write more.

In 2014, I released 3 memoirs, and re-released **Dollman the Musical.** Besides releasing regular books, I released special editions of the 4 books, which had a **""Special Secret Insert for Bankers,""** which explains my ideas of an announced schedule of exponentially increasing prices, to satisfy investors, and the publication of artist memoirs, to satisfy art collectors.

In 2014, I also issued out a press release. Google ***""Can Billion Dollar Artist Save Investors and World Economy Valentino Zubiri PRWeb August 19 2014""*** and you will see the press release.

What I did was stake a claim on my ideas. I did not promote my books and the press release. I just wanted them to stay online, like a sleeping giant or a dormant volcano. I even designed 3 of the book covers to look like indie books from the 1980s. I was planting the seeds, thinking they will eventually grow and bear fruit in the future.

In 2015, I was interviewed by **Richard Syrett,** about one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.** This book is my memoir with paranormal stories. I could have pursued promoting my paranormal stories, but I wanted to be known first as a visual artist and memoirist, so I allowed myself one interview related to **Hocus Pocus Lately. Richard Syrett** has(had?) his own syndicated radio show, **The Conspiracy Show with Richard Syrett,** about the paranormal. He also guest hosts on **Coast to Coast AM**, another internationally syndicated show about the paranormal.

In 2018, I released **Valzubiriagenda** (co-authored by artist **Silverio Perez,** a fellow artist). Finally, this book is ""the how-to of what I'm to.""

I'm going to end this with some strangeness. In 1986, a lady at a religious gathering went into a trance and left a good number of messages. Supposedly, anyone who got into a trance would have messages, but once the trance was over, the person would not remember what was said.

I was not part of the group, but the lady turned her head to face me. She ""foretold"" that whatever I would decide to do in the future, it will take time, but it will be the right thing. This is one of my stories in one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.**

**The Tulipmania of 1634-37**

I discovered that there was this incident of rare tulips becoming collectible during the Dutch Golden Age. There were tulips so rare and so well-desired that their prices equaled to that of a house. You can read more about this online (Wikipedia) or watch a few YouTube videos about it.

Here is the most useful idea that I gleaned from the Tulipmania. The tulip bulbs remained safe inside nurseries. The traders were carrying the deeds of ownership to the tulip bulbs.

**Then NFTs came to the forefront**

I started learning PHP, an HTML scripting language, and MySQL, the database that PHP can connect to in the background, in 1999, when there were only 3 books about PHP and MySQL at the bookstores.

By 2014, I was trying to figure out how to make the ""ledger,"" or database that can be used to update ownership and who can be contacted. If we are trading art, then the art ownership should be updated.

Then NFTs came about. This can be used as our ledger. Everyone can immediately trade NFTs of future, yet-to-be made art pieces, especially because it takes time to make tangible art.

NFTs actually went a step ahead, by allowing digital art to be traded.

The only setback with NFTs, in my opinion, is that it still lacks a commission system for resellers and representatives.

For example, if a café wants to represent me, then they can promote me at their café and on their online pages. If I make one piece of art that will be exclusively represented by a gallery, then that commission will be different and more specific. As ownership is transferred, the subsequent owners should be able to reset the commission. We should also have the option of giving commissions to hundreds of representatives at one time with different percentages if need be.

**The recent crypto crash**

Lately, we have observed that NFTs and cryptocurrencies have been behaving like the stock market and other markets. They have been fluctuating.

I believe that it is time for a trend which discourages fluctuation of prices.

I have also seen YouTube videos where social influencers are encouraging us to be on the lookout for exponentially profitable ventures, because we have all seen this happen with the exponential increase of Bitcoin and Ethereum.

**Let's see if #Valzubiriagenda trends**

We can announce present and future art prices. The galleries won't do this (yet?) because they follow a more traditional approach to the business of art.

*We have a choice of using* ***incrementally*** *or* ***exponentially*** *increasing prices.* We still reserve the right to change things in the future, so everyone should know to follow the latest update.

If this trends, if you as an artist simply announces that you will write an artist memoir, or that you will include the future works in future art books, you might have more art traders, investors and collectors approaching you.

**Get your pen, paper and calculator**

Imagine yourself as an artist, where you are right now. Let's just say you still do not have a book about yourself and your art yet. Imagine now that you have a memoir out there. Don't you think it makes sense to charge more than what you are charging now? Writing and publishing books is just the beginning. I'm just standardizing this approach. The books also say to do other related projects. In my case, getting **Dollman the Musical** onstage is one idea. You will have other related projects, but the publication of memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs will help all of us.

You can also imagine that a law firm that has meeting rooms, with someone who wants to form a local #valzubiriagenda group, can have meetings. A local café can do the same. Local photographers for your art, writers, editors, book designers, proofreaders and others can join in.

I suggest have printed books to share. 15 copies of your memoir or art books will be better than an e-reader or laptop or your phone to show. These gadgets can be stolen, sabotaged, broken, have coffee spilled on them, etc. 15 printed books means simultaneously showing to 15 people. You can even give them away to potential resellers, investors, traders and collectors.

**When it rains, it pours, as in the days of Noah**

There's a saying, ""When it rains, it pours."" There is a negative interpretation and a positive interpretation.

*Negative:* When trouble comes, they cascade to even more.

***Positive:*** When opportunity comes knocking, more follow suit. We can assume that if one gets our art because of #valzubiriagenda, more want to do it now, because of the rising prices, and FOMO - fear of missing out. What will they lose if they miss the boat?

As I have said earlier, if the #valzubiriagenda trends, if you announce a future memoir or art catalog, you might have an increase of investors, traders and art collectors who would want to check you out. You might encourage more sales. Just remember to write and publish that memoir and art catalog.

There's this saying, ""As in the days of Noah."" Imagine Noah, building his ark, with members of his own family, putting all his time and effort into it. Noah was a nice guy. I'm sure every once in a while a neighbor offered him coffee, or chai latte, or whatever refreshing drink they might have back then.

Here's the lesson to be learned. Just because they offered him some type of bubble tea drink, or coca cola, they still didn't make it to the ark. Rubbing shoulders with actors does not make you an actor. I have told my artist friends to write their memoirs. They told me that once they see me succeed, after all these many years of seeing my seemingly useless efforts, then they will write their memoirs and follow the road that I had paved for them.

Good luck to them, but if I were you, act now, get my art or make art. Support the 5-year old artist whose parent promised to release a comprehensive art catalog. If you get that 5-year old's art, and mine, I would be honored to be in the same art catalog that you will produce. I'm already successful at that point. You have gotten the mission just right.

I have already claimed to have written the most book-length artist memoirs in the world. Dethrone that claim. Barter. Use ghostwriters. Success to me means facing God one day and saying, I wrote my memoirs and left the world a legacy of books and art. I will not tell God, smiling and proudly, that I encouraged a run for my art by announcing a schedule of exponentially increasing prices that reached 9 figures. I'm sure God knows we had fun.

I'm an outdoorsy remote working tech bro who moved to the PNW a few years back so that I could more easily spend my free time mountain biking and snowboarding/XC skiing.

I'm also indoorsy - I love to go to the movies (I also legitimately rent movies from the last Blockbuster regularly), read indie magazines over coffee at cafes, go to an awesome monthly book club, play board games/pub trivia with my awesome friend group, see live music, and take care of my home (owning a house eats time, haha.)

1. I don't want/can't have kids
2. I don't drink or smoke so not a big party guy
3. Bend is home and I would really prefer someone who lives close-ish
4. I don't know anything about video games or anime
5. I don't like backpacking as much as I want to like backpacking. I moved to Bend so I could be outdoorsy during the day and take a shower after.

**What I'm looking for:**

Someone who would also describe themselves as fit, outdoorsy, loves alpine lakes and rivers more than ocean beaches, is a leftist, has their own goals/life, and is seeking a partnership based in love, compassion, communication, and compromise!

I'm flexible on most other things — I'm mostly just looking for a rad human who's looking for what I wrote above as well.

If that sounds like you - send me a chat! I want to know what genre of movie should we rent first and, importantly, Buttered popcorn or kettle? How do you spend your evenings in?

Let's see if we're a match. If not, I wish you all the luck trying to find your person!

I just need to get this off my chest and maybe get some advice too.

I have a new officemate. We’re not really sure about his orientation, but I think he’s straight. Still, we’ve gotten really close — it started with us joking around and playfully annoying each other at work.

One Sunday, out of nowhere, he messaged me in the morning saying he wanted to treat me to lunch at a restaurant I hadn’t tried before. We ended up spending about three hours together at the mall, just roaming around and talking.

A week later, we hung out again — had lunch, and he even helped me buy some stuff for my home. After that, we went to a coffee shop, joked around, and talked for hours. That evening, we had dinner — my treat that time, since he paid the last one.

What really surprised me was that the night before, I told him my shift would end at 9 PM (his ends at 7). He said he’d wait for me — and he really did. He waited just so we could have dinner together.

But lately, things changed. He’s been getting close with one of our woman coworkers, who also happens to be my close friend. They’ve been drinking coffee together, chatting a lot, and basically doing the same things he used to do with me.

Today’s supposed to be our day off, and that woman was working. But he still went to the office anyway — changed his timing just to wait for her.

I don’t know why, but I feel jealous. I know I probably shouldn’t, especially since I’m not even sure what he feels or if he even sees me that way. But it hurts a bit seeing him shift his attention.

I’m gay, by the way. I just needed to let this out somewhere.

I would say we are pretty experienced travellers, including our little 2.5 year old daughter. My partners family is from Europe, so we have been to visit multiple times and dealt with the jet lag, which is rough but overall a day or two back home in our routine and we are mostly over it. Hell, we even just did a trip to Europe from Canada in September-October and adjusted well on the way home.

But…Asia is a whole other story. We got back from Japan on Monday evening, and have not been able to figure out how to get back to normal. Long story short, my daughter has flipped her sleep around, so she is “napping” from 9PM-12PM and then waking up and living a whole life until we can convince her to go back to sleep at 6AM - but she wants to sleep a whole 8-9hours. We have forced her out of this routine twice to get her up for daycare (basically waking her up at like 8AM, taking her to daycare where they do a normal nap at 12PM, and then doing our normal bedtime routine at 8-9PM), but twice now she is STILL doing the shorter evening nap. 

I am currently sipping some coffee beside her while she is still sleeping (at almost 3PM) because we when to “bed” at 6:30AM. I’m totally stumped on how to get out of this cycle, as it seems even forcing the normal routine isn’t working. Any tips??

I have personally sworn off alcohol due to my behaviour and now that I’m taking my new beta blockers, I’m not allowed it anyways. I’ve been sober since September 7th. I’m very proud of myself. 

My husband is (and always was) a heavy drinker and recently his alcohol consumption has started to escalate. We used to be drinking buddies and going on brewery adventures was a fun activity for us but obviously not anymore. I’m 30F and he’s 32M for context. 

It used to be that he’d have 2-3 tall cans of an IPA in a night and a night of heavier drinking on a Friday or Saturday. He’d openly have those cans or whatever other liquor out in the house so I knew what he was drinking. I gave him shit for it and it ended up backfiring because now he’s started hiding his liquor and I only see the aftermath when it’s done or I catch him. 

This week alone he has had 2x 750ml bottles of hard liquor (that I know of) and he drinks them each in a night. He had vodka, which he was mixing with soda water on Tuesday and then last night he did the same but with white rum. I think there might be a shot left in the bottle but it’s stashed in a high cupboard so I can’t see it properly. On the in between days, he’s usually having 6-8 tall cans of some beer and a 50ml bottle of liquor. I think the only day he didn’t drink this week was Monday and that was because I needed to be driven to the cardiologist early in the morning. 

The other very concerning thing is that he’s forgoing food for liquor. We have a fridge full of food and he doesn’t eat all day and just drinks in the evenings (or throughout the day on weekends). I think he eats lunch but I’m not sure because he buys that at work. 

He’s not mean when he drinks. If anything he’s clingy and loving or very productive. This man will clean the entire kitchen from top to bottom so it puts a Mr. Clean ad to shame if you give him a six pack. 

Even though he’s not mean now, I know the trajectory for most alcoholics. They’re fun drunks until they’re not and eventually they all become mean. His dad is a great example of this. He becomes an absolute asshole to my MIL after a bunch of drinks and everything is about appeasing my FIL. I don’t want to live that life, ever. 

We can’t even do anything on weekends because he spends every morning hungover. It’s currently 1:20pm and he’s still in bed. It’s a beautiful day and while today I’m feeling under the weather with a cold, other weekends I’d love to go for a walk on one of the many trails around us, maybe go to a local craft fair or a museum, or just go out for coffee. Instead, I’m alone with the cats. 

I don’t want to give ultimatums so any advice or tips would help. We don’t have kids but would like to in the future and I don’t want them to grow up with a father who drinks that much. My own parents don’t drink at all. So until he figures himself out, that IUD will never come out. ",2,1762638367.0,AlAnon,1,1.0,False

1os1fpn,https://www.reddit.com/r/coworkerstories/comments/1os1fpn/coworker_kept_folding_up_our_ping_pong_table/,Coworker kept folding up our ping pong table,"Our building is 1/2 offices, 1/2 prototype shop & test labs. The cafeteria is in the office half. A few months ago the company bought a ping pong table for the cafeteria & it’s been a big success - gets a lot of use, including fun lunchtime tournaments. 

A few weeks after it arrived, someone started folding it up at night and pushing it to the side against the wall. It was irritating because then if someone wanted to play at lunchtime they had to spend time setting it up - every single day. First thought was maybe the cleaning crew was doing it, so the coworker who advocated for the company to buy it & organized the tournaments - we’ll call them G - put up signs saying not to fold up the table. It kept happening. G contacted the Facilities group & asked them to speak to the cleaning company, to say something to their people. Turns out it wasn’t them. It kept happening.  Table got damaged - one of the leg braces got bent. We’re engineers, so G designed some brackets that bolted on to the table - requiring wrenches to install & remove, and so the person needed wrenches to remove the brackets and fold up the table. Which they did. The brackets were found in the scrap steel bin in the prototype shop. 

Finally G got permission to hide a trail cam in the cafeteria one night. Found out that one of the lab techs was coming in at the start of his day at 4:30am, getting his free coffee from the machine in the cafeteria, and folding up the table. 

G went to the guy’s boss, who told him to knock it off. He did it again that same night, so his boss got HR involved, and now he’s on a  PIP for being insubordinate. 

TL;DR version: a guy might get fired because he didn’t want people to play ping pong at a table a very long distance from his desk.

1os1fca,https://www.reddit.com/r/CatholicWomen/comments/1os1fca/my_husbands_drinking_will_be_the_reason_we_never/,My husband’s drinking will be the reason we never have a family.,"I have personally sworn off all alcohol due to not liking how I don’t feel on control, and now that I’m taking my new beta blockers, I’m not allowed it anyways.

My husband is (and always was) a heavy drinker and recently his alcohol consumption has started to escalate. We used to be drinking buddies and going on brewery adventures was a fun activity for us but obviously not anymore. I’m 30F and he’s 32M for context. 

It used to be that he’d have 2-3 tall cans of an IPA in a night and a night of heavier drinking on a Friday or Saturday. He’d openly have those cans or whatever other liquor out in the house so I knew what he was drinking. I gave him shit for it and it ended up backfiring because now he’s started hiding his liquor and I only see the aftermath when it’s done or I catch him. 

This week alone he has had 2x 750ml bottles of hard liquor (that I know of) and he drinks them each in a night. He had vodka, which he was mixing with soda water on Tuesday and then last night he did the same but with white rum. I think there might be a shot left in the bottle but it’s stashed in a high cupboard so I can’t see it properly. On the in between days, he’s usually having 6-8 tall cans of some beer and a 50ml bottle of liquor. I think the only day he didn’t drink this week was Monday and that was because I needed to be driven to the cardiologist early in the morning. 

The other very concerning thing is that he’s forgoing food for liquor. We have a fridge full of food and he doesn’t eat all day and just drinks in the evenings (or throughout the day on weekends). I think he eats lunch but I’m not sure because he buys that at work. 

He’s not mean when he drinks. If anything he’s clingy and loving or very productive. This man will clean the entire kitchen from top to bottom so it puts a Mr. Clean ad to shame if you give him a six pack. 

Even though he’s not mean now, I know the trajectory for most alcoholics. They’re fun drunks until they’re not and eventually they all become mean. His dad is a great example of this. He becomes an absolute asshole to my MIL after a bunch of drinks and everything is about appeasing my FIL. I don’t want to live that life, ever. 

We can’t even do anything on weekends because he spends every morning hungover. It’s currently 1:20pm and he’s still in bed. It’s a beautiful day and while today I’m feeling under the weather with a cold, other weekends I’d love to go for a walk on one of the many trails around us, maybe go to a local craft fair or a museum, or just go out for coffee. Instead, I’m alone with the cats. 

Due to medical reasons I have an IUD because it’s the only thing standing between me and bleeding so heavily I need blood transfusions. So thankfully I can’t get pregnant even though being a mother is something I want. Until my husband stops drinking, I won’t even consider having it removed except to replace it. It’s not acceptable to bring a child into this. 

Please pray for me and for us. I feel like I’m getting to the end of my rope. ",4,1762638252.0,CatholicWomen,2,1.0,False

I had my internship in a different line of business than where I was placed full time, and I don’t mesh well with my colleagues for my full-time placement. For context, they are very serious, strait laced (think MBAs from Duke kind of vibe) which is a 180 from the culture of the area I interned with (I did not rank this team very high for my full time placement). 

I work with a lot of people out of the NYC office and having been NC born and raised, I am not used to the shrewd and aggressive personality. I am working in Charlotte, and the colleagues in both my office in Charlotte and NY have very high expectations and it was a lot for me to learn and adapt being so different than the internship. 

One man who is more senior in me who works in Charlotte with me is especially aggressive and holds very high expectations and wants something done one way and one way only. He has made several condescending remarks and looks for the most minor of mistakes in my work, despite the fact there are tasks I can do correctly and I’m not messing up every single thing. He has talked bad about me when I’m not at my desk, saying I was a dumb blonde and only hired for DEI metrics because I was a female, which hurt my feelings. 

In the last few months, this situation has increasingly gotten worse. I reported him anonymously to HR in May or June because he made a rude remark on the floor yelling out “You sounded so stupid over email! Isn’t this a concern?” I however believe it was not as anonymous as the report entailed, as he submitted my midyear performance feedback end of July with exaggerated and false statements regarding my performance. Our manager, who sits in NYC and has worked with this man for 10+ years, thus developing a close working relationship, believed him and I got a bad midyear review with threats of being put on a PIP by September if I did not improve. My mass job applying externally began at this very moment, as I knew there would be no coming back from this. 

Since end of July-early August, I have been micromanaged, with the more senior member in Charlotte writing down how long I’m away from my desk on paper, which freaks me out. He talked about my midyear with other coworkers on our floor, who in turn came to me and said he was spreading private details about how HR is involved and our manager is involved. When I went to my manager and said he was doing this, I was dismissed and accused of lying. In early October, the man cornered me into a conference room just me and him and made threatening comments such as “I know you have been formulating your exit plan, don’t think I don’t know what’s going on behind closed doors, “ “Don’t think I don’t know you get coffees with your friends on our floor on the other teams and they reassure you everything will be ok,” and finally, “If I were you and my career were on the line, I’d be terrified. Others who are aware of your situation I have discussed this with and I’m not naming names of who, are astonished you aren’t doing more to save yourself.” Although I documented the date, time and details of the incident, I did not submit an HR report in fear of further retaliation. 

If any good news, I am a finalist at 3 smaller banks for positions of a better fit for my personality and interests, have gotten multiple interviews back, and should be on my way out soon. Has anyone ever experienced anything like this? Is this a hostile work environment and discriminatory behavior? Please help. I have become terrified to go into work and average around 4-5 hours of sleep a night because of the anxiety of going into this job while I have submitted over 100+ job applications since August to get the heck out of here. The people I work with make me feel stupid and not smart enough to be working at the bank.

We're currently gauging interest, getting quotes for walls and other equipment, and keeping an eye out for commercial places to let.

Reasons for wet castings:

* Used coffee grounds as bedding(with proper aeration)
* Not a lot of browns (due to inexperience)



Why I'm having doubts I can fix it:

* Well, the process is done and the substrate is now all worm poop. If I add browns now, they won't really get digested...? Or if they do, the speed of turning just the browns into castings is not optimal...?

I'm an outdoorsy remote working tech bro who moved to the PNW a few years back so that I could more easily spend my free time mountain biking and snowboarding/XC skiing.

I'm also indoorsy - I love to go to the [movies](https://tinpantheater.com/) (I also legitimately rent movies from the [last Blockbuste](https://bendblockbuster.com/)r regularly), [read](https://jacobin.com/) [indie](https://www.nplusonemag.com/) [magazines](https://asteriskmag.com/) over [coffee](https://www.lonepinecoffeeroasters.com/locations-1) at [cafes](https://www.thecommonsbend.com/), go to an awesome monthly book club, play [board games](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/822/carcassonne)/pub [trivia](https://vanhenionbrewing.com/events/) with my awesome friend group, [go see live music](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5UBAfUtJ2vIptFjreQhruk?si=01d41052b22b47ce), and work on my house (owning a house eats time, haha.)   
  
Long story long: I'm a 6'5"" 210lbs remote tech bro who feels healthy after a few years of therapy, finding a community, and putting down roots in a place I love.

**A few possible deal breakers:**

1. I don't want/can't have kids
2. I don't drink or smoke so not a big party guy
3. Bend is home and I would really prefer someone who lives close-ish
4. I don't know anything about video games or anime
5. I don't like backpacking as much as I want to like backpacking. I moved to Bend so I could be outdoorsy during the day and take a shower after.

**What I'm looking for:**

Someone who would also describe themselves as fit, outdoorsy, loves alpine lakes and rivers more than ocean beaches, is a leftist, has their own goals/life, and is seeking a partnership based in love, compassion, communication, and compromise!

I'm flexible on most other things — I'm mostly just looking for a rad human who's looking for what I wrote above as well.

If that sounds like you - send me a chat! I want to know what genre of movie should we rent first and, importantly, Buttered popcorn or kettle? How do you spend your evenings in?

Let's see if we're a match. If not, I wish you all the luck trying to find your person!

Life’s been standing still for a while. I’ve been stuck in the same place, in academics, in my head, in cycles that feel endless. Change is hard, but lately, so is staying the same. Tonight however I'd like to meet a soft soul 

I’m 26, based in Italy, and either I feel everything deeply or become numb. Maybe too deeply sometimes. I care about people, about fairness, about trying to make sense of a world that often feels indifferent. I’m not here pretending to have it all figured out. I’m here hoping to meet someone who’s also just trying, thoughtfully and sincerely.

I volunteer when I can, because if I want the world to be softer, I have to take part in softening it. I believe kindness means showing up, not staying neutral. If you’re indifferent to injustice, we probably won’t connect. 

---

About me:

- 6ft | slim build | dark eyes | darker humor (especially after midnight)

- Emotionally literate and always trying. 

- Coffee, books, and quiet mornings are my comfort zone

- I like small forms of closeness.. shared music, late-night voice notes, quiet dinners, honest silences


Currently juggling work and studies. It’s chaotic, but I’m learning to find the small moments of calm inside the noise.

About you (hopefully):
You care about the world and the people in it.
You believe love is less about grand gestures and more about consistency. You’re introspective, emotionally aware, and not afraid of hard conversations or messy feelings.

Bonus points if:

- You find bookstores comforting

- You speak with honesty but lead with empathy

- You believe kindness and strength can coexist

- You value awareness over apathy


What I want:
Sincerity. 
Someone who shows up. Someone I can be soft with, who wants to build something grounded and real, even if it’s imperfect. Maybe we find peace in each other’s chaos, or maybe we just help each other breathe a little easier in the process.

If this resonates, I’d love to hear from you. Tell me who you are when no one’s watching. Share a lyric that stayed with you, a thought that won’t leave, or just say hi. You deserve a cookie for reading all the way 🍪",1,1762637733.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,2,1.0,False

I am also struggling so badly with my anxiety. I feel like I am on eggshells all the time, particularly because I am slipping quite badly and I am so worried I won't be able to pull myself out of it. Sure I talk about it, but I NEED TO START ACTIONING these words if that makes sense. For example - actually have my three snacks again, meet my energy, increase meal portions not just talk about it and say I will do it tomorrow or on Monday (an ED fav, leave it until Monday, then start). I need to also realise it probably never will feel 'right' or 'a good day to do it'. Dad is also struggling MASSIVELY with his mental health and struggling to cope, this makes me sad and anxious. I worry everything is too much for him.

I suppose some positives though are I was able to finish my shift and I enjoyed it, I managed to eat a snack and lunch at work, I bought myself a bun (it wasn't great) but I ate it! I just need to make sure I can get myself fully back on track. Yet now my ED is telling me I am gaining on this amount of food, I am looking bigger and my metabolism has adapted to this amount of food because I have left hyper-metabolism so don't need to increase ughhh. Can you tell the thoughts are getting bad again lol! Hope you all are well.

(36M/36M),"My wife (35F) and I recently moved in together, and I invited my best friend (36M) and his wife (33F) over for a small housewarming dinner.

Their recent behavior has me questioning if it’s time to finally let this friendship go.

**Some background:**

My best friend and I grew up together — high school, college, all of it. We were inseparable for years. But life happened.

He’s now an investment banker, and I’m a lawyer (not the high-paying kind). Money’s never been an issue between us, though he tends to assume I make a lot more than I do.

He came from a tougher immigrant background and built a great life for himself, which I genuinely admire. I come from a working-class family too, but with a bit more stability growing up.

He’s been with his wife since high school. I was single for a long time until I met my wife four years ago.

Over time, as they built a big social circle of other couples and work friends, I started feeling quietly left out. There were vacations, dinners, and parties that I just wasn’t invited to. I told myself it was just a “couples thing,” but it still stung — especially when his wife would play matchmaker for our other single friend, but *never me*. (Yeah, that hurt a little back then.)

They’re very social — always hosting, always surrounded by people — while my wife and I are a bit more low-key. They’re also very vocal about being DINKs (double income, no kids).

My wife and I recently had a baby boy, and since then, they’ve gotten even more distant. Part of me wonders if they might be dealing with fertility issues (they’ve been together forever and I know they’ve tried before), but that’s just a guess.



**Where things really started to hurt:**

Earlier this year, in May, I invited him for a simple coffee one weekend. He told me he wouldn’t have *any* free weekends until September. We did have a quick lunch last month. It was meh and felt like an obligation.

Meanwhile, I constantly see him hosting, meeting friends, and attending events. It’s not like he doesn’t have time — just not time for *me*.

Last summer, I planned a BBQ and invited them. They couldn’t make it — fair enough — but then they hosted *their own* BBQ the week before mine with the same crowd. It completely overshadowed my plans, and we ended up canceling ours and going to theirs instead.

His wife barely acknowledged my wife that day and seemed cold and dismissive the whole evening.



**The final straw:**

Three months ago, we invited them to our new place for a cozy housewarming dinner — just the four of us.

He called three hours before to cancel because he was “tired” after a poker night with some of our college friends and a brunch earlier that day.

For context — this guy is *never* careless like that. He’s the type who prides himself on being considerate, polished, and socially aware. Canceling last minute, especially for something trivial, was completely out of character.

No reschedule, no follow-up, no “hey, sorry again.” Just… nothing.

We’ve texted since then, but he’s completely brushed over it. No acknowledgment at all.

I’m thinking of just… slowly stepping back and letting this fade out. It feels like the message I’m getting from him is: “You’re not a priority.”



**I'm questioning the following:**

1. Does he only maintain relationships that are “useful” to him now?

2. Did he like the dynamic of being the more successful friend?

3. Or maybe he and his wife resent that I settled down and had a kid so quickly?



**TL;DR:**  
My best friend (36M) and I have drifted apart. He’s become distant, cancels last minute, and never follows up. I feel like he doesn’t value our friendship anymore, and I’m wondering if it’s time to move on.",2,1762637496.0,Advice,4,1.0,False
1os1497,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1os1497/got_a_goofy_question_about_apron_name_tape_dress/,Got a goofy question about apron + name tape dress code,"I just started volunteering at a local elementary school in their cafeteria, helping kids open their snacks, fruit cups, give them utensils they forgot to pick up, etc.

One of the coordinators told me that I should REALLY invest in an apron (as well as a few other commodities).

That weekend, I took my kid to a clothing swap meet. Lo and behold, there was a woman who previously worked at Starbucks and gave me a “Coffee Master” apron. So a trade was made and I got an apron.

This last week, the kids went absolutely bonkers over the Starbucks apron.  I’m about ass-deep in 200 orders.  I don’t even know what a “pink drink” is, y’all.  But about 50 kids kept asking for one.

Lots of funny banter, they are messing with me, I’m messing with them.  However, I had to be honest with them and tell them I have never worked at Starbucks—which I haven’t.

Which is why I’m here.

I have the [black apron with the green Coffee Master lettering](https://ebay.us/m/S1AdAp)

Is there a specific name tag that goes with this specific color and/or apron?  Is the name tag placed in a specific area?

Also, I want to 100% confuse the shit out of these kids and the people that work in the lunchroom.  Is there ANYTHING I am able to add to the apron that stands out as something like “I’ve worked at a Starbucks for a long time”, like employee award pins or employment longevity pins.

Are there shirts that only managers wear underneath the aprons that is apparently on the sleeves that would state they are managers?

EDIT:  it seems like the black clip on name tag is the current name tag.  Where’s a good place to find those?",3,1762637471.0,starbucks,1,1.0,False

Sorry. Think of it as a therapy session disguised as a confession, part dark comedy, part social commentary. A long read about corruption, silence, and fear inside a certain “prestigious” Indian university. Read if you’ve ever felt your campus teaches obedience better than education.)  
  
*By Gray Scholar from the 5th Bench, suspended somewhere between attendance and awareness. For the sake of my safety and the preservation of whatever remains of my academic life, I’ll be referring to the institution in question as “You-Know-Who.”*

*A prominent private university nestled in the heart of South India, “You-Know-Who” prides itself on glossy brochures, sprawling campuses, and promises of “global excellence.” But behind those manicured lawns and glass-panelled buildings lies a different kind of ecosystem, one that thrives not on education but on control, silence, and the subtle art of looking the other way.*  
  
*“You-Know-Who”* is the perfect example of the failures of bureaucracy and inadequacies of this nation, where corruption and vigilantism has found shelter under the disguise of education. 

  
It was the firm belief of Dr. Abdul Kalam that the future of the nation lies in the hands of the younger generation, namely students. It’s unfortunate, however the beliefs and vision of our forefathers are nothing more than tales in old history books or worse commemorative quotes. 



Now, if this sounds like *hyperbolic apocalyptic nonsense* to you, just look around yourself or better give a visit to these domesticated farms’ so-called classrooms, which are supposedly considered a temple of knowledge now often owned and controlled by the most heinous creatures of all - *demagogues indulging and bathing in political skulduggery*. 



Everyday, as I pass through these corridors and canteens within the walls of this college all I witness is *lambs and sheep being trained to obey unreservedly and often inadvertently*. *And that’s where the rot begins not in the classrooms themselves, but in the silence that surrounds them.*



Now, I understand that everyone has different experiences and different thresholds for what is and isn’t considered normal. It might sound pompous and ignorant of me to say, but what happens inside *“You-Know-Where”* is not normal. 



I am not gonna lie when I say that the majority of my life (age 0-17) was very sheltered and censored from the real ways and undercurrents of society. Upon arriving at *“You-Know-Where”* (well, not immediately, around 1.5-2 months in), I got my fair share of reality checks and shockers, truly realizing the meaning behind the words *“ignorance is bliss”.*



Now, I am not going to debate the finer intricacies of whether this was a blessing in disguise or a curse of knowledge/awareness. However, the things I want to shed light on and discuss are my experiences or rather common experiences and the collective whispers of those who breathe the same air here. And before you ask for sources for these experiences, ngl: my only response would be *“trust me, bro.”*



I call them “common experiences” because I’ve had similar private conversations with many who are aware of this darkness. They either laugh it off or accept it as the price of a degree. In fact, I’d say around 80% of the population here does (again trust me bro).  
  
***I’m done pretending it’s just a bad campus day***. 

Sorry to be the devil’s advocate but someone has to…



And don’t get me wrong… I didn't come here expecting *Hogwarts.*

But I also didn't expect *Gotham without Batman*, where the watchdogs bark only when you approach the vending machine after 9 PM, never when a knife glints in the corner or a whisper carries a threat instead of a joke.

They say a college shapes your mind.

This one teaches a very particular syllabus:



* *Stoicism, not by philosophy but by force.*
* *Survival studies, with a minor in “look away, it’s safer.”*
* *And a PhD thesis in Pretend Everything Is Fine – pass/fail, no retakes.*



Sometimes the campus breathes like it’s alive, not the good kind, not knowledge, not ambition 

but the tired wheeze of a city that once hoped and then quietly accepted compromise as culture.

You can almost hear it in the walls:



*“Silence here is not gold, it’s currency.”*



And we comply.

We watch a bus eat a life and the story dissolve like chalk in rain.

We hear laughter about machetes like it’s campus gossip, not attempted homicide.

We scroll memes about ‘chariots of death’ as if humor disinfects horror.

We see heads roll, sometimes metaphorically, sometimes… not – and shrug because the timetable still says 8:00AM class tomorrow.



You know what’s worse than fear?

**Normalization.**



When fear stops shaking your bones and instead becomes background static, like the hum of a fan. White noise of *“don’t ask,” “don't talk,” “just graduate.”*



Funny, right? 

We pay lakhs (or in Muggle currency, a small nation’s GDP) not just for education, but for an immersive psychological conditioning experience in obedient silence.



***Call it a degree in Real-World India: Deluxe Edition***.



And somewhere in the middle of the routine, morning lecture, coffee, random existential dread, side of gang rumor, a question crawls in:



*“Is this education or domestication?”*



Are we learning?

Or are we just being filed, polished, and stacked like factory products, each stamped with the same “placement-ready smile,” (perfect for the consumerist market looking for people to offer their soul)... trained to clap at orientation speeches and swallow the rest?



Maybe this post does nothing.

Maybe it’s just digital graffiti, an anonymous scribble on a bathroom stall in the internet’s basement.



But **graffiti matters**.

It says, “Someone else saw the cracks too.”



And if nothing else, writing this lets me sleep pretending, at least I tried…at least I spoke… even if only as a Harry-Potter- themed curse on bureaucracy.

Because sometimes sanity is not about changing the system, it’s about refusing to pretend it’s heaven when it smells like smoke.",1,1762637453.0,SRMUNIVERSITY,0,1.0,False

**COLD OPEN**

**INT. OFFICE – MORNING**

Joe sits at his desk surrounded by a chaotic mess of cables, sticky notes, and half-eaten donuts. A brand-new Xerox printer/copier looms beside him, flashing mysterious error lights.

**JOE (to himself)**  
How hard could this be? You plug it in, press “Copy,” and it… copies. Right?

He presses a button. The machine hums, beeps, then displays **“System Configuration Mode – Admin Access Required.”**

**JOE**  
Oh, it talks back now. Great.

He sighs and dials tech support.

**AUTOMATED VOICE (O.S.)**  
Your estimated wait time is... *forty-seven minutes.*

**JOE**  
Well, that’s about how long it took me to open the box, so… fair trade.

Cut to opening theme.



**ACT ONE**

**INT. OFFICE – LATER**

Joe finally gets through to **TANYA**, a calm, professional tech support agent who’s definitely heard it all before.

**TANYA (V.O.)**  
Thank you for calling Xerox Solutions Support. My name is Tanya. How can I assist you today?

**JOE**  
Hi Tanya, Joe here. I’ve got… a situation. My boss said I need to “initialize the firmware configuration” on the new printer.

**TANYA**  
Okay, sure. What are you seeing on the display?

**JOE**  
Uhh… something about an “admin password.” And I’d love to help, but I’m just a “user-level thinker,” if you know what I mean.



**TANYA** patiently walks Joe through connecting the printer to the office network.

Joe, meanwhile, has no idea what’s happening. He keeps her on speakerphone while he drinks coffee and nods thoughtfully.

**TANYA**  
Now click “Network Setup.”

**JOE**  
Yup, doing that right now.

(Cut to: Joe staring blankly at the screen. He hasn’t touched anything.)

**TANYA**  
Do you see the IP address?

**JOE**  
Definitely. Tons of… numbers. Everywhere.



**MONTAGE:**

* **TANYA** (still cheerful) patiently types commands via remote access.
* **JOE** takes notes like he’s learning rocket science: “Printer → Internet???”
* **Coworker (off-screen)**: “Hey Joe, how’s setup going?”
* **JOE**: “I’m delegating.”



**ACT TWO**

**INT. OFFICE – AFTERNOON**

After an hour, Tanya has fully configured the printer remotely.

**TANYA**  
Okay, Mr. Joe, everything should be up and running. Test page printed successfully.

**JOE**  
You’re amazing. Now, quick question — my boss wants a full “implementation status report.”

**TANYA**  
A report?

**JOE**  
Yeah, something I can read in a meeting so I sound like I knew what I was doing. Maybe… a paragraph with “protocols” and “network integration” sprinkled in?

**TANYA**  
(laughs) Sir, I’m not really supposed to—

**JOE**  
Tanya, please. You’ve come this far. Let’s finish strong.



Cut to: Tanya reluctantly dictating a paragraph of tech jargon while Joe writes it down word-for-word.

**TANYA**  
“The new multi-function device was integrated into the secure subnet using dynamic IP assignment via DHCP—”

**JOE**  
(while typing)  
Dynamic. So dynamic. Love it.

**TANYA**  
—allowing for real-time document management through an authenticated print server interface.

**JOE**  
Wow. My boss is gonna think I *invented* the printer.



**ACT THREE**

**INT. CONFERENCE ROOM – LATER**

Joe presents the “Printer Integration Report” to his boss and coworkers with fake confidence.

**JOE**  
As you can see, I leveraged DHCP protocols to synchronize our document environment.

**BOSS**  
Impressive, Joe. You really dove deep into the network side of things.

**JOE**  
You know me — I live for the subnet.

Just as everyone’s nodding in approval, the printer outside the conference room *beeps* and loudly says:

**PRINTER (O.S.)**  
“Configuration completed by TANYA from Xerox Support.”

The room goes silent. Joe freezes.

**JOE**  
She’s… part of my team. Remote division. Overseas.

Cue laughter.

[Interior Department releases final 2025 List of Critical Minerals | U.S. Department of the Interior](https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/interior-department-releases-final-2025-list-critical-minerals)

[Thanks Mr. N! The list has now grown to 60 minerals vital to the U.S. economy and national security that face potential risks from disrupted supply chains!](https://preview.redd.it/tzxii9q7230g1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=81ee6dcae1dd890b7a34f8645e675d7a7972d2f7)

The Department of the Interior, through the U.S. Geological Survey, today published the final 2025 List of Critical Minerals, outlining 60 minerals vital to the U.S. economy and national security that face potential risks from disrupted supply chains. 

“In 2017, President Trump set a goal of first identifying and then securing the mineral resources needed to bolster America’s economy and national security.  The 2025 List of Critical Minerals provides a clear, data-driven roadmap to reduce our dependence on foreign adversaries, expand domestic production and unleash American innovation,” said **Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum**. “By working with the mineral industry and state partners, we are ensuring that the minerals powering our energy, defense, and technology supply chains are mined and processed in the United States, which is becoming a mineral powerhouse once again.” 

The [U.S. Geological Survey](https://www.usgs.gov/programs/mineral-resources-program/science/what-are-critical-minerals-0) developed the draft 2025 List using updated methods to assess how disruptions in mineral supply could affect the U.S. economy and national security. The final List adds 10 new minerals—boron, copper, lead, metallurgical coal, phosphate, potash, rhenium, silicon, silver, and uranium—based on new data, public feedback and interagency recommendations.  

“USGS mineral science is a national asset—and the Energy Act President Trump signed in 2020 directs us to incorporate expertise from the public and from agencies outside the Department of the Interior when developing this List,” said **Andrea Travnicek, Assistant Secretary of the Interior for Water and Science**. “Industry, the public and other agencies including the Departments of Agriculture, Energy and War helped to ensure the 2025 List of Critical Minerals includes the minerals needed to protect the nation's food and energy supplies as well as defense and the economy as a whole.”  

The 2025 List marks the third List since the effort began under a 2017 Executive Order (EO 13817) directing federal agencies to strengthen mineral security. The Energy Act of 2020 requires the List to be reviewed at least every three years to reflect new data and changing supply conditions. Accordingly, the List is not static; it is intended to be dynamic and will be updated at least every two years to reflect evolving circumstances.  

Today’s publication highlights the importance of rare earth elements, a subset of critical minerals whose supply disruption would impose the highest cost on the U.S. economy, which are essential to technologies like smartphones, hard drives, and advanced defense systems. In 2024, the U.S. imported 80% of the rare earth elements it used. This year, the Trump administration has taken decisive steps to bolster our supply chains: investing in U.S. production and securing access through partners in Australia, Japan, Malaysia, and Thailand. Meanwhile, the USGS is mapping new domestic deposits and advancing the science to better understand how geology influences their quality, size, and viability for extraction.  

“This is the most comprehensive, science-based assessment yet of the minerals our nation relies on,” said **Ned Mamula, USGS director**. “Critical minerals underpin industries worth trillions of dollars, and import dependence puts key sectors at risk. This work helps secure the materials needed for U.S. economic growth and technological leadership.”

# Methodology for the 2025 List of Critical Minerals 

[What are Critical Minerals? | U.S. Geological Survey](https://www.usgs.gov/programs/mineral-resources-program/science/what-are-critical-minerals-0)

https://preview.redd.it/upp7pufo230g1.png?width=1633&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6d047d39e00c911e4b89b084a8a19f630d93f20

USGS uses data on foreign and domestic mineral production, mineral imports and exports, industry use, and other data to provide technical input for the List of Critical Minerals. Many of these data are collected and analyzed by the USGS [National Minerals Information Center](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/national-minerals-information-center). USGS reviews the methodology and updates it, as necessary, at least once every 3 years.  

USGS used an updated methodology to quantify the risks associated with potential supply chain disruptions and recommend mineral commodities for inclusion on the updated 2025 List of Critical Minerals. The updated methodology uses an economic model that the USGS developed to estimate the potential effects of foreign trade disruptions of mineral commodities on the U.S. economy.  The analysis also provides a prioritization based on the results. The economic model has several advantages over previous assessments, including the ability to directly compare the results against other economic risks and the costs of initiatives aimed at reducing the risks. A plain language summary of the methodology follows: 

1. Eighty-four mineral commodities were grouped into supply chains 
2. To determine if the impacts of trade disruption on the U.S. economy are significant, an economics effects assessment and a scenario probabilities assessment were conducted. Over 400 industries and more than 1,200 trade disruption scenarios were analyzed as part of the assessments.    
3. Each mineral commodity was then categorized by its risk of a trade disruption. A risk probability weighting was calculated by multiplying the likelihood of a scenario occurring by the impact of the scenario. If the risk was high, elevated, or moderate, the commodity was proposed for inclusion on the List.   
4. If the risk is limited, negligible, or negative, the commodity is then assessed for a single point of failure in the supply chain. If there is a single domestic producer for that commodity, it is proposed for inclusion on the List.

# NioCorp: The Strategic Basket

NioCorp’s Elk Creek Project isn’t just another mine — it’s a **national industrial base reset button**. With the U.S. defense and aerospace sector exposed to foreign choke points, Elk Creek’s mix of critical minerals lines up squarely with Pentagon and DOE priorities.

# 🔑 The Mineral Arsenal

* **Niobium (Nb)** – The *quiet giant*. From jet engines to superconductors, SMRs, and quantum systems, niobium is the alloy enabler. Elk Creek could supply a good portion — potentially all — of U.S. needs, ending dependence on Brazil.
* **Titanium (Ti & TiCl₄)** – Backbone of airframes, missiles, and armor plating. TiCl₄ doubles as a coatings precursor and is integral to stealth systems and chemical defense. A secure U.S. feedstock is essential.
* **Scandium (Sc & Sc-Al alloys)** – *The game-changer. Sc-Al alloys cut aircraft weight, extend combat radius, and enable Gen VI fighter designs. First scandium metal is targeted for November, with a DoD prime already working alongside NioCorp.*
* **Rare Earths (Nd/Pr, Dy, Tb)** – The permanent magnet core for F-35s, drones, EVs, and Navy ships. *Without them, electrification and defense propulsion grind to a halt. Elk Creek adds a U.S. stream for the most critical magnet REEs.*

# 🧭 NIOCORP: A CENTERPIECE OF AMERICA’S CRITICAL MINERALS STRATEGY

*GIVEN: \~(Nov. 7, 2025 | DOI–USGS Final 2025 List Released)\~*

“The 2025 List of Critical Minerals provides a clear, data-driven roadmap to reduce dependence on foreign adversaries, expand domestic production, and unleash American innovation.”  
— **U.S. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum**

# ⚙️ NioCorp’s Elk Creek Project — Nebraska, USA

With ""**Seven federally listed critical minerals""** and ""**Three Top-10 USGS priorities (Niobium, Dysprosium, & Terbium)""**, the **Elk Creek Project** stands as the *only U.S. mine* capable of delivering DFARS compliant, **defense-grade superalloys, permanent magnets, titanium compounds, and scandium alloys** from a single domestic source!

**""IF""** December’s assays confirm a speculative: **1 million tonne TREO** resource base, NioCorp effectively becomes the **strategic basket** for U.S. supply chain independence — cutting across **defense, aerospace, EVs, clean energy, and quantum systems.**

# ⚡ Why This Matters

Once NioCorp completes **financing and EXIM FID (Q1 2026)**, the U.S. gains more than a mine — it gains a *secure industrial base asset*.

* **Supply Chain Independence:** Eliminates reliance on China (REEs), Brazil (Nb), and Russia (Ti).
* **Vertical Integration:** From mine → advanced oxide → alloy → recycling — all domestic.
* **DFARS-Compliant Feedstock:** Enables direct DoD and DOE procurement under the new Multilateral Commercial Stockpile (MCS).
* **Generational Source:** 38+ year life-of-mine supporting SMRs, F-35s, EVs, and aerospace infrastructure.

The **U.S. Department of the Interior’s 2025 Final List of Critical Minerals** reaffirms what many in the sector have long anticipated — America is now treating mineral security as national security. With *60 listed minerals* and a call for domestic extraction, processing, and recycling, the report underscores the nation’s urgent push to reduce dependence on China, Russia, and Brazil for essential materials. At the heart of this emerging strategy sits **NioCorp’s Elk Creek Project** in Nebraska — a uniquely American development poised to deliver several of the most critical minerals on that list, including **Niobium, Scandium, Titanium, Dysprosium, Terbium, and\~ Nd/Pr**.

Elk Creek stands out because of its *multi-mineral portfolio* and *vertically integrated vision*. The project can produce **superalloy Niobium**, **Scandium-aluminum alloys**, **Titanium compounds (Ti/TiCl₄)**, and a suite of **Rare Earth Elements** vital for magnets in EVs, wind turbines, and defense systems. With **Zachry** (surface engineering) and **Dumas** (underground engineering) & others already selected as EPC partners, and **$380 million in cash on hand**, NioCorp is executing pre-construction activities while awaiting full project financing through **EXIM Bank** and allied loan guarantees. **If the final drill assays—expected by December 2025**—confirm a ""speculative"" resource expansion toward a **1 million ton TREO** case, Elk Creek’s strategic and economic valuation could significantly surpass prior feasibility models.

Beyond mining, Elk Creek represents the foundation for a **U.S.-based critical materials ecosystem**: mine-to-metal-to-alloy-to-recycling. Once financed, the project will anchor **DFARS-compliant** supply chains supporting the Pentagon, DOE, and aerospace industries. It directly aligns with federal initiatives such as the **Multilateral Commercial Stockpile (MCS)** and Defense Production Act Title III programs. **Each product stream—Nb, Sc, Ti, and REEs—serves a mission-critical role in next-generation defense systems, EV propulsion, and clean energy infrastructure.**

**- The path ahead:**

**As 2026 approaches**, NioCorp’s path is clear: complete & release final assays, file the updated **Definitive Feasibility Study**, **ESIA** and close on **EXIM FID financing**. Pending success across these milestones could rapidly elevate valuation **share** price, **reflecting its truly unique position as the only U.S. source of multiple Top-10 critical minerals.** Elk Creek isn’t just a mining project—it’s a strategic platform for **American industrial independence**, restoring domestic control over the elements that power everything from F-35s to fusion systems.

# — and it’s clear: NioCorp isn’t just about magnets. It’s part of the U.S. Critical Minerals Solution!

# — A game-changer for American Resource Independence by 2028/29 and beyond.

1os10oq,https://www.reddit.com/r/trustedhousesitters/comments/1os10oq/serious_breach_of_trust/,Serious breach of trust,"I hired a house sitter to care for my three small animals and chickens while I was away on a month-long trip to Asia. She was flying herself in from Canada and booked her ticket to arrive 3 days early. I did not like the idea of sharing the house with her, but I figured better early than late. 

I paid her $1500 upfront, (first mistake), and shortly after taking the payment, she told me she would charge for watering the 3 garden beds I had just planted.  $10 per water, and she wanted payment upfront. In her contract, she states ""I'll water plants, just tell me which ones."" 

I was shocked, and told her that she knew I was planting my garden (previously sent her photos of the seedlings) and we discussed the garden. She had ample time to tell me that it would be an extra charge, but didn't. Also, garden watering is not quantifiable as there could be rain, therefore charging for this ""service"" beforehand made no sense. If I had known she was going to charge, I would have just not planted the garden in the first place. 

Luckily, a friend who lives nearby offered to stop by twice a week and water for me. This ended up becoming a problem for the sitter. 

Part of the plan was for her to take my mom (who lives nearby and does not drive) to a golf lesson once a week. This was an extra fee, which I agreed to in advance. So, before I left, I took her to my moms place for an introduction.

I left for my trip. Had a layover in San Fransisco and get a text from the sitter saying she was having my mother over to the house for dinner. She did not ask if that was ok-she just did it! My mother has moderate cognitive decline/dementia and gets confused easily. I am her medical POA and would not have approved this, as my mom lives in a senior living facility with planned meals and she eats with her friends every meal. Its a routine that has worked well. 

I didn't make a big deal of the dinner, as my trip had just begun, and since we already had tension with the garden, I thought it best to just let that one slide. 2 days later, I get another text from her saying she was having my mother over AGAIN for dinner! At that point, I was pissed. 

My poor mom ended up thoroughly confused and called 3 people in a panic thinking she was staying the night with the sitter. My family and friends are now pulled into the frey, stressing about my mom. 

Her sense of ownership over my property became downright bizarre. She demanded that my friend (who was helping with the plants) needed to ""set up appointments"" with her, calling her a ""subcontractor"" and claiming her unscheduled visits were a security risk. Same with the guy who cuts the grass. ""I will not put my health and safety at risk"" she texted. I told her they are both trusted people, but that was not sufficient for her. She demanded a schedule. She was condecending, sarcastic, and authoritarian in her delivery. 

She told me she would need access to my printer, and that was perfectly reasonable. 

She then claimed my house was infested with fleas and she was being ""eaten alive,"" but when I asked for simple photo evidence she refused and instead demanded I order specific chemicals for her to use. She told me needed to ""treat my animals and my couch"". Her tone was authoritarian. Mind you, the animals did not have fleas before I left, so asking for photographic evidence was paramount. Her refusal to do so was infuriating. She said ""the bites on my person should be enough proof"". I reached out to the vet and had medication waiting for her to pick up and told her she needed to vacuum daily. Her reply was ""what time is your housecleaner arriving?"". I don't have a housecleaner! I told her that it was her responsibility to do that. 

  
After speaking to the local pest control company, I let her know that the house cannot be treated without photographic evidence of fleas. I live in Texas, and we have multiple bugs that can bite ankles-I explained that to her. I gave her their contact information, and told her if she needed any further clarity to contact them. 

All of the sudden, the flea crisis stopped. She did not mention it again, leading me to believe there were never fleas to begin with. Come to find out when I got home, she purchased fire ant killer-twice. 

I was stressing bigtime! Halfway around the world in Thailand, I started to think I would have to cut the trip short and go back home, as this sitter is acting like a psycho. But I played it cool so I could finish my trip. 

She’d been using my car for personal joyrides to go on hikes that were an hour away. I had to let her know that was not appropriate, and the car was for groceries and pet needs.  She put 1000 miles on my car in a month! She volunteered at a thrift store 25 minutes away and started taking care of someone's horse somewhere else.  

On the third week of the trip, I receive a text from her saying she's ""having the neighbors over for dinner"". WHAT? WHICH NEIGHBORS? Why was this not approved by me? I ask, and she tells me which neighbors, who I like. I see on the Ring camera them coming over. The next day, I call that neighbor to let her know I've been having issues with the sitter, get an update on the house, and come to find out, the sitter not only invited them (a couple) but also 2 other people!!! She was trying to host a dinner party in my home ffs! 

Before I arrived home, she sends me a video of the house. My mothers jacket was draped over a chair and she said she went into my moms closet to ""borrow"" the jacket as she was chilly. WHAAAT?

She never once sent me photos of my chickens, and days (like up to 6 days) would go by without any pet photos. At one point she called me a ""newbie"" which I found offensive, and that term coupled with the fact she didn't even send pet updates was quite ironic. 

I finally arrived home and she was off to a Motel 8. I find towels and dishes on the counter that she hand washed and laid out to dry. My black granite countertops now have water damage. I wrote to her and her reply was a flippant ""oh just use the lemon spray and wipe them...they'll be fine"". Citrus is the LAST thing to use on granite as it is way too acidic. But I'm the newbie, right?

The $100 petty cash had all been used. She left $8. After reviewing the receipts, I see the 2 purchases for fire ant killer. This is my guess as to why her ankles had bites, because she never once proved there were fleas in the house. 

There was one bottle of water in the fridge. I had left her with 3, five gallon jugs of water, and at least 20 small bottles of water in the fridge. So, upon waking, I had to go to the store to get water for my coffee. Mind you, I spent hundreds of dollars stocking the place with food and drink, because I'm hospitable that way. She leaves me without basic water. 

This whole ordeal was a nightmare, I was super stressed the entire trip, and it was a huge lesson to better vet any potential house sitters in the future. 

I will be contacting my credit card company to request a chargeback on her ""services"" as she breached the contract in so many ways. ",0,1762637219.0,trustedhousesitters,19,0.29,False

I’ve been sober since September 7th. I’m very proud of myself. 

My husband is (and always was) a heavy drinker and recently his alcohol consumption has started to escalate. We used to be drinking buddies and going on brewery adventures was a fun activity for us but obviously not anymore. I’m 30F and he’s 32M for context. 

It used to be that he’d have 2-3 tall cans of an IPA in a night and a night of heavier drinking on a Friday or Saturday. He’d openly have those cans or whatever other liquor out in the house so I knew what he was drinking. I gave him shit for it and it ended up backfiring because now he’s started hiding his liquor and I only see the aftermath when it’s done or I catch him. 

This week alone he has had 2x 750ml bottles of hard liquor (that I know of) and he drinks them each in a night. He had vodka, which he was mixing with soda water on Tuesday and then last night he did the same but with white rum. I think there might be a shot left in the bottle but it’s stashed in a high cupboard so I can’t see it properly. On the in between days, he’s usually having 6-8 tall cans of some beer and a 50ml bottle of liquor. I think the only day he didn’t drink this week was Monday and that was because I needed to be driven to the cardiologist early in the morning. 

The other very concerning thing is that he’s forgoing food for liquor. We have a fridge full of food and he doesn’t eat all day and just drinks in the evenings (or throughout the day on weekends). I think he eats lunch but I’m not sure because he buys that at work. 

He’s not mean when he drinks. If anything he’s clingy and loving or very productive. This man will clean the entire kitchen from top to bottom so it puts a Mr. Clean ad to shame if you give him a six pack. 

Even though he’s not mean now, I know the trajectory for most alcoholics. They’re fun drunks until they’re not and eventually they all become mean. His dad is a great example of this. He becomes an absolute asshole to my MIL after a bunch of drinks and everything is about appeasing my FIL. I don’t want to live that life, ever. 

We can’t even do anything on weekends because he spends every morning hungover. It’s currently 1:20pm and he’s still in bed. It’s a beautiful day and while today I’m feeling under the weather with a cold, other weekends I’d love to go for a walk on one of the many trails around us, maybe go to a local craft fair or a museum, or just go out for coffee. Instead, I’m alone with the cats. 

So basically, Reddit, I need help. I don’t want to give ultimatums so any advice or tips would help. We don’t have kids but would like to in the future and I don’t want them to grow up with a father who drinks that much. My own parents don’t drink at all. ",1,1762637203.0,stopdrinking,15,0.67,False

- **L’Oréal Elvive Lamellar Water**  

**Now I’m looking for more recommendations for:**  
✨ **Haircare:** shampoos, masks, serums, heat protectants, bond repair products, sprays, etc.  
🧴 **Skincare:** cleansers, serums, moisturizers, spot treatments, body-care for body acne, eye creams  
💄 **Makeup:** affordable but good blushes, lip tints, matte/liquid lipsticks, tinted balms, etc.  
   - *Preference for lipstick:* Either a **nude-beige or nude colour**, or a **really dark lipstick** like coffee/espresso colour  
💍 **Extras:** hair dyes, electric shaver, septum rings, earring stacks, small accessories worth bringing  

Basically, things that are **better/cheaper in the US than in India**, or cult products that are **hard to find here**.  

I know there are a bunch of **sales going on right now**, but since she needs to order by the **10th–15th**, I’m trying to finalise my list soon.  

Please drop your **favourite recommendations** or **must-haves** that you swear by from US drugstores or Ulta/Target/Walmart. 🙏

Hey everyone,

Been thinking a lot lately about that feeling of being stuck in a rut. You know the one—where the days blend together and you feel like you're just running on a hamster wheel, not actually *leveling up*.

It's easy to think we need some massive, life-altering change. But honestly, I've found the biggest gains come from tiny, daily optimizations. Small shifts that add up to huge momentum.

Here are a few **daily hacks** that have been a game-changer for me, maybe they'll help you too:

*   **The 2-Minute Tidy.** Before you leave a room (your office, your bedroom, the kitchen), spend just two minutes putting things back where they belong. It’s insane how much this reduces background stress and makes your environment feel more manageable. It's a tiny deposit into your ""future peace of mind"" bank.

*   **Schedule a ""Do Nothing"" Block.** Sounds counterintuitive for productivity, right? But scheduling 15 minutes to literally just stare out the window, listen to a song without multitasking, or just sit in silence is like a hard reset for your brain. It stops the burnout train in its tracks and often leads to your best ideas.

*   **Win the First Hour.** I'm not gonna tell you to wake up at 4 AM and run a marathon. But what if you protected the first hour of your day from your phone? No emails, no social media, no news. Just you. Make coffee. Stretch. Journal one sentence. This small act of intention sets the tone for a day *you* control, not one that controls you.

*   **The ""Energy Audit"" Question.** A few times a day, just pause and ask: **""What's one thing I can do *right now* to feel 1% better?""** Sometimes the answer is chugging a glass of water. Sometimes it's stepping outside for 60 seconds of sun. Sometimes it's closing a dozen browser tabs. It pulls you out of autopilot and back into the driver's seat.

And look, sometimes the biggest ""hack"" isn't a hack at all. It's about getting your head right. We can optimize our calendars and to-do lists all day, but if the emotional engine is sputtering, we're not going anywhere. If you feel like the mental and emotional side of things is what's really holding you back, and you need a more structured approach to navigating it, I found **this resource (affiliate link)** really helpful for building a better internal game plan.

It's all about building a system that supports you, not just pushes you.

What are your go-to daily optimizations? The small things that make a real difference in your productivity and happiness? Let's share some ideas.",1,1762636866.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

I’m relatively new to this subreddit, but not entirely new to penpaling. I’ve always enjoyed the idea of connecting with people through handwritten letters, and now I’m hoping to take that a step further.

In an effort to make new friends, explore a meaningful hobby, and interact with interesting folks from different walks of life, I came up with the idea of starting a shared journal. The concept is simple: I write in a physical journal, mail it to you, you write your thoughts or stories, and then mail it back. Over time, we build a kind of co-authored book, full of reflections, humor, memories, and whatever else we feel like sharing.

After a quick Google search, I realized this isn’t a brand-new idea, but it’s new to me, and I’d love to give it a try. So, I’m putting this out there… is anyone interested in joining me?

Ideally, I’m looking for two penpals to exchange journals with. I’d prefer folks outside the Pacific Northwest, since that’s the region that I call home. I’m genuinely curious to learn about different regions, cultures, and perspectives.

I love the idea of having something shared that you can doodle in, attach things to, get coffee stains on, and “live” through. If this sounds like something you’d enjoy, feel free to reach out! I’m excited to see where this journey might lead.",2,1762636795.0,penpals,0,1.0,False

I (23) met a girl while hiking a while ago. We exchanged Instagrams and later went for a walk together. it lasted about 90 minutes, and I really liked her vibe. She asked me lots of questions as well. 
After that, I got busy with travel and uni stuff, so I didn’t reach out for a while. We go to different universities and live kind of far apart, so it’s not easy to bump into her.
Recently I messaged her again and asked if she wanted to grab coffee. I didn’t explicitly call it a date i just asked if she’d like to hang out and she said yes.

Now I’m wondering, should I treat this as a proper date or more like a casual catch-up? I’m interested in her and would like to take one step beyond friendship, but I’m not sure how to approach it without making things awkward.

1os0rar,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1os0rar/i_need_help_moving_on/,I need help moving on,"So I(18M) was in love with the daughter(F15) of my mother's friend from 2020 to 2024.

What opened my eyes was when we traveled together, she made it very clear that she doesn't like me, as in random insults, disagreeing and trying to shut me up at every opportunity, and so much more.

I never thought that she liked me back, but the confirmation in that trip that she didn't like me, that hurt me deeply.

I got back home heartbroken, and on top of that I had to join the military for a year, as per my country's rules.

Came back from that completely feeling void of emotions for her, something I hadn't felt in a long time, just nothing, no care at all.

It was good, until recently, we were going out to an amusement park, something that reminds me of the day I fell in love with her.

That day we were also going to an amusement park, and I didn't really think much about her, but that day changed everything.

We had so much fun, I started feeling a little spark in my heart, then our mother's sent us alone to go to a Chinese restaurant only we wanted to eat from.

When we got far where they can't see us, she said ""hold my hand"" and smiled at me and we walked there, that smile, I don't know if I'll ever forget it.

We walked, we reached the restaurant, had fun and ate and all, we head back also holding hands, all of a sudden we start talking about animals and such, I mention how apes usually carry their kids on their back, she says ""why don't we try that?"" So I carry her on my back and run back to where our mothers said they would be, of course we would stop and walk normally as to not to raise suspicion.

Since then, I was completely in love, I really wished she felt the same, but she never did.

Anyways, fast forward to the recent amusement park trip, I go out with my mother, accompanying us was her, her brother and mom.

I talk to her brother, cuz he was my best friend even before I loved her, keep in mind it was a while they didn't see me since that trip.

So I have fun with her brother, as usual, ignoring her and she's doing the same, all of a sudden, we slowly start hitting it off again, just like old times, chatting, laughing and joking around, but nothing romantic since our mothers are around.

We sat down at a restaurant there, and we started chatting, mostly me and her and our mothers are just listening to us, we talk about redbull (our favourite drink) and I tell a joke about how we always have the same favourite stuff, she laughs and smiles at me.

That smile, it reminded me heavily of the first day I liked her, I couldn't not see it.

I know this sounds like an anime moment, but I swear I just looked at her for a second and imagined that day all over again, and she was confused that I was looking at her smiling, but not saying anything, she said ""You ok?"" And I was like ""oh, yeah this redbull is hitting hard"".

Since that day, I have been remembering her every day and feeling like I miss her, like I'm in love again.

I don't know how I can move on after such memories, it's very sad that I can't do anything about it.

That's not even the saddest part.

One day, before that last time I went out with her, I go out with my brother(20M) for coffee, and to chat, cuz we're bored at home.

So he parks infront of the house, and as I was exiting, he says ""You still in love with that girl?""

I say ""Nah man, the feelings I have are gone now, I don't feel anything"" I felt like that when came back from the military, and this was recently after it, I was not lying.

He says ""Good, can I tell you something?"" I say ""Sure what's up?"".

He says ""Look, me and mom, we knew you loved from the beginning, before you even talked to me about it, when we went out together, you stared at her for long periods, you were very noticeable.""

""I was that obvious huh?"" I said, ""Yeah bro, but that's not what I want to tell you, I just don't want to hurt you or anything."" I said ""bro spell it out.""

He said ""Look, why do you think, all these years, she was nice to you? She treated you differently, she wanted to be your friend, not your love.""

""What are you trying to say"" I said.

""She loved me"" he said.

I didn't know what to feel when I heard that, all these 4 years, it was all to befriend me?

""She digged up for my snap, even though she doesn't even have my number, she texted me and tried to talk to me everyday, she even confessed love to me once, what I replied to her with was no, I like you as my little sister, nothing more than that.""

I was so confused, I felt like I was the stupidest person alive.

""And in that trip you guys went on, you said she hated you? That your eyes were opened? Well, that was because we had that conversation prior to you guys going.""

I don't hate my brother, I always made sure I never love her more than him, and hearing that all of this happened behind my back, that I was just being played, I was never so glad before that I have a good brother like mine.

Now, the real problem is, even though I know all this, when I went out with her on that last visit to the amusement park, and saw her smile again, I was reminded of all of that nevertheless, I fell in back in love again, but it got me thinking.

Why is she like that again? What's the point now? Am I her plan B? Is she still trying to befriend me for my brother?

I'm so confused, but at the same, I still love her, for some reason.

I know it's wrong, I don't want to love her, I want to move on, but it seems like it'll never happen.

I really need to know, how can I move on? It just seems like the more I think of her, the more I go back to loving her, and I don't want that, but I just can't get her out of my head for some reason, it's like I'm cursed or something.

If you read all the way to here, thank you, I really hope you will give me some advice on all this, I'm happy I got this off my mind, but now I need to know, what should I be doing to forget her? To make sure I don't fall into that trap again?

2. When Life Gives You Tangerines - Watched this gem with my mom, and we finished I was sobbing for Gwan-sik by the end. I don’t even have words for how much I love his character; honestly, I love him even more than Ae-sun.

3. Goblin — I still remember watching it as a teenager and ugly crying over how Kim Shin had to live alone without her. Everyone I’ve recommended it to says it’s a bit slow or boring, but for me, it’s something really special. I’ve rewatched it four times and loved it every single time. The OST? Absolute perfection. This show is truly one of a kind. And honestly, I still haven’t gotten over Gong Yoo’s smile, lol.

4. Mr. Plankton - I’ve never been this blown away by the cinematography of a show. While I’ve come across beautiful visuals before, none have been as breathtaking as this. The show was quite out of my comfort zone, as I don’t usually enjoy offbeat dramas, yet it completely captivated me. I’d been craving to watch Woo Do-hwan in romance genre again after Tempted. He was brilliant in that show and in everything else he’s done. For me, this one was more about the characters than the story because the cast was phenomenal — every character felt so real. And to top it off, the chemistry between the leads was simply undeniable.

5. The Good Bad Mother – I was honestly amazed by this show. My absolute favourite moments were whenever Kang Ho (the MMC) and Mi Joo (the FMC) were on screen together, and of course, Kang Ho with the kids — I just couldn’t get enough of those four. The story kept me hooked from start to finish; it was so binge-worthy. I’ve watched it twice already, no skips, not a single dull moment.

6. The Glory - I honestly have no words for this show. For someone as talkative as me, it’s rare to be left speechless, but this one truly did it. It overwhelmed me so deeply that I haven’t been able to bring myself to watch it again — I just can’t go through those emotions and tears once more. I even made my mom watch it, and she loved it so much that she’s seen it three times. It’s become her absolute favorite show.

The Cocokind Retinol gel for beginners has good reviews. I’m planning to start tret (I got Obagi tret from my derm) but I’ve been nervous to start so this could be my stepping stone. It was ~$19 on sale.

I hit my GW on October 1st which was at the high end of healthy on a bmi chart. My plan has been to let my body settle into a comfortable weight on its own and then start playing with maintenance either by lowering dose or stretching them out. Or both I guess.

Last week was my 1st compound dose. I had been at 9/9.25ish on Lilly so I just moved it to 10 for ease. Not a lot of impact from that. Started to see my hunger increase. Not bad but faster than I'm ready for. So yesterday I moved to 11. Bam! Hit me like when I started.

Almost made it to 1k calories yesterday but not quite. Today I had some fiber gummies and an apple so far. Its 1pm, i've gone for a run, had a cup of coffee, and still not hungry. Wow.

Anyway, just ""saying that out loud.""

This has happened to me with almost every dose increase and I know how to handle it. Don't need advice just musing. Its just been a while since I felt this big a hit.

1os0nan,https://www.reddit.com/r/nespresso/comments/1os0nan/nespresso_lattissima_pro_stuck_in_descaling_with/,Nespresso Lattissima Pro Stuck in Descaling? (With fix!),"Hi. Is your Nespresso Lattissima Pro Stuck in Descaling?

Mine sure was. See if this describes your symptoms and you can try my fix

I have a Lattissima Pro I picked up from someone on a classifieds deal. I thought sensibly to run descale mode as it was a bit dirty and was showing scale. I didn't even try to run a cup through it first, just tried to descale. Very similar to what u/Kris_one982 reported in \[1\].

The unit turned on, pump started running, started running the descale mode, spit out a little bit of water, and then stopped and said Descale Mode Not Finished. From there my only option was to try and exit, which didn't help, or retry descale.

Retrying descale, the unit would start the pump running for a few seconds, and then stop saying descaling not finished...

I presumed that the problem was very similar to what was reported in \[2\], that maybe the pump wasn't primed, and it wasn't running long enough to be primed, or that the filter was stuck. \[3\] describes steps that other models were recovered using and helped inform me.

If this describes your unit, read on.

I can't tell you exactly what fixed it, but I can tell you steps I did to reboot mine.

First, I used tweasers to pry loose the filter from the back and cleaned it completely. It's not easy to get out. You have to bend it a little bit.

Then I looked for any debris under the filter, and didn't find any. I then filled the small space with water. I held a strong magnet in what I thought was the same location as the float magnet from the reservoir. I then tried the instructions from \[3\] to run the descaling cycle over and over. The water would move a little but ultimately didn't go down.

I then grabbed my Dewalt air inflator, used the side for blowing up pool toys, and put pressurized air into it, which ended up removing most of the water blown away before I got it in the hole. I then tried to run the descale cycle with while holding the blower in the hole and the magnet against the back. I tried maybe 3 times and then the pump made a very different sound this time!

Ok. Interesting. Next step. I kept the filter out, magnet held in place, and the reservoir off, and poured a small amount of water in the back and started the cycle. Almost no flow but it did take some in before saying it was not finished. Then I tried again, and this time I had to be ready to pour a little more water in the back. I kept going until I had about 3 thimbles full of water into the pump and it started coming out the front. Wow I said and quickly powered it off.

Then I put the filter back in, it involves bending it a bit into a U shape and sliding it over the lop and into the washer slot. Once I did this, I re-attached the water reservoir with plain old water, and Eureka, it run a full descale cycle. I then put in descaler and ran a full cycle. Now it makes coffee.

I hope this helps you rescue your machine and prevents it from turning into ewaste.

**Now The Challenge:** Small and medium businesses often struggle with efficiency, customer engagement, and staying competitive. Manual processes waste time, and scaling without high costs seems impossible.  
  
**The Solution:** AI is accessible beyond tech giants. It automates repetitive tasks, personalizes customer experiences, saves time, cuts costs, and boosts revenue.  
  
**Real-World Example**: Brewed Awakening, a small coffee shop chain, integrated an AI-powered chatbot for online orders and customer service. Results:   
1) 30% faster order processing  
2) 20% increase in customer satisfaction  
3) 15% boost in repeat orders through personalized recommendations  
  
**How AI Helps Your Business:**  
1) Automation: Streamlines inventory, payroll, and scheduling.  
2) Insights: Predicts trends with data analytics (e.g., top-selling products).  
3) Engagement: AI chatbots and targeted marketing retain customers.  
4) Scalability: Grow without operational bottlenecks.  
  
**The Big Picture:** A 2024 McKinsey report found 70% of businesses adopting AI saw revenue growth, and 63% reduced operational costs. Competitors ignoring AI risk becoming obsolete, like Blockbuster against Netflix.  
  
**Take Action:** Start small with AI tools like chatbots (e.g., Tidio), analytics platforms (e.g., Google Analytics 4 with AI insights), or marketing automation (e.g., HubSpot). Most offer free trials.  
  
**The Bottom Line:** AI is not the future, it’s the present. Adopt it to stay efficient, smart, and competitive. Don’t let your business fall behind.

In September, my gf moved 4 hours away to complete a postgraduate degree which will last a year. 

Since her moving away, I have travelled down twice to go see her. One of these times I took public transport and the second time I drove down. I would aim to see her more if travel expenses weren’t so high and I was earning more money. 

She has came back home once since she has been away to attend a family wedding, as her parents still don’t know about me due to personal reasons I was not invited and during this trip I didn’t see her at all. Which honestly sucked but I understood as she was only visiting home for the wedding. 

Now, she is planning a trip home for a weekend (arriving late Friday night and leaving early Monday morning). This has prompted an argument between us as I asked if she would be making time for us to meet up.

In my eyes, if the situation was reversed I would plan time to see her. However, her view point is that she has seen me recently but not seen her family since the last time she visited home. 

I completely understand her missing her family and wanting to spend time with them but it hurts that she won’t even take an hour to come meet me for a coffee.

When I told her this she told me her initial plan was to leave Sunday and meet me before leaving but as she is now leaving Monday this is not possible as I will be at work.

Part of me feels like a complete selfish asshole for wanting her to make some time to see me but another part of me is really pissed off as I I’d make time for her if the roles where reversed and would utilise the time where we are both in the same city to meet up at least once.

I primed a week ago, masonry sand mixed into Zinsser’s no-voc primer. Yesterday I did one coat- it was pretty streaky, and there were small bubbles throughout. (Photo 1)

Today I’m attempting a second coat. I was concerned yesterday that it was too stiff, but today’s mix is so wet it’s falling off my hawk and float. (I mixed it last night and left it to hydrate.)

When I came in there were small vertical cracks EVERYWHERE. (Photos 2&3) I’m applying my second coat now and there are tons of bubbles, many quite large. (Photos 4&5) I read in another thread to go have a coffee and then come back and trowel again, but how is that going to release the bubbles? Is it implied that you scrape off the first coat after the coffee and redo it, or something about going over it again makes the bubbles disappear? (That would seem to defy the laws of physics, but what do I know?)

I sprayed water several times over each section before my second coat. I’m trying to keep my application super thin. I have a small amount of experience applying lime plaster, and fiber rich clay plaster over cob, but never a fine plaster like this. 

I’ve been gently working it with a sponge to try to get a relatively smooth surface, but that’s obviously not helping with the bubbles, which I assume will cause failure at some point. I really need to get this in a relatively decent state soon, I have clients coming in on Monday, and it’s pretty embarrassing as it is now.

Dan gets out of bed and snuffs out the candles. They are to exhausted to take a shower. He pulls the covers over Amy and slides in as the big spoon to her little spoon. His semi erect cock finding it’s was between her ass cheeks. It draws a moan that lets him know he has hit the right spot. They drift off to sleep. 

Dan rolls over and realizes there is no Amy, it’s three in the morning. The shower turns on. Amy comes back to the bed.  

“Daddy are you awake.”

“Barely what do you need?”

“There is something wrong in the shower and I need your help to fix it.”

“For Christ’s sake can it wait till morning.”

“No! This needs fixed ASAP!” 

“Well shit.” Dan slowly crawls out of bed and into the bathroom. Amy pushes him in and closes the door. “What’s the problem?”

“You see, Daddy kept poking me in the ass all night and made me so horny, I couldn’t sleep. His cock was in my ass last and he needs to be cleaned up before he takes care of me again.” 

Dan smirks at Amy. “Well that is a problem. I’ll see what I can do to fix it.” She leads him into the shower. Dan pulls her in for a kiss as the water cascades over their naked bodies. This feels like it needs to be slow and romantic. He gets thoroughly washed and it feels wonderful.  

“Daddy it’s time to fix the the problem. Please?” Amy gets washed thoughtfully.  Plenty of time was taken to make sure she was properly cared for.  Playing with the nipples, kissing and teasing them brings her to the edge. She was still wearing the collar which made it even sexier. When he finally reached down to rub her kitty, she orgasimed so hard she had to hang on to his neck to stay upright. After she could stand he spun her around and made her bend over at the waist. She had been manhandled before, but this was different Daddy was in complete control. He had nothing to prove. This was just the two of them communicating through sex. He slowly and gently moved in and out of her. So confident in every stroke. She could feel herself getting close. 

“Oh Daddy cum with me!” Two more pumps and she went limp as they climaxed together. 

Dan wrapped Amy in a fluffy white robe and slipped into one himself. They returned to bed. Amy playfully pushed him onto his back in the middle of the bed.  She took off her robe and threw it on the floor. The other robe quickly joined it. Amy layed on the Silver Fox’s chest. 

“Daddy please don’t think when I say I love you that I mean a white house, three kids, two dogs and a mini van. I mean, how you make me feel, like I’m the most important person in your world at that second. Love you Daddy.” She knew in her heart that was a lie. 

“Love you too Baby Girl.”

The alarm goes off at seven and they spring into action.  Dan goes to the kitchen and starts the coffee. Amy puts on her favorite shirt of Dan’s. Throws her hair in a messy bun. Checks the reflection in the bathroom mirror and thinks to herself happiness is the best make up. Time to make the biscuits.

Dan is just about done making the calf bottle and about to head out into the cool spring morning to feed the animals. Walks up to Amy puts her in a bear hug planting a big kiss on her. “Love you baby girl.”Heading to the garage door to head outside. “Oh and Amy.” 

She spins around holding the plastic bowl she was getting out of the cupboard to mix the biscuits in. 

“When I say I love you, I mean the white house, 3 kids, 2 dogs and the mini van type.” 

Amy drops the bowl to the floor and it bounces away. Dan smirks and heads out the door. 

Amy picks up the bowl and starts mixing the dry ingredients. Her mind races. Did he know she was lying last night or was he just being honest. She decided it didn’t matter. He said it first. 

Amy finished putting the biscuits in the oven as a perky voice catches her by surprise. 

“Need some help?” Kayla asked.

Amy gives her a big hug,”I’ll always take help cutting up apples.” They make small talk and get to know each other a little better. “Could you get a couple more apples out of the refrigerator?”

As Kayla walks over to the refrigerator she can see into the den.  “Someone had fun in the den last night!” She can see a dress laying in a pile on the floor. A suit coat men’s shoes and socks also laid there. A dress shirt was laying on the floor at the door way. 

“Yes we did.” Amy replied without a hint of regret. 

“ Well it couldn’t have been much fun. No underwear is laying here.”

“That’s because we don’t wear underwear.” Kayla starts to get uncomfortable. “I really don’t know how I’m going to sit for an hour at church.” Amy says, trying to get a reaction.  

That breaks Kayla “Oh gross you and Dad did the back door nasty!”

Amy starts laughing and hugs Kayla who starts laughing too. 

“You’re lucky to have him as a Father. He is an awesome guy!”

Kayla laughs “I know, we just can’t let Dad know that!”

“Oh and his name is Daddy not Dad.”

“Amy I didn’t need to know that! That’s TMI!! Oh shit, so what’s your pet name? Babe? Kitten? Come on don’t leave a girl wondering.”

“Baby Girl.”

“Amy I don’t want to know this stuff! Old people having sex is gross!”

“I’m only ten years older than you! I’m not old!”

Laughing they head back to the kitchen to finish cutting up apples and get the crisp baking.  

“Kayla come help me pick out a dress for church it has to be cute but not overtly sexy but can’t look like a prude.” As the two of them walk into the bedroom. The two robes are laying on the floor along with Dan’s suit pants her heels. His tie is hanging from the head board. The bed was unmade of coarse. 

Kayla gasps. “Well this doesn’t look at all like a porno was shot here!” Amy turns bright red. 

“Kayla, there’s been no one in your Dad’s life since since your mom passed and it has been almost two years for me. We are enjoying each other’s company.”

Kayla laughs. “Amy with the afterglow you have going on everyone is going to know you and Dad are doing the nasty.” They both laugh. 

Amy goes into the bathroom and slips on her favorite sun dress from last summer and her favorite pair of sandals. To tone it down she puts a cardigan over the top. She walks out and strikes a model pose. “How do I look?”

“Oh my perfect! And that necklace is such a statement piece.”

Amy blushes, “It’s an infinitely collar.”

Kayla panics “ You and Dad aren’t into that are you?”

“No it’s just a statement piece to me. I’m not his sub!” Now go get ready and you can ride to church with us.” 

They hug and Kayla heads to her room. As she walks out, Amy thinks to herself that’s lie number two I’ve told today.  

Dan comes back into the house. Amy is putting the final touches on the food. Sliding up behind her, he starts to nibble on her neck. 

“Stop it! Your daughter is in the basement getting ready. She already thinks the house looks like a porno was shot here last night.” Dan stands up looking into the den then the bedroom, clothes lying all over. 

“Yeah it does! Damn I’m proud of that.” Grinning ear to ear. 

“Ass hole!” Slapping him on the chest, then standing on her tip toes and kisses him deeply. 

“Just get a room you two!” Kayla says giggling. 

“Go take a shower and get dressed. We will load up the Jeep.” As Dan turns to head to the bedroom, Amy gives his a swat on the bum. 

“You two are terrible!” Kayla says rolling her eyes. 

The two girls are in the Jeep, food packed ready to leave. When Dan opens the door to the garage He’s wearing a sport coat and jeans looking every bit of a Silver Fox. 

Amy squeaks. She thinks to herself, “ now I’m wet again, damn him”

Kayla heard her, “Cleans up pretty good for an old guy!” Then starts laughing. Amy can’t help but laugh too. 

“What’s so funny?” Dan asks. Sliding into the Jeep. 

“Just girl talk.” Amy says trying not to be suspicious.  

They chat on the way to church and leave the food in the Jeep and head inside. They no more than get in the door “Grandpa” echoes out. And a little 3 year old girl runs and jumps into Dan’s arms. He does a spin with her and stops in front of Amy. 

“Katie Bug this is my friend Amy. Amy this is Katie Bug.”

“Grandpa she looks like a princess!” Katie exclaims. As Amy blushes. 

“Yes she does Katie Bug!” With a not so subtle wink. 

She kicks to get down and walks up to Amy. “I have a twirly dress!” And does a spin as the skirt flairs out. “Do you have a twirly dress Amy?” Amy looks at Dan and smiles.

**TEMPEST IN A TEACUP (REVISITED) (Russian black tea, shattered bone china, the ozone of passing thunderclouds, and rain-damp suede.)** I remember liking this one but I got a better idea of what notes I like now. In the vial: citrusy, almost fresh ozonic. On the skin: definitely a black tea base, not as powerful as bitter as in Persian Tea Room, but it is there as an almost metallic backdrop. The ozone and citrus are the clearest - I think they use citrus for “bone china” for whatever reason. To me it isn't quite like bergamot oil, it's a bit more juicy and fresh, tart and astringent rather than sweet and balsamic. This is more of a fresh citrusy scent than I remembered, almost green, like lemon verbena tea. Wish the tea was stronger, but then again, that’s why I FSed Persian Tea Room. Just a bit unremarkable, might be interesting if you like freshies and want something with a bit more. Downgraded to a **6/10**, it's fine.

**INCANTATION CACAO (REVISITED) (raw cacao, sacred Atlas cedar, vetiver root, quebracho tanned suede, green cardamon, orris root, red Rooibos chai, bitter orange, Palo Santo, and acacia flowers.)** In the vial: a pleasant cacao, not sweet but not too powdery. On the skin: mm, that is a very balanced cacao. It’s smooth and a bit sweet but definitely has a wooden base, some Rooibos herbals (not fresh greens, it’s that almost tobacco-y note Rooibos has, just greener). Definitely not a “chocolate milk” scent, though there is some creaminess, but I find the cacao less powdery than before resting. The most top notes, the orange and flowers, do brighten this up a bit but they are very faint - the background vetiver and cedar are similarly faint. But these combined with the stars of the show (cacao and rooibos, a bit of leather, some dusty cardamom) definitely make this a more wearable, sophisticated version of what could’ve been a more straightforward gourmand. Definitely masculine, but not overly - it’s not cologne. It’s sophisticated, I’d feel put together smelling like this while still definitely smelling a lot like CACAO. **8/10** from the previous 7/10, not higher because I am not obsessed and I wish the leather was a tad stronger, but it’s a very nice one. I don’t think it changed too much from resting but it became more nicely blended.

**CABINET OF CURIOSITIES (REVISITED) (dusty wood cabinets, ancient Greek rosemary-lavender incense, fossilized amber, Lucky Hand root, carved sandalwood idols, rare spices, rhodiola root, papyrus poems written in jasmine ink, rare ambergris, and ancient vellum.)** My impression last time was that it was between Dustsceawung and Bibliotheca while being worse than both, let’s see. It still opens with a fresh astringent (lavender water and ink?) smell, but much less unpleasant and sterile and cleaning product-like than last time - I get a fair bit of woods now. The dusty hay is much less all-consuming and sneezy than Dustsceawung, instead a fair bit of the dustiness comes from the sandalwood. Not much spices, maybe a bit of black pepper. Definitely much more than the 3/10 I gave it last time, because this powerfully astringent smell has gone away - but I’m not passionate about what it is now. It’s a fairly unisex wood scent with a bit of green dustiness and very watery, light florals - like being in an apothecary where they’re storing dried jasmine tea and dried rosemary and etc inside of jars. The papery note is quite successful, it does read like cracked papyrus rather than the usual vanillic smell. More unisex than Bibliotheca, which reads explicitly masc to me, and while Bibliotheca goes more for an “older gentleman’s club” cologney vibe, this is a bit more atmospheric and strange - but less so than Dustsceawung because there is enough mainstream notes (a very faint floral and sandalwood) that brings it back to reality. I kind of like the vibes, but it’s very very faint and I can’t see myself going for it. **6/10**

**SANTAL ALCHEMY (AUGUST 2025) (Santal, clean white ginger flowers, tuberose, hibiscus tea, a summer-light kiss of coconut cream.)** In the vial: a lot of sandalwood with some hibiscus, but the hibiscus is mellow, not tart as it usually is in teas. On the skin: definitely sandalwood with a woody coconut that goes pretty well with it. It’s a bit like massoia wood, that almost milky powdery sort of wood. The hibiscus, again, doesn’t take over and make this too tart, I think it’s a good supporting note. The tuberose combines well with the coconut but almost pushes this into tropical, but doesn’t quite cross the line into that. I really like this - it’s almost sunscreen without screaming it, manages to make me think of the beach without having any aquatic notes, just conjures up the idea of the sand... I’ve only smelled massoia once (in Pineward’s discontinued Alfiryn) but this reminds me very much of that: lactonic woods, coconut and sandalwood, just the lightest touch of floral to lighten it up. Not my usual style and, like many alchemies, very faint, but still an easy wear, elegant yet slightly playful with the tuberose. **9/10**

**AFFAIRE DE COEUR (creamy white musk, Madagascar vanilla, white sandalwood, tonka, white amber, and sugarcane.)** In the vial: oh no… partly it’s a nice creamy sandalwood but partly… I’d recognize that anywhere… Alkemia’s baby wipes white musk… On the skin: not the *worst* Alkemia Baby Wipe White Musk I’ve ever smelled because the vanilla and white amber are really trying their hardest to temper it and bring a sort of buttery sweetness to it. I will be fair to it: I guess the outcome isn’t \*un\*pleasant if this scent profile is for you: it smells clean and sweet, an unusual combination if you tend to find sweet scents too cloying or gourmand. The very gentle woodiness of the sandalwood goes well with the white musk as does the creamy tonka. The vanillic elements definitely are more on the tonka side, richer and nuttier, than a cupcake or body lotion type of vanilla. It’s very gentle and borderline lactonic - the white musk, which due to my mental associations is not unlike a laundry spray, makes this “brighter” than many of their white ambers which are heavier and more buttery, if that’s something you’ve been looking for. **6/10** because I’m so against this specific white musk note but this is where it’s worked the most, I wouldn’t HATE smelling like this. If that’s more your speed I think this is nice.

**ENCHANTEE (REVISITED) (fresh green tea, fallen cherry blossoms, red cherry musk, bamboo, sandalwood, and shaded moss.)** I think when I tried this one fresh I found the notes too discordant? In the vial: definitely sandalwood and a bitter herbal green tea, it seems calmer now. On the skin: strange. There is almost a metallic undercurrent to this? Maybe it’s their moss, sometimes it’s read mineralistic to me, but it could be the bitter aspects of the tea. The cherry is light, not overpowering, but I can detect it and it’s unpleasant. Very cough syrup. There is a light floral note, but it’s not overly sharp or screechy as I tend to find floral perfumes, it’s quite mellow and watery. This is just a strange one. It doesn’t lean a lot into the sandalwood, doesn’t lean a lot into the juiciness or tartness of the cherry, doesn’t lean too much into green notes, doesn’t lean too much into the floral notes… It’s fine? It’s a very. Nonthreatening clean floral smell. I guess. I think I could probably just buy a pink or green eau de toilette to smell like this for a couple of bucks. I guess the floral has to be a cherry blossom so if you’re in a hunt for those you might as well try this one, but for me, I dunno. Still a **4/10** I guess.

**MADAM PEARL (White tea leaves, bone china, parchment letter, vanillas, aphrodisiac white pepper.)** In the vial: Mostly a very soft green tea, not too sweet or too herbal. On the skin: a somewhat oily citrus (as in bergamot oil) that I do believe they use for their bone china accord. It involves Earl Grey somehow, but the tea is much more on the green side (fresh) than a drier, bitter black tea, so the effect is different. It’s a bit airy - not via aldehydes and not via watery florals, the notes are just all very delicate. I would worry about the vanilla overpowering everything else but it just provides a very gentle base that melts nicely into the skin, not cloying or gourmand at all. The greenness is not in the way of fresh juicy greens, it’s almost spicy, like sniffing a bag of sencha. The white pepper is veryyy subtle but it contributes nicely, it doesn’t have the “kick” that a lot of pink pepper fragrances do, it provides more of a dusty spiciness. Which is interesting, because I associate that pink pepper to citrusy fragrances, and this unmistakably has citrus, but it reads completely different - more the oil from lemon skin than the juice. It’s a bit… I wouldn’t say powdery in an actual talc powder way, more like… in the way bath bombs smell powdery. That baking soda sort of powder. Not in a bad way! I actually like it a lot. It provides a grounding base, otherwise this would smell like a generic green tea EdT. Clean without smelling like cleaning product or baby wipes or flowers- it does lean the sliiiightest bit soapy (I think the aforementioned baking soda vibes) but I don’t mind. I would definitely reach for this if I wanted to smell elegant but distinctive, day or night. I am not obsessed enough for a 10/10 but I will very happily use this up, **9/10**.

**EXPERIMENT 10 AKA SENSE AND SENSIBILI-TEA (Fresh green tea, bergamot, garden mint, hyacinths, green patchouli, and white sandalwood)** In the vial: quite sweet bergamot and spearmint. On the skin: definitely not heavy on the patchouli, or at least not the rich, earthy metallic kind. The green tea is less dusty and spicy than in Madam Pearl, more dominated by a faint, sweet mint and bergamot. Definitely a less airy fragrance due to the woody base of the sandalwood This one is a bit odd, it’s kind of a generic pleasant watery floral despite the somewhat distinctive notes. Madam Pearl does the green tea and bergamot better, I’d expect a bit more garden mint to set this apart (and because I like garden mint a lot) but it’s a very soft backdrop, the patchouli and sandalwood are just… providing a generic, uninspired base to this. I think the bergamot is bringing out a sort of oiliness in the patchouli which makes this fragrance less fresh and thicker than Madam Pearl. I think the hyacinth may also be a bit potent and making this headier. I think while Madam Pearl seems very carefully balanced, this feels more… well… an experiment. These notes don’t quite come well together, it comes across a bit confused - I think from their usual lineup, The Secret Garden does something very similar to this, same bergamot and garden mint and green patchouli. This is perhaps a touch more fresh but the green tea doesn’t shine much beyond that. This is gonna fall in the box of Alkemia 5ml vials I pack for conference trips so I can use them up because they’re nonthreatening but boring (I’ve already used 3 alchemies up this way). It’s whatever, definition of a **6/10**.

**LOST HIGHWAYS (Saw Palmetto Palm leaves, Southern cypress, New mown hay, Lemon basil, Wild bergamot tea, Linden blossom, Acadian pine, Night flowering desert flowers, Spicebush and Incense cedar.)** In the vial: less fresh than I expected, a bit more of a dew-damp leaves, wood and citrus. On the skin: interesting. It's quite well blended. I can mainly get the oily bergamot and spicy greens. There is a tinge of fresh fir and smoky incense but it's not too much. The overall effect is a bit of an oil you'd think of more as a room fragrance than a personal one. The citrus isn't overpowering or anything , this is definitely the smell of an aromatic plant you'd decorate your house with, and you rustling its leaves with your hands and smelling it. The florals are there, a bit of synthetic jasmine, but they aren't enough to take this out of the unisex range. It's a bit too herbal, very aromatic. Quite unique in Alkemia’s range, I enjoy it. There is something about this that does reminds me of playing as a kid in the playground in Spain due to the many palm trees. Can't give it a 10/10 because it doesn't make me think ""I NEED to own this” and it's a tad too aromatic, but it's a surprise **9/10**, well blended, fresh without being astringent, unisex but floral, a very easy no brain summer pick with personality. 

**EXPERIMENT 13 AKA OUTSTANDING IN THEIR FIELD (A grassy field in midsummer, flowing meadow streams, light cotton, moroccan tea, blue juniper)** In the vial: the juniper is definitely heavy on the berry, because I'm mostly getting ripe blueberry from this. On the skin it changes, a lot of the cottoon comes out, very much a white/blue laundry softener type of cotton. I'm not getting a LOT of grass but there is some of that herby, almost parsley green in the background. What is louder IS the meadows part, is that lightly fresh, almost mineralistic note that shows up in Moss Maiden or Frondescence. It usually leans Irish Spring but I think here it doesn't because the accompanying green notes are on the grassier end. You still definitely get a lot of blueberry but there is some spicy greenness from the aromatic juniper. Not really mint or green tea unfortunately. It's a fun scent, reminds me of Baccante but less realistic and with a cotton base that makes this a bit clean. **8/10**

**LUCKY ALCHEMY (MARCH 2025) (Unfurling ferns, freshly flowing cool waters, ethereal greens, and herbs traditionally associated with luck and protection.)** In the vial: OHHH MY GOD. As you know I LOVE Alkemia's greens and this is the best I've smelled. The perfect balance between their fresher aquatic greens and their more salad-y summer greens, intensely like freshly squished green leaves. There is something almost creamy and vanillic in the background tying it all together, but it doesn't stand out on it's own. On the skin this has the Alchemy curse of being very faint, but I don't care. This is up there with The First Dandelion and Vert Sur le Vert. Such intense clovergrass smell it's almost thick, fresher than VSLV, like TFD without the dirt. Easy **10/10**, plays right into my tastes.

**MAGNOLIA AU VERT (Fresh white magnolia blossoms and bright spring grass with lily of the valley, green mandarin and a sensual caress of musky vanilla.)** In the vial: something dusty and woody about this vanilla, reminds me a bit of Dryad - vanilla grass? On the skin: a while lot of lily and I guess magnolia, a bit sweatier (but not powerfully indolic) than most white florals, almost damp. The grass is not bright and green, it almost reads like dried hay. Then a bit of a creamy vanilla and a touch of white-musk-baby-wipes. The florals are again more damp than fresh, but not purely indolic like capital J Jasmine. I like it, but I like Lucky Alchemy’s manifestation of creamy greens more, this is kind of basic. I will be comparing it to Dryad. **7/10**

**FAERY ALCHEMY (MAY 2025) (The ionized air of a brightly bubbling woodland spring, veils of soft moss, heliotrope, mimosa, sweet woodruff, and vanilla grass.)** In the vial: omg this smells like soap. Not in a bad way, not in a ""they accidentally made soap with notes that read soapy to me"" way, in a ""this very purposefully smells like soap bubbles"" way. Veryyy fizzy and aldehydic, borderline citrusy. On the skin: definitely mostly fizzy aldehydes, missing the booze note that usually accompanies champagne which is how this usually shows up. There is the slightest cold green edge to this, moss, but it's mostly just Bubbles. Very light, watery florals. The vanilla grass aspect is much quieter than in Magnolia au Vert or Dryad. Very whimsical and fantasyesque. **8/10**, not exactly to my tastes but I admire its uniqueness and it feels like a fun summer freshie.

**\~Bonus review\~**

**GHOST STORY ALCHEMY (OCTOBER 2025) (leather-bound storybook, ginger-spiced cookies, pumpkin, looming shadows, forested woods, ritual incenses, a dropped pouch of tobacco, angelica root, juniper, and lavender.)** In the vial: ginger cookies, very similar to Slice of Heaven Alchemy. On the skin it's more complex, the book smell immediately comes out and I think it's one of Alkemia’s best book smells (did they crack the code to this recently?) - I also get a very workshop-y wood (cedar?) and some aromatics, juniper and lavender. This is unusual for Alkemia, it reads more like one of Solstice’s atmospheric/incenses (I Will get around to reviewing them soon!), it does make me think of being in an old manor or castle. Much much less sweet and spicy than Slice of Heaven, like one of the components of the whole story rather than the star of the show.  A quiet, medidative wooden base with enough spices and aromatics to keep my interest and a very sophisticated book smell. I don't get much tobacco bust I think It contributes to the dusty, spicy woods. A surprise **10/10**, with the usual Alchemy caveat of the lack of strength.

Now, the first time it happened, i was getting calls, but decided to stay longer to help her with her seminars, i ended up suggesting a different topic and explained everything, she started yelling at me ""YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT"" and told me to just leave, i said good luck, left my notebooks with her and left.

I later found out she actually presented my topic, and she had done well.

Next two days she did not talk to me at all, mind you i'm skipping work to see her, risking my job.

Around some time before Halloween i started seeing a pattern where she would text/call other friends to meet up, but ignore my calls, and would say ""i didn't see your text/call"" when confronted.

Then this past weekend, I took a day off at work, went to see her, she sat down with her friends, i sat down but felt uncomfortable because they're all females, so i stood up, went to grab a coffee, and 5 minutes later when i come back, i see her walking and calling and decided to surprise her.

So i walk up to her (btw, the only words we exchanged that day were hi and hello) and she hangs up her call, turns around to see me, and loudly says ""I'm meeting R, bye"" R being her guy friend.

I didn't text the whole day, then a day after that, much like any other time i get a text saying ""WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM? YOU'RE SO CHILDISH"" as a conversation starter.

I simply said don't ever talk to me again, because i was so tired of explaining.

If i'm the asshole i will go apologize right now, but i feel like even if she doesn't want me around, least she can do is tell me, instead of complaining about me being cold and dry.",1,1762635441.0,AITAH,4,0.6,False

1os06a6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1os06a6,Grinder report: Eureka Mignon Zero,"I've had my set-up for ten days now. Managed to organize Coffee Corner a little, but still some work to do. When I posted last, a lot of you asked about the grinder, so I thought I'd report back now I've had a chance to pull some shots.

The only thing that isn't stock on the GCP is the basket - using a 17-19g Pullman basket. I've been brewing mostly light roasts including some experimental lots. I used a temp surfing protocol I learned from Lance Hedrick: flush until light turns off, wait for light to turn back on, wait 10s, switch to steam mode 5s, then brew. I don't RDT, I grind into the dosing cup, tip into basket and shake, WDT 5 stirs, and tamp. My recipe is 18g in, 38-42g out depending on coffee, around 26-28s. I'm using a 50/50 mix of TWW classic profile and Brita filtered tap water (moderate hardness).

For espresso, the grinder has been amazing! It is quiet and has very low retention. I've stopped bothering to weigh my grounds once I've dialled in the coffee. And by quiet I mean I sometimes don't realize it's still on.

The shots have been juicy and sweet, good clarity and low astringency. For really light roasts, I'm about 3-4 notches from the zero point. For medium-light more like 10-12 notches. A bit coarser than that for African beans and decaf. No difficulty getting tasty shots, even with some funky anaerobics. 10/10 thrilled 😁 

One drawback is the dial - it rotates fully around several times so the numbers really are useless. To switch to filter grind sizes you have to go a couple of times around, so the only reliably way to record a dial-in is number of notches from the zero point.

I brewed a pour over and wasn't impressed: good clarity, but very flat and lacking sweetness. This makes sense as the burrs are intended for espresso (the ""Brew"" version of the grinder is optimized for filter). So, it's not a switch hitter, but for espresso it's great unless perhaps you like to switch between different roast profiles a lot, with dark roasts probably being significantly coarser on the dial.

I haven't used a DF54/64, so I can't say directly how it compares. I have tasted a lot of espresso made with commercial grinders though, including some with SSP burrs, and I have to say the EMZ holds up.",23,1762635071.0,gaggiaclassic,7,1.0,False

Is there anything else we can try? 

Unexplained infertility. I had 3 chemicals and 2 implantation failures with my five transfers. I started IVF at age 29. 

I had an extensive lab panel done and followed up with specialists accordingly, so far, just monitoring. We did karyotype, checked for all the cystic fibrosis/fragile X/etc tests. We did the lupus panel test. We checked bleeding disorders, thyroid, etc. I have repeated multiple lab values as necessary. 

I had the EMMA/ALICE, ERA and Receptiva (BCL6) biopsy all done. I have already tried 3 months of Lupron suppression after a positive from BCL6 protein, and this was before my fourth transfer (a chemical pregnancy). I did multiple rounds of 2 weeks of antibiotics. We followed the ERA for the fifth transfer (that failed to implant). My doctor does not recommend laparoscopy and believes Lupron suppression is a better option. No other signs of major endometriosis. 

I have done 4 medicated protocols and 1 modified natural. I prefer medicated because of scheduling and no trigger. It gives me less stress 

I have tried Claritin, Pepcid, steroids, neupogin, baby aspirin, acupuncture. I’m taking a ton of supplements (CoQ10, myoinositol, Vitamin D, Omega, melatonin, prenatal, vitamin B12). We both gave up alcohol. I don’t drink coffee

During my last two egg retrievals, we got 1 PGT-A tested euploid embryo each time (even though we had 24 eggs and 16 eggs retrieved respectively). We did ICSI and the antagonist protocol and tried the microlupron flare. The microlupron flare made my estrogen levels really high so we will not be doing that again. 

Tests are normal for my husband. 

My mom had children with no issues. No known genetic issues. 

What am I missing??  

What can we do to make the next transfer work? 

Thank you!

However, I wanted to post here about one thing that was overlooked: If you are going to the game tonight, YOU HAVE AGENCY. This is not like watching from home or at a bar. You aren't play, coaching, or officiating (right?), but you and your actions can impact the outcome of this game. 

Players and coaches have said that TQL is a great atmosphere, but it can get anxious, and that DOES impact the players. If you're feeling anxious because it's level in the 78' or hopeless because FCC are down and it feels like last time, remember that your energy is contagious. It impacts the atmosphere and it can impact the outcome of the match.

What do you do instead? Focus on the positives you want: Remember the feelings of the great moments. Remember the awed applause after Denkey's bicycle. Remember the ""Oh my God""s watching Luca score from the parking lot (twice). Remember how you felt after that banger Evander scored (pick one). Remember watching Djiby's header loop over the Columbus keeper and find the side netting at Nippert. Remember Mitch Hildebrant pushing aside yet another MLS-player's penalty for a semi-final berth. Remember beating Miami 6-1 or 3-0. Even remember the explosion after Lucho's late goal against Philly last year. 

Now realize that YOU can help this team find the energy or the focus for that kind of singular moment of magic that's been the difference in so many games over the last 4 years. 

Show your appreciation for the great shielding in the corner for a goal kick by Powell or Hagglund. Clap loudly for Ender or Luca harassing a winger or defender into giving up a throw in. Yell a ""Hell Yeah!"" for an improbably fast Miles Robinson recovery. Cheer for a great build up even if Denkey's or Brenner's shot sails just wide. Don't focus on the negatives, embrace the promise of good plays. Let them FEEL the momentum these moments can build for them if we embrace it and lift them up. Do it with your hands or your voice, but be counted tonight.

It's Saturday. I'm gonna go get a coffee. I'll see you all at 6.

during a vacation in a european city with my family i coincidentally met a girl, on a family vacation too, asked her instagram and we had a coffee together the next day. She is from an asian country and i'm european. We are both mid-20s, i'm in the last year of uni, she just finished. She now lives in another european country and is looking for a job. The ""date"" went really good, it lasted 4 hours going on multiple places and it ended because i had to leave (we did not kiss), we said we would meet again. We texted for the days after and i asked her after 3 days if we could find a way to meet. She said she really enjoyed spending time with me and texting with me, but she must find a job or her visa will get revoked (i think she has like 6 months left), so she doesn't feel to make plans right now. I said that i understand her position and offered to go to her so she has less time and financial constraints, she also said she need to think about it because she had bad experiences with long-distance stuff (didn't get into details, it was just one phrase).

After that, i texted her after like 4 days asking how it was going, we texted for a bit then again i texted her responding to instagram story 3/4 days later. She didn't bring up the meeting thing again.

On the texting front, she is really engaging, she ask questions, texts are pretty long and we had engaging conversations for like 2 hours on some stuff i study at university. She does take a long time to respond tho, usually 4/6 to 24 hours.

Should i bring the meeting again? to me i would feel it's too much. Should i wait on her to talk about it again? Does it even make sense to continue text with her if she hasn't shown real intention to meet?

**COLD OPEN**

**INT. JOE’S LIVING ROOM – DAY**

Joe, a kind but utterly clueless middle-aged man, sits in front of a brand-new printer surrounded by tangled cords and unopened manuals. The printer beeps angrily.

**JOE**  
(to himself)  
It’s just paper, ink, and buttons. How hard can it be?

He presses a button. The printer makes a grinding noise, ejects a blank page, and starts smoking faintly.

**JOE**  
Okay… progress?

Cut to opening theme.

**ACT ONE**

**INT. JOE’S LIVING ROOM – LATER**

Joe calls **Tech Support**. After a robotic menu nightmare, he finally reaches **RAVI**, a calm but weary technician from a call center.

**RAVI**  
Thank you for calling HP Support. My name is Ravi, how may I assist you today?

**JOE**  
Hi Ravi. My printer… it’s alive. I think it’s trying to fax my toaster.

Ravi sighs quietly.

**RAVI**  
Sir, may I have the model number?

**JOE**  
Sure thing. Uh… it’s “X” … and then a smudge of coffee… and then maybe a “Q”?

**RAVI**  
Sir, could you read the label on the back?

**JOE**  
I’d love to, but the printer’s on fire a little bit.

**RAVI**  
(on autopilot)  
Please unplug the device, sir.

Joe unplugs *his lamp*.

**JOE**  
Done!

The printer *beeps louder.*

**ACT TWO**

**INT. JOE’S APARTMENT – CONTINUOUS**

Ravi walks Joe through resetting the printer. Each step only makes things worse. The printer begins printing gibberish symbols and emojis.

**RAVI**  
Sir, that’s not supposed to happen.

**JOE**  
Is it printing hieroglyphics? Should I call a museum?

**RAVI**  
No, sir, please do not call a museum.

As Joe follows directions, the printer somehow connects to his *microwave*, which now says “READY TO PRINT.”

**JOE**  
Oh great, now my lasagna’s getting updates.

**ACT THREE**

**INT. JOE’S LIVING ROOM – EVENING**

After two hours, Ravi and Joe have bonded through shared suffering.

**RAVI**  
You remind me of my uncle. He once tried to print a PDF by holding it up to the scanner.

**JOE**  
Your uncle sounds like a genius.

Finally, Ravi suggests reinstalling the driver.

**JOE**  
Reinstall it? Ravi, I think the driver’s already left the vehicle.

Joe accidentally presses the “self-cleaning” mode. Ink sprays everywhere.

**RAVI**  
Sir, please tell me you didn’t—

**JOE**  
Oh, I did.

**TAG SCENE**

**INT. JOE’S LIVING ROOM – NIGHT**

Joe, covered in ink, finally manages to print one page. He holds it up triumphantly.

**JOE**  
It worked! Ravi, it worked!

**RAVI**  
That’s wonderful, sir! What does it say?

**JOE**  
(reads)  
“Printer Error: Contact Support.”

Joe stares at it. The printer powers down dramatically.

The dry down surprised me though; it turns a bit fruity and minty on my skin, which I wasn’t expecting. Not bad, just different! I’ll probably save this one for the Christmas season. 6/10

🍓 Raspberry Holiday Pie Bar
This one opens with delicious notes of toasted almonds and raspberry filling — spot on! I don’t really pick up the sugar cookie note on my skin, but the raspberry adds plenty of sweetness on its own. I’ll definitely be reaching for this during summer when I’m craving something bright and sugary. 6.5/10

🎄 Cinnamon Sugar Pretzel Cookie
Heavy on the cinnamon — in the best way! It instantly gives off cozy holiday vibes and honestly made me even more excited for Christmas. I just wish I got a bit more of the pretzel and sugared vanilla notes, but overall, it’s a delicious, comforting scent. 8/10

🍦 Cereal Milk Soft Serve
This one really surprised me! I didn’t expect to love it as much as I do. Based on the name, I thought I might smell like a bowl of cereal milk (lol), but on my skin it’s a creamy vanilla soft serve with a hint of cornflakes — super gourmand and addictive. 9/10

🎂 Milk Bar Birthday Cake
She’s THAT girl — and will always be that girl! My absolute favorite. It’s sweet, fluffy, and just so yummy. I already have two backups and will definitely grab more. 20/10

🥛 Milk
This one’s a cozy must-have. It’s simple, soft, and comforting — perfect as a bedtime scent. Definitely backup-worthy.

☕️  Vanilla Café
Another backup for me, no question! It’s such a perfect cold-weather scent — warm, creamy, and cozy with that touch of coffee sweetness. Please, BBW, bring this one back next year!",30,1762634264.0,bathandbodyworks,0,1.0,False

we’re experimenting with something wild in bangalore:

Timing: 10AM to 6PM
Work From Club - free entry, chill music, good food, DJ spinning deep house all day (not loud), people working, creating, vibing.

no tickets, no pressure. just bring your laptop and vibe.

you can order anything you want - coffee, drinks, brunch, whatever. and do your deep work.
stay as long as you want. meet founders, devs, designers, freelancers, creators - everyone’s just working on something.

we’re not announcing the club name here publicly (to keep it intimate), but if you’re interested, DM me and I’ll share the invite + club details.

this could become a weekly thing if it clicks.

if this sounds like your vibe, drop a comment or DM.
let’s see if bangalore’s ready to work from the club. 

NOTE: we might take a small refundable booking charge, fully refunded once you reach the club - just to make sure you actually show up. if people book and don’t turn up, it ends up costing us a lot since we block spots and set things up for the day.",5,1762634223.0,bengaluru_speaks,4,1.0,False

## 3 Pro Tips for Stress-Free Christmas Shopping

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=top%20christmas%20gifts)

1.  **Listen for Hints All Year Long**: The best gift ideas often come from casual conversations months in advance. Keep a note on your phone when someone mentions something they love or need.
2.  **Think About Their Problems**: The best gifts solve a problem. Do they always complain about cold coffee? Get a mug warmer. Do they lose their keys? Get a Tile tracker.
3.  **Don't Underestimate Experiences**: Often, the most cherished gifts aren't things, but memories. A cooking class, a weekend getaway, or tickets to a game can create moments that last a lifetime.

I just ordered a Profitec Go after some long research, to upgrade from my first espresso machine, a cheap Breville Prima Latte III. I found a deal (I think) and got the yellow Go for 845 EUR.

I already ordered some accessories, and am now not sure if I also need to upgrade my grinder. I have a manual one, a Timemore C3. Mostly I had a good experience with it, but also some issues: At times, the spacing of the clicks has proven to be too big. On a particular click, the shot took like \~20s, and when I tuned the dial one click tighter, coffee was barely dripping out of the portafilter.

Now I'm aware there are some plate upgrades I can buy, which provide more clicks, but I'm asking myself if I should rather just buy a better grinder instead. Except of this clicks issue, is the Timemore C3 generally ""good enough"" for the Go?

If not, could you please suggest some good manual grinders? I prefer manual to keep the price down. In the sense that I would rather spend 200 EUR on a manual grinder that grinds great, than on a automatic grinder that grinds bad. I only prepare espresso-based drinks.

I relate to Elliot in so many ways. The big themes and scenes are brilliant, of course , but a lot of the smaller interactions and scenes were so poignant and well done as well. One was the scene when he meets Shayla. When he says, I wish we already knew each other. That’s how I feel all the time, and (ironically) I know I’m not alone there. That feeling of isolation, wanting to connect with someone special but not knowing how to break through the ice. I have been isolating ever since I broke off the one time I got finally got engaged, which was sort of around the same time Covid isolation was recommended. I haven’t had a date in like 8 years since, my world never really resumed post-Covid. I stopped djing, which was the main thing that got me out of the house, and never resumed attending social events the way I was pre-Covid. I feel like, even if I actually finally meet someone, which is near impossible in my current state of withdrawal, I am always so awkward and nervous, and I wish I could skip the whole first few months getting to know someone. 
I just love the way he had the courage to say that to her, that never would have occurred to me before seeing that scene. I love Elliot’s courage in being self aware, and being forthright with it right away, with other people. Just saying, well, here I am just as I am, take it or leave it. But in the real world, there just don’t seem to be many Shayla’s, I feel like most people just decide at face value that ‘leaving it’ is their first instinct when it comes to shy awkward people.

Hey everyone,
I’ve been living in Rome for about 7/8 years now, and even though I’ve met quite a few people over time, most of those connections have slowly faded… and this winter I’m feeling lonelier than ever.

I’d really love to meet some new people here. I enjoy sports, so if you play volleyball or badminton, I’d be super happy to join!

I’m also into video games (though my old laptop can only handle the simpler ones 😅). Recently I’ve started reading again and even joined a gym, trying to make a few changes in my life instead of waiting for the usual “New Year’s resolutions.”

I like being outdoors and a homebody, depending on my mood: chatting over coffee, going for walks, watching a movie, or just discovering new places around the city.

I’m also trying to finish my degree (a bit behind schedule 😅), so if anyone’s looking for a study buddy or some shared motivation, that would be awesome.

I’m only went there to hang out on my own because I like the vibes there, but I noticed this very lovely barista girl who works there one day she gave me a free coffee because she made one by Accident and they give regulars like me some free drinks from time to time when that happens it made me really notice her so I kind of been getting to know her a little more. 

She’s very nice, down to chat when o engage with her, and when things are slowed down work wise we get a decent conversation going.

However it’s also at her work and I understand she needs to be professional and not just spend time chatting with a customer when there’s actual stuff she needs to do. So if she’s busy I’ll maybe say a quick comment or back and forth with her and not bother her while she’s handling other customers. 

I don’t want to come off as a creep by hovering or anything, like I don’t stare at her when she’s not looking. 

The thing is it’s hard to gauge if there’s actual interest with me as a romantic partner or just  even as a friend when she’s on the clock and the only time we really see each other is when she’s on the clock.

The first interpretation is odd, because it seems as if there is most definitely a connection between Jane Slept In The Church, and Jane Doe. Given that one of the characters in Jane Doe is evidently Reze, it would be weird if the “Jane” in this song is in fact Asa. I very much doubt this interpretation to be the correct one, although it does have some references to her.  
  
Interpretation 2:

Int. 2 and 3 have more merit to them. Interpretation 2’s main argument would be by using the logic I talked about in int. 1. If “Jane” is the same character, and we assume Jane to be Reze, then it may follow that this tells the story of Denji talking about a peaceful life with Reze.

Interpretation 3:  
  
Int. 3 is sound for two particular reasons. 1. Denji’s love of penguins, and 2. The fact that Reze herself sings this whilst choking the assassin out. This is the most obvious, occams razor interpretation.   
  
Analysis:   
  
The day of my date with Jane 

Everything is ready 

In the morning, we will go to church together (A place of holiness and divine protection.)

We will drink coffee and eat omelets at a café (Crossroads cafe.)

After we take a walk in the park 

We'll go to the aquarium and see Jane's favorites, the dolphins and penguins (IT’S A PENGUIN. Denji loves penguins.)

After lunch, we'll rest 

So, what did we do in the morning?

We'll talk about it until we forget (I’ve seen this be taken into the context of Reze’s amnesia under the control of Makima, but that’s a bit odd. There was no talking involved whatsoever. Even weirder, talking oftentimes helps solidify memories.)

We won't remember (This implies never being able to remember whatsoever. There is no possibility of it!)

And at night, we will sleep in the church (Denji and Reze, despite not remembering, fall asleep together. In any case, this ending can be connected to my other Analysis of Jane Doe.)

  
I’m stumped on this one. I call upon thy fellow cultists (and copists) to aid thy search for meaning!

The fact that I cannot establish this company using the plantations already in the DEI is irritating to say the least, even though you start with a free company slot you have to conquer some random Provence, deal with the high conquest turmoil and then actually build 5 plantations sucks. So even though you start with everything in place to have a coffee company, you need a few precious years to actually get it started. Then on top of this due to how prestige goods work you need to compete with your own colony for top 3, even though your own company owns like half the coffee supply. 


Another  note is that the company headquarters is never in holland, meaning that my poor capitalists aren’t spending that cold hard cash at home, stunting the growth of my services and Luxury goods sectors.

I was yelled at, pushed aside, and told what I think who I am to react like that

The ransom note was written inside the house. 29 years later, her killer has never been found.","A 2½-page ransom note, opening with *“Listen carefully!”* and ending *“Victory! S.B.T.C.”*, was discovered just before 6:00 a.m. on December 26, 1996. It was handwritten on paper from inside the house, using a family pen, and demanded exactly $118,000. The same amount as John Ramsey’s recent work bonus. Investigators quickly noticed how strange that was: in real ransom cases, amounts are usually round figures, not oddly specific sums known only to a handful of people.

What followed was chaos. Police treated it as a kidnapping instead of a homicide. Neighbors and clergy were invited inside. Coffee was poured. Evidence was moved. Hours passed before anyone searched the entire house. At about 1:00 p.m., John Ramsey and a family friend went to the basement and found JonBenét in a small, windowless “wine cellar.” She was wrapped in a white blanket, duct tape across her mouth, and a nylon cord around her neck tied with the broken handle of Patsy Ramsey’s paintbrush. The autopsy ruled the cause of death as asphyxia by strangulation associated with craniocerebral trauma. A fatal combination of head injury and strangulation, but which came first has never been determined.

In the kitchen, police found a bowl of pineapple and milk; the same fruit was partially digested in JonBenét’s stomach. A Hi-Tec boot print was discovered near her body that didn’t match anyone in the family. A palm print on the basement door remains unidentified. The broken basement window that some believe the intruder used was explained by John Ramsey. He said he broke it himself weeks earlier after locking himself out. The well-known claim about undisturbed snow around the window, often cited as proof no one entered or exited, has been disputed by later investigators.

Partial male DNA was detected on JonBenét’s underwear and leggings. It didn’t match any family member, but the sample was extremely small, partially mixed, and vulnerable to contamination. Handwriting analysis excluded John Ramsey, couldn’t conclusively exclude Patsy, and ultimately remained inconclusive. In 1999, a grand jury reportedly voted to indict the Ramseys for child abuse resulting in death, but the district attorney declined to prosecute, citing insufficient evidence. In 2008, the family was publicly cleared based on touch DNA testing, though later experts questioned the strength of that finding.

What remains is a case that collapses under its own contradictions. The “Ramsey Did It” theory fits the note and the household evidence but lacks any clear forensic link. The “Intruder” theory fits the unidentified DNA and boot print but suffers from the absence of a credible entry point. Both rely on facts blurred by contamination and early investigative mistakes. The first 24 hours doomed the case: the crime scene wasn’t secured, the body was moved, and the evidence chain fractured beyond repair.

Nearly three decades later, Boulder PD claims to be working with outside labs to apply modern DNA and forensic genealogy. The hope is that one of those minutes, aging samples: the cord, the garrote, or the clothing might still hold a trace that technology can unlock. But optimism has often outpaced reality.

**Questions for the thread:** If you could run one modern test on one remaining piece of evidence, what would it be? The garrote? The ligatures? Her clothing? Does the $118,000 demand point to insider knowledge or deliberate misdirection? And if you could change just one thing from that morning: locking down the house, conducting a full search, or controlling the media  what do you think would have changed this case the most?",24,1762633172.0,mystery,40,0.79,False

I stayed at a hostel in Singapore for 4D3N where I mostly toured and walked for almost 20k steps a day. I then stayed at a 3-star hotel in KL, Malaysia for 5D4N where I mostly just chilled at my hotel and light walk lang unlike in sg.

On the other hand, staying in Malaysia is really cheap (booking grab is much cheaper here than in the PH).For some reason, I didn’t really enjoy walking around there kasi parang pinas lang. But I enjoyed yung mga coffee shop nila (I dined 2 times at 103 Chow Kit which I accidentally discovered in google maps —sobrang sarap ng food and coffee highly recommended). I also enjoyed just chilling in the hotel, booking grab food or buying food from Jalan Alor food street which is just below my hotel.

I will also be in my 2nd trimester of pregnancy. Looking for advice on which resort we should visit-- we have narrowed it down to 2 options.

1.     Secrets Playa Blanca Costa Mujeres – non-preferred tropical view King room

2.     Valentin Imperial Maya – Golden Swimout King Room

**What we are looking for:**

·       Lush, tropical feel

·       Beautiful pool(s)

·       Delicious and, most importantly safe, food, mocktails, and cocktails – not expecting to be blown away, but looking for decent options

·       Walkable beach is a bonus - doesn't have to be great for swimming, as we are more pool swimmers

·       Relaxing, but some entertainment options would be nice

Mostly we want to sleep in (first trip away from our 1.5 year old), enjoy the sunshine and tropical feel (coming from Canada), relax by the pool, and enjoy the food and drink options.  We would like it to feel like a luxurious experience, but by no means to we need to be waited on.  

I like the idea of the swimout room at VIM, where we could enjoy coffee/breakfast poolside or have an evening swim outside our room, although SPB feels like it is a notch up in terms of luxury (but swimout/oceanview room isn’t in our budget).  VIM is about $200 CAD cheaper for 4 nights, versus SPB.  Atelier was recommended and originally on our list, but it doesn’t seem to have the tropical feel we prefer.

I got married outside India in a very small ceremony arranged by me and my husband. My parents paid for the food and their own travel. My in-laws barely interacted with my parents before the wedding.

My first experience with my in-laws:

When they first met my parents, my parents politely asked where they preferred to eat because they were in a hurry. My FIL said “anywhere,” so my parents walked into a food-court style place. Then my in-laws said they preferred the opposite restaurant, so my parents paid the bill there too. My FIL even went looking for alcohol on the way out. Still, my parents treated them very respectfully.

Later, when I visited their home for the first time as a DIL, the situation felt uncomfortable. They had been asking me about a gold chain because my MIL’s sister supposedly wanted to gift one. I shared pictures of what I liked, but they bought something on their own—without involving me—and gave it to me the moment I entered. It wasn’t my style and even had defects. I didn’t understand why they didn’t wait for my input if it was meant to be a “gift.”

Living environment:

My MIL has very rigid habits bordering on OCD and everyone lives in fear of doing something “wrong.”

No one is allowed to cook except her.

She will not allow you to serve yourself food.

She controls even basic things like snacks.

The house wasn’t cleaned or swept for two weeks, including bathrooms.

If I tried to clean, she stopped me.

Every time we entered the home, she’d force us to wash our feet—even though I was always wearing shoes. But the floor was so dirty that I felt my feet would get dirtier after washing them.


Basic things like tea or coffee were awkward. If my husband asked for coffee and I asked too, she visibly disliked it.

There was constant tension between my in-laws themselves. My MIL is extremely quarrelsome, and arguments went on all day. She would compare herself to me, and even refused to taste prasad that my mother sent.

Once, when we came home late after meeting friends, she made a huge scene and then argued the entire next day. We would lock ourselves in the room just to stay sane.

During their visit to the UK:

They stayed with us for two months. The same controlling behaviour continued.

She cooked only one meal in the afternoon, and we didn’t mind stretching it for dinner and the next day’s lunch because we didn’t want to increase the work for her.

She took control of our kitchen completely.

She would dress up excessively and make us wait for over an hour even for simple outings.

She started talking behind my back and even questioned my education.

She made comments hinting toward dowry, which shocked me.

She complained that my parents didn’t give gold to my husband when he visited my sick mother, even though my parents had already contributed cash earlier.


She offered me her old clothes, made comments about my body, and tried to “clean her wardrobe” by giving me unused Amazon items instead of buying something thoughtfully. Meanwhile, they expected us to treat them every weekend because that’s their routine back home.

Financial expectations: 

My FIL acts polite but subtly encourages my MIL’s behaviour. They frequently judged how my husband and I share responsibilities and tried to create friction.

Despite everything, they never gave us anything for our wedding or for our home. They have money for their lifestyle and outings, but now my FIL is asking my husband to contribute to home renovations.

This bothered me because:

It’s not an emergency or essential renovation.

We are trying to save for ourselves.

We run our home without domestic help to save money.

I personally contributed a lot to setting up our home.

They created chaos at our place but never offered help or support.

Now suddenly they expect financial contribution without ever showing the same consideration toward us.


My husband feels “you should help parents,” but I feel: helping is fine when it’s needed, reasonable, and mutual—not when they repeatedly disrespect you and place their needs above your marital household.

My question:

Am I wrong for thinking we should save for ourselves first before funding non-essential renovations for parents who:

have the means to do it themselves,

never helped us financially,

caused significant emotional distress,

and never acknowledged or apologized for their behaviour?


Is it unreasonable to expect that my husband prioritizes his own household first?
At this point, I feel like if he wants to help his parents first, then I should also have the option to stop working and become a homemaker—why should I keep contributing equally while our resources are being diverted elsewhere?",3,1762632801.0,IndianInLaw,3,1.0,False
1orz9et,https://www.reddit.com/r/inlaws/comments/1orz9et/my_mils_gifts_are_actually_just_her_clutter/,"My MIL's ""Gifts"" Are Actually Just Her Clutter","Okay, I need to know if I'm being an ungrateful brat or if this is as weird as I think it is.

My mother-in-law, Brenda, is a lovely woman in many ways. She means well, I truly believe that. But she has this... habit. She doesn't give normal gifts. For my birthday this year, she gave me a half-used, very expired bottle of fancy perfume from the back of her cabinet and a decorative plate with a chip in it that she ""just didn't have room for anymore.""

This isn't a one-off. For our anniversary, she regifted a vase we gave *her* five years ago. For Christmas, it was a set of mismatched towels that smelled faintly of mothballs. She always presents it with this grand, generous flourish, like she's bestowing upon us the crown jewels.

My husband just shrugs and says, ""That's just Mom. She hates throwing things away. Just say thank you and donate it later."" And I do! I always smile, say thank you, and then the items go straight to the donation bin (or sometimes the trash, if they're truly unsalvageable).

But it's starting to get to me. It doesn't feel like gift-giving; it feels like she's using our house as a dumping ground for things she feels too guilty to throw out herself. It feels less like generosity and more like... delegated hoarding.

The kicker? Yesterday, she came over for coffee and said, ""I don't see the lovely plate I gave you out! Are you saving it for a special occasion?"" I had to lie and say it was packed away carefully.

I feel insane. Am I wrong to be a little offended? It's not about the money or wanting expensive things, I'd be thrilled with a heartfelt card or a batch of her cookies. It's the principle. It feels thoughtless, and it's creating this weird cycle of clutter and white lies.

Has anyone else's in-law turned gift-giving into a passive-aggressive decluttering service? What did you do?
