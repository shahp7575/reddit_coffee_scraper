( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

For a moment I was actually feeling grateful, like wow, these people really put effort into every cup.

Then one barista walked over to pour the milk, and I noticed something on his nose. At first I thought it was a piercing… but nope. It was a tiny drop, like the start of a runny nose. The second I realized, I got the biggest ick. All I could think was: please, please don’t let that fall into my coffee.

Luckily, it didn’t. But honestly, I haven’t been that tense about something in a while. Now I can’t stop wondering — if it had fallen in, or even just noticing it, should I have said something to the barista? Or would that have been weird?",1,1759327856.0,barista,0,1.0,False
1nv98re,https://www.reddit.com/r/weyler/comments/1nv98re/the_hydes_conflict_ff_episode_3_the_hydes_hope/,The Hyde’s Conflict FF (Episode 3: The Hyde’s Hope),"Hi everyone I am back with Episode 3. This will focus on Season 1 Episode 6 - Wednesday’s birthday and when Wednesday, Tyler and Enid worked as a team. 

Tyler recalls how Thronhill told him about how Wednesday's family had link with his mom in the past. He starts to think he would have been normal if they had not interfered. 

He knows Wednesday doesn't show regret for her actions, surely it's a family thing. The best for him is to maintain distance from Wednesday. Screw whatever Thronhill said.

Tyler goes to another session with Kinbott. He was stuck at the moment when Thronhill revealed how Wednesday's family was behind his mother not becoming a normie, and then dying due to her Hyde condition.

Kinbott: Tyler you okay?

Tyler: Umm, yeah.

Kinbott: You sure?

Tyler nods.




Kinbott: So how did the Rave'N party with Wednesday go?

Tyler recalls whatever happened in the Rave'N that day. He didn't like recalling what he did with Eugene.

Kinbott: Well I do know it's Wednesday's birthday coming up next week. Any surprise you planned for her?!

Tyler gets angry as he recalls that he should stay away from Wednesday especially after what Thronhill told him about what her family did to his mother.

Tyler: (very rude) Are we here to talk about Wednesday or me?! I thought I could talk about what I like to, or are you just an incompetent psychiatrist!



Kinbott: (surprised) I am sorry Tyler.

Tyler: You better not mention the name of Wednesday Addams in front of me! If not the consequences won't be good. (smirking)

Kinbott: (freaking out) Okay fine...

Tyler: So what should we talk about?

Kinbott: You can talk about your mom!

Tyler recalls whatever Thronhill told him about his mom and how she could have lived if the Addams family hadn't interfered.

Tyler: You know what! Screw you! 

Kinbott: I thought you liked talking about your mom!

Tyler: Not anymore!

Just then Tyler calms down.

Tyler: Umm I am sorry. I didn't know what just happened. Actually, I am dealing with a lot now.

Kinbott: It's okay. You are here to talk about it.

Tyler: I am worried. I am afraid I may ruin things.

Kinbott: Like what?

Tyler: I can't tell.

Kinbott: Okay relax. Do what you like. You have a shift afterwards right? Just focus on your shift for now. If you feel like talking about it you can drop me a message.

Tyler nods and leaves as the time is over.

Just then, Xavier comes to him.

Tyler: Xavier? What are you doing here?

Xavier: It is Wednesday's birthday next week. Here I have sketched this for Wednesday's birthday cake.  But not sure what her preferred flavour palate is, she doesn't like light flavours.

Tyler: Dark Chocolate Ganache will be a good choice.

Xavier: Yes, that works! I will get someone to pick it up on the day.

Tyler picks the paper from Xavier and thinks of refusing because of the situation.

Xavier: I still do not know what she sees in you.

Tyler: Yeah you leave that up to Wednesday. She can be with whoever she likes. You are so irrelevant that she doesn't care about you.

Xavier: It's hard to understand her, but Wednesday will surely like the cake I designed for her, you can never come up with the idea.

Tyler: At least I am the architect of the idea. You do know right, that if the hands are sloppy even the idea will be ruined.  You don't want that to happen don't you?!

Xavier looks at Tyler weirdly.

Tyler: What?

Xavier: You are just so strange. But whatever Wednesday is going to be like the surprise party we planned for her.

Tyler: Looks like you don't know but Wednesday doesn't even like surprises!

Xavier: If you think you know Wednesday really well, bring her on a date. Wednesday is just giving you company as she pities you - a barista with no friends and a bland personality.  I challenge you to date her.

Tyler: Challenge accepted.

Xavier annoyed.

The words of Xavier trigger Tyler.  He watches videos of how to make an engraved message coffee and he starts trying it.

As he is doing so, he tells himself

Tyler: (in his mind) Wait what are you doing Tyler? You are supposed to maintain distance from Wednesday and instead, you are focusing on impressing her. Why? Even after you know what her family did?! Because of some silly words Xavier said?!

He bakes the cake for Wednesday's birthday and adds 98% ganache as he knows Wednesday loves dark chocolate. 
He smiles and does so happily.

Enid came to pick up the cake.

Enid: Is the cake ready?

Tyler: Yeah.

Enid smiles and she adds a pink balloon topping to it.

Tyler: Wait what are you doing? Wednesday is allergic to colour.

Enid: She needs a little colour in her life. It's not like she's actually allergic!

Tyler: Uh, you sure?

Enid picks the cake and goes ignoring Tyler.

The next day,
Wednesday is reading a book. 




Tyler looks at the Happy Birthday-engraved coffee he prepared for her.



Tyler: (whispering) I should just leave her alone and mind my own business. Anyways, it's better if we stay distant. 

Tyler thinks and then after hesitating when he recalls Xavier challenging him, he brings the coffee to her.

Tyler: I have been preparing this all week. It's not your usual. 

He asks her if she liked the cake he prepared. And from no reply, he can tell she liked it. If she said something she would roast about it, she didn't. Tyler asked her opinion about birthdays.

Wednesday looks at him.

Wednesday: Birthday yes? Happy no!

Tyler: (in his mind) She still maintains her kookiness.

Tyler: Aren't you excited about a whole day just about you? 

Wednesday: Every day is about me. This just comes with a cake and a bad song.

Tyler: (in his mind) And there you go, the typical Wednesday Addams, self-obsessed and makes it about herself.

Tyler: Then would you be interested in a non-birthday, song-free dinner?

Wednesday tells him she has a deadline emphasis on dead. Tyler asked if it was term paper.

Wednesday: It's about how whitewashing your sins in the past can come and haunt you.

Tyler: (in his mind) Perhaps her darkness is what makes me come closer to her. The more distant I want to be from her, the closer I myself get close to her. 

She passed him a sketch and asked if he knew the place. It looked familiar and he realised that Thronhill had driven him there once and told him that no matter what no one should find what's inside there. However, he also accepted the challenge from Xavier and Tyler hates the idea of losing.

Tyler: Hey, I noticed you have been ghosting me since the Rave N Dance! Did I do anything wrong?

Wednesday doesn't say anything. Meaning a yes.

Tyler: I got my answer.

He went back to doing his work and Wednesday left soon.

Tyler's point of view again conflicts as at times thinks to stay away from Wednesday and then again he thinks to take her to a date cause of the challenge Xavier gave him.

He notices the scarf she left which was a gift from Enid. He picks it up. He spots one of Wednesday's friends -  Bianca. He passes the scarf in a bag to Bianca.

Tyler: Umm could you do me a favour? Wednesday left this. Could you give it back to her? Birthday gift from Enid.

Bianca: Aren't you her boyfriend?

Tyler: (in his mind) I wish, but it's better I am not.

Tyler: (smiling) Definitely not.

Bianca: Sure no problem. I was going to leave anyway.

As she was about to leave she saw Lucas coming to meet her and she smiled and stayed back.

Tyler saw their discussion from a distance and was glad that Lucas finally understood that outcasts aren't bad.

As Bianca left, Lucas came to Tyler.

Lucas: You were right man! Outcasts aren't that bad, they are humans too!

Tyler: Better late than never, you realized!

Lucas: Ty, I was thinking for a while.  I understood now. If you can forgive me...

Tyler: Apology accepted.

Lucas: Cool man. I think we should go on a double date with our outcast girlfriends soon!

Tyler: (in his mind) Why does everyone keep thinking I and Wednesday are together?!

Tyler: I will get back to work.

Lucas: Ty, let's be friends again. I miss us having fun.

Tyler ignores Lucas and leaves. He doesn't want to hurt Lucas either, especially when he finally has a positive perspective on outcasts.

Lucas: Wow that Wednesday Addams must be rubbing off on you well. 

Lucas goes disappointed.

The next day,
Tyler gets a phone call from an unknown number and he picks it up. It turns out to be Wednesday.

Tyler: (in his mind) Why is she calling me? Usually, she is distant from others but not me. Why?

Wednesday: I have reconsidered your offer.

Tyler: Offer?

Wednesday: The non-birthday dinner.

Tyler forgot he was supposed to ignore her as it made him happy Wednesday considered his offer despite not being a fan of such things.

Tyler: That's great! When are you free?

Wednesday tells him to pick her up at Nevermore at 8pm. That made him smile. Finally, someone was willing to meet him. He wanted to ask her what led her to reconsider.

Wednesday cuts the call.

Tyler: Uh Wednesday?

Donovan: What did I say, Ty? Come on bud, steer clear of Wednesday Addams.

Tyler: (in his mind) Of course, Dad didn't like me being happy...

Donovan: She's the type who is going to get you hurt. Believe me, I know that type.

Tyler: Is this about mom?

His father denied and was about to leave. He always wondered if his father loved his mother regardless that she was a Hyde.

Tyler: Did you even love her?

Donovan: More than you would ever imagine.

He left as he said that.

Tyler gets thinking. Maybe he should consider his feelings for Wednesday. If someone like his father can accept a Hyde, maybe Wednesday will do the same. She will accept him regardless. He knows about the family history and conflict but it wasn't Wednesday's fault! 

Tyler: (in his mind) Even after knowing about what her family did, I couldn't stop myself from developing feelings for Wednesday! I tried my best to avoid her, but I couldn't. I am telling myself to be close to Wednesday cause of Xavier's challenge but in actual it's an excuse to be actually close to Wednesday. There is just something about her that brought me closer to her, like a magnet. 

Tyler gets out of the flashback as he gets interrupted by the arrival of Fairburn with a lady.

Fairburn: As promised, Tyler you are getting your outside time, unchained and no shock collar. My assistant Judi will help you out.

Tyler looks at Judi as Fairburn leaves. Judi brings Tyler outside.

Judi: Hi Tyler. Hope you will have a good time. Do not make trouble. (laughs)

Tyler: You can control birds. I can sense it. An avian...right?

Judi: (laughing)I don't have a parrot. I didn't know Hydes can be silly too!

Judi goes as Tyler looks at the gate of Willow Hill though under supervision as he sits down to enjoy some alone time outside. He recalls further.

Tyler is waiting for Wednesday in his car. 

Tyler: (in his mind) I need to tell Wednesday my truth. That I am a Hyde. The very monster she is looking for. But today it is her birthday. I will tell her some other time, but it has to be soon! But how will I tell her that?!

Wednesday comes wearing the black hoodie.

Wednesday: Let's go!

Tyler: Umm Hi. Nice to meet you?

Just then he hears the back door of his car opening. It turns out to be Enid, Wednesday's roommate who just sat at the back.

Enid: Wait he's our Uber driver?

Tyler: Uber driver? I thought it was a date!

Enid: I thought this was a girls' night out.

Wednesday: Change of plans. 

Tyler looked at Wednesday and Enid as his date plans were ruined and what distracts him more is the matching hoodies in different colours they both wore.



Tyler: What's with the weird matching hoodie scarf thing?

Wednesday: Don't ask. Just drive.

Tyler drove and he was a bit disappointed that Wednesday brought accompany. But that's how she is - unpredictable.

The trio got down of the car and Wednesday walked to the gate she showed. This surprised Tyler as he recalled how Thronhill told him to ensure no one finds out about this place.

Wednesday: I neither want to go on a dinner date nor a surprise party. This makes me happy. 

Tyler: You could have told us instead of tricking!

Enid: Ditto!

Wednesday: If you want to leave, you can. I am going!

Wednesday walks in.
Tyler couldn't leave her alone in there, nor could Enid. He knew how stubborn Wednesday was. He saw the gates were locked. Wednesday couldn't. He also acted like he couldn't open the gates. He was relieved but then Enid opened them.

Enid: It's a werewolf thing.

This got Tyler concerned that Wednesday and Enid may find out things. He accompanied them and played along.



Wednesday: I and Enid will go upstairs and Tyler you will supervise at the basement.

Tyler nods.

Tyler goes to the basement. He walks around pretending to have a look. 

He goes to a room as if it was a lab and gets shocked at the sight of what he came across.

He saw various body parts of human beings stored in jars. He then saw the head of a guy. It was one of his victims. He gets stunned as if it were a nightmare punishing him for his killings, but it was true.

He gradually understood they were from all his victims. Tyler could not take it and he started puking. He didn't expect Thronhill to be such a dangerous lady. What was she intending to do?

He gets a message from Thronhill.

Thronhill: Wednesday and her roommate Enid are not in their dorm room. Do you know where they are? 

Tyler obliged to say the truth to her replied: They found out your house. They are looking around for evidence. You have quite the setup huh.

Thronhill: Mind your business. And that lil brat Wednesday acting over smart just like her mother. Attack one of them, whoever is part of this. This will be enough for them. Wednesday can't see her friends suffer.

Tyler's phone dropped as he saw that message. He could not harm Wednesday, does he have to attack her? He saw the message again. Thronhill meant one of them. That means he needs to attack Enid?!

Then Thronhill messages Tyler again.

Thronhill: Don't kill. Just attack her friend.

He hears the echoes of Enid's voice.

Enid: (freaking out) Wednesday! I am scared!

He felt bad but he had to attack Enid. Tyler hydes out in anger.

Wednesday and Enid sees the shadow of the Hyde freaking them out. The Hyde slashes as he sees Wednesday and Enid. His target was Enid but Wednesday was coming infront. He could not attack Enid that way unless he attacks Wednesday first.



The Hyde in him was determined to attack but Wednesday and Enid managed to escape.

The Hyde was in anger. The message he saw was ""Attack her friend."" Wednesday's friends are  Enid and Tyler. That means...

The Hyde then slashes himself in anger.

And then he immediately turns back to his human form. He at like his chest which has the marks of his slashes. He wore his clothes and breathed heavily.  

Tyler: (in his mind) It was a narrow escape. I managed to follow the command of my master , fight with my Hyde and also kept Wednesday safe. But this won't happen always..

Then he sees Wednesday running back to the place to find him. She found him wounded and rushed to him.

Tyler: (in his mind) Wednesday...you never fail to impress me. You make me admire you even more. You knew a monster was in there too, you still came back for me risking my life... I was mad at you earlier but you always find a way to melt my heart in your own ways.

This made him forget about his wound. He looked at Wednesday admiringly as she was concerned. 



Just then Xavier turns up there. He passed his scarf for Tyler's wound, genuinely concerned.

Tyler: (in his mind) Of course Xavier will come here to spoil the moment. Nice of him to show concern for me though, but get out man! Good for him he wasn't here, if not he would have been that Wednesday's friend I would have attacked on Thronhill's order!

The four of them went to Tyler's house. Wednesday is nursing Tyler's wound by putting small band aids on his wound. Tyler smiled seeing this. He was enjoying the moment of Wednesday touching his chest and caring so much for him.

Xavier sat there annoyed while Enid was panicking.

Enid: Not to make it about myself but I am having a full-blown panic attack now!

Wednesday: We need to go before Weems realize we are gone!

Just then Donovan comes. He looks at Tyler worried and then angrily walks to Wednesday.

Donovan: This must be you!

Tyler: Wait Dad please, I am okay!

Wednesday: There is something I need to show you.

Wednesday takes Donovan to show what she found. Tyler recalls how Thronhill messaged him some time ago that she came here the moment she found out Wednesday and Enid was gone. She managed to ruin the evidence, so too late as Wednesday won't find anything.

As Wednesday took Donovan, Enid and Xavier went back. Tyler got another message from Thronhill.

Thronhill: I saw what you did there. Don't try to act oversmart, or else you will regret it.

Tyler gets concerned reading this message.

He still recalls the body parts he found in Laurel's labs and it disgusted him and he still feels a shiver in his spine. This is why Laurel became his master and turned him into a monster. He did not know how to come out of this.

Without thinking much, he blocked Thronhill's contact so she couldn't contact him. In that way, his master won't give him any more orders. 

Just then the Sheriff comes back,
Tyler: Dad, Wednesday...

Donovan: We can talk about that later. But there is a really bad news.

Tyler: What is it, Dad?

Donovan: The Mayor, your friend Lucas's dad has passed away. He was killed.

Tyler feels bad for Lucas.

The next day, the funeral of the Mayor takes place. It was a rainy day.

Tyler: (in his mind) Funeral. It is not just for grief, but also a mark that implies that a person has just left the world. The fact that I am the reason behind some people having a funeral for their loved ones. 



Tyler looks at Wednesday who is staring and looking at everyone. He understood she was still trying to figure out who killed the mayor. Who is the monster? She could be thinking they are the same person, but they are not. 

He then looks at Lucas who was crying for his father. 

Everyone left one by one. Tyler came to Lucas.

Tyler: I am very sorry for your loss, Lucas. May your father rest in peace. 

Lucas: Thanks Tyler.

Tyler: Look Lucas, if you feel lonely, I am there for you. You can come and talk to me.

Lucas: Appreciate it, man.

Lucas left to talk with the other guests.

As Thronhill was coming to him, Tyler quickly went to Kinbott to have a chat with him. Principal Weems came to Thronhill and she had to go with her and she looked at Tyler annoyed and desperate to talk to him.

Tyler: I am sorry for the way I talked during the last session. I did not know what had happened to me that time.

Kinbott: It's okay Tyler, it happens.

Tyler: Ms Kinbott. I need your help. I need a session earlier! I need it soon! Please!

Kinbott: Okay okay relax. But unfortunately, I am booked tomorrow. How about the day after tomorrow? Does that work for you?

Tyler: Yes that works fine for me. I will come before my evening shift begins.

Kinbott: See you then. Before I leave, Tyler I noticed you looked tense for a while, especially today. Tell me everything during the appointment, but for now, let me give a tip. Do what makes you happy.

Tyler: Appreciate the tip. But what if I screw up?

Kinbott: Don't think about screwing up. Just do what makes you satisfied regardless of the outcome.

Kinbott smiles and leaves and Tyler goes for his shift. 

Tyler drove his car and he felt relieved. After a long time, he didn't feel obligated to obey orders. It was good to ignore Laurel. He should have seen through her earlier and avoided her. 

He took Kinbott's advice and he smiles thinking about Wednesday. From then he decided his topmost priority would be Wednesday. His father sent him a message to stay away from Wednesday and he ignored it.

He was on his way to do what he wanted, instead of being on orders.

End of Episode 3.

I will post Episode 4 on Sunday and it will be based on Season 1 Episode 7. It will be revolve around Weyler’s date in the crypt and the date planned by Tyler was it to distract Wednesday or a genuine one? It will also portray Tyler’s true feelings when he and Wednesday, they shared their first kiss.",2,1759327806.0,weyler,0,1.0,False

So if someone from Tinder suggests coffee on Friday and then disappears, I still go grab that latte or if someone from Sugarbook agrees to meetup for a movie but falls through, I still catch the film. Instead of sitting around annoyed, I get a little adventure out of it. It's my time too right! No point sitting around feeling sorry for myself

This approach has made dating way less stressful. No wasted evenings, no hard feelings if someone cancels. I either meet someone new or enjoy myself solo. And honestly, it’s made me more open to trying things I wouldn’t have done otherwise.

1nv97mw,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nv97mw,Colour difference in original plant and established cuttings,"The plant on the left is the original plant, the plant on the right is 4 separate cuttings I've put together in one pot with a coir pole to hopefully create a bushier looking adansonii. I want to know why there's such a huge difference between the colour of the original plant and the cuttings over 3 months later.

The original plant was very leggy and after taking cuttings there were no leaves left on the original plant. I called it the stick in the mud and repotted it into a random plastic pot as it had no drainage in the one I recieved it in. I wasn't expecting it to survive but it did really well and everything you can see on the left is new growth in just over 3 months. In that time it's been fed twice with a balanced liquid fertilizer and watered whenever it dried out. The whole time it has been sat on this coffee table around 2 meters from a floor to ceiling south facing window (this is north england so not crazy amounts of sun but plenty for most of my plants who live up against the windows on this wall)

The cuttings were propagated in tap water in brown bottles on my south facing windowsill and moved into individual pots with soil after 3.5 weeks. They took to the soil (houseplant mix from my local community garden centre) really well and once they'd all settled I moved them into this bigger round pot with the coir pole. Since then they've been fed twice and watered almost identically to the original plant, I think once I skipped watering them early on as they weren't quite drinking as fast in their larger pot with their newer roots than the original.

Since propagating them the leaves haven't changed colour significantly, maybe they're a little more pale, but the new growth on the original plant has come in super dark green. I thought maybe the leaves that were already on the cutting might be sad or damaged and would eventually fall off once plenty of new growth came in and that that new growth would be as dark green as the original plants new growth is. Instead the new growth on the props is the same paler colour as the rest of the plant and I just want to make sure I'm not missing something obvious caring for them.

I think on their own they both look like happy plants but the comparison is making me suspicious there's something I could be doing better.",1,1759327732.0,plantclinic,0,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

1nv96sw,https://www.reddit.com/r/roommateproblems/comments/1nv96sw/roommates_uses_oven_without_a_dish_and_oven_gets/,Roommates uses oven without a dish and oven gets really dirty. Everything is a discussion.,"I rent out half of my appartement to someone who is fairly clean but careless and stubborn about very specific things. We share a kitchen and bathroom. She also can't handle feedback and starts discussions and acts passive aggressively (not saying hello) afterwards, if she doesn't get her way. 

I recently spent a long time cleaning the new oven (which I barely use). Put aluminum everywhere afterwards to prevent stubborn stains. 

Roommates ask why this is necessary. I told her it is to prevent burnt in stains. This and using an oven dish. 

She has been using the oven a lot. Never a dish. Only baking paper. Afterwards she removes the paper and the aluminum is a greasy mess. And under it, the tray it is full of burnt in stain. Fluid spills to the bottom of the oven. I don't think she ever cleans it - even though we agreed to, with a list with chores.

So today I cleaned it again. I scrubbed all the sides and the bottom. The grills. .I replaced the aluminum which she had removed. My hair was wet from sweat and oven cleaner afterwards. I had to take a shower lol. 
Also had to soak the tray with a dishwasher tablet since it was so burnt. 

I told her again. Look the oven isn't supposed to get this dirty. That's why I use a dish and foil.  You can even put it in the dish washer afterwards. No extra work. 

She starts a whole discussion with me. 
""But I usually do clean it. This isn't from using the oven without a dish. This isn't me. "" 
???
Then she was like:""I don't like to use a dish and I am not gonna clean the oven after every time I use it""
???
...

I got annoyed. ""Of course it is you. I barely use the oven and when I do, I always use a dish. And I don't take out the foil without replacing it. 
This is a NEW oven. It costs a lot of money. 
It doesn't need to be cleaned everytime you use it,  if you treat it with some care""

TJEEZ


A while ago she broke my glass coffee table and tried to reason she didn't have to pay the full amount for replacing the glass (90 dollar)  even though I had told her she couldnt flip the table or else the glass would come off. She ended up paying but it was a whole discussion.

Vacuum cleaner bag full to the brim again, even though I ask her regularly to check the bag once in a while to not ruin the motor

Dried red water ice cream on a very expensive wool blanket, that she ""forgot to rinse off after she spilt it"". It is not coming out anymore.

And she broke other small stuff too. 

Mistakes happen. Idc.
But I am getting fed up the with the careless and  headstrong attitude when it comes to mistreating other people's  belongings. And passive aggressive attitude. Bringing tension in the house.  

It is my appartement and I furnished it. She only brought in a Senseo I treat with the outmost respect.
Why cant this go both ways?

1nv935h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Daemons40K/comments/1nv935h/meaning_of_human_civilization/,meaning of human civilization,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

[**My (21F) with my Boyfriend (24M) he wants me to cut off contact with his brother, after brother defended me in an argument.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4lubms/my_21f_with_my_boyfriend_24m_he_wants_me_to_cut/)

Boyfriend and I have been together for two years. I have known his brother, who I will call ""Ray"" for most of that time. We have always gotten on well enough.

The whole situation started with my 21st birthday party. We had a party at home with 20 or so friends of family, Ray was of course present at the party, along with a few other members of BFs family.

The party was going reasonably well, as it started to get later I started to get a little tipsy, and most of the guests had started to go home. It eventually got down to a drunken little group made up of myself, boyfriend, Ray and a couple of my girlfriends.

We were sitting outside and one of my girlfriends decided to get on the trampoline, she managed to execute a pretty cool flip, and I expressed that I wished I knew how to do one.

My friend talked me into giving it a try. I got up on the tramp, stumbled drunkenly and fell down laughing. Everyone else (except for BF) was laughing also. It didn't seem like much of an event until BF got up, muttered ""fucking pathetic"" in an angry tone and then told me that we needed to speak in private.

I was pretty confused as to what was going on, so I asked him ""why?""- he answered me with ""Just stop being a stupid cow for a second and come to the bedroom""

Both of my friends and Ray looked pretty shocked at this, but I before I followed BF to the bedroom I told them it was fine and BF was probably just messing around. He can have a real temper sometimes, particularly after a few drinks but I didn't think that would be the case in this instance as literally NOTHING upsetting had happened.

Cut to me and BF in the bedroom. He shuts the door and starts really going off. He tells me that I'm a disgusting drunk idiot and that I was showing off like some kind of pathetic wannabe by messing around on the trampoline. That I was an embarrassment to him and that I was to go to bed now and not leave the room until morning so that I would be more of an idiot in front of company.

As this is going on he is getting louder and louder and is slamming things around the room. I went to leave as I was quite upset at this point, but he blocks the door so I sit down on the bed.

Ray is banging on the door and tells BF to open in. BF goes out into the hall and I can hear he and Ray arguing. Next thing I know it Ray comes into the room and says to go with him. I was sobbing like crazy at this point, because I hate confrontation in general, so I just nod and go with him.

Ray makes sure my other friends have left and then we both get into a taxi. I don't know where BF has gone but he is still in the house sow where.

I'm crying a bunch in the car and don't say much, but Ray calls his and BFs mother and gives her a brief rundown of what happened.

We got to Ray's place, he lives with a couple and they were all really nice. The girl roomate leant me some stuff to sleep in and Ray told me to take his bed and he would sleep on the couch. I was kind of all over the place but eventually got some sleep.

Next morning I got up and had coffee with Ray and one of his roommates. Ray asked if BF had behaved that way before and I let him know about BFs temper but explained that he had never blown up over something as insignificant as me mucking around on a trampoline. I asked Ray if he thought maybe I did or said something that might have upset BF and didn't realise due to being tipsy, but Ray said no, and that BFs behaviour was unacceptable.

I felt silly and embarrassed, especially knowing that R and my friends had heard everything BF had said, and I told Ray I had better get home and try to sort things out.

Ray said that he wanted to stay at his place for just a bit longer to calm down, and that he would really rather prefer that I didn't go home straight away as BF could still be angry.

I gave in an hung out there with Ray and his roommates, we all just played video games and got some takeout, and I ended up feeling much better afterward- so I'm glad I stayed.

Early evening a told Ray I should really go home, I didn't have any of my clothes and more importantly I needed my stuff for university the next day. He drove me over, but didn't really want me to go inside. I told him it would really be fine and promised I would call him if anything happened.

He agreed but said he would wait outside for a few minutes just in case.

I got inside and BF wasn't home so I told Ray to go and went about tidying up from the party.

BF eventually rocked up and seemed calm enough. I told him I thought we needed to have a talk and he agreed.

We sat down on the couch and I explained to him that I didn't think the way he spoke to me last night and asked for an explanation.

His response was ""I will discuss that with you after you delete Ray's phone number, you won't be speaking to him again""

I was confused as all hell at this and asked what that had to do with the matter at hand.

He told me that Ray disrespected him by interfering in our relationship, and that we were cutting ties with him. He told me he wouldn't discuss anything else about the night before until I did that.

I told BF I thought that was pretty unnecessary, and that Ray had been trying to help me because BF was acting really threatening, and that I would have probably done the same in Ray's shoes.

Well, BF did not like that. He yelled, called me some names and left the house. After a few hours he sent me a text

""I am sorry for yelling, but you need to respect what I want if you want the same in return. This can't be one sided. Delete Ray's number and we will finish the conversation. Love you""

I replied that I needed a little time to think and said I would be sleeping in the spare room when he got home and to please leave me some for a while.

I went to bed, heard BF come in very late. He opened the door to the spare room and turned the light on, but as I woke up he just walked out of the room and slammed the door.

So this morning I've woken up, BF is at work and I have a text from Rar, it says-

>Hey **** , I hope you're ok. Look what BF did the other night is really not alright and I think you should get out of there for a while. I've talked to. **** and **** and it's totally fine for you to crash here until you figure out what you want to do

So that leaves me where I am now. Don't know what to do about the situation- do as BF asks and cut contact with Ray, or take Ray's offer of some space away from BF to clear my head. My worry is that if I stay at Ray's that will destroy any chance of fixing things with BF. Advice very much appreciated.

tl;dr: Boyfriends brother spoke up and took me away when BF was blowing up about something fairly small. BF wants me to cut ties with his brother, because he thinks him helping me was disrespectful to him and outer relationship.

**Edit**

When I was able to come back and check on this post I was amazed at the enormous amount of comments and messages I recieved. There has been a lot to catch up on and I am reading everything, thank you to everyone has given their advice. It has cemented the decision I've already made about getting out, but quite a bit has happened in the last day so I will be doing an update for anyone who is curious. I will try to get it up in a few hours:

Again, thank you to everyone who has commented or messaged me, I'm truly touched by all the helpful and caring responses I've recieved

# **Final Update - 1 day later**

[**[UPDATE] Me (21F) with my boyfriend (24M) he wants me to cut off contact with his brother because he defended me in an argument.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4m0gq3/update_me_21f_with_my_boyfriend_24m_he_wants_me/) 

Hi everyone.

First of all, as I said in my edit on my original post I want to thank everyone who offered advice and support. I was amazed at the huge response I got, and while I couldn't reply to every comment I did read all of them.

After Ray texted me, I replied to him asking if he had known my BF to behave like this with other girls in the past.

Over the course of many texts it came out that he often yelled at and belittled his previous girlfriend in front of others, and some of his friends and family had suspicions about how far he was taking it.

After the break up, the girlfriend posted some stuff on Facebook about how BF had hit her, said awful things to her and did other things like spying on her and deleting people from her phone behind her back.

Initially when this happened Ray and his parents questioned BF, but he insisted that the physical abuse accusations where not true and that his EX was saying those things to cover up the fact that she had allegedly cheated on him. BF admitted to yelling at her but he told his family that she did the same and just as often.

His family eventually accepted that, but Ray and his parents were always wary of BFs behaviour and R in particular had made a point to keep an eye on things.

BFs ex apparently had also called Ray around 6 months after myself and BF had gotten together and asked him to help me if anything happened. At the time Ray was not quite ready to believe BF would physically abused anyone, but he told her all the same that he would watch out for me or any other girl in the future.

Ray told me that after the way he saw BF behave at my party he became more convinced that BF was likely to get physical and that was why he chose to step in. He also told me that even if it didn't go that far, I should not put up with how BF treated me.

I agreed, what Ray had told me, and all the information and support I recieved here had me pretty convinced that I was not in a good situation. I decided to go and stay with Ray and his roommates for a short time.

I don't have too many other options for accomodation this urgently. My parents live too far away and the few friends I could stay with are other girls with enough on their plate, and I didn't want to risk bringing this drama to their doorsteps. In retrospect I'm glad I chose to go to Ray's, because I feel like what followed could have been even more frightening and dangerous if only myself and another girl had been present.

I didn't have much time to get my stuff together before BF was due to arrive home, so I packed a few bags of essentials and valuables, along with my school things, and R picked me up.

I left a note at the house for BF I was leaving and that I did not plan on returning, other than to retrieve the rest of my things. I didn't tell him where I would be staying and that I would rather he didn't contact me directly, suggesting he communicate through his mother instead.

I got to Ray's and got settled in, while choosing to leave was difficult and I had a few bouts of crying, I also felt immensely relieved.

Ray/BFs parents came around and brought some dinner. They were incredibly nice about everything and told me I had to do what was best for me. We always got along well but I never expected them to be so kind and supportive given the situation.

Half way through dinner, my phone rang. It was BF. I did not want to answer it and everyone else agreed that was probably a good idea. After my phone rang out, Ray/BFs Mum's phone began to ring. Predictably enough it was BF calling. His dad answered the phone, the phone was not on speaker but BF was loud enough that you could hear him yelling down the phone.

I couldn't tell exactly what was said, but his dad was telling him to calm down, and not to do something. BF hung up on him, and Ray/BF's dad told us BF was coming to Ray's place, and saying this was all Ray's fault.

Ray started to get a bunch of text messages from BF making threats and telling Ray that he knew I was there and ha was coming to get me. Ray replied to him saying that if BF came here and caused trouble he would be calling the police, but BF ignored him.

BF showed up at Ray's probably 15 minutes later. He drove up the lawn and almost hit the letterbox, and got out of his car and started yelling. Ray and his dad went out while I stayed in the front room with his Mum. BF yelled for a while and was kicking at random parts of the garden.

BF started to yell towards the house that he knew I was there and to come out. I wasn't planning on coming out at all and Ray told him to leave.

BF ended up running around the side of the house to the back patio entry, the screen door was locked but the solid back door wasn't, and he started hitting the fly wire trying to break it. He kept yelling into the house that he knew I was there and that if I didn't come out, he would destroy all my stuff and log on to my school accounts and cause problems on there.

Ray and his dad caught up to BF and started pulling him away from the door, BF started throwing punches and his Mum and I both went out to the inside of the back door, because we were worried someone would get hurt.

BF saw me and started trying for the back door again, and saying if I didn't get in the car he would kill himself. His mum said she was going to call the police.

BF/Ray's dad ended up hauling him out to the front yard and told him to leave.

BF did eventually get into the car, he spun his wheels and tore up the grass and drove off.

I felt pretty awful after all that. His mum and dad were both visibly really upset and Ray's rental property had been messed up and I felt responsible, they were still so nice about everything though. They really are wonderful people.

I spoke to the police and they said they would be speaking to BF about what happened and I got some advice about obtaining a VRO and making sure I could find away of retrieving my stuff from the house, so that is all ok for the moment.

The latest news is that BF has been all over Facebook saying that Ray and I had been having an affair and posting all these random cropped blurry porn pictures from the Internet saying it was us, and that he had caught us in the act. None of us are responding to any of it at this point, haven't really decided what to do there.

My plan is to stay with Ray for now. It's still my best option and Ray has said he won't leave me alone at the house in case BF comes back. Either he or his male roomate would be there, we also spoke to a couple of the neighbours that Ray is friendly with and they said they would keep an eye out for his car or call us if they saw anything dodgy.

I'm at a bit of a loss as to what to do next. I'm planning to talk to my uni about getting in to student housing, I'm planning to go out tomorrow to buy some pepper spray also. I'm tossing up about reaching out to BFs ex, but I'm not sure if that will cause more problems for everyone.

So I suppose that's it, for now at least? I'm sorry that this was a bit of a novel- but I know a lot of people wanted an update and considering how nice everyone has been I wouldn't want anyone to worry that I had gone back/stayed with him. Rest assured that is totally out of the question, the more I think about things that happened within our relationship with this new perspective, the more I realise how fucked up some of those things were.

Again a huge thank you to everyone, I'll do my best to keep up with the comments and respond to any PMs

tl;dr left BF, staying at Ray's. Lawn traumatised as a result

>your ex's family sound like great people. I am glad that they are supporting you and you are safe before he got a chance to get physically violent against you, which would have happened eventually if you stayed. Maybe you can file for a restraining order against your ex.

**u/ImStealingTheTowels**
>When an ex's parents even tell you that you did the right thing by leaving them, you most definitely did the right thing.
>
>Your next step should be to get that restraining order sorted ASAP. Your ex is a dangerous man who won't let this go without a fight, so you need the protection of the police if/when he comes back. With regards to Facebook, block him. Don't concern yourself with what he's posting. If people choose to believe him, then you're better off without them in your life too.
>
>Your priority is to stay safe and get him out of your life 100% - and this may unfortunately mean cutting contact with his lovely parents and brother. It's wonderful that they're helping you and being supportive, but unless they completely cut their violent son/sibling out of their lives, you continue to put your safety at risk by remaining in contact with them. If they're as nice as you say they are, they'll understand.
>
>Good luck, OP. I'm relieved to read that you're safe.

1nv8zjb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nv8zjb,Just got my dream vintage sofa and my lounge upgrades are finally complete (before / after) 43m,"I've lived in this apartment for 10 years.  The primary focus of my lounge has always been home cinema and hi-fi, with my system expanding to a 7.1.4 system

Earlier this year I needed a new sofa and realised that I was using a basic IKEA coffee table, my rug was left behind by an old housemate two rentals prior and was too small for the space.

So I decided I could do better and my aim was to curate a certain vibe/aesthetic.  You can see the influences on my room in the art and accessories

I went hard on the rug because of the Asian motifs that are very similar to the cuban collar shirts I would wear on a night out.  The rug fit well with my intended 80s Miami Vice x Tokyo x Cocaine Decor aesthetic

The replacement sofa I bought was tan brown leather, I didn't like it comfort wise so sold it at a loss, but got a decent amount back for it.

Whilst I sourced a new sofa I added the steel cabinets and put hue light bulbs inside.

I got the Panther lamp from Facebook Marketplace local - it fits PERFECTLY the Miami Vice vibe - used to belong to the actress Pamela Salem who played Miss Moneypenny in Roger Moore's last Bond film, lol.  I then got the custom lampshade made which has a panther/jungle print visible when its lit up.

I was using £1 paper ceiling lamp shades, so replaced them.

I also picked up a few more framed posters to curate the space.  I have one corner that is pop culture influenced.  The Transformers poster was done by my friend, who was commissioned by Hasbro themselves for an official marketing campaign - so it's not a pure geek move.

The other corner has Pacific by Alex Colville, which inspired my favourite movie shot in my favourite movie Heat.  The two prints next to it are self portraits of me.

A Patrick Nagel is almost obligatory, and the Panther one compliments the Panther lamp.  The dream coffee table is an 80s glass top on ceramic black panther......

The red poster at the end was a photo of a friend by me, but I used a Prequel app mode to make that design - think it turned out pretty well.

I got the chair from a vintage place in Romania - it's the Zyklus by Peter Maly for Cor.  Again the turquoise headrest fits the Miami Vice aesthetic and compliments the Panther lamp

And finally the sofa - BOY, could I write a movie about that.

I originally put a deposit down on a  SUPER COMFORTABLE Natuzzi sofa, still the best sofa I've ever sat on.  But, I felt scammed by the sales guy who withheld the second page of the contract from me and didn't disclose the key commercial terms, so didn't want to give them by business.



I started looking at vintage designer sofas to finish off the 80s look.

I found this vintage De Sede designed by Paolo Piva, made from 94-04.  It's in GREAT condition and just got delivered today.  Not as comfy as the Natuzzi for my lounging sitting style but it looks cool and is super unique.  I could only see two others being sold on vintage sites.

The big Bruce Lee poster also arrived today - again I want to keep movie posters to a minimum but this one was sufficiently artistic to merit inclusion.

My biggest peeve about ""tiktok"" apartments is reliance on generic, mass produced art.   My biggest tip for your walls is try to find things that have a story YOU can tell about why that piece appeals to YOU",8,1759327216.0,malelivingspace,0,1.0,False

1nv8ud4,https://www.reddit.com/r/CurrentLiving/comments/1nv8ud4/explore_best_coffee_maker_for_home_use_with_mr/,Explore Best Coffee Maker for Home Use with Mr. Coffee SK13-RB,"The Mr. Coffee SK13-RB has been sitting on my kitchen counter for a few weeks now, and I’ve taken it for a pretty thorough spin. As someone who is perpetually caffeinated, I consider myself somewhat of a coffee machine connoisseur—or at the very least, a very caffeinated critic. This 12-cup drip coffee maker has a straightforward design that instantly promises simplicity, but there’s more lurking beneath its unassuming exterior, both good and not-so-good. Let me just dive into the details.

**Efficient Design and Build Quality**  
At first glance, the coffee maker has a classic black finish that suits any kitchen. Its dimensions make it compact enough to fit into a tight space without dominating the countertop. One feature I found surprisingly helpful is the cord storage—it’s honestly a lifesaver for anyone like me, trying to keep their kitchen clutter-free. The build feels lightweight, which does make it easy to move around, but at just 3.6 pounds, it doesn’t scream ‘durability.’ That said, so far, no signs of wear or instability have crept up despite my daily use.

**Smart Brewing Features**  
What really stood out during my first use was the simple but effective Grab-a-Cup Auto Pause. I mean, who hasn’t been in that situation where they can’t wait for the whole pot to brew before grabbing their first cup of liquid sanity? This feature stops the brewing as soon as you remove the carafe and resumes it right after placing it back. It’s a small yet thoughtful touch that immediately showed how practical this machine was. The indicator light is another nifty inclusion—I don’t have to double-check whether I left the coffee maker running when I’m halfway out the door.

[Check Mr. Coffee SK13-RB price on Amazon.](https://whyjoni.com/p/b002yi2ig0/)

**Consistent Coffee Quality**  
The coffee taste doesn’t leap out at you as if it were made by some high-end machine, yet it holds its own. I mean, it’s a standard drip coffee maker, not a barista. The key here is its consistency. Every single cup—from the first to the twelfth—tastes just as rich and smooth as the one before. The reusable filter basket makes things quite convenient. On regular days, I rely on this feature to save both time and those unnecessary trips to buy disposable filters.

**Positives**  
A few key strengths of this machine deserve attention:  
• Versatile brewing options make it great for brewing for a single cup or a full pot without any compromise.  
• Practical auto-pause feature ensures convenience during rushed mornings.  
• User-friendly removable filter basket streamlines cleaning and filling.  

**Drawbacks**  
Of course, it’s by no means perfect. Some areas where it could improve include:  
• The lightweight plastic build might not feel sturdy enough for long-term, heavy-duty use.  
• Lack of additional advanced settings—no programmable timer, for example, which has become somewhat standard these days.  

**Competing Products**  
If we’re talking about alternatives, let’s bring in a couple of similarly priced drip coffee makers from competitors. There’s the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, known for its dual brewing capabilities (single-serve and pot). While it’s more versatile, its added complexity might intimidate those who value simplicity, and users often report it’s harder to clean. On the other hand, the BLACK+DECKER CM1160B offers similar simplicity but accelerates past this model with its programmable auto-start feature. However, my gripe with the BLACK+DECKER has always been uneven brewing due to inconsistent water dispersion. With the Mr. Coffee SK13-RB, the brew consistency really is its standout strength over such competitors.

**Quality for Price**  
One of the biggest things going for this coffee maker is its affordability. It caters well to those on a budget while delivering solid performance that genuinely feels worth every penny. Sure, you won’t get the bells and whistles of high-end models or the intricate flavor profiles of more sophisticated brewing systems, but what you get here is reliability and a strong return on investment for its simplicity and efficiency. If you’re the kind of person who just wants decent coffee fast and regularly, this machine ticks those boxes.

I dont actually know if im experiencing any symptoms from quitting but my motivation is low and brain fog is high. Im hungrier and my muscles are a bit more sore than usual from gym. 

This could all be attributed to other factors in my life. Anyway. when will i hit the point where i just decide its never gonna be worth it again? Ive done stints of 9 months, 3 months now its been probaby 8 days on in the last month. Ive at least broken the habit of having coffee at home.

This isn’t me getting nervous before a big presentation - this is my body reacting to going to Target like I’m about to get mauled by a wild animal.

What people really don’t get is that anxiety completely rewrites how you exist in the world. I’ve become this hyperaware monitor of my own body, constantly scanning: Is my heart pounding? Am I scrunching my shoulders up again? Why does my stomach feel like I’ve swallowed concrete?

I’ve had to become an unwilling expert in shit I never wanted to learn about. I know exactly which foods will send me into a tailspin (RIP my beloved coffee, I miss you). I know those harsh fluorescent lights can set me off. I know certain smells or random sounds can throw me straight into full-blown panic.

The physical toll is absolutely brutal. My body is literally falling apart - jaw clenched 24/7, back full of knots I can’t work out, immune system completely wrecked. But honestly? The loneliness hurts worse: canceling plans so many times that friends eventually stop asking, sitting in my car for 20 minutes trying to psych myself up to just walk into a damn store, leaving work early because normal everyday sounds suddenly feel like knives in my brain.

But (and this is a huge but)…

I’ve also learned something kind of amazing - I’m way stronger than I ever thought possible. Every single time I manage to do something my anxiety screams is “impossible,” even if it’s the tiniest thing, I’m proving to myself that I CAN actually do this.

I’ve found tools that genuinely work for ME - not that generic ‘just breathe’ bullshit everyone loves to throw around. The Innershield app helped me understand my anxiety patterns in a way years of therapy somehow never did. When panic hits, Rootd’s guided stuff actually pulls me out of that nosedive instead of making everything worse. I’ve learned how to negotiate with my anxious brain instead of just fighting it tooth and nail.

Here’s what matters most: I’ve realized recovery doesn’t mean “never feeling anxious again.” It means building up the confidence that I can handle whatever gets thrown at me. Some days still absolutely suck, but other days I genuinely surprise myself with what I can pull off.

To anyone reading this who’s nodding along: you’re not broken. Your brain is trying to protect you in the most over-the-top way possible, but you can retrain it. It’s gonna take time, you’ll have setbacks that feel like starting over, but every tiny step forward actually counts.

1nv8smc,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivatedMindset/comments/1nv8smc/day_127_clean_the_brutal_truth_about_porn/,Day 127 clean: The brutal truth about porn addiction recovery nobody tells you,"**You're not weak, you're neurologically hijacked. Here's how I actually broke free after 7 years.**

For years, I thought I had zero self-control. Every night I'd promise myself ""last time,"" and every morning I'd wake up feeling like shit—drained, ashamed, foggy. I'd make it 3-4 days, then relapse harder. The cycle felt permanent.

Then I learned something that changed everything: I wasn't weak. My brain had been rewired by supernormal stimuli that evolution never prepared us for. Modern porn delivers dopamine spikes 200-400% higher than actual sex. Your brain can't tell the difference between pixels and reality—it just knows it's getting flooded with reward chemicals.

**Here's what actually worked:**

**The 72-Hour Hell Zone:** Days 1-3 are pure neurochemical withdrawal. Your brain is screaming for its dopamine fix. I had to physically leave my apartment during high-risk times—coffee shops, gym, libraries, anywhere public. The urges peaked around day 2, then started dropping. Just knowing this helped me push through.

**Replace, Don't Erase:** You can't just delete a habit. When urges hit, I'd immediately do 50 pushups or take a freezing shower. The physical shock reset my nervous system. Sounds extreme, but desperation works.

**Nuke Your Triggers:** Website blockers, phone out of bedroom, deleted Instagram (those ""suggested"" posts aren't innocent). I treated my environment like substance abuse recovery—because neurologically, that's what this is.

**The Game-Changer: Accountability That Actually Works:** This is where I'd always failed before. I'd try to white-knuckle it alone, then relapse in secret. What finally worked was having real-time accountability. I found this app that tracks your progress and sends you reminders during your high-risk hours. It's not some AI bullshit—it's designed specifically for breaking addictive patterns. Watching my streak grow became its own dopamine reward, and during those brutal first weeks, having something ping me right when I was about to relapse literally saved me multiple times. I also joined r/pornfree and r/nofap for community support.

**The Chaser Effect:** This one saved me. After a relapse, I'd binge for days thinking ""already failed, fuck it."" Learning this pattern had a name helped me stop the spiral. One slip doesn't erase weeks of healing. Your brain is literally rewiring during clean days.

**The withdrawal was brutal.** Brain fog, irritability, couldn't sleep, felt depressed for two weeks. But around day 21, something shifted. Energy came back. Anxiety dropped. I could look people in the eye. By day 90, I felt like a different person—sharper, more confident, actually present in conversations.

**Real talk:** This addiction doesn't just steal your time. It steals your energy, your focus, your ability to connect with actual humans. Every hour in that cycle is an hour you're not building the life you want.

The shame keeps you trapped. The secrecy keeps you sick. The belief that ""this is just who I am"" keeps you stuck.

But you're not stuck. Neuroplasticity is real. The same pathways that got hijacked can be rewired. Usually takes 90 days minimum for significant changes, sometimes 6-12 months for full reboot, but it's absolutely possible.

I'm not gonna bullshit you—it's hard. I still get urges sometimes. But now I have tools, not just willpower. I understand my triggers. I've built a life where I don't need the escape anymore.

If you're reading this and feeling that pit in your stomach because you relate too hard—start today. Not Monday. Not next week. Right fucking now.

The person you're supposed to be is on the other side of this.

The app I used [This app](https://unnionapp.page.link/QsVV)—it's basically a reminder system that pings you during your vulnerable hours. Sounds simple, but when you're in that autopilot mode at midnight, a well-timed notification can snap you out of it.

Right. So many ways to say that. But read my bio if that helps you better comment. 



With that said…

I guess you can guess the Butch I’m into. Duh. That 1990’s though… 

But…

I wouldn’t be opposed to being with a nonbinary version of the stereotypical 1990’s- Early 2000s Butch that I’m into where the only part of them that is the nonbinary is the pronouns. Like, they still have their periods and are female this; female that otherwise; they just don’t want to be called one. 

(No; not stereotyping. Just to know which I’m talking about; how to explain I don’t know.)


But what would you call that way of Nonbinary seeing as fine with their being a female woman otherwise; just don’t want to be called it? 

Much love to all of you. If you drink coffee I hope it tastes so good. 

Ask if you want me to explain further. I’ll try and do my best. 

Also, please be willing to consider more than one possibility and don’t just jump to conclusions. 

I know how it looks and sounds being the one kind of lesbian into the other one kind of lesbian of all lesbians. I get it all the time from others that 1990’s Grunge; Butch is so outdated and othering.

I am now thirty-three. I couldn’t go about it back then. The only stereotyping I do is to myself. 

But I also happen to love the stuff to Grunge such as the Java, mosaic, grassy field stuff to name a few bits of it. 

I won’t stereotype a Butch with axes and baseball bats; but that also other than you have bigger size and flannel; pixie hair too. I don’t know how to go about this. Much love for real.

1nv8q5c,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nv8q5c,🚀💎🙌 GPUS Update: Even the Suicide Hotline Guy Went All In 🙌💎🚀,"How I accidentally converted a room full of despair into a Bitcoin militia

Reddit keeps handing me crisis hotlines like party favors because I refuse to shut up about GPUS. Fine. I called.
The crisis guy heard my DD and YEETED his entire portfolio into GPUS before I even finished the part about the Michigan facility.

Before hanging up, he says:

“You should go talk to people in person. Here’s a group that meets nearby.”

I’m thinking it’s like a bullish investor meetup.
NOPE.

I pull up to a building that looks like Gotham City unemployment mixed with an abandoned Blockbuster. The walls are the color of depression. The air smells like wet socks and expired soup. The fluorescent lights flicker like they’re running on dial-up. Everybody in there looks like their soul got margin-called.

I sit in this cold metal chair that’s definitely seen at least three divorces and a raccoon fight.

People start sharing:
“My wife left.”
“My job’s gone.”
“My dog won’t even look at me.”
Someone might have just whispered “help” into their coffee.

Then it’s my turn. A single light hits me like God said, “You up?”

I stand up like a war general who accidentally wandered into a basement.

I say:
“I’ve been banned, brigaded, called schizophrenic because I talk about a stock with HARD ASSETS, DATA CENTERS, 400 EMPLOYEES, BITCOIN MINING, BITCOIN BUYING, BITCOIN HOLDING, AND CRANES THE SIZE OF YOUR REGRETS.”

I tell them:
“Mods tried to assassinate me. Admins ignored me. Bots swarmed me. I’ve been shadowbanned so hard I don’t even show up in my own dreams. But I CONTINUE. Because GPUS is THE PLAY.”

I start pacing like a preacher who just chugged three Bang energy drinks.
I’m yelling about loans, revenue, Blackwell tech, meme potential, Michigan facilities so big you could park Congress in there and still have room for bitcoin rigs.

By the end, I’m out of breath, emotionally concussed, spiritually ripped.
I say:
“I have been beaten, banned, bloodied, and blacklisted — my bones cracked, my teeth rattling like loose change — but NOTHING will convince me this isn’t the buy of the century.”

Silence.
Then it happens.

One guy stands up. Slow clap.
Then another.
And another.
Until the whole damn circle is on their feet like I just cured sadness.

One yells:

“F*** my retirement plan, I’m going all in!”
Another whispers:
“You’ve given me a reason to live and a ticker to buy.”
Someone in the back:
“I sold my emotional support ferret for more shares.”

They THANK me. For saving their lives.
They tell me they’re with me.
They’re buying. They’re spreading the gospel.

I walked in a wounded man.
I walked out leading a GPUS infantry.

⸻

To the mods, bots, admins, bears, shadowbanners, and self-appointed Reddit psychiatrists:

You can send me hotlines.
You can exile me from your subs.
You can put 19 sniper scopes on my skull.

But you CANNOT stop the launch sequence.

——FOR THE POST AHEAD: I will be sharing something personal. Please keep an open mind——

So, here’s the thing. I am in my early 30s. I had 4 relationships before and now I’m single. I want to choose my next partner properly. My ex boyfriends loved me and treated me well. But they were manipulative, and we are just headed at the same direction.

Now I’m dating again. I learned that age does not qualify how mature a person is. I’ve dated many times. I’m serious when it comes to relationships, so i met them for coffee or dinner lang. With just one meeting, I already know that they are not the one.

I have standards and I don’t care if some people will say they are steep. All I’m looking for is someone i can call my equal. Kaya lang, the more I explore, the more I come to a realization na parang walang pag-asa. Men will always be boys.

I’m happy with just being single, except for one thing. And a very important thing. I have a high libido. I always enjoyed doing it and i miss it so much. I hate doing it alone though.

first, i just want to emphasize something. RCPD ruined so many days and nights for me. Dates, big events, concerts, hanging out with friends, etc. before i discovered what it was i prayed for some sort of cure. when i discovered the botox procedure there was no doubt in my mind about getting it, even as someone who has had horrible emetephobia my whole life. RCPD truly made me feel disabled, it was that bad. 
I went under for it and got 80 units, i recommend going under because they can inject more and do both sides. when i woke up i couldn’t stop coughing because of a tickle in my throat that wouldn’t go away. that was probably the most annoying part of recovery. sure, the next 2 weeks are definitely interesting, but NOTHING to be afraid of. i got my life back. something as simple and silly as burping literally changed my life. I don’t get painfully bloated at ALL anymore. I can drink, smoke, have coffee, go out to dinner, talk for hours on end, without having to lay down like a sick 90 year old after. i have literally laid down at clubs before because it got so bad. 
honestly, this whole experience made me so grateful that there is some kind of treatment and that it actually works. burping is fun, and it feels really good. you learn more about your body in the process, and no getting botox does not mean you will throw up. this whole process has actually helped a lot with my emetephobia. 
it can be very daunting reading posts and going on anxious spirals in your head… trust me i have been there. but if your RCPD is bad enough and you have the means to get treatment, DO IT. don’t allow your fear to stop you from having a remarkably better quality of life.

So for background: I’m 21F and I moved into a house with five bedrooms in May. In the area I live in, the rent was too good to pass up and it’s in a great area, so I was able to overlook the fact that I was living with all men, and honestly after I met them all I rly assumed the best of them. 
We have Mike: M33, Jesús: M30, Justin: M30, Colin: M28, and Ty: M(idk maybe 20’s)

Mike and Jesus live on the top floor in bedrooms next to me, Justin and Colin on the main floor below us, and Ty in the basement ( I literally never see him)

I immediately got along super well with Jesus and Justin, and I trust them a lot. They go out of their way to make sure I’m not uncomfortable and they spend time to themselves a lot. Mike on the other hand was very forward with me within a week of moving in. He’s deaf and would type things on his phone and hand it to me to read and that’s how we would talk, so I think I put up with more then I should have cuz I felt bad he had to communicate that way, I guess I kind of thought maybe none of the other guys talked to him so I would let him chat with me a lot. Well the messages got increasingly creepier and he started commenting on my body, asking if I wanted to grab coffee, was gonna grab wine for chats after work, etc. At this time I shut it down and let him know it was weird age wise and also weird bc he knew I was seeing someone.
He said he would leave me alone (he kinda did) but there was a few instances of him still trying to talk to me in the kitchen or catch me on the stairs, but I’d usually shut it down.

Okay so today: I left my house at 9am this morning. I go in and out of my room several times before I leave because I try on different outfits and the only mirror is all the way downstairs. So I would have noticed anything that didn’t belong to me sitting smack in the middle of my bedroom.
I went to school ALL DAY (block classes, ugh) and came home about 9:30pm. I open my bedroom door and FIRST THING I NOTICE is a huge pair of black slippers smack in the middle of my room. Like literally placed perfectly so it’s the first thing I’d see. They ARE NOT MINE. I immediately call down to Justin who was watching tv in the living room and I asked him if he had been in my room, he obvs said no. I then text Jesus and he also says no, sounds confused and then opens his door and sees me standing in front of the shoes. Then he goes “wtf those are mine. Why are my shoes in ur room?”

At first I had assumed maybe he left them there by accident dropping a package on my bed or something and (the room is a terrible mess so he could’ve taken his shoes off as to not step on anything to get to my bed) he smokes a lot of pot and maybe he was super high and left them there? But he would’ve just said that, also, no package in my room.

Then they immediately thought of Mike because Colin was gone all day, Ty doesn’t come upstairs, and Justin had just gotten home and they all left before I did earlier this morning. The landlord checked the cameras and no one else had come in or out. That leaves only Mike and Jesus at home, and Jesus was gone for like four hours from 2-6. I really don’t see Jesus doing this… so that would leave Mike.

First, Jesus asked Mike over text in private, and he said no. So I asked the groupchat, everyone said no. Everyone kind of tried to laugh it off, only Jesus and my landlord seemed actually upset and Colin seemed a little worried.

After that died down, I got a knock at my door while I was changing in my room. I opened the door and Mike was standing there and he had typed out asking if I was doing okay. I said yes and then he asked me if I had ever seen one of “these” and grabs a key off the top of my door. Turns out I have a key on top of my door that unlocks doors from the outside, my mom said they are called bathroom keys?? Well then he proceeds to type out that he’s had privacy issues too and to use this or something. I just said thanks and closed the door. For some reason that weirded me out more and also NO ONE SAID I HAD A KEY ON THE TOP OF MY DOOR THAT OPENS MY BEDROOM FROM
THE OUTSIDE TIL NOW???

So now I’m at a loss here. Are we thinking Mike? And if so, wtf was the purpose? I don’t see any underwear missing but I do have a sex toy that sits on my desk next to my bed. Could he have gone in to do something creepy? Should I confront him? Can someone tell me from the outside what this sounds/looks like??

Thank you so much and sorry for the long question.

TL;DR: 5 male roommates, moved in in May, Mike asked me out I said no, Shoes left in my bedroom while I was gone, concerned it may be Mike but not sure if the reason for them being there is malicious or not.",1,1759326098.0,roommateproblems,0,1.0,False

It’s called mystery shopping, and yes, it’s legit.

Here are three types of tasks that fit seamlessly into your routine:

**🛒 1. Supermarket Service Check**

You’re already buying milk and cereal, why not get paid to evaluate the checkout experience?

What you do: Observe how staff greet customers, check for cleanliness, and note how long it takes to pay.

Time required: 20-25 minutes

Payout range: Around $20

No need to buy anything extra. You submit a short report afterward, usually via a mobile app or desktop form.

**🍔 2. Quick-Service Restaurant Visit**

Picking up lunch? Some shops pay you to visit fast food chains or casual dining spots.

What you do: Order a meal, assess staff friendliness, food presentation, and cleanliness.

Time required: 25-30 minutes

Payout range: FREE food for 2 + $10 Flat Pay

You’re not pretending to be someone else. You’re just a regular customer with a checklist.

**🚗 3. Car Oil Change Task**

Getting your car serviced?

Auto service centers often want feedback on how staff handle basic service inquiries. Ask simple questions about an oil change (e.g., “How long does it take?” or “Do you offer synthetic oil?”), observe how staff respond, and check for clear signage, pricing visibility, and service bay cleanliness.

Time required: 1.5hrs 

Payout range: $10 + FREE Oil Change

These tasks are usually low-pressure and don’t require purchases.

✅ Final Thoughts

Mystery shopping isn’t a full-time income stream, but it’s a smart way to earn while doing what you’re already doing.

The key is choosing tasks that match your routine and submitting reports that are clear and honest.",1,1759326004.0,SecretShopperInc,0,1.0,False
1nv8h8v,https://www.reddit.com/r/shiftingrealities/comments/1nv8h8v/i_shifted_to_mcu_for_4_years/,I shifted to MCU for 4 years 🦸🏻,"I’m back here in my Better CR.

Technically, I’m not back, because I’ve never been to this CR before. Still, this reality is the same as my CR, but now I’m able to shift on command.

And I’ve already tested it. It works. No more failed attempts for me and trying out every method in existence.

Let’s get my method out of the way, so I can talk about my experience a bit.

I shifted before falling asleep, just daydreamed before bed with my mind awake. I gradually and naturally started to feel disconnected from my body and when I did, I tried out my shifting command. And suddenly, it worked.

I got into the void. Completely aware one, just the way I always imagined how the true void would feel. 

It feels like you are one with the absolute blackness, unhurried and fully focused.
Once there I immediately felt at peace and I was confident that I could experience whatever I want.

I had several DRs on my mind, but I remembered that I was focused on MCU now, so I just decided to be there and I did.

I was awake there, but still in my bed. In my MCU DR I was blinking at the moment, looking at my forearm resting on grey sheets, but at the same time, I just shifted for the first time.

I remember smiling and just lazing in my bed, which was this ridiculously ginormous cloud-like thing that dwarfed me.

Funny thing, I had this “rich people are crazy” thought coming to me randomly all week. Don’t get me wrong, it was natural for me to sleep on this huge bed with seven pillows, but at the same time, I had experience and memories of almost falling asleep on my couch with a thin blanket on me. This version of me, spoiled with comfort for all my life, was so different from my CR one, but it still was me. It’s hard to explain. This strange two-life existence. It was great actually, like I knew more than others, like this amazing secret that I had. I had incredible experience and knowledge of shifting, I couldn’t stop this mysterious smile I had on my face whenever I thought about it.

I stayed silent about shifting, though…until five months in, but it’s a different story.

Let me tell you about that first day for a bit more.

I got up and just did my usual routine, at the same time I remember just being giddy with excitement while trying to appear nonchalant about what just happened. I had Jarvis there, so I didn’t want him asking why I was giggling like a maniac. He has this butler-like protocol when he would ask about your mood and plans for the day and coney it to others, so I tried not to focus on the fact that I just truly “won at life” and from now on I am going to experience whatever I want.

I remember that after I thought about breakfast, I immediately pictured a whole row of different, colourful miniature French desserts that I’ve never seen or tasted when I was in my CR, but this version of me was obsessed with them. And I knew all their names with the right pronunciation. I was thinking about what kind of berries I wanted on top of my tart and at the same time I was amazed at the whole thing and how I was even known at the cafeteria to always start my morning ordering sweets with coffee.

One more major difference I’ve noticed after I thought about desserts and thought back on my usual mornings. I never drink black coffee in my OR, but this version of me preferred to start the day with a small espresso that had more flavour in it than I ever tasted in my CR’s coffee.

It’s truly unfair how comfortable and fun rich life is.

I definitely enjoyed my coffee that morning. And the tart I chose was delicious with it.
This whole day I mostly thought about my life there and how I could try out my powers without being suspicious. I knew that those magic powers only now manifested (there is whole long explanation to this, I’m not going to go into details), so I didn’t want to give myself away.

I procrastinated for three days with this task, but when I did it, it was amazing. My powers manifested in cosmic-like hues, I was literally creating whatever I could imagine with my magic. I was too overpowered and I felt unstoppable. I created a small blackhole with all the beauty of one and none actual gravitational power, so it was harmless. It danced around my arm until I magicked it away. At that time I was still somewhat paranoid of revealing my power, so I didn’t test it much at first. Fast forward one and a half years afterwards and I was creating and “decorating” a whole new planet to present to my parents as a gift for their wedding anniversary. And media even covered it. It was crazy, good crazy of course, just the way I like it.

Why did I go back? The answer is easy. I felt like it. I wasn’t sad or worried about my CR, just nostalgic and somewhat curious to see what it would be like to experience it for a bit before going back to a certain crazy life-changing event in MCU. I don’t really want to talk about it as it is yet to happen, it’s a good thing, a life’s milestone for me, but the whole significance of it made me think about my CR more. So I sat on a chair one day in front of the tv and used my shifting command.

Again I briefly experienced the same void and I held my focus on CR, not letting myself think of other DRs I could experience now. I was tempted for a bit with other possibilities, but my nostalgia won.

Here I am and I am excited to stay here for a bit. I’m not sure for how long, I can shift anytime now, so it doesn’t really matter.

So I just ate a bad of chips, watched YouTube for a bit and started on Hades 2 before deciding on typing out this post.

# Notes

\* You can easily make you own oat flour, using instant oats or rolled oat. use coffee grinder or food processor, whatever works best, and gives you a fine texture.  
\*\* I used regular dark chocolate chips, you can use any vegan ones. I have not used vegan chocolate chips, but they don't affect the texture of cookies, so I didn't experiment with them.  
\*\*\*I prefer you make your own peanut butter, even natural one may has added salt or oil, and it may affect the texture of cookies.  
\*\*\*\*I have not used any other plant milk. But cashew milk, and almond milk, should work too, but I have NOT tested it .",3,1759325954.0,glutenfreevegan,0,1.0,False

I know I probably sound rlly dramatic worrying about this but Ive just gotten a can of passionfruit oxyshred for free and Im wanting to try it out but Im a bit nervous.
Ive gone to the gym casually in the past but really been starting to lock in on it the past few weeks. I never use pre workout, I used it once about a year ago and found it kinda meh (but it was a different brand) however I know my friend has tried other pre workouts too and seems to always get really hot and itchy, I know this is more because of beta-alanine which oxyshred doesn’t contain but I’m still a bit skeptical. I would hate to get to the gym and feel uncomfortable or nauseous(another symptom Ive heard people talk about.) for reference I barely drink caffeine, I probably have one coffee a week and am worried that this may also make me feel a bit yuck? should I take drink it on an empty stomach or have a snack first? just let me know ur options x once again I know it’s probably not that deep but was looking to hopefully ease my nerves a bit lol",0,1759325952.0,PetiteFitness,1,0.33,False

1nv8gvt,https://www.reddit.com/r/ibs/comments/1nv8gvt/i_stopped_waking_up_at_3am_to/,I stopped waking up at 3am to 💩,"I live in Ecuador and had been suffering for years from sudden bowel changes... From constipation to massive diarrhea. I had a constan pain in the right side of my lower back that extended to my hip. I felt bloated all the time and my belly just kept getting bigger and bigger, even when I was eating the same. 

I went to 5 different doctors, and none could come up with the crazy idea that I might suffer from IBS.
I discovered it myself after reading all your posts, and doing some research on my own.

For the past 2 months I started waking up every day at 3 am to go to the toilet. It took me around an hour each time to evacuate... If we can call it that, because what it came out was too little for all the effort I put in (I'm sorry if this is too graphic, I just want everyone who reads how frustrating that was).

After the visit to the toilet, I could not go back to sleep... You can only imagine how incredibly exhausted I got.

I tried everything to help me sleep: valeriana, camomile tea, cbd oil, melanin... You name it. 
Nothing worked. 

I had entirely lost hope on local doctors, but I needed someone to help me recover my sleep. 
In the end, I went to a neurologist that prescribed sleeping pills which worked for exactly a week. After that, I continued with my new acquired skill of waking up at 3 am. 

I read a lot about high cortisol levels are connected to the bowel, so I decided to take matters in my own hands. 

I changed my diet entirely and after the second day I ate differently, I haven't woken up at 3 am again. 

I know is different for everyone, but I hope this can help someone.

This is what I did:

1. Even when I love coffee, I stopped drinking it. Every now and then, I take a sip from my bf's cup. 
No more than that. 
I used to drink around 3 cups a day. 

2. I cut out all processed foods. If I didn't cook it from scratch, I don't eat it.

3. I cut out milk. I now have kefir or natural yogurt. No added flavours or sugars. 

4. No sugar.

5. No pasta or bread that I didn't make myself. 
I do my own dough and that one doesn't hurt my bowel.

5. I increased the intake of animal protein and vegetables. 

6. I increased the intake of oats and wax seed whenever I could. 

7. I still eat rice. 

8. I don't add onions and garlic to my meals.

After doing that for just 2 days, it all stopped. I feel so much better. No waking up at 3 am, no more bloated, constipation... A full 180.

I understand that I'm very privileged because I own my business and I work from home so I can cook A LOT, which is very time consuming... But it was the solution I could find for myself. 

I hope anyone who read this understands that even when I cut out a lot from my regular diet, the results are absolutely worth it. 

With all of this, I'm not saying that nobody should visit an specialist. On the contrary. That's the first thing you should do. And I hope you are lucky and find a very good one. 

But also, and most importantly, trust yourself. 
You know your body and you can see what's hurting you. 
Take that out from your diet and you should see improvements. 

I hope this helps someone.

1nv8gjy,https://www.reddit.com/r/MedicalAssistant/comments/1nv8gjy/most_embarrassing_interview/,Most embarrassing interview,"You guys... I went to an interview for a medical assistant, but we met up at Starbucks. The interviewers were late so I ordered a coffee, called to ensure they were on their way, and waited. It was super cold in the building, and I was very nervous and was getting a little antsy in my seat while I was waiting... 

My point:
I think my skirt somehow got caught in my panty hose. There is a good possibility I was flashing everyone in Starbucks, and my two interviewers. I honestly can't say for sure - I know my skirt was fine when I arrived, but now I can't really be sure of anything. It's a blur. 

I was way too nervous. When they arrived,  I accidentally walked away from my purse with all my belongings, until I remembered about 5 minutes later and had to go retrieve it from the original table I was at. Then, because it was cold, we moved outside and I left my purse AGAIN. The interviewer grabbed it and brought it with her. I was so disorganized, and that's not even normal for me, but the circumstances of meeting at Starbucks wasn't normal for me either for an MA interview. 

I've honestly been checking the internet to see if someone recorded a stupid lady flashing everyone at Starbucks. 

I hope it was just after the interview. I sat down on my couch when I got home and was petting my dog and moving a lot, and when I got up I noticed my skirt tucked in, so hopefully it was not like that the whole time, but again, now that it happened at all - got caught the perfect way so I was flashing the left cheek - I just can't be sure of anything. 

You'd think they'd say something if it was. Pull me aside and mention. Someone would, right? It was probably not as bad as I think. I can't stop replaying it though. What if? 

I've been an MA for 15 years and have never done so poorly at an interview. I don't know what happened. ",4,1759325915.0,MedicalAssistant,0,1.0,False
1nv8ft3,https://i.redd.it/hvzwffmk4isf1.png,Hotfix 1.10.3 is now LIVE! - Not for Problem Reports!,"(If you prefer reading on the forums, click [here](https://pdxint.at/4pPoHzb)!)

Hello Victorians, we have a rather large hotfix for you today.

Featuring the GDFIX changes, a variety of fixes, balance changes, interface improvements and more. This is less of a hotfix and more of a hugefix…

The temporary fix we introduced in 1.10.1 for Silesia being annexed by Prussia during a Polish Uprising has now been resolved properly instead of through the temporary fix too.

Check out the full patchnotes below. Checksum is \`81b8\`.

As always please report any bugs on [our bug reporting forums](https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/forums/victoria-3-bug-reports.1114/)! We have also updated the [Known Issues post for 1.10](https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/known-issues-update-1-10.1859597/) with fixed issues!



The following changes have been made to the game compared to 1.10.2:

# Improvements

* \[GDFIX\] Made colonization ignore population of source state when determining speed penalty (thank you Alxe for the suggestion)
* \[GDFIX\] Added option when releasing a nation to keep states considered homelands for your primary cultures (thank you Deutsches Kaiserreich for the suggestion)
* \[GDFIX\] Military wages now also affect the prestige gain from Navy power projection (thanks Tony for the suggestion)
* \[GDFIX\] When enforced as part of a peace agreement or capitulation during war, the Independence war goal now also automatically also nationalizes overlord-held building levels (thank you BamBam for the suggestion)
* \[GDFIX\] The 'September Convention' treaty name template now names the treaty dynamically after the month it was signed in instead of it always being September (thank you Martin Anward aka Wiz, for suggesting your own fix I suppose…)
* It is now possible for companies to 'privatize' buildings under Command Economy
* The Defend against Invasion button now works even if the invasion hasn't started yet. If the front for the invasion hasn't spawned, it will station the formation in the target HQ for the invasion, if the invasion has started and the front exists, it will deploy the formation directly to the front
* Generals will now also join defensive invasion battles and not simply send their troops if stationed as a garrison in an HQ
* Partial Shopkeeper/Academic-owned companies now pay 25% of their dividends to the workforce in their owned buildings
* Partial Bureaucrat-owned companies now pay 25% of their dividends to the government
* Reworked how Ideological Incoherence is calculated. You should now generally have an easier time forming single-party governments and governments which disagree on minor issues, and a harder time forming massive governments with strong and conflicting opinions
* Reworked the logic for cultural and religious secessions - states with low percentages of the relevant pops will be much less inclined to secede, unless their Obstinance or Turmoil is particularly high
* The South American National Identity Journal Entries now trigger a National Awakening for their respective cultures
* Adjusted demographics for the Baltic States, Lithuania, and Poland to reflect the historical makeup of their aristocracies
* Increased the Activism of the Polish National Movement in Russia whilst the Organic Statute of 1832 is active
* Adjusted demographics for Ireland to reflect the historical demography of its Aristocrats, Soldiers and Officers pops

# AI

* The AI will now be less inclined to conquer non-homeland or non-claimed states that it does not share a land border or strategic region with
* Reduced the AI's base desire to unify Germany and Italy in the early game
* The AI will be much more inclined to spend money on economic buildings when it has the Industrialise AI strategy, or during the Gründerzeit
* Brought the aggression of the Unify Italy diplomatic strategy into line with the Unify Germany strategy
* Added a new Montenegro AI strategy to ensure it keeps its trade centres subsidised

# Balance

* \[GDFIX\] Made colonization speed account for paused colonies (thank you Alxe for the suggestion)
* \[GDFIX\] Added a lot of Obsessions to various cultures (thanks Tony for the suggestion)
* \[GDFIX\] Political Movement support from Wealth now scales against the political strength from wealth levels, meaning that the support of a single wealthy individual is much more significant than support from a large number of poor individuals (thank you rskhm | BPM for the suggestion))
* \[GDFIX\] The 'Force Nationalization' wargoal now requires you to control all your own states instead of requiring you to occupy the enemy capital (thank you to BamBam for the suggestion)
* \[GDFIX\] GDP owned by your country in other countries now counts towards the reinvestment multiplier, so that a country with a massive investment pool from foreign holdings will not have it artificially boosted further (thank you to Blackpoolgo4it2 for the suggestion)
* \[GDFIX\] Machinists and Engineers now contribute to the Investment Pool under economic setups where they receive dividends (thank you to CaelReader for the suggestion)
* \[GDFIX\] Added Grocery taboo to Jewish religion to reflect their dietary restrictions (thanks nullpotato for the suggestion)
* \[GDFIX\] Added Rye throughput bonus to the Ursus Company (thanks germaniec7 for the suggestion)
* \[GDFIX\] The Launch Military Incursions decision in the Conquest of the Desert now requires Logistics instead of Civilizing Mission, and adds some infamy when taken (thank you Heinrich IV for the suggestion)
* \[GDFIX\] Haiti starts with Homesteading now (thank you immeska for the suggestion)
* \[GDFIX\] Removed Rice Farm potentials from Hokkaido (thank you to markus for the suggestion)
* \[GDFIX\] Increased Wood potentials throughout Sweden, Norway, Canada, and the Northern and Western United States (thank you to markus for the suggestion)
* \[GDFIX\] Increased Iron potentials for Norrland and Svealand (thank you to markus for the suggestion)
* \[GDFIX\] Added Vineyard potentials to Tyrol, Bavaria, and Delvidek (thank you to markus for the suggestion)
* \[GDFIX\] Added Tobacco potentials to Wisconsin, Indiana, New York, Pastaza, and Mosul(thank you to markus for the suggestion)
* \[GDFIX\] Removed Rye potentials from Oulu, Kola, and Yakutsk, and added Rye potential to Outer Manchuria (thank you to markus for the suggestion)
* \[GDFIX\] Added Iron and Sulphur potentials to Cyprus (thank you to markus for the suggestion)
* \[GDFIX\] Added Fruit potentials to Pastaza (thank you to markus for the suggestion)
* \[GDFIX\] Added Rubber potentials to Antioquia and Cauca (thank you to markus for the suggestion)
* \[GDFIX\] Added Coffee potential to Goias (thank you to markus for the suggestion)
* Austria is no longer able to revoke the Hungarian Twelve Points without pushback by using the Regime Change power bloc interaction
* Increased acceptance of primary cultures under Subjecthood to 100. This should fix cases of discrimination events firing for primary cultures under Subjecthood
* Peasants now get far fewer loyalists & radicals from Standard of Living changes
* The amount of radicals/loyalists gained from Standard of Living increases now starts scaling down after level 15, as each successive SoL level after that represents diminishing returns in actual impact on a pop's perceived quality of life, and it was previously far too easy to turn your entire upper class loyalist
* Buildings with foreign owners will now generally pay lower wages (relative to foreign-owned level fraction), as said foreign owners don't really care all that much if their wage dumping creates radicals in other nations
* Increased Movement Activism modifier from the Springtime of the Peoples Journal Entry from 25% to 35%, and added a -50% enactment time modifier to both Springtime of the Peoples and Red Summer Journal Entries
* Manorialism is now only enabled for Austrian Crown Land or Personal Union-type subjects
* Replaced the additional company slot from the canal companies with a free charter. The company slots often proved to be more of a curse than a blessing since when you lost the prosperity bonus, you could end up in a downward spiral. Additionally, the other bonuses they provide are so much more effective than the pre 1.9 competitiveness bonus that we believe they should still be viable with the addition of the charter. As always we'll keep an eye on feedback on this.
* Serbia now has Homesteading at game start
* Buildings are now more stingy with their wages when no minimum wages are set
* Made starting Hungarian revolutionaries immune to Memento Mori effects until 1856
* Increased starting Italian radicals for Austria
* Increased the attraction of Hungarian Aristocrats towards the Intelligentsia Interest Group and Liberal Movement whilst the Hungarian Revolution Journal Entry is active
* Reduced the maximum and minimum impacts of Fervour on attraction to various cultural movements
* Cultural Minority Movements under Subjecthood are no longer affected by base cultural acceptance. Instead, they are affected by average cultural acceptance of pops of the relevant culture
* Pop attraction to National Liberal movements is now affected by pop literacy
* Reduced the penalty to Devout attraction from literacy, as they were overly penalized in the late game
* Removed the max institution level increase from Secret Police/Guaranteed Liberties and put it behind Central Planning and Mass Surveillance techs instead, so that it isn't so easy to counter movement radicalism early on. The effects of National Guard were slightly reduced as this means National Guard can now be increased to level 5 in the late game
* Added additional Activism factors to National Liberal movements
* Increased the base attraction of Aristocrats, Clerks, and Academics to cultural minority movements, and reduced the base attraction of Clergymen
* Increased base political strength from votes to be more in line with the generally increased wealth levels across the game. Society techs that increase Authority now also increase voting power further
* Reduced the impact executives have on interest group political strength, and increased the number of building levels a company must own to get the maximum effect
* Removed an outdated supply increase modifier that came into effect when a formation was mobilized. This was invisible to the player, so we replaced it with higher good cost increases on the supply mobilization options. Overall values should remain largely the same
* The Age of Metternich Journal Entry now requires 25% revolution progress, or a successful Springtime of the Peoples revolution
* Various pro-slavery ideologies will now oppose enacting Colonial Slavery when a more slavery-friendly law is active
* Montenegro will need to learn to respect women before enacting advanced economy laws \\\[blocked the enactment of non-Traditionalism or Industry Banned economy laws whilst Women in the Fields is active\\\]
* The alternate complete condition of The Algerian Departments now requires the Amazigh and Maghrebi cultures to be above 40 average acceptance, and the Sunni religion to be above 15 average acceptance
* Building Minimum Wages modifier is now spread over multiple different institutions
* Moved max Social Security investment level modifiers from Welfare laws to tech
* Moved max Health System investment level modifiers from Health System laws to tech
* Reduced Individualist and Market Liberal ideologies' tolerance of the Right to Associate law
* Made the various variants of the Liberal ideology approve of National Guard, and disapprove of No Home Affairs
* Made the various variants of the Liberal ideology disapprove of Censorship, neutral towards Right of Assembly, and approve of Protected Speech
* Moved the ""Sorbia is Serbia"" achievement to the Hard achievements category
* Under Census Voting, pops can now vote from wealth 10 (down from 15)
* Under Wealth Voting, pops can now vote from wealth 20 (down from 25)
* Changed the arable land threshold for a state to be eligible for mass migration from 20 to 10
* Increased the base attraction of Officers and Soldiers to the Absolutist Movement
* Reduced the base attraction of Peasants to the Labour Movement
* Positivist characters may now support the Liberal Movement
* Clergymen are no longer affected by the literacy-related malus towards the Religious Majority and Minority Movements
* Increased starting Ottoman gold reserves
* Lahej now starts with a Trade Center exporting coffee
* The ""Legacy of the Commonwealth"" attraction modifier for Polish pops to cultural minority movements now only applies to Aristocrats
* Countries with Anarchy may no longer enact Extraction Economy

# Art

* Added DNA to Marshal Radetzky von Radetz, courtesy of Lord R of Morgenröte
* Improved the colouring of Serbian military caps

# Content

* \[GDFIX\] Added Yankee homelands to District of Columbus, Maryland, Delaware and West Virginia (thanks DonQuijote for the suggestion)
* \[GDFIX\] Added a chain of succession for all French dynasties (thanks The Watcher (F.E.) for the suggestion)
* \[GDFIX\] Changed Savoy and Piedmont's hub and state names to be Italian by default. They will switch to the french version once controlled by France (thanks Il Fop for the suggestion)
* Added the People of the Book law, a generic version of the Ottoman Millet System for Muslim countries (because this is too exciting to wait until 1.12 for)
* Added anti-overlord lobbies to Serbia and the Danubian Principalities
* Changed the Springtime of the Peoples and Divided Monarchists revolution events to be based on whether one's capital is going to join a Revolution
* Added pro- and anti-overlord lobbies to Hungary
* Added pro- and anti-Hungary lobbies to Transylvania
* Changed the non-Sardinia-Piedmont Italian states' Citizenship laws to Subjecthood
* Added additional flags for Montenegro, and corrected the starting flag
* Added Yemeni Highlands state trait to Yemen
* Added some missing German dynamic state names (e.g. Franconia is now called Franken if owned by German speaking population)



# Interface

* \[GDFIX\] Disabled spam of notifications for when someone joins a diplomatic play and they have tons of subjects (thank you Ilya for the suggestion)
* \[GDFIX\] Added a player countries map mode (thank you Drasp for the suggestion)
* \[GDFIX\] Fixed the state interface so we show correct goods contribution to gdp % (thank you balticšprott | IEX for the suggestion)
* \[GDFIX\] You can now see information about foreign GDP ownership in the GDP tooltip (thank you Blackpoolgo4it2 for the suggestion)
* \[GDFIX\] The pop list movement support display now provides an accurate number and a correct breakdown tooltip (thank you to rskhm | BPM for the suggestion)
* \[GDFIX\] Laws with/without government support are now sorted in order of highest chance to enact instead of lowest (thank you for the suggestion acranmer10)
* Tweaked the investment log tooltip layout for better readability
* Added the ""Players"" map mode to the map mode list in the Diplomacy panel
* Added a new National Awakening map marker tooltip to be clearer of what the map marker stands for
* Made the religion map mode automagically appear when you click the Religion tab on the Society panel
* Added a decimal to the infrastructure from population modifier on the basic Forestry company, so we can see the actual value (0.7) rather than 0

* Improved the tooltips for effects of pro- and anti-overlord lobbies on Liberty Desire

* Fixed the Movement Suppressed After Civil War modifier icons being the wrong colours

# Modding

* Added country\_block\_government\_reform\_bool modifier which blocks a country from reforming their government
* remove\_modifier now looks up the timed modifier for it's multiplier when building descriptions. This means we correctly describe the expedition budgets in the JE's failure/complete state descriptions.

# Bugfixes

* \[GDFIX\] Fixed an issue where various left-wing ideologies would not properly weight Serfdom in political party calculations (thank you CaesarVincens for the suggestion)
* \[GDFIX\] The Fascist leader ideology now requires Political Agitation instead of Mass Propaganda, to bring it in line with the requirements for the Fascist Movement (thank you CaelReader for the suggestion)

I’ve never done insta marketing so I’m also learning from scratch, but I’m a creative so it’s been a fun process. We started around 470 followers and since I’ve been posting we’re at a little over 100 new followers in the last 1.5 months (some organic, some from boosted reels), I feel like our like count is still pretty low though(wondering if I should hide likes?). 

I live in a small, beautiful, tropical island with a population of about 100,000. This is important as I’m not 100% sure how to position us. We’re the only roastery in the country, so our main competition is imported brands. We’re trying to move into supplying for hotels (huge tourist population that comes here, so that’s our main objective). We want to present as luxury, educational and high end on social media , but I also feel like the most engaging content is behind the scenes, recipes, beauty of the islands etc (from personal opinion on what I like to watch). I don’t just want follows I want to get people engaged and excited to buy our coffee (it’s really damn good lol).

**RANT TIME!**  
  
 Staggered crosswalks are SO FUCKING STUPID like holy crap. So there I am on an electric scooter and just scootin' around and having a good time and, OH NO, I need to... GASP... cross the road! So I look for all the spots to cross a road and, OH THANK GOODNESS! There's a fucking stupid ass fucking STAGGERED CROSSWALK with a REFUGE ZONE! So I go up to the staggered crosswalk, press my dumb fuck beg button, pick my nose staring up at the sky as the yellow light starts blinking.   
  
For the moment, I can see there is a big yellow sign showing a guy walking, then yellow lights powered by solar panel arrays blinking like crazy to let the asshole in the Ford F-250 with a raised truck to fucking stop, but lets fucking face it, they're not going to stop because they made numerous life decisions rendering all people around them effectively traffic cones to swerve through to get to their goal, is just going to ignore the yellow lights and the man walking yellow sign AND the wonderful arrow pointing down at the crosswalk in case the truck driver needs to know WHERE the people will walk as opposed to float in the fucking sky to go across the street, completely IGNORE every single one of these things and simply DRIVE PAST avoiding the need to WAIT 5 SECONDS for someone to cross the street!  
  
 So I wait for that guy to go... and then I begin to cross the street, and, oh, THANK GOODNESS we got ourselves the civil engineers to fix this problem for us! We found ourselves in the fucking stupid ass REFUGE ISLAND! Ah, just what I needed as a pedestrian that already has too much walking involved because of the size of parking ass lots, MORE WALKING to get to the other side! Might as well get ourselves a tent, a couch, make ourselves a coffee, have a conversation in the MIDDLE OF THE FUCKING LOUD ASS ROAD on our wonderful refuge island and turn, walk to the other side of the REFUGE ISLAND, and then finally, cross, hoping to God, Shiiva, Ahura Mazda, the Buddha, that the other asshat in a Ford F-250 is also going to stop, and then, phew!   
  
I can cross! Wow. this was an amazing venture! Allow me to then take a bit of a fucking note out of Pythagoras and completely fucking ignore this stupid ass overengineered nightmare and simply hypoteneuse my ass across the fucking street because it's such a cumbersome mess to even deal with! It's this kind of car-centric infrastructure that DRIVES ME INSANE!   
  
How about this... and hear me out... and it is going to sound crazy, why not... and hear me the fuck out... A RAISED FUCKING CROSSWALK TO ENSURE NOBODY CAN ROAR PAST IN THEIR STUPID ASS F-250 if there REALLY is that much fucking foot traffic REQUIRING a god damn STAGGERED ASS CROSSWALK!?

**TL;DR:**

Staggered crosswalks are terrible and put the onus on pedestrians to watch out and drive instead of drivers having to slow down on purpose making things safer for everyone. Raised crosswalks are better in literally every way possible and requires much less engineering.",34,1759325560.0,fuckcars,20,0.95,False

This summer (Like I said first time listener so it wasnt the best time) I planted 3 Darrows, 2 highbush, simpsonstopper, 2 wild coffee, 2 tea bush and 3 firebush, and my wife wanted a bougainvillea.

Here's the issue. Ive been using picture this because I dont know i dont know what im doing.  I didnt add fertilizer because I didnt want to fry my plants because due to my ignorance.  However, according to picturethis app it says pathogens are laying claim to over half my plants.

Ive tried some stuff but I have no idea what I should do.  Im tempted to just wait and see what happens with them next spring and let nature take its course.  One big question I have is, what type of fertilizer should I use if any at all?

Here are some pictures of my death and destruction.  Any help would be appreciated.

1nv8a6h,https://www.reddit.com/r/SoundTried/comments/1nv8a6h/assess_best_vacuum_sealer_vakumar_vh5186_is_it/,Assess best vacuum sealer Vakumar VH5186 is it worth the hype,"The Vakumar VH5186 seemed like an ordinary vacuum sealer on my first day unpacking it, but within weeks of testing, it quickly became one of those kitchen gadgets I can’t believe I lived without. It’s not flashy or gimmicky; it’s just really good at what it does. This vacuum sealing machine does more than the basics: it handles moist, dry, and even liquid-rich foods without making a mess of your hands, countertop, or patience. Admittedly, I was skeptical about its bold claim of sealing liquids effectively (soups, anyone?), but the unique liquid sealing mode proved to be a standout feature. I couldn’t help but try it on everything from homemade chicken broth to last night’s leftover stew.

**Design and Usability**  
Right from the start, I was impressed by its compact design and the mix of stainless steel with durable ABS construction. It feels sturdy yet light enough to maneuver without a struggle, weighing just over eight pounds. If you’re like me, the countertop is always prime real estate in the kitchen, so its sleek 15.7” x 7.4” size fits beautifully without dominating the space. The built-in LED screen with a progress bar is arguably one of its nicest features for the tech-averse. No fumbling through confusing buttons; it’s visual and intuitive to use. The one-hand locking handle is also a game-changer—you can seal with one hand while the other hand is...let's be fair, probably holding coffee.

**Performance That Stands Out**  
Performance-wise, this machine is an absolute workhorse. It boasts a 90Kpa pressure, and apparently, it can handle over 200 seals consecutively in a short time. While I don’t plan on hosting a vacuum-sealing marathon to test that claim, I did try a back-to-back session with several bags containing raw veggies, fish fillets, and leftover casserole. It sealed each one consistently and with a satisfying absence of air pockets. By the way, double heat seals keep those particularly moist foods—like marinated steak tips—secure without any leakage. Moisture is usually the enemy of vacuum sealers, but not here!

[Check Vakumar VH5186 price on Amazon.](https://gogeary.com/p/b0bpkj68zk/)

**Flexibility in Food Modes**  
The versatility this vacuum sealer brings to the table surprised me, honestly. I loved the different mode options for dry, moist, and liquid sealing. You also get a pulse mode for delicate items (looking at you, fragile breadsticks!) where you can stop the vacuum mid-process. This feature alone saved an entire batch of homemade cookies I had prepped, as they stayed intact rather than getting smooshed! Switching the modes is easy, and the extra customization gives you more control than your average kitchen gadget.

**Highlights**  
- Unique liquid sealing mode seals soups, marinades, and more with ease.  
- One-hand operation simplifies the sealing process.  
- LED screen with progress bar offers user-friendly navigation.  
- Double heat seal prevents leaks for moist or liquid-heavy foods.  
- Compact and lightweight design doesn’t take up much space.  

**Shortcomings**  
While I really enjoy using this sealer, I did stumble upon a few areas of concern that are worth mentioning:  
- The noise level caught me off guard initially. It’s not outrageously loud, but if you’re vacuum-sealing in the middle of the night, it’s enough to wake light sleepers.  
- Bag storage and the built-in cutter, while convenient, felt a bit clunky during use. It wasn’t bad, but I hoped for a smoother transition between cutting bags and loading them into the unit.  
- The instructions were clear, but if you’re normally impatient with manuals, the setup can take a moment longer than expected for someone new to vacuum sealing.

**Competitive Options**  
Comparing this product to its peers, brands like FoodSaver and NutriChef often come to mind. FoodSaver units tend to emphasize ease of use, often with fewer manual options but similar consistent sealing performance. Meanwhile, NutriChef brings sleek designs and extra affordability, although leaks with moist foods can be more common in their models. The Vakumar VH5186 outperforms both in liquid sealing capability by far and offers more food mode variations than competitors at this price point. However, it doesn’t match FoodSaver’s well-oiled bag cutting mechanisms or NutriChef’s quieter operation.  

**True Value**  
Although this vacuum sealer isn’t the cheapest out there, it delivers exceptional cost-effectiveness, especially for households that meal prep, freeze seasonal produce, or store bulk meat. Having tested the machine across a variety of foods, I can confidently say that its efficiency pays off by cutting down food waste. You’ll spend less replacing stale crackers or freezer-burnt chicken breasts. Comparable models might save a few bucks, but none provide as robust a suite of features to keep meals fresher longer.

Normally I stock up, but I didn’t have an order ready yet.

I went to a Dutch chain store called Simon Levelt (not really specialty coffee, more like coffee machines, burned coffee etc.). On their website they showed the Kalita Wave 185 filters in the blue packaging, which I’ve used before. I asked the salesperson, she said they had them, and then brought out a pack with green text instead of blue.

I’d already seen discussions about “green vs blue” packaging, but never found a clear answer. The salesperson insisted “they’re the same” and wasn’t very helpful. I figured maybe it was just a certification thing or an EU packaging variation, so I bought them anyway.

When I opened them at home, though they smelled really bad right out of the bag. Nothing like the usual Kalita filters. They’re also a different color, kind of in-between bleached and unbleached. I absolutely hate unbleached filters and these smelled too bad to even try. I’m definitely not wasting expensive coffee on them.

Really disappointing. I won’t be going back to that store, and for anyone else wondering: if you see the “green text” KWF-185 filters, be careful they are not the same as the usual blue ones.

1nv894x,https://v.redd.it/6251tg4p5isf1,Baby squirrel (5 wks?) Hypoglycemia!,"Yesterday a tiny squirrel ran up to me when I walked out onto my porch with my morning coffee. It ran up my leg and so I picked it up. It seemed very small and frightened. I searched the area for a Nest to see if I could give it back to his mother. I was unable to find anything. There are local dogs and cats and other squirrels and I was afraid to leave it out without any protection. I ordered squirrel formula, but it was not set to arrive until the afternoon. I have no idea how long the baby had been out. I am posting this in hopes that it may help someone else in the future.

By about 1 PM the squirrel was very lethargic. It looks semiconscious and it began arching it back and flopping around. I thought perhaps it was a seizure. Its eyes were slanted, half lidded. And it would throw it arms and legs out straight and its tail would flop around, its mouth would be open “guppying”. It would happen for a maybe 20 seconds, and then the squirrel would go limp. It was very unresponsive. Even when I tried to give it plain water on my fingertip, it would not respond.

As the next hour passed by, I began to feel certain that the squirrel was going to die. I was so sad and debated whether I just let it die peacefully or keep searching for an answer. Eventually, I came across an intake form for a squirrel rehab facility in Florida. 

That intake form described similar symptoms and indicated this could be hypoglycemic shock. There was a suggestion in parentheses to give the squirrel honey if at all possible. I did not have honey on hand. The only thing I had was maple syrup, so I dipped a Q-tip in the maple syrup and shoved it in the squirrel‘s cheek. I did this a few times until the squirrel began to rouse. Once it began to appear more responsive, I gave the squirrel another good dose of maple syrup and it became fully awake. At that point, my squirrel formula had arrived, it would not respond to my attempts to feed a squirrel formula in the hour prior. Once it seemed alert enough, I gave it a bottle and it ate voraciously. After a few more hours, I fed it again and this morning I woke up and said it for a third time it appears to be doing just fine now! 

I wish that this information was more readily available. I did not find any information at all about signs of hypoglycemia. It looks like seizures to me and that was originally what I was looking for, but everything indicated nutritional deficiencies, and I did not believe that the squirrel was old enough to have been away from his mother long enough to had developed MBD!

I hope this information will help save another squirrel caretaker should they be looking for these symptoms online! ",33,1759325410.0,squirrels,8,1.0,False
1nv892r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Interstitialcystitis/comments/1nv892r/please_help_me/,Please Help me,"Hello ! 

Sorry for my langage, i’m French. 

I am 27 years old. I had not had cystitis for about six years. 
I've had cystitis in the past, like everyone else, which I treated with antibiotics (fosfomycin – a single-dose antibiotic – I'm French), which provided relief after a few hours, and 48 hours later I was fine. I had a perfectly normal life and bladder. 

On 20 July, I had a severe cystitis that was very painful, which I treated with the usual antibiotic. I was confident. It had always worked until now. The next day I felt better but still had symptoms, and on 26 July I ended up with another severe cystitis. I had an antibiogram done, which showed E. coli sensitive to many antibiotics, including the one I had already taken. So I took the same one again, and I was fine until 12 August. 
At that point, I started experiencing severe burning again. I did a urine test strip, which showed leukocytes in my urine, and I was in pain, so I took the antibiotic again, which relieved the pain. 
On 18 August, I was again in a lot of discomfort, so I had another antibiogram done, which showed leukocytes but no bacteria. I took the antibiotic anyway because I thought it was the beginning of an infection... 

I continued to experience discomfort and pain until 27 August, when I went to A&E because the pain had become much worse and I had a burning sensation.
New antibiogram: E. coli (it seemed to be the same as the one a month earlier, it was also resistant to amoxicillin - like the first urine test) it was sensitive to many antibiotics. I was put on a 7-day course of treatment.
At that point, I was hopeful. 

During the seven days, I felt better but was still uncomfortable and had persistent symptoms. Three days after finishing the course, I had burning sensations and severe pain again for two to three hours. I took another antibiotic for 10 days this time, Bactrim. The antibiogram showed that the bacteria were also sensitive to this medication. During the treatment, the symptoms persisted but were ""attenuated"", if I can put it that way, as with the other antibiotic. 

It has now been almost 15 days since I finished the course. 
Since then, I have had an ultrasound scan of my kidneys and bladder, which is normal. 
Last week, I had urine tests done, which were also normal. 

I went to see a urologist because I don't understand why I'm still in so much pain when there is no longer an infection and I've never been bothered by this to such an extent in my life. 

The urologist told me that after a severe case of cystitis that lasted more than a month, like mine, it was normal for the bladder to remain inflamed, and that it could potentially last for three months (he was vague about the duration). He told me that sometimes the bladder remains inflamed for a very long time afterwards. 

When I asked about interstitial cystitis after researching it online, he told me that I had an identified cause for my current cystitis (which is still present even without bacteria) and that, in his opinion, it was too early to consider that. 

So I have been in pain/discomfort continuously for 1.5 months, with no noticeable improvement. 
In terms of treatment, I have tried anti-inflammatories, antispasmodic bladder treatment, painkillers... nothing seems to work. 
I take cranberry (at an effective dose) + D-Mannose daily.
These are my symptoms: 

- A kind of cramp, similar to menstrual cramps but less severe, but which never stops. A dull, diffuse pain that doesn't hurt when I press on my bladder. 
- More acute pain when I urinate and in my bladder in general (I almost always feel it when I press on my bladder, even gently). 
- A kind of ""spasm"" in the urethra, which often occurs after urinating, when I put my trousers back on, but it can also happen for no reason. 

It never stops. Strangely, the cramp and the sharp pain do not occur at the same time. 

This is my big problem at the moment, it's ruining my life. I'm desperate.
This morning I had to leave work because I had severe burning and thought I was having a relapse, but in the end I don't think that's what it is. I had a urine culture done... I'm waiting for the results. 

For your information, I recently had all the tests for sexually transmitted diseases + yeast infection and vaginal flora, and everything is normal. 
Otherwise, I'm fine, no particular problems. 
The cause of the first cystitis was sexual intercourse. 

Has anyone had a similar experience to mine? Any advice? Anything positive to say? 
I'll take anything.

I haven't noticed any particular reactions after eating or drinking certain things. As a precaution, I've stopped drinking coffee. 

I support you. Thank you for reading, we are always alone with our pain... I know it's ""only"" been a little over two months since it started, but I'm really depressed. And I'm afraid it will never go away. 

Thank you for reading.

Overall this year I've managed to get 50 different solo games to the table with a total of 302 plays.  Last year my solo plays was basically Spirit Island over and over again, this year I wanted to dive deeper into the hobby and get a lot of different games to the table.  I know there's a lot I'm missing out on, what are your top hits for the year?  A few highlights for me:

A lot of my plays occur while traveling for business, so you'll see a lot of smaller footprint games in my top 25.  I do enjoy solo challenges or a campaign type structure, so I've enjoyed things like The Lone Gun from Fliptown or The Noisy Year in For Northwood!  Several of the tile laying games like Cascadia and Dorfromantik also do a great job of changing up your targets which I think keep the game feeling fresh.

I've got a lot of Garphill Games on my list, and it's hard to pick a favorite.  I was able to complete the solo challenges in Hadrian's Wall earlier this year and currently working through The Anarchy.  Skara Brae though has been my surprise hit this year - never thought managing midden would be so much fun!

Got my first couple of campaign games to the table with Eila and Something Shiny and Sleeping Gods: Distant Skies.  There's a lot more replayability with Sleeping Gods but I enjoyed the varying chapter setup and endings of Eila.  I really liked Kingdom Legacy as well, just wish it was replayable (I destroyed my deck as instructed when I played).

On the heavier front, I've got a number of games I enjoy but typically only fit in my weekend schedule.  Spirit Island remains my favorite, but finally got Mage Knight to the table (definitely understand the draw there!) and I also enjoy Ark Nova, Dune Imperium Uprising, Ezra and Nehemiah, and The Elder Scrolls Betrayal of the Second Era.  I'd love to get all of them to the table more, but none of those play easily on a hotel room desk and there's only so many hours in the day!

Let's see what you all have been playing as well, and let me know if you have any questions on any of my favorites this year!

Can ANYONE else relate to me?  I have the amazing opportunity to drive my stepson to school Tuesday through Friday every other week 🙄 we have him every other week Monday night thru Sunday night. 

My 10 year old SS is pretty obsessed with food in general, it is all he talks about. Even his dad noticed. His eating habits has caused him to gain a concerning amount of weight in one year, the year where his mom took him away from his dad and moved 3 states away for the time being. 

Every day he is asking me to take him to Dunkin Donuts or Burger King for breakfast. In the summer when I had him and my niece and nephew every week day, we would go but definitely not every day. It is difficult for me to say no to any kid because it makes me feel like a mean person but his school is half an hour away with traffic and I absolutely refuse to bring him before school now. His dad told him to eat breakfast at home, but he doesnt like any of the options (and we have a lot- fruit, yogurt, cereal, eggs, granola, sausages etc) 🙄 Nope. He wants his bacon egg and cheese on a croissant, hashbrowns, and chocolate milk. We found out that he would purposely waste his food because if he is hungry, he figured we would make sure he isn't hungry by bringing him to Dunks. No.

Today was the worst of it all. He refused to eat breakfast. Came into my room. Asked me"" why did dad take your credit card"" (i told him he did but he didnt). Kept saying ""i really just want a bacon egg and cheese, I wont eat school breakfast, I wont eat here, I honestly forgot to eat my cereal, I honestly just wasnt hungry for it""

This kid kept going back and forth with me trying to pull the ""but why, why, why"" ""im gonna be starving"" ""if dad can get coffee every day, why cant I get a bacon egg and cheese?""

I have to keep telling him its not normal to eat fast food before school everyday. I would literally eat a grapefruit and frosted mini wheats in vanilla soy milk every day before school while reading the back of the friggen box as a kid 🙄 Dunks was more of a weekend thing and I told my SS that. 

In the car on the way to school, he talked about food the WHOLE CAR RIDE. Id try to change the subject but once again we would land on fast food, with him saying ""don't know why my dad would do this to me"" ""im honestly gonna be starving, i just want a bacon egg and cheese so bad"". Like guys it would NOT stop. Followed by ""can you see if my dad can pick me up some fried chicken today"" 

It is giving me cringe vibes and im not sure how to handle this. His dad is the one telling me not to bring him,  I feel like a mean person for not bringing him tho 🙄 Yesterday he would barely speak to me because I didnt bring him. 

Can anyone else relate? Is anyone else's step kid pulling the same shit? Is there anything more we can do or say to stop this foolishness lol",2,1759325282.0,stepparents,12,1.0,False

I was in a rough place, mentally, and when I get like that my diet and overall health gets quite bad. So, everytime I came home from my late class, I would stop by the shop and buy myself a tub of Ben and Jerry's icecream - if they weren't on offer, i'd just buy a different brand because, let's be honest, they are EXPENSIVE.

I would then get home and eat all of it. Bare in mind, everyone's done that in some point in their lives and it's fine. But i was doing this once a week, sometimes even twice a week.

As my classes changed and I got in a better mood, my destruction of tubs of icecream stopped. Recently though, I gave in, and got myself some. I've been in a shitty place recently and couldn't help myself.


Ice cream will be the death of me. Specifically the Netflix and Chill flavour, or anything chocolate or coffee flavoured.

I’ve thought about doing that thing where you wake up thirty minutes earlier than you need to, take an energy supplement, and then go back to bed, so by the time you wake up for good, you’re feeling energized.

I would just like to feel less miserable first thing in the morning lol. 

Are there any supplements you recommend? For context, I’m very sensitive to caffeine and get the jitters from one cup of coffee, so I shouldn’t need something that’s super strong and equivalent to three shots of espresso.

Always an adventure, filled with wonder and merriment. Also weirdness and a deep desire to try and game the system.

Forgive me gentle readers, it's been a while and there just hasn't been anything Tale-worthy. Don't get me wrong, I'm not complaining. We like quiet and boring in this industry. But we still expect a certain amount of shenanigans. Even the move-in week for the local university was utterly uneventful.

Buttercup the Emotional Support Unicorn is in her usual spot by the coffee station. There are some lovely fall colors in the ribbons, should anyone want to braid her mane.

Tonight's Tale begins with a phone call. The caller is a young woman with a tone of voice I can only describe as ""spoiled brat"". No really, this was someone used to getting whatever she wants. Yay. It's two in the morning, do we have any rooms left? We do, and prices are quoted. 

Then the wheedling and whining begins. 

Why are the prices so high? Is there a discount? What if they only need it for a few hours? (Oh, you're used to *that* sort of hotel experience, are you?) What do you mean when you say I need a credit card? I can't pay cash? Will my ApplePay work? What do you mean when you say the full amount of the stay will be put on the card? Can I put half on the card and pay the rest in cash? And on and on and on and on...

She finally says ""Let me call some other hotels first"" and hangs up. I am relieved. Let her be someone else's problem. As much as I'd like to sell the room, sometimes it's just not worth it.

An hour later, she comes in. Damn.

If her voice was bratty, her entire outfit screams it, and her attitude is extremely pushy and demanding. Not in a shrieking Karen sort of way, but in a ""diva"" way, if that makes sense? Very high-maintainence, that one.

She's also somewhat intoxicated. Not sure what chemicals are involved, but she's definitely only got one foot on planet Earth. She's chattering away incessantly and clicking her three-inch glitter acrylic nails on the counter as punctuation. Ugh.

She's still angling for a huge discount, fluttering her lashes and leaning over a *bit* more than strictly necessary. Telling me she's  a bartender here in town, stays in town *allll* the time. All this to cover that she's *extremely* reluctant to give a credit card, even to the point of offering me double the rate in cash. Classy.

Your humble narrator is unmoved. He knows *damn* well that the sort of people who try to get you to violate policies are the reason the policies exist. She *really* doesn't want to give a credit card. Experience tells me that this is either because they plan to trash the room or because they don't want to tip off their parole officer. Possibly both. 

After explaining to her *for the fifth time* that I would need a card, an actual card, not her phone, she screams ""FUCK!!"" and flounces out. Oh good. Another day saved by sticking to the hotel policies.

Fifteen minutes later she's back again. *Argh*.

Okay, fine, get her into a room. ID? Ah. Yeah, she's a local. Ten minutes away in a town that is pretty much where all the county's riff raff have accumulated, and which has a lot of much cheaper hotels. The card? A prepaid debit card of the green variety. Lovely. To my deep surprise, it actually authorizes. The keys are given, and she leaves my lobby.

Did she then sneak someone in through the side door? Of *course* she did. Sigh. Still, I can tell why she's the one getting the room. The guy has a sizable number of what look like prison tattoos.

Still, they're *finally* in bed and I don't have to... Oh, they want a different room because the RV doesn't work. *Sigh*...

In any case, take a moment say goodnight to Buttercup, and have a wonderful day.

# $500 - $5000 Automatically updated [PCPartPicker.com](http://PCPartPicker.com) lists!

Hi[ ](https://i.imgur.com/gDwhIXm.png)everyone, it's time for the Autumn version of the PC Best Buy Guide! Just to let you know: I'm expecting my first child in the next few weeks, so replies might be a bit slow the coming time!

If this is your first time here, here's how this guide works:

* Select a list that fits your budget, and this will take your to PCPartpicker.com.
* Instead of having manually selected parts, the site will always select the cheapest option that satisfies the parametric selection or filter, while also maintaining intercompatibility between all parts.
   * For example, if the list has a parametric filter for RAM that says ""2x16GB, 5600-6000 MT/s, 6-10ns"", it will choose the cheapest set of RAM that fits this description, considering current availability, country, currency, etcetera.
* These lists are likely not 'perfect'. For example, there might be good deal on a certain product, but it might still be $1 more expensive than the cheapest option, thus it still won't show up in the list. You're always free to ask in the comments or a separate thread if a list can be optimized for your specific needs.

# Changed trends:

* With older CPUs like the Ryzen 5600 going up in price, makes it hard to recommend a DDR4 based system currently. DDR5 continues to drop in price, while the slowest DDR5 is faster than the fastest DDR4 RAM. The Ryzen 5500 is currently the only super-budget CPU I would recommend at just $70. Beyond that, up until the Ryzen 5 7600, the i5 12400(F) at $110 is the only CPU for a gaming PC that makes sense.

|[$750](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/Photonman1/saved/#view=xnWDkL)|Some significant upgrades here. A faster CPU, 3rd party cooler, 32GB DDR5 RAM, stronger power supply, and a 1TB SSD. |Nvidia RTX 5060; i5 14600K(F) if you can get it under $150; a case you like.|Drop the 3rd party cooler (and use the included stock cooler),  swap the GPU with the Intel B580.|
|[$850](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/Photonman1/saved/#view=DD6snQ)|There are 2 options here: going for a Ryzen 7600 or upgrading the GPU to the 16GB variant.

|[$1000](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/Photonman1/saved/#view=YVsZzy)|Upgraded to the 16GB RTX 5060 ti for better performance and better feature support.

|[$1600](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/Photonman1/saved/#view=Nk4qBm)|Upgraded the CPU to the 7800X3D as long as the price is decent. We also needed to improve cooling performance with a better cooler. Motherboard chipset is upgraded. |Upgrade directly to the Ryzen 7 9800X3D. Upgrade to liquid cooling. Higher end case. Higher end motherboard.|Drop back to a 1TB SSD.|
|[$1800](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/Photonman1/saved/#view=G3V6qs)|Upgraded to the 9800X3D. Better quality SSD. Bigger case. |Additional storage. Liquid cooling. Higher end case.||
|[$2000](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/Photonman1/saved/#view=v87WBm)|Here we're flushing out the build. The RTX 5080 is in a very tough spot as it's just around 10-15% faster than the 5070 ti, while costing $250 more.  We get a high end motherboard, 4TB of SSDs, a high end case & power supply. |Upgrade to the RTX 5080; you can also drop some of the storage for this upgrade, even though it's not great value. |Drop any of the multiple upgrades mentioned. |
|[$2500](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/Photonman1/saved/#view=29hyqs)|If you do really want to spend more, you can max out your parts without overspending way too much. The RTX 5080 is your only option here, as the RTX 5090 is still way outside of reach. We're upgrading to liquid cooling, more storage, a higher end case with WiFi 7, and a platinum rated high end power supply. |You can pick any high end case you like. ||
|[$4000](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/Photonman1/saved/#view=nQ8YQ7)|If you really want an RTX 5090, you'll have to pay up. AMD has no competitor here, so Nvidia can set the price wherever they like. |Anything you like!|Air cooling, less storage, lower end motherboard.|
|[$4000 (Themed)](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/Photonman1/saved/#view=b8WDkL)|An example of a themed build you can do. The ASUS ProArt line looks great, and has good quality. Do be wary of customer support issues that ASUS is experiencing currently.|||

Even with just $750 we're getting a very strong 20-core CPU and 32GB RAM. |More storage, more RAM (2x24GB, 2x32GB), high end power supply. |Core Ultra 5 245K.|
|[$1150 3D Workstation](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/Photonman1/saved/#view=ntV6qs)|We upgrade the 2D workstation to a 3D one by adding a strong GPU like the RTX 5060 ti. This model with 16GB VRAM should give you a lot of room for many workstation tasks.|More storage, more RAM (2x24GB, 2x32GB), high end power supply. ||
|[$1500 3D Workstation](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/Photonman1/saved/#view=ygD2bv)|We basically upgrade everything aside from the CPU and GPU themselves. We drastically increase the quality of things like the cooler, case, power supply, storage (+capacity), and more. |Alternatively, you can drop some of these upgrades and change the CPU instead to the Core Ultra 9 285K. ||
|[$1750 3D Workstation](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/Photonman1/saved/#view=npZRgs)|Upgraded tot he Core Cultra 9 285K, and a higher end power supply. |||

1nv80dx,https://i.redd.it/66vw7vgw3isf1.jpeg,Consistency tips. Please feel free to add on.,"Full disclaimer, I'm nowhere near an expert on espresso or this machine for that matter. I dig this new hobby that the Luxe Cafe has sparked, and I want everybody to get the same results I enjoy.

That being said, I wanted to throw out some tips that helped me get consistent shots of espresso. Honestly, most of these ideas were picked up from scrolling around here. I'm just putting them in the same place. Please feel free to add whatever you've figured out, hopefully we can help some people out!

1) Eliminate the idea of using the quad basket for espresso. Save it for the regular coffee if that's your thing. To get anything close to what the yield should be you're grinding close to, if not at the coarseness of drip coffee. Nothing has yielded more disappointing pulls quite like that obscenely large bean casket. This has been one of the most helpful steps for me personally.

2) Grind 2 steps higher than the BA suggests. I don't really have a great explanation behind this. Someone suggested it, and it's hit right on every time since.

3) Run one (or two) warm up brews without any grounds through your portafiler/basket. It's good to get everything warmed up and flowing before you pull a shot.

4) Tamp down with the pressure it takes to depress the spring, then ease up. You don't need to do this more than once. After I take the funnel off I'll put the tamp back on, lightly twisting back and forth to flatten out the grounds

5) I've brought this up previously, but the Capfei bottomless portafilter is great. It's not necessary, but seeing a difference in the pull from before dialing in to where you want to be is very satisfying. It's also good feedback when you change up your coffee beans.

I hope this helps. Let me know what does, or doesn't work for you.",3,1759324808.0,NinjaLuxeCafe,0,1.0,False

Could I get fired?","About 18 months ago, I got a fully remote job as an operations specialist at a big tech company. The hiring process was intense - several stages, a technical skills test, and a panel interview where I had to present a plan to improve workflows. They made it seem like the job required a massive effort and honestly, it was a bit intimidating.

But here we are, I'm sitting at my desk at 11 AM, drinking my second cup of coffee, and looking at my calendar to find it empty for the rest of the day. This has become the new normal.

The first few weeks were a grind. I was building new processes, creating KPI trackers, and fixing the way the team did its weekly updates. My manager was very happy with me, and called me a 'savior' after I set up some simple automations that flagged pending approvals.

But after that strong start, everything... calmed down completely. Once the systems were in place, my daily tasks dwindled to a few emails, a couple of follow-up calls, and a very rare 'urgent' fire to put out.

A large part of my day now is just acting. I make sure to have a complex-looking Notion doc open every time I share my screen. I might write a few emails in about half an hour, then use Slack's schedule-send feature to send them out staggered throughout the afternoon so it looks like I'm busy.

In meetings, I honestly zone out completely and use an AI tool (Scribe) to get a summary and action items later. My director, who's in his late fifties, thinks I'm a 'tech wizard' because of this. A few weeks ago, my manager asked if I remembered a specific detail from a project three months ago. All I did was a keyword search in my knowledge base (Obsidian) and gave him the answer in seconds. He asked me if I had a 'photographic memory.' Dude, I can barely remember my own birthday.

I won't lie, sometimes I feel incredibly guilty. Am I scamming them?

So I started filling my time with other things. I learned to bake sourdough bread. I started a small garden. And this year I've read more books than in the last three years combined.

Every so often, I get panic attacks that I might get caught, especially with all the layoffs happening these days. But just last week, my manager told me in our 1-on-1 that I'm doing 'fantastic work' and that the whole team is running more smoothly than ever because of my work. So... what am I supposed to do?

1nv7why,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuiltToTest/comments/1nv7why/explore_best_espresso_machine_for_home_keenstar/,Explore Best Espresso Machine for Home KEENSTAR Review Worth It,"Keenstar JH-C5010E espresso machine recently became a new addition to my kitchen counter, and it’s been an absolutely fascinating experience diving into its features. Right from unboxing, the sleek silver design with stainless steel accents caught my eye; it’s stylish without trying too hard and doesn’t look out of place even in a modern, minimalist setup. Measuring 11.8 inches deep, 5.5 inches wide, and 12.6 inches high, it occupies a surprisingly small footprint compared to similar machines I’ve used before. That said, while size matters, usability is what truly counts—and this machine packs plenty under the sleek exterior.

**Cold Brew or Hot Coffee: A Game-Changing Choice**  
One of the features that immediately caught my attention during testing was its ability to brew both hot coffee and cold brew. Having the option to switch seamlessly between your classic hot latte or a refreshing cold brew on a sweltering afternoon is fantastic. The cold brew function, taking just 10 minutes, felt almost too good to be true—less of a hassle than leaving it overnight in the fridge. I ran beans from a locally roasted Ethiopian blend through it, and the cold brew managed to extract a smooth, slightly sweet taste that rivals café quality.

**20-Bar Pressure System Ensuring Excellent Brews**  
This machine doesn’t hold back on brewing performance. With a 20-bar professional pump combined with a 1350W motor, it delivers espresso with exceptionally rich aroma and robust flavor. What intrigued me most was its pre-soak technology: it wets the grounds slightly before extraction, helping achieve a balanced, creamy shot of espresso. Pairing this with the right grind size (medium-fine worked best) took my coffee to a whole new level.

[Check Keenstar JH-C5010E price on Amazon.](https://vendm.com/p/b0d8kfvgm7/)

**Milk Frothing Power for Your Inner Barista**  
For those who love frothed milk, this espresso machine comes with a steam wand that punches above its weight. The powerful wand helped me create microfoam that was lightweight and almost velvety, perfect for cappuccinos and lattes. My cousin tried her hand at foam art—and while the designs were rudimentary, the foam itself was stable and creamy. The machine heated the milk to an ideal temperature for flavor retention, which definitely elevated the overall coffee-drinking experience.

**Touchscreen Ease and Quick Start**  
The touchscreen interface is where convenience meets elegance. Brewing espresso, Americano, or cold brew is as simple as a tap, making it beginner-friendly but sophisticated enough for experienced coffee enthusiasts. On rushed mornings, the advanced fast-heating system proved invaluable. Within moments, I had my caffeine fix ready and waiting. I did notice, however, that the screen could feel a tad sensitive; it occasionally registered a brush of my hand as an input.

**Highlights**  
• Compact design, perfect for smaller kitchens  
• Dual functionality: cold brew and a wide array of hot coffee options  
• 20-bar pressure pump for café-standard shots of espresso  
• Fast-heating mechanism, ideal for busy mornings  

**Areas for Improvement**  
• Noisy milk frothing wand might disturb quieter households  
• The touchscreen sensitivity can lead to misinputs  
• Instruction manual leaves some details unaddressed, requiring a bit of trial and error  

**Competing Products in the Market**  
Comparing this coffee maker to other household espresso machines like the Breville Barista Express or the De’Longhi Dedica, the Keenstar JH-C5010E provides commendable features at a more accessible price range. Machines like Breville offer highly customizable brewing, but at a steep cost. The inclusion of the pre-soak and cold brew functionality on this device sets it apart in terms of versatility. However, when it comes to milk frothing capabilities, both the Breville and De’Longhi steam wands are quieter and feel more refined, which would appeal to those prioritizing noise control during operation.

**Smart Spending Option?**  
In terms of value for money, this espresso machine is undeniably worth considering. Its versatility allows households to experiment with various coffee drinks without splurging on multiple brewing devices. Small, thoughtful additions like the detachable 37oz water tank and removable drip tray simplify both usage and cleaning—qualities that rarely come bundled with machines in this price bracket. While it may not be perfect for hardcore espresso aficionados seeking barista-grade manual control, it more than suffices for everyday coffee lovers.

It’s great for cranking out detailed images from just a text description, and when you mix it with solid AI shorts generator options on the [**Doitong** platform](https://doitong.com/) (they’ve got a bunch of curated AI goodies), you can animate those into quick shorts. I’ve used this to make stuff that feels pro without spending hours editing—perfect for anyone chasing those viral moments.

So, a bit about **Seedream AI**: it’s this straightforward tool that lets you generate or tweak images super fast—no account or fees involved, and you can do as many as you want. Running on a hefty 12-billion-parameter setup, it gets your prompts and spits out visuals with features like swapping backgrounds, filling in or expanding parts of the image, applying different styles, or boosting details. You can go for photorealistic vibes or something more artistic like anime or fantasy—whatever fits your short’s vibe.

**Here’s how I approach putting together a short:**  
First off, nail down your idea and type in a solid prompt. Something like, *“A bustling coffee shop interior at morning light, realistic with steam rising from cups and people chatting.”* Throw in deets about colors, mood, or angles to make it pop.  
Then, hit generate—it’s quick, like seconds. And if it’s not quite right, use the editing tools. Inpainting lets you fix spots, outpainting adds more to the scene, and you can sharpen faces or tweak styles on the fly.

Once you’ve got a stack of images (maybe keyframes for your story), hop over to [**Doitong**](https://doitong.com/) and grab an AI shorts generator tool to bring them to life. Things like auto-animating frames or adding motion effects turn static pics into smooth 15–60 second clips. I’ve made fun ones like quick life hacks or mini-stories that rack up views because they look real and engaging.

# A few things I’ve learned along the way:

* Get specific with prompts to avoid generic junk—mention lighting or composition.
* Play around with variations—sometimes the third try is gold.
* And yeah, you can use the images for whatever: personal or even commercial, just peek at their terms.

# Quick answers to stuff I wondered about at first:

* **What’s the big deal with Seedream?** It’s got this smart multimodal tech that really nails what you’re describing—context and all.
* **How long does it take?** Barely any wait—optimized for speed with fancy embeddings and layers.
* **Any catches on usage?** Nope—totally free and unlimited, no sign-up hassle.
* **Do you need to be a tech whiz?** Not really—it’s dead simple, just describe what you want.

If you’re itching to create content, why not give **Seedream** a spin along with other top AI shorts generator picks on [**Doitong**](https://doitong.com/)? It’s all free to test out, so dive in, experiment with some prompts, and start building those shorts. Who knows—your next one might blow up.

They were getting ready to scale harder and needed a new CRO and eventually a CEO succession plan. He asked me to help since I’ve been around exec recruiting for a bit.

When we started looking at firms, a few things stood out:

Sector experience: If they haven’t placed leaders in your world (AI, SaaS, security, fintech), they’ll waste time.

Real process: The good ones do market mapping, backchannel calls, scorecards. The lazy ones just hit up whoever’s on LinkedIn.

Outcomes, not logos: Don’t care if they had Google on a slide deck. I want to hear “this CEO we placed scaled the company, this CFO raised the next round.”

Cost and timing: Search firms aren’t cheap. But the bigger cost is a hire that flames out after a year.

I have been seeing this guy for a month now (we’re both in our mid-twenties) & honestly he’s amazing. He’s kind, sweet, respectful, emotionally available, he makes me feel safe, he compliments me, he makes an effort to see me, he pays attention to me, & makes sure I get home safe. Basically he’s the kind of guy I always said I wanted & he treats me like gold.

The problem is that he has really bad breath. It’s not just a one time thing after coffee or food, it’s constant. I’ve tried offering gum & mints when we’re together which helps a tiny bit but not much. When he talks close to me or tries to kiss me, it’s so hard for me to enjoy it because the smell is strong & honestly it makes me pull away. I even find myself making excuses to sit further from him or hold my breath which makes me feel awful because I really do like him.

I can tell he’s falling for me & I don’t want to break his heart. He deserves someone who loves him back fully, but this one issue is such a big deal for me that I don’t know what to do. I don’t know how to bring it up without completely crushing him because he’s such a sweetheart. At the same time I know I can’t ignore it forever.

Has anyone ever been in this situation? How do you even tell someone their breath smells without hurting them? Is there a way to be kind about it? I want to give this relationship a chance but this is a really big hurdle for me. Please help me 😭 

TLDR: I’m dating a really sweet guy who treats me amazingly, but his constant bad breath makes it hard for me to enjoy being close to him. I don’t know how to bring it up without hurting him & I need advice.",0,1759323773.0,relationships,22,0.5,False
1nv7lu7,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpanishAIlines/comments/1nv7lu7/ways_to_make_a_request_in_spanish_at_different/,Ways to Make a Request in Spanish at Different Levels of Politeness,"Sometimes you don’t know the best way to ask someone for something. That’s why in this post I’ve put together the most common ways to make requests in Spanish, useful for different situations and with varying levels of politeness.

1 . ¿Puedes? / ¿Puede? — can you (are you able to…)? Direct / neutral among friends or equals. Literally asks about ability; use ¿Puedes…? with tú, ¿Puede…? with usted for polite/formal contexts. 

* ¿Puedes cerrar la ventana? → Can you close the window?
* ¿Puede ayudarme con esto? → Can you help me with this?

2 . ¿Podrías? / ¿Podría? — could you…? Politer and more courteous than puedes. Great default for acquaintances or strangers; podría is the formal usted form.

* ¿Podrías traerme un vaso de agua? → Could you bring me a glass of water?
* ¿Podría decirme la hora, por favor? → Could you tell me the time, please?

3 . ¿Te importaría…? / ¿Le importaría…? — would you mind…? Softens the request; expresses that you don’t want to bother the person. Use te with tú and le with usted.

* ¿Te importaría cambiarte de asiento? → Would you mind changing seats?
* ¿Le importaría abrir la ventana? → Would you mind opening the window?

4 . ¿Serías tan amable de…? / ¿Sería tan amable de…? — would you be so kind as to…? Extra-polite, ideal for emails or formal spoken requests. Sería is the usted form.

* ¿Serías tan amable de revisar mi presentación antes de la reunión?→ Would you be so kind as to review my presentation before the meeting?
* ¿Sería tan amable de enviarme el contrato por correo electrónico?→ Would you be so kind as to send me the contract by email?

5 . ¿Me haces el favor de…? / ¿Me haría el favor de…? — would you do me the favor of…? Very courteous; common in service/formal contexts. Me haría… is the polite usted variant.

* ¿Me haces el favor de llenar este formulario? → Would you do me the favor of filling out this form?
* ¿Me haría el favor de firmar este documento? → Would you do me the favor of signing this document?

**Bonus:**

Ways to order food / buy something in Spanish

1 . ¿Me pones…? (Spain, cafés/bars)

* ¿Me pones un café con leche, por favor? → Can I have a coffee with milk?
* ¿Me da un café con leche, por favor? → Can I have a coffee with milk, please? (LA)

2 . ¿Me das…? (Universal)

* ¿Me das una bolsa, porfa? → Can I have a bag?
* ¿Me das dos barras de pan? → Can I have two baguettes?

3 . Quisiera… (Universal, polite)

* Quisiera una mesa para dos. → I’d like a table for two.

4 . Quiero… (Universal, direct)

* Quiero un bocadillo de jamón. → I want a ham sandwich.

1nv7lrs,https://www.reddit.com/r/GINWORLDART/comments/1nv7lrs/beauty_from_within_why_are_consumers_obsessed/,Beauty from Within: Why Are Consumers Obsessed with Ingestible Beauty?,"# Beyond Creams and Serums

Skincare has long been about creams, serums, and lotions. But the global beauty market is shifting toward a new frontier: **“Beauty from Within”**, also known as **ingestible beauty**.

Here’s a surprising fact: surveys show that **over 60% of women in Europe and the U.S. already use supplements such as collagen, biotin, and vitamins for skin, hair, and nail health.** Beauty is no longer just about what you put on your skin—it’s also about what you put into your body.

# A Rapidly Growing Global Market

According to IMARC Research, the global ingestible beauty market surpassed **$8 billion in 2024** and is projected to grow at a **10% CAGR through 2030**.

* **Japan and France**: Collagen drinks are so mainstream they’re sold in convenience stores.
* **South Korea**: Collagen jellies and fruit-based stick supplements have become bestsellers online, especially among women in their 20s and 30s.

# Why Is Ingestible Beauty So Popular?

1. **From the Inside Out** Nutrition directly influences skin health. Consumers now believe true beauty care must start internally.
2. **Convenience** No more complicated 7-step skincare routines. A capsule, jelly, or powder drink can be taken anywhere.
3. **Scientific Backing**
   * A German clinical study found that **8 weeks of collagen peptide intake improved skin elasticity by 15%.**
   * Japanese researchers reported that **oral hyaluronic acid increased skin hydration and reduced wrinkle depth.**

# Key Ingestible Beauty Ingredients

|Ingredient|Main Benefits|Notable Features|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Collagen**|Skin elasticity, wrinkle reduction|Absorbed better in peptide form|
|**Hyaluronic Acid**|Hydration, moisture retention|Enhances skin’s water-holding capacity|
|**Biotin**|Hair & nail strength|Known as the “beauty vitamin”|
|**Vitamin C**|Antioxidant, brightening, collagen synthesis|Essential for skin glow|

# Changing Consumer Behavior

* In the U.S., **65% of Gen Z women say they trust supplements more than topical skincare** for long-term results.
* In South Korea, collagen jellies are often consumed **like snacks**, showing that beauty is becoming both health-focused and enjoyable.

# Celebrities Are Leading the Trend

* Hollywood actress **Jennifer Aniston** famously stirs **collagen powder into her morning coffee** every day.
* K-pop idols often mention protein or collagen jellies as part of their pre-performance routine, sparking “**follow the idol routine**” trends among fans.

# Product Evolution: Making Beauty Fun

The ingestible beauty category is diversifying fast:

* **Collagen drops (liquid ampoules)**: add them to water or smoothies.
* **Beauty jellies & sticks**: portable and perfect for busy lifestyles.
* **Beauty cafés**: in Japan and Hong Kong, cafés now offer “add-on collagen powder” options for drinks.

Beauty is no longer a chore—it’s becoming part of everyday lifestyle and even leisure.

# Things to Keep in Mind

* **Consistency is key**: most studies suggest at least 8–12 weeks of continuous use for visible results.
* **Check ingredients and dosage**: collagen source (marine, porcine, bovine) and vitamin amounts vary widely.
* **Lifestyle balance matters**: supplements are helpful, but sleep, diet, and exercise remain essential pillars of beauty and health.

# Conclusion: Beauty Inside and Out

Ingestible beauty is not just a passing fad. Backed by science, embraced by celebrities, and demanded by consumers, it has become a **global wellness and beauty movement**.

The future of beauty routines is clear:  
👉 **From outside to inside, and from inside to outside.**  
True beauty today is about taking care of both.",1,1759323766.0,GINWORLDART,0,1.0,False

1nv7iw5,https://www.reddit.com/r/ALTAVAai/comments/1nv7iw5/3d_design_tools_were_too_expensive_and/,3D design tools were too expensive and complicated for us. So we built an alternative anyone can use.,"Hi everyone,

I wanted to share something we’ve been working on, and more importantly, the reason why.

For years, we tried using professional 3D tools like Blender, Maya, and 3ds Max. They’re incredibly powerful, but let’s be honest: the learning curve is brutal. You need endless YouTube tutorials, online courses, and weeks (sometimes months) of practice before you can even create a simple outfit. On top of that, subscriptions often cost $30–$100+ per month. For many beginners, students, or hobbyists, it’s just not realistic.

[\[Blender: https:\/\/www.blender.org\/\]](https://preview.redd.it/ru0s52kmzhsf1.png?width=1090&format=png&auto=webp&s=a44acf28157043addcad427926cc759da9093cba)

[\[Maya:https:\/\/www.autodesk.com\/products\/maya\/overview\]](https://preview.redd.it/iaofculnzhsf1.png?width=3350&format=png&auto=webp&s=33e585553bf4d3d049f3f6a702dd46452e211b21)

That frustration got us thinking: **what if 3D fashion creation could be as easy as drag and drop, and cost less than a cup of coffee?**

That’s how [Altava.ai](http://Altava.ai) started.

* **Affordable**: Plans start at $4.99/month, with a free trial to explore before upgrading.
* **Accessible**: No prior experience required. The interface is simple, intuitive, and template-driven.
* **Relevant**: Works directly with platforms like Roblox, Zepeto, VRChat, and Snapchat, so your designs can live where communities already thrive.

https://preview.redd.it/asnhvihrzhsf1.png?width=2490&format=png&auto=webp&s=2c0c5b3c4453793e0786ed24b80b7de4b5f19e93

We’re not claiming to replace Blender or Maya. Those tools are unmatched for professional 3D work. But we wanted to create a **friendly entry point** for people who just want to design, play, and express themselves in the digital world.

We’ve already seen how powerful user-generated content can be in virtual economies. Creators are not just making fun outfits; they’re selling them, building communities, and even earning real income. We want to make sure more people can join that opportunity, without the steep barriers of cost and complexity.

[\[VRChat: https:\/\/hello.vrchat.com\/\]](https://preview.redd.it/zfe4ip040isf1.png?width=1384&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b0c6776d56a0ea0d5b7b0c47a59869eb927e40c)

👉 I’d really love to hear from this community:

* If you’ve tried creating 3D outfits, what was the hardest part for you?
* Would you consider trying a lightweight, beginner-friendly tool like this?
* Which platforms (Roblox, VRChat, Zepeto, Snapchat…) would you design for first?

So I unfortunately use those single use little packages of coffee for convenience. I struggle with my mental health so I don't have a lot of energy each day. I'm not ready to make coffee from ""scratch"" every day but I'm definitely ready to prepare something 1/2/3 times per week to have it last not just for a day

It wouldn't really be a problem BUT I have tried buying instant coffee in bulk and I personally hate the taste of it (I avoid obvious harmful brands which in turn does not leave me with many options in my country) My taste buds are awful and everything tastes more bitter, I like my coffee milky and sweet. I tried using homemade caramel syrup but it still felt like it was missing something. I'm determined to stop buying those packets and I'd appreciate any recipes/advice on how can I drink coffee without generating huge waste and with it tasting good by my standards

1nv7f1n,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nv7f1n,I just finished Fatal Frame/Project Zero/Zero 5 Maiden of Black Water after keeping it in the back burner and now it's my favorite in the series. This story has touched me. SPOILERS AHEAD.,"My introduction to this series was FF1 when I was 9 back in 2001. I have played FF1, 2, 3, and 4 and have kept 5 in the back burner for a long time. I'm glad I just now played MOBW. Now it's my favorite in the series. The story particularly grabbed me. It deals with loneliness and suicide, things I have struggled with in the past, so the plot hits a little too close to home. My second favorite is FF3 The Tormented, which deals with bereavement and depression, and my depression in the past was what led me to have suicidal tendencies. So, yeah, Rei and Yuri's ""adventures"" hit too close to home. 

The whole concept of the mountain, the water, the maidens ""looking"" people to carry their burdens so they can die in peace, the boxes and the pillars, the black water, the ghost marriages and everything that Ose went through, are phenomenal. It's so well done and thought of. So compelling. The most powerful moment for me was when Yuri saved Hisoka at the end of Drop 12. Saving her from suicide, just like Hisoka did for Yuri before. And when they go back home they have a cup of tea and notice the warmth of the coffee, which Yuri didn't noticed before, evoking the idea that's in the little moments that life is worth living. I got goosebumps at that scene. It's so powerful. The other powerful moment was, of course, Yuri's good ending. Yuri, who was unable to cry, even at the point of suicide, couldn't shed a tear; cried when she ""looked"" and hugged Ose, taking her load, and her pain just like Ose had done for most people that came to die in the mountain. Someone finally ""looked"" her. Yuri feeling all her pain cried. It was that compassion that release the curse and finally Ose was able to move on. The black water is sucked away by the spring and the water became clear and pure. Hisoka is there waiting and Yuri cries and smiles at seeing her because she realizes she's not alone. 😭 This is so powerful. 🤧 I love this ending. The good ending of Yuri is the best ending this series has ever had, and I'm glad it's supposed to be the canon one. 

Miu, on the other hand... so sad. I know that people hate this part of the plot involving Miku and what she did. But I do think it's good writing. It shows the ugly reality that some people just don't overcome trauma and go through extremes because of it. I've seen in real life in others and even myself in some instances of my past. Also, ghost marriage is a belief held in both China and Japan, and I don't know where else, in cultures where the greatest shame for a woman is not getting married. I can imagine women in those cultures who grow old and never had the chance to get married to go to through this kind of ceremony before they die to console them. This wouldn't fly in the West, but it would in some Asian cultures. Also, Miku experience a lot of loss. Her only family left was her brother. Mafuyu was the only one that took care of her, gave her affection and was the only role model she had. So of course she would fall in love with the one that gave her a sembalnce of love and affection. Then in FF1 she loses him. And then in FF3 she reexperiences that loss. FF3 never stated or implied that Miku moved on. If anything I assumed that Miku did not get over her trauma. She was the first one (out of Rei, Kei/Mio) to succumb to the curse of the tattoo, she left Rei behind (just like she would do to Miu later) to run toward her brother and was comatosed for a while being with the ghost of her brother. On the other hand, Kei tried to break the curse and failed, then Rei broke and saved everyone's ass, including Miku. If it wasn't for Rei, Miku would have been another vengeful ghost in the Manor of Sleep. Rei saved her ass. Miku succumbed to her trauma. So, that leads to believe that she didn't really get over it in the end. I'm not excusing what Miku did. What she did was horrible, but it makes sense for her character. Taking all of this account, Miku's plot point in FF5 makes sense. So, it's good writing. I love Miu and relate so much to her. I used to be like her, dead inside and apathetic because everything seemed meaningless. No wonder. Out of the three protags in FF5, she's the one that had ot worse.

Ren plots points are really well tied together into the narrative. Being a reincarnation of Kunihiko Aso, the creator of Camera Obscura, who had Shiragiku as a childhood special friend, and as an adult had a thing with Ose, which was the last straw for her lose it and curse the mountain with the black water. His ""Paranormal Activity"" sections were a breath of fresh air. I loved them. Very creative and well done. 

I also love the aesthetics of the game in general. I dig it. The characters have amazing designs. Ren is sexy af (I'm a gay man, btw), Yuri, Miu, Hisoka and Rui are beautiful. The ghosts designs are sleek. They're beautiful but terrifying. And I know that people (I suppose straight men and lesbian women) say that this game is not scary because of the sexualization. I think that's a load of crap. If a hot guy, dead or alive, was in front of me with the intent of killing me, no matter how hot he is, I would be scared and would run for my life. I don't understand this argument. It seems so puritan and sexist. I don't think it's a healthy mentality. Parts of the end game are the scariest in the series to me, specially Miu's two chapter and Ren's last one. Ose chase sections are terrifying. A lot of people say the scariest part of the entire series are FF2's Sae chase sections. I don't think so. After experiencing Ose's, I'm like ""Sae who?"" No matter how far you run, Ose always teleports either besides you or right in front of you, which is the same mechanic that FF3's Reika had in the final fight. In 5 this mechanic is not in a final boss, it's on the regular chase sections!

The combat system is a blast. The controls are the smoothest in the series and having an adjustable rectangle for different angles is a great idea. I love the ""item find"" through camera angles and the shutter chance with the ghosts hitodamas. Blasting ghosts with Fatal Frames feels so satisfying in this game. Also, Hikami mountain and the locations within it are awesome. I like backtracking in games because I get to discover new facets of the same place and FF5 did that very well. I particularly liked the Ephemeral Shrine and the House of Binding the most.

I find Hisoka the most mesmerizing character. Her design, character, voice and personality are too good for her not be playable. She should have been playable. This is the only complaint about the game I have. I think the devs meant to make her playable in the Ayane chapters instead of Ayane. But included Ayane for marketing reasons. It makes so much more sense for Hisoka to do those chapters as the missing person was entrusted to her. It was her case. But Ayane comes out of nowhere and does it for her. What a shame. Both Hisoka and Rui deserved to be playable more Ayane. 

I'm also very proud of me because I was able to play MOBW in Japanese. I'm a Japanese learner for several years now, and I've been playing VNs and JRPGs with static text. Both FF2 and 5 are my first games in Japanese without the VN style of exposition. Prior to FF5, I played FF2, which I played before in English, and since the announcement of the remake I decided to replay it but this time in Japanese. I was able to finish it and do fine with it in its original language. But unlike FF2, I didn't playe FF5 in English. It was my first playthrough and I did it in Japanese. But I was able to do it. I understood 90ish% of character dialog. The hard part were the notes. And I had to look up a lot of words and record them in my vocabulary retention app. But I pulled through and I was able to understand the story and most of the nuances and had a blast with it. 

Out of all the games in the series, MOBW is the one that lends itself the best for a novel, movie, or TV series adaptions. It has the dense and well done lore and a very TV series like presentation of the story. 

The two ending songs, 鳥籠 (Tori Kago) In This Cage and 彼岸花 (Higanbana) are amazing. I knew of their existence prior to finishing the game, and I learned them and sang them around the house while cooking or cleaning while my boyfriend was laughing at me. 😅 I think it's unfortunate that Tori Kago was locked behind finishing the game with an specific outfit for Yuri regardless of ending. I think the melody and lyrics of Tori Kago fits Yuri's good ending and Higanbana fits the Yuri's bad ending. Regardless of this, we have these two amazing songs for casual listens.

My ranking of the series is as follows, from most favorite to less liked, FF5, 3, 1, 4 and 2. Yeah. My favorite is ""everybody's"" least favorite and my least favorite is ""everyone's"" favorite. Mio and Mayu's (and Yae and Sae's by extension) story did not grab me as much as the stories of the other four games. And that's okay, because everyone is unique and different and we don't have to be equal. I used to be a very negative person, and I used to say ""this is bad game and you shouldn't waste your time playing it"". Over the years I have become a better and more positive person and I noticed that I no longer say things like that. Now I say ""I don't like this game, so it's not for me, maybe you will like because it might be your thing"". That's the beauty of it. Taste isn't universal. What doesn't work for you, works for someone else. And for me, MOBW is my favorite in the series and is the one that has impacted amd touched me the most. For some of you it didn't do anything for you. And that's fine. We all have different experiences in life that shapes who we are. And that's beautiful. We get to be different. We get to be our very own selves. That's awesome. Thank you for reading.",13,1759323279.0,fatalframe,1,0.88,False

1nv7d6x,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1nv7d6x/break_up_left_me_devastated/,Break up left me devastated,"A little bit of her backstory, personality: Her mom can be very critical of her, when she was a child and even as an adult, and they always argue, so I'm not sure if she felt this way when she was at her parents house. She said that she doesn't want to become like her mother, I tried to understand her and explain like the traumatic stuff from our parents that we carry to our adulthood, and she was very reasonable and loved me for my wisdom, intellect. My girlfriend was very critical of other people, always finding faults, hated a lot of people, she says some specific people don't like her, so she doesn't like them even though there is no exact proof of that. She didn't have many female friends, or her relationship with females don't last long, she says she doesn't like drama and I believed her, she did have some male friends, friends she says she could never be with, even though one of those male friends, while drunk admitted that she was in love with my girlfriend, she said he's like that, he's eccentric, but that she would never be with him because he is filthy and doesn't see him like that. She has a sister with whom she is very close and I guess they talk about everything. My girlfriend even said to me after we started dating that she is the most nervous person in the world, even her sister said congrats to him that he can be with you, and they laughed at that like her nervousness isn't something to work on.  She also has often headaches, sinus aches, not sure if this can be contributed to her nervousness. She has an instagram profile with a lot of nature pictures and she is attractive and sometimes posts herself looking sexy, kind of like putting her ass in the front while on the knees, while she is in water or somewhere in nature where she is in her swimsuit. I said to her that I got cheated on in my previous relationship, she said she would never do such a thing, I told her that I get insecure when I see some posts like that and then she says that these are my insecurities and that she doesn't have anything to do with that. But she was also very kind to me when I needed, she was loving, showing affection, attention, did all these little things for me as I did for her. Wrote letters, buying books, flowers, little gifts, sweets, toys. We had such powerful and loving moments most of the time. So she wasn't exactly a bad person. 
A lot of people told me that she wasn't smart, she has a lot of self esteem even and talks much but sometimes stuff she says just aren't foundational, logical. She did talk bad about previous exes, stated reasons that weren't that bad, but she viewed them as bad, idk. She also said a lot of bad things about people I knew, she knew, mutual people we knew said that they didn't like me and so on. Her romantic relationships lasted between 1 and 2 years. And when she exits the relationship, she would be alone for 1, 2 year then enter a new one. And that in every relationship she needs to make a move on the boyfriend, as this was the case with us. She was a friend of my friend, and we were in a home where I was feeding 2 cats for a friend that went travelling, one night she sent a text to hang out just the two of us and then we hooked up. While we were together, she quit 2 jobs, and returned to the original one that she left in the first place, the same company I work for, she was sick often, sinus aches, headaches, tooth aches. She said how I needed to go to the gym even though I am fit and she loved my body, how I need to find a better job even though she ended back in the same company with much less money that I earn. many times she said how we will live together, how we are perfect for each other, how i am great, talked about wedding, having kids together, where we will live. i guess she was just waiting for me to be more manly, more expressive, fell in love with my potential. but in the end her nervousness won.
In a letter she sent me, she said, with me she can sometimes see the worlds from a different perspective, that she feels like she doesn't show me enough love and that it will change, that she will like I am, always be here for me.

Break Up

I was with this girl for 1 year and 2 months, I(M 27), she(F 29). Broke up this July, she was in a different city where her parents live, guarding the home, watering plants, etc. She asked me to come, I came and when I entered the home, she was on a couch, sitting in fetus position, just like a child, a weird face, anger, frustration. She did have this face earlier in our relationship, when she would feel overwhelmed(I try to hug her, hold her, ask what's wrong, what does she feel, did I maybe do something, or I just sit in silence, but nothing helps and it feels like she just gets frustrated with me, and maybe 2 out of 10 times she would apologize for being like that to me, I just say ""dont worry, it's ok""), I just sat next to her at her parents house, kissed her and hug her. Then I gave her a book from an author that she likes, I forgot to add something like a note on the beginning of the page, so she brought that up, then I wrote something about her. She kissed and then stood up while I was sitting and went to do something in the kitchen, make some meal or a juice. Not sure if something in that house triggered her, I was first time there. She would just do something around the house, chores. I asked if there's anything I can do, she said no. But when I lie down to read something or be on my phone, she would get a bit resentful that I'm laying there. Sometimes she would say you can do this and I do the thing she requests. Since she was a vegetarian, she would make meals for us, and I would clean the dishes. She was always making us food. Even though I wanted sometimes, she would just be like ""learn it on your own first"", even though I wanted to bake a bread at her place she wouldn't let me. I wanted her to catch a minute and lay beside me for just a moment so that we can feel each other and connect, but she just constantly is doing something around the house. And for every little mistake in my attitude, or action, or just a joke, she would get angry, but every good thing would pass unseen that usually made her happy. And it was like that for the next 2, 3 days. I was working on-call shift so I was awake until 5am every morning, and I was tired each morning since we go to the beach around 12pm, 1pm. So that's why I was on the bed most of the time in the mornings, watching something on my phone or reading, she got really mad at me the last day and she was in that emotion for the rest of the day. We went to the beach, and we just sat there in silence but could feel the tension between us, I could feel something wrong. She then started saying things like she feels like she always has to do something first. (Even when I try initiating on something, she wanted her way, sometimes she would think about my plan but in the last minute she would change her mind, sometimes we would then change plan, and sometimes when I want to stick to my plan she gets angry or something's bothering her). Then she says that I'm missing something in me, like fire/passion for life even though she was attracted especially that I don't talk too much, my wisdom, my eyes, my power for listening, intellect, soothe her soul, etc. When she started saying those things I just froze and knew where this was leading, so my brain just froze and couldn't think of anything and was just filled with emptiness, my trauma kicked in, of not being good enough, it's not safe to express my emotions, and I was suppressing a lot of things as a kid, and I became emotionally numb, so she spoke about the things that were hurting me throughout my whole life and I just became so insecure in that moment. While she was telling me all those things, ""you need to find something that you like and that will make you more likeable to yourself, go to church, speak with people there"". She was basically saying I have low self-esteem and that I was missing something in my life, that fire, that spontaneity, that passion, which I know for the past 15 years that I have an issue with that. So I just froze and while she said those things, I just said, ""yeah, I think it's brainrot that affected that"", it was the most stupid thing to say but my mind couldn't come with a better thing at that moment and then she said she needed time to work on herself and that she doesn't have energy to give me, I said ok if that's what she wants. I drove her home and she said that she loves me and to write her a message when I get home. 

Aftermath

In the next days we chatted a little, sent some photos but it was minimal contact. I then wrote to her the next week that I can longer this and that I respect myself enough to go no contact and then she bursted saying ""i can't believe that you are writing this now, that's how shallowly you see this relationship, and that now that I'm on standby I suddenly give a fuck"" and lot of anger and resentment was in her messages and then we argued, I tried to justify my feelings, she tried hers and it was going nowhere and we just stopped. 

(2 weeks after break up)In the next couple of days I asked her to talk, she didn't want to talk, said she already told everything and that she already decided. I then asked her to give her stuff back. When I did I asked her in person if she wanted to talk, she said her sister was at the house and that she is working right now. After that day I made a paragraph of all the thing in the relationship where I tried to understand her, how she treated me, my feelings, how she acted towards me, friends and all her bad personality traits and that spiraled into a fight, she said ""she is nervous and dynamic her entire life. That I wanted her to become lifeless and passive like I am(which I never said, I accepted all her flaws) That I feel like I was being used while she was sick, searching for job and now that she has a job she discarded me as everything is in place now, she said she will struggle again and that she will be on her own"". My birthday was in two weeks and she didn't contact to say anything. 
(2 months of NC)Then after a month I asked her to return my book, she said she would leave it in a market near my place, said there's no reason to do it in person, said it's easier for her, that was like a month of no contact, also after a couple of days I sent a message that if we see each other that we can greet(since we work at the same floor in the same company by some godly reason as we weren't before on the same floor, i was mostly from home but then some changes came), she said yeah, she doesn't see a reason that we don't say hi. 
(2 and a half months after breakup)Then later a month, today, I asked if she wanted to go out for coffee she said, that she wouldn't, said she is sorry and thanks for asking. It's 2 and a half months since our breakup.

My biggest tip is don’t just grab the first scale you see online or in a store at full price. Scales go on discount in cycles, prime day, black friday, seasonal sales,or even smaller site-wide promotions. If you’ve got some flexibility, waiting for these deals can save you a good chunk without sacrificing anything else.

Next, where you shop matters just as much as when. Amazon is usually a safe bet, there are many brands [like hoto](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0932CPSNR?maas=maas_adg_api_590790376575379363_static_9_129&ref_=aa_maas&tag=maas&aa_campaignid=lv_jNVb4hk48dTY4XLxlp&aa_adgroupid=lv_AM0ULltEfumE2KFqJd&aa_creativeid=lv_vg9sBTHddLRSgBSCGm&m=A2ZXT6R0FR7K6V) you can choose from, they have plenty of reviews and customer service is easy to work with if something goes sideways. Warehouse clubs or local kitchen stores sometimes have solid house-brand scales too, often at lower prices than the
coffee-specific models. Keep an eye out for open-box or floor model discounts in-store too, they’re still covered by warranty but come cheaper than brand-new units.

Now, knowing where to buy helps, but don’t cut corners on the essentials.Skimping on precision or max weight is a recipe for regret, you don’t want a scale that’s off by grams or can’t hold a full pour-over setup. What’s easy to skip? App connectivity, ultra-lightweight design, or fancy touchscreen interfaces. The only real essentials are accurate
measurements (0.1g is ideal), a readable display, and a max weight that fits your brewing or cooking needs.

Stick to these, shop at the right time, and you’ll hopefully land a solid, reliable scale that falls in your budget.",1,1759323122.0,u_Artistic-Pay7726,0,1.0,False

I moved this friday and have already noticed the tap water being a bit off, but fine to drink as is. When I boiled it however it started smelling funky and I actually threw away my morning brew because I couldn't drink it. It's sort of smells like algae, but I'm unsure(either way not nice).

This was yesterday, the first day where I've somewhat settled in and wasn't in exhausted moving mode. So this morning I've brewed the exact same tea the exact same way but with bottled water, and it's definitely better although it seems muted.

I also brew coffee where I suspect the taste will be affected as well, but I've not tried that outside of exhausted moving mode. The coffee I had then was alright, but something felt a bit off.

I've done some research about solutions and feel like bottled water is the worst solution although the simplest. I've looked into reverse osmosis and I've heard about Brita filters.

Hey everyone, here’s the summary from our latest descent into the underworld! We made some absolutely massive progress in *Hades II*, going on our deepest and most successful run to date. We started the night by crafting a devastatingly powerful Scorch/Blitz build, stacking boons from Hestia, Zeus, Artemis, and Hephaestus. This synergy allowed us to melt through the guardians of Erebus (Hecate) and Oceanus (Scylla & the Sirens), and for the first time, defeat the Infernal Beast of the Fields of Mourning. This victory pushed us into the final biome, Tartarus, where we got our first glimpse of Chronos's domain before ultimately falling. Along the way, we unlocked the Sister Blades, met a host of new characters (including the hilarious Narcissus), and dove headfirst into a philosophical rabbit hole with chat.

* **A God-Tier Run:** We successfully battled through all three main biomes, defeating Hecate, Scylla and the Sirens, and the Infernal Beast to finally reach the fourth biome, Tartarus.
* **The Perfect Scorch Build:** We focused our boons on creating a powerful damage-over-time build, combining Hestia’s Scorch effects with Zeus’s Blitz to shred enemy health bars and trivialize several encounters that previously gave us trouble.
* **A Philosophical Detour:** A fantastic question from chat sent us on a long and winding discussion about the nature of uniqueness and whether concepts like ""experience"" or ""everything"" can logically be considered ""a first.""
* **Meeting the Pantheon:** We expanded our network of allies and acquaintances significantly, receiving boons and quests from Hermes, Apollo, Hephaestus, and Artemis, and having memorable encounters with Odysseus, Arachne, and Narcissus.

### A Practical Takeaway

The core of our philosophical tangent revolved around the idea that every experience is, in a sense, a ""first."" We can turn this into a powerful practice. The next time you find yourself in a routine or familiar situation—making coffee, your morning commute, or even loading up a game—take a moment to treat it as a unique event. Try to notice one small detail you've never registered before. By framing each moment as the unrepeatable, singular ""first"" that it is, we can cut through the haze of routine and find a little more novelty and presence in the everyday.

### Chatter of the Day

**daniel_and**

While many chatters brought the laughs and commentary, Daniel gets the nod today for asking one simple, mind-bending question: ""do you think anything that exists can be a first even if it's unique?"" This single query sparked a nearly hour-long philosophical rabbit hole that became a core theme of the stream, perfectly blending deep thought with our descent into the underworld. Cheers for stumping us all in the best way possible!

### Highlights of the Day

* **The Cerberus Takedown:** After a few tough runs, this was the one where the build truly came online. Watching the Infernal Beast's health bar melt under a constant barrage of Scorch, Blitz, and seeking arrows was incredibly satisfying. We went from being intimidated by the guardian to confidently putting it down, marking a major step forward in our journey.
* **Chronos's Time Warp:** Our first encounter with the Titan of Time wasn't a direct fight, but a mind-bending trip. Being pulled into a temporal illusion of Asphodel—the lava-filled second biome from the original *Hades*—was a brilliant and unexpected narrative twist that caught us completely off guard and served as a great callback for fans of the first game.
* **A Surprise Sing-along:** Stumbling upon Apollo in the Crossroads and getting the prompt to join him in song was a wonderfully charming moment. The simple act of harmonizing, followed by chat's immediate and hilarious comparison of the background shades to Mr. Mushroom from *Hollow Knight*, was a perfect example of the fun, spontaneous community moments that make these streams special.

### Quotes of the Day

* ""Back in the day we just used to call it chilling, mad chilling if you were about it, y'knowm sayin'?"" - **StanRichson** (on the term ""Non-Sleep Deep Rest"")
* ""Early access bros just got it to flex it on their Steam profile"" - **OnionHelmet**
* ""I had a weird conversation earlier that kinda stumped me, not sure what to think, do you think anything that exists can be a first even if it's unique?"" - **daniel_and**
* ""Yeah you don't have muchroom to improve !"" - **daniel_and**
* ""We will consult Wittgenstein"" - **OnionHelmet**

### Key Concepts

* **NSDR (Non-Sleep Deep Rest):** A term popularized by neuroscientist Andrew Huberman describing protocols for entering a state of deep relaxation to accelerate recovery and learning. As we discussed, it's a modern term for what we used to just call ""chillin'."" For more, check out the **Huberman Lab Podcast**.
* **The Problem of ""Firsts"":** The philosophical puzzle, sparked by chat, of whether it's coherent to call something ""the first"" if it is definitionally unique and singular (e.g., ""the first everything"" or ""my first total life experience""). This touches on concepts in metaphysics and the philosophy of language. A great resource is the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (SEP) entry on **[Identity](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/identity/)**.
* **Ludwig Wittgenstein:** An influential 20th-century philosopher mentioned by chat. In the context of our discussion, his work is relevant because he often argued that deep philosophical problems are not questions about the world, but rather confusions arising from the misuse or misunderstanding of our own language. The SEP entry on **[Wittgenstein](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wittgenstein/)** is the definitive resource here.

This month has mostly been good for us. Its shown me there is possibility in deep connection with my husband, fun, love, romance, thoughtfulness. That he is so strong, capable, and giving. Ive learned to appreciate the most mundane and simple things that I've never appreciated before. Not just the action but the man behind them. The man I crushed in everyway, doing something for me like making me a cup of coffee. A task he used to do every morning and i never truly appreciated. I now appreciate him so much more. 

After a hard week of me being hospitalized for sepsis, him having to handle everything with the kids, and me coming home and picking up the pieces to our life again, we had the conversation. Well, it wasn't one i was expecting anyway. He told me hes been having a hard week with the thoughts of calling me his wife. He said its awkward and uncomfortable. He doesn't know if its a mixture of embarrassment because of my affair like people are judging him or what. He didn't really know how to explain it. And that he doesn't want to spend the rest of his life married to someone that he struggles to call his ""wife"". He said he didnt know what to do. That if i asked him 3 weeks ago when we were doing really well if we were going to keep working on this he would have said ""100% yes!"". But right now hes not sure. 

  
I tried my best to not push my feelings into his conversation. I just said that the whole picture matters. that we will have down weeks and we will have up weeks. And if you remember feeling that good about us and if you know that in that time you would have wanted to stay and keep working on this then its important to consider. I proposed we do another 90 days or something to that nature and he said okay. But then i said i wanted him to take control. To pick what he wanted to do. And he said okay and that he didnt know. I told him how much i loved him and wanted to keep working on our marriage. That I wouldn't give up. He seemed very shut down by the end of the conversation so i let him sleep. 

The reconciliation rollercoaster is a hard one. It goes good, really good, bad, really bad. I feel like there is not neutral. where things can be okay or good for a longer period of time. I hope and pray we can keep working on this and that those good moments last longer and longer as time goes on.

1nv79fs,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1nv79fs/my_grief_counseling_group_is_stealing_the_memory/,My Grief Counseling Group Is Stealing the Memory of My Brother From Me,"I’m typing this in the dark. My hands won’t stop shaking.

I know this is going to sound insane, but I swear I’m not paranoid — please, just listen.

I wasn’t going to post again. Not because I didn’t want to, but because I hoped the first session was just a weird coincidence.

After my younger brother Eli died in a car accident, my parents forced me into grief counseling. I expected stale coffee and awkward silences.

Instead, strangers described things about Eli that no one else could’ve known.

A green hoodie with a torn elbow pulled from the wreckage, orange popsicles he called “sun sticks,” and “All Apologies” by Nirvana, the song he used to play on repeat.

They spoke as if they were talking about their own dead brothers.

I panicked and deleted my post a few hours later, convinced that it was my brain trying to find patterns in my grief when there were none.

Just before I took it down, though, I added something — a memory Eli never had.

I made it up to prove I wasn’t losing my mind. To prove there was still one memory of my brother that belonged only to me.

I’ve been back to the group several times since then. Most of those sessions were uneventful — at least, nothing I could pin down as sinister.

But I went back tonight and I didn’t think it was about grief anymore.



I got there early, hoping to get ahead of the grief spiraling in my brain.

Jean’s gray-streaked bob stayed perfectly still as she watched me enter from her seat in the middle of the room, her notebook resting in her lap.

“Good to see you again, Lucas.”

I didn’t smile back, just gave a quick nod and avoided her sharp, green eyes.

I sat in the same uncomfortable plastic chair as last time as I watched Mark, Greg, Lillian, Jonah, and another person I hadn’t seen before shuffle in and take their seats.

I tried to remember what was said about Eli’s popsicle obsession, but it kept slipping away.

Had I mentioned the hoodie? I didn’t think so.

I’d done my best to tell myself that I was just suffering from a hyperactive imagination because after all, there was comfort in the panic, right?

My eyes landed on the rabbit-shaped coffee stain on the floor — darker now, like something was pushing up from beneath the tile.

I blinked, but it stayed. A jagged crack ran through its liquid features like a scar.

I rubbed my eyes, the line had vanished, but the rabbit was back. 

“Some things leave their mark, don’t they?” I heard Jean’s voice, but I never saw her lips move. It was as if her voice was inside my head.

That was when my ears picked up on something in the distance — a soft, off-key humming.

The opening chords of “All Apologies” drifted through the room slowly, almost methodically. It was quiet enough for me to think that maybe I was imagining it, but it was there, and the humming was growing louder behind me.

I turned my head slowly, my heartbeat rivaling the sound of the music.

I noticed that Jonah was sitting in his chair, rocking slightly from side to side. His chapped lips were barely parted, and his eyes were half-shut behind his square framed glasses like he was halfway between sleep and trance, but it was unmistakable, the melody was coming from him.

I leaned forward in my chair slightly. “Hey… you okay?”

His eyes opened sharply as if he had just woken up to a morning alarm.

He gave a light chuckle before smiling faintly:

“Why so jumpy, Rabbit?”

I felt my blood turn to ice. I hadn’t told anybody that nickname, not one time.

How did he know?

“What did you just call me?”

His brow furrowed. 

“I didn’t say anything, man. You alright?”

I shook my head and dropped the conversation with Jonah. 

I knew what I had heard.

Everyone else sat still — left hands curled around their paper cups; elbows bent in eerie symmetry.

It felt rehearsed, like a ritual they’d practiced.

I didn’t feel scared exactly — just disconnected. My body was in the room but my mind was elsewhere entirely.

I hadn’t even said that nickname aloud since Eli died. That was his name for me — something only he ever called me because I would jump at the sound of anything.

But now, others knew it.

How?

“I am losing my mind.” I thought to myself as I twiddled my fingers, waiting for the session to begin.

Jean’s smile tightened like something crawled behind her teeth.

“No you’re not, dear.”

Had I spoken aloud and didn’t realize?

I blinked in confusion and was met a look from Jean that suggested that I had been staring for too long.

“Thanks.” I responded briefly as I did my best to calm my rattled self.

Eventually, Jean asked us to once again “share a memory” and this time, Lillian volunteered to go first.

Her fingers danced over the leather bracelet  on her left wrist in tight, practiced loops.

“He dotted his i’s with tiny bubble circles.”

My stomach lurched; Eli used to do that. His school assignments always appeared vandalized by balloons.

Jean nodded slowly.

“That’s a beautiful memory, Lillian. Thank you for sharing. That’s yours now.”

Why did she say it like that? Like she was giving it away.

There was no time to dwell on that as Greg went next. His knuckles were red from being rubbed raw — a habit he didn’t seem aware of.

“He avoided spaghetti at all costs because he thought the sauce smelled like pennies.”

When it was my turn, I opened my mouth... but nothing came out, not even a whisper.

I frantically searched my brain for something — anything — about Eli that hadn’t already been said. 

The harder I tried to remember, the faster it all evaporated — like breath on glass.

I could remember his face, but when I reached for the little things like his laugh or his habits, they slipped through my fingers.

“Come back to me.” I grunted, dismissing my turn so I could ponder everything further.

I received a stern look from Jean as she reluctantly made the new person introduce himself. 

He was pale, lanky, and nervous, with sandy hair sticking up at the crown of his head.

“I’m Shane,” he spoke softly. “My brother—Ben—he was hit by a drunk driver a few years ago.”

The silence sat for so long I wasn’t sure he was going to speak again, until he finally did.

“We used to build these massive Lego castles together. He’d always insist on putting the flag on the top because he said it wasn’t a ‘real fortress’ without the flag.”

“You don’t know him! Stop pretending you do!” 

The words ripped out of me before I realized  I’d sat up straighter in my chair. My throat burned with shame, but nobody looked surprised.

“Lucas, no speaking out of turn.” Jean tilted her head. “You don’t want to lose him again, do you, Rabbit?” 

“What did you just say?” My tone now turning combative.

“I was telling Mark to go ahead.”

“That’s definitely not what you said.” I grumbled with clenched fists, earning glares from the others.

Mark leaned forward in his seat; his eyes a little watery as he recounted his memory. 

“He had this real wide gap between his front teeth. I thought he looked like a rabbit because of it.”

My eyes widened as my head snapped towards the coffee stain on the floor, the one that resembled a rabbit.

Except, it wasn’t a rabbit anymore.

It was a devilish grin with two wide, stained teeth, shimmering like dampened ink across the tile.

I watched as the smile stretched and widened, it’s proportions growing with every second before it disappeared in the blink of an eye.

I shivered in my chair as I clutched myself tightly, the room seemingly dropping in temperature as I listened to Jonah speak.

“That dinosaur shirt. You remember the one? Yellow, raggedy thing with the little hole under the armpit? He wouldn’t take it off. He wore it everywhere he could..”

“Stop it,” I spoke through gritted teeth.

They didn’t listen, one by one they spoke Eli into the room — in fragments of hobbies, phrases, and inside jokes. 

Each detail carved into me like glass under the skin.

Then Lillian said something that made me shudder.

“He used to say clouds were made of cotton candy and dead dreams every time we drove past the old park.”

The words fell from her mouth like they’d always belonged to her.

But that was mine. That was the one thing Eli never said.

I felt sick, the world began to spin and tilt around me.

I reached into my backpack for my water — and my fingers brushed fabric.

Confused, I pulled it from my backpack.

It was Eli’s hoodie. 

It was torn at the elbow, the fabric was damp, faintly smelling of gasoline and scorched plastic. 

Someone had folded it neatly into my backpack. 

The dampness seeped into my palm as if it had been waiting for me in the wreck this whole time.

Inside the collar:

“To Rabbit – You’ll always be my player two.”

I remember Eli writing this on the inside of a birthday card he had given me once.

This was after we had spent hours, days, and weeks grinding different video games together. 

That was our memory, no one else knew that…right?

I glanced at Jean, half-expecting her to react. Instead, she was watching me, like she’d been waiting to see my face crumple at the sight of that ratty hoodie. 

She didn’t even blink as I stood up in anger.

“These aren’t your memories,” I declared, louder than I meant to. “You’re not talking about your brothers. You’re talking about mine.”

The room stood still, the only sound I could hear was my heartbeat, thudding in my chest.

But then, Jean’s expression shifted to reveal a smile that was wrong in every possible way.

“Lucas, I know this is hard for you, but don’t interrupt the process.”

Mark looked up at me with a slow, deliberate frown.

“Why are you so scared, Rabbit?”

“You’ve always been here.” Lillian chimed in, her eyes looking like they were going to protrude from their sockets.

The color drained from my face as words failed me.

They smiled in unison — not real smiles, but ones carved into their faces like wax figures left too long in the sun.

I took a step back, and that’s when the lights began to flicker.

Once…twice…until complete darkness.

I could only see their silhouettes faintly sitting in their chairs, like chess pieces that had never moved.

I went to leave when I heard the humming begin.

It started out low, but slowly crept to a crescendo as the sound of static crackled to life somewhere behind me.

The first, dissonant chords of “All Apologies” leaked out like rot through the community center. 

It was so distorted and warbled that it sounded like something dying was dragging itself across the room.

The voices started again except they weren’t speaking anymore.

They were mimicking and echoing Eli’s laugh…his voice…his humming.

One by one, I listened to his words leaving their mouths in the pitch black like they were chewing them up…and spitting them back at me.

I sat there trying to picture Eli’s face again, but for a moment, all I could see was the hoodie.

What kind of brother forgets that?

Greg’s head twitched in violent spasms, his neck bending at a sharp, almost impossible angle as he whispered:

“Sun sticks. You remember sun sticks?”

Jonah’s smile stretched almost past his nose. His eyes two flat pits of shadow.

“He said clouds were made of candy and dead dreams.”

I tripped backward over my chair, landing hard with a thud.

The coffee stain shimmered like pond water, rippling under the flickering emergency light.

It was grinning and I watched in horror as its teeth grew huge, and the stain seemingly took a life of its own.

The melody of the song looped repeatedly, bent and broken until it sounded like screeches of agony in reverse.

“Player two,” Lillian whispered, her voice trembling with excitement. “We saved the castle together. Remember?”

I heard joints cracking like tree branches in quick succession as something started crawling across the floor slowly.

Bones scraped across the tile as a labored wheeze thick with phlegm came closer to where I stood.

I turned to run but it grabbed my ankle, its grip firm but slippery like a hand covered in oil.

“I’ve fed on softer hearts than yours.” Jean’s voice echoed in my thoughts as I kicked hard and stumbled to my feet. 

I ran as fast as my feet could carry me until I slammed into the doorframe.

I fumbled with the lock in a frantic struggle. Then—lights exploded back on, and the music stopped.

The room had returned to normal — everyone was still in place, like chess pieces that never moved.

Jean sipped her coffee as she stared at the terrified expression on my face.

I didn’t say goodbye.

With my heart still racing, I grabbed my backpack and ran the whole way home without looking back once.



My mom asked about the session, but I didn’t dare tell her what I saw, not even a fraction of it.

I couldn’t even really put into words what I experienced.

All I told her was that it was fine and that I walked home because I needed the fresh air from how heavy it got today.

I went upstairs to my room and closed the door hopelessly gaslighting myself into thinking that a thin piece of wood could keep the horrors out.

All I could think about were those dying lights, the way their faces shifted, and a name I hadn’t heard in months being spoken again.

I dumped my backpack onto the bed, but the hoodie was gone.

I swore I had it — hadn’t I taken it out?

Then I saw it, folded neatly at the foot of my bed.

I knew I hadn’t brought it home; I would have remembered

I curled up on the bed, wiping at tears I didn’t remember shedding. The grief was still there, but I felt hollow — like my body was going through the motions without me.

All I kept repeating in my head was:

“He called me Rabbit.”

I don’t know how long I sat there in uninterrupted silence but the sound of my phone lowly buzzing in my pocket snapped me out of my thoughts.

I didn’t recognize the number and just let it go to voicemail.

If it is important, they will leave one.

But the number kept calling me, no matter how many times I silenced or blocked it.

In a moment that I would come to regret, I answered the phone on the seventh try.

First came the static — gnawing through the speaker angrily.

Then the warped twang of “All Apologies,” every note nauseatingly dragged out as if it were being played from a melted cassette tape. 

It sounded more like a funeral than a song.

I pressed the phone harder to my ear before I realized my hands were slick with sweat.

Underneath the layers of distortion, words manifested themselves.

“You shouldn’t have deleted me, Rabbit,” said a voice that almost sounded like Eli.

I whispered his name before the line clicked dead.

“No no no no no.” I repeated as I felt the phone drop from my hand to the bedroom floor. 

I knelt to pick up the phone, but my hand brushed something else.

There, on the floor beside my bed, was a popsicle stick.

“Sun stick,” written in messy, orange marker.

It was unmistakably Eli’s handwriting.

I didn’t know if I was shaking from fear or from the kind of cold that creeps inside when nothing makes sense anymore.

I crawled under my bed and pulled out an old box I had tucked away, I hadn’t touched it since the funeral.

Inside were pictures of crayon monsters with jagged teeth and drawing of our Lego fortress.

After a couple moments of quick searching through the contents of bittersweet nostalgia, I found the picture I was looking for.

It was Eli, he was around eight years old, and he was grinning wide with both front teeth missing, holding up a Lego castle with a tiny red flag.

I could hear his voice clear as day in my head:

“It’s not real without the flag.”

I felt myself choking back tears as I remembered begging him to play video games with me that day.

If only he had stayed home, he would still be my player two.

My chest stiffened with the memory of his laugh, that pure, careless joy. 

Maybe I’m the reason he’s gone, and that’s why I keep hearing him.

I ran my thumb over the photo, over Eli’s gap-toothed grin. Tears fell from my eyes.

I shut the box, the memories felt radioactive.

A dark thought crossed my mind: 

What if none of them are lying?

What if they’re not sharing stories?

What if they’re taking turns carving him out of me piece by piece?

The sun sticks, the castle, the damn fake memory?

It was the only explanation I had to rationalize the things I was seeing.

But if they can steal something that was never real…what exactly does that make them?

And worse, what does that make me?



It’s late at night.

I haven’t slept and I don’t think I honestly want to.

I heard my mom answer the phone downstairs earlier. 

Jean called to make sure I had made it home safely. 

Something else was said but mom wouldn’t tell me what. 

“It’ll all come back to you.” Is what she told me.

All I could picture was Jean’s smile — the one that always knew more than it said.

I’m not just losing Eli — I’m losing myself.

If anyone out there has ever heard of a grief group like this or anything even remotely similar, I must know.

I’m not sure if I should go back but I feel like the only way I’ll get answers is to keep going.

I’m scared I’ll forget his voice next.

If I forget him completely…did I ever really have a brother at all?

God, that sounds messed up. But I don’t know how else to say it.

I’ll update whenever I go back again.

I promise to stay safe and keep in touch with you all as much as I can.

“Sun sticks. You remember sun sticks?”

Jonah’s smile stretched almost past his nose. His eyes two flat pits of shadow.

“He said clouds were made of candy and dead dreams.”

I tripped backward over my chair, landing hard with a thud.

The coffee stain shimmered like pond water, rippling under the flickering emergency light.

It was grinning and I watched in horror as its teeth grew huge, and the stain seemingly took a life of its own.

The melody of the song looped repeatedly, bent and broken until it sounded like screeches of agony in reverse.

“Player two,” Lillian whispered, her voice trembling with excitement. “We saved the castle together. Remember?”

I heard joints cracking like tree branches in quick succession as something started crawling across the floor slowly.

Bones scraped across the tile as a labored wheeze thick with phlegm came closer to where I stood.

I turned to run but it grabbed my ankle, its grip firm but slippery like a hand covered in oil.

“I’ve fed on softer hearts than yours.” Jean’s voice echoed in my thoughts as I kicked hard and stumbled to my feet. 

I ran as fast as my feet could carry me until I slammed into the doorframe.

I fumbled with the lock in a frantic struggle. Then—lights exploded back on, and the music stopped.

The room had returned to normal — everyone was still in place, like chess pieces that never moved.

Jean sipped her coffee as she stared at the terrified expression on my face.

I didn’t say goodbye.

With my heart still racing, I grabbed my backpack and ran the whole way home without looking back once.



My mom asked about the session, but I didn’t dare tell her what I saw, not even a fraction of it.

I couldn’t even really put into words what I experienced.

All I told her was that it was fine and that I walked home because I needed the fresh air from how heavy it got today.

I went upstairs to my room and closed the door hopelessly gaslighting myself into thinking that a thin piece of wood could keep the horrors out.

All I could think about were those dying lights, the way their faces shifted, and a name I hadn’t heard in months being spoken again.

I dumped my backpack onto the bed, but the hoodie was gone.

I swore I had it — hadn’t I taken it out?

Then I saw it, folded neatly at the foot of my bed.

I knew I hadn’t brought it home; I would have remembered

I curled up on the bed, wiping at tears I didn’t remember shedding. The grief was still there, but I felt hollow — like my body was going through the motions without me.

All I kept repeating in my head was:

“He called me Rabbit.”

I don’t know how long I sat there in uninterrupted silence but the sound of my phone lowly buzzing in my pocket snapped me out of my thoughts.

I didn’t recognize the number and just let it go to voicemail.

If it is important, they will leave one.

But the number kept calling me, no matter how many times I silenced or blocked it.

In a moment that I would come to regret, I answered the phone on the seventh try.

First came the static — gnawing through the speaker angrily.

Then the warped twang of “All Apologies,” every note nauseatingly dragged out as if it were being played from a melted cassette tape. 

It sounded more like a funeral than a song.

I pressed the phone harder to my ear before I realized my hands were slick with sweat.

Underneath the layers of distortion, words manifested themselves.

“You shouldn’t have deleted me, Rabbit,” said a voice that almost sounded like Eli.

I whispered his name before the line clicked dead.

“No no no no no.” I repeated as I felt the phone drop from my hand to the bedroom floor. 

I knelt to pick up the phone, but my hand brushed something else.

There, on the floor beside my bed, was a popsicle stick.

“Sun stick,” written in messy, orange marker.

It was unmistakably Eli’s handwriting.

I didn’t know if I was shaking from fear or from the kind of cold that creeps inside when nothing makes sense anymore.

I crawled under my bed and pulled out an old box I had tucked away, I hadn’t touched it since the funeral.

Inside were pictures of crayon monsters with jagged teeth and drawing of our Lego fortress.

After a couple moments of quick searching through the contents of bittersweet nostalgia, I found the picture I was looking for.

It was Eli, he was around eight years old, and he was grinning wide with both front teeth missing, holding up a Lego castle with a tiny red flag.

I could hear his voice clear as day in my head:

“It’s not real without the flag.”

I felt myself choking back tears as I remembered begging him to play video games with me that day.

If only he had stayed home, he would still be my player two.

My chest stiffened with the memory of his laugh, that pure, careless joy. 

Maybe I’m the reason he’s gone, and that’s why I keep hearing him.

I ran my thumb over the photo, over Eli’s gap-toothed grin. Tears fell from my eyes.

I shut the box, the memories felt radioactive.

A dark thought crossed my mind: 

What if none of them are lying?

What if they’re not sharing stories?

What if they’re taking turns carving him out of me piece by piece?

The sun sticks, the castle, the damn fake memory?

It was the only explanation I had to rationalize the things I was seeing.

But if they can steal something that was never real…what exactly does that make them?

And worse, what does that make me?



It’s late at night.

I haven’t slept and I don’t think I honestly want to.

I heard my mom answer the phone downstairs earlier. 

Jean called to make sure I had made it home safely. 

Something else was said but mom wouldn’t tell me what. 

“It’ll all come back to you.” Is what she told me.

All I could picture was Jean’s smile — the one that always knew more than it said.

I’m not just losing Eli — I’m losing myself.

If anyone out there has ever heard of a grief group like this or anything even remotely similar, I must know.

I’m not sure if I should go back but I feel like the only way I’ll get answers is to keep going.

I’m scared I’ll forget his voice next.

If I forget him completely…did I ever really have a brother at all?

God, that sounds messed up. But I don’t know how else to say it.

I’ll update whenever I go back again.

I promise to stay safe and keep in touch with you all as much as I can.

I know this is going to sound insane, but I swear I’m not paranoid — please, just listen.

I wasn’t going to post again. Not because I didn’t want to, but because I hoped the first session was just a weird coincidence.

After my younger brother Eli died in a car accident, my parents forced me into grief counseling. I expected stale coffee and awkward silences.

Instead, strangers described things about Eli that no one else could’ve known.

A green hoodie with a torn elbow pulled from the wreckage, orange popsicles he called “sun sticks,” and “All Apologies” by Nirvana, the song he used to play on repeat.

They spoke as if they were talking about their own dead brothers.

I panicked and deleted my post a few hours later, convinced that it was my brain trying to find patterns in my grief when there were none.

Just before I took it down, though, I added something — a memory Eli never had.

I made it up to prove I wasn’t losing my mind. To prove there was still one memory of my brother that belonged only to me.

I’ve been back to the group several times since then. Most of those sessions were uneventful — at least, nothing I could pin down as sinister.

But I went back tonight and I didn’t think it was about grief anymore.



I got there early, hoping to get ahead of the grief spiraling in my brain.

Jean’s gray-streaked bob stayed perfectly still as she watched me enter from her seat in the middle of the room, her notebook resting in her lap.

“Good to see you again, Lucas.”

I didn’t smile back, just gave a quick nod and avoided her sharp, green eyes.

I sat in the same uncomfortable plastic chair as last time as I watched Mark, Greg, Lillian, Jonah, and another person I hadn’t seen before shuffle in and take their seats.

I tried to remember what was said about Eli’s popsicle obsession, but it kept slipping away.

Had I mentioned the hoodie? I didn’t think so.

I’d done my best to tell myself that I was just suffering from a hyperactive imagination because after all, there was comfort in the panic, right?

My eyes landed on the rabbit-shaped coffee stain on the floor — darker now, like something was pushing up from beneath the tile.

I blinked, but it stayed. A jagged crack ran through its liquid features like a scar.

I rubbed my eyes, the line had vanished, but the rabbit was back. 

“Some things leave their mark, don’t they?” I heard Jean’s voice, but I never saw her lips move. It was as if her voice was inside my head.

That was when my ears picked up on something in the distance — a soft, off-key humming.

The opening chords of “All Apologies” drifted through the room slowly, almost methodically. It was quiet enough for me to think that maybe I was imagining it, but it was there, and the humming was growing louder behind me.

I turned my head slowly, my heartbeat rivaling the sound of the music.

I noticed that Jonah was sitting in his chair, rocking slightly from side to side. His chapped lips were barely parted, and his eyes were half-shut behind his square framed glasses like he was halfway between sleep and trance, but it was unmistakable, the melody was coming from him.

I leaned forward in my chair slightly. “Hey… you okay?”

His eyes opened sharply as if he had just woken up to a morning alarm.

He gave a light chuckle before smiling faintly:

“Why so jumpy, Rabbit?”

I felt my blood turn to ice. I hadn’t told anybody that nickname, not one time.

How did he know?

“What did you just call me?”

His brow furrowed. 

“I didn’t say anything, man. You alright?”

I shook my head and dropped the conversation with Jonah. 

I knew what I had heard.

Everyone else sat still — left hands curled around their paper cups; elbows bent in eerie symmetry.

It felt rehearsed, like a ritual they’d practiced.

I didn’t feel scared exactly — just disconnected. My body was in the room but my mind was elsewhere entirely.

I hadn’t even said that nickname aloud since Eli died. That was his name for me — something only he ever called me because I would jump at the sound of anything.

But now, others knew it.

How?

“I am losing my mind.” I thought to myself as I twiddled my fingers, waiting for the session to begin.

Jean’s smile tightened like something crawled behind her teeth.

“No you’re not, dear.”

Had I spoken aloud and didn’t realize?

I blinked in confusion and was met a look from Jean that suggested that I had been staring for too long.

“Thanks.” I responded briefly as I did my best to calm my rattled self.

Eventually, Jean asked us to once again “share a memory” and this time, Lillian volunteered to go first.

Her fingers danced over the leather bracelet  on her left wrist in tight, practiced loops.

“He dotted his i’s with tiny bubble circles.”

My stomach lurched; Eli used to do that. His school assignments always appeared vandalized by balloons.

Jean nodded slowly.

“That’s a beautiful memory, Lillian. Thank you for sharing. That’s yours now.”

Why did she say it like that? Like she was giving it away.

There was no time to dwell on that as Greg went next. His knuckles were red from being rubbed raw — a habit he didn’t seem aware of.

“He avoided spaghetti at all costs because he thought the sauce smelled like pennies.”

When it was my turn, I opened my mouth... but nothing came out, not even a whisper.

I frantically searched my brain for something — anything — about Eli that hadn’t already been said. 

The harder I tried to remember, the faster it all evaporated — like breath on glass.

I could remember his face, but when I reached for the little things like his laugh or his habits, they slipped through my fingers.

“Come back to me.” I grunted, dismissing my turn so I could ponder everything further.

I received a stern look from Jean as she reluctantly made the new person introduce himself. 

He was pale, lanky, and nervous, with sandy hair sticking up at the crown of his head.

“I’m Shane,” he spoke softly. “My brother—Ben—he was hit by a drunk driver a few years ago.”

The silence sat for so long I wasn’t sure he was going to speak again, until he finally did.

“We used to build these massive Lego castles together. He’d always insist on putting the flag on the top because he said it wasn’t a ‘real fortress’ without the flag.”

“You don’t know him! Stop pretending you do!” 

The words ripped out of me before I realized  I’d sat up straighter in my chair. My throat burned with shame, but nobody looked surprised.

“Lucas, no speaking out of turn.” Jean tilted her head. “You don’t want to lose him again, do you, Rabbit?” 

“What did you just say?” My tone now turning combative.

“I was telling Mark to go ahead.”

“That’s definitely not what you said.” I grumbled with clenched fists, earning glares from the others.

Mark leaned forward in his seat; his eyes a little watery as he recounted his memory. 

“He had this real wide gap between his front teeth. I thought he looked like a rabbit because of it.”

My eyes widened as my head snapped towards the coffee stain on the floor, the one that resembled a rabbit.

Except, it wasn’t a rabbit anymore.

It was a devilish grin with two wide, stained teeth, shimmering like dampened ink across the tile.

I watched as the smile stretched and widened, it’s proportions growing with every second before it disappeared in the blink of an eye.

I shivered in my chair as I clutched myself tightly, the room seemingly dropping in temperature as I listened to Jonah speak.

“That dinosaur shirt. You remember the one? Yellow, raggedy thing with the little hole under the armpit? He wouldn’t take it off. He wore it everywhere he could..”

“Stop it,” I spoke through gritted teeth.

They didn’t listen, one by one they spoke Eli into the room — in fragments of hobbies, phrases, and inside jokes. 

Each detail carved into me like glass under the skin.

Then Lillian said something that made me shudder.

“He used to say clouds were made of cotton candy and dead dreams every time we drove past the old park.”

The words fell from her mouth like they’d always belonged to her.

But that was mine. That was the one thing Eli never said.

I felt sick, the world began to spin and tilt around me.

I reached into my backpack for my water — and my fingers brushed fabric.

Confused, I pulled it from my backpack.

It was Eli’s hoodie. 

It was torn at the elbow, the fabric was damp, faintly smelling of gasoline and scorched plastic. 

Someone had folded it neatly into my backpack. 

The dampness seeped into my palm as if it had been waiting for me in the wreck this whole time.

Inside the collar:

“To Rabbit – You’ll always be my player two.”

I remember Eli writing this on the inside of a birthday card he had given me once.

This was after we had spent hours, days, and weeks grinding different video games together. 

That was our memory, no one else knew that…right?

I glanced at Jean, half-expecting her to react. Instead, she was watching me, like she’d been waiting to see my face crumple at the sight of that ratty hoodie. 

She didn’t even blink as I stood up in anger.

“These aren’t your memories,” I declared, louder than I meant to. “You’re not talking about your brothers. You’re talking about mine.”

The room stood still, the only sound I could hear was my heartbeat, thudding in my chest.

But then, Jean’s expression shifted to reveal a smile that was wrong in every possible way.

“Lucas, I know this is hard for you, but don’t interrupt the process.”

Mark looked up at me with a slow, deliberate frown.

“Why are you so scared, Rabbit?”

“You’ve always been here.” Lillian chimed in, her eyes looking like they were going to protrude from their sockets.

The color drained from my face as words failed me.

They smiled in unison — not real smiles, but ones carved into their faces like wax figures left too long in the sun.

I took a step back, and that’s when the lights began to flicker.

Once…twice…until complete darkness.

I could only see their silhouettes faintly sitting in their chairs, like chess pieces that had never moved.

I went to leave when I heard the humming begin.

It started out low, but slowly crept to a crescendo as the sound of static crackled to life somewhere behind me.

The first, dissonant chords of “All Apologies” leaked out like rot through the community center. 

It was so distorted and warbled that it sounded like something dying was dragging itself across the room.

The voices started again except they weren’t speaking anymore.

They were mimicking and echoing Eli’s laugh…his voice…his humming.

One by one, I listened to his words leaving their mouths in the pitch black like they were chewing them up…and spitting them back at me.

I sat there trying to picture Eli’s face again, but for a moment, all I could see was the hoodie.

What kind of brother forgets that?

Greg’s head twitched in violent spasms, his neck bending at a sharp, almost impossible angle as he whispered:

“Sun sticks. You remember sun sticks?”

Jonah’s smile stretched almost past his nose. His eyes two flat pits of shadow.

“He said clouds were made of candy and dead dreams.”

I tripped backward over my chair, landing hard with a thud.

The coffee stain shimmered like pond water, rippling under the flickering emergency light.

It was grinning and I watched in horror as its teeth grew huge, and the stain seemingly took a life of its own.

The melody of the song looped repeatedly, bent and broken until it sounded like screeches of agony in reverse.

“Player two,” Lillian whispered, her voice trembling with excitement. “We saved the castle together. Remember?”

I heard joints cracking like tree branches in quick succession as something started crawling across the floor slowly.

Bones scraped across the tile as a labored wheeze thick with phlegm came closer to where I stood.

I turned to run but it grabbed my ankle, its grip firm but slippery like a hand covered in oil.

“I’ve fed on softer hearts than yours.” Jean’s voice echoed in my thoughts as I kicked hard and stumbled to my feet.

I shut the box, the memories felt radioactive.

Mark leaned forward in his seat; his eyes a little watery as he recounted his memory. 

“He had this real wide gap between his front teeth. I thought he looked like a rabbit because of it.”

My eyes widened as my head snapped towards the coffee stain on the floor, the one that resembled a rabbit.

Except, it wasn’t a rabbit anymore.

It was a devilish grin with two wide, stained teeth, shimmering like dampened ink across the tile.

I watched as the smile stretched and widened, it’s proportions growing with every second before it disappeared in the blink of an eye.

I shivered in my chair as I clutched myself tightly, the room seemingly dropping in temperature as I listened to Jonah speak.

“That dinosaur shirt. You remember the one? Yellow, raggedy thing with the little hole under the armpit? He wouldn’t take it off. He wore it everywhere he could..”

“Stop it,” I spoke through gritted teeth.

They didn’t listen, one by one they spoke Eli into the room — in fragments of hobbies, phrases, and inside jokes. 

Each detail carved into me like glass under the skin.

Then Lillian said something that made me shudder.

“He used to say clouds were made of cotton candy and dead dreams every time we drove past the old park.”

The words fell from her mouth like they’d always belonged to her.

But that was mine. That was the one thing Eli never said.

I felt sick, the world began to spin and tilt around me.

I reached into my backpack for my water — and my fingers brushed fabric.

Confused, I pulled it from my backpack.

It was Eli’s hoodie. 

It was torn at the elbow, the fabric was damp, faintly smelling of gasoline and scorched plastic. 

Someone had folded it neatly into my backpack. 

The dampness seeped into my palm as if it had been waiting for me in the wreck this whole time.

Inside the collar:

“To Rabbit – You’ll always be my player two.”

I remember Eli writing this on the inside of a birthday card he had given me once.

This was after we had spent hours, days, and weeks grinding different video games together. 

That was our memory, no one else knew that…right?

I glanced at Jean, half-expecting her to react. Instead, she was watching me, like she’d been waiting to see my face crumple at the sight of that ratty hoodie. 

She didn’t even blink as I stood up in anger.

“These aren’t your memories,” I declared, louder than I meant to. “You’re not talking about your brothers. You’re talking about mine.”

The room stood still, the only sound I could hear was my heartbeat, thudding in my chest.

But then, Jean’s expression shifted to reveal a smile that was wrong in every possible way.

“Lucas, I know this is hard for you, but don’t interrupt the process.”

Mark looked up at me with a slow, deliberate frown.

“Why are you so scared, Rabbit?”

“You’ve always been here.” Lillian chimed in, her eyes looking like they were going to protrude from their sockets.

The color drained from my face as words failed me.

They smiled in unison — not real smiles, but ones carved into their faces like wax figures left too long in the sun.

I took a step back, and that’s when the lights began to flicker.

Once…twice…until complete darkness.

I could only see their silhouettes faintly sitting in their chairs, like chess pieces that had never moved.

I went to leave when I heard the humming begin.

It started out low, but slowly crept to a crescendo as the sound of static crackled to life somewhere behind me.

The first, dissonant chords of “All Apologies” leaked out like rot through the community center. 

It was so distorted and warbled that it sounded like something dying was dragging itself across the room.

The voices started again except they weren’t speaking anymore.

They were mimicking and echoing Eli’s laugh…his voice…his humming.

One by one, I listened to his words leaving their mouths in the pitch black like they were chewing them up…and spitting them back at me.

I sat there trying to picture Eli’s face again, but for a moment, all I could see was the hoodie.

What kind of brother forgets that?

Greg’s head twitched in violent spasms, his neck bending at a sharp, almost impossible angle as he whispered:

“Sun sticks. You remember sun sticks?”

Jonah’s smile stretched almost past his nose. His eyes two flat pits of shadow.

“He said clouds were made of candy and dead dreams.”

I tripped backward over my chair, landing hard with a thud.

The coffee stain shimmered like pond water, rippling under the flickering emergency light.

It was grinning and I watched in horror as its teeth grew huge, and the stain seemingly took a life of its own.

The melody of the song looped repeatedly, bent and broken until it sounded like screeches of agony in reverse.

“Player two,” Lillian whispered, her voice trembling with excitement. “We saved the castle together. Remember?”

I heard joints cracking like tree branches in quick succession as something started crawling across the floor slowly.

Bones scraped across the tile as a labored wheeze thick with phlegm came closer to where I stood.

I turned to run but it grabbed my ankle, its grip firm but slippery like a hand covered in oil.

“I’ve fed on softer hearts than yours.” Jean’s voice echoed in my thoughts as I kicked hard and stumbled to my feet. 

I ran as fast as my feet could carry me until I slammed into the doorframe.

I fumbled with the lock in a frantic struggle. Then—lights exploded back on, and the music stopped.

The room had returned to normal — everyone was still in place, like chess pieces that never moved.

Jean sipped her coffee as she stared at the terrified expression on my face.

I didn’t say goodbye.

With my heart still racing, I grabbed my backpack and ran the whole way home without looking back once.



My mom asked about the session, but I didn’t dare tell her what I saw, not even a fraction of it.

I couldn’t even really put into words what I experienced.

All I told her was that it was fine and that I walked home because I needed the fresh air from how heavy it got today.

I went upstairs to my room and closed the door hopelessly gaslighting myself into thinking that a thin piece of wood could keep the horrors out.

All I could think about were those dying lights, the way their faces shifted, and a name I hadn’t heard in months being spoken again.

I dumped my backpack onto the bed, but the hoodie was gone.

I swore I had it — hadn’t I taken it out?

Then I saw it, folded neatly at the foot of my bed.

I knew I hadn’t brought it home; I would have remembered

I curled up on the bed, wiping at tears I didn’t remember shedding. The grief was still there, but I felt hollow — like my body was going through the motions without me.

All I kept repeating in my head was:

“He called me Rabbit.”

I don’t know how long I sat there in uninterrupted silence but the sound of my phone lowly buzzing in my pocket snapped me out of my thoughts.

I didn’t recognize the number and just let it go to voicemail.

If it is important, they will leave one.

But the number kept calling me, no matter how many times I silenced or blocked it.

In a moment that I would come to regret, I answered the phone on the seventh try.

First came the static — gnawing through the speaker angrily.

Then the warped twang of “All Apologies,” every note nauseatingly dragged out as if it were being played from a melted cassette tape. 

It sounded more like a funeral than a song.

I pressed the phone harder to my ear before I realized my hands were slick with sweat.

Underneath the layers of distortion, words manifested themselves.

“You shouldn’t have deleted me, Rabbit,” said a voice that almost sounded like Eli.

I whispered his name before the line clicked dead.

“No no no no no.” I repeated as I felt the phone drop from my hand to the bedroom floor. 

I knelt to pick up the phone, but my hand brushed something else.

There, on the floor beside my bed, was a popsicle stick.

“Sun stick,” written in messy, orange marker.

It was unmistakably Eli’s handwriting.

I didn’t know if I was shaking from fear or from the kind of cold that creeps inside when nothing makes sense anymore.

I crawled under my bed and pulled out an old box I had tucked away, I hadn’t touched it since the funeral.

Inside were pictures of crayon monsters with jagged teeth and drawing of our Lego fortress.

After a couple moments of quick searching through the contents of bittersweet nostalgia, I found the picture I was looking for.

It was Eli, he was around eight years old, and he was grinning wide with both front teeth missing, holding up a Lego castle with a tiny red flag.

I could hear his voice clear as day in my head:

“It’s not real without the flag.”

I felt myself choking back tears as I remembered begging him to play video games with me that day.

If only he had stayed home, he would still be my player two.

My chest stiffened with the memory of his laugh, that pure, careless joy. 

Maybe I’m the reason he’s gone, and that’s why I keep hearing him.

I ran my thumb over the photo, over Eli’s gap-toothed grin. Tears fell from my eyes.

I shut the box, the memories felt radioactive.

A dark thought crossed my mind: 

What if none of them are lying?

What if they’re not sharing stories?

What if they’re taking turns carving him out of me piece by piece?

The sun sticks, the castle, the damn fake memory?

It was the only explanation I had to rationalize the things I was seeing.

But if they can steal something that was never real…what exactly does that make them?

And worse, what does that make me?



It’s late at night.

I haven’t slept and I don’t think I honestly want to.

I heard my mom answer the phone downstairs earlier. 

Jean called to make sure I had made it home safely. 

Something else was said but mom wouldn’t tell me what. 

“It’ll all come back to you.” Is what she told me.

All I could picture was Jean’s smile — the one that always knew more than it said.

I’m not just losing Eli — I’m losing myself.

If anyone out there has ever heard of a grief group like this or anything even remotely similar, I must know.

I’m not sure if I should go back but I feel like the only way I’ll get answers is to keep going.

I’m scared I’ll forget his voice next.

If I forget him completely…did I ever really have a brother at all?

God, that sounds messed up. But I don’t know how else to say it.

I’ll update whenever I go back again.

I promise to stay safe and keep in touch with you all as much as I can.

A few quick facts about my setup and requirements:

* Location: Europe.
* Placement: projector sits on a coffee table \~2 m from the screen (short-throw is important).
* Screen: white tripod screen (basic portable screen with its own support).
* I can probably buy a new one within the budget if need be.
* Image size target: \~100"" diagonal at about 2.0 m from the screen.
* Resolution: 4K
* Use: mostly movies/TV and occasional gaming (e.g., Mario Kart). Latency is not critical but don’t want terrible input lag.
* Budget: tight — **under €1000 total**, including the projector *and* a new tripod screen.
* Audio: I have a 3.5 Jack stereo setup.

I might be asking for the moon here, but I'm willing to compromise, appreciate any recommendations.

1nv74qs,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExtroIntrovertSG/comments/1nv74qs/welcome_to_extrointrovert_sg_coffee_chats_chill/,"Welcome to ExtroIntrovert SG - Coffee, Chats & Chill","Hey everyone! 👋

Welcome to ExtroIntrovert SG! This space is for people in Singapore who want low-pressure, genuine connections — whether it’s coffee, board games, walks, movies, or just casual chats.

Right now, the focus is on creating a chill hangout group, like those moments when you just feel at home but don’t have plans with anyone — a space to step out, connect, and just be yourself.

But my bigger goal is to build a dedicated group of friendships that can last a lifetime and beyond. I want everyone here to genuinely feel supported during their lows, celebrate their highs together, accomplish meaningful things as a team, and grow into better versions of themselves. This is about living intentionally, building better lives for ourselves and those around us, and experiencing life fully rather than letting time pass by alone.

1️⃣ Meetups & Safety

Once everyone feels comfortable, we can arrange in-person meetups.

I understand meeting strangers in person can feel scary, especially in smaller groups. I’ll be present at meetups, and if anything goes wrong, I’ll take appropriate action, including seeking help legally if needed.

This is a safe, friendly space — harassment, bullying, toxic behavior, or sketchy activities (like pressuring others to drink, smoke, or join MLMs) are strictly not condoned.

Respect boundaries: if someone expresses discomfort verbally or through body language, please stop and don’t insist.

2️⃣ Icebreakers & Getting Comfortable

Before meeting in person, we can do online icebreakers: text chat, small games, or voice hangouts.

We can also vote on how we want to start — online first, in-person first, or a mix. The goal is to make it easy for everyone to feel comfortable and included.

3️⃣ Community Vibe & Guidelines

Totally free — we just cover our own expenses when meeting.

Be friendly, respectful, and keep the good vibes going.

This is a chill space to make friends, share ideas, and hang out, not a place for drama or forced agendas.

Most importantly, this is about building meaningful, long-term friendships — a place where people can grow together, achieve things, and support each other through all of life’s highs and lows.

4️⃣ How to Get Started

Introduce yourself in the comments or in the Discord/Telegram group (link in pinned comment or DM me for invite).

Share what kind of hangouts you’d enjoy, or any icebreaker ideas.

Once the group grows and everyone feels comfortable, we can start planning meetups and shared projects together.

Think of this as a solid community where we push each other to grow, celebrate achievements, support each other in difficult times, and create meaningful memories together.

Once again, thank you guys for the dedicated support. I could've never made this far without you guys & especially the other guy @Few_Lie2608 for posting his post about him creating his social crew that inspired me to just do it irregardless if I know I may have a high chance of failing. Thank you all and really I appreciate each and every one of you, this includes people that read my messages or even just dropping a comment under my post, & expressing that you want to be a part of our journey together🫵😊❤️",3,1759322515.0,ExtroIntrovertSG,0,1.0,False

I dreamt of the engagement party. The tables are covered in white linen, the crystal glasses clinking as Derek’s laughter carries across the room. Everyone is radiant, full of pride. Except him.

I remembered it vividly—even before I dreamt of it, it was one of those moments seared into me. He pulled me aside when nobody was looking, when Derek was shaking hands with my father.

His voice was low, but sharper than I’d ever heard it.

**“Jackie, listen to me. It’s not just him.”**

I blinked, confused. *Not just him?*

**“I’m not saying Derek is bad. That’s not what I mean. It’s… it’s everything that he brings with him. Everything that follows him.” His voice got low, measured. “…Its everything he wants. Everything he’s willing to sell himself, and you, out for.”**

I remembered laughing nervously, brushing it off like he was being dramatic. He always had that uncanny way of reading situations too deeply.

**“Grandpa, it’s just an engagement party. Don’t scare me.”**

He didn’t smile. His eyes were glassy, heavy with something unspoken.

**“Jackie… there are things you can’t undo once you’ve said ‘yes.’ You think you know what’s coming, but you don’t. Not with him. Not with all of…** ***that***\*\*.”\*\*

I remembered asking what “that” meant, but he just squeezed her hand and muttered, almost to himself:

“Hey babe! Get over here!” Derek shouted, flashing his brilliant grin across the room, and her grandfather slipped back into the crowd.

The clinking of glasses fades. The lights dim. Derek’s grin stretches, impossibly wide, his teeth too sharp, his voice echoing like it’s coming from inside a cave. Her girlfriends’ laughter warps into static. Her mother’s cheer curdles into something like sobbing.

Only my grandfather remains clear. Standing perfectly still while the rest of the room melts into shadows. His eyes meet mine one last time.

I woke up gasping, my throat dry, her body drenched in cold sweat. I heard Derek breathing peacefully beside me, utterly human, utterly normal. I glanced over at my alarm. It was 3am.

I didn’t go back to bed. I just got up, showered, and got ready for the day.

Later that day around lunch, my fork scraped along the side of my salad bowl as I glanced down the cafeteria. Oswald was sitting alone, tucked away at the very back, huddled over his Tupperware, and now he was reading Plato. His posture was tight, almost defensive, shoulders hunched as if the world itself were too bright.

He finished first, as always, and left without a word.

The moment he left the cafeteria, a hush fell across her table. Then—like sharks catching the scent of blood—they started.

“God, that guy is so… weird,” muttered Elise, stabbing her quinoa like it had personally wronged her.

I tilted my head, surprised at what I just heard. Weird. The way she said it hung harsh and heavy.

“Right?” chimed in Lauren, rolling her eyes. “He never talks to anyone. Just… sits there. Eating the same thing every day. It’s creepy.”

“Oh, please!” said Michelle. “He doesn’t *just* eat the same thing. He *watches* people. I swear to God, I can feel his eyes burning holes in the back of my head sometimes.”

That set the whole table off—snickers, laughter, a chorus of *groans with light chuckling.*

I kept my lips pressed together. I was shocked at the casual pettiness and cruelty being expressed by everyone at the table.

“He gives me the ick,” Elise continued, tossing her hair over her shoulder. “Like, why doesn’t he just… go work somewhere else? He clearly doesn’t fit in.”

“Oh, come on,” Michelle laughed, “the partners probably keep him around because he’ll do all the boring grunt work without complaining. Every firm needs a… what’s the word… a hermit?”

“No, no,” Lauren grinned, lowering her voice in a mock-whisper, “every firm needs a freak.”

More laughter.

Jackie pushed a crouton around her plate, saying nothing. The laughter felt brittle, too loud, like it was echoing inside her skull.

 

Later, in the women’s bathroom, the tone was completely different. Jackie was reapplying her lipstick when a cluster of her coworkers swarmed in—heels clicking, voices carrying like they were on a stage.

“Jackieee,” Elise cooed, clasping her hands together. “I still cannot get over how lucky you are. Derek is, like, *dreamboat central.*”

“Seriously,” Lauren agreed, fluffing her hair in the mirror. “It’s like something out of one of those epic romance novels. The hot, successful guy sweeping in and whisking you off your feet? Ugh, I’m living for it.”

“And that engagement party?” Michelle added, practically swooning. “It was *perfect.* Like… Pinterest board perfect. I was telling my mom about it, and she was like, ‘Is this girl a Kennedy or something?’”

They all laughed.

Jackie forced a smile at her reflection.

“It’s going to be the wedding of the year,” Elise declared, like it was a verdict from on high. “Fairytale vibes, Jackie. Absolute fairytale. We’re all so excited.”

“Epic,” Lauren said dreamily. “Straight out of a storybook. Prince Charming, glass slipper, the whole thing.”

Jackie’s lipstick trembled in her hand.

Marsha’s office was a glass box glowing with lamplight against the dimming city skyline. I stepped in, clutching my legal pad tighter than I meant to, already bracing myself for the inevitable.

She didn’t waste time. Partners never do.

“Jackie, close the door,” she said, her voice clipped, precise. She was scribbling something across a yellow pad, not even looking at me.

I obeyed.

Finally, she looked up, eyes sharp enough to cut glass. “You’re staying past five.”

I hesitated. “Tonight?”

“Yes, tonight. And tomorrow, and probably Friday if you want to keep your hours where they need to be.” She leaned back, steepling her fingers. “We’ve got a dozen filings—motions for summary judgment, deposition outlines, hearings prep. Half of them are due by *tonight*. Our clients don’t care that you have dinner plans.”

Her tone was matter-of-fact, the way only someone who’s lived inside a white-shoe firm for decades can deliver. She wasn’t yelling. She didn’t need to.

I swallowed. “Of course. I’ve been keeping my hours tight. Logged everything—”

“Good,” she interrupted, sharper now. “Because billables are the only currency that matters here. And Jackie—” she tilted her head, just slightly, “—don’t make the mistake of thinking you’re indispensable. You’re not. The firm is the bloodstream. We all just keep it pumping.”

It was the kind of line Harvey Specter might drop, casual but loaded. Only coming from Marsha, it didn’t sound slick. It sounded… clinical.

I nodded. “I understand.”

“Do you?” she asked. “Because too many young associates think this is law school with a paycheck. It’s not. We are in the trenches, and if you’re not willing to bleed hours, someone else will. That’s the way it works.”

Her words rattled around in my skull, louder than they should’ve. Normally, I’d take them, absorb them, keep moving. That’s what we all did. But this time something was different.

I glanced at the stack of folders on her desk. The same manila files, the same deadlines, the same endless churn. But when she slid one across to me, I noticed something. A faint scrawl on the corner of the cover—like a mark, almost carved into the cardboard.

It wasn’t pen. It wasn’t pencil. It looked burned.

I froze.

“Problem?” Marsha asked, her eyes narrowing.

“No,” I said quickly, tucking the file under my arm. But my heart was hammering.

“Good. Then get back to work. Don’t leave before nine.” She returned to her pad, already finished with me.

I turned and left, the weight of the file dragging my expensive pumps that were a gift from Derek.

In the hallway, the fluorescents flickered once, twice, then held steady. I could hear the hum of the office, the low drone of printers, the faint clack of keyboards from the paralegals still grinding. But something else pressed against me too—like the walls themselves were leaning closer, listening.

Nine o’clock. Another late night. Another set of hours swallowed into the abyss.

But as I walked back to my desk, I couldn’t shake the thought pulsing in my head.

What if those files weren’t just cases? What if that mark I saw wasn’t an accident?

And what if the basement I wasn’t supposed to know about… was where they all ended up?

 

By the time five o’clock rolled around, I had already resigned myself to the night. My takeout container was still steaming on the corner of my desk, unopened, while Derek’s call played on a loop in my head. He’d canceled dinner—again—this time with a cheerful excuse: *“Big partner stuff, babe. I’ll make it up to you.”*

Of course he would.

That’s when I saw Oswald. Heading for the elevators, quiet as always, his file stack tucked neatly under his arm.

“You heading out already?” I asked, half teasing.

He stopped, looked at me with that calm, oddly detached gaze. “Paralegals are required to leave at five.” His tone wasn’t apologetic. It was matter-of-fact, like he was quoting some rule carved in stone.

“Oh. Right.” I forced a smile. “Well, have a nice night.”

He gave a little wave, turned, and disappeared into the elevator.

My eyes lingered a little longer than I should’ve—his back, broad and impossibly straight, framed against the glow of the closing doors. Then he was gone, and the office swallowed me again.

By the time the sun finally slipped below the horizon, the place had changed. We were all still there—associates scattered across different rooms, too chained to our workloads to even think of leaving. Teams chat was our lifeline now, the occasional ping from someone buried three offices away reminding me that I wasn’t completely alone.

Marsha was still in her glass box, her silhouette lit by the cold glow of her monitor. I could hear the steady tapping of her keyboard whenever I paused long enough to notice.

Then it came.

A dull metallic *thunk.*

The sound drifted from the far side of the floor, toward the dumbwaiter.

I froze, pen in hand.

*Another delivery? At this hour?*

I walked over, footsteps muffled by the carpeted floor thank god, and sure enough—there it was. A fresh stack of documents resting in the little metal drawer.

There was a pitch-black folder like before on top. The slip read: **For Marsha Only.**

Of course.

I glanced toward her office. She was slumped over her desk, head tilted slightly, eyes closed. Asleep. I checked my watch: 8:24 p.m.

My chest tightened.

I’d finished most of my work. I had no reason—*no excuse*—to touch what wasn’t mine. But the weight of those files in the dumbwaiter… it was like they were humming. Like if I didn’t open them, they’d open themselves.

Every instinct I had screamed at me not to do this. It was the kind of feeling that came when you watched a horror movie and were yelling at the girl or the boy not to go down that corner or go through that door because you KNEW something was waiting on the other side.

I moved carefully, angling my body just so, mindful of the black dome of the security camera overhead. One smooth pivot, the file slid open beneath my hands.

And then my blood ran cold.

It was the same as before—shell companies. Obscure legal entities with bank accounts that traced cleanly, numbers and routing details that checked out on the firm’s system. Except these weren’t in places you could fly to. They weren’t even in places you could point to on a map.

**Coordinates listed in negative dimensions. Time stamps for deposits dated centuries in the future. Withdrawals from eras long past.**

One folder referenced “clients domiciled beyond standard jurisdiction of three-dimensional terrestrial space.”

I felt my stomach drop as my eyes combed further through the documents,

Mixed in with the corporate ledgers were notes—scrawled memos that didn’t read like lawyers at all. They spoke of *families*. Not metaphorical corporate families, but actual crime families. Mafia names I half-recognized from law school case studies, only… older. Too old. Names that should’ve died out a century ago.

And then the photo.

I wish I hadn’t seen it.

A glossy print, clipped to the back. A massive shipping crate, the kind you’d expect to see in a freighter yard. Metal, corroded, bolted shut.

And the size of it—easily big enough to hold a car. Or something alive.

I’d seen that kind of crate before, in movies. *Jurassic Park.* Velociraptors slamming against steel walls.

Only this wasn’t Hollywood.

There was no studio. No prop team. Just a black-and-white warehouse shot, timestamp blurred like someone didn’t want me knowing when it was taken.

I shut the file so fast the paper edges sliced my thumb.

A bead of blood welled up instantly, tiny but bright.

Behind me, in the silence of the empty office, the dumbwaiter *clanked* again.

Empty.

Like something had gone back down.

Or was waiting to come up.

I shouldn’t have checked the dumbwaiter again.  
But when I heard that second *clank*, something in me couldn’t help it.

This time it wasn’t a neat stack of manila folders. No, this was heavier, bulkier. A black accordion file, swollen at the seams, wrapped tight with a clasp that looked almost ceremonial. On top of it sat a lockbox—industrial gray, edges scuffed with age. The kind of thing you’d expect to find in a bank vault, not a law firm.

And stamped on the side, faint but undeniable, was a **seal.**  
Raised, wax-like, with a symbol I didn’t recognize. Geometric lines, concentric circles. The kind of thing that didn’t belong on legal paperwork. The kind of thing you might find in a secret society textbook or a forgotten church relic.

A wave of dread broke over me. Not the creeping, low-level kind I’d been battling all week. This was sharp, absolute. My body reacted before my brain caught up—sweat prickled my scalp, my throat tightened, my hands shook.

I didn’t dare open it. Not this time. Not with the cameras overhead, not with the weight of that seal staring at me.

So I did the only thing I could think of.

I carefully lifted the entire accordion file and the lockbox, forced my face into a blank, I’m-just-doing-my-job mask, and walked across the hall to Marsha’s office. She was still slumped at her desk, mouth slightly open, breathing the shallow rhythm of exhaustion.

I laid the file on her desk, gently, like I was placing a bomb.  
Then I backed away.

Back into view of the cameras. Back into the fluorescent wash of my own cubicle light. Back to the safety of pretending I hadn’t just brushed up against something I was never meant to see.

It was only 8:07 p.m. I had already completed everything on my docket, but leaving now wasn’t an option. If anyone asked why I was walking out early, if anyone thought to check where I’d been a few minutes before… I couldn’t risk it.

So I resigned myself to another night. Midnight, at least.  
Another missed gym session. Another sacrifice to the altar of Spitzer, Sullivan & Stern.

But what gnawed at me wasn’t the missed workout.  
It was the thought of the drive home, in my Mercedes, brain fogged with fatigue. I knew how dangerous I got behind the wheel at that hour.

Luckily, the firm provided taxis. For late nights, emergencies, the associates too broken to risk the highway.

By 11:58, I caved. I shut down my computer, grabbed my coat, and pressed the elevator button. The hum of the building changed as I descended. Quieter. Hollow.

The parking garage was almost empty when I stepped out. The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting everything in that washed-out, liminal glow that makes the world look more like a memory than reality.

The taxi was already waiting.

I opened the rear door and slid in. Immediately, I noticed it: a partition wall between me and the driver. Not plexiglass like a regular cab, but something harder. Metallic. Cold.

It felt like stepping into an armored convoy.

The driver didn’t turn, didn’t greet me. Just one low voice, flat and functional, slipped through a tiny slit in the partition.

“Destination?”

I gave him my address.

He didn’t reply. Didn’t acknowledge. The car started rolling forward, smooth and deliberate.

And I couldn’t stop thinking—  
Why all the security?

Who exactly was this car designed to protect?

Me?  
Or whoever was making sure I got home *without questions?*

I hit the mattress like a corpse. Didn’t even change out of my work clothes, didn’t even brush my teeth. Just collapsed.  
Five hours until the alarm. Five hours until I had to drag my over-caffeinated, underslept body back into that skyscraper, back into billing every last breath, every last swallow of burnt coffee.

And in that moment—God help me—I started wishing I’d flunked out of law school like Oswald.  
At least then I wouldn’t be *here.*

That’s when I heard it.

Muffled voices.

Through the door.

Derek.

At first, I tried to ignore it. He took calls late sometimes, and I didn’t want to know. I was too tired to care. But then—

“Yeah, the tranche clears next month… once it’s laundered through the offshore feeders.”

My eyes shot open.

I sat up. Listened harder. The words bled through the thin crack of the door like poison.

“No, Cayman’s too hot. We’re cycling this one through the Dutch sandwiches—shells in the Antilles, then rerouted to the Zurich custodials. After that, it’s ghosted through Tier-2 intermediaries. By the time Treasury blinks, the paper trail’s dust.”

I pressed my bare feet to the carpet and crept toward the door.

Peeking through the peephole, I saw him. Derek. Still in his suit, tie loosened, pacing the hall with his phone to his ear. Calm. Confident.

“Yeah, I know FATF is tightening, but trust me, they’ll never pierce it. Not with the way Spitzer’s people structured the trusts. Legitimate on the surface, encrypted underneath. It’s watertight.”

*Spitzer’s people.*  
My blood ran cold.

He chuckled low into the receiver, voice like oil.

“Exactly. The feds can subpoena Wells all day, it won’t matter. The books bifurcate—what they see, and what *we* see. Clean as daylight on one side, black as hell on the other.”

Pause. A shift in his tone.

“Of course the Families are satisfied. Why wouldn’t they be? We’ve doubled their ROI since Q2. And when the Sicilians and the Russians are on the same ledger without killing each other, you don’t ask questions—you just keep the wires humming.”

The Families.  
My chest tightened.

He stopped pacing, lowered his voice, but I still caught fragments—

“Yeah, Delgado’s firm. They’ve got the infrastructure. Cross-border, multi-jurisdictional filings, everything ironclad. They make it all look *boring as hell,* which is exactly why it works.”

That was me. My firm, Spitzer, Sullivan and Stern. Marsha’s work.  
I stumbled back from the door like I’d been slapped.

Derek’s laugh followed, sharp and satisfied.

“Don’t worry. She doesn’t know. She’ll never know.”

I barely made it to the bed before I heard the key in the lock. I dove under the covers, heart jackhammering, forcing my breathing into slow, sleepy rhythm.

The door opened. His shoes clicked across the hardwood. The mattress dipped as he sat beside me.

His hand brushed my hair.

“Long day, huh?” he whispered. His voice was honey again. Normal. Safe.

I didn’t move. Didn’t answer. Just lay there, pretending to be asleep, every nerve in my body screaming.

Because now I knew.

Derek’s firm wasn’t just finance.  
It was a *front.*  
And worse—somehow, some way—it was tied to *my firm too.*

I didn’t want to move. Didn’t want to face the day. My body ached from yesterday, from the weight of all of it. But I knew I couldn’t. Not after everything that happened last night.

I didn’t shower. Didn’t change. Just shoved on my heels, tore open the bread, threw some slices in the toaster, grabbed them, and bolted. The subway would have to do today.

The firm’s cab service called, cheerfully offering the expressway route. I almost said yes—almost—but then I remembered the last ride. The windows I couldn’t see through, the driver I couldn’t see at all. No, the subway was safer. Safer and honest.

By the time I reached the office, Marsha was already there, perched behind her massive desk like a hawk. She didn’t even look up from her computer when I walked in.

“Jackie,” she said, finally, “I need you to start billing for these additional matters immediately. Some depositions, a couple of motions, and the draft for a summary judgment. We need these tonight.”

I nodded. “Yes, Marsha.”

A big, goofy, obedient smile plastered to my face. I even waved my hand a little, the way you do when a client says something absurd but you can’t actually laugh at it.

Inside, though…

I wanted to rip her head off.

I wanted to scream. I wanted to throw the phone across the room and watch the world explode. I’ve been doing billable hours for **two straight months**, and the workload is relentless. No break, no reprieve. And now she wants more?

I screamed every curse word in my head, each one more violent than the last. The F-bombs ricocheted in my skull. Every insult, every imaginable threat, hurled at her without a single sound leaving my lips.

But on the outside…

Nothing. Just the friendly, bright, *please-don’t-hate-me* grin.

“Yes, Marsha,” I repeated, soft and cheerful.

Marsha nodded and turned back to her screen. Her presence was like a weight, suffocating but oddly hollow. I wanted to tell her everything I saw, everything I found last night—the shell companies, the crates, the accounts that didn’t exist. But I couldn’t. Not yet.

Instead, I sank into my chair, opened ProLaw, and started billing. I could feel every nerve in my body humming with rage.

I hadn’t slept. Not really. Not since… God, I couldn’t even remember. And I hadn’t moved. Not one run. Not one weight. Hell, not even a walk. Months. Months of sitting at a desk, staring at screens, punching numbers into billable hours, while my body quietly screamed in revolt.

This law job. This *soul-crushing, blood-sucking, daylight-stealing nightmare* they called corporate law. I’d have taken an accident on the freeway any day. An eighteen-wheeler smashing into my car wouldn’t have demanded billable hours. Not the paramedics, not the insurance company, not the fucking IRS. Nothing could be *this cruel* naturally.

And then there was Derek. My fiancé. The man everyone adored. The golden boy. Charming, flawless, six-foot-three of sheer charisma and charisma alone. Everyone loved him. Everyone. And now I knew why.

He was a goddamn walking front for the Mafia. Every other crime family in the region. And me? I had willingly tied myself to him. Bought the lie, believed in it. Sat in law school, worked my ass off, scored every top grade, all while he *played the golden-boy angel for the world*—all to fund his rotten deals.

And for what? Why did I even start on this miserable path? Why go to law school at all when starving artists, poets, drifters, didn’t have to log *every fucking minute* of their existence to a ledger that would ultimately betray them? Why?

And the sorority. My “sisters.” God, I hated that fucking sorority. A glorified hazing cult wrapped in pastel ribbons and weekend retreats. And yet we all bought it. I bought it. And Derek? He didn’t need to lift a finger. Just smiled that perfect, stupid grin, and they all fell over themselves. Even me. I was stupid enough to be charmed. I had been *played*.

And the one person who could have seen this—my grandfather—he had. Always had. He had seen it all before anyone else did. He had warned me. He had *warned me about the world*, about the kinds of men who wear charm like armor.

About the things they bring with them, the shadows trailing them like smoke. And then he fucking died. Days before I graduated. He didn’t live to see what came next. And now I was here. Alone.

But then I stumbled onto something deadly serious. Something that made my chest tighten, my stomach knot, my mind spiral. I knew too much. I had seen the shell corporations that didn’t exist in any dimension, the bank accounts that weren’t on any ledger yet traced to real-world banks, the crates, the photos, the files that smelled of something old, corrupt, *primordial*.

And I knew. I couldn’t leave. Not now. Not ever. Not while all this was moving like a slow, inevitable tide around me.

Because if I left… if I walked away… I would vanish. Just like those accounts. Just like those files. Just like… Oswald whispered in my dream:

*Secure. Contain. Protect.*

And suddenly I realized: this wasn’t a game. This wasn’t a law firm. It wasn’t a job, not even Derek. This was something far, far worse. And I was in it. Whether I liked it or not.

I clenched my fists. My teeth. My heart pounded so loud I was sure Marsha in the office down the hall could hear it.

I wasn’t leaving.

I couldn’t.

Because the moment I did… I wouldn’t just lose my job. I wouldn’t just lose Derek, or my sanity, or my life as I knew it. I’d vanish. And something else… something darker… would step into the space I left behind.

And that… that was not an option.

I was halfway through another billing spreadsheet when my phone buzzed. *Marsha*.

“Jackie,” she said, her tone syrupy, “could you come to the conference room? The partners want to see you.”

My stomach dropped. My pulse quickened. The day had been dragging for hours, my mind looping over every shell corporation, every impossible account, every crate photograph. I’d been thinking about leaving. *Walking out*. Slamming the elevator doors on this tower of lies and not looking back.

I wanted out.

I wanted to run.

And then I walked into the conference room.

Three managing partners were there, sitting like statues at the long, polished mahogany table. Their smiles were too sharp, too deliberate, too rehearsed. Marsha stood aside, hands folded, a silent sentinel.

“Jackie,” the first partner said, voice smooth, almost velvet. “We wanted to congratulate you. Truly. Your performance these past few months has been exemplary.”

I nodded, my throat tight. “Thank you.”

“Not just that,” the second partner said, leaning back, hands steepled. “We hear you’re engaged. That wedding is coming up soon, isn’t it?”

I swallowed. “Yes. Next month.”

A slow smirk spread across the third partner’s face. “A happy occasion. Your fiancé must be very proud.”

I forced a polite smile. “He is.”

There was a pause. And then they leaned forward slightly, almost imperceptibly. Their words didn’t need to carry a threat. Their eyes did the work.

“For the sake of your family,” the first partner said casually, “and, of course, your fiancé… it would be prudent not to leave Spitzer, Sullivan & Stern. Your continued presence here is… beneficial.”

The words were soft, almost polite. But they weren’t an invitation. They were a warning.

I could feel my pulse in my temples, my hands tightening into fists I forced to rest in my lap. I wanted to scream, to demand answers, to rip the veneer off this polished hellhole and see the rot underneath.

Instead, I nodded again. “Of course. I understand.”

Marsha gave me a small, approving nod, almost imperceptible. I could hear the faint click of the door as it closed behind me, sealing me in the silent corridor.

And I realized something chilling.

They didn’t have to say it. They didn’t need to spell out what would happen if I left.

When the knock came at my office door, I assumed it was Dawes again, or maybe Daniela with another sarcastic remark about how many hours I’d been logging.

Instead, a tall figure stepped in, files balanced neatly in his arms. He was 5’11, lean but muscular, the kind of build you get from strict discipline rather than vanity. He wore black pants, brown loafers, a long-sleeved button-down white shirt, and a red tie. His expression was calm, almost flat.

“Oh, hi,” I said, rising quickly, smoothing the skirt of my suit. “Jackie Delgado. Nice to meet you. I wasn’t expecting a summer associate already.”

The man set the files gently on my desk and extended his hand. “I’m not a summer associate, Ms. Delgado. I’m your legal assistant. My name’s Oswald.”

I froze for half a beat, his name knocking something loose in my memory.

Then it hit me.

“Oswald?” I repeated, my voice softer than I intended. “From FIU?”

For the first time, a faint smile touched his lips. “Yeah. We had a few classes together, if I remember right. You were on the volleyball team.”

A blush crept up my neck. “Right. Of course. It’s just—” I shook my head, fumbling. “I thought you’d gone to law school. I assumed you’d be… well, an associate.”

His smile vanished. His tone stayed even, but his words landed sharp. “I started law school. Didn’t last. Flunked out first semester.”

I blinked, surprised. “Oh, I didn’t know. I thought you—”

“I took the LSAT three times. Got a 150 on my third attempt. Went to an unranked school.” He then lightly scoffed. “Guess I wasn’t built for it.”

I felt my heart sink slightly in my chest. I remembered Derek’s 172 score, his charisma, and the way everyone loved him even when he didn’t try. And now here was Oswald—someone I remembered sweating over prep books, who I was peer mentor to when it came to the law. When I was finishing, he was just starting out.

Physically? Oswald was my type. More so than Derek. But Derek I guess was better connected to me and my social circles than Oswald was.  

***I wish I learned before that wedding that just because you are better connected for someone, doesn’t mean you are right for them.***

“Oh,” I managed, forcing a smile that felt too tight. “Well… it’s good to see you again, Oswald. And thank you for the help. Really. I appreciate it.”

He inclined his head, precise as his movements. “Ms. Dawes thought I could be of use to you. I’ll handle whatever you need. Just let me know.”

With that, he turned and left, silent as a shadow.

Later that day, in the associates’ lounge, I grabbed a quick coffee before diving back into my mountain of files.

“Hey, Jackie.”

I looked up to see David Chen, one of the second-year associates. He leaned against the counter while his coffee brewed, tie loosened just enough to say *casual, but not sloppy.*

“Hey, David. How’s it going?” I asked, stirring cream into my cup.

He smirked. “Long week. Always is. You?”

“Pretty good. Still trying to find my way around,” I then let off a light smile, “My new assistant, Oswald—he’s incredibly helpful!” I chirped.

David raised his eyebrows. “Oswald? Yeah he’s … intense.”

“What do you mean?” I asked, curious.

David tapped the edge of the counter with his knuckle. “Works like a machine. Files are always in order, never a mistake. You’ll never see him complain. But he’s… well lets face it he’s a little off.”

I laughed lightly, though the sound felt out of place. “I thought he was a summer associate at first. I almost embarrassed myself.”

“You wouldn’t be the first,” David said. “He carries himself like one, but trust me—he isn’t. He’s just… here. Always here.”

I frowned. “How long has he been working for the firm?”

David shrugged, grabbing his cup. “Couple weeks, maybe a month. Hard to say. He just showed up one day and Dawes put him on someone’s desk. Guess now it’s yours.”

I nodded, silently sipping my coffee to hide my unease.

David gave me a quick grin. “Don’t overthink it. If he makes your life easier, just roll with it. Plenty of us would kill for an assistant like him.”

I nodded, finishing my coffee.

But as I went back to my office, I couldn’t shake the memory of Oswald back at FIU. We took some of the same classes despite him being a year behind me. We both went to the same gym too, the same gym Derek not long after graduating, stopped going to. But I passed my LSAT on the very first try while he failed one conditional acceptance program and retook the LSAT three times

And now he was here. Not as a fellow associate, but as a legal assistant. My legal assistant. As if law school had never happened at all.

The first time I noticed something off, I told myself it was nothing.

That morning, I had blocked off two hours to work through some files Dawes had left on my desk—mostly dull commercial disputes and one real oddity: an account full of encrypted numbers that didn’t match any system I knew, let alone the federal banking codes we’d been trained to recognize. I’d flagged it in my notes, planning to dig in deeper after lunch.

But when I came back from a meeting, the file was gone. Not misplaced, not shoved under a stack of contracts—just *gone.*

At first I thought Oswald had moved it. He had that unnerving precision about him, the kind of efficiency that made you feel like he could anticipate your needs before you voiced them.

I buzzed his desk.

“Oswald? Did you move a file off my desk? The Williamson account?”

He paused for a second. His voice came back low, even. “No, Ms. Delgado. I haven’t touched anything.”

I sat there staring at the empty spot on my desk, convinced for a few minutes that maybe I had misremembered. Regardless I wasn’t going to fly off the handle over one missing file on my second week.

By the time noon rolled around, I told myself it didn’t matter. I shoved the thought away, grabbed my bag, and joined the others for lunch.

The cafeteria at Spitzer, Sullivan & Stern wasn’t what you’d expect from a law firm. It wasn’t some dark break room with a rattling vending machine. No, this was a bright, airy space on the tenth floor, glass walls stretching high above Brickell Avenue, sunlight flooding the room so warm and golden it almost erased the fatigue in everyone’s faces.

It buzzed with energy—paralegals gossiping in rapid Spanish, partners holding hushed side conversations, junior associates decompressing for thirty blessed minutes before diving back into the fire.

I went through the buffet line, picked up a salad and soup, then spotted Marsha Dawes sitting with a cluster of associates and a junior partner I recognized.

“Hey, everyone. Mind if I join?” I asked, balancing my tray.

“Jackie!” Sarah Miller, a third-year associate with a perpetual air of friendliness, waved me over. Marsha just gave me her subtle nod of approval.

The group was mid-debate over a Wall Street Journal article on some massive merger, their voices tumbling over one another with that strange blend of casual confidence and razor-sharp competitiveness.

“So, Jackie,” Henderson—the junior partner, sharp-eyed, dry wit—leaned back in his chair. “How’s your first few weeks?”

“It’s been intense,” I said, flashing a grin. “But I’m learning a lot. Everyone’s been really helpful.”

“Good,” he said, biting into his sandwich. “Don’t hesitate to ask questions. Even the dumb ones. We’ve all been there.” He winked, drawing laughter.

I laughed too, but my eyes wandered across the cafeteria.

In the far corner, away from the chatter and the windows, Oswald was sitting alone.

He was hunched over a massive hardbound book, not a novel or a casebook but something denser. Finance. His brow furrowed, eyes moving silently up and down the page.

Sarah followed my gaze. “Oh, that’s your assistant, right? Oswald?”

“Yeah.” I nodded, forcing casualness into my tone. “He’s… very focused. I don’t think I’ve seen him take a real break yet.”

Ben, another associate at the table, chuckled. “Doesn’t talk much. Keeps to himself. But the guy’s efficient as hell. Like scary efficient. Gets things done before you even finish asking.”

I nodded. “Yeah. I’ve noticed that.”

“He’s got his routines,” Sarah said, picking at her salad. “Always sits at that table. Always reading something dense. Last week it was a paperback fantasy. Now it’s finance.”

Henderson leaned in. “Bright kid. Quiet. A little weird, but sharp. He’s an excellent assistant!” He gave me a small grin, correcting himself: “You’re …” he hesitated. “…Good to have him.”

“Definitely,” I said, though my eyes lingered on Oswald longer than I meant them to. There was a quiet intensity to his demeanor. Almost like he had a second sight that knew, or otherwise sensed things that the others did not.

And the worst part was that I felt it too.

“Does he… ever join you guys?” I asked quietly.

The group exchanged glances.

“Never seen him sit with anyone,” Ben said. “Always eats alone. And quick too.”

Sarah hesitated, her tone softening. “After, you know… law school not working out… I think he keeps to himself. Probably doesn’t want to deal with the chatter.”

I nodded slowly, pretending that made perfect sense. But my thoughts snagged, circling back to the missing file on my desk, the one that vanished without explanation. For a moment, I wondered if Oswald had done it. If he’d taken it. If his obsessive studying and his silence were covering for something else entirely.

But then Henderson cracked a joke about the merger, the table erupted in laughter, and I forced myself to smile along. By the time I glanced back at the corner, Oswald was gone.

And the thought hit me like a whisper I didn’t want to hear.

***Oswald and I knew the same thing.***

After lunch, I went back upstairs and logged into ProLaw. Only I logged into various other systems too and pulled up the documents from earlier.

Only, they weren’t there.

The leasing agreements, the land permit memos, and the odd client files that I saw earlier didn’t show up on Google, LexisNexis, or Westlaw. They were completely gone. In their place were the sort of cases every first-year associate would kill for: Carnival Cruise Lines. UM Health. Florida Power & Light. The type of files you could point to and say, *yes, this is real work for real clients*.

I sat there for a moment, staring at the monitor, scrolling through the case list like maybe I’d missed something. But no—it was scrubbed clean. All buttoned-up and normal.

Marsha sent me a teams message.

“Please prepare a leasing memo for the new Carnival ship. I’ll need it by end of week.”

“Yes Ms. Dawes.” I replied back.

I opened the firm’s memo template and filled in the headers. I started typing boilerplate language about maritime leasing provisions and Florida statutory requirements. My fingers moved automatically, but my eyes flicked, every few minutes, back to the ProLaw screen.

That’s when Oswald walked in. No knock, just a soft shuffle of his shoes against the carpet. He had a file in his hand.

“I found it, Ms. Delgado,” he said with a flat tone as he placed the file on her desk.

The label was typed neatly across the tab. Nothing unusual. But the second his hand left the manila cover, I noticed the faintest indentation of something written beneath the type, as though another title had been erased—or maybe overwritten.

I smiled politely, corporate, professional. “Thanks, Oswald.”

He nodded, but lingered for a second too long before stepping back out of my office.

The folder Oswald had brought sat on my desk was neat, unassuming, and colored all black. I opened it slowly, first with curiosity, and slowly with creeping, uncanny dread.

Inside were reports and company manifests, all formatted perfectly—company letterheads, contact information, corporate numbers. Only, none of these companies existed. Not one. At least, not outside the pages of the folder.

Yet the firm’s system said otherwise. I typed in each company name, traced the account numbers, cross-referenced the Wells Fargo main branch codes listed. They all checked out. Everything was real. Everything *was there*.

I stared at the folder for what felt like an eternity, a chill crawling up my spine despite the warm office air. I carefully parsed the documents for metadata, hidden footnotes, for anything that could explain how a company could *exist and not exist at the same time*. But I would need access to the encrypted files and Marsha had the password. I didn’t.

Frustrated, I dialed the Wells Fargo branch number listed in the folder.

“This is Jackie Delgado, associate at Spitzer, Sullivan & Stern. I’m calling about these corporate accounts.”

A polite but firm voice answered. “I’m sorry, Ms. Delgado. We can only speak to the account holder on file—Ms. Dawes.”

I pressed, “I understand, but I have documents that reference these accounts, and I need verification.”

“I’m afraid I really can’t,” the teller repeated. “Please have Ms. Dawes call us.”

I hung up, my pulse quickening. The files on my desk suddenly felt heavier, like they carried their own weight. And then, as if on cue, the office door clicked open.

“Jackie,” Marsha’s voice called, crisp but warm, “how’s your day going?”

I snapped my attention back to the computer, clicking rapidly to close the folder Oswald had delivered, stashing the folder in my desk. The files for Carnival Cruises and UM Health remained open, normal, innocuous.

“Good,” I said evenly, forcing my tone to sound casual. “Just finishing up the leasing memo you sent.”

Marsha stepped fully into the doorway, arms crossed, scanning the room briefly before settling her gaze on me. “Everything running smoothly? Don’t hesitate to ask if you need anything.”

“Understood Ms. Dawes.” I replied, keeping my voice light, professional.

She nodded once, sharp and decisive, then turned to leave. As the door shut behind her, I exhaled slowly. My eyes drifted back to the pitch black folder. The one Oswald had brought. I shoved it into the side drawer, pressing it flat against the bottom where it wouldn’t be seen. Sitting back, I stared at it as the folder’s edge poked out of its hiding spot.

Should I tell her?

The thought looped in my mind. If I did, would she laugh it off, chalk it up to a system glitch, or would she see what I saw? I shook my head, forcing focus. Better to act normal. For now.

The files that didn’t exist were still there, somewhere, waiting. I didn’t know if anyone else could see them—or if they were meant to be seen at all.

And that thought made me shiver.

I went back to my desk, trying to shake off the earlier unease, but the file Oswald had delivered earlier kept gnawing at the back of my mind. The folder was locked—restricted, password-protected—and I couldn’t scan it for hidden details.

I gave into temptation, took the folder from its hiding place…And then I froze.

The name on the first page made my stomach twist like icy knives. It was Derek’s company. The one where my fiancé worked. My hand hovered over the tab, reluctant, trembling slightly.

I opened the folder, my eyes scanning for anything I could make sense of. The original documents seemed normal enough—company formation paperwork, investment summaries.

But as I flipped through, I realized the ledger wasn’t just for their legitimate accounts. Somehow, through a labyrinth of encrypted entries and impossible numbers, the books included both the real operations *and*… something else. Something I couldn’t fully trace.

I swallowed, my throat tight. A cold knot settled in my gut.

I left my desk, the polished floors of the associates’ wing echoing softly beneath my heels. Oswald was in the mail room, flipping through a stack of envelopes with his usual quiet focus.

I glanced at the black folder in my hands and slowly walked towards him. He looked up as I got closer.

Before I could open my mouth to say a word, another paralegal with a sharp, quick step, intercepted me, and the file was suddenly in another set of hands. Renata, one of the senior paralegals, stood before me. Her squint made her eyes look sharp and predatory. Her gaze locked onto me.

“Where did you get this?” she asked, her voice calm but firm, every word measured.

“It… Oswald brought it.” I forced out. “I was just—”

Renata cut me off with a small shake of her head. “No, Ms. Delgado. This is Marsha’s case. Her clients. You shouldn’t have it.”

I opened my mouth to argue, but she didn’t give me the chance. She took the folder from my hands, flipped the folder closed and tucked it under her arm. Her squint deepened. Before I could react, she walked over to the dumbwaiter mounted in the wall of the mail room, opened it, and slid the folder inside. The small metal door clanged shut.

“Where is that going?” I asked, my voice shaking slightly.

“The basement level.” she replied, eyes not meeting mine.

I blinked. “The… basement?” My mind was scrambling. “This building has a basement?”

She nodded, lips pressed tight. “Only the partners can go down there.”

I felt my pulse spike. My stomach turned over, a low, crawling chill crawling up my spine.

“I… I don’t understand,” I stammered. “Why would Marsha’s clients’ files go there?”

Renata gave me a small, tight-lipped smile. “Some things aren’t meant for associates. You’ll learn, Jackie.”

Her words should have reassured me. They didn’t. The clanging of the dumbwaiter door seemed louder than it had any right to be, echoing in the mail room long after she’d gone. I stayed rooted to the spot, staring at the metal hatch, imagining the folder descending into darkness.

I could feel it—some part of the firm I hadn’t been allowed to see, some shadow that operated behind the polished marble and sunlight-filled offices. And at the center of it, my fiancé’s company name… staring back at me from that folder, a cold, impossible knot of truth and unknown.

I wanted to know more, to demand answers, but even the thought of the basement made my skin crawl. Only partners could go down there and I was just an associate. And yet, I couldn’t shake the sense that the folder—and everything in it—had secrets waiting for me, watching, just below my feet.

That evening, I went home after another late night of logging billable hours at the firm. I barely switched out of my pencil skirt, collared shirt and blazer and into sweats and a t shirt before I collapsed into bed. I tried to put it behind me

But between the things I kept seeing and reading in files, and the long nightly hours, I couldn’t sleep. I could barely stay awake without slurping down four or five cups of coffee.

The next morning, I overslept. Good thing I didn’t change out of my clothes as I barely caught the metro in time. I didn’t go to my desk, not right away. Instead I went to the bathroom in an attempt to collect myself.

I then recognized the hard, steady clacking of shoes on tile from just outside my stall. They didnt sound like they were being made by cheap pumps purchased at JC Penny or Kohls. No, these sounded expensive, like the designer heels from Gucci and Neiman Marcus only affordable by the partners. The clicking of their heels against hard tile were low, measured, and conspiratorial.

I pulled my legs up so my flats couldn’t be seen under the door.

“Two associates gone. Tried to quit. Said they’d been talking to that agency again. The one that… secures, contains, protects.”

That had woken me up as they continued.

“Idiots.” The man said. “They thought they could dig into encrypted files and just… walk away? No one just walks away.”

The other woman gave a short laugh. “Poof. Gone. And good riddance.”

My heart sank and my blood ran cold.

Then the woman’s tone sharpened. “It was about that same file. The one floating around last week. The one that should’ve been sealed.”

My stomach dropped. They were talking about *my* file. The one Oswald had slipped me.

The man sighed. “That file should’ve never left the basement. If it shows up again, we’ll have bigger problems than a couple of missing associates, especially if the insurgency figures we can’t deliver.”

They washed their hands, heels clicking away.

I was frozen, heart hammering, legs trembling in the air. I could still hear Derek’s voice from last night: *Billions. Partner. Global wedding.*

And now all I could think was: *What did he sign his soul away for?*

That night, I dreamt of grandpa.

Not the frail man I last saw in the hospital bed, with tubes in his nose and monitors chirping like mechanical birds. This time he was much younger. Standing tall, clear-eyed, wearing that same tweed jacket he wore whenever he took a walk or went about town. The same jacket my mother always teased him about, saying it looked “twenty years out of season.”

But looking back on it now? I would do anything to see him in that jacket again.",1,1759321977.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

I (36,F)just had a weird, at least for me an experience with a guy(33,M) I started to really like and even though it looks like it ended, I want to understand better. Sorry for the long post already.

We met on a dating app around 1.5 months ago and it was all chemistry and sparks through the texts and phone calls. He did chase really hard, asked me out and also said how nervous he had been all the time. He has a history of drug and alchol addiction and has been sober for 2.5 years. Also he was out of the country and came back just this summer. He has a physical job, a family and the last time we spoke he was living in his mom s house but just rented his own place and about to move out. He has 2 friends.  Anyways the first date went perfect, we ended up spending 5 hours. He held my hand and also kissed me at the end while saying how he wants to see me again. After the date we kept on texting and calling. We said we really like each other and want to go on a second date asap.

Well, after that things started to change a bit. When the date of 2nd date approached I asked him if he wants to do anything particular for the date. He said his family is visitng and cannot meet me. I was like okay, fine. Then the day before the supposed date he called and asked if he can come over and have a sleep over. I said well I dont schedule sex on 2nd dates and said we should know each other a bit more outaide of my house first. He took it well at the moment and said he accepts it and told me he is struggling to accept someone like me being so nice to him. Because he thinks he is unlovable and undeserving in the end. He said he is trying to adjust and gave me a bit of self deprication. Well i briefly assured I dont see him as he described in his self deprication and I am excited to see him and date him...

Come to the day of the date, lo and behold he texted on the day saying he cannot make it. No reschedule, no another time asking. Yet he kept on texting. A few days later i asked him what does he want and he said he really doesnt know what he wants. He wants to be friends first and see how things go... some back and forth and i accepted it. 

He kept texting and calling (30min at least) everyday almost for a month. Except weekends. And he always called me while driving to work as his mom s house is too crowded to talk to me, i guess. Even we are ""friends"",  I always left confused as there was here and there flirting energy as well. Yet over this month he again refused to see me for a coffee, even though he was driving through my neighborhood. He kept finding excuses like how tired he is and how unfun he is. Last time I asked him again and said ""look we met more than a month ago, i like talking on the phone but dont you wanna hang out?"". Gosh, he refused in panic and said he needs to pack his clothes to get ready to move to new place.. after this lame excuse i stopped talking. Later on when he texted to ask me what s happening, I told him i dont understand if he talks to me this much but cannot meet me for 30 min for a coffee... This time he came with another reasoning that he is overstimulated at home and at such a crowded place. He cannot find any peace and how anti social he is to go out. He made jokes, deflected the topic a lot and asked me to give him some time... an indefinite one though. I said i understand him.

Anyway conversation ended there that night but next day he asked me again if i have anything to say. I said no, i asked questions last time like what does he want. If he wanna say anything he can tell me. God then he snapped at me?? I really dont understand why. He said ""i dont fuvking know anymore what else do you want from me, i can explain in 50 languages but if nobody listens i cant do anything. If you wanna stay then stay if you wanna go i wont blame you"". Well, i felt bad, maybe i shouldnt have and should have called out the disrespect, but i just said i heard you and i will stay. After this message of mine it has been days and it s complete slience... he didnt acknowledge or said anyrhing else

I think this was the end of our connection.  I really liked him and wanna understand better. What the heck was that? Any input from you guys are welcome.",8,1759321773.0,AskWomenOver30,58,0.75,False

I dreamt of the engagement party. The tables are covered in white linen, the crystal glasses clinking as Derek’s laughter carries across the room. Everyone is radiant, full of pride. Except him.

I remembered it vividly—even before I dreamt of it, it was one of those moments seared into me. He pulled me aside when nobody was looking, when Derek was shaking hands with my father.

His voice was low, but sharper than I’d ever heard it.

**“Jackie, listen to me. It’s not just him.”**

I blinked, confused. *Not just him?*

**“I’m not saying Derek is bad. That’s not what I mean. It’s… it’s everything that he brings with him. Everything that follows him.” His voice got low, measured. “…Its everything he wants. Everything he’s willing to sell himself, and you, out for.”**

I remembered laughing nervously, brushing it off like he was being dramatic. He always had that uncanny way of reading situations too deeply.

**“Grandpa, it’s just an engagement party. Don’t scare me.”**

He didn’t smile. His eyes were glassy, heavy with something unspoken.

**“Jackie… there are things you can’t undo once you’ve said ‘yes.’ You think you know what’s coming, but you don’t. Not with him. Not with all of…** ***that***\*\*.”\*\*

I remembered asking what “that” meant, but he just squeezed her hand and muttered, almost to himself:

“Hey babe! Get over here!” Derek shouted, flashing his brilliant grin across the room, and her grandfather slipped back into the crowd.

The clinking of glasses fades. The lights dim. Derek’s grin stretches, impossibly wide, his teeth too sharp, his voice echoing like it’s coming from inside a cave. Her girlfriends’ laughter warps into static. Her mother’s cheer curdles into something like sobbing.

Only my grandfather remains clear. Standing perfectly still while the rest of the room melts into shadows. His eyes meet mine one last time.

I woke up gasping, my throat dry, her body drenched in cold sweat. I heard Derek breathing peacefully beside me, utterly human, utterly normal. I glanced over at my alarm. It was 3am.

I didn’t go back to bed. I just got up, showered, and got ready for the day.

Later that day around lunch, my fork scraped along the side of my salad bowl as I glanced down the cafeteria. Oswald was sitting alone, tucked away at the very back, huddled over his Tupperware, and now he was reading Plato. His posture was tight, almost defensive, shoulders hunched as if the world itself were too bright.

He finished first, as always, and left without a word.

The moment he left the cafeteria, a hush fell across her table. Then—like sharks catching the scent of blood—they started.

“God, that guy is so… weird,” muttered Elise, stabbing her quinoa like it had personally wronged her.

I tilted my head, surprised at what I just heard. Weird. The way she said it hung harsh and heavy.

“Right?” chimed in Lauren, rolling her eyes. “He never talks to anyone. Just… sits there. Eating the same thing every day. It’s creepy.”

“Oh, please!” said Michelle. “He doesn’t *just* eat the same thing. He *watches* people. I swear to God, I can feel his eyes burning holes in the back of my head sometimes.”

That set the whole table off—snickers, laughter, a chorus of *groans with light chuckling.*

I kept my lips pressed together. I was shocked at the casual pettiness and cruelty being expressed by everyone at the table.

“He gives me the ick,” Elise continued, tossing her hair over her shoulder. “Like, why doesn’t he just… go work somewhere else? He clearly doesn’t fit in.”

“Oh, come on,” Michelle laughed, “the partners probably keep him around because he’ll do all the boring grunt work without complaining. Every firm needs a… what’s the word… a hermit?”

“No, no,” Lauren grinned, lowering her voice in a mock-whisper, “every firm needs a freak.”

More laughter.

Jackie pushed a crouton around her plate, saying nothing. The laughter felt brittle, too loud, like it was echoing inside her skull.

 

Later, in the women’s bathroom, the tone was completely different. Jackie was reapplying her lipstick when a cluster of her coworkers swarmed in—heels clicking, voices carrying like they were on a stage.

“Jackieee,” Elise cooed, clasping her hands together. “I still cannot get over how lucky you are. Derek is, like, *dreamboat central.*”

“Seriously,” Lauren agreed, fluffing her hair in the mirror. “It’s like something out of one of those epic romance novels. The hot, successful guy sweeping in and whisking you off your feet? Ugh, I’m living for it.”

“And that engagement party?” Michelle added, practically swooning. “It was *perfect.* Like… Pinterest board perfect. I was telling my mom about it, and she was like, ‘Is this girl a Kennedy or something?’”

They all laughed.

Jackie forced a smile at her reflection.

“It’s going to be the wedding of the year,” Elise declared, like it was a verdict from on high. “Fairytale vibes, Jackie. Absolute fairytale. We’re all so excited.”

“Epic,” Lauren said dreamily. “Straight out of a storybook. Prince Charming, glass slipper, the whole thing.”

Jackie’s lipstick trembled in her hand.

Marsha’s office was a glass box glowing with lamplight against the dimming city skyline. I stepped in, clutching my legal pad tighter than I meant to, already bracing myself for the inevitable.

She didn’t waste time. Partners never do.

“Jackie, close the door,” she said, her voice clipped, precise. She was scribbling something across a yellow pad, not even looking at me.

I obeyed.

Finally, she looked up, eyes sharp enough to cut glass. “You’re staying past five.”

I hesitated. “Tonight?”

“Yes, tonight. And tomorrow, and probably Friday if you want to keep your hours where they need to be.” She leaned back, steepling her fingers. “We’ve got a dozen filings—motions for summary judgment, deposition outlines, hearings prep. Half of them are due by *tonight*. Our clients don’t care that you have dinner plans.”

Her tone was matter-of-fact, the way only someone who’s lived inside a white-shoe firm for decades can deliver. She wasn’t yelling. She didn’t need to.

I swallowed. “Of course. I’ve been keeping my hours tight. Logged everything—”

“Good,” she interrupted, sharper now. “Because billables are the only currency that matters here. And Jackie—” she tilted her head, just slightly, “—don’t make the mistake of thinking you’re indispensable. You’re not. The firm is the bloodstream. We all just keep it pumping.”

It was the kind of line Harvey Specter might drop, casual but loaded. Only coming from Marsha, it didn’t sound slick. It sounded… clinical.

I nodded. “I understand.”

“Do you?” she asked. “Because too many young associates think this is law school with a paycheck. It’s not. We are in the trenches, and if you’re not willing to bleed hours, someone else will. That’s the way it works.”

Her words rattled around in my skull, louder than they should’ve. Normally, I’d take them, absorb them, keep moving. That’s what we all did. But this time something was different.

I glanced at the stack of folders on her desk. The same manila files, the same deadlines, the same endless churn. But when she slid one across to me, I noticed something. A faint scrawl on the corner of the cover—like a mark, almost carved into the cardboard.

It wasn’t pen. It wasn’t pencil. It looked burned.

I froze.

“Problem?” Marsha asked, her eyes narrowing.

“No,” I said quickly, tucking the file under my arm. But my heart was hammering.

“Good. Then get back to work. Don’t leave before nine.” She returned to her pad, already finished with me.

I turned and left, the weight of the file dragging my expensive pumps that were a gift from Derek.

In the hallway, the fluorescents flickered once, twice, then held steady. I could hear the hum of the office, the low drone of printers, the faint clack of keyboards from the paralegals still grinding. But something else pressed against me too—like the walls themselves were leaning closer, listening.

Nine o’clock. Another late night. Another set of hours swallowed into the abyss.

But as I walked back to my desk, I couldn’t shake the thought pulsing in my head.

What if those files weren’t just cases? What if that mark I saw wasn’t an accident?

And what if the basement I wasn’t supposed to know about… was where they all ended up?

 

By the time five o’clock rolled around, I had already resigned myself to the night. My takeout container was still steaming on the corner of my desk, unopened, while Derek’s call played on a loop in my head. He’d canceled dinner—again—this time with a cheerful excuse: *“Big partner stuff, babe. I’ll make it up to you.”*

Of course he would.

That’s when I saw Oswald. Heading for the elevators, quiet as always, his file stack tucked neatly under his arm.

“You heading out already?” I asked, half teasing.

He stopped, looked at me with that calm, oddly detached gaze. “Paralegals are required to leave at five.” His tone wasn’t apologetic. It was matter-of-fact, like he was quoting some rule carved in stone.

“Oh. Right.” I forced a smile. “Well, have a nice night.”

He gave a little wave, turned, and disappeared into the elevator.

My eyes lingered a little longer than I should’ve—his back, broad and impossibly straight, framed against the glow of the closing doors. Then he was gone, and the office swallowed me again.

By the time the sun finally slipped below the horizon, the place had changed. We were all still there—associates scattered across different rooms, too chained to our workloads to even think of leaving. Teams chat was our lifeline now, the occasional ping from someone buried three offices away reminding me that I wasn’t completely alone.

Marsha was still in her glass box, her silhouette lit by the cold glow of her monitor. I could hear the steady tapping of her keyboard whenever I paused long enough to notice.

Then it came.

A dull metallic *thunk.*

The sound drifted from the far side of the floor, toward the dumbwaiter.

I froze, pen in hand.

*Another delivery? At this hour?*

I walked over, footsteps muffled by the carpeted floor thank god, and sure enough—there it was. A fresh stack of documents resting in the little metal drawer.

There was a pitch-black folder like before on top. The slip read: **For Marsha Only.**

Of course.

I glanced toward her office. She was slumped over her desk, head tilted slightly, eyes closed. Asleep. I checked my watch: 8:24 p.m.

My chest tightened.

I’d finished most of my work. I had no reason—*no excuse*—to touch what wasn’t mine. But the weight of those files in the dumbwaiter… it was like they were humming. Like if I didn’t open them, they’d open themselves.

Every instinct I had screamed at me not to do this. It was the kind of feeling that came when you watched a horror movie and were yelling at the girl or the boy not to go down that corner or go through that door because you KNEW something was waiting on the other side.

I moved carefully, angling my body just so, mindful of the black dome of the security camera overhead. One smooth pivot, the file slid open beneath my hands.

And then my blood ran cold.

It was the same as before—shell companies. Obscure legal entities with bank accounts that traced cleanly, numbers and routing details that checked out on the firm’s system. Except these weren’t in places you could fly to. They weren’t even in places you could point to on a map.

**Coordinates listed in negative dimensions. Time stamps for deposits dated centuries in the future. Withdrawals from eras long past.**

One folder referenced “clients domiciled beyond standard jurisdiction of three-dimensional terrestrial space.”

I felt my stomach drop as my eyes combed further through the documents,

Mixed in with the corporate ledgers were notes—scrawled memos that didn’t read like lawyers at all. They spoke of *families*. Not metaphorical corporate families, but actual crime families. Mafia names I half-recognized from law school case studies, only… older. Too old. Names that should’ve died out a century ago.

And then the photo.

I wish I hadn’t seen it.

A glossy print, clipped to the back. A massive shipping crate, the kind you’d expect to see in a freighter yard. Metal, corroded, bolted shut.

And the size of it—easily big enough to hold a car. Or something alive.

I’d seen that kind of crate before, in movies. *Jurassic Park.* Velociraptors slamming against steel walls.

Only this wasn’t Hollywood.

There was no studio. No prop team. Just a black-and-white warehouse shot, timestamp blurred like someone didn’t want me knowing when it was taken.

I shut the file so fast the paper edges sliced my thumb.

A bead of blood welled up instantly, tiny but bright.

Behind me, in the silence of the empty office, the dumbwaiter *clanked* again.

Empty.

Like something had gone back down.

Or was waiting to come up.

I shouldn’t have checked the dumbwaiter again.  
But when I heard that second *clank*, something in me couldn’t help it.

This time it wasn’t a neat stack of manila folders. No, this was heavier, bulkier. A black accordion file, swollen at the seams, wrapped tight with a clasp that looked almost ceremonial. On top of it sat a lockbox—industrial gray, edges scuffed with age. The kind of thing you’d expect to find in a bank vault, not a law firm.

And stamped on the side, faint but undeniable, was a **seal.**  
Raised, wax-like, with a symbol I didn’t recognize. Geometric lines, concentric circles. The kind of thing that didn’t belong on legal paperwork. The kind of thing you might find in a secret society textbook or a forgotten church relic.

A wave of dread broke over me. Not the creeping, low-level kind I’d been battling all week. This was sharp, absolute. My body reacted before my brain caught up—sweat prickled my scalp, my throat tightened, my hands shook.

I didn’t dare open it. Not this time. Not with the cameras overhead, not with the weight of that seal staring at me.

So I did the only thing I could think of.

I carefully lifted the entire accordion file and the lockbox, forced my face into a blank, I’m-just-doing-my-job mask, and walked across the hall to Marsha’s office. She was still slumped at her desk, mouth slightly open, breathing the shallow rhythm of exhaustion.

I laid the file on her desk, gently, like I was placing a bomb.  
Then I backed away.

Back into view of the cameras. Back into the fluorescent wash of my own cubicle light. Back to the safety of pretending I hadn’t just brushed up against something I was never meant to see.

It was only 8:07 p.m. I had already completed everything on my docket, but leaving now wasn’t an option. If anyone asked why I was walking out early, if anyone thought to check where I’d been a few minutes before… I couldn’t risk it.

So I resigned myself to another night. Midnight, at least.  
Another missed gym session. Another sacrifice to the altar of Spitzer, Sullivan & Stern.

But what gnawed at me wasn’t the missed workout.  
It was the thought of the drive home, in my Mercedes, brain fogged with fatigue. I knew how dangerous I got behind the wheel at that hour.

Luckily, the firm provided taxis. For late nights, emergencies, the associates too broken to risk the highway.

By 11:58, I caved. I shut down my computer, grabbed my coat, and pressed the elevator button. The hum of the building changed as I descended. Quieter. Hollow.

The parking garage was almost empty when I stepped out. The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting everything in that washed-out, liminal glow that makes the world look more like a memory than reality.

The taxi was already waiting.

I opened the rear door and slid in. Immediately, I noticed it: a partition wall between me and the driver. Not plexiglass like a regular cab, but something harder. Metallic. Cold.

It felt like stepping into an armored convoy.

The driver didn’t turn, didn’t greet me. Just one low voice, flat and functional, slipped through a tiny slit in the partition.

“Destination?”

I gave him my address.

He didn’t reply. Didn’t acknowledge. The car started rolling forward, smooth and deliberate.

And I couldn’t stop thinking—  
Why all the security?

Who exactly was this car designed to protect?

Me?  
Or whoever was making sure I got home *without questions?*

I hit the mattress like a corpse. Didn’t even change out of my work clothes, didn’t even brush my teeth. Just collapsed.  
Five hours until the alarm. Five hours until I had to drag my over-caffeinated, underslept body back into that skyscraper, back into billing every last breath, every last swallow of burnt coffee.

And in that moment—God help me—I started wishing I’d flunked out of law school like Oswald.  
At least then I wouldn’t be *here.*

That’s when I heard it.

Muffled voices.

Through the door.

Derek.

At first, I tried to ignore it. He took calls late sometimes, and I didn’t want to know. I was too tired to care. But then—

“Yeah, the tranche clears next month… once it’s laundered through the offshore feeders.”

My eyes shot open.

I sat up. Listened harder. The words bled through the thin crack of the door like poison.

“No, Cayman’s too hot. We’re cycling this one through the Dutch sandwiches—shells in the Antilles, then rerouted to the Zurich custodials. After that, it’s ghosted through Tier-2 intermediaries. By the time Treasury blinks, the paper trail’s dust.”

I pressed my bare feet to the carpet and crept toward the door.

Peeking through the peephole, I saw him. Derek. Still in his suit, tie loosened, pacing the hall with his phone to his ear. Calm. Confident.

“Yeah, I know FATF is tightening, but trust me, they’ll never pierce it. Not with the way Spitzer’s people structured the trusts. Legitimate on the surface, encrypted underneath. It’s watertight.”

*Spitzer’s people.*  
My blood ran cold.

He chuckled low into the receiver, voice like oil.

“Exactly. The feds can subpoena Wells all day, it won’t matter. The books bifurcate—what they see, and what *we* see. Clean as daylight on one side, black as hell on the other.”

Pause. A shift in his tone.

“Of course the Families are satisfied. Why wouldn’t they be? We’ve doubled their ROI since Q2. And when the Sicilians and the Russians are on the same ledger without killing each other, you don’t ask questions—you just keep the wires humming.”

The Families.  
My chest tightened.

He stopped pacing, lowered his voice, but I still caught fragments—

“Yeah, Delgado’s firm. They’ve got the infrastructure. Cross-border, multi-jurisdictional filings, everything ironclad. They make it all look *boring as hell,* which is exactly why it works.”

That was me. My firm, Spitzer, Sullivan and Stern. Marsha’s work.  
I stumbled back from the door like I’d been slapped.

Derek’s laugh followed, sharp and satisfied.

“Don’t worry. She doesn’t know. She’ll never know.”

I barely made it to the bed before I heard the key in the lock. I dove under the covers, heart jackhammering, forcing my breathing into slow, sleepy rhythm.

The door opened. His shoes clicked across the hardwood. The mattress dipped as he sat beside me.

His hand brushed my hair.

“Long day, huh?” he whispered. His voice was honey again. Normal. Safe.

I didn’t move. Didn’t answer. Just lay there, pretending to be asleep, every nerve in my body screaming.

Because now I knew.

Derek’s firm wasn’t just finance.  
It was a *front.*  
And worse—somehow, some way—it was tied to *my firm too.*

I didn’t want to move. Didn’t want to face the day. My body ached from yesterday, from the weight of all of it. But I knew I couldn’t. Not after everything that happened last night.

I didn’t shower. Didn’t change. Just shoved on my heels, tore open the bread, threw some slices in the toaster, grabbed them, and bolted. The subway would have to do today.

The firm’s cab service called, cheerfully offering the expressway route. I almost said yes—almost—but then I remembered the last ride. The windows I couldn’t see through, the driver I couldn’t see at all. No, the subway was safer. Safer and honest.

By the time I reached the office, Marsha was already there, perched behind her massive desk like a hawk. She didn’t even look up from her computer when I walked in.

“Jackie,” she said, finally, “I need you to start billing for these additional matters immediately. Some depositions, a couple of motions, and the draft for a summary judgment. We need these tonight.”

I nodded. “Yes, Marsha.”

A big, goofy, obedient smile plastered to my face. I even waved my hand a little, the way you do when a client says something absurd but you can’t actually laugh at it.

Inside, though…

I wanted to rip her head off.

I wanted to scream. I wanted to throw the phone across the room and watch the world explode. I’ve been doing billable hours for **two straight months**, and the workload is relentless. No break, no reprieve. And now she wants more?

I screamed every curse word in my head, each one more violent than the last. The F-bombs ricocheted in my skull. Every insult, every imaginable threat, hurled at her without a single sound leaving my lips.

But on the outside…

Nothing. Just the friendly, bright, *please-don’t-hate-me* grin.

“Yes, Marsha,” I repeated, soft and cheerful.

Marsha nodded and turned back to her screen. Her presence was like a weight, suffocating but oddly hollow. I wanted to tell her everything I saw, everything I found last night—the shell companies, the crates, the accounts that didn’t exist. But I couldn’t. Not yet.

Instead, I sank into my chair, opened ProLaw, and started billing. I could feel every nerve in my body humming with rage.

I hadn’t slept. Not really. Not since… God, I couldn’t even remember. And I hadn’t moved. Not one run. Not one weight. Hell, not even a walk. Months. Months of sitting at a desk, staring at screens, punching numbers into billable hours, while my body quietly screamed in revolt.

This law job. This *soul-crushing, blood-sucking, daylight-stealing nightmare* they called corporate law. I’d have taken an accident on the freeway any day. An eighteen-wheeler smashing into my car wouldn’t have demanded billable hours. Not the paramedics, not the insurance company, not the fucking IRS. Nothing could be *this cruel* naturally.

And then there was Derek. My fiancé. The man everyone adored. The golden boy. Charming, flawless, six-foot-three of sheer charisma and charisma alone. Everyone loved him. Everyone. And now I knew why.

He was a goddamn walking front for the Mafia. Every other crime family in the region. And me? I had willingly tied myself to him. Bought the lie, believed in it. Sat in law school, worked my ass off, scored every top grade, all while he *played the golden-boy angel for the world*—all to fund his rotten deals.

And for what? Why did I even start on this miserable path? Why go to law school at all when starving artists, poets, drifters, didn’t have to log *every fucking minute* of their existence to a ledger that would ultimately betray them? Why?

And the sorority. My “sisters.” God, I hated that fucking sorority. A glorified hazing cult wrapped in pastel ribbons and weekend retreats. And yet we all bought it. I bought it. And Derek? He didn’t need to lift a finger. Just smiled that perfect, stupid grin, and they all fell over themselves. Even me. I was stupid enough to be charmed. I had been *played*.

And the one person who could have seen this—my grandfather—he had. Always had. He had seen it all before anyone else did. He had warned me. He had *warned me about the world*, about the kinds of men who wear charm like armor.

About the things they bring with them, the shadows trailing them like smoke. And then he fucking died. Days before I graduated. He didn’t live to see what came next. And now I was here. Alone.

But then I stumbled onto something deadly serious. Something that made my chest tighten, my stomach knot, my mind spiral. I knew too much. I had seen the shell corporations that didn’t exist in any dimension, the bank accounts that weren’t on any ledger yet traced to real-world banks, the crates, the photos, the files that smelled of something old, corrupt, *primordial*.

And I knew. I couldn’t leave. Not now. Not ever. Not while all this was moving like a slow, inevitable tide around me.

Because if I left… if I walked away… I would vanish. Just like those accounts. Just like those files. Just like… Oswald whispered in my dream:

*Secure. Contain. Protect.*

And suddenly I realized: this wasn’t a game. This wasn’t a law firm. It wasn’t a job, not even Derek. This was something far, far worse. And I was in it. Whether I liked it or not.

I clenched my fists. My teeth. My heart pounded so loud I was sure Marsha in the office down the hall could hear it.

I wasn’t leaving.

I couldn’t.

Because the moment I did… I wouldn’t just lose my job. I wouldn’t just lose Derek, or my sanity, or my life as I knew it. I’d vanish. And something else… something darker… would step into the space I left behind.

And that… that was not an option.

I was halfway through another billing spreadsheet when my phone buzzed. *Marsha*.

“Jackie,” she said, her tone syrupy, “could you come to the conference room? The partners want to see you.”

My stomach dropped. My pulse quickened. The day had been dragging for hours, my mind looping over every shell corporation, every impossible account, every crate photograph. I’d been thinking about leaving. *Walking out*. Slamming the elevator doors on this tower of lies and not looking back.

I wanted out.

I wanted to run.

And then I walked into the conference room.

Three managing partners were there, sitting like statues at the long, polished mahogany table. Their smiles were too sharp, too deliberate, too rehearsed. Marsha stood aside, hands folded, a silent sentinel.

“Jackie,” the first partner said, voice smooth, almost velvet. “We wanted to congratulate you. Truly. Your performance these past few months has been exemplary.”

I nodded, my throat tight. “Thank you.”

“Not just that,” the second partner said, leaning back, hands steepled. “We hear you’re engaged. That wedding is coming up soon, isn’t it?”

I swallowed. “Yes. Next month.”

A slow smirk spread across the third partner’s face. “A happy occasion. Your fiancé must be very proud.”

I forced a polite smile. “He is.”

There was a pause. And then they leaned forward slightly, almost imperceptibly. Their words didn’t need to carry a threat. Their eyes did the work.

“For the sake of your family,” the first partner said casually, “and, of course, your fiancé… it would be prudent not to leave Spitzer, Sullivan & Stern. Your continued presence here is… beneficial.”

The words were soft, almost polite. But they weren’t an invitation. They were a warning.

I could feel my pulse in my temples, my hands tightening into fists I forced to rest in my lap. I wanted to scream, to demand answers, to rip the veneer off this polished hellhole and see the rot underneath.

Instead, I nodded again. “Of course. I understand.”

Marsha gave me a small, approving nod, almost imperceptible. I could hear the faint click of the door as it closed behind me, sealing me in the silent corridor.

And I realized something chilling.

They didn’t have to say it. They didn’t need to spell out what would happen if I left.

1nv6ri4,https://i.redd.it/zcivkn33uhsf1.jpeg,Review #12 - Colonel EH Taylor Single Barrel Bourbon,"Back with another review of my absolute favorite bourbon out there. Colonel EH Taylor Single Barrel is what got me into whiskey and hunting for bottles. I tried this at a bar in Florida for way too much money but it had everything I wanted in a bourbon. Fast forward 6 or so months and I finally found my own bottle for a reasonable price. Fast forward again to now and I'm still milking my bottle, saving it for special occasions as much as I can.

Colonel EH Taylor, the man, was the founder of the OFC Distillery, later to be known as Buffalo Trace. He is given a lot of credit for the Bottled in Bond Act, the law that standardized whiskey to a degree. This line of bottles is currently Buffalo Trace's bottled in bond offering, a fitting salute to Taylor.

EH Taylor Single Barrel is a level above the standard small batch and difficult to find everywhere for a reasonable price. It's almost impossible to find in PA, showing up in very small quantities online only and selling out in literal seconds. I was fortunate enough to find this one at a random liquor store in Louisville during a trip down there.

For those who don't know about Buffalo Trace, or didn't read my earlier reviews on both the namesake bottle or the Benchmark Full Proof: 

Buffalo Trace Distillery is one of the most well known distilleries in the country. From Blantons to BTAC and Pappy, their products are incredibly recognizable and some of the hardest to find for a reasonable price, let alone MSRP. I think that has led some people to call a lot of these products overrated or overhyped for the money. Living in PA, Buffalo Trace products are virtually never on store shelves or behind counters for more than a day after being dropped at the state stores. In fact, I saw a collection of Geroge T Stagg on a shelf in NY for 17k, and a bottle of Pappy 15, vintage 2015 for 5k... these products are incredibly highly priced.

Let's get down to the EH Taylor Single Barrel details. FYI, some of this information is taken from previous reviews because it is the same mashbill...

Mash bill: Buffalo Trace gives very little transparency in its EH Taylor mash bill, but does call it a product of ‘Mash Bill 1’. We only know for sure that it’s a low rye mash bill when compared to BT’s ‘Mash Bill 2’… Allegedly, ‘Mash Bill 1’ has less than 10% rye, and others have speculated that there is almost 90% corn in this mash bill, so quite a low rye concentration. Some other EH Taylor highly limited releases have different mash bills (such as the 4 grain and the grain of the gods limited releases), but the Single Barrel Release is Mash Bill 1 from what I know.

Other popular bourbons from BT use ‘Mash Bill 1’, such as Eagle Rare, the namesake bottle, Buffalo Trace, Stagg, and Benchmark. It might someday be fun to blind a bunch of these and see if I can actually tell any difference.

Price: ~$70.00 with taxes MSRP. I paid $90.00 out the door. This can sometimes have a secondary market in the $200s although I think its market is cooling down. I personally would pay anything under $100 for this bottle but I'm extremely biased towards it.

Age Statement: NAS, but at least 4 years old as it is bottled in bond. I have seen some sites say it is closer to the 9-10 year old range. Unless you have a store pick and know the age for sure that way, it's basically speculation.

Nose: I immediately get a caramel bomb. My first nosing and tastings pointed to caramel bomb. While I get a more complex nose now, the initial nose was only caramel. Now that the bottle has opened up, I get a bit more funk, a little vanilla and brown sugar. There's a very very small amount of baking spices in there as well.

Palate: My first sip of this gives more of the caramel bomb. This pour is one of the 'smoothest' I've ever had. Super approachable, really sweet, really delicious! There's more than just caramel on a re-review. The same notes as the nose are starting to come out. A little bit of spice, a little bit of funk, and a bit more vanilla, molasses, honey come out. I love the taste on this.

Finish: Great finish overall. Decently long, flavors hold, still a lot of caramel. Not a ton of other flavors in there, maybe a little coffee, so not too complex, but still damn good.

Overall, this whiskey is one of my favorites. I would look for backups if possible. Amazing taste, a little overhyped, but to me it is worth the hype. I would pay under $100 for sure, maybe even a little bit more. Now this does have some nostalgia as it's the first whiskey that got me into the whiskey world, but objectively it is still really good.

I'll try to have a bottle in my collection at all times as long as I can find a bottle. Hopefully as the Buffalo Trace production increases, I'll be able to find it more. I highly recommend trying these at bars as long as the price is reasonable, and would absolutely recommend buying a bottle as long as it's reasonably priced. Like any bottle, to me I wouldn't buy it super high over MSRP, but I would pay over MSRP. I'd give this a 9 on the T8KE scale. That score is probably really biased, but it's my own reviews so I get to do what I want and it is an all time favorite for me. Let me know in the comments if you have tried these bottles before and what your single barrels were like!

1nv6qlh,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheChosenOneMethod/comments/1nv6qlh/the_12_universal_laws_no_one_explains/,The 12 Universal Laws no one explains properly—once I learned #3 and #9 my soulmate manifesting went from crickets to coffee dates,"Hey souls, 32F here who spent three years “thinking positively” yet attracting situationships that fizzled faster than my soda water. Once I mapped all 12 Universal Laws (not just the glittery LOA storefront) the breadcrumbs got obvious, same week I met my current partner (10 months, healthy, planning Euro trip).Quick rundown of the laws and the dating-field translation:

1. Divine Oneness—stop believing love is a finite pie.
2. Vibration—tired thoughts = 70 MHz, excited expectancy = 540 MHz.
3. Correspondence—outer matches inner; I journaled until “ghosting” stopped showing up.
4. Attraction—cherry on top once other 11 are handled.
5. Inspired Action—joined volunteer group nudge = how we met.
6. Transmutation—laugh at bad dates, alchemize embarrassment into confidence.
7. Cause & Effect—text speed honesty loops back.
8. Compensation—peace counts as payment too.
9. Relativity—drop comparisons, ask “what is this teaching me?”
10. Polarity—every ex flaw clarified my must-haves.
11. Rhythm—dry spells are winter before spring.
12. Gender—do your part, then *allow* while in bubble-bath mode.

I turned the checklist + 30-day tracker into a short book (“Signs, Synchronicities & Soulmates”) because friends kept DM’ing for my printable. No promo pressure—happy to share the raw list here if anyone wants to DIY. Would love to hear which law hit you hardest and what synchronicities followed!",1,1759321437.0,TheChosenOneMethod,0,1.0,False

Shit, shit and shit. I switch to reception. Over-bright sending is never good. I launch AI in voice. The voice is that of Arnnah Pakkah, the heroine of Melbourne, the one who crawled for miles, at night, in a No Mans Land riddled with mines. She was not from the planet. But she was fighting for the end of the war. My father is one of his descendants. My mother is human, so even though she is one of my ancestors, genetically speaking this is not the case. But this relationship earns me prestige among the crew, which is absurd, but how can we change mentalities?   
__ Captain, this is a distress message from the Tallarisses   
Damn again! I switch to general broadcast, the AI ​​resumes   
__ They were attacked by a squadron of three ships. A notice and what appears to be two transports. The attackers opened fire as soon as they came into range and destroyed the orbital stations    
__ All three?   
__ Confirmation of all three, they damaged both carriers, but inflicted very little damage on the avion.   
  Well, I can't make the decision alone, I turn to the ship's vision screens. Ha! no need to ask them, they are all preparing weapons and taking working exoskeletons out of their racks. I don't know what equipment they have there, but this kind of construction machine is more powerful than combat armor. It must be said that they are about fifteen times their size.

__ Everyone, we are going to exit close to orbit. Tallar is in opposition to the other planets in the system.   
__ Captain, we're going to shoot down their stations.   
__ They are already in ruins, all at the maneuvering posts.      
 The exit is brutal, we oriented ourselves so that the wave front avoids hitting the planet head-on. Both transports, however, have the misfortune of finding themselves right in the path of the gravitic wave. They don't like it, but not at all. We see them on the screens shaking before twisting and exploding, the atmosphere dispersing into space. Several pieces of hull hit the shock shield of the Arnnah Pakkah. Mosquitoes on a glass roof, no more. First maneuver to enter low orbit. We immediately spot the Aviso, like transport, it is a land model. He begins to maneuver and fires, two missiles come straight at us. Little players go! I throw two interceptor syringes. These little things use their kinetic energy to reduce large meteors to construction sand. So barely fired, they are already on their targets, that's two balls of fire. The Aviso maneuvers quite difficult, apparently not because of the damage, but more likely due to a lack of crew. The ship is quite old, having to have been retired from operations several decades ago. Flight assistance is primary. We caught up with him mainly because our initial speed was very much higher than his. A voice comes from the speakers.   
__ He ​​accelerates as if he had the devil up his ass!   
__ Well, we're going to give him some momentum, Hit his butt with the shield     
__ Yeh!   
  A cry from the crew. Just static on the radios. No sound, the shield crushed the rear of the aviso. It leaves orbit swirling. An escape pod. Only one, it drifts with a radio beacon. While we collect it, we land on the planet. Ten construction site exoskeletons. They find themselves facing around forty pirates in combat gear. Aggressive pirates, who immediately went on the attack. Seven seconds, plasma lances do serious damage. A pirate, even with armor, doesn't stop a jet designed to cut up a mountain. Contact from the planet announces the end of operations. And they were slave traders.   The escape pod, a guy, tall, neat, light eyes. I question him. He seems confident, calm. I show him the video taken by my ground team, the corpse of a young man, tortured to death by the collar.    
__ You will have to answer for your actions.   
He starts to laugh softly. Calms down, looks at me and starts laughing again.  
__ Captain, captain, I just gave the others the motivation to stay calm, you are going to hand me over to justice, and?  
__ I look at him, he is too sure of himself.   
__ There will be testimonies which, at your trial…   
__ Tss, tss, there will be no trial. You think I'm a private entrepreneur. I am an associate of important businessmen. The resources in this region of space are staggering. The problem, you see, is that the planets conquered by the union have all moved to confederation of borders, and you know why? no, don't answer, just because the population to colonize these planets was lacking.   
__ Without the border war…   
__ No no, far too many habitable worlds to have strong and industrial planets, which can generate significant economic benefits. So, please believe me, there will be no trial, I will even have another team and another more powerful ship. You should consider avoiding this area in the future.   
__ I actually think that there will be no trial.   
__ Ha, you're starting to understand   
__ No, it’s not that I think so, it’s that I’m sure of it.   
I pull out my gun from my hip. An old Manurhin 357 magnums. He tries to get up, I sit him down with a shot in the stomach. He slips from his chair. I grab him by his suit and pull him into an airlock. He looks at me, his expression somewhere between pain and panic. I close it behind me and eject it into the void. I go to the coffee machine.  I need a little tight black one. My crew enters.   
__ Captain, we need to ask you a question. Of course, I just killed a man in cold blood, even if he was trash, I understand that everyone has questions. The guy was a prisoner, not in a fight. It was an execution. I am waiting for the question that will determine my future on board. Iril Taran, the FTL mechanic, respected by all, an Alleride, calm, competent, he points his finger at my face as I take a sip of coffee.   
__ We would like to know how you manage to swallow this type of oil, which you call coffee, without making a face?

1nv6ots,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1nv6ots/aita_for_talking_back_to_my_boss/,AITA for talking back to my boss,"Hi Charlotte, I've been your silent fan and my day is not complete if I can't watch your videos in YouTube, never in my life will see myself writing here but I just can't stop thinking if I'm the a22wh0le here. I will say sorry in advance for the wrong grammars and long post because every small details is important.

I (24F) started working as a Team Leader at a sugarcane manufacturing that produce white sugar and brown sugar. I can say I'm a fast learner so Rhea(32F) my co-worker who work at the agency for several years taught me the basics like rates for every work we have done. Our boss Adolf(45M) who is the Manager in the agency live with Rhea at the same city(this is important later) and they are the first persons who worked at the agency. At the first week, it was good and they treat me nice and being patient because sometimes I forgot the rates, and I can take a 1 day off every week. Here in philippines its against the law to work 7 days straight and the agency will be summoned to the DOLE (Department of Labor and Employment) for the complaints. But after 3 weeks that I showed good progress and Adolf compliments me for that because I show up on work 10mins before working hours and the people that I handle (20-30 heads) also compliments me and starts to brag to Adolf that they want me to be their Team leader always not Rhea. Rhea is their former Team Leader before I arrived so now its 2 Teams working every shift of the day, My team and Rhea's team. Rex (35M) is my Lead Man in the team, more like he's the one who leads his men in working like bagging sugar, sewing the bags of sugar. My work there is to supervise them, making attendance,making sure that they are safe while working.

It's not the Team Leader's obligations to provide snacks or coffee(sometimes we work 12midnight to 8am) but I'm a people pleaser and clearly see their hardwork and sometimes felt guilty for being a woman who can't join to their work like bagging the sugar. So sometimes like once or twice in a week I treat them with bread from the bakery and coffee to help them. I even give them 2 breaks when they were with Rhea before they were given none. So the time that I started to handle Rex's people we sky rocket the results and income. Before they can only earn P480 ($8.26) which is in the middle of low and average income every shift that Rhea handled them. Now they earn P1200 ($20.64) which is higher than before that's why Adolf compliments me every shift and Rhea starts to distance herself. I start to notice that Rhea is giving me wrong infos and rates like one time I asked for the updated rate she gives me the wrong one, and when it's my time to take a day off she would call in sick or having a doctor's appointment which I can't take a day off because its not possible that two Team Leaders would go absent. So I have to work my ass off for atleast 3 weeks before I can take my day off. 

At first I was worried about her condition, but when I started to see the patterns I started to distance myself also to avoid conflict. I really don't like confrontations because my mouth can be a bit harsh and I regret it later. So when I'm in the mess for the wrong infos that Rhea give to me, Adolf starts to discourage me and sometimes threathens me that he will write me up. My body starts to feel tired that made me have a fever when I got home. I contact my boss that I need atleast 2days off because I have a fever and i have a doctor's note that I need 3 days to recover but my boss only approved 1 day which made me go to work even I have a fever while working. Next issue is when the salary day came, Rex's men asked to our boss if they can take their salary early (4pm is the time we all recieve salary) because they don't have enough money to buy themselves lunch. Adolf declined.

So I asked our boss if they can consider it because I can't let them go to work with stomachs empty. In which he replied ""It's not my problem"". I was dumbfounded. They know that if the workers don't work they can't give good results of income which is what they want because the higher our income the higher they recieve also. So with my last money I payed their lunch in which they are grateful and told me that they will pay me later when our salary comes which they did. They even told me that Rhea never have done this to them before and would let them work even when they are starving. So when its my day off and its Rhea's turn to handle them they would altogether take day off too to avoid Rhea.

So another PayDay came our boss didn't told us that the salary would be delayed and I was hoping for it because I have to buy milk and diapers for my 1 year old  son and some of my men have important bills to pay that its impossible to extend another day like debt,groceries,etc. So we complained that we really need it and stated some of our reason why we need it. Guess what replied ""Not my problem"". I was fed up and ending up talking back ""It's your problem because we worked hard for it, and the only thing you are responsible is to receive our reports, compute our salary and to distribute our salary on the PayDay!"" Forgot to mention, the delayed of salary repeatedly goes up to 4 months and this is the time that we have blown up of frustrations. So He replied ""Watch your mouth lady! Just because you gave good results of work doesn't mean you have the right to talk back. Who's the boss here huh!? You're just new here."" After hearing that I immediately took my bag and left to go home and vent my anger in the pillow because he was an inch close to being smack in the face. He even approved Rhea's last week day off for 1 week just because she was ""homesick"". And he can't even approved my 3days off request because I was having a fever.

1nv6o6g,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1nv6o6g/a_brief_dating_experience_what_the_heck_was_that/,"A brief dating experience, what the heck was that?","I(36,F)just had a weird, at least for me an experience with a guy(33,M) I started to really like and even though it looks like it ended, I want to understand better. Sorry for the long post already.

We met on a dating app around 1.5 months ago and it was all chemistry and sparks through the texts and phone calls. He did chase really hard, asked me out and also said how nervous he had been all the time. He has a history of drug and alchol addiction and has been sober for 2.5 years. Also he was out of the country  for 3 years and came back just this summer home. He has a physical job, a family and the last time we spoke he was living in his mom s house but just rented his own place and about to move out. He has 2 friends.  Anyways the first date went perfect, we ended up spending 5 hours. He held my hand and also kissed me at the end while saying how he wants to see me again. After the date we kept on texting and calling. We said we really like each other and want to go on a second date asap.

Well, after that things started to change a bit. When the date of 2nd date approached I asked him if he wants to do anything particular for the date. He said his family is visitng and cannot meet me. I was like okay, fine. Then the day before the supposed date he called and asked if he can come over and have a sleep over. I said well I dont schedule sex on 2nd dates and said we should know each other a bit more outaide of my house first. He took it well at the moment and said he accepts it and told me he is struggling to accept someone like me being so nice to him. Because he thinks he is unlovable and undeserving in the end. He said he is trying to adjust and gave me a bit of self deprication. Well i briefly assured I dont see him as he described in his self deprication and I am excited to see him and date him...

Come to the day of the date, lo and behold he texted on the day saying he cannot make it. No reschedule, no another time asking. Yet he kept on texting. A few days later i asked him what does he want and he said he really doesnt know what he wants. He wants to be friends first and see how things go... some back and forth and i accepted it. 

He kept texting and calling (30min at least) everyday almost for a month. Except weekends. And he always called me while driving to work as his mom s house is too crowded to talk to me, i guess. Even we are ""friends"",  I always left confused as there was here and there flirting energy as well. Yet over this month he again refused to see me for a coffee, even though he was driving through my neighborhood. He kept finding excuses like how tired he is and how unfun he is. Last time I asked him again and said ""look we met more than a month ago, i like talking on the phone but dont you wanna hang out?"". Gosh, he refused in panic and said he needs to pack his clothes to get ready to move to new place.. after this lame excuse i stopped talking. Later on when he texted to ask me what s happening, I told him i dont understand if he talks to me this much but cannot meet me for 30 min for a coffee... This time he came with another reasoning that he is overstimulated at home and at such a crowded place. He cannot find any peace and how anti social he is to go out. He made jokes, deflected the topic a lot and asked me to give him some time... an indefinite one though. I said i understand him.

Anyway conversation ended there that night but next day he asked me again if i have anything to say. I said no, i asked questions last time like what does he want. If he wanna say anything he can tell me. God then he snapped at me?? I really dont understand why. He said ""i dont fuvking know anymore what else do you want from me, i can explain in 50 languages but if nobody listens i cant do anything. If you wanna stay then stay if you wanna go i wont blame you"". Well, i felt bad, maybe i shouldnt have and should have called out the disrespect, but i just said i heard you and i will stay. After this message of mine it has been days and it s complete slience... he didnt acknowledge or said anyrhing else

I think this was the end of our connection.  I really liked him and wanna understand better. What the heck was that? Any input from you guys are welcome.",1,1759321248.0,AskMenAdvice,38,0.67,False

When the knock came at my office door, I assumed it was Dawes again, or maybe Daniela with another sarcastic remark about how many hours I’d been logging.

Instead, a tall figure stepped in, files balanced neatly in his arms. He was 5’11, lean but muscular, the kind of build you get from strict discipline rather than vanity. He wore black pants, brown loafers, a long-sleeved button-down white shirt, and a red tie. His expression was calm, almost flat.

“Oh, hi,” I said, rising quickly, smoothing the skirt of my suit. “Jackie Delgado. Nice to meet you. I wasn’t expecting a summer associate already.”

The man set the files gently on my desk and extended his hand. “I’m not a summer associate, Ms. Delgado. I’m your legal assistant. My name’s Oswald.”

I froze for half a beat, his name knocking something loose in my memory.

Then it hit me.

“Oswald?” I repeated, my voice softer than I intended. “From FIU?”

For the first time, a faint smile touched his lips. “Yeah. We had a few classes together, if I remember right. You were on the volleyball team.”

A blush crept up my neck. “Right. Of course. It’s just—” I shook my head, fumbling. “I thought you’d gone to law school. I assumed you’d be… well, an associate.”

His smile vanished. His tone stayed even, but his words landed sharp. “I started law school. Didn’t last. Flunked out first semester.”

I blinked, surprised. “Oh, I didn’t know. I thought you—”

“I took the LSAT three times. Got a 150 on my third attempt. Went to an unranked school.” He then lightly scoffed. “Guess I wasn’t built for it.”

I felt my heart sink slightly in my chest. I remembered Derek’s 172 score, his charisma, and the way everyone loved him even when he didn’t try. And now here was Oswald—someone I remembered sweating over prep books, who I was peer mentor to when it came to the law. When I was finishing, he was just starting out.

Physically? Oswald was my type. More so than Derek. But Derek I guess was better connected to me and my social circles than Oswald was.  

***I wish I learned before that wedding that just because you are better connected for someone, doesn’t mean you are right for them.***

“Oh,” I managed, forcing a smile that felt too tight. “Well… it’s good to see you again, Oswald. And thank you for the help. Really. I appreciate it.”

He inclined his head, precise as his movements. “Ms. Dawes thought I could be of use to you. I’ll handle whatever you need. Just let me know.”

With that, he turned and left, silent as a shadow.

Later that day, in the associates’ lounge, I grabbed a quick coffee before diving back into my mountain of files.

“Hey, Jackie.”

I looked up to see David Chen, one of the second-year associates. He leaned against the counter while his coffee brewed, tie loosened just enough to say *casual, but not sloppy.*

“Hey, David. How’s it going?” I asked, stirring cream into my cup.

He smirked. “Long week. Always is. You?”

“Pretty good. Still trying to find my way around,” I then let off a light smile, “My new assistant, Oswald—he’s incredibly helpful!” I chirped.

David raised his eyebrows. “Oswald? Yeah he’s … intense.”

“What do you mean?” I asked, curious.

David tapped the edge of the counter with his knuckle. “Works like a machine. Files are always in order, never a mistake. You’ll never see him complain. But he’s… well lets face it he’s a little off.”

I laughed lightly, though the sound felt out of place. “I thought he was a summer associate at first. I almost embarrassed myself.”

“You wouldn’t be the first,” David said. “He carries himself like one, but trust me—he isn’t. He’s just… here. Always here.”

I frowned. “How long has he been working for the firm?”

David shrugged, grabbing his cup. “Couple weeks, maybe a month. Hard to say. He just showed up one day and Dawes put him on someone’s desk. Guess now it’s yours.”

I nodded, silently sipping my coffee to hide my unease.

David gave me a quick grin. “Don’t overthink it. If he makes your life easier, just roll with it. Plenty of us would kill for an assistant like him.”

I nodded, finishing my coffee.

But as I went back to my office, I couldn’t shake the memory of Oswald back at FIU. We took some of the same classes despite him being a year behind me. We both went to the same gym too, the same gym Derek not long after graduating, stopped going to. But I passed my LSAT on the very first try while he failed one conditional acceptance program and retook the LSAT three times

And now he was here. Not as a fellow associate, but as a legal assistant. My legal assistant. As if law school had never happened at all.

The first time I noticed something off, I told myself it was nothing.

That morning, I had blocked off two hours to work through some files Dawes had left on my desk—mostly dull commercial disputes and one real oddity: an account full of encrypted numbers that didn’t match any system I knew, let alone the federal banking codes we’d been trained to recognize. I’d flagged it in my notes, planning to dig in deeper after lunch.

But when I came back from a meeting, the file was gone. Not misplaced, not shoved under a stack of contracts—just *gone.*

At first I thought Oswald had moved it. He had that unnerving precision about him, the kind of efficiency that made you feel like he could anticipate your needs before you voiced them.

I buzzed his desk.

“Oswald? Did you move a file off my desk? The Williamson account?”

He paused for a second. His voice came back low, even. “No, Ms. Delgado. I haven’t touched anything.”

I sat there staring at the empty spot on my desk, convinced for a few minutes that maybe I had misremembered. Regardless I wasn’t going to fly off the handle over one missing file on my second week.

By the time noon rolled around, I told myself it didn’t matter. I shoved the thought away, grabbed my bag, and joined the others for lunch.

The cafeteria at Spitzer, Sullivan & Stern wasn’t what you’d expect from a law firm. It wasn’t some dark break room with a rattling vending machine. No, this was a bright, airy space on the tenth floor, glass walls stretching high above Brickell Avenue, sunlight flooding the room so warm and golden it almost erased the fatigue in everyone’s faces.

It buzzed with energy—paralegals gossiping in rapid Spanish, partners holding hushed side conversations, junior associates decompressing for thirty blessed minutes before diving back into the fire.

I went through the buffet line, picked up a salad and soup, then spotted Marsha Dawes sitting with a cluster of associates and a junior partner I recognized.

“Hey, everyone. Mind if I join?” I asked, balancing my tray.

“Jackie!” Sarah Miller, a third-year associate with a perpetual air of friendliness, waved me over. Marsha just gave me her subtle nod of approval.

The group was mid-debate over a Wall Street Journal article on some massive merger, their voices tumbling over one another with that strange blend of casual confidence and razor-sharp competitiveness.

“So, Jackie,” Henderson—the junior partner, sharp-eyed, dry wit—leaned back in his chair. “How’s your first few weeks?”

“It’s been intense,” I said, flashing a grin. “But I’m learning a lot. Everyone’s been really helpful.”

“Good,” he said, biting into his sandwich. “Don’t hesitate to ask questions. Even the dumb ones. We’ve all been there.” He winked, drawing laughter.

I laughed too, but my eyes wandered across the cafeteria.

In the far corner, away from the chatter and the windows, Oswald was sitting alone.

He was hunched over a massive hardbound book, not a novel or a casebook but something denser. Finance. His brow furrowed, eyes moving silently up and down the page.

Sarah followed my gaze. “Oh, that’s your assistant, right? Oswald?”

“Yeah.” I nodded, forcing casualness into my tone. “He’s… very focused. I don’t think I’ve seen him take a real break yet.”

Ben, another associate at the table, chuckled. “Doesn’t talk much. Keeps to himself. But the guy’s efficient as hell. Like scary efficient. Gets things done before you even finish asking.”

I nodded. “Yeah. I’ve noticed that.”

“He’s got his routines,” Sarah said, picking at her salad. “Always sits at that table. Always reading something dense. Last week it was a paperback fantasy. Now it’s finance.”

Henderson leaned in. “Bright kid. Quiet. A little weird, but sharp. He’s an excellent assistant!” He gave me a small grin, correcting himself: “You’re …” he hesitated. “…Good to have him.”

“Definitely,” I said, though my eyes lingered on Oswald longer than I meant them to. There was a quiet intensity to his demeanor. Almost like he had a second sight that knew, or otherwise sensed things that the others did not.

And the worst part was that I felt it too.

“Does he… ever join you guys?” I asked quietly.

The group exchanged glances.

“Never seen him sit with anyone,” Ben said. “Always eats alone. And quick too.”

Sarah hesitated, her tone softening. “After, you know… law school not working out… I think he keeps to himself. Probably doesn’t want to deal with the chatter.”

I nodded slowly, pretending that made perfect sense. But my thoughts snagged, circling back to the missing file on my desk, the one that vanished without explanation. For a moment, I wondered if Oswald had done it. If he’d taken it. If his obsessive studying and his silence were covering for something else entirely.

But then Henderson cracked a joke about the merger, the table erupted in laughter, and I forced myself to smile along. By the time I glanced back at the corner, Oswald was gone.

And the thought hit me like a whisper I didn’t want to hear.

***Oswald and I knew the same thing.***

After lunch, I went back upstairs and logged into ProLaw. Only I logged into various other systems too and pulled up the documents from earlier.

Only, they weren’t there.

The leasing agreements, the land permit memos, and the odd client files that I saw earlier didn’t show up on Google, LexisNexis, or Westlaw. They were completely gone. In their place were the sort of cases every first-year associate would kill for: Carnival Cruise Lines. UM Health. Florida Power & Light. The type of files you could point to and say, *yes, this is real work for real clients*.

I sat there for a moment, staring at the monitor, scrolling through the case list like maybe I’d missed something. But no—it was scrubbed clean. All buttoned-up and normal.

Marsha sent me a teams message.

“Please prepare a leasing memo for the new Carnival ship. I’ll need it by end of week.”

“Yes Ms. Dawes.” I replied back.

I opened the firm’s memo template and filled in the headers. I started typing boilerplate language about maritime leasing provisions and Florida statutory requirements. My fingers moved automatically, but my eyes flicked, every few minutes, back to the ProLaw screen.

That’s when Oswald walked in. No knock, just a soft shuffle of his shoes against the carpet. He had a file in his hand.

“I found it, Ms. Delgado,” he said with a flat tone as he placed the file on her desk.

The label was typed neatly across the tab. Nothing unusual. But the second his hand left the manila cover, I noticed the faintest indentation of something written beneath the type, as though another title had been erased—or maybe overwritten.

I smiled politely, corporate, professional. “Thanks, Oswald.”

He nodded, but lingered for a second too long before stepping back out of my office.

The folder Oswald had brought sat on my desk was neat, unassuming, and colored all black. I opened it slowly, first with curiosity, and slowly with creeping, uncanny dread.

Inside were reports and company manifests, all formatted perfectly—company letterheads, contact information, corporate numbers. Only, none of these companies existed. Not one. At least, not outside the pages of the folder.

Yet the firm’s system said otherwise. I typed in each company name, traced the account numbers, cross-referenced the Wells Fargo main branch codes listed. They all checked out. Everything was real. Everything *was there*.

I stared at the folder for what felt like an eternity, a chill crawling up my spine despite the warm office air. I carefully parsed the documents for metadata, hidden footnotes, for anything that could explain how a company could *exist and not exist at the same time*. But I would need access to the encrypted files and Marsha had the password. I didn’t.

Frustrated, I dialed the Wells Fargo branch number listed in the folder.

“This is Jackie Delgado, associate at Spitzer, Sullivan & Stern. I’m calling about these corporate accounts.”

A polite but firm voice answered. “I’m sorry, Ms. Delgado. We can only speak to the account holder on file—Ms. Dawes.”

I pressed, “I understand, but I have documents that reference these accounts, and I need verification.”

“I’m afraid I really can’t,” the teller repeated. “Please have Ms. Dawes call us.”

I hung up, my pulse quickening. The files on my desk suddenly felt heavier, like they carried their own weight. And then, as if on cue, the office door clicked open.

“Jackie,” Marsha’s voice called, crisp but warm, “how’s your day going?”

I snapped my attention back to the computer, clicking rapidly to close the folder Oswald had delivered, stashing the folder in my desk. The files for Carnival Cruises and UM Health remained open, normal, innocuous.

“Good,” I said evenly, forcing my tone to sound casual. “Just finishing up the leasing memo you sent.”

Marsha stepped fully into the doorway, arms crossed, scanning the room briefly before settling her gaze on me. “Everything running smoothly? Don’t hesitate to ask if you need anything.”

“Understood Ms. Dawes.” I replied, keeping my voice light, professional.

She nodded once, sharp and decisive, then turned to leave. As the door shut behind her, I exhaled slowly. My eyes drifted back to the pitch black folder. The one Oswald had brought. I shoved it into the side drawer, pressing it flat against the bottom where it wouldn’t be seen. Sitting back, I stared at it as the folder’s edge poked out of its hiding spot.

Should I tell her?

The thought looped in my mind. If I did, would she laugh it off, chalk it up to a system glitch, or would she see what I saw? I shook my head, forcing focus. Better to act normal. For now.

The files that didn’t exist were still there, somewhere, waiting. I didn’t know if anyone else could see them—or if they were meant to be seen at all.

And that thought made me shiver.

I went back to my desk, trying to shake off the earlier unease, but the file Oswald had delivered earlier kept gnawing at the back of my mind. The folder was locked—restricted, password-protected—and I couldn’t scan it for hidden details.

I gave into temptation, took the folder from its hiding place…And then I froze.

The name on the first page made my stomach twist like icy knives. It was Derek’s company. The one where my fiancé worked. My hand hovered over the tab, reluctant, trembling slightly.

I opened the folder, my eyes scanning for anything I could make sense of. The original documents seemed normal enough—company formation paperwork, investment summaries.

But as I flipped through, I realized the ledger wasn’t just for their legitimate accounts. Somehow, through a labyrinth of encrypted entries and impossible numbers, the books included both the real operations *and*… something else. Something I couldn’t fully trace.

I swallowed, my throat tight. A cold knot settled in my gut.

I left my desk, the polished floors of the associates’ wing echoing softly beneath my heels. Oswald was in the mail room, flipping through a stack of envelopes with his usual quiet focus.

I glanced at the black folder in my hands and slowly walked towards him. He looked up as I got closer.

Before I could open my mouth to say a word, another paralegal with a sharp, quick step, intercepted me, and the file was suddenly in another set of hands. Renata, one of the senior paralegals, stood before me. Her squint made her eyes look sharp and predatory. Her gaze locked onto me.

“Where did you get this?” she asked, her voice calm but firm, every word measured.

“It… Oswald brought it.” I forced out. “I was just—”

Renata cut me off with a small shake of her head. “No, Ms. Delgado. This is Marsha’s case. Her clients. You shouldn’t have it.”

I opened my mouth to argue, but she didn’t give me the chance. She took the folder from my hands, flipped the folder closed and tucked it under her arm. Her squint deepened. Before I could react, she walked over to the dumbwaiter mounted in the wall of the mail room, opened it, and slid the folder inside. The small metal door clanged shut.

“Where is that going?” I asked, my voice shaking slightly.

“The basement level.” she replied, eyes not meeting mine.

I blinked. “The… basement?” My mind was scrambling. “This building has a basement?”

She nodded, lips pressed tight. “Only the partners can go down there.”

I felt my pulse spike. My stomach turned over, a low, crawling chill crawling up my spine.

“I… I don’t understand,” I stammered. “Why would Marsha’s clients’ files go there?”

Renata gave me a small, tight-lipped smile. “Some things aren’t meant for associates. You’ll learn, Jackie.”

Her words should have reassured me. They didn’t. The clanging of the dumbwaiter door seemed louder than it had any right to be, echoing in the mail room long after she’d gone. I stayed rooted to the spot, staring at the metal hatch, imagining the folder descending into darkness.

I could feel it—some part of the firm I hadn’t been allowed to see, some shadow that operated behind the polished marble and sunlight-filled offices. And at the center of it, my fiancé’s company name… staring back at me from that folder, a cold, impossible knot of truth and unknown.

I wanted to know more, to demand answers, but even the thought of the basement made my skin crawl. Only partners could go down there and I was just an associate. And yet, I couldn’t shake the sense that the folder—and everything in it—had secrets waiting for me, watching, just below my feet.

That evening, I went home after another late night of logging billable hours at the firm. I barely switched out of my pencil skirt, collared shirt and blazer and into sweats and a t shirt before I collapsed into bed. I tried to put it behind me

But between the things I kept seeing and reading in files, and the long nightly hours, I couldn’t sleep. I could barely stay awake without slurping down four or five cups of coffee.

The next morning, I overslept. Good thing I didn’t change out of my clothes as I barely caught the metro in time. I didn’t go to my desk, not right away. Instead I went to the bathroom in an attempt to collect myself.

I then recognized the hard, steady clacking of shoes on tile from just outside my stall. They didnt sound like they were being made by cheap pumps purchased at JC Penny or Kohls. No, these sounded expensive, like the designer heels from Gucci and Neiman Marcus only affordable by the partners. The clicking of their heels against hard tile were low, measured, and conspiratorial.

I pulled my legs up so my flats couldn’t be seen under the door.

“Two associates gone. Tried to quit. Said they’d been talking to that agency again. The one that… secures, contains, protects.”

That had woken me up as they continued.

“Idiots.” The man said. “They thought they could dig into encrypted files and just… walk away? No one just walks away.”

The other woman gave a short laugh. “Poof. Gone. And good riddance.”

My heart sank and my blood ran cold.

Then the woman’s tone sharpened. “It was about that same file. The one floating around last week. The one that should’ve been sealed.”

My stomach dropped. They were talking about *my* file. The one Oswald had slipped me.

The man sighed. “That file should’ve never left the basement. If it shows up again, we’ll have bigger problems than a couple of missing associates, especially if the insurgency figures we can’t deliver.”

They washed their hands, heels clicking away.

I was frozen, heart hammering, legs trembling in the air. I could still hear Derek’s voice from last night: *Billions. Partner. Global wedding.*

And now all I could think was: *What did he sign his soul away for?*

That night, I dreamt of grandpa.

Not the frail man I last saw in the hospital bed, with tubes in his nose and monitors chirping like mechanical birds. This time he was much younger. Standing tall, clear-eyed, wearing that same tweed jacket he wore whenever he took a walk or went about town. The same jacket my mother always teased him about, saying it looked “twenty years out of season.”

But looking back on it now? I would do anything to see him in that jacket again.",2,1759321242.0,DarkTales,0,1.0,False

I sit here watching yesterday’s news,
a rerun of Good Morning America.
not sure if I’m keeping up with the world
or just trying to feel less invisible in it.

to be honest,
to be fucking frank,
I’m bored. it’s 6 a.m.
the coffee-colored sky hasn’t even bothered to show yet.

I’ve been up off and on all night
like a bad radio signal.
caffeine pills keep me from the nightmares
and deliver me straight into the boredom.

some people wake up
and don’t hurt themselves.
some people like their own reflection.
I try to imagine that.
it’s as strange to me
as a man living on the moon
or a dog reciting poetry.

I keep thinking:
why can’t I stop doing this to myself?
but the question floats there,
a balloon with no string,
while I sit in the glow of a television
telling me about a world
I can’t seem to join.

1nv6lcy,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nv6lcy,Q3 Coffee 2025,"Hello r/pourover, I am here in this 3 month period to drop some short(?) reviews/notes on a few of the coffees I have had, in hopes of having any type of discussion on the coffee! (If these should be kept in the weekly discussion thread let me know) I would love feedback on any notes I have written if you all would allow it, so I can improve the way I am describing what I am tasting in these cups, or just to discuss different tasting notes experienced with these coffees. The last two posts I have not made much of an effort to write what I was tasting, but I AM HERE to change that.


All of these cups were brewed on the Timemore C2 held BASICALLY horizontal, 22 clicks. 1:17 or 1:18 ratio, usually with 15g or 20g of coffee. Aiming for between 2:30-3:00 brew time on all, with a few seconds of deviation due to user error. All on the V60 with Cafec TH-3 papers (identical to the T-90, just hardly ever sold out on Rogue Wave’s website). Used usually between 92-96C temperature with 1/3 TWW diluted in RO water, to get the specifics out of the way! Also 3-4 weeks of rest is usually what I get down with, outside of a cup immediately at two weeks out of impatience.

**1. Pepe Jijon Experimental Washed Sidra from Flower Child** - Purple/black grape, plum, blackberry syrup, ripe fig. Random red flower name to denote maybe a 3 or 4 out of 5 on the florality (I dont really know the smell of that many flowers just off the top like some of you botanists), closer to tea-like but still some texture in the cup, raspberry jam note is there! I would say it hits that jammy criteria, like cooked dark fruits. The description Flower Child put out and the list of notes were pretty right on! The vanilla bean note is definitely around what I believe is the level of sweetness/aroma, very little bitterness and mild-moderate citrusy acidity. Gets even more sugary as the cup cools down in both the initial taste and the finish. This Sidra has such a great mix of a berry/stonefruit sweetness. Contains so many different, great flavors and such intense sweetness.

**2. Wilder Lasso Anaerobic Washed (Mint Co-Ferment?) SL-28 from September** - After I initially reviewed this particular bean in my 33 cups of coffee notebook, I saw a post on here stating it was more of a mint co-ferment based on September’s description. I overlooked that when I bought it, but to me, that is neither here nor there. This was the extra light option. Initially when hot up front tart red berries similar to I would say underripe raspberry, but still had a pronounced sweetness to it with a sharp acidity you could point in the direction of something lemony. Cooled down to room temp, it transitions into something more of a slightly sweet hibiscus tea with somewhat of a minty coolness in the linger to it, definitely tea-like in structure as I had primarily brewed this at a 1:18 ratio. I thought it was a very clean cup, as it had a minty linger, had those red fruit notes, minimal body. I enjoyed it quite a lot, but I do agree it would be more apt to call it a mint co-ferment than anaerobic washed.

**3. Juan Peña Hacienda La Papaya Reserva Natural Mejorado from H&S Coffee Roasters** - Right off the bat, delicate candied citrus fruits with moderate-intense sweetness that Fruit Loops basically taste like to me RIGHT off the bat. Soft florals in the nose, I can see something like jasmine or even the violet at the #3 note spot on the bag. This is what I would call a clean natural and *wow*, is this good. This has a raw sugar like sweetness to it, it is really intense in that sweet aspect, just like the *damn* Fruit Loops. Really ripe strawberry, even slight dragonfruit flavor comes through. In a way, it reminds me of something similar to a strawberry-banana smoothie in that sweet semi-acidic way. Definitely leans tea-like but still some syrupy texture in this cup as the flavor itself is so rich in that cereal milk-esque, lemony way. This is really the main flavor I have for this one but it is SO clean and so well defined, candied lemon/jasmine/ripe strawberry is how I would a crack at a 3 note listing. I tried a bloom + four pour recipe once with these beans and I really did not like the high agitation method of going about this coffee, definitely was best to stick with bloom and single pour in my opinion.

**4. Alo Bona Zuria Washed Ethiopian Landrace from Shoebox Coffee Roasters** - This was an incredibly clean cup with an upfront, dominant green tea note with a very sharp lemon acidity and meyer lemon/candied lemon sweetness. There was just a sweet, earthy feel to the aroma like green tea and as the cup cooled down, I got a delicate apple/pear-like malic acidity in addition to the overall green tea/lemon dominance, which I did have to lookup if malic acidity is present in green tea, and it is! This really reminds me of “if the smell of lemony-matcha was injected into a coffee.” As of writing this review, I have three more bags on the way. I think this could end up being coffee of the year for me, this is exactly what I am looking for in a cup of coffee and I think it is my favorite coffee I have ever had. I really enjoyed the clean, green tea structure of this one and the sweetness/mild lemon acidity that came with it. I really enjoyed the matcha green tea like mouthfeel that came along with this as well. 

**5. Halo Hartume Washed Ethiopia Landrace from SEY Coffee** - First impression when hot, strong peach tea presence in the cup. Maybe borderline cooked peach/peach cobbler with the sugary sweetness right upfront. Obviously tea like body, I would say this contains a deep orange/yellow stone fruit flavor with a rather pleasant florality to it. SLIGHTLY silky in the way a mango would be. Very clean with relatively tame acidity, not the brightest cup but definitely a great peach tea adjacent and obvious stone fruit flavor. Slightly savory but not at all salty, more of a citrus fruit acidity than tropical fruit acidity, but I would say this presents as if it were a sweet, floral peach tea. One day I pushed it a little too far and it kinda tasted like underripe apricot, but that was definitely my fault!

**6. Jose Jijon Washed Mejorado from September** - Right off the bat I definitely understood the juicy pear note, as it had that apple/pear acidity to it, super sweet in that marshmallow/caramelized sugary way. It was not the most INTENSE sweetness, but it was very pronounced throughout every temperature of this cup. Slight lemon-like acidity, the aroma was full of florality, I would say yellow was the first color that came to mind. I would say when the cup cooled, the sweetness leaned more toward honey-esque. I wrote down tame lemongrass as a way to describe the florality in the taste, but that was minuscule compared to the sweetness and pear/lemon fruitiness/acidity to it. 

**7. Juan Peña Hacienda La Papaya Anaerobic Washed Sidra from H&S Coffee Roasters** - Intense purple berry/red grape juice notes when hot, slightly velvety but mainly juicy/round mouthfeel. Leans into a slightly sweet, but primarily tart finish. As the cup cools down to room temp, you definitely can see more a profile that a ripe mango would offer, a little bit silky, a little sweeter and a little less tart. It definitely has that small amount of funk to it, but the tropical/berry flavor carries the overall profile. I would dare to call it spiced mango, as it sort of leans into a more cooked/stewed fruit aspect, with a touch of that tropical fruit acidity level. This might be the first coffee I have had, that I taste a slight apple note and not recognize it as pear, this feels like a MAJOR win for me. As the cup is getting cold, definitely brings out more of that spiced quality. Definitely not an overwhelming spiced quality by any means, but you get that hint of maybe something akin to pumpkin spice.

**8. Getachew Zeleke Washed Ethiopian Landrace from Shoebox Coffee Roasters** - Strong, enticing floral aroma of vanilla immediately on the nose, I could even go as far to say something like a lavender/violet on the backend of that florality. Clean sweetness reminds me of that acai note, maybe dragonfruit, slight cantaloupe, slight essence of pear. Very tame acidity, allowing the sweet florals to be at the forefront of the cup. Round mouthfeel, I wouldn’t say it’s dry but I wouldn’t say it’s juicy, quite a balanced mouthfeel. This is a really florally aromatic cup with a nice berry/melon flavor profile in the sweetness/acidity. I really enjoy coffee where the chocolate/caramel notes take a backseat to the fruit/floral notes(shocker, I am sure). I dont know if I have had a white tea to comment on that tasting note on the bag, but I can see something in the realm of what that might mean. This would probably be my favorite offering from Shoebox, if it wasn’t for that citrus green tea bomb in the Alo Bona Zuria.

At some point in 2024, a fire station in Scotland responded to a call to assist my obese, bedbound mum, who had fallen ill. The ambulance crew couldn’t remove her: she was also a hoarder. By some incredible feat of physical and mental endurance, the firefighters got her out of the rubbish-filled upstairs bedroom, down the stairs (removing the banister as well), and out a narrow hallway full of human and general waste. Even worse, my mother was a nasty person: she would not have been grateful, and she would not have made it easy.

It was hard enough for me to endure and navigate that house once she passed. I cannot imagine what she put those firefighters through trying to manhandle her out.

As you can tell, there’s no love lost. I know she was mentally ill. But ultimately it was due to her bad choices, self-inflicted illnesses and alienation of all friends and family that it fell to emergency services to do this for her. I keep worrying a firefighter ended up with back problems because of her. I’m worried they keep thinking about what they saw, or were berated by her.

I plan on finding out which department responded, and sending a thank you card. I’d also love to get a gift for them once the house is sold. What would a fire station appreciate most? I know cash/vouchers can’t really be given, but would they like something like a good coffee machine, air fryer or a toastie press? Or just a gift basket of snacks? I’d have a budget of about £500.

Testing Mrs. Meyer’s Clean Day Multi-Surface Everyday Cleaner, I couldn’t help but notice how perfectly the product fits into a busy, multitasking household. The fact that this cleaner comes with the quirky and refreshing “Fresh Cut Grass” scent was intriguing enough to make me wonder how much of an impact it would have on my cleaning routine. With a full spectrum of surfaces to cover around my home, from countertops to bathroom tiles, I felt like I gave this all-purpose cleaner a genuine workout.

**Performance and Cleaning Power**

The first spray immediately revealed how easily Mrs. Meyer’s cleaner tackles even the tougher patches of grime on my kitchen counters. Coffee spills and dried pasta sauce? Gone in a few quick swipes. The cleaner seems highly effective on various surfaces, including glass and sealed stone. It claims to be safe for walls and finished wood as well, so my doors and shelves even got their turn. I never once felt like it was too abrasive or leaving behind a murky residue—a clean I could actually trust to see and feel.

**Good Points**

- Quick action in removing stubborn dirt and stains  
- Safe and gentle on delicate finishes such as wooden surfaces  
- Leaves spaces with a pleasant yet balanced summer-like scent  
- Eco-conscious ingredients that feel safer for both the household and environment  

**How Does It Smell?**

You read “Fresh Cut Grass” on the label, and you're probably picturing mowing your lawn on a perfect June morning. You wouldn’t be wrong. While I’m no stranger to citrusy cleaners or lavender-heavy sprays, this unique fragrance did surprise me in all the right ways. I found the scent brightened up my rooms without being overwhelming—a nice touch during a late-afternoon scrub session when the windows are open.

**Positives of this Cleaning Spray**

One of its most reassuring traits is its use of plant-based and biodegradable cleaning agents. It’s hard these days to find a cleaner that scrubs effectively without a laundry list of chemicals, so this stood out right away. Also, being cruelty-free, it earns bonus points for the extra thought behind its formulation. My dog snuck into the freshly cleaned kitchen, and I didn’t have to worry about any harsh residues left on surfaces he might touch!

- A cruelty-free product, as advertised, and not animal-tested  
- Fresh but not overpowering scent, ideal for use throughout the day  
- Safe on various materials, meaning fewer products cluttering your shelves  

**Negatives of this Product**

Despite loving the overall usability, I’d call out a few slight frustrations.

- The sprayer nozzle isn’t adjustable for mist vs. stream, making certain tasks a bit awkward  
- More diluted than some heavy-duty cleaners, requiring a bit more product on tricky areas  
- Doesn't work as effectively on unsealed or heavily porous surfaces—avoid untreated stones  

**Areas for Improvement**

- A little more versatility in how the bottle sprays would be beneficial  
- Maybe consider offering a version with an extra-strong grease fighter  

**Competing Brands in All-Purpose Cleaning**

While Mrs. Meyer’s stands out as a fresh and eco-friendly cleaner, it’s hard not to compare it to Method’s all-purpose cleaner or Seventh Generation’s plant-based sprays. Method holds its own with cleaner scents like grapefruit or eucalyptus mint, which pack a punch without feeling artificial. Meanwhile, Seventh Generation leans hard into neutral formulations that cater to sensitive households. Mrs. Meyer’s undeniably excels with its fragrance variety, but where it edges ahead is in the balance it provides—cleaning strength without toxicity. If pure cleaning power is your top need, though, you might find products like Simple Green better suited.

**Smart Spending**

Evaluating Mrs. Meyer’s 323598 for its price wasn’t difficult, especially when measured against my growing stack of multi-surface cleaners. It aligns with other reputable options in affordability and manages to pack strong features like eco-consciousness and gentleness into every ounce. If you’re looking for something functional yet fragrant, consider paying slightly above average for what’s essentially two products—cleaner and room refresher.

1nv6joa,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1nv6joa/need_service_for_kf8/,Need service for KF8,"I have a 9 month old KF8. For the past month it has has had a few different problems. 


Initially I thought that they were caused by semi-oily beans. I cleaned the brew unit, descaled. It stared working but sometimes it would not dispense milk in the second cup of coffee it made.

Now it does by dispense water at all when the tank is full.
I removed the new filter just in case it was causing this issue but it did not help. I removed and added the water tank a couple of times 

Do I have to mail it or can I get local service? I am in Atlanta.

I have owned a variety of coffee machines but none as expensive as KF8. Disappointed that it broke down in 8 month. We only make 2 cups of coffee a day. Always cleaned as recommended.

Let me know if any one has any suggestions for me
