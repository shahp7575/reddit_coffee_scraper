Today I spilled coffee on my phone case, which has a couple of my stickers on the back of it. It seems to be just fine, but I realized I should have done more product testing, just in case.

I have no way to prime it through the sprout because my model has no knob to turn , spout just plugs. Taken out the tank and reinserted firmly, opened the back to see if I got water on the inlet tube and there is. 

So every time I press OK to continue filling the system with water there’s just a slight hum noise and nothing happens and the error comes back up. Unplugged for an hour , came back and same thing , once I did manage to reset back to the initial setup and skipped it to try to make some coffee straight away but again water circuit empty.

1oye84t,https://www.reddit.com/r/stuffyouneeddaily/comments/1oye84t/which_smart_plugs_support_compatibility_with_alexa/,Which smart plugs support compatibility with Alexa?,"Hey everyone!

So I've been diving deep into the smart home rabbit hole lately, and one question kept popping up in my research: which smart plugs actually work well with Alexa? After testing a bunch and doing way too much reading, I figured I'd share what I learned.

**The Short Answer**

Most major smart plug brands work with Alexa these days, but some are definitely better than others. The big names like TP-Link Kasa, Amazon Smart Plug, Wyze, and Gosund all have solid Alexa compatibility. I've personally used three of these, and setup was pretty straightforward for all of them.

**What Actually Matters**

When you're shopping for smart plugs that work with Alexa, here's what you should look for:

- Voice control capability (obviously)
- Easy setup through the Alexa app
- Scheduling features
- Energy monitoring if you care about tracking usage
- Compact design that doesn't block other outlets

The Amazon-branded smart plug is kind of the no-brainer option since it's made specifically for Alexa. But honestly, I found other brands work just as well and sometimes cost less.

**My Experience**

I started with two TP-Link Kasa smart plugs for my living room lamps. The setup took maybe five minutes total. You download the manufacturer's app first, connect the plug to your wifi, then link it to Alexa through the skills section. After that, you can control everything by voice or through the Alexa app.

Now I have six smart plugs around my apartment controlling lamps, a fan, my coffee maker, and even my phone charger. Being able to say ""Alexa, turn off bedroom lamp"" when I'm already in bed is genuinely awesome.

**Where to Find Good Options**

If you're ready to jump in, I'd recommend checking out [this collection of smart plugs](https://goodhomedeals.com/smart-plugs) that work with Alexa. They've got various brands and price points, so you can compare features and find what fits your budget.

**Common Issues I've Seen**

Some cheaper no-name brands from random sellers can be hit or miss with Alexa integration. The connection might drop randomly, or the companion app is clunky and confusing. Stick with recognized brands that have actual customer reviews and you'll save yourself headaches.

Also, make sure your wifi reaches wherever you're planning to put the smart plug. Seems obvious, but I learned this the hard way when I tried putting one in my garage.

**Bottom Line**

Smart plugs with Alexa compatibility are genuinely useful and not just a gimmick. They're affordable, easy to install, and actually make daily routines more convenient. Whether you want to automate your home devices, set schedules, or just turn things off without getting up, they're worth it.

If you're interested in seeing what's available, [here's a good starting point](https://goodhomedeals.com/smart-plugs) with options that all support Alexa voice control.

1oye80j,https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLitEwMbjPbmGRvbHkDLG5DMuCYfVXSGZb&si=KBiqh5TqkOfZy14m,I think schizophrenia made me do this (visual musical story ),"On my Facebook, when I had strong feelings about something or someone, I felt an urge to share a song that expressed my feelings, often accompanied by a video. As long as I managed to express what I had inside me, I felt satisfied and it allowed me to build a story.

One day, while visiting my hometown, I briefly met a girl whom I didn’t see again for years. Several years passed until one day I saw her on Facebook, and after exploring her personality a bit, I decided to try starting a conversation.

At first it went well, but later I realized she had gone through a heartbreak and was still dealing with those feelings. I kept trying to talk, we exchanged some songs, but at one impulsive and immature moment I tried too hard to push for an in-person coffee, and she didn’t like that, so she decided to cut off the conversation.

I really liked this girl, so my solution was to try building a musical story on my fb to see if I could recover the initial moment and try again. I kept searching until I found the song and video that I felt expressed things well. I did **not** have schizophrenia at that time.

After some time, when I felt the need to do it , sometimes I would hear my inner voice / my own thought telling me the name of a song or a band where I might find something. They weren’t subconscious memories, because most of the names that came weren’t from groups or songs I knew. Sometimes they were perfect hits, other times I had to search because, for example, only ‘Sebastian’ would come to mind and another word was missing. But the truth is that I always found a song that fit with the previous ones and with the symbols of the story I was trying to tell her.

After a while, I began to notice that the songs themselves seemed to be trying to explain the process to me in their music videos and even in some of the lyrics.

It was only about a year after this process started that I began to have symptoms of schizophrenia. In the first years I only heard the neighbors as if they were shouting things at me from their balconies, as if I were on a reality show.

After some years and other loves, the schizophrenia symptoms worsened and I started hearing 4 to 6 voices, always the same ones, 24/7, but internally in my mind, with the same attitude as the voices I had heard in the neighbors trying to make me believe I was in a reality show.

The voices stopped for three years, and it was during that time that something clicked: I realized I had gone through a years-long episode of schizophrenia.

I had other crushes and never stopped posting songs on Facebook, which sometimes also carried the meaning of that process I wanted everyone visiting my Facebook to understand. Meanwhile, the voices returned almost five years ago, the neighbors voices and half a dozen internal ones — and it has been more difficult.

They don’t like me calling the process ‘intuition.’

I leave you a summary in a playlist of 25 songs I put together so that people who didn’t see it live on Facebook can try to understand the process.

It has to be seen like a movie i promise that, among all my different and strange thoughts, it will make sense and show something special, whether it’s my imagination or not.

I even told him I said ""hey can I borrow your phone to take a picture, mine needs to be charged"". He grabbed it from on the coffee table and seemed really agitated and tried getting our cats attention to take the photo himself. 

I'm just wondering if this is weird behavior especially due to the way he reacted (bothered and agitated) when I asked if I could borrow it to take it myself to not bother him or interrupt too much with the project he was working on.
I'm not sure if I'm overreacting or not especially since he's been a bit untrustworthy in the past, but I also wasn't asking to go through it either. In fact I wouldn't even have to unlock his phone to use the camera app.

1oye65c,https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1oye65c/i_recently_had_my_first_date_ever/,I recently had my first date ever,"I want to share the story about my first date ever that I recently had this Friday 

I asked a girl from my university, to drink some coffee and walk around the campus, after final exams, I had the courage to do it because I have few to none chances of seeing her again (not actually, currently the possibilities of coinciding again in another class are much higher, but I didn't knew it back then), so I asked her out. She agreed. 

After all we have a lot in common, the first time I saw her, I had an interest in her, but we barely talked the previous semester. 

On both occasions I was repeating classes that I lost, but in this semester I had to my advantage the fact that she sits besides me, in the computer lab. 

At first our interactions were basically class related comments, but on one occasion during the review of a project, I had the chance to know her with more depth, as the professor was grading each project one by one, asking demonstrations and questions about the code. 

I was very surprised that we were concerned about similar existential topics, as well as fixation related topics, I never imagined that a girl would be interested in hearing about prog rock and audiophile headphones, I don't know whether she was interested in the topic itself or the metaphysics behind them. 

Although it was externally visible that both of us are very introverted, I would never imagine to have so much in common, and to ever feel that I actually enjoy having a conversation with a woman, since most of the times I feel awkward and false, and I feel a disgust afterwards for portraying a fake character that I hate, but with her I could be myself at a certain degree, and have a conversation that was valuable in itself even if I had no attraction towards her. 

I was deeply saddened that I didn't talk to her earlier, by that time there was only around one month left (2 times per week), I tried to keep the rhythm but given time and  stress constraints it was not always possible. 

On the last day of class before the final exams (in this case the grading of a project that counts as the final assignment instead of a final test) I confessed that I have a deep appreciation towards her I find hard to articulate, and asked her if she would like to drink some cofee and walk around the campus to release streess from the projects and exams. 

She told me she couldn't on Wednesday (the day of the test) but she would on Friday (a day were I didn't had any test in the morning, but I proposed as an alternative, it would mean for me waking up early and having to stay at the university all day, but a sacrifice that it's worth the price). 

The day arrived I was very nervous but managed to calm down, eventually I receive her message indicating that she has finished her test (around 8:45 am) asking where can we meet, she greets me with a hug and we sit on a chair, then we give a brief walk and go purchase some coffee, then we sat near an artificial lagoon with a fountain, a silent and intimate place, where we talked for around an hour and a half. 

Somehow existential philosophy was brought into the conversation and I directed it towards religion explaining how Christianity is the solution of a nihilistic society driven by chaos and confusion, how the Catholic Church offers that spiritual refuge, and provides relief from the utter suffering of this world. 

Sharing not a nerdy but a very personal, a very intimate side of me that I had never showed to anyone else before, as if I was discovering a humanity that was there all the time but was sleep. 

It wasn't just that I never imagined to talk about my fixations on a date much less religion, Catholicism, but the fact that I was somehow putting into practice doing the Lord's work as well as expressing into concrete words my inner world, the fact that she despite being agnostic was very engaged and I somehow had a very spiritual moment of humility and love not towards her in a romantic sense, but a mystical contemplative love of loving and willing the good of the other, something trascendent of any particular romantic selfish interest. 

During our conversation I also made her the confession that I am autistic, she replied that she already suspected and that she might also had some traits but ultimately never know. 

We talked for a very long time while we contemplated the beauty of creation by having some silence to slow down and look at the beauty of the world around us. 

Unfortunately we couldn't spent more time together as the time ran out, hours felt like minutes, but at the same time a glimpse of eternity. 

I accompanied her to the bus station, we continue talking while we were on the go. 

Then we say each other goodbye with a hug, and waiting to see us next year, or maybe a couple of times in the meantime. 

I was left there returning to the campus, but I took a different street, and I had the impulse to enter a Church to pray the rosary in a small chapel and wait for Mass, where the priest sermon was deeply touching and almost felt like it was too much coincidence that I was talking about the same topics around an hour ago. 

I know this is very unconventional, I just wanted to share this story with you, if you find it useful. 

Overall, my advice is do not care, forget everything, forget all the rules, is not worth it, if you can't be true to yourself it's not worth it, I practically did everything that was meant not to do on a date and still succeed, although the conditions were optimal, I still consider that it is important to be free, to let you be yourself. 

In my case I never actually learned how to mask, hence the only way of doing things it was my way, because otherwise I would just be a terrible actor living a shallow existence sacrificing for nothing. 

If I keep playing the rules then I would absolutely have nothing to offer...

1oye5ga,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/1oye5ga/i_had_my_first_date_ever/,I had my first date ever,"I want to share the story about my first date ever that I recently had this Friday 

I asked a girl from my university, to drink some coffee and walk around the campus, after final exams, I had the courage to do it because I have few to none chances of seeing her again (not actually, currently the possibilities of coinciding again in another class are much higher, but I didn't knew it back then), so I asked her out. She agreed. 

After all we have a lot in common, the first time I saw her, I had an interest in her, but we barely talked the previous semester. 

On both occasions I was repeating classes that I lost, but in this semester I had to my advantage the fact that she sits besides me, in the computer lab. 

At first our interactions were basically class related comments, but on one occasion during the review of a project, I had the chance to know her with more depth, as the professor was grading each project one by one, asking demonstrations and questions about the code. 

I was very surprised that we were concerned about similar existential topics, as well as fixation related topics, I never imagined that a girl would be interested in hearing about prog rock and audiophile headphones, I don't know whether she was interested in the topic itself or the metaphysics behind them. 

Although it was externally visible that both of us are very introverted, I would never imagine to have so much in common, and to ever feel that I actually enjoy having a conversation with a woman, since most of the times I feel awkward and false, and I feel a disgust afterwards for portraying a fake character that I hate, but with her I could be myself at a certain degree, and have a conversation that was valuable in itself even if I had no attraction towards her.

1oye53q,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1oye53q/i_think_schizophrenia_made_me_do_this_visual/,I think schizophrenia made me do this (visual musical story ),"On my Facebook, when I had strong feelings about something or someone, I felt an urge to share a song that expressed my feelings, often accompanied by a video. As long as I managed to express what I had inside me, I felt satisfied and it allowed me to build a story.

One day, while visiting my hometown, I briefly met a girl whom I didn’t see again for years. Several years passed until one day I saw her on Facebook, and after exploring her personality a bit, I decided to try starting a conversation.

At first it went well, but later I realized she had gone through a heartbreak and was still dealing with those feelings. I kept trying to talk, we exchanged some songs, but at one impulsive and immature moment I tried too hard to push for an in-person coffee, and she didn’t like that, so she decided to cut off the conversation.

I really liked this girl, so my solution was to try building a musical story on my fb to see if I could recover the initial moment and try again. I kept searching until I found the song and video that I felt expressed things well. I did **not** have schizophrenia at that time.

After some time, when I felt the need to do it , sometimes I would hear my inner voice / my own thought telling me the name of a song or a band where I might find something. They weren’t subconscious memories, because most of the names that came weren’t from groups or songs I knew. Sometimes they were perfect hits, other times I had to search because, for example, only ‘Sebastian’ would come to mind and another word was missing. But the truth is that I always found a song that fit with the previous ones and with the symbols of the story I was trying to tell her.

After a while, I began to notice that the songs themselves seemed to be trying to explain the process to me in their music videos and even in some of the lyrics.

It was only about a year after this process started that I began to have symptoms of schizophrenia. In the first years I only heard the neighbors as if they were shouting things at me from their balconies, as if I were on a reality show.

After some years and other loves, the schizophrenia symptoms worsened and I started hearing 4 to 6 voices, always the same ones, 24/7, but internally in my mind, with the same attitude as the voices I had heard in the neighbors trying to make me believe I was in a reality show.

The voices stopped for three years, and it was during that time that something clicked: I realized I had gone through a years-long episode of schizophrenia.

I had other crushes and never stopped posting songs on Facebook, which sometimes also carried the meaning of that process I wanted everyone visiting my Facebook to understand. Meanwhile, the voices returned almost five years ago, the neighbors voices and half a dozen internal ones — and it has been more difficult.

They don’t like me calling the process ‘intuition.’

I leave you a summary in a playlist of 25 songs I put together so that people who didn’t see it live on Facebook can try to understand the process.

It has to be seen like a movie i promise that, among all my different and strange thoughts, it will make sense and show something special, whether it’s my imagination or not.

I can't for the life of me even remember when or how I purchased this.. it had to come in a box or possibly a blind Easter/summer sale purchase? 

Anyway, I was disgusted by this at first. I remember when I first used it, the smell of it wet made me *GAG* ! Flash forward to a few months later, and it weirdly might be one of my favorite products. The smell just grew on me. But most importantly, the way it makes me skin feel! I can't stand that dry/squeaky feeling you get on your skin from bar soap. Ever since I was a kid, it was always a bad sensory trigger. Somewhere down the line, I took this out of my shower and started using it as a hand soap. The coffee scrub makes me feel like I'm using that HEAVY duty Uline soap that you find common with engineers and mechanics. It makes my skin smell suppperr fresh, and soft like a babies butt . Now that's it's almost gone, I'm starting to realize how much I actually enjoyed it, after nearly throwing it away. 

Do you have any products you disliked at first, and then ended up being a staple?

1oye2kf,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oye2kf,Random encounter or planned one? I saw A ( Childhood friend ni Ex na Cheater ),"For Context:

Birthday ng brother ko tomorrow so dito sa campsite kami magse-celebrate following his plan.  I arrived 2 hrs early para ma set-up  ko yung surprise ko sa kanyang air villa tent with airbed.

I ask kuya to grab coffee for me para mas madami akong time. Medyo struggle ako sa pag-setup kasi mabigat yung tent and i use manual air pump.

I rest for a while and grab  my phone to check the time and baka on the way na din sila kuya. I start pumping air like crazy para mabuo ko na before pa sila dumating.

Imagine me sitting on the grass, tired and helpless. Then I saw in my peripheral view that someone was approaching. Si A 😳i adjust my shade pa nga kasi di ako makapaniwala.  May dalang camping chair and bottled water. Muntik ko na yakapin sa tuwa ko, nakapagpigil naman ako kasi nakakahiya. Tska pawisan ako kaka figure out. Pano ko mapapabilis yung pag set-up  ng tent. I look kawawa siguro kaya he extends his hand para tulungan ako makatayo.

He ask me to seat sa camping chair and inabutan ng bottled water. Tulala pa din ako at this moment ahahaha. Ganda ng ngiti nya eh, yung ngiting mapang-asar. He told me chill ka muna dyan, let me help you fix the tent. Umalis sya sandali,  pagbalik nya may dala syang  portable fan itinutok  nya sa sakin at  Auto-air pump.

10 mins lang na set-up na yung tent namin pati airbed. Nag thank you ako sa kanya and he jokingly told me. Anong thank you?  inblock mo na ako add friend mo na din please. I said okay, pero later na aayusin ko muna yung table para sa food na dala ng parents ko.

Pabalik na sya sa tent nya nung pagdating naman ng parents ko. As usual kasama ang 3 dogs na makukulit pero naka leash naman. Playful Tudor tinalunan si A na para bang kilala nya at gustong magpabuhat. Saway saway ni Dad si patek pero nabuhat na ni A. Tapos yung kuya ko na may Birthday kinamayan si A at tinapik sa balikan na para bang matagal na silang magkakilala. Strange 😳

 A even said Advance happy birthday bro! Pinakilala sa parents ko and kuya said kilala mo naman na si E diba? my youngest sister. A just smile and said i saw her struggling kaya tinulungan ko na mag set-up. Panalo tong tent mo bro may automatic air pump kalang pwede mo na iwan. Tinuro yung ford explorer sa unahan sa kuya nya pala tent yung naka set-up doon.

Maya-maya nagpaalam na si A at bumalik sa tent nya. Kami naman nag prep na ng table, wait na lang namin ibaba yung food na tinake-out nila kuya. Sobrang gutom ko yung sandwich at coffee 10mins lang naubos ko na. Bumalik si A inabutan ako ng 2  croissant hahaha kita nya siguro gutom na gutom ako. Natatawa pa sya sabi sakin dahan baka ma choke ka.

A few weeks ago I noticed the intern was messaging him on Facebook late at night and I asked him about it. He told me he had asked her something work related and she was just replying. I shrugged it off but it was kind of eating at me recently because this is the only coworker I don’t know. So I read their messages. Not proud of it. He lied, she wasn’t replying to him. 

Messages consisted of sending her funny videos (that he was also sending me), concert flyers, one of these was even sent to her on my birthday after we got home from dinner. He would text her about coffee but in baby talk? Offered to buy her coffee. She is 13 years younger than him. She would be texting him personally when she was running late opposed to the work group chat? One excuse was that she drank too much the night before and replied “amateur” with an eye roll emoji. He would ask if she was going to be in today. He was telling her about a very very personal family matter. I scrolled to the top and saw that the he had been the one to initiate private dming but it was deleted. Her reply was friendly but he conveniently doesn’t remember what he said to her. Something along of the lines of comforting her because he knows how it feels to be an intern?? 

I have already confronted him and asked him what’s up with the baby talk because that’s what honestly stuck out to me the most. I told him how this friendship is incredibly inappropriate. He said he was just trying to be nice but was this teetering flirting? Did i catch it before i turned into more? Am I overreacting? TIA ",2,1763272618.0,Marriage,3,1.0,False

They brew one cup at a time, ensuring freshness. But what makes one model better than the other? Exploring key features can help you decide. Consider brew quality, speed and convenience, size and design, and ease of cleaning. Each feature plays a role in your daily coffee experience.

# Brew Quality

**Brew quality** is a top priority for many coffee enthusiasts. The right single serve coffee maker should deliver a rich and flavorful cup. Several factors influence brew quality:

* **Temperature Control:** The machine must heat water to the right temperature.
* **Pressure:** Adequate pressure ensures proper extraction of flavors.
* **Water Quality:** Clean water significantly affects the taste of your coffee.

Some machines use pods or capsules for brewing. These are pre-measured and sealed for freshness. Others use ground coffee, offering more control over strength and flavor. Look for models with **adjustable settings**. This allows you to customize your brew.

For the best taste, consider the type of coffee you enjoy. Machines that support multiple brew sizes and types provide more flexibility. Whether you like espresso or a regular cup, brew quality matters.

# Speed And Convenience

Consider models with a **removable water reservoir**. This makes refilling easy and less frequent. A large reservoir means more cups before needing a refill. Also, check for automatic shut-off features. This saves energy and adds safety.

I hate to admit that the nights feel empty without him around. Thankfully I'm on a deal right now, so the nights are blissfully short, otherwise I'd be a basket case. He was still perfect for filling in those idle gaps though. For a laugh, a coffee, a dinner, a quick fuck. 

We used to laugh that he was the perfect accessory for a finance girlie like me. Like a stylish day bag. There when you needed it, able to be swapped out in a moment's notice.

1oydxvg,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1oydxvg/aitah_for_breaking_up_because_hes_not_stable_and/,AITAH for breaking up because he’s not stable and romantic ?,"I broke up with my (19F) boyfriend (21M) because he doesn’t treat me right but i didn’t want to.

So we have been dating for about 7 months.
He had really bad trust issues and didn’t believe me most of the time and then just jumped to conclusions which made me drained. We had so many arguments. I was very calm though and tried to maintain peace and give him time because we all have our own issues.
Now,I’m a student and he has a job.He gives about 80% of his money to his parents but he lives with them so he basically doesnt have bills and groceries etc. I on the other hand don’t have a job and my mother supports me financially. 
He sleeps over almost 5 days of the week and then 2 days at his parents. I cook for him, do laundry and everything. I pay for coffee dates sometimes little things he needs and he’s short on money. And i was okay with that(which is my fault). Basically he never paid for anything maybe once or twice for our food.

However, I believed that he would get on his feet since he’s very young.The emotional distress what what was getting me. Not feeling cared for,him being arrogant yet so protective of me. He showed me love then the other second he didn’t trust me. He was there for me through everything I’ve been through these months (bad family stuff).

But i felt like i needed some small gestures from time to time to feel loved.Like he could find some money here and there to help me. Or maybe just pick a flower or text me something nice. A card or something i don’t know.

This past month i got very frustrated and stopped being so patient with him. We started arguing and i was blunt with him and talked to him the way he talked to me. Then he started understanding after i had explained and told him thousands of times what he’s doing wrong and why he’s hurting me. I was tired of being blamed of things i didn’t do. 

Then he started becoming caring way more,listening to me, complimenting me and all. But obviously didn’t pay for anything still like even 0,40€ bus tickets. Still I just knew he was
broke and felt so bad making a big deal over that.

My cousin told my aunt about this situation and I come from a really bad background of family matters when it comes to men who do nothing but stress u out,abuse u and the usuals. So my aunt,which is like my second mom got concerned and mad and lectured me for houuurssss. She told me i should raise my standards because im being treated bad and okay i know what she means but i wasn’t ready. And i wanted to wait for him because he’s just now thinking of getting out of his situation.

Anyways i felt bad because she was very serious so i had to talk to him about the break up. And we broke up. He left. I didn’t want to break up. He met me the next day, cried and kept saying he’s sorry and that it’s his current financial situation and he’s just not the romantic type. 

We went out ways and now i just miss him so much. He was my best friend apart everything we had. Im a very complicated person too. I just feel so bad for leaving him for this. He’s young and he hasn’t had the opportunities my family offered me. I just don’t want to be away from him and i don’t know if im thinking wrong because i know that with him like this my future is at risk.But i don’t want to make my aunt (and mom) sad and concerned either.

1oydxoh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oydxoh,Dharamkot with Best Friend,"Took a trip with my best friend and I swear I've never been more satiated by a trip in the mountains. Giving you a brief account to take my itinerary so that you can to do a low-key trip too! 

1) Triund Trail - super beginners friendly, just a 5km walk uphill with a scene to die for, schedule so that you can make it before the sunset, sleep in a night and catch a zillion shooting stars on the mountain top then wait for an even prettier sunrise.

2) Dharamkot Israeli colony- food to relish for if you like western cuisine, don't miss out on smoothies and granola breakfast from Space Out cafe! You'll find super friendly people out of the country great place to be if you like talking to strangers. I randomly saw a poster of a workshop, and I ended up painting with coffee along with 10 complete strangers from Europe, Australia, USA and what not. 

3) Dharamkot Studio - if you are into pottery and clay moulding/ or if you have always wanted to try it, imagine doing it with a mountain view and a the hot chocolate they serve, chef's kiss👌🏼

4) Utopia Hostel - Was there and never wanted to leave, a cozy af place with warm people and two pet doggos running around playing with everyone. 

Pro tip: Do ask around for music jams at night, I went to one at night to a cafe called Once in Nature - imagine a group of foreigners, a guy playing violin, another playing guitar, a woman on a flute, all foreigners with a crazy indian singer on a Harmonium singing kun faya kun and you are sitting with everyone singing at the top of your lungs. If that is not solace idk what is.

1oydxfr,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1oydxfr/i_think_schizophrenia_made_me_do_this_visual/,I think schizophrenia made me do this (visual musical story ),"On my Facebook, when I had strong feelings about something or someone, I felt an urge to share a song that expressed my feelings, often accompanied by a video. As long as I managed to express what I had inside me, I felt satisfied and it allowed me to build a story.

One day, while visiting my hometown, I briefly met a girl whom I didn’t see again for years. Several years passed until one day I saw her on Facebook, and after exploring her personality a bit, I decided to try starting a conversation.

At first it went well, but later I realized she had gone through a heartbreak and was still dealing with those feelings. I kept trying to talk, we exchanged some songs, but at one impulsive and immature moment I tried too hard to push for an in-person coffee, and she didn’t like that, so she decided to cut off the conversation.

I really liked this girl, so my solution was to try building a musical story on my fb to see if I could recover the initial moment and try again. I kept searching until I found the song and video that I felt expressed things well. I did **not** have schizophrenia at that time.

After some time, when I felt the need to do it , sometimes I would hear my inner voice / my own thought telling me the name of a song or a band where I might find something. They weren’t subconscious memories, because most of the names that came weren’t from groups or songs I knew. Sometimes they were perfect hits, other times I had to search because, for example, only ‘Sebastian’ would come to mind and another word was missing. But the truth is that I always found a song that fit with the previous ones and with the symbols of the story I was trying to tell her.

After a while, I began to notice that the songs themselves seemed to be trying to explain the process to me in their music videos and even in some of the lyrics.

It was only about a year after this process started that I began to have symptoms of schizophrenia. In the first years I only heard the neighbors as if they were shouting things at me from their balconies, as if I were on a reality show.

After some years and other loves, the schizophrenia symptoms worsened and I started hearing 4 to 6 voices, always the same ones, 24/7, but internally in my mind, with the same attitude as the voices I had heard in the neighbors trying to make me believe I was in a reality show.

The voices stopped for three years, and it was during that time that something clicked: I realized I had gone through a years-long episode of schizophrenia.

I had other crushes and never stopped posting songs on Facebook, which sometimes also carried the meaning of that process I wanted everyone visiting my Facebook to understand. Meanwhile, the voices returned almost five years ago, the neighbors voices and half a dozen internal ones — and it has been more difficult.

They don’t like me calling the process ‘intuition.’

I leave you a summary in a playlist of 25 songs I put together so that people who didn’t see it live on Facebook can try to understand the process.

1oydvg5,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1oydvg5/the_sacrifices_i_make_for_my_best_friend_day_two/,"The sacrifices I make for my best friend, day two.","This morning, as I woke from my semblance of a wink, my breath was flowing with the grace and freedom of a flower petal. Immediately I could tell that something was.. Off. Not off as in things were out of place; This room is already far too messy and unorganised to tell. Instead it feels just.. That much brighter.. Not enough for concern, it's just that usually when I wake I'm hit with an overbearing sense of dread, It isn't everyday I find myself this well rested.
 I let out a lung of groggy air, feeling around my bedside in search of a cell. I hate to ruin this pleasant calm, but I need to know how many hours until I leave for work. 
My blind tapping fingers come across a sudden glassy chill. Wrapping around the shapes back, they trace along a webbed, pinching protrusion. I raise my phone to eye level, squinting to prepare for its blinding screen. That's when I pressed the power button, and came to the unfortunate realization that; During the excitement of the previous night, I’d forgotten to plug my device into the wall.
At first my heart was screaming with the usual fear of having your ass on the line. I've already left a late track record with the higher ups. In fact I think they've been looking for a reason to fire me as of recently. That's the worst part of being a desk jockey. It's not the monotony of sitting in one space for the majority of your day, and it's not the frustration that comes with nepobaby superiors and their illogical deadlines. It's the simple unrelenting fact that, no matter how long you've been in a position, they can always just give your desk to someone else. 
And you know what really doesn't help? The lack of real connection. Be it between passing peers with porcelain smiles, or out of touch superiors that act like they were born with sticks pre-lodged up their asses.
Here again I rest in a shameful puddle of misfortune. I'd say I don't believe it, but it's just really easy to accept. By now it's safe to claim as my most common mistake, I let myself feel fortunate enough to get comfortable. Every single time I dare to lower my guard, the universe makes a point to put me back in my place. Of course. I don't know why I expected anything to be different. I just never learn.
As a form of necessary, yet late correction, I pop my phone into the wall letting it gain enough strength for at least my commute. Once I get to work I can easily bum a charger off of Amy, maybe even James. Although that'd be a risky prayer to the gods of fortune, and I really don't feel like tempting their wrath more than I already have. 
As the somnambulant fog of my mind clears, I draft a sarcastic greeting toward my creeping sense of loneliness. That's when a giddy tingle of pure elation sparked from my chest. How could I forget? My sweet Eibon is waiting for me in the living room. 
I couldn't help but playfully scoff at the recital of his name. Even just the image of my sweet companion melts away all my waxing dread. Instead it warms my core, waning at the suffocating mental mound. This feeling could only be described as an adrenaline high, it's just this sudden utter lightness. 
After running through my typical routine with a manic speed, just the basics, a nice warm shower followed by the minted sanding of my winding, tinted teeth. I quickly shuffled toward the prominent, black wire cage; perfectly nestled in the corner of our main living space. I called out in a sing-song fashion, “Oh Eibonn, I see you've emptied your bowl. Why don't I get you a nice greasy helping?” Tracing the cage's perimeter, I made myself aware of his equally dry water bottle. 
The light traces of pearly calcium were all that clung to the plastic bottles walls. The air must be especially dry today. I took care of my boy, making sure his most basic needs were met. I kept hoping he'd wink at me again, but I think my stare drenched with anticipation made him uneasy. I have to remember that I only brought him home yesterday. 
I can't force Eibon to be comfortable with my goliath presence. I know all too well that feeling of helplessness, like you're nothing more than a greater force’s plaything. The universe truly is my most consistent source of torment. I wonder if Eibon will end up feeling that same way about me. 
After checking my phone was sufficiently charged, and that the stove along with the faucets were content in wasting without purpose; I sped out the door in a haze of prayer. 
Prayers that today wouldn't be the day I was kicked from the payroll, prayers that ill get to enjoy my afternoon in mental peace; Instead of wallowing in unemployment. I'm getting ahead of myself, I don't even know if they'll fire me. I had called into the office, and was pleasantly reassured that all was well. Unfortunately I don't trust a single word that comes from faceless mouths. I'm more than well aware of their corporate games, and I'll be damned before I let them lull me into a meaningless hope.
As I neared the exit of the complex, the glint from between gaps in the wooden door, accompanied by the overwhelming rays passing through glass panes, gave the impression of light cast from furious hellfire. And as I opened the crackling door, its fibers screaming in twisting compression. The lightest red tint stood present in the general light, but I chalked it up to my eyes adjusting to the ever so bright sun.
It didn't matter what the cause, my mind wouldn't allow me to escape this anxious whirlwind of theoreticals. This constant fear of unemployment is starting to get old. It's not all uncommon for me to get wrap- There was a sudden burst of energy in my shoulder. Quickly turning in panicked disorientation, I noticed a man dressed near entirely in red speeding off from our encounter. 
I tried to shout an apology, but he turned the corner before I knew my left from right. I didn't have the time nor the energy to pursue him. That's when a seeping intrusion drew closer to my chest. Uncomfortably clinging fabric to my skin. 
That bastard spilled his coffee on me. Are you fucking joking? This was a pristine shirt. I couldn't help but laugh, as the sorrow quickly turned to revel in my defeat. He just.. sped off. God that's just hilarious. “You know what? NO! Fuck this noise. I've got better things to do with this shitty life.” 
I hadn't realized I screamed out loud, and suddenly every passing figure was staring in judgement and disgust. Hell, I'd stare too if some disheveled man covered in coffee suddenly began shouting in broad daylight. And In public no less.
Oh man what I would have given for the ground to just swallow up every form of idea in which i reside. Erasing me from the history of earth in both mind and body. If only it was that easy to break yourself from the judging eyes of eternity.
The crowd had now been staring for an inappropriate amount of time. It probably didn't help that in my panic I began a sort of plea. “What? Is it the coffee? You've never seen someone spill coffee or something?!” not a single sound. Even as I strained my ears in caution, all I could hear was each statue's perfectly paced breath.
Their faces all stood motionless, flat in expression. Suddenly my cheeks were burning with embarrassment. “The fuck is your problem?! Quit staring and just move on with your day!” Yet despite my clear despair.. They just stood there like statues. I must look like a total psycho right now.
Surrounded on all sides by eyes, I quickly turned in a brisk walk back toward the complex. It's just too much, I might as well use my sick days now; They'll be wasted once they finally kick my ass to the curb. 
I thought distancing myself from the site of offense would pry me from their maddening eyes. But as I neared my apartment, the gaze of complete strangers burned white spots in my peripheral. I couldn't bear to turn my gaze and confirm. It seemed like they would just drop everything and anything. All so they could stare.
I kept my head down, feeling daggers seep into the back of my head. I wonder if this is how Julius Caesar felt on his final day. Then I saw it, my fortress of solitary relief. I don't think I've ever run so fast in my life. I mean, once that gateway of hope whispered from across the way; All was out the window. 
I can't get those horrifying eyes out of my head. What's more is that things continue to feel.. Misplaced? The hall looks more clean than usual, maybe it's just my headspace; painting this building as some fortress of grace. After that utter insanity, I just can't shake the feeling that everything is in disarray. That there's something I'm not understanding. I think I'm just being ungrateful, it's not often that they pick up the place.
God this feels so stupid to say, but I think I've lost my mind. There's just no other reasonable explanation for what happened outside. Years of mental torment have finally left their mark and I'm now falling to its release. When I started writing in my book it was just to aid in my reflection toward the end of a hard day. I've read plenty online about the healing power of a journal. But now? Now I feel as though I've passed a threshold. One I can never cross again. I hate that I can't make sense of it.
While walking to my floor, I heard the faintest essence of falling rain; dripping up from the lower levels. It's a good thing I was able to take shelter before it hit. Lord knows just how badly I could snap if harassed by fate any further. Finally my haven was in sight, and the first thing I did once entering my apartment was lock the door. Then I just had to call in sick. And wouldn't you know it? Dead. Again! I've been long overdue for an upgrade, but then again; so has my paycheck.
Thank god for landlines. These things are a little scratchy at times, but I could mostly make out what the other line was saying. Even through the distortion, her corporate tone was ever so present. “We’re sorry to hear of your absence, we hope to see you again as soon as possible!” There was more, but my attention was drawn to the tall black cage. Just like flies to rot. Rot.. One of the final steps; followed by our inevitable distribution. How might things be different if we didn't have rot? I guess the world would just be no more than a wet rock. 
“Hello? Are you still there?”
Shit, I couldn't control my stammer “Y-yeah! Sorry I kind of trailed off there for a second.” The bitch replied, her snark tangible in the air. “Righhttt… we just need to know when we can expect you back”
Suddenly a baratone voice echoed, obscured from my immediate view. “They want to get rid of you.”
Liquid fear was dripping down my throat, I paused for a moment. “What?..”
The woman replied, her tone now as if speaking to a child with hearing difficulties. “When? Can we? Expect you back?” 
The hidden voice echoed once more, “Hang up the phone, papa. They don't deserve your voice.”
My head was now frantically swiping left to right, spinning round the room. There's nobody. Not a single soul in sight. 
“I-Im sorry, I have to go.” ” I don't know if she said anything more as I threw the cell back in the receiver. To be frank, I really didn't care. Finding the intruder was top of the list. Rather dreadfully. No, first I need a weapon.
Immediately I sprinted to the kitchen for a blade. All I have is a dull steak knife. Of course. God I’m so fucked. Almost in tears, I spoke aloud; “Where are you?! I called the cops you fucking weirdo! A-And I have a knife! Please.. If you just walk out the front door right now.. We can forget all about this hiccup.” 
The voice replied, clear as day. “I can't leave this cage, papa.” Its booming tone began to break, “Please don't make me go, I love you so much. I thought you would be happy to hear from me.”
“What are you talking about?! What c-cage?!” Please don't do this to me.. Not today! Please!” My legs were now softening to jelly, I wasn't sure how long I'd be able to stay upright. My head feels so light.
It can't be him. Dear god, please. Just don't let it be him.
The voice healed quickly, shifting to what I assumed to be a cheery Facade. “Back here, papa. In the corner. I wished upon a star and now.. Well, just look at me! It's your boy! Eibon!”
I couldn't help but crumble to the ground, tears now anchoring me against the floor. I'm lost. My life is over and things can never be the same again. There's a laugh choking through my tears, I can't believe I'm sobbing like such a baby. I just can't stop, my lungs won't let me catch my breath. 
“Just rest, papa. You've done all you can today. I thought this is what you wanted, I only want to be a good boy”
My head feels like I'm breathing clouds. No matter how hard I force my breath. I never wanted this, dear god why would anyone want this. I'm slipping, sinking deeper and deeper into the ground, I just hope it takes my image too. 
“Goodnight, papa. Rest well, you have much to do, come next morn”
A lot has happened since I woke up, my face crushed into the hardwood floor. I don't know what time it is, none of the clocks in my apartment are set. I guess that's what I get for not keeping up with chores. I never got the chance to plug in my phone, and what's worse is either the outlet isn't working, or my one and only phone cord has finally burnt out.
Me and Eibon.. As insane as it sounds.. We've been talking. At first I was terrified, what's happening goes against nature itself. It isn't right, yet I’ve only fallen more in love. I started off hiding in the corner of my bedroom, too afraid to go outside, and too uncomfortable to face my boy. 
Until he started singing through the wall. A song that my flawed human perception could never catalog. A symphony graced by the gods of our median world. I was lifted by angels, and they whispered things to me. Gracing purpose with soft melodies; scrambling my mind with carefully crafted harmonies. As they pulled me up and down endless scales, ones above what it means to be human; I was gifted purpose. Ghosts of the past, people I used to love. They all worked together to show me what was really important. My sweet Eibon.
There was no reason to be afraid of him, parents give birth to deformed creatures beyond our worst dreams every day. Yet those little monsters are deserving of love all the same. Why is Eibon any different? Short answer, he isn't. He never chose to speak, he didn't pick me from the store. I’m the one who picked him.
Suddenly I didn't need courage in order to leave my bedroom. Now I understood, so I walked out and grabbed a baby carrot from the fridge. My sweet boy chirped, “Is that for me? Oh gosh! I really hope it's for me, papa!”
From there, things only seemed to get better. I'm happy, even more so than yesterday. It's dark outside now, and even though I took a nice nap; the length of which is still unknown to me, I regret to say I tire easily. This absolute mess of a day turned out better than I could have ever hoped. I lay in bed swirling in hope, I can't wait for tomorrow. 

Goodnight Eibon.

I wanted to share some fresh photos of Moon Rock, the first seasoning from Kendu Spice Co.

This community has been with me since the very beginning. None of this could have happened without you. Seriously…thank you.

Moon Rock is officially *real*, the first physical product is in my hand, Amazon logistics are being finalized, and it turned out better than I ever imagined. Coffee-infused, smoky-sweet, balanced, and stupidly good on steak, chicken, veggies, fish, pork, literally everything.

In her recent re-invention, re-introduction video, she talked about someone who was close her moved away and betrayed her. Guess who did move to Mumbai? 
She also made it clear that Sarah Sarosh is a dear friend by promoting her Rage Coffee. 
Another jab at SV was the recent polarizing review on the Anti-norm Serum. 

And the most recent... SV celebrating her Birthday and Jovi not only was not seen in the scene, but she neither liked nor commented. 

And I don't blame her. Jovita's reviews and opinions seem honest and more convincing most of the time. Even though she does seem to push some products than more, she seems to be able to substantiate it better.

I am Team Jovita here and I, at some point lost the plot why she was even associated herself with Shweta Vijay.

SV in one of her recent (less than 2 months back) long form videos justified why she gets more Brands to seek her out and stick to her. 

She seems to blatantly lie sometimes like use a filter or not show how the product actually performed on her. And ofcourse which Beauty brand wouldn't want her by their side, when she's able to go to such lengths to market their products.

1oydups,https://i.redd.it/h7b5pm2wwj1g1.png,The Sniper and the wharf,"I love taut, suspense thrillers and stumbled on The Sniper (1952) recently on Tubi.  The connection with the Grateful Dead is that towards the end of the movie the sniper Eddie, played by Arthur Franz, is being chased, so he flees back to his apartment through the wharves, *way down, down, down by the docks of the city*.  This is before it was redeveloped as the tourist mecca, Fisherman's Wharf.  This is the area where Joe Dimaggio's father was a fisherman.  The still above was captured at about the 80 minute mark.

I liked a lot of things about this movie.  Shot on a low budget there are extensive location shots of the city.  San Francisco in 1952 was not the cultural mecca it later became, it was still a blue collar city of immigrants, more like Milwaukee or Pittsburgh.  There appears to be a Sanborn coffee factory around where the Transamerica Building now stands.  We see street scenes of ordinary San Franciscans going about their daily business and I sometimes think little Jerry might walk by.  He would be about 9 or 10 in 1952?  I don't remember where he lived at that time.  In any event, this is the city that he knew growing up.

I don't dig violence in movies, or violence in general, but the scene where the stunningly beautiful ""scream queen"" Marie Windsor is shot coming out of the Paper Doll night club is sudden and shocking.  We hear the crack of the rifle and she is plastered against a glass case featuring a poster of her, ""Performing Nightly.""  The Paper Doll is purportedly the first (openly) gay bar in the country.  There is a scene inside the club, though not with its usual clientele.

This was one of Stanley Kramer's first productions.  He was known for making movies with a ""social conscience.""  With the advent of television, Hollywood was taking a hit and renting out its unused studio space at low rates.  So combined with location shooting, the blacklisted director Edward Dmytryk, and no major stars, he was able to make it on a shoestring.  When Adolphe Menjou, well known for his conservative political views, was asked why he agreed to work with Dmytryk, a member of the Hollywood Ten, he said, ""because I'm a whore.""

Finally, I want to mention ""Dirty Harry"" made twenty years later and directed by Don Siegel.  Siegel must have had this film in mind, they were both shot in San Francisco, and both open with the shooter fixing a woman in the crosshairs.  But in every other way Siegel's film is the inverse of this one.  In ""Dirty Harry"", the shooter is barely seen, while we follow Eddie everywhere.  Siegel's shooter is an unspeakable monster, while Eddie is cast as a misunderstood victim.  It's hinted that he's a war veteran and was likely abused by his mother.  Eddie knows he's messed up and tries to seek help, but in 1952 there were no mental health services, unless you did time in prison.",2,1763272175.0,gratefuldead,1,1.0,False

1oydrut,https://www.reddit.com/r/ARTIST/comments/1oydrut/i_think_schizophrenia_made_me_do_this_visual/,I think schizophrenia made me do this (visual musical story ),"On my Facebook, when I had strong feelings about something or someone, I felt an urge to share a song that expressed my feelings, often accompanied by a video. As long as I managed to express what I had inside me, I felt satisfied and it allowed me to build a story.

One day, while visiting my hometown, I briefly met a girl whom I didn’t see again for years. Several years passed until one day I saw her on Facebook, and after exploring her personality a bit, I decided to try starting a conversation.

At first it went well, but later I realized she had gone through a heartbreak and was still dealing with those feelings. I kept trying to talk, we exchanged some songs, but at one impulsive and immature moment I tried too hard to push for an in-person coffee, and she didn’t like that, so she decided to cut off the conversation.

I really liked this girl, so my solution was to try building a musical story on my fb to see if I could recover the initial moment and try again. I kept searching until I found the song and video that I felt expressed things well. I did **not** have schizophrenia at that time.

After some time, when I felt the need to do it , sometimes I would hear my inner voice / my own thought telling me the name of a song or a band where I might find something. They weren’t subconscious memories, because most of the names that came weren’t from groups or songs I knew. Sometimes they were perfect hits, other times I had to search because, for example, only ‘Sebastian’ would come to mind and another word was missing. But the truth is that I always found a song that fit with the previous ones and with the symbols of the story I was trying to tell her.

After a while, I began to notice that the songs themselves seemed to be trying to explain the process to me in their music videos and even in some of the lyrics.

It was only about a year after this process started that I began to have symptoms of schizophrenia. In the first years I only heard the neighbors as if they were shouting things at me from their balconies, as if I were on a reality show.

After some years and other loves, the schizophrenia symptoms worsened and I started hearing 4 to 6 voices, always the same ones, 24/7, but internally in my mind, with the same attitude as the voices I had heard in the neighbors trying to make me believe I was in a reality show.

The voices stopped for three years, and it was during that time that something clicked: I realized I had gone through a years-long episode of schizophrenia.

I had other crushes and never stopped posting songs on Facebook, which sometimes also carried the meaning of that process I wanted everyone visiting my Facebook to understand. Meanwhile, the voices returned almost five years ago, the neighbors voices and half a dozen internal ones — and it has been more difficult.

They don’t like me calling the process ‘intuition.’

I leave you a summary in a playlist of 25 songs I put together so that people who didn’t see it live on Facebook can try to understand the process.

It has to be seen like a movie i promise that, among all my different thoughts, it will make sense and show something special, whether it’s my imagination or not.

I  had to stop coffee for the most part as i found i was getting a bit of a racey heart if i had both - especially at the gym (or maybe just more cognizant of it too), and its been about 2 weeks now of limited coffee which has been great post the withdrawal headaches. I find i still have a crash in the afternoon at work and have been supplementing with half a dex (its only a 5mg tablet) but after a little bit this effect wears off. Is it typical for the latency to wear away? I have been trialling the full 5mg on the weekend without the vyvanse but do find it wears off quickly as well and without the vyvanse not sure how much of an effect it has. I find i can stomach food on vyvanse much better but struggle with the dex. 
Pyschiatrist is happy for me to supplement a whole dex as both my doses are still quite low but struggling with the thoughts of just medicating heaps. Would love to see how rest of you navigate? 
Also struggling with headaches in the early evening - i do drink heaps of water (i carry about like a 1.2L emotional supprt stanley cup lol and it does get refilled a bit) but unsure if this is normal or i should be drinking more/something else?

1oydqep,https://www.reddit.com/r/creatorcartel/comments/1oydqep/do_you_know_that_feeling_of_loneliness/,Do you know that feeling of loneliness?,"Not the ""I haven't talked to anyone in forever"" kind. The other kind. The kind that hits after you've been loud all day, talking, performing, being online - always, and then you finally shut down your computer and there's this indescribable, crushing silence.

I know exactly how that feels and I tried to ignore it for a long time. Worked more instead. Stayed busier. I tired to fill every single minute with noise, even if it was just a podcast, music or the TV. Then in my early 20s, I ended up in a clinic with severe depression.

And here's the thing, I had friends who called me, even visited. But there was still this insane loneliness. Because I felt like nobody actually understood. Nobody could really feel what I was going through.

Since then, I've been extremely open about depression, about my illness, about all of it. Not for attention. But to show understanding. To help others with that feeling.

So lately I've been thinking a lot about isolation, the loneliness in this industry, in our industry. I wanted to talk about it, address it directly, see how many people actually feel it.

**This specific, suffocating type of loneliness that is more common than one would think.**

You finish a great shift. Good money. Fun conversations. Everything went well… Or it was super bad, empty room, no tips… And the moment you shut down your computer – silence. Heavy silence that takes over everything and suddenly feels so loud it screams at you.

It’s almost weird to feel this way, after speaking to people all day long.

But actually, it's not weird at all. There's even science on it: you can be surrounded by interaction and still be drowning in loneliness because you’re creating an experience for someone else. **No matter** **how you feel inside.** But what protects your mental health isn't how much you talk to people. It's whether you feel connected to something real. To the world. To yourself. Not just performing for others all day.

**Today, I actually enjoy being alone.**

It took work to get here and it wasn't easy but here's what helped me and I hope that it helps some of you too:

1. **I changed the story I told myself.** I started telling myself ""I like being alone. I like watching what I want, cooking what I like."" Even when I didn't feel it yet. I just kept saying it until my brain started believing it.
2. **I created small moments that felt good.** Whenever I had time, even just half a day, I did things I actually enjoy. Went on hikes with my dog. The first time I went to a coffee shop alone? Hard. In fact, super hard – I walked around the café two times before I went in. But the next time was easier. And easier. Until it was normal. I brought a book, read the news, people-watched. Went window shopping. Small things that I enjoy.
3. **I started planning my time, even the simple things.** Structuring my days made solitude feel *chosen*, not accidental. I plan my days now, even if it's just a movie night. I make myself look forward to it.

It's not easy at first. But it gets easier.

Because your brain learns through repetition, emotional exposure, and small proofs of safety. Feeling comfortable alone isn't a personality trait, it's a practiced skill. You teach your mind that solitude isn't a threat. It's a space that can actually feel good.

**Being alone and feeling lonely are two completely different things.**

And I know it's harder in this industry. Most people have coworkers. Someone to vent to about a difficult client. Someone who just gets it.

Working alone all day, every day and night? Whether you have people in your life or not? That's not easy.

**Why this matters?**

Learning to be comfortable alone isn't about giving up on connection. It's about building a foundation so you're not drowning in loneliness while you figure out the rest. Because reconnecting to the world, actually finding people you can be real with, building friendships that aren't based on performance, that takes time. And it's hard. Really hard. But you can't reach out from a place of desperation. You have to start by being okay with yourself, with the quiet. Then you can start building connections that actually feel real.

It starts with you and the silence making peace with each other.

I've been open about my journey because I know what it's like to feel like nobody understands. And I've watched what isolation does when people carry it alone.

Hi people!

A couple of weeks ago I posted here my little stupid story of the link. I'm in love with a friend and I asked for advices. 

A lot of people answered me and asked me to update.

It is going probably in the worst way possible. 

So.

I decided to talk to him. 
I decided what to say, how to say it, where to say it. I was really ready. Scared, anxious, worried... but at the end of the day I thought that I deserved to know. To let go and in case make space in my heart for someone else. 

Well, day after he told me that a female friend was coming into town to visit him. At the beginning I didn't care too much, I have a lot of male friends. 

He said that she was going to come with us in some things that we organized, I wasn't happy about that but fine. 

The first days were fine. They behaved like friends and he was behaving with me as usual. So I just thought to talk to him when she was gone,  she was supposed to stay here only 5 days. I rent a room in my house and she came there. So she wasn't staying with him (but he lives in a very alternative way so don't know).

She decided to stay longer. 

She stayed two weeks.

Well.

As I said, first days, all good, all normal. We hanged out the three of us. He was more focused on me than on her. All normal. 

I work. He isn't working at the moment and she was here on holidays so they had a lot of free time to pass together. I work, so I met them in the evenings or some afternoons.

One day, I don't know what the hell happened, it started to feel different. 

It was weekend, we passed a day together the three of us and he was super focused on her. And she started to touch him, laugh in a weird way, interrupt me while I was talking. He looked only at her at the dinner table. I felt so weird, I wanted to go home. And this thing became more and more. She decided to stay more. 

They started to text all the time and when I was passing by she was hiding the chat (like I'm an idiot). She told me that she was going to do things alone and then I found out that she was with him. 

We were all together, I greeted them goodbye, everyone went in a different direction and after one hour they were together again. 

He asked me out for coffee and after a couple of hours she arrived. He asked me out for drinks and he told me ""she is in your house, why you didn't invite her?"".

Well... things like these. It was pure torture. I was seeing them becoming closer and closer in front of my eyes. Closer and closer. Why I didn't walk away? I don't know. I have no idea. I stayed and I saw this happening in front of my eyes.

Yesterday evening we went to a party, with other people. 

We greeted all goodbye. 

He hugged everyone, except me. He was a bit cold. Usually he greets me with a kiss on the cheek and a beautiful hug. I tried to hug him and he didn't hug me back properly. He did it just because I did it. 

And then he greeted her. And the way he greeted her broke my heart. They stayed in this long hug, he caressed her face. He was very sweet to her. 

Now, I'm old enough to understand what is going on here. She was his friend, in these two weeks they passed a lot of time together, she was behaving in a certain seducing way, they became closer probably something happened between them. Perhaps she is more seducing and less shy than me. 

What to do now?

I'm extremely sad. 
I cried all night.

Tomorrow she will go away. Hopefully. 

I don't know what to feel. 

He texted me a couple of times in these two weeks 'Are you ok?"" ""You had a dark shadow in your face today, is it all good?"". I answered that there was something bit I would have preferred to talk to him in person. Then I didn't because I didn't want her to show up in the middle of the conversation. He has tried to ask, I changed topic. 

But now she will go away. 

I don't even know what to tell him anymore. I don't want to not tell anything also because he asked (really?? He didn't get it??????)

Doesn't make sense anymore to tell him ""We pass a lot of nice time together, we do a lot of stuff, we had a lot in common and I thought that our friendship can me something more, have you ever thought about that?"" ""I think that I'm a bit in love with you, how are you feeling about that?"".

Doesn't make sense anymore. 

Even if their relationship doesn't have anything to do with our relationship. 

My heart is broken, again. 

What would you do at my place?

I just want to stop loving me and despite all this it doesn't stop. Horrible and stupid. 

I think about how he behaved me until last week and I'm so sad. He always for example stand up to greet me when I entered in a place, he doesn't do it anymore. As I said, he doesn't hug anymore. Doesn't blow me kisses anymore. Etcetera. How can a person change so much in ten days??

1oydoyc,https://www.reddit.com/r/SchizophreniaArtProj/comments/1oydoyc/dunno_if_this_count_as_art/,Dunno if this count as art !,"On my Facebook, when I had strong feelings about something or someone, I felt an urge to share a song that expressed my feelings, often accompanied by a video. As long as I managed to express what I had inside me, I felt satisfied and it allowed me to build a story.

One day, while visiting my hometown, I briefly met a girl whom I didn’t see again for years. Several years passed until one day I saw her on Facebook, and after exploring her personality a bit, I decided to try starting a conversation.

At first it went well, but later I realized she had gone through a heartbreak and was still dealing with those feelings. I kept trying to talk, we exchanged some songs, but at one impulsive and immature moment I tried too hard to push for an in-person coffee, and she didn’t like that, so she decided to cut off the conversation.

I really liked this girl, so my solution was to try building a musical story on my fb to see if I could recover the initial moment and try again. I kept searching until I found the song and video that I felt expressed things well. I did **not** have schizophrenia at that time.

After some time, when I felt the need to do it , sometimes I would hear my inner voice / my own thought telling me the name of a song or a band where I might find something. They weren’t subconscious memories, because most of the names that came weren’t from groups or songs I knew. Sometimes they were perfect hits, other times I had to search because, for example, only ‘Sebastian’ would come to mind and another word was missing. But the truth is that I always found a song that fit with the previous ones and with the symbols of the story I was trying to tell her.

After a while, I began to notice that the songs themselves seemed to be trying to explain the process to me in their music videos and even in some of the lyrics.

It was only about a year after this process started that I began to have symptoms of schizophrenia. In the first years I only heard the neighbors as if they were shouting things at me from their balconies, as if I were on a reality show.

After some years and other loves, the schizophrenia symptoms worsened and I started hearing 4 to 6 voices, always the same ones, 24/7, but internally in my mind, with the same attitude as the voices I had heard in the neighbors trying to make me believe I was in a reality show.

The voices stopped for three years, and it was during that time that something clicked: I realized I had gone through a years-long episode of schizophrenia.

I had other crushes and never stopped posting songs on Facebook, which sometimes also carried the meaning of that process I wanted everyone visiting my Facebook to understand. Meanwhile, the voices returned almost five years ago, the neighbors voices and half a dozen internal ones — and it has been more difficult.

They don’t like me calling the process ‘intuition.’

I leave you a summary in a playlist of 25 songs I put together so that people who didn’t see it live on Facebook can try to understand the process.

It has to be seen like a movie i promise that, among all my different thoughts, it will make sense and show something special, whether it’s my imagination or not.

56 hits in a row. .406 batting average. The 1941 season is one of the most iconic statistically in MLB history. But despite the narrative of the American League season being the duel between Joe DiMaggio and Ted Williams and their chases of baseball immortality, another, decidedly less famous player hit the summit of his own career. And despite Ted and Joe's amazing accomplishments, it was Cecil Travis who took home the AL hit title, clocking in with 25 more hits than DiMaggio and 33 more than Williams. 

#Early Years

Coming out of high school already sought after for his bat, Cecil Travis aced the first test posed by minor league baseball. From 1931 - 1933, starting at age 17, Travis hit .356 for the Chattanooga Lookouts. By age 19, all he needed was an opening to make his Major League debut. The Lookouts were a farm team to the Washington Senators, who had not quite yet hit the historical futility recorded by Terry Cashman. Indeed, from 1930 to 1932, the Senators topped 90 wins every season, but pennants evaded them year after year. With a hall of very gooder in Buddy Myer manning second base, and future hall of famers Joe Cronin, Goose Goslin and Heinie Manush manning shortstop and the corner outfield spots, there was only one possible opening for Travis- and that was at third, where team vet and popular defensive star Ossie Bluege stood. 

An injury to Bluege gave the 19 year old Travis a chance at a cup of coffee in May 1933. Pulled up, Travis' first game ever was one for the ages, picking up five hits and scoring three runs in an extra-innings win- the youngest player to ever have 5 hits in a game. But this would be no Lou Gehrig and Wally Pipp story- for the next week, Travis hit .182 and returned to Chattanooga with Bluege's return. Travis would return to the majors in September as a pinch hitter, but was not part of the Senators World Series roster. He ended his first cup of coffee with an average over .300 though- something he'll get used to at the MLB level. 

Come 1934, the Senators wanted to get their 20 year old young star into the lineup SOMEHOW, and the third base job became his. A sizzling hot start to the season was only interrupted by his career's first serious threat. After a fastball nailed him in the head, Travis collapsed unconscious. In what was maybe a lucky break, Travis only missed a week recovering from a concussion, finishing out the season. Despite hitting .391 as late as mid-June, Travis dipped down the stretch, ending the year at .319. The Senators themselves imploded spectacularly, finishing 33 games worse than they did the previous season, beginning the road to irrelevance.

As for his batting style, Travis was the stereotypical ""pure hitter."" He didn't walk a lot, he didn't have power, he didn't run on the base-paths, but he just hit, smoking his line drives all day. Frankly, for most of his career with his profile... he's Luis Arraez. 

1935 arrived, and Travis found himself in much the same position. A young, talented, 21 year old third basemen on a team that was painfully imploding. There weren't really any dramatic ups and downs in this season- he came in second on the Senators in WAR, only behind batting title winner Buddy Myer, and began his seven year streak of having more walks than strike-outs in a season- a ratio of 41 to 28. Travis ended the year hitting .318 without as much as a single home run- still slap hitting all day.

1936 saw something different. Not offensively. Travis hit .317 with the same offensive profile as the years before. No, this time, Travis was moved all around the diamond. The Senators of 1936 were far, far different than the stacked line up of 1933. Goslin, Cronin and Manush were gone. Buddy Myer missed large portions of the season with a stomach illness. Young Buddy Lewis took over third, and Travis played... 69 games at shortstop, a new spot and 46 at right field. Throw in a smattering of appearances at left, second and third, and you have a guy with no real home. He was no ace with a glove- the Senators just felt as if they HAD to have his bat.

#Prime Years

1937, and Cecil Travis' moving days were done. Settling in at shortstop all season, Travis had the finest year of his career so far. Leading the Senators in WAR (of course, a stat super valued in the 1930's), Travis also hit .344 on the season- 5th in the league, only behind bona fide all timers named Gehringer, DiMaggio, Gehrig and Zeke Bonura. But as things tended to go with Cecil Travis, things didn't start smoothly. Starting the season with a broken ankle, he didn't lock into regular playing time until late May. And even then he dazzled- Travis hit in the .380s until August, before he ran into a late season dip once more and couldn't take home that vaunted batting crown. The Senators however... remained mediocre, despite any heroics. For his efforts, Travis placed 11th in AL MVP voting at the end of the season.

1938 was much the same. Managing shortstop well enough yet again, Travis hit .335 and again placed 5th in the American League. Travis also really filled up the stat sheet by setting a career high in steals (six) and his highest homer total so far (five). He was rewarded with his first ever all-star nod, placing second in the shortstop vote- but his predecessor as Senators shortstop, Joe Cronin, was the AL starter. He placed ninth in the AL in MVP voting at the end of the year, one spot over his own self-declared idol and favorite player- Tigers star Charlie Gehringer. And speaking of the Tigers, they wanted Travis. Badly. And the whole world knew it. Late 1938, rumblings of Travis going to Detroit were abound, to the point you had comics in local Washington newspapers lampooning the deal. Travis' SABR bio claims that a Travis for Greenberg swap was in the works... but no. A more substantiated rumor had him going to Detroit in exchange for Rudy York, but Greenberg blocked his own friend from going to Washington. Travis is here for the long haul.

Heading into the 1939 season, Travis was still ""only"" 25, and he was just hitting his stride. What better way to start the season than confined to his bedroom with the flu (or maybe just a ""bronchial ailment)? Travis would catch the flu twice that year, and was down in the dumps when he did play, struggling to hit .240 for most of the first half. For once, Travis' level picked up when the season struck July 1st, getting over the flu to hit a much more in character .327- but for the first time in his professional career, he hit under .300 for a season, falling in at .292. Already thin, the early bouts with the flu really sapped Travis- his SABR bio citing him as losing ""considerable"" weight. But as the end of the year showed, he had bounced back. And despite his struggles, he was still beloved in Washington. Per the certainly unbiased Cecil Travis Girls' Club, not only was he the best shortstop in the world, but he was also cute. And those two reasons are more than enough to justify not trading him- not for DiMaggio, not for Bill Dickey, not for Dizzy Dean, and certainly not for whatever player the Tigers toss up this year. The battle between these high school girls defending Travis' performance and the newspaper bring up trading him would last until the trading deadline that season, but again, he stayed put. 

1940 saw Travis move positions once again. Buddy Lewis went to the outfield, and Travis went right back to third base. At the risk of sounding repetitive, his level was back to it's previous form- even if he only hit .322 this season, Travis set career highs in doubles and triples, with 37 and 11, as well as the top OPS+ of his career so far. Picking up a second all-star game and some down-ballot MVP votes, he seemed what he was.

#1941: The Peak

Heading into 1941, Cecil Travis shook things up. Only aged 27, this is still the time to find your best version. Why not step back in the batter's box? Why not pick up a heavier bat? Why not change up the grip? The result was his very best version. In a season defined by Ted Williams and Joe DiMaggio, Travis slid right under the radar. The same day that DiMaggio's streak ended? Travis' own, much smaller, 24 game streak came to a close. Over the span of Joe's 56 games, Travis hit a very respectable .356. Travis would lead Ted in the batting race up until the May, when the Splendid Splinter really ramped it up on the way to his most iconic season. 

And the Senators were still bad. Well, more like mediocre. The Yankees won the AL... Joe Cronin and Ted's Red Sox came in second, and the Senators went 70-84 as Travis hit like his life depended on it. Come the end of the season, Travis finished with .359 batting average- ahead of DiMaggio, but still dusted by Williams. His 218 hits though? That not only led the league but led the majors as a whole, the only player to have more than 200 hits that season. Travis set career highs in nigh every stat in this break-through season. Hits. Batting average. 101 RBI. 39 doubles. 19 triples. 7 homers. 150 OPS+. 6.8 WAR. He was especially excellent at night games- hitting .512 in 11 night games, leading the league in that particular stat. At the end of the year, Travis came in a career best 6th in MVP voting. First and second were DiMaggio and Williams. Third was some pitcher named Feller. Fourth was Thornton Lee, the same pitcher who previously beaned Travis in the head, and fifth was Charlie ""King Kong"" Keller. 

Through 1941, his aged 27 season, Travis' counting stats were strong. So far, 1,370 hits, notably more than legendary ""race for 3000 hits"" participant Starlin Castro had at that age. A .327 career batting average, primarily as a shortstop and third basemen (more settled into short). Sure, only 25 homers and 20 steals, but it was the average and hits that his legacy would rely on. In terms of advanced stats, his 31.6 WAR certainly wasn't bad for a pre prime. He was in a similar or better place to contemporary hall of famers at his age- Billy Herman, Luke Appling and even Charlie Gehringer. And if 1941 was a sign, then his career was JUST taking off. Sure, even if he didn't repeat it exactly, an extended prime in between his 1937/1938/1940 and '41 quality would give Cecil Travis as good a shot as any to reach three thousand hits. But he never had the chance. 

In December 1941, he lost his appeal and was drafted into the Army, entering WW2.

#The Aftermath

Things went okay for Cecil Travis at first. It wasn't an action packed start in the army. Sure, a celebrity could join, but he wasn't exactly sent to the front. From 1942 to 1944, he still traveled around the United States, playing on army baseball teams. But in late 1944, off he went to Europe. 

Travis won a bronze star and four battle stars during his service in World War II, but that's not all he carried. In service during the Battle of the Bulge, Travis would be hospitalized for frostbite. To save the rest of his feet, Travis had to get parts amputated- not an ideal situation if you're an MLB shortstop. With the end of the war in Europe, Travis would prepare to be re-deployed to the Pacific, but the war ended too quickly, and back to Washington he went. 

A three hit game in September would be the only highlight for Travis in his incredibly limited play. He said his timing was gone. And so was his defense- he moved from shortstop to third base. Only recently 32, he very well should have still been playing at a high level. 

1946 was Cecil Travis' last full year as a starter. Power wasn't there of course, but neither was the hit tool. Hitting .252, Travis also ended with more strike outs than walks for the first time since his rookie year. The Cecil Travis that left for war was no longer here. Not only was his hitting gone, but his fielding was beyond gone. No longer tolerable as a shortstop, the third base experiment did not go well either. He led the league in errors made at third base... while playing 56 total games at the position. Ouch. 

1947 saw the plug being pulled, and to the bench he went. His average continued to crater, fighting all season with the Mendoza Line, but he had one final highlight, even if it wasn't on the diamond. Late 1947, the Senators celebrated ""Cecil Travis Night,"" to give their old star his great send off. Manager Ossie Bluege (remember that name?) placed Travis back at third, and the miserable Senators showered their veteran with praise, gifts and celebration. 

It had a little bit of everything. Dwight D. Eisenhower in attendance and Mrs. Washington paraded about in a float. Over 150 local businesses coming together to raise money and provide gifts, from a new car, to a bull and hunting dogs, a dishwasher and a brand new trailer. An unsolicited gift from the.... umpires on a float. And marching pipe band. What's not to love? 

Travis retired at the end of the 1947 season, spending another decade as a scout before retiring to Georgia. His career stats stand as hardly improved over his from the end of 1941- 1,544 hits, 30.5 WAR, a .314 batting average and 108 OPS+. 

#Legacy

For a career that faced adversity and literal war, Travis was always a gentleman about it. Umpire Bill McGowan cited Travis as being the player that always gave him the least trouble and was most admirable in his conduct. Indeed, in the newspapers promoting Cecil Travis Day, they noted that he had never once embarrassed an umpire. Travis never blamed his frozen feet for his failure to pick his bat back up again after World War II- he just said he wasn't good enough, and lost his timing. Whether that's the man being humble or the absolute truth, we night never know. 

Cecil Travis was never seriously considered for the Hall of Fame. He never appeared on the BBWA ballot. In the mess of the 2007 Veteran's Committee ballot, Travis placed 22nd with about 15% of the vote- ahead of future hall members like Minnie Minoso, Dick Allen and Joe Gordon, but behind other names like Vada Pinson and Mickey Vernon. Statistically, he just wasn't up to snuff, no doubt about it. Sure, he had the third highest batting average for a shortstop ever... but his longevity was poor. He didn't have power. Speed. Defense was hit or miss. And he only had 1,500 hits. 

But beyond all of that, you'll still see me supporting Cecil Travis for the hall of fame. A clearer case of World War II costing someone a hall of fame career probably can't be seen- if Travis' level continued, 2000 hits was an absolute lock. Certainly, he'd give 3000 a strong run. His batting average probably won't dip for years, neither would his defense. Even his advanced stats would probably pull up to be more palatable. But whether it was the four year interruption in general or nearly losing his feet, Travis couldn't get there. There are a million players who saw injuries cost them their chance at the hall- but how many others saw that come from being drafted into military service? 

As they got older and were on the Veteran's Committee in the 90's, Ted Williams and Bob Feller would both become firm supporters of Travis' case. Ted Williams said he was one of the finest left handed hitters he ever saw. Feller said Travis was one of the toughest batters he ever had to face. If I have to be wrong, being wrong alongside Ted Williams and Bob Feller is more than acceptable.",10,1763271536.0,baseball,1,1.0,False

1oydl0b,https://www.reddit.com/r/paranoidschizophrenia/comments/1oydl0b/i_think_schizophrenia_made_me_do_this_but_im_not/,I think schizophrenia made me do this but im not that sure,"On my Facebook, when I had strong feelings about something or someone, I felt an urge to share a song that expressed my feelings, often accompanied by a video. As long as I managed to express what I had inside me, I felt satisfied and it allowed me to build a story.

One day, while visiting my hometown, I briefly met a girl whom I didn’t see again for years. Several years passed until one day I saw her on Facebook, and after exploring her personality a bit, I decided to try starting a conversation.

At first it went well, but later I realized she had gone through a heartbreak and was still dealing with those feelings. I kept trying to talk, we exchanged some songs, but at one impulsive and immature moment I tried too hard to push for an in-person coffee, and she didn’t like that, so she decided to cut off the conversation.

I really liked this girl, so my solution was to try building a musical story on my fb to see if I could recover the initial moment and try again. I kept searching until I found the song and video that I felt expressed things well. I did **not** have schizophrenia at that time.

After some time, when I felt the need to do it , sometimes I would hear my inner voice / my own thought telling me the name of a song or a band where I might find something. They weren’t subconscious memories, because most of the names that came weren’t from groups or songs I knew. Sometimes they were perfect hits, other times I had to search because, for example, only ‘Sebastian’ would come to mind and another word was missing. But the truth is that I always found a song that fit with the previous ones and with the symbols of the story I was trying to tell her.

After a while, I began to notice that the songs themselves seemed to be trying to explain the process to me in their music videos and even in some of the lyrics.

It was only about a year after this process started that I began to have symptoms of schizophrenia. In the first years I only heard the neighbors as if they were shouting things at me from their balconies, as if I were on a reality show.

After some years and other loves, the schizophrenia symptoms worsened and I started hearing 4 to 6 voices, always the same ones, 24/7, but internally in my mind, with the same attitude as the voices I had heard in the neighbors trying to make me believe I was in a reality show.

The voices stopped for three years, and it was during that time that something clicked: I realized I had gone through a years-long episode of schizophrenia.

I had other crushes and never stopped posting songs on Facebook, which sometimes also carried the meaning of that process I wanted everyone visiting my Facebook to understand. Meanwhile, the voices returned almost five years ago, the neighbors voices and half a dozen internal ones — and it has been more difficult.

They don’t like me calling the process ‘intuition.’

I leave you a summary in a playlist of 25 songs I put together so that people who didn’t see it live on Facebook can try to understand the process.

It has to be seen like a movie i promise that, among all my different thoughts, it will make sense and show something special, whether it’s my imagination or not.

1oydk9r,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1oydk9r/before_you_block_your_ex_please_consider/,Before you BLOCK your Ex. Please consider.,"With the exception of needing to block due to broken clearly identified boundaries or abuse and harassment, blocking someone without first creating boundaries or a no-contact plan is disrespectful to the relationship. And speaks to your character.
It is natural for someone to want to keep reaching out to someone that was a part of their life. That person is suddenly out of their life and takes with it companionship.  Be reasonable and give the relationship the respect it deserves. If you do not ask for what you want or need you will not get what you want or need. 

Here is the thing, my ex said they were stressed at work but never said it was due to continued contact. Nor did they say what they needed. If so, I would’ve asked how and encouraged clear boundaries. The average person thrives on boundaries, it gives them a sense of peace, it gives them an idea of where they can and can’t be, it helps them avoid overthinking things and the fear of over stepping. It’s one of the healthiest things someone can do. Unfortunately, creating those boundaries requires communication. 

Ask for what you want or what you need, or you’re never gonna get what you want or what you need. 

In my case, I would have said it would be best to block me for a certain amount of time because of my impulsive ADD. I knew this would be difficult from my point of view. I was in constant worry that I was overstepping, but there were confusing responses that maybe things were getting better. Sending me PICTs of projects he worked on. Etc. And then things would flip out of nowhere and no matter what I said it was turned against me. I finally commented that he’s overstressed and then he blocked me. Did not discuss with me, no boundaries discussed. In addition we were suppose to meet for coffee. But due to his stress, I thought I was taking the highroad and commented that we should probably reschedule due to that.

Now, WHAT DAMAGE HAVE YOU DONE or WILL DO?
Congratulations you made them hurt more. You dismantled their idea of the love you had for them. You made them question the character of the person that they thought they loved and shared their life with. I strongly urge you to consider reaching out and telling the other person that “given the situation of the relationship now and the emotional overload” that it would be better to reduce or stop contact for X amount of time. Go and heal, and if you each move on, great, at least you leave with dignity. And if you reconnect in the future you will be in a better place",3,1763271153.0,BreakUps,2,1.0,False
1oydjyu,https://i.redd.it/cz0qzuer1k1g1.jpeg,Fragrance World Qahwa & Fragrance World Double Espresso (Coffee Collection Series),"Continuing my trend of reviews of lesser heard perfumes, Qahwa and Double Espresso from Fragrance World is what I would like to talk about today. I am not familiar with the clones or inspirations from Fragrance World. However, as standalone perfumes, these are damn excellent offerings, especially for bitter black coffee lovers. With all the praises everywhere for Lataffa Khamrah and Khamrah Qahwa - which I found too sweet and headache inducing (also surprising, cos Khamrah Qahwa is nowhere near the profile of the actual qahwa) it lead me down the road to these two offerings after extensive research for something that helps with my caffeeine addiction without actually overdosing myself with black coffee.

You want the strong roasted coffee bitterness (with dash of cardamom) smell encapsulating you in its warmthness ? Double Espresso is what you are looking for.

You don't like the double strength americano smell at cafes and you want your coffee to be a little sweeter and cardamom spiciness ? Qahwa is the answer.

The only other coffee fragrance that has impressed me with closeness to an actual dark black Aeropress coffee or an esspresso machine coffee is Akro Awake (of course I am guilty of being on the second bottle of it in 2 years). Theodoros Kalotonis Coffee Addict (very synthetic and meh), Black Phantom, Amore Cafe etc.. never have satisfied the itch of my craving for the aroma of morning roasted ground black sugarless coffee.

As I live in the tropical climate dominant state of Kerala, all with its glory of humidity and hot rains, this is strictly for usage in your AC rooms/ halls or cooler climates (as should be any other 'coffee' perfumes).

1oyditw,https://www.reddit.com/r/stuffyouneeddaily/comments/1oyditw/which_carpet_cleaner_works_best_for_small_spaces/,Which carpet cleaner works best for small spaces?,"Hey everyone!

So I've been living in a pretty cramped apartment for the past two years, and honestly, keeping my carpets clean has been a nightmare. Between my dog tracking in mud and the occasional coffee spill, I needed something that actually works without taking up my entire closet.

I've tried those massive carpet cleaning machines before, and yeah, they work great, but storing them? Forget it. That's when I started looking into compact carpet cleaners that don't sacrifice cleaning power just because they're smaller.

**What Actually Matters in a Small Space Carpet Cleaner**

After testing a bunch of different models, here's what I learned. You want something lightweight that you can actually move around without throwing out your back. Storage is obviously huge when you're tight on space. And the water tank size matters more than you'd think – too small and you're refilling every five minutes, too big and the whole machine becomes bulky.

The suction power is probably the most important thing though. A small carpet cleaner that can't actually pull dirt and stains out of your carpet is basically useless, no matter how cute and compact it is.

**My Experience with Different Types**

I started with one of those handheld spot cleaners. They're great for quick spills and upholstery, but if you need to clean an entire room? You'll be there all day. Then I upgraded to a portable carpet cleaner machine, and that's where things got better.

The best carpet cleaners for small apartments are the upright models that are scaled down. They give you the deep cleaning power you need but don't require a storage unit to keep them. Most are around 10-15 pounds, which is way lighter than the professional-grade monsters.

**What Worked For Me**

I spent probably too much time researching this, but I found that checking out different options on Amazon helped a lot because you can compare sizes, read real reviews, and see actual measurements. If you're in the same boat as me, [check out these carpet cleaners](https://goodhomedeals.com/carpet-cleaner) to see what fits your space and budget.

The thing about carpet cleaning solutions is important too. Some machines need specific formulas, others work with whatever you want. I prefer the flexible ones because buying proprietary cleaning solution gets expensive fast.

**Real Talk About Performance**

The carpet shampooers I tested that worked best had heated cleaning. It sounds fancy, but it actually makes a huge difference in how well stains come out and how fast everything dries. Nobody wants wet carpet for two days in a tiny apartment.

Also, look for machines with attachments for stairs and furniture. Even in small spaces, you've got a couch or some chairs that need cleaning too.

**Bottom Line**

You don't need some giant industrial carpet steam cleaner to get your floors actually clean. The right compact model will handle pet stains, dirt, odors, and whatever else life throws at your carpet.

If you're ready to stop stressing about carpet stains and finally get something that fits in your apartment, [here's where I'd start looking](https://goodhomedeals.com/carpet-cleaner). Just pay attention to the dimensions and weight – your back and your closet will thank you.

Trust me, having clean carpets without sacrificing half your living space is totally possible. It just takes finding the right tool for the job.",1,1763271010.0,stuffyouneeddaily,0,1.0,False

I hang suspended in the Void. No light. No air. No body I can feel. Only a sound—distant and muffled—like a heartbeat echoing through someone else’s chest. 

*Thump…* 

A flash splits the darkness open: I’m in the campus cafeteria, laughing at the same dumb joke we’ve told a dozen times, trays shoved aside, my friends are halfway yelling and halfway dying from laughter. Then—nothing. 

*Thump…* 

Another flash: I vault a rooftop rail outside the dorms, shoes skidding across concrete as someone yells, **“Bro, you’re gonna eat it!”** Darkness swallows it whole.

*Thump…* 

My dog tackles me onto the couch. The sting of a tattoo needle burns color into my skin. A gym locker slams shut. Coffee explodes across my hoodie. Group chat spam. Midterm panic. Family dinner. Music loud enough to drown everything else. The beats speed up, ripping open more memories—too fast to hold onto, like someone flipping through my life just to blur the pages. 

*Thump-thump-thump-thump—*

 And then—

silence. 

A suffocating, absolute nothing.

Then a  woman’s voice—close enough that I feel the warmth of it against my ear—whispers into the void, **“Run.”** 

My eyes snap open. I lurch upright and choke on air I don’t remember needing. The room around me is wrong—wooden walls, uneven and splintering; lantern light flickering like it’s scared of the dark; dust drifting through the beams like lazy snowflakes. I’m in a bed. Not mine. Too narrow. Too scratchy.

My pulse hammers as the door shudders. **THUD. THUD. THUD.** A man shouts from the other side, voice sharp and authoritative, **“He’s in here! Don’t let him escape!”**

“What—” I manage, before the door explodes inward. Men in dark coats flood the room, cloth masks hiding their faces. Their gloves gleam with metal plates that catch the lantern light like teeth. One of them points at me. **“Don’t let him use the ink!”** I have no idea what the hell that means. I don’t feel the need to ask either because, that disembodied voice rung true in my head. **“Run.”**

The window is ancient—thin wood, weak glass. Probably a terrible idea. I dive through it anyway. Glass shatters around me like frozen rain as I tumble into a narrow stone alley and land hard on my shoulder. Pain spikes up my arm, but the adrenaline is louder. Above me, one of the men shouts, **“HE’S OUTSIDE—MOVE!”** I scramble up so fast I slip. I don’t know where I am, who these people are, or how any of this is happening.

Boots thunder behind me as I tear down the alley. The path splits; I choose the skinnier one—less room for them to grab me—dodging crates, hanging laundry, and… chickens. Sure. Why not. Chickens. Add that to the list of confusion. A shadow drops from above as one of the masked men slams into the ground in front of me, blocking the path. He swings. I duck on instinct, heart in my throat, and sprint past him.

Another man rounds the corner and grabs my arm. His grip is iron. Panic spikes hard enough to blur my vision. I frantically flail my arm, ripping my sleeve in the process. The fabric tears clean off, but he latches onto my bare arm with his other hand. Then he jerks back like my skin burns him. **“Don’t grab his bare arm—are you insane?!”** I don’t stay long enough to care what that means.

I burst out of the alley and stumble into a street so crowded and unreal I almost forget to keep running. People in long black trench coats. Rail cars rumbling down metal tracks. Storefronts with wooden signs. Blimps—actual blimps—floating overhead like brass whales. Castle-like buildings in the distance cough dark smog into the sky. “What the hell…” I whisper—or think—or dream—before the shouts behind me snap me back to reality.

“Shit.” I duck my head and push into the crowd, trying to blend in, but everyone stops. Every single person steps back from me until I’m alone in a widening ring of strangers. Their eyes fill with fear. Children cry. Someone hurls a bottle. It explodes near my feet. **“Get out of here, you filthy Stain!”** I stagger backward as more masked men—new ones—force their way through the crowd. I turn the other way—more men, same uniforms, closing in.

No exit.

Until I look up and see a sagging wooden sign and a slanted roof above it. “…Screw it.” I sprint toward the wall, jump, catch the sign, and use its wild swing to throw myself onto the roof. The tiles crack under me as I scramble up. 

Shouts echo behind me. **“He’s heading for the Canal! Cut him off!”** I run across the rooftops, leaping gaps, trying not to die, while below, the men match my pace like hunting dogs.

A blinding light explodes over me. I reel mid-jump. “What the—? What now, man!” A blimp rises into view, a massive spotlight spearing through the fog straight onto me like a damn stage cue. To the Right: a crowded street I can’t clear. Behind: masked men gaining fast. Left: a massive stone canal cutting through the city like a scar—a drop brutal enough to break everything that matters to me.

My breath steams in the cold air. My arm throbs where the man nearly snapped it. My heart feels like it’s trying to punch its way out of my ribs. “What do I do…?” I can’t think. I can barely breathe. There’s no way out. “One… two… three…” I exhale, plant my foot, and launch myself toward the canal.

The men shout, **“Don’t let him jump—he’s a Stain, he can—!”** But the rest is torn away by the wind as I hurl myself over the edge.

“Please don’t hurt, please don’t hurt, please don’t—”

There is no light. No air. No body to call my own.

A 9'x12' rug would practically be wall to wall carpeting and show very little floor around the edges, so I've been looking at options for slightly smaller. 

The room will have a very large sofa (110"" wide) taking up one entire wall, so there aren't a lot of options that have the full sofa on the rug. 

Options I'm considering are 8'x10' horizontal, 8'x10' vertical, 8' square, or 9' square. The attached diagram shows the relative proportions for each option in the room (the wall at the bottom of the floor plan is open to the kitchen).

**PASSIVE —** ***Sugar Addiction***

When Sukari lands her M1 **Frosting Injector Jab**, survivors gain **Addiction Stacks**.

# ✔ What Addiction Does

* Each stack slightly **slows the survivor** (small, fair amount).
* At 3 stacks, the survivor becomes **“Overdosed”**, giving them:
   * A brief **screen distortion** (like sugar rush crash)
   * A **stumble animation**
   * Reduced vault/climb speed for a few seconds

Stacks decay slowly only when Sukari is far away. 🍮 **ABILITY 1 —** ***Caramel Monster***

Sukari opens a small pastel candy bag.  
A **gooey caramel creature**—like a wobbling caramel slime—plops out and begins to **wander around on its own**.

# ✔ Behavior

* It roams randomly within a radius around where it spawned.
* It moves slowly but steadily, like a curious little blob.
* It makes cute bubbly noises so survivors can hear it coming.

# ✔ When it touches a survivor

The caramel monster **jumps onto them** and becomes a sticky mass that:

* **Holds them in place**
* Forces them to **mash A + D (or directional keys)** to break free
* Applies **1 Addiction stack**
* Leaves caramel residue on them (small slowdown for 1–2 sec after escape)

# ✔ Duration

* The monster lasts **10–14 seconds**, or until it successfully grabs someone.

# ✔ Limit

* Sukari can only have **1 caramel monster active at a time**.

# ✔ Cooldown

* 15–18 seconds **Caramel Monster — Dual Appearance Mechanic**

# ✔ Sukari’s Perspective

When Sukari summons the caramel monster:

* It looks like an **adorable caramel blob**
   * Round
   * Glossy
   * Little cherry or swirl on top
   * Cute blinking expression
   * Soft wobble animation

This reinforces her delusional view of her creations as “perfect pastries.”

# ✔ Survivor Perspective

Survivors see the **truth**:

A **horrifying melted caramel amalgamation**:

* Limbs fused into dripping caramel
* Half-formed faces or mouths emerging and sinking back
* Caramel strings stretching and snapping as it moves
* Sticky bubbling noises
* A faint distorted moan layered with the cutesy sound Sukari hears

**Caramel Monster — Counterplay Mechanic**

# ✔ Survivors can destroy the caramel monster using:

* **Flashbang**
* **Doom Gauntlet**
* (Optional: any light-based stun item you might add later)

# ✔ When destroyed:

The caramel monster **splats violently**, sending caramel chunks flying everywhere.

Survivor POV:

* Horrifying shriek + messy explosion

Sukari POV:

* It looks like a cute balloon popping
* But her eyes widen in fury as the “cuteness” dies **DESTROYING THE MONSTER INCREASES SUKARI’S RAGE**

# ✔ Rage meter increases by:

* **10–15% per destroyed monster** 🍰 **ABILITY 2 —** ***Freshly Baked***

Sukari proudly pulls out a plate holding **one random dessert** from her bakery.  
She holds it with both hands and can **offer it to a nearby survivor.**

# ✔ How It Works

* She can **“offer”** the dessert when within a short distance (like a charm mechanic).
* A prompt appears for the survivor: **“Eat Dessert?”**
* Survivors must decide quickly:
   * **Eat it** and gamble
   * **Decline** and keep running
   * **Flashbang / Doom Gauntlet her** to ruin the dessert

**There are 4 possible desserts** she can pull out:

# ① Cupcake (Buff or Debuff)

* **Good Cupcake:**
   * Small speed boost for 3 seconds
   * Slight health regen (grey health)
* **Bad Cupcake:**
   * Slowdown effect
   * \+1 Addiction stack

# ② Macaron

* **Good Macaron:**
   * Quiet footsteps for 5 seconds
* **Bad Macaron:**
   * Loud “sugar crunch” footsteps survivors cannot hide
   * \+1 Addiction

# ③ Slice of Pie

* **Good Pie:**
   * Removes 1 Addiction stack
* **Bad Pie:**
   * Immediately gives 2 Addiction stacks
   * Mild screen wobble (sugar rush crash)

# ④ Pudding Cup

* **Good Pudding:**
   * Temporary shield against the next hit (removes damage once)
* **Bad Pudding:**
   * Mild damage-over-time “sugar burn”
   * \+1 Addiction

# ✔ All Desserts Have a “Cute Version” and a “Horror Version”

Just like the caramel monster:

* **Sukari sees delicious, adorable pastries**
* **Survivors see mutated, rotten, chemical nightmares**
   * Cupcake with teeth
   * Macaron pulsating
   * Pie oozing pink sludge
   * Pudding filled with writhing shapes
* **If the dessert is GOOD (buff):**

Sukari gets **visually confused and frustrated**:

* “Huh? That… wasn’t supposed to happen…”
* She stomps one foot like a bratty magical girl losing control
* Rage meter increases **slightly (+3–5%)**
* **If the survivor FLASHBANGS or DOOM GAUNTLETS her during the offer:**

The dessert plate **flies out of her hands**, smashing to the ground.

# Sukari reaction:

* First: shocked gasp
* Then: her smile twitches
* Rage meter increases **a LOT (+15–20%)**
* **ABILITY 3 — Boba Maker**

# Setup

* Sukari places a **small table with a blender** anywhere in the map (line-of-sight placement).
* She can move freely while it’s blending — doesn’t have to babysit it.
* After a set **blend time** (\~8–12 seconds), the smoothie is ready.
* Only **Sukari can see its location** while it’s blending.

# Survivor Interaction

* Survivors can see the blender **once it’s done blending** (they can’t see it before).
* Options for survivors:
   1. **Drink the Boba**
      * Gain a **buff** (speed, stamina regen, vision clarity, etc.)
      * Gain **1 Addiction stack** (risk/reward mechanic)
   2. **Pour out the smoothie**
      * Prevents Sukari from buffing herself
      * Increases her **Rage meter significantly** (+10–15%)

# Sukari Buffs

Once the Boba is done, if she drinks it, she gains a **random buff**, depending on the smoothie type:

1. **Berry Blitz** → movement speed +15% for 6 seconds
2. **Vanilla Vigor** → stamina regen increased +15% for 6 seconds
3. **Chocolate Charge** → M1 cooldown slightly reduced for 6 seconds
4. **Mystery Mash** → next ability casts 1 second faster, minor M1 damage boost

* Boba visuals: cute pastel-colored drinks with Boba and sparkles from her perspective
* Survivors see a **mutated, bubbling horror version** with writhing shapes inside

# Rage Interaction

* If survivors **pour out or destroy** the smoothie:
   * Sukari is visibly angry: eyes widen, frosting drips, laugh cracks
   * Rage meter fills more than normal
* **RAGE MODE —** ***Sugar Overload***

# Trigger Conditions

Sukari’s Rage meter fills from the following events:

1. **Caramel Monster destroyed** (flashbang, doom gauntlet) → +15%
2. **Dessert wasted or eaten correctly** → +3–5% per event
3. **Smoothie poured out** → +10–15%
4. Optional: small passive gain over time if survivors avoid her too long (\~1–2%/10 sec)

**Max Rage:** 100% → automatically triggers **Rage Mode**

**Rage Meter Stages & Animations**

# 1. Low Rage (0–33%) — Calm

* **Voice:** Cheerful, sweet, playful.
* **Animation:** Normal pastel-girl bakery movements. Walk/run are bouncy and light.
* **Visual:** Everything looks cute and pristine.
* **Trigger feedback:** Slight tilt of her head or small hand gesture when a rage-increasing event occurs.
* **Voiceline example:**
   * “Oh dear… that’s interesting!”
   * “Hmm? That didn’t go as planned…”

# 2. Medium Rage (34–66%) — Cracking

* **Voice:** Slightly higher-pitched, giggle starts to crack, undertone of frustration.
* **Animation:**
   * Grips frosting injector tighter
   * Walk/run slightly stiffer, less playful
   * Small twitch in eye or shoulder
* **Visual:** Frosting on apron looks slightly drippy, colors subtly darker.
* **Trigger feedback:** Each event adds small visual/auditory cues (minor sound of icing “squishing” or hand tremble).
* **Voiceline example:**
   * “Oh… I didn’t like that at all!”
   * “Really now? Hmph!”

# 3. High / Almost Full Rage (67–99%) — Struggling to Stay Calm

* **Voice:** She’s clearly trying to maintain composure; voice strained, cracking, whispery giggles turning sharp.
* **Animation:**
   * Shaky breath, chest rising and falling faster
   * Eye twitches or subtle widen/shift
   * Hand gripping icing weapon tightly, knuckles whitening
   * Walk/run stiff, almost tense
* **Visual:** Frosting drips faster, apron fraying slightly, colors desaturated slightly
* **Trigger feedback:** Every rage-increasing event visibly adds to the tension
* **Voiceline example:**
   * “Stop… behaving like this…”
   * “I… I can’t… just… behave!”

# 4. Full Rage (100%) — Sugar Overload Mode

**Visual Transformation**

* **Pastel aesthetic gone**: Frosting, sprinkles, and pastel apron drip **blood-red** instead of pink.
* **Hair & clothing**: Slightly frayed, darker shading, subtle chemical/steam effects around her head.
* **Eyes**: Glow unnaturally, pupils dilate, twitch, or flicker.
* **Hands/weapon**: Frosting injector or icing tool now coated in blood-like substance, small twitch animations.
* **Aura**: Chemical fumes/sparkles glow darker, more ominous.

# Voice Changes

* **Voice fully unhinged**: Mad scientist tone, layered laughs, shrill giggles, strained exclamations.
* **Speaking style**: Shifts from “cute” to “maniacal genius” — high-pitched obsession mixed with low growls.
* **Dynamic VO based on events**:
   * Caramel monster destroyed → maniacal shriek
   * Dessert poured out → sharp, angry laugh
   * Smoothie poured out → furious cackling + ranting

**Example VO lines in Full Rage:**

* “You *dare* ruin my creations?!”
* “Foolish little ingredients… I’ll **bake you myself**!”
* “Perfection… will be mine… ALL OF IT!”
* **Animation Changes**
* Walk/run: aggressive, deliberate, almost predatory
* Idle: breathing visibly shaky, hands twitching
* M1: grips icing injector tighter, slams or jabs more violently
* Ability casts: exaggerated, manic hand movements, leaning forward
* **Core Change:** Delusion Wears Off
* **During Rage Mode**, Sukari no longer sees her world as cute.
* She now **perceives everything like survivors do**:
   * Caramel Monster appears as a twisted, melting amalgamation
   * Desserts look horrific and toxic
   * Smoothie is murky, swirling, and monstrous
* **Updated Dessert Effects**
* In Rage Mode, **Freshly Baked desserts no longer give small buffs or debuffs normally**.
* Instead, survivors who eat them have a **chance to be poisoned**:
   * **Damage over time (DoT)** for 3–5 seconds
   * **Adds Addiction stacks** as usual
* This turns the dessert into a **high-risk trap** instead of a minor gamble.
* Sukari’s reaction:
   * She notices “toxicity” in her creations and laughs manically:“Oh… the *flavors*… they’re… perfect!”
* **Other Rage Mode Mechanics (unchanged but reinforced)**
* Movement speed +25–30%
* M1 faster, applies 2–3 Addiction stacks per hit
* Ability cooldowns \~20% faster
* Caramel Monster more aggressive
* Boba buffs stronger
* **Ending Rage Mode — Interactive Calming**

Instead of automatically ending:

* Survivors must **perform a specific action or use an item** to calm her down. Examples:
   * Giving her a “special dessert” (neutralizing item)
   * Activating a device or environment object in the map
* Once the action is performed:
   * Sukari’s cute personality **returns**
   * Frosting and pastel visuals restore
   * Eyes return to normal
   * VO: apologetic, embarrassed, sweet“I… I’m sorry… I just… got a little carried away.”
* 🍰 **1. Offer a Neutral Dessert**
* Survivors can craft or find a **“neutral pastry”** in the map (like a simple cookie or plain cupcake).
* Giving it to her restores her calm, removes Rage Mode.
* Risk: survivors must get close to her while she’s enraged.
* VO cue: “Oh… you… brought me something… thank you…”

# 🍬 2. Clean Up / Destroy Environmental Mess

* Example: broken smoothies, spilled caramel, or failed dessert traps.
* Survivors interact with these objects to **restore order**, symbolically calming her OCD/bakery obsession.
* Risk: time-consuming; she may attack while they try.
* VO cue: “Ah… everything’s… back to normal, thank you…”

# 🧁 3. Activate a Map Device

* A laboratory/oven/gadget that emits a **soothing aroma, chemical mist, or musical chime**.
* Survivor must reach and activate it, calming her chemically-induced rage.
* Can be tied to lore: she loves the smell of her bakery, or the right chemical composition soothes her.
* VO cue: “Yes… that’s… perfect… I feel better…”

# 🍭 4. Use a Special Item

* Survivors carry an **item dropped randomly** on the map (e.g., “Sugar Charm” or “Soothing Milkshake”).
* Throwing it at her or interacting with her calms her.
* Encourages planning and resource management.
* VO cue: “Oh… I didn’t mean to… thank you…”

# 🍫 5. Teamwork Interaction

* Two survivors must **cooperate**, e.g., one distracts while the other offers the item.
* Adds **coordinated gameplay**, risk/reward.
* VO cue: “You… worked together? That’s… very kind…”

# 🍮 6. Environmental Sweet Spot

* Certain areas in the map (like her bakery, lab, or a sugar-scented zone) automatically **gradually reduce rage** if she enters it.
* Creates strategic positioning opportunities for survivors.
* VO cue: “Ah… back in my kitchen… I can… breathe…”

🍰 **IDLE / PASSIVE / SURVIVOR NEARBY**

* “Ooh… someone smells sweet!”
* “Would you like a treat? Or maybe… something stronger?”
* “I just baked something special… for you!”
* “My sweets… always make people happy… don’t they?”
* *Small giggle* “Hehe… hehe…”

# 🧁 M1 ATTACK (Frosting Injector Jab)

* “Say ahhh!”
* “This’ll taste… delightful!”
* “A little frosting… for you!”
* “Don’t move… it’s for your own good!”
* Rage version: “You… I’ll make you *perfect*! Ahahaha!”

# 🍮 ABILITY 1 — Caramel Monster

* Summon:
   * “Come out, my little friend!”
   * “Time to play… a game!”
* Attack / grab:
   * “Sticky… hehe!”
   * “Can’t run from sweetness!”
* Destroyed by flashbang/doom gauntlet:
   * Low rage: “Oh… that’s… unfortunate.”
   * Medium: “My… my little friend!” *voice cracks*
   * High: “NO! You… you will regret this!!”

# 🍬 ABILITY 2 — Freshly Baked (Desserts)

* Offer dessert:
   * “A special treat… just for you!”
   * “Taste… and see how sweet life is.”
* Survivor eats good dessert (unexpected):
   * “Huh…? That… wasn’t supposed to happen…”
   * “Oh… oh no… why?!?”
* Survivor eats bad dessert:
   * “Mmm… yes, perfect flavor!”
* Dessert wasted (pour out):
   * “W-What? NO! How dare you?!”
* Rage version:
   * “Taste… my creations… fully!”
   * “Poison… perfection… hehehehehe!”

# 🍹 ABILITY 3 — Smoothie Maker

* Place blender:
   * “A little mix… for maximum flavor!”
   * “Soon… it’ll be *perfect!*”
* Drink smoothie:
   * “Ahh… yes… invigorating!”
   * Rage: “Power… flowing through me!”
* Survivor drinks:
   * “Oh… you dare?! Hahaha… interesting…”
* Survivor destroys/pours:
   * Low rage: “Oh… how rude…”
   * Medium: “This… this is unacceptable!”
   * High: “FOOLISH! You’ll pay for this!!!”

# 🧬 PASSIVE — ADDICTION TRIGGER

* “Mmm… don’t you want more?”
* “Sweetness… always calls back…”
* Rage medium/high:
   * “I… I can’t control it anymore!”
   * “Must… perfect… flavor…”

# 🔥 RAGE MODE (Full Sugar Overload)

* Activation:
   * “I’ve had enough! TIME TO PERFECT EVERYTHING!!”
   * “You… you ruined it all… but I’ll fix it… MY WAY!”
* Attack lines:
   * “FEEL MY WRATH… AND SWEETNESS!”
   * “Addiction… perfection… YOUR END!”
* Dessert / Smoothie interactions:
   * “Taste it… suffer… delight… hehe!”
* Ended by survivors’ calming action:
   * “I… I’m… sorry… I just… got a little carried away.”
   * “Phew… thank you… I feel… much better.”

Everything sounds clean, sparkly, warm, and energetic.

# Key Motifs:

* **Sparkle Arps:** Little twinkling runs that mimic “sugar sprinkles”

1oydgqo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychosis/comments/1oydgqo/i_think_psychosis_made_me_do_this/,I think psychosis made me do this,"On my Facebook, when I had strong feelings about something or someone, I felt an urge to share a song that expressed my feelings, often accompanied by a video. As long as I managed to express what I had inside me, I felt satisfied and it allowed me to build a story.

One day, while visiting my hometown, I briefly met a girl whom I didn’t see again for years. Several years passed until one day I saw her on Facebook, and after exploring her personality a bit, I decided to try starting a conversation.

At first it went well, but later I realized she had gone through a heartbreak and was still dealing with those feelings. I kept trying to talk, we exchanged some songs, but at one impulsive and immature moment I tried too hard to push for an in-person coffee, and she didn’t like that, so she decided to cut off the conversation.

I really liked this girl, so my solution was to try building a musical story on my fb to see if I could recover the initial moment and try again. I kept searching until I found the song and video that I felt expressed things well. I did **not** have schizophrenia at that time.

After some time, when I felt the need to do it , sometimes I would hear my inner voice / my own thought telling me the name of a song or a band where I might find something. They weren’t subconscious memories, because most of the names that came weren’t from groups or songs I knew. Sometimes they were perfect hits, other times I had to search because, for example, only ‘Sebastian’ would come to mind and another word was missing. But the truth is that I always found a song that fit with the previous ones and with the symbols of the story I was trying to tell her.

After a while, I began to notice that the songs themselves seemed to be trying to explain the process to me in their music videos and even in some of the lyrics.

It was only about a year after this process started that I began to have symptoms of schizophrenia. In the first years I only heard the neighbors as if they were shouting things at me from their balconies, as if I were on a reality show.

After some years and other loves, the schizophrenia symptoms worsened and I started hearing 4 to 6 voices, always the same ones, 24/7, but internally in my mind, with the same attitude as the voices I had heard in the neighbors trying to make me believe I was in a reality show.

The voices stopped for three years, and it was during that time that something clicked: I realized I had gone through a years-long episode of schizophrenia.

I had other crushes and never stopped posting songs on Facebook, which sometimes also carried the meaning of that process I wanted everyone visiting my Facebook to understand. Meanwhile, the voices returned almost five years ago, the neighbors voices and half a dozen internal ones — and it has been more difficult.

They don’t like me calling the process ‘intuition.’

I leave you a summary in a playlist of 25 songs I put together so that people who didn’t see it live on Facebook can try to understand the process.

It has to be seen like a movie i promise that, among all my different thoughts, it will make sense and show something special, whether it’s my imagination or not.

And leave me sweeping up your ashes

Hoping I can scrub you from my floor

One that I paint over through tears

And am I just me?

Walking the dog

Soft kisses goodnight

TL;DR: 26yo roasting my growth lags, dumb loops, off-beat vibes, and one regret fork. Funny but real—what's yours?

I'm 26, and it's like I've lapped my own damn life twice already. Mind's finally sharp—ripped through Kiyosaki's money mindfucks and Adair's rants on why your brain's basically a slot machine you keep feeding quarters. Heart? Forged in the fire of ghosted texts that hit like a gut punch from an ex you didn't even like that much. And that deeper vibe? It sneaks up on runs, when the world's just pounding feet and heavy breaths, reminding you there's more to this shit than paying for Wi-Fi.

But the everyday crap? It's stuck in neutral, brother. Fridge looks like a serial killer's evidence locker—empty cans and pizza boxes from the Carter administration. Closet's a shrine to broke-ass 20-year-old me, hoarding tees that smell like regret and cheap beer. Meanwhile, every other dude my age is out here with meal-prep spreadsheets and apartments that scream ""I adult now."" Me? Still wrestling yesterday's socks like they're trying to escape. Cleared the decks last week, though—hauled the junk to the curb, loaded up on steak and greens like I suddenly give a damn. Felt... lighter. Not some Hallmark breakthrough, just less like I'm fighting a war with my own kitchen. That lag? It's yelling ""wake up,"" not ""give up.""

### My Loop

Life's got this scripted drag to it, like I accidentally wrote a bad Netflix series and forgot to cast anyone interesting. Not some Illuminati bullshit—just the dumb loops I programmed at 22, when rent was the real boss and ""adulting"" meant not bouncing checks. Same coffee run every morning (overpriced swill from that hipster spot where the barista judges your order), emails bleeding into the abyss till your eyes cross, and a hard ""no"" to any risk that smelled like ""what if I end up under a bridge?""

Now it's all on repeat: same tired stories at poker night, weekends dissolving into a numb scroll-fest that leaves you wondering if you even blinked. Hit the ceiling-stare epiphany the other night—*Holy shit, I built this cage.* One tweak, though: ditched the usual route for a backroad shuffle, texted that contact I'd been ghosting harder than my exes—boom, gig lands like it was waiting for me to grow a pair. Swapped endless scrolling for jotting actual ideas, and suddenly days feel less like a treadmill, more like a choose-your-own-adventure where you don't hate the plot. Own the code, man, or it'll code your ass right into oblivion.

### Off-Beat

Nothing exposes the mismatch like a barbecue—whole group's locked in like they're auditioning for a Bud Light commercial: trash-talking fantasy leagues, homes staged like HGTV rejects, everything flowing smoother than a trust-fund kid's hair product. Me? Rocking a frayed flannel that saw better days on a muddy hike, walls at home plastered with half-assed sketches that look like a toddler's fever dream, pulse thumping to some internal drum no one else hears. *Why can't I just... vibe with the program?*

Turns out, it's not a glitch—it's my secret sauce, the weirdo frequency that weeds out the phonies. Last fire-pit hang, this girl on the fringe nailed it: ""Dude, you're hearing the remix while everyone's stuck on the radio edit."" We spilled the beans—no bullshit—her bailing on a soul-sucking desk gig for something real, me venting the constant itch for less scripted chaos. A couple others wandered over, and boom: no awkward small talk, just that rare click where it feels like you all showed up to the same uninvited party. The off-beat? It doesn't isolate you; it filters for the keepers. Who needs the herd when you've got the pack?

### The Fork

Three a.m. hits like a bad burrito—regret cold and churning: that fork at 23, snagging the ""safe"" job over jetting abroad for the wild-card hustle. Dad's gravelly wisdom: ""Bills don't give a fuck about your dreams, kid."" Cue the chain gang: endless desk marathons, the spark of a connection who peaced out for greener pastures, ideas gathering dust like forgotten gym memberships. *Man, one mulligan on that call... whole life's a different channel.*

Can't hit undo, though—life ain't a video game with infinite lives. But flip the script: that gig? It handed me the toolbox I'm wielding now for side hustles that actually light a fire under my ass. Shot a text to an old mentor yesterday—dropped some sketches, and next thing, collab's bubbling like cheap champagne. Woke up to dawn feeling less like a victim, more like the guy with the scars and the map. What's next, not ""what if""—that's the real hack. Regret's just the universe's way of saying, ""Hey, dumbass, turn left next time.""

This dump's the kind of late-night brain vomit I'd actually revisit on a Tuesday slump. Spot your lag, tweak a loop, lean into the off-beat, reroute the fork. What's one you're messing with this week? Spill—we're looping this shit together.",0,1763269770.0,getdisciplined,10,0.5,False

all i can say is the coffee was excellent and both to me and my partner’s taste but we were really uncomfortable the whole time we were staying sa restaurant na yon kasi upon going there after nilang malaman na we were there just for the coffee the servers seemed to be put off to the point na parang padabog nung isang server nilapag yung complimentary water which we did not drink na lang due to the fact na padabog niya nilapag at nafefeel namin na medyo tense yung atmosphere. The servers behind the counter idk if imagination q lang to pero mararamdaman mo naman if masama ang titig sayo ng isang tao lalo na nasa harapan lang namin halos counter nila. 

So after some uncomfortable minutes of waiting for our coffee to arrive much to the dismay rin ng servers saying na “follow up niyo nga yung order nila ang tagal na nitong dalawang to” or something along those lines we decided to dip out not after being told twice ""thank u boss ha"" in a somewhat sarcastic tone by a different server.

+I get naman na siguro it was a fusion/collaborating restaurant that requires u to buy something from them in order to order coffee from the cafe, pero since we were just there to get coffee for both me and my partner’s sleep deprived selves, nakakadissapoint lang na they chose to be blatantly rude na wala kaming bibilhin sa kanila mismo. They knew rin na nililinis yung cafe so customers just wanting to buy coffee from that cafe would probably head over to them just to buy coffee because again the place is being cleaned.

1oycw4s,https://i.redd.it/4esklqfovj1g1.jpeg,Simple fire safety blunder or candle spell gone wrong?,"I did a spell candle to invite self love and romantic/platonic fulfillment into my life, because since ending my 6 year long toxic relationship, I’ve been having a hard time seeing myself as attractive and not being insecure about how dating and making new friends has not been as fun and simple as I’d expected. 

I took a red taper candle, oiled it, rolled it in a mix of cinnamon, salt, honey, coffee, rose and lavender petals, and rosemary. I melted the bottom into a small, aluminum, heart shaped tin and filled the bottom with the leftover herbs, a honey candy (because I keep them in my purse and offer them to people I go on dates with lol), a teeeeny tiny bit of my hair, two rose quartz pieces, vanilla, a drop of the honey and rose perfume I wear every day, and the ashes of a piece of paper with my name, DOB, and intentions wrapped in red string. 

In front of a photo of myself as a little kid and one of me now, I let it burn all day (big ass candle) and nothing was wrong. it was in my sight as I worked on college course work all afternoon in the same room. Toward the middle of the burn, the wax melting down the side had formed a shape that looked to me like two people kissing/embracing. Toward the end, there was a very large flame on the side facing the picture of me now, and a smaller one directly next to it on the side facing the picture of little me. All around were smaller flames that flickered in and out that my first thought was that they represented other people coming and going, while the other two flames represented my relationship between myself and my inner child staying strong no matter who/what came into my life or whether they stayed or went. Occasionally all or some of the many flame points would merge into one big one. 

I talked to it every time I passed by, prayed, thanked it for its service to me, etc. 

once it had burned to the point where the tin had totally filled with wax and it was barely burning anymore, instead of putting it out as I left to run some errands, I just figured it was going to burn out any minute now and I could let it be. When I got home two hours later, it smelled very smoky as soon as I opened the front door (no smoke lingering in the house though). 

Upon examination, the rose quartz had exploded across the counter into several small chips and burnt little pieces of herbs were all scattered around it. Everything in the tin turned to black ash, and underneath the tin on the counter is a burn mark. Nothing surrounding the tin is damaged though. 

Was this all just because I didn’t monitor it and it was a fire safety issue, or did I severely fuck up the spell somehow? Everything including myself was cleansed with holy water, incense, and a lucky bell both before and during the burn, and I very recently did an egg cleanse that was all clear.

Winter’s here—with its chill, its chaos, and its quiet revelations.

End-sem exams are near. First semester wrapping up. Time flies, and so does the year. But this season taught me something: patience. Sometimes what we seek is right beside us—we just need to breathe and look.

Sipping coffee, croissant in hand, I’m writing this. Never thought I’d be here—studying what I study, living what I live. Lesson two: expect the unexpected.

This year? Wild. First article published. First gold in writing. Essay wins. Coding. Art. Studies. All of it. Because I believe in trying everything. Multitasking isn’t chaos—it’s curiosity. And I’m proudly rebellious about that.

Life’s unpredictable. But you are the constant. So explore, learn, balance, and chase what sets your soul on fire.

Exams are coming. Panic is real. But I trust it’ll work out. My mantra:

“Feel blessed for what you have. Keep working for what you want.”

Share how your year was. What you experienced and learnt in 2025?

His Cure Was Never Me
Chapter 1
""I'm Zachary Petersen, and I want to say something special to the person I love.""
Unable to sleep, Rebecca Zamora turned on the late-night radio—only to hear Zachary's deep, magnetic voice.
They had been married for three years. In the beginning, Zachary could still manage a few short sentences despite his selective mutism.
But in the last three months, even when they sat face-to-face, he hadn't spoken a single word.
""We haven't seen each other in three years. I can't wait to meet you tomorrow.""
The words on the broadcast clearly weren't meant for her.
""I love you, Gina.""
His voice had never sounded so alive, so full of emotion.
The host followed up with admiration and excitement, but Rebecca just sat frozen on the bed, her mind blank.
She had married him through a family arrangement. It was love at first sight for her, but Zachary had always been distant and cold.
When they first met, his mother had tried to explain, ""Bekah, please understand... Zach suffers from selective mutism.""
After a while, Rebecca called Zachary's mother, Sarah Petersen.
""Bekah, you alright? Why did you call me this late?""
Rebecca's voice trembled, thick with tears, and Sarah immediately panicked.
""What's wrong? Did Zach upset you?
""Did you know Gina was back?""
There was a long pause. Then Rebecca realized that she was the only one left in the dark.
""I'm sorry, Bekah... Three years ago, I didn't tell you the truth. Zach's selective mutism started after his ex-girlfriend, Georgina Schwartz, left him.
""I didn't know what else to do, so I pushed him into that blind date...
""How ridiculous, isn't it? The heir to the Petersen family in New York, and he can't even speak. But don't worry. I'll make sure he behaves himself.""
Rebecca couldn't even remember how she hung up the phone, nor how she made it through that long, lonely night.
She had once researched every possible treatment. One of the causes listed was ""severe emotional trauma.""
Rebecca had asked around, but no one in the Petersen family could give her a clear answer.
She tried everything—therapy, electro-stimulation, cooking his favorite foods, even meditation sessions. She once dragged him to a stand-up show, laughing until she cried while he sat there, stiff and silent.
When he finally proposed, it was only after an agonizing hesitation that he managed two words—""Marry me.""
She had never been so happy.
Now, that joy only made the pain sharper.
Of course, she could never cure his silence because she was not the one who could heal him inside.
A bitter ache rose in her chest, and fear crept in with it.
His cure was back. So what did that make her?
Her limp hands clenched into fists. A surge of stubborn resolve filled her heart.
If Zachary didn't love her, there was no point staying trapped in this marriage. He would never ask for a divorce, but Rebecca could.
She would give him back to his cure, once and for all.
With that decision made, Rebecca took a deep breath and began to pack.
Three years ago, she had given up her chance to study medicine overseas for Zachary.
Maybe it wasn't too late to start again.
Chapter 2
The next morning, Rebecca left the house early, planning to stop by the nearby mall and pick up some new clothes for herself.
""Miss, that's the last outfit we have in stock. Would you like to take it?"" the salesgirl asked.
Rebecca nodded and handed over her card.
""I'm so sorry, but another customer offered to pay extra for it. Would you mind letting it go?""
Following the salesgirl's gaze, Rebecca saw a striking woman in heels chatting animatedly with a man.
She took a few steps forward, then froze when their eyes met.
It was Zachary.
And the woman beside him... had to be Georgina.
His expression tightened immediately.
He opened his mouth, but no sound came out. Then, with his usual calm detachment, he tapped his phone screen with his index finger.
It was a gesture she knew all too well. It meant he wanted to communicate through his phone.
""What are you doing here?""
""Are you following me?""
""Go home.""
Messages appeared one after another, each cutting deeper than the last.
Georgina wrapped her arm around his and smiled sweetly. ""Zach, who's this? A friend of yours?""
Then she leaned closer, pouting playfully. ""Can you ask her to let me have that outfit? I really like it.""
Zachary gave her a soft, indulgent smile.
Without hesitation, he patted her hand reassuringly, pulled out his own card, and handed it to the cashier to pay.
""She's just a friend.""
The words hit Rebecca like a block of ice. Her whole body went cold, and she could barely stay standing.
Her three years of marriage were reduced to a single word—""friend.""
The ceiling lights flickered and buzzed faintly. She instinctively looked up just as one of the fixtures came loose.
Just then, there was a loud crash. A sharp pain shot through her back.
For a split second, she felt something warm spreading beneath her. Trembling, she touched it, and her hand came away covered in blood.
The boutique erupted into chaos—screams, phones ringing, people shouting.
But all she saw was Zachary, frantically lifting Georgina into his arms, scanning the room with panic in his eyes.
""Call an ambulance! Hurry!""
Rebecca had never seen him so terrified before.
""Sir, I'm sorry, but could we let this lady go first? The next ambulance is on its way, but her condition is more critical,"" one of the paramedics said.
They carefully lifted the half-conscious Rebecca onto a stretcher, only for Zachary to suddenly step in, his face twisted in anger.
""Save her!"" he barked, pointing at Georgina.
Before anyone could react, he shoved Rebecca off the stretcher. She hit the ground hard, the pain jolting her back to full awareness.
She could only stare in disbelief as Zachary gently placed Georgina onto the stretcher himself.
""Sir, she just sprained her wrist. It's not serious!"" one of the medics protested.
""You're taking up emergency resources for no reason!"" another added sharply.
""Her hands are important! She's a doctor!"" Zachary shot back, his voice firm and protective.
Then he pushed past them, guiding the paramedics toward the ambulance with Georgina inside.
Rebecca stood frozen. It was the longest sentence she had heard from him in two years, yet not a single word was for her.
Leaning weakly against a nearby shelf, she tried to breathe, but every breath tugged at the wound on her back, sending waves of pain through her body.
She couldn't tell which hurt more—the injury or her heart.
Hadn't she given up her own dream of becoming a doctor for him?
And now, somehow, her sacrifice meant nothing, while Georgina's hands were ""important.""
So what did that make her?
Her lips twitched into a hollow, bitter smile.
She was just a friend to him.
Then, everything went dark.
Chapter 3
The first thing Rebecca did when she woke up in the hospital was send a message to Zachary.
""Let's get divorced.""
Moments after hitting send, the door opened, and there he was.
He walked in carrying two shopping bags, both from the same brand she had seen earlier that day.
Without saying a word, he set them on the side table and took a seat beside her bed.
He pulled out his phone, glanced at her message, but his expression didn't change at all.
The silence in the room was suffocating. Then her phone chimed.
It was him.
""You like this brand. I picked two dresses that would suit you.
""When you're discharged, I'll have the boutique send their full collection to the house. You can buy the entire line if you want.
""Gina is a doctor. Her hands mean everything to her work—that's why I panicked. Don't be upset.""
Rebecca stared at the screen as message after message appeared, her vision blurring with tears.
Finally, she couldn't hold it in any longer.
""You can talk to her, so why can't you talk to me? We're sitting right here, and you still have to text me?
""Are you doing this on purpose? Is this your idea of punishment?""
She lifted her head, tears streaming down her face, her voice trembling.
Zachary remained calm, his expression unreadable. After what felt like forever, he lowered his head and typed a single line.
""I'm sorry. I have selective mutism.""
Then, he reached into his pocket and handed her a document, gesturing for her to sign it.
She glanced at it. It was the property transfer for the house they lived in.
""It's compensation.""
Before she could respond, his phone rang sharply. His expression tightened as he answered.
She couldn't hear the voice on the other end, but when he replied, the answer said it all.
""I'll be right there.""
It was Georgina. Rebecca didn't need to guess.
Without hesitation, Rebecca picked up her phone, opened the courthouse's website, and began filing for divorce. She filled in every field—the petition, personal details, and marriage certificate. For proof of separation, she uploaded the property transfer he had just given her and then checked the box that said no mediation.
When she finally pressed submit, she exhaled slowly, as if releasing everything she had been holding in for years.
The screen flashed, ""Processing... 30 days remaining.""
\*\*\*
""3:00 p.m. Property Transfer Center. For the house title transfer.""
After a week in the hospital, Rebecca received a message from Zachary.
During that week, he never called, never texted, and never came by. She was slowly getting used to being alone.
When she finally arrived half an hour late, he was already waiting in the lobby, which surprised her. He had always hated tardiness, yet there was no trace of irritation on his face.
A staff member from the VIP counter immediately came over to greet them. Beside him, she noticed a bouquet of flowers and a small velvet jewelry box. It was clearly expensive.
When the staff reached out to pull out her chair, Zachary stopped them with a quiet gesture and did it himself.
It caught her off guard. After a pause, she said softly, ""You don't have to do all this.""
He gave a faint smile and shook his head. Then, after what seemed like immense effort, he forced out two words.
""It's fine.""
It was the gentlest he had sounded in years.
The paperwork went by quickly.
Then came another text. ""You go home first. I have to work late.""
A strange unease crept up in her chest, growing stronger by the minute.
She stepped outside to hail a cab, then realized she had left her purse behind. Turning back, she reentered the building.
That was when she saw Zachary again. He was still in the lobby, holding an even larger bouquet of roses. Georgina walked in from the entrance.
The moment Zachary saw her, he rushed to meet her. They hugged, and he affectionately patted her head.
""Mr. Petersen, this way, please, to finalize your new property purchase,"" the staff said politely.
""So you'd like to buy an estate, correct? Now that the apartment has been transferred out of your name, it can be exchanged for a larger manor. It'll be perfect for you and Mrs. Petersen to live in comfort.
""Careful, Mrs. Petersen.""
Georgina rested her head lightly on Zachary's shoulder, both of them smiling with quiet happiness as they walked inside together.
It was the middle of July, yet Rebecca had never felt so cold. The chill seeped deep into her bones, until even her breath trembled.
So this was it.
She was the one being erased.
Chapter 4
""Ms. Zamora, your husband, Mr. Petersen, hasn't responded to the divorce summons. We reached him by phone, but he remained silent. Therefore, the court will proceed under the assumption that he agrees to the divorce.
""Your petition has been processed. You have 30 days from the date of submission to withdraw it. If you don't, the marriage will be legally dissolved.""
The clerk's voice was flat and emotionless.
It was just another routine case in a long day of paperwork.
Rebecca took a deep breath. Her hands trembled slightly as she replied, ""Understood.""
She took a cab home, standing quietly in the entryway as she looked around. Then, without hesitation, she began clearing out all of Zachary's belongings. She wasn't planning to move out. She was removing him instead.
A knock on the door interrupted her. ""Mrs. Petersen, you've got a delivery.""
It was a courier, holding a single envelope.
""I'm not Mrs. Petersen anymore,"" she said softly as she took the envelope.
The courier froze, then gave an awkward smile and left.
She opened the envelope. Inside was a handwritten card by Zachary. She flipped it open, and suddenly, a familiar voice played from a tiny recording device embedded inside.
""I miss you. I like you. I love you...""
Before she could react, a hand snatched the card away.
She stumbled back, startled.
She looked up and found that it was Zachary. His expression was dark and cold.
""Don't touch my things.""
Her phone lit up. A message from him appeared.
Before she could respond, he turned and walked downstairs.
""Zachary! You've gone too far!"" she shouted, anger breaking through her restraint.
She ran after him, her footsteps echoing down the stairwell.
""I wasn't going through your stuff! You have no right to treat me like this!
""I don't care what you and your precious Georgina are, but you have no right to humiliate me!""
Then came the screech of tires—the sharp, grating sound of brakes slamming on asphalt.
Pain shot through her side before she could see what hit her. The force threw her into the air, and she crashed hard onto the pavement.
Dazed, she tried to push herself up, but a pair of red high heels stopped in front of her. She looked up into a perfectly made-up face hidden behind dark sunglasses. The heel pressed down right onto her hand.
A raw scream tore from her throat.
As her vision blurred, the last thing she saw was Zachary running toward them, his face stricken with panic. But instead of looking at her, he grabbed Georgina's hand, checking her over anxiously. Only when he saw she was unharmed did he exhale in relief.
Until the moment Rebecca lost consciousness, he never once looked her way.
\*\*\*
""Ms. Zamora, your VIP privileges at the Petersen Hospital have been revoked. I'm afraid we'll have to move you to a regular single room.""
A moment later, the nurse returned, looking uncomfortable. ""I'm sorry, I just checked. There are no single rooms available either. You might need to wait for surgery in the hallway.
""And about your right hand... The injury is quite severe. You'll need immediate surgery. Otherwise, you might lose the ability to perform any fine movements in the future.""
The words snapped through the fog in Rebecca's mind like ice water.
""Z-Zachary... where is he?
""My phone... Give me my phone...""
She struggled to sit up, fumbling for it with her uninjured hand.
""The number you've dialed is unavailable.""
A broken, muffled cry escaped from deep in Rebecca's throat.
She hurled the phone against the wall. It hit with a sharp crack, the pain in her right hand flaring so violently she could barely breathe.
A nurse rushed in. ""Ms. Zamora, we located Mr. Petersen. He's in the counseling room with Dr. Schwartz. She was apparently traumatized by the incident. Mr. Petersen gave strict orders not to be disturbed.""
Rebecca covered her eyes with her left hand, her tears mixing with the blood seeping from her bandaged wrist, soaking through her sleeve.
""I hate you...
""I hate you so much, Zachary!""
Chapter 5
Rebecca spent the entire night in the hallway, clinging to the pain pump just to stay conscious, before finally being taken in for surgery.
Pain consumed her body, so deep and relentless it numbed her.
""I'm sorry, Ms. Zamora,"" the doctor said softly. ""Your right hand suffered a comminuted fracture, and because surgery was delayed, some of the muscle tissue has necrosed. You may never be able to lift heavy objects again.""
He gave her a strained smile.
""I understand you studied medicine yourself... I'm afraid you may never hold a scalpel again.
""You could talk to Mr. Petersen. The Petersen family has strong ties in the medical field. If you went abroad, there might still be a chance.""
Rebecca shook her head. She stared at her bandaged hand, unable even to curl her fingers.
""Can you help me buy a new phone?"" she asked weakly. ""I want to call the police.""
Before the doctor could respond, the door burst open with a loud bang.
Zachary walked in.
His face was pale and tense, but when his eyes fell on her, hooked up to IV lines, wrapped in bandages, something in his expression softened for a brief moment.
He opened his mouth, but no words came out. Instead, he grabbed a pen and a sheet of paper from the bedside table.
""I didn't know your injury was this bad. I'll contact specialists overseas for your hand.""
Rebecca let out a short, bitter laugh.
""No need. I can handle my own recovery.""
His brows furrowed slightly, displeased with her tone.
She wanted to bring up the divorce, but after a moment's thought, she realized there was no point.
He reached into his jacket pocket and pulled out a checkbook, scribbling a number before placing it on the table.
""This is compensation. Please don't blame Gina.""
The moment she saw that name, her whole body began to shake uncontrollably.
""Get out! I don't want to see you again, Zachary!"" she shouted, voice raw.
""I don't care who Georgina is! I'm calling the police! I don't need your money!""
She snatched the check from the table, tore it in half, and threw the pieces at his chest.
He froze, as if he had never seen her this furious before.
Then he picked up the pen again. ""I won't let you hurt Gina.""
The words pierced her like a blade, sinking deep where nothing could reach.
He turned and walked out, leaving her trembling from head to toe.
""Ten more days,"" she whispered to the empty room. ""Just ten more days, and we'll finally be over.""
\*\*\*
""Ms. Zamora, these flowers are from Mr. Petersen,"" the nurse said softly.
It had been the third day in a row that Zachary sent flowers. Rebecca didn't bother to look at them. She only gave a faint, polite reply.
Leaning on her crutch, she packed up her things. She was ready to leave the hospital.
But the moment she opened the door, she froze. The entire corridor was filled with roses—an endless sea of them, identical to the ones he had sent earlier.
Her heart skipped a beat. How did he know she was being discharged today?
The answer came a second later, shattering the fragile illusion.
""I heard Mr. Petersen of the Petersen Group is so thoughtful. He didn't want Dr. Schwartz to feel awkward, so he sent flowers to every room in the hospital and completely redecorated the entire floor she's staying on.""
""It must cost thousands of dollars a day. That's how the rich fall in love, I guess.""
""Shh! Keep your voice down! Mrs. Petersen is in this hospital too.""
Rebecca steadied herself against the wall. Her face was pale as she let out a dry, bitter laugh.
A commotion downstairs drew her attention. She leaned over the railing, and her breath caught.
The hospital lobby was covered in roses, drenched in red. In the middle of it all stood Zachary and Georgina.
""Gina, will you stay with me forever?"" Zachary asked, dropping to one knee with a ring in hand.
Georgina blushed shyly as she accepted the ring box from his hand, while everyone around them clapped and cheered.
Zachary smiled, then leaned in and kissed her.
Rebecca's fingers brushed against her own lips. How long had it been since he last touched her?
Maybe more than a thousand days and nights? She couldn't even keep count anymore. Living with Zachary, she had learned he wasn't just mute—he was obsessively clean.
At that moment, Rebecca felt like the whole world was a ridiculous stage play.
Her ex-husband, the man with selective mutism, had just gone on air to publicly declare his love for his ex-girlfriend.
So this was the truth—not loving someone was the only real sin.
Chapter 6
Rebecca spent the rest of the afternoon running errands—buying a new phone, filing a police report, and giving her statement.
She also finalized her plans with an overseas education agency—a master's program starting later that year, and a one-way ticket to Switzerland departing in ten days.
Her plan was simple—recover and start over.
By the time she returned home, it was already 7:00 p.m. The half-packed apartment was covered in dust. One look told her Zachary hadn't been back.
After a quick meal, she continued cleaning.
Then came the sound of the front door unlocking. It was Zachary.
He stepped inside, his face as cold and distant as ever. Still, something about her seemed to catch him off guard—though he couldn't tell what.
Without a word, he went straight to the bedroom. Moments later, the sound of drawers slamming and boxes opening filled the apartment.
He stormed out and tore through the neatly stacked clothes and boxes she had organized.
""What are you doing?""
Rebecca moved to stop him, but he pushed her aside so hard she fell to the floor.
""Where's the recorder?""
For a second, she froze. It was the first time she had heard his voice in what felt like forever.
""What recorder? I don't have it,"" she said, glancing down at her right hand. Fresh blood was already seeping through the bandage.
The sound of frantic rummaging continued. Rebecca looked up and realized she had never seen him so disheveled before—his face tense and covered in sweat, his tie loosened, and his jacket smudged with dust.
""Where is it?"" he shouted again.
He stopped and glared down at her from above, eyes burning with something between fury and panic.
""I told you, I haven't seen it!""
It was the first time she had ever raised her voice to him. Using her left hand, she pushed herself off the floor, standing on unsteady legs to meet his gaze.
For a moment, he looked completely unhinged. His fist clenched and unclenched before he suddenly slammed it into the glass sliding door beside him. The pane shattered, scattering shards across the floor.
""My recorder. Where is it?"" he demanded again as he stepped closer.
Blood dripped steadily from his right hand. Rebecca had never seen Zachary so wild and unhinged before.
Summoning what little strength she had left, she shoved him back and stumbled toward the door.
""I'm Zachary Petersen. I'm 18. I want to declare my love for Georgina Schwartz.
""Gina, today marks our second anniversary. I hope we'll always be together.
""Gina, it's been three years now. My wish this year is still the same—that we never part.
""Gina, why did you leave?
""Gina, I'm getting married.""
With a loud crash, Zachary stumbled into a pile of clutter. Something rolled out from the mess and hit the floor—a worn-out voice recorder. Its red light blinked rapidly before a faint voice began to play.
It was Zachary's own voice—letters to Georgina recorded over the years.
""Goodbye, Gina. I hope we meet again.
""Goodbye.
""Goodbye.""
The recorder had been damaged by the fall, and the word goodbye kept looping over and over, sharp and relentless.
Zachary scrambled to his feet and grabbed it, frantically pressing the buttons, but nothing worked.
Rebecca stopped in her tracks. Slowly, she turned around, leaning weakly against the shoe cabinet by the door. Tears streamed down her face, one after another, without sound.
""Zachary,"" she called out. ""If you never loved me, why did you marry me?""
His throat bobbed, his lips parting slightly as if he wanted to speak, but no sound came.
""Let me explain, Bekah.""
A message popped up on her phone.
She closed her eyes, forcing herself to stay calm, swallowing down the ache rising in her chest.
""Leave,"" she said firmly. ""Take your things and get out of my house.""
Zachary pressed his lips tightly together, gripping the recorder in his hand—the one that kept playing the same sentence over and over—and walked past her out the door.
Another message buzzed on her phone just as he left.
""I'm sorry.""
Chapter 7
In the days that followed, Rebecca never saw Zachary again.
Before leaving the country, she had to return to the hospital one last time to have her bandages changed.
The hospital hallway now displayed Georgina's profile among the list of specialists on the first floor. Rebecca glanced at it and froze.
Under publications, she saw something that shocked her—it was her own college thesis.
She checked the title, the publication date, and the format. Everything matched the one she had written years ago.
""Ms. Zamora,"" a soft female voice called from behind.
She turned. It was Georgina.
""Got a minute?""
Georgina tilted her head slightly, gesturing toward the seating area nearby.
Rebecca looked at Georgina. She was, without question, flawless. Her white coat was perfectly pressed, not a wrinkle in sight, and every strand of her wavy hair seemed meticulously styled into place.
Georgina smiled lightly. ""When the clerk from the courthouse called about your divorce, it wasn't Zach who answered. It was me.""
She blinked innocently, a faint look of mock remorse in her eyes.
""I didn't realize that staying silent would mean agreeing to the divorce. You don't blame me, do you, Ms. Zamora?""
Rebecca was silent for a few seconds before shaking her head. ""No. I wanted the divorce. It's better this way.""
But Georgina didn't seem interested in her answer.
She continued smoothly, ""And about that car accident—it really was an accident. I apologized to Zach, and he promised to make sure nothing happened to me. I suppose... you're not planning to make a big deal out of it, right?""
Rebecca met her gaze, saying nothing. Deep down, she knew there were things she couldn't fight—not with the Petersen family's power behind her. Zachary protecting Georgina was no surprise.
""You saw the research paper, didn't you?"" Georgina said, her tone suddenly shifting, eyes glinting.
""Yes. It's exactly what you think. Zach gave it to me himself. He knew I was working on a project and wanted to help.""
She gave a delicate sigh, as though burdened by guilt. ""Thank you for taking care of him these past three years. I was abroad doing research and couldn't be there. I only found out later that my sudden departure was what caused his selective mutism.""
Then, as if brushing off the thought, she smiled sweetly.
""Since I came back, he's already gotten much better.""
Rebecca lowered her eyes, absently stirring her coffee.
""So you came here to show off how much Zachary loves you?"" she asked softly, setting the spoon down. Then she tipped the cup back and drained the bitter black coffee in one gulp.
""There's no need. I don't care about Zachary's past, his present, or his future. I'm done with him. I don't like a man who can't speak.
""I hope you take good care of the man I left behind.""
Rebecca ignored her completely and stood up, heading straight for the payment counter.
""Ms. Zamora!""
Apparently displeased with her indifference, Georgina got up as well and reached out to grab her right hand.
Pain shot up Rebecca's arm as Georgina's grip tightened over her still-healing wound. She yanked her hand away with all her strength.
There was a sharp thud.
Out of the corner of her eye, Rebecca caught a familiar tall figure—Zachary.
He rushed forward, helping Georgina up from where she had stumbled against the railing.
""I'm fine, Zach,"" Georgina said softly, brushing it off. ""I just lost my balance for a second.""
Rebecca stopped for only a moment, then turned to leave. But before she could take another step, a stinging slap landed across her face.
A sharp slap echoed through the hospital corridor, drawing the attention of nearby patients and staff.
Zachary seemed taken aback.
""You...""
He stared at his own hand, but then, his face hardened again.
""Apologize,"" he ordered.
Rebecca pressed a trembling hand to her burning cheek and laughed.
Every time Zachary truly spoke to her, it was always about Georgina.
What did she lack that Georgina had? It didn't even matter anymore.
""Zach! How could you hit Ms. Zamora?
""It's alright, Zach. She doesn't need to apologize,"" Georgina said gently, slipping her arm around his as if nothing had happened. Her tone was soft, practiced.
And just like that, the ice around Zachary began to melt again.
Once, Rebecca had believed that if she were patient and thoughtful enough, he would eventually accept her.
And that if she studied every medical text she could find, his selective mutism would one day be cured.
She used to dream of that moment.
But the truth was, Zachary had never belonged to her at all.
Chapter 8
Rebecca's flight to Switzerland was scheduled for 4:00 p.m.
At noon, she received the official divorce decree from the courthouse. From that moment on, Rebecca was finally free.
""1:00 p.m. this afternoon. Café downstairs at the office. Let's meet.""
It was a message from Zachary.
After a moment's hesitation, she decided to go.
With her suitcase in one hand and the divorce papers in the other, she arrived early and waited.
She waited from 1:00 p.m. to 2:30 p.m., but he never came.
He was the one who had asked to meet, yet he never showed.
She sent him several messages, but none were answered. At last, a short, curt reply appeared on her screen.
""Busy.""
\*\*\*
""Hello, is this Ms. Zamora?"" A man's voice came through the phone.
""I'm Mr. Petersen's assistant, Brandon Reynolds. He asked me to let you know that something urgent came up, and he can't make it to meet you today.""
Rebecca didn't respond. Somehow, she had already expected this.
""Mr. Petersen also wanted me to tell you that he's arranged for a top specialist in England who focuses on hand bone and muscle reconstruction. He'll coordinate everything for your treatment.
""And he's also transferred three million dollars to your account. It's to cover your medical expenses and living costs.""
Rebecca held the phone in one hand, her suitcase in the other, and stood up slowly.
The word ""unnecessary"" was on the tip of her tongue, but before she could say it, she looked up.
Across the street, at an outdoor café, sat Zachary and Georgina. They were laughing.
Georgina smiled shyly as he brushed a loose strand of hair from her face.
That afternoon sunlight was soft and golden, wrapping the two of them in warmth. Zachary hadn't looked that happy in all the three years she had known him.
She stopped herself from thinking further.
""Ms. Zamora? Are you still there?"" Brandon's voice crackled through the line.
She didn't answer. She simply ended the call, paid for her drink, and walked straight out.
Crossing the street, she approached their table, her steps firm and steady.
Without a word, she slammed the divorce decree down in front of them. The impact sent juice and coffee splashing across the table and onto Georgina's dress.
Zachary immediately grabbed her wrist, stopping her. He didn't even glance at the papers.
After a few tense seconds, he seemed to realize that arguing with her was pointless. He released her, stepped around the table, and gently dabbed at Georgina's skirt with a napkin.
""Are you alright, Gina?"" he asked softly.
Rebecca stood there for a long moment before hailing a cab to the airport.
""Passengers bound for Switzerland, please proceed to check-in at Gate T1.""
Her phone buzzed. A new message from Zachary appeared. ""Rebecca, you owe Gina an apology.""
Without hesitation, she blocked the number and deleted the message.
At the security counter, she handed over her ID, passport, and visa documents.
The officer glanced at her paperwork and raised an eyebrow.
""You just finalized a divorce today?""
She lifted her suitcase onto the belt and smiled faintly. ""Yes.""
The plane cabin was cold. She asked for a cashmere blanket, wrapped herself in it, and fell asleep before the takeoff announcement ended.
Only one thought echoed quietly in her mind.
""Zachary, goodbye.""

We are all Incredibly close like more than family because of relating on a lot of family trauma and issues that we’ve almost all been through. It’s three guys and one girly who I still care about a lot but she has always been very on and off with me. She’s been there forever too longer than I have by two more years but also by being in the same hometown knowing them from afar. 

She has always dealt with medical issues and immune system being weak. So I didn’t think much of it whenever she’s back out on our plans of craft dates or coffee dates. But now it’s been so consistent and bold whenever she backs out or even makes her bf say no to outings and plans as a group just because “no babe I don’t feel like doing that”. He’d even be super up for it but when he’d turn & see her making an annoyed face he’d say nevermind. Now even whenever we do go out to eat or hang ill be by her side and be super interested & invested in her stories of work life & even other friend school drama (even with adhd), but I notice anytime I start to respond with relatable stories she immediately looks around & starts talking to others & ignoring me. Then when she sees I notice she blames it on “oh girl I’m so exhausted & fatigue to be present rn I’m probably gonna leave early” and takes off. She is big on self care & being blunt…but almost mean whenever she’s just “being honest”. Whenever I’m or another guy in the group with adhd gets too loud laughing she goes “Stop shhh”. 

I notice she gets annoyed a lot & is very catered to by her family & comes from wealth…She literally denied coming over to my house because it may make her sick, which I actually understand totally and idk if I’m being rude because her health is definitely more important & I still care for her because sometimes she can be very nice to me & I think we relate a lot on crafts & creative ideas but idk if she gets bothered by me because often she does come off as she’d rather be more consistent with her other friends than try with me at all. She even reached out to me first finally to make plans saying let’s hang soon again. But I went to visit her at work (coffee shop) & tried to solidify plans and she said “oh I always do this I over book myself so I’ll let you know I don’t wanna exhaust and overwhelm myself” and I just said sure because again blowing me off wasn’t new. 

So idk am I being too rude, and not being considerate of the fact maybe she’s this way because she can at any point get really sick so she kinda has a idgaf mentality? I’d get it but also idk, I’m desperate to be her friend closer but also don’t know if I’m just beating a dead horse and should just leave it as is. I want a close girl friend so badly because I have none, I’m usually very shy. Idk what to do",2,1763267948.0,AITA_Relationships,1,1.0,False

Six months ago I was mid-sentence on a poem, *the* poem, when my lungs decided to quit. Asthma diagnosis, July 2025. Being a law student, my timetable which used to be filled with writing sprints, programming marathon and law-school deadlines was replaced by inhalers, doctor appointments, bills, and the terror of forgetting meds to be taken as they piling up I’d already taken.

I’m the guy who’s been ten things at once since childhood: writer, poet, programmer, law student, artist. In January of this year, I started creating templates. As a Notion Creator, throughout the year I built **WritersOS** to stop losing novel drafts. **PoetryOS** to cradle fragile lines. **BookOS** after I lent *The Alchemist* and forgot to whom. **PolymathOS** to juggle every passion without drowning. **InfluencerOS** which actually allowed me to hit 200k people in two weeks.

But none of those systems could track *oxygen*.

So I built **HealthOS,** not as a product, but as oxygen for my own ambitions. It started as a single Notion page to track at what time what meds were to be taken as the pile grew beyond what I could keep track of. Slowly, It grew into the dashboard I open *before* my morning pages, because health is the first draft of everything else.

# What HealthOS Actually Has (Built From My Own Panic Attacks & Triumphs)

* **Symptom Tracker** \- Daily symptom logging with trigger analysis and pattern recognition
* **Medication & Treatment Log** \- Prescription tracking, adherence monitoring, and side effect documentation
* **Appointments & Care Team** \- Medical visit scheduling, test results storage, and care coordination
* **Diagnosis & Condition Hub** \- Complete condition registry with timeline and monitoring dashboard
* **Diet & Nutrition** \- Food sensitivity tracking and meal planning aligned with health goals
* **Exercise & Physical Activity** \- Mobility logging, therapy progress, and safe exercise routines
* **Mental Health & Emotional Well-being** \- Mood tracking, stress monitoring, and coping strategies
* **Insurance & Health Costs** \- Coverage overview, bill tracking, and expense management
* **Personal Health Goals** \- Progress milestones and achievement tracking for motivation
* **Support Network** \- Caregiver coordination and family communication tools

It’s all in Notion (duplicate → tweak → ignore what doesn’t fit). Comes with inbuilt onboarding guide for fog-brain days and starter databases for arthritis, diabetes and migraines.

# The Real Win?

I finished the poem.  
Was finally able to start growing as Notion Creator.  
Wrote my very own Virtual Assistant Software Code.  
Then shipped a law-school paper *and* two internships in a single month.

HealthOS didn’t cure asthma, it gave me **predictability**. And predictability is rocket fuel for creators.

I tend to enjoy working late at night. Often, I listen to lofi channels while I work. After so long, I ended up making my own lofi video, inspired by horror, with the attempt to capture a specific late night moment. 

Inside, candlelight dances. The TV hums with late-night news and infomercials. Steam rises from a hot cup of coffee. The radio plays softly in the background. All is peaceful and calm.

Outside, a streetlight flickers, revealing someone (or something) beneath it. Trees sway. Clouds drift. A car slowly passes. A figure stands outside the open window, waiting for the right moment.

I watched a lot of horror movies growing up, obviously. I spent many hours in my room, drawing at my desk, convinced someone was outside my window. This was my attempt to capture that feeling. Let me know what you think.",0,1763267466.0,TheNightFeeling,1,0.33,False
1oycen5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1oycen5/feeling_trapped_at_home_and_it_is_draining_me/,Feeling trapped at home and it is draining me. Advice?,"I am 22F, living at home while commuting to college, and my home environment is taking a huge toll on me. I feel like I am only “allowed” to go to class and the gym. Anything else, like studying at a coffee shop, dog sitting, or visiting my sister, is met with coldness, guilt, the silent treatment, or heavy questioning. It genuinely feels like I am punished for leaving the house.

My mom is retired and never leaves, so everything I do gets questioned. It often feels like she is waiting to catch me doing something wrong. For example, I came home from dog sitting last weekend and she asked why I had makeup on in a tone like she had uncovered something. I told her I was not wearing any makeup and she physically touched my eyelashes to check. I am 22 and it feels like having a normal social life is treated as something forbidden.

Premed is hard on its own, but dealing with this at home makes it feel a hundred times harder. I keep telling myself that one day I will look back and be grateful that I pushed through it or that everything happens for a reason, but right now it feels incredibly tough.

If anyone has gone through something similar or has any advice on coping while living at home, I would really appreciate it. I know there will be a light at the end of the tunnel, but it is hard to see from here. 💔",1,1763267350.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

I successfully installed macOS on my Dell OptiPlex 3060 SFF, but I'm having trouble getting the HDMI port to work. DisplayPort works perfectly, but macOS won't detect my HDMI display at all.

**Hardware:**

* **Model:** Dell OptiPlex 3060 SFF (Small Form Factor)
* **CPU:** Intel Core i5-8500 (Coffee Lake)
* **iGPU:** Intel UHD Graphics 630
* **RAM:** 8GB
* **macOS Version:** macOS Tahoe (26.x)

**Video Ports on motherboard:**

* 1x DisplayPort (working ✓)
* 1x HDMI (not detected ✗)
* 1x VGA (not using)

**What I've Tried:**

* HDMI port works perfectly in Windows, so it's not a hardware issue
* Tested multiple busid values (0x01, 0x04, 0x05, 0x06, 0x00, 0x02)
* Tried both HDMI connector type (`00080000`) and DisplayPort type (`00040000`)
* Swapped con0 and con1 configurations
* Used various framebuffer IDs (`07009B3E` which boots successfully, `0300913E` which black screens)
* Enabled WhateverGreen debug flags (`-igfxdbg -igfxfbdump`) but no useful output

DisplayPort shows up fine, but HDMI doesn't appear in System Preferences → Displays at all.

**Question:** Has anyone successfully gotten dual displays working on a Dell OptiPlex 3060 (or similar Coffee Lake Dell system) with the iGPU? What framebuffer patches did you use?
