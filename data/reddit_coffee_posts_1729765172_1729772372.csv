BestSelf plans to move forward with a long-planned affordable housing project near Buffalo's Central Park neighborhood early next year.

The 66-unit Manhattan Village building at 389 Manhattan Ave. was [first approved](https://www.bizjournals.com/buffalo/news/2020/11/23/bestself-sacrifices-one-program-to-boost-approval.html) in 2020. Rising construction costs and a development team shakeup have slowed the path to the groundbreaking, according to Steven Walters, chief administration and legal officer for BestSelf.

The city planning board this week approved a one-year extension for the project, its fourth.

Originally announced as a $15 million project, rising construction costs have increased the price tag to about $27 million. The development team needed to seek additional funding sources to close the gap, Walters said.

The second part of Lancaster Village Center is rising on West Main Street, two years after the [first phase](https://www.bizjournals.com/buffalo/news/2022/11/15/lancaster-village-center-glassco-management.html) opened.

Like its counterpart across the street, the three-story building will have commercial space on the first floor and 18 apartments above.

All the commercial spaces are already spoken for, showing the strong demand for retail space in the Village of Lancaster, said Tom Sweeney, owner of Glassco Management.

""All of them have been rented since the beginning,"" Sweeney said. ""We have a very strong community and a very strong desire to lease on that corridor.""

The Lincoln has opened in the Village of Ellicottville, giving the region another hospitality option just in time for the fall and winter ski season.

The site was developed by Route Two Nineteen LLC as a [high-end boutique motel](https://www.bizjournals.com/buffalo/news/2024/06/24/lincoln-pour-taproom-new-ellicottville-hotel-rest.html) at 6089 Route 219 and includes 12 rooms and two [Airbnb](https://www.bizjournals.com/buffalo/organization/airbnb) suites.

[Community voices concerns at Voelker's Lanes redevelopment meeting](https://www.wkbw.com/news/local-news/buffalo/do-this-the-right-way-community-voices-concerns-at-voelkers-lanes-redevelopment-meeting)

On Monday afternoon the Buffalo City Planning Board put a pause on the request for the PUD so that developers could focus on the community's opinion.

Currently, the public is most concerned about street parking near their homes and how more people on the dead-end streets will impact the traffic patterns.

Councilmember Golombek hopes to find a compromise so the residents are happy and the developer continues to try to revitalize the area.

[Buffalo Central Terminal: $300M plan to revive shuttered station gains momentum - Buffalo Business First](https://www.bizjournals.com/buffalo/news/2024/10/22/central-terminal-buffalo-development-history.html?utm_source=st&utm_medium=en&utm_campaign=me&utm_content=BU&ana=e_BU_me&j=37166244&senddate=2024-10-22&empos=p1)

It's been 45 years since the last train rattled out of Buffalo's Central Terminal.

The imposing Art Deco building on the East Side has been vacant ever since. Renovation and revitalization plans have been discussed ever since that last train left, with little to show for it so far.

However, [momentum is building](https://www.bizjournals.com/buffalo/news/2024/02/08/central-terminal-development-team-buffalo-east.html). Construction is underway, money is pouring in, and while it will likely be years before the complex is occupied again, a $300 million plan is closer to fruition than ever before.

(The rest of this article gives a great run down of the history of developing the terminal)

A controversial proposal by Alliance Homes for a 60-unit apartment project along Southwestern Boulevard in Hamburg is back before town planning officials for potential approval, after the Town Board agreed to rezone the property last month.

Alliance, through ARR Holdings, wants to develop a five-building apartment complex on a narrow 13-acre sliver of land along Southwestern, at the northeast corner of Howard Drive.

When the New York City-based nonprofit Tunnel to Towers Foundation sought to prioritize where to put one of its new Veterans Village housing projects, Western New York stood out.

... ""Western New York has one of those great needs,"" said Matthew Mahoney, executive vice president of the foundation, whose mission is to help care for and house military veterans, first-responders and their families. ""We know the numbers that are in the area.""

... It also found a site that kills two birds with one stone, by purchasing the derelict former Manor Oak Skilled Nursing Facility at 3600 Harlem Road, with plans to tear it down and construct a three-story building in its place, in a $12 million project that is entirely privately funded.

[Sewer project jams traffic near Amherst Costco site](https://buffalonews.com/news/local/business/development/amherst-costco-site-sewer-project-traffic-restrictions/article_f89812ce-907a-11ef-91a9-0ba8134c2a2a.html)

It’s getting harder to travel around one of the busiest shopping centers in Erie County’s northern suburbs – but don’t blame Costco for it.

At least not yet.

A project to expand sewer capacity along the Niagara Falls Boulevard corridor in Amherst has narrowed a key roadway near The Boulevard retail center and the future site of the region’s first Costco Wholesale store to a single lane, a restriction that is expected to remain in place through the holiday season.

The lane restriction on North Bailey Avenue near Ridge Lea Road likely will cause traffic backups. But town officials say the sewer expansion is sorely needed, and they’re doing their best to limit the effect on motorists.",1,1729772068.0,Buffalo,1,1.0,False

I love dogs 100% but cats 101% .that’s about it nothing special . Life has been feeling kind of pointless recently and I’m hoping to find someone that makes me abit more excited to be alive everyday ( I know sounds like a big ask )

-Goodmorning messages (might not be sent in the morning )
-a lot of random playlist I’ve made 
-complaints about nonsensical things

-someone to have coffee dates with virtually

I remarried a couple years ago and the Mrs. was definitely not happy with it though. The dreaded Sette jet engine noise was simply too much for her. She finally put her foot down a few weeks ago and gave me an ultimatum. My gorgeous  Atom 75W was the result of the compromise. :) 

I have been watching the broader grinder market the past couple years waiting for GBW to be more mainstream in the offerings and I had pretty much settled on this grinder. My plan was to wait until after the holidays, but hey when the wifey says do something about that noise, what's a good husband to do. I pulled my first shot with it this morning expecting to burn through some coffee trying to get this thing dialed in. Much to my surprise the very first pull came out perfecty, 18g in / 36g out in 27s. Exactly what I aim for. The best part when I ground my second shot so the lil lady could see/hear it in action, she got a big smile on her face and said wow, that changes the entire vibe in the house this morning with the lack of that jet engine taking off. It's super quiet and very fast. A bonus win for both of us is I am able to retire two of my countertop contraptions - that godawful (her words) WDT tool and my dosing funnel. I'm a very happy camper and it was my wife's idea to boot! Oh the output...that first cup was wonderful, very balanced and a lightness to it that I didn't recall from the Sette. Whether that was due to the difference in burr type or a confirmation bias, I really enjoyed it.

Long story short I was at my wits end with it. I tried everything electrolyte tabs, taking it before food, taking it after food, trying with different combinations of protein, carbs and fats, splitting the dose, increasing and decreasing dose etc but nothing got it to work consistently. It barely lasted 3/4 hours and made me exhausted. 

But I ran out out my electrolytes and decided to try some from Amazon. The only ones available next day were labelled as extra strength and I was scared but bought them anyway. I tried them last night before taking my usual final third of my split dose, thinking nothing of it but my god an hour later I felt like I did on dex but with slightly more mental clarity. I took it really late because it usually doesn't last long but I was up pretty much all night. 

I thought this would be a good time to test it on minimal sleep as it's meant to not be effective without adequate sleep. Also wanted to see if it would work as one dose rather than splitting. Added the Amazon electrolyte tablets to my vitamin stack and had my 70mg in one dose and I'm shocked its been 7 hours and it's still working???? Before I could barely rely on it for 4/5 and that's if I split it and drank a shit tonne of coffee. 

It explains a lot because I've always had oily skin and not I'm finding it's really really dry. I put on three moisturiser but never thought I might be really dehydrated as I drink a lot of water. I'll update after a week or so if anyone is interested 

TL;DR Believe the hype about electrolytes helping to make your meds work better. Even if you're taking them make sure they're not shitty as you might still be super dehydrated like I am.

As you can see, you can track progress for camos of **MP/Zombies and Warzone** aswell as Multiplayer and Zombies Challenges, below that are the Prestige Challenges (that aren't complete yet because i actually need to grind thoses level myself)

This next picture show what the camo page looks like for MP/Zombies and Warzone.

You can track also your progress with the progress bar on top of the page to be even more satisfied when you're hitting the 100% camo mark!

This is similar to the dashboard and also to the next tab which is the Prestige Challenges, you can track your progress on the left side of the dashboard.

And this year new and improved mastery challenges are the **Mastery Badges**, quite a lot to unpack and to grind, here's a look.

So ive been dating my gf for 3 years and things have had been pretty damn good. No real arguments and any issues we resolve via communication. I do everything in my power for her and she appreciates everything and also does her best for me. She lives in a different city at the moment but we see each other 10-15 days a month. 
Sex life is great and it feels like it was from the start more or less. 

Not so good part... 

She had a colleague she worked with (M34) that seemed decent enough, they worked together for 4 months with another female friend of hers and sometimes went for coffee or brunch. No issues. 
I seen however he had messaged her while I was on her phone watching a video on meditation she told me to watch. We have access to each others codes but neither really check cause non of us felt there could ever be anything. As i was watching the video a message from the guy popped up with 5 laughing emojis. 
I opened the message to see what the joke was and well, it wasnt so funny. 
He had sent her a message of him massaging a woman from a while back, and she had replied something like “ohhhh u looked so different!” 
“I want a fuuuull massage” 
In which his response was the laughing emojis. 
So i decided to scroll a little bit and found more.
He had bought her a gift from his holiday (like a rock or pendant or something didnt get to read it properly) which she hadnt even told me about. 
And another text from her to him with eye emojis at 11pm, which he replies “yeah, i just showered 😂” 
In which she replies “me too hahaha”. 

That was enough for one time to take in and i just left it there trying to get my  head together. I was leaving the day after and i tried not to show any emotions regarding it and left as normal but... i dont know what to think. She has always told me whenever anyone messages her or anything but not this time. 
Honestly idk what to think, i trusted her a lot but this has got me thinking. I could be over reacting its maybe nothing but regardless we have boundries set and in my eyes this has crossed them. 
I sincerely care about this girl and she always showed me that she did too but this doesnt sit well at all. Its crossed our level of boundaries.  

Is this relationship worth pursuing and building on or shall i cut my losses now and move on while i can? (no kids or marriage yet).",2,1729771020.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

No medications; I take multivitamins, fiber supplements, and fish oil

Pre-diabetic, but otherwise clean comprehensive blood panel as of late June.

I've lost almost 60lbs in about 18 months. I was eating at a pretty consistent caloric deficit, but without paying enough attention to actual nutrition. I'm trying to correct that now, but I can't figure out why the left side of my face keeps twitching (eye and upper cheek).

I remember noticing the twitching getting worse around May. But it can stay for a day and then quiet the next. I can't really figure out any rhythm to it. 

At first, I thought too much coffee. I've cut that down to just one day a week. I work out 3-4 days a week, so I thought maybe electrolytes. I salt my morning water and try to have a sports drink after a workout, but it twitched a lot today even though I haven't worked out in four days. I've been getting better with my sleeping habits too, as I thought that may have been a factor. Even when I'm slept up, it twitches (like today). Even Googling stuff like calcium deficiency can have that symptom, and I was eating hardly any dairy, so I have cheese sticks with breakfast regularly. Even when I work more potassium (bananas and spinach) into my diet, I've noticed the twitching.

I can't figure out what causes it to start or stop. Where would you look next? Could it have anything to do with blood sugar? I have doc appointments scheduled but after New Years.

At first we’ve dated for 2 years and she broke up with me, I went nc then she reached out after 9 months, we’ve been on and off with communication for a year due to COVID and college, we met for coffee like 7 times since she made contact and eventually got back together 2 years after the 1st breakup. She never been with anyone during the break up, she told me she could not connect with anyone. 

We’ve been dating for 2.5 years (the 2nd round) and moved in together after 1 year. The relationship was overall good. Over the past couple of months we’ve been arguing at least once a week and decided mutually to break up. After a week I told her that I want to try and repair our relationship, she told me she made up her mind and that she think we’re not bad people but just not compatible. 

It’s been a month since the breakup and we communicate only business, stuff that related to our apartment and bills (I’m looking for a new place) I’m not initiating contact but I communicate respectfuly when she does. The communication is positive, and she’s doing small gestures from time to time. It seems like she really moved on, no bad feelings. I think we have a lot of potential but it seems like she made up her mind. I’ll probably move out soon and it will be the end for good. 

I’ll go nc for my healing but wanted to know if you think there’s any hope for rekindling things…

“I came because I actually wanted to talk to you about the borealis in the ice kingdom.” Strider replied as he lightly punched Steelblade’s shoulder. “Cypress thought it’d be an interesting trip for the dragonets.” 

“With who knows how long until the next one?” Steelblade continued the thought. Nitride saw the seawing flying next to the steelwing nod. “Maybe we can use this as the crew-wide vacation we’ve talked about on occasion.” He joked. Nitride could hear a chuckle come from Strider. 

“You just saying that as an excuse to no longer be on Dawnbreaker’s bad side.” The seawing said with a laugh, earning a chuckle from everyone else. 

“Maybe. Maybe not.” Steelblade replied with a chuckle. 

“Do you both think the dragonets will be able to handle the cold?” Meerkat cut in, slight worry in her voice. 

“Turtle said Queen Snowfall had started a project to allow bigger groups of other tribes to visit.” Nitride’s hybrid father replied from her right, apparently being the knowledgeable one on the subject. “And it kicked into overdrive with the borealis.” Boron added on. 

“Plus.” Nitride’s icewing father cut in from her left. He had fallen a bit behind when they took off but quickly caught up. “Snowfall had actually invited the entire crew to see it.” Icesurge said as he dug out a letter from the pouch around his neck. “One of her messengers stopped me right before I could jump into the sky with you.” 

“See.” Steelblade said to his wife with a reassuring tone. “I doubt the queen would send an invite to the whole crew without being sure it was safe.” 

“Did she take into account dragonets?” Meerkat asked Icesurge, attempting to ignore her husband. Nitride could tell it was failing from the slight smirk she had on her snout, one that only showed when Steelblade’s antics started breaking her seriousness. 

“Yup.” Icesurge replied as he flew up to her and handed her the letter. Meerkat took the letter and Icesurge flew back to Nitride’s left. 

“See.” Steelblade said as he saw the part that mentioned the next generation of the crew. “They’ll be fine.” 

“And when has that ever been true?” Meerkat retorted, the smirk on her facing getting bigger as she joked with her husband. 

“Can you think of some world ending catastrophe that could actually start from this?” Strider cut in for Steelblade. “Talon’s dead squared. So there’s no way he could come back.” Meerkat’s only response was shooting the seawing an annoyed look. She was being outnumbered. 

“Why would the queen invite us and our dragonets if it wasn’t safe for them?” Steelblade pressed further. Nitride watched as Meerkat let out a sigh of defeat. 

“Alright.” Meerkat said after a minute. Steelblade gave Strider a high five before she continued. “But if something happens, I’m killing you.” She joked as she moved her head closer to Steelblade’s, a teasing look in her eyes. Nitride could hear a soft growl of excitement from the steelwing. 

“If you beat Cypress and Canary to it.” He teased as he moved his head closer to Meerkat’s. 

“Mom! Dad!” Aster said with a disgusted expression causing laughter from the rest. “Don’t you think you two show each other enough affection already?” Aster wasn’t the only one who noticed the sandwing and steelwing were getting close to making out. 

“Nope.” Steelblade joked and he brushed his wing with Meerkat’s. “A dragon like your mother is a once in a lifetime miracle.” 

“And your father’s seven thousand years old.” Strider added on. Nitride could barely continue her laughter at her uncle’s face of sheer disgust. Even though a question that made her guilty of even thinking it lingered in the back of her mind. *What is it like having a mother?* She thought subconsciously. She shook her head violently with guilt at the thought. She loved her fathers and the rest of her family. She didn’t need a mother when she had a family that loved her and parents that worked hard to raise her. 

They arrived at Jade Mountain a few hours later. 

“Strider?” Sunny said as they all landed. “Wasn’t told to be expecting you.” 

“Wanted to talk with boss about a crew-wide vacation.” The seawing replied. 

“Dad!” Nitride heard Jellyfish’s voice as she slammed into Strider to hug him. 

“Hey there kiddo.” Strider chuckled as he hugged his daughter. Not a moment after, Nitride’s aunt slammed herself into Steelblade and Meerkat’s arms while her younger uncle gracefully climbed them. 

“Well you haven’t gotten any reckless.” Steelblade joked as he wrapped one of his wings around his daughter. Nitride noticed that Stingray was farther behind as he was carrying some bags. 

“Did you leave Stingray to carry all of your stuff?” Meerkat scolded the dragonets softly. 

“No.” Steelstorm said, trying to hide the mischief in his eyes. 

“Yes.” Stingray cut in before he let the bags rest to hug his father. 

“When did you become a mischievous rascal?” Steelblade joked as he scooped up Steelstorm with his wing. “You were always the shy, easygoing dragonet.” 

“He and Stingray molded to fit with their winglet.” Tsunami said as she approached the group. “The rest of their winglet were basically carbon copies of Qibli.” She said with an annoyed tone. 

“They didn’t get into trouble like Qibli’s winglet did however.” Sunny countered the seawing princess. 

“Not exactly easy to one up them.” Tsunami snorted. 

“I bet Sonora’s continent wide search for boss’s memories made a good competitor.” Strider joked. 

“Oh don’t get me started on that.” Tsunami groaned. “I don’t know how many debates were about which winglet stopped the bigger threat after that happened.” She got a laugh out of the restaurant dragons while Sunny tried to hide her laughter. 

“Well sorry to cut this visit short.” Steelblade said as he picked up some bags. “But we got a vacation in the ice kingdom to get ready for.” 

“Vacation in the ice kingdom?” Sonora echoed with curiosity. 

“The borealis Turtle mentioned?” Sunny asked, a knowing tone. 

“Yup.” Strider replied as he picked up the rest of the bags. “Whole crew’s goin.” 

“Sounds fun.” Tsunami grunted tiredly. 

“Need coffee?” Steelblade offered with a joking tone. 

“More than I already drink.” Tsunami replied, a smirk breaking the frown she had. 

“I can make you some stronger stuff and send it over if you want.” Steelblade chuckled. 

“I wouldn’t say no.” Tsunami replied. Steelblade nodded with a chuckle before he took to the sky. The rest of them followed. 

“Have fun!” Sunny called after them as they started their flight back to Possibility.

Here are some highlights from the AMA:

**Comment 1:**
*Original Comment:*
>Any specifics on how you plan to combat high rent?

*Reply by Emma Curtis:*
>Yes!

First off, I'm a renter myself and I'm feeling the impacts of our housing crisis on a daily basis.

We have to start holding landlords and property management companies accountable. I'll work towards the creation of an eviction diversion program, guaranteed seats for renters on the civic boards and commissions directly related to housing, and the creation of a rental property registration program. 

I supported the ban on source of income discrimination earlier this year and when the state legislature worked to block our Council from implementing it, I lobbied the legislature along with the ordinance's sponsors (CM Lynch and CM Sevigny) to stop them from blocking it. Unfortunately, those conversations were too little too late.  
  
The biggest lesson that I took from that experience is that we need to be having conversations and working in tandem with the legislature to combat these issues, not getting into political pissing contests.

---

**Comment 2:**
*Original Comment:*
>Do you have a specific plan for how you are going to combat the high rent prices? How are you going to convince the rest of the council to work with you? I would love to see some more transparency from local government but it seems like every city council is too entrenched in nepotism and cliques.

*Reply by Emma Curtis:*
>I spoke on an earlier post about combatting high rent prices, so I'm gonna focus on the latter part of your question here because I do agree with you that there's been a lot of drama and cliqueness on Council (and in every legislative body, for that matter...)

The way we make tangible change is by being vulnerable, acting in good faith, and meeting people where they're at. I'm a renter and I've experienced the impact of high rental costs personally. I have every intention of sharing that experience in detail with my colleagues, should I be lucky enough to serve on Council, and I think that there's real power that comes sharing that lived experience with folks who don't have it themselves.

The majority of our Councilmembers are a bit on the older side and haven't had to deal with this stuff themselves. The truth is that my generation inherited a very different economy and a very different housing market than their generations did. Based on conversations I've had over the past couple of years with several of our current CMs, I do genuinely believe that a lot of decisions are made not out of malice but out of a lack of awareness of the firsthand impact that Council's decisions have on renters.  
  
I'm not interested in nepotism, cliques, or interpersonal drama. If somebody's willing to have a conversation with me, I'm willing to meet them where they're at and have a conversation with them.  
  
It might be a bit old fashioned, but I think that those conversations do have an impact - especially when they're sustained over a longer period of time.

**Comment 3:**
*Original Comment:*
>How are you going to “fix” nich road?

*Reply by Emma Curtis:*
>I'm not going to pretend that I alone can fix Nicholasville Road in one 2-year term as a District Councilmember. But I'll tell you what I think is feasible in the short term and, if I'm lucky enough to be elected, where I'll start:  


1. We need to expand on the existing Complete Streets action plan to include funding to improve our pedestrian infrastructure and implement multimodal intersection design along the Nic Rd. corridor. This is very doable and something that should have happened already, but our current councilmember didn't push for it.  
  
2. In 2025, Council will be hearing proposals from the KY Dept. of Transportation on how to improve traffic flow on Nic Rd. as part of Imagine Nicholasville Road. One of the options will almost certainly be ""do nothing,"" which is unacceptable. We don't know what these proposals will be, but I'm going to push for increased communication between LFUCG and the DOT on this specific issue and advocate for significant investment.

3. Since Nicholasville Rd. is a state road, major changes are going to require partnerships between the local, state, and (potentially) federal governments. I've spent a significant amount of time working with our state legislature and have pre-existing relationships with the State Reps and Senators from both parties who overlap with the 4th District. I fully intend on leveraging those relationships to ensure that our different branches of government are working together on this, rather than stepping on each other's toes.

  
We aren't going to fix it all in 2 years, but we have to start somewhere and we have to have the political courage to actually try.

**Comment 4:**
*Original Comment:*
>> lively discussion about my race    
     
Had to take a pause and re-read that! As for the real question: What should the role of the local government be in getting developers to focus on infilling empty areas of the city with higher density housing as opposed to trying to repeatedly expand the urban boundary?

*Reply by Emma Curtis:*
>Heard! I probably could've worded that sentence a little bit differently, seems like my phrasing may have confused a couple of folks haha

First off, I wouldn't have voted for expansion if I were on the Council last year. But it's too late to stop it, so I'm going to do everything I can to make sure that it's implemented in as intentional and equitable a way as is possible while also making sure that we don't lose sight of the need for infill and redevelopment projects so we don't wind up wasting taxpayer dollars on another band-aid solution years down the line.

To get developers onboard with infill and redevelopment, I think we need to start with reevaluating the costly and convoluted exaction fee system put in place on much of the land acquired in the 1996 expansion. I also support the creation of additional incentives for developers to repurpose underutilized commercial and industrial buildings into mixed-use housing.

I think it's too convoluted to get into on a reddit forum, but I do also think that we need an even more thorough overhaul of our zoning ordinances and land use guidelines.

**Comment 5:**
*Original Comment:*
>Best wishes, but isn't NIcholasville Road a state highway?

*Reply by Emma Curtis:*
>It is, but that doesn't mean that LFUCG has no ability to impact change along the corridor. Any changes the state makes have to be made in collaboration with the local government, and vice versa.

I've spent a significant amount of time working with the legislators in Frankfort from both parties whose districts overlap with the 4th District on a whole myriad of issues, and this would honestly be less controversial than most of them.

We need elected officials in each branch who understand that elected officials at the local, state, and federal levels need to work together to best represent the interests of their shared constituents.

>How many times have you been nearly maimed in your district by someone running a red light?

*Reply by Emma Curtis:*
>I couldn't put a number on it, but it's happened a few times. It's definitely happened more since I've been going door-to-door canvassing this year.

**Comment 9:**
*Original Comment:*
>Hi Emma! I voted for you in the primary earlier this year and was very pleasantly surprised to see you back in the race. I noticed that your recent push has been supported by the group Protect Lex. They don't have much information online, so I was wondering if you could tell me more about them? For example, what are their policy goals, and how do they fit with your candidacy? Thanks and good luck in November!

*Reply by Emma Curtis:*
>Thank you so much for your support!

I've seen some of the Protect Lex ads on social media, but I've never had any conversations with anybody from that organization. Anything they put out there would be an independent expenditure, neither I nor anybody involved with my campaign has any say in it.  
  
My understanding is that they're a PAC that's focused on land use, so my best guess is that they're supporting me in this race because I've said multiple times that I would've voted against the USB expansion if I had been on Council at the time.

**Comment 10:**
*Original Comment:*
>Have you ever sexually assaulted a coworker? Have you ever been *accused* of sexually assaulting a coworker? Or have you ever refused to leave an AT&T store? Or falsified paychecks in the name of your employee to embezzle from the hotel you manage?

*Reply by Emma Curtis:*
>1. I have never sexually assaulted a coworker.  
2. I have never been accused of sexually assaulting a coworker.  
3. I have never refused to leave an AT&T store.  
4. I have never falsified paychecks in the name of an employee, nor have I ever managed a hotel to begin with.

In all seriousness though, this type of behavior from elected officials is a major part of why so many folks are apathetic and don't want to engage with the political process.

We can do better.

>What's your favorite thing about Lexington?

*Reply by Emma Curtis:*
>I love that Lexington manages to feel like both a city and a small town simultaneously. There's always something to do, somewhere to go, and the culture of a city. But we also have the ""front porch culture"" of a small town, where you can't go anywhere without running into somebody you know.

As a talker and an extrovert, it's the best of both worlds for me!

**Comment 12:**
*Original Comment:*
>Hi,
I'm a district 4 resident and I'm a bit concerned about voting for either candidate.  I don't know much about your history, but from what I've read, you're a 28 year old independent film producer, with wealthy parents.  I'm interested to know what experience you have that qualifies you for this position.  Would it be unfair of me to ask what your employment history has been, since graduation?  I don't see any mention of employment on your campaign site.  I just want to make sure this would not be the first time you've been working a structured 40 hours for at least two years.

Now, on the other hand, your opponent can't go to her office because of sexual assault allegations.  Please, convince me to not write in Mike Oxmells or Phil McCraken.

*Reply by Emma Curtis:*
>Sure!

First off, I do want to clarify that my parents weren't wealthy. We were very much working class. After my father died when I was 18 months old, my mom was left with a mountain of medical debt that she spent most of my life working her butt off to pay back.

As for employment, most recently I directed a documentary called There Is No Answer, which is about a local artist named George Szekely that will be airing on KET starting November 4, and worked as a Voter Engagement Organizer with Kentuckians for the Commonwealth up through the 2023 election (you can't hold that job while running for office yourself). Prior to that, I worked for the University of Kentucky International Center and when I was younger, I worked at Amazon, Target, and Old Navy.

I've been doing community organizing and lobbying since 2016 and have been blessed to learn the inner workings of state and local government as a result. Most frequently, I've worked with the ACLU of KY, KFTC, and the Fairness Campaign.

I think that my experience in government, as well as my lived experience as a young working class person in District 4, is what makes me most qualified to serve in this position.

There's more on background under the ""Meet Emma"" page on my website, which I'll link here: [https://emmaforlex.com/meet-emma](https://emmaforlex.com/meet-emma)

Happy to answer any more specific questions you have!

**Comment 14:**
*Original Comment:*
>Does ""fixing"" Nicholasville Rd involve traffic enforcement? Our current councilperson claims that our police shortage makes traffic enforcement impossible and claims that she's the only one who can fix it. Is there anything stopping you from working with our police force?

*Reply by Emma Curtis:*
>I do think traffic enforcement has a role to play here and I'd like to see our police department shift resources towards it.

I don't believe for a second that traffic enforcement is impossible, nor that my opponent is the only one who can fix anything.

I fully intend to work with LPD on this issue and others. I've actually called for expanding the successful programs we have within LPD - especially our community paramedicine program.  
  
Where my opponent and I differ is on the specifics of what police funding should go to. From everything she's said on the matter, she's focused solely on increasing funding for the police department without any oversight or follow-up on the specifics of what that funding is going towards.  
  
I don't think we're going to solve all of our public safety issues by just throwing money at the police department, we have to actually be intentional about the specific programs we're funding.

*Reply by Emma Curtis:*
>Well, for one, I think our Councilmembers and our School Board Members need to actually be in contact with each other.

I was lucky to attend a local candidates forum last night, where I was able to speak with several Board Members and candidates about exactly this.  
  
Clearly communication is a problem here, so I made sure to exchange cell numbers with each of them that I could. If the traditional channels fail, I think it's on the individual CMs and Board Members to be in communication and actually collaborate to address whatever issue is in question at the moment.

>Good luck. How do you intend to fix Nicholasville Road? That'll take you 19 terms on the council to even get close to doing but I'd like to know you're playing for it.

>I spoke in an earlier response about specifics of what I'd like to get done in the short term, so I'll tell you what my overall philosophy on this is here:

Think big. Start small. Move fast.

(And, for what it's worth, I support term limits in all legislative bodies from the local to the federal. The thought of anybody serving 19 terms on Council is horrifying to me.)

**Comment 17:**
*Original Comment:*
>Are you from Lexington or Kentucky?

*Reply by Emma Curtis:*
>Yes! I was born in Lexington and spent my earliest years living here with my parents and my grandparents while my father underwent treatment for lung cancer and for a while longer after his passing.

I mostly grew up on my family's farm on Old Frankfort Pike in Woodford County, which we sold when I was a teenager. Then I lived about 6 minutes from the Fayette County line, near the KY Castle until I graduated from high school.

I spent 4 years studying at Centre and then have been in District 4 since shortly after graduating.

For a long time, I bought into the narrative that I'd have to move somewhere else because I'm trans, because I work as a filmmaker, or because I'm politically left-of-center. But over time, I've learned that those narratives are bogus.

We are so much more here than we've been told we have to be.

**Comment 19:**
*Original Comment:*
>You’ve been very vocal about your opponent’s sexual assault of another councilperson and of your support for survivors. Yet it seems like you have not actually reached out to check on or offer support to the actual victim, while also using her assault as campaign fodder (per her own post).

Can you clarify what actual support you are currently offering those of us who are survivors, or would offer if elected?

*Reply by Emma Curtis:*
>I haven't personally reached out to CM Gray because I haven't wanted to give any credence to my opponent's claims that CM Gray was politically motivated in seeking a protective order or that her doing so has anything whatsoever to do with this election.

I believe her and I hate that the details of what she's experienced have been made public. Nobody should have to relive such traumatic moments in the public eye in order to get some semblance of justice or safety in the workplace.

As an individual, what I've tried to do is to speak up about my own experience with sexual harassment, make it clear that I believe survivors, and ensure that there are concrete measures in place to hold those who sexually harass and assault other people accountable for the actions and keep their survivors safe.

If elected, I'll continue to do the same. I hope to serve on the Domestic and Sexual Violence Prevention Coalition and work with community partners like Greenhouse17 to make sure we are providing them with the resources they need to keep survivors safe.

I’m super into gaming, and it would be great to make some new friends to play with. My main console is PS5, but I’ve got others as well. My library is big, so I’m sure we can find something to play! 

Other than that I enjoy reading/listening to audiobooks, watching series and cartoons, sports, DnD, music and so on. I’m also trying to go to the gym regularly. 

I’m generally a chill person who’s easy to get along with. So if any of this sounds interesting to you, don’t hesitate to shoot me a message! 

I would prefer to talk to people around my own age, or at least 21+. And I’m only looking for platonic friends. ",2,1729770027.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False

**Feeling uninspired? Procrastinating like a panda on a treadmill? Fear not, fellow wordsmith! Let's outsmart this block with ninja tactics:**

**Environment Hacks:**

* **Shower Epiphany:** Write steamy scenes (figuratively, please) in the shower. Guaranteed inspiration (or at least clean ideas).
* **Nature Nudge:** Write under a tree, feeling the breeze whisper secrets (or scold you for slacking).
* **Coffee Catastrophe:** Spill coffee on your manuscript? Panic, then laugh, then write about it. Bonus points for caffeine-fueled creativity.

**Spark Your Inner Weirdo:**

* **Automatic Writing:** Set a timer, close your eyes, and let your subconscious scribble. Prepare for hilarious nonsense or hidden gems.
* **Cut-Up Chaos:** Chop up quotes, headlines, or song lyrics, then Frankenstein them into a bizarre story.
* **Dream Diary Delusion:** Record your dreams, even the nonsensical ones. They're like free story prompts from your subconscious.
* **Random Object Roulette:** Spin a pen, point at your bookshelf, write a story about the book it lands on. Embrace the chaos!

**Challenge Your Inner Critic (Shut it Up):**

* **Write the Worst:** Write the absolute worst scene imaginable. You'll be so embarrassed, you'll write something good to redeem yourself.
* **Cliché Challenge:** Write a scene using every writing cliché in the book. Then rewrite it, destroying clichés with your brilliance.
* **Mirror, Mirror:** Stare into the mirror and have a deep conversation with your reflection about your story. Bonus points for dramatic monologues.
* **Future You Fury:** Imagine your future self, successful and published, berating you for procrastinating. Write a scene about their disappointment.

**Bonus Tip:** Reward yourself with something ridiculous for every completed scene. Like a dance party to the Macarena or wearing a lampshade as a hat. Embrace the absurdity!

Remember, writer's block is just a temporary hurdle. With a little wit and these offbeat techniques, you'll be back to churning out words like a caffeinated squirrel on a sugar rush.

1gb03bj,https://www.reddit.com/r/AdultADHDSupportGroup/comments/1gb03bj/does_it_sound_like_i_have_inattentive_adhd/,Does it sound like I have inattentive ADHD?,"26M here. Two weeks ago, I began my second attempt at quitting caffeine cold turkey after \~11 years of daily consumption ranging from 100 to 400 mg. My first attempt at quitting last year went [terribly bad](https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/158mw0l/i_cant_believe_the_depression_im_going_through/). Basically, I couldn't function and had to resume caffeine intake after two months.

I now suspect that I may have inattentive ADHD and have been unwittingly self-medicating with caffeine since my teenage years. During my late teens, I consumed a significant amount of coffee—upwards of 400 mg daily—but gradually tapered off over time.

Here's how I feel when I'm off caffeine:

* Jaded and lethargic.
* Near-zero motivation to engage in tasks that require sustained focus and mental effort, affecting both work and personal activities.
* While I can still work, it feels dreadful, and I'm less productive than before. I no longer enjoy my work.
* My long-term ambitions seem to have vanished.
* Making money doesn't give me much satisfaction.

By contrast, when I'm consuming caffeine, I'm cheerful and goal-oriented. I rarely feel down, look forward to the future in all areas of life, and have no trouble busting out long days of work.

Additional relevant information:

* Modafinil works wonders for me; even without caffeine, it enables me to operate at full capacity.
* Natural nootropics like Lion's Mane and Bacopa Monnieri have little effect when I'm off stimulants, although I notice slight improvements when using them alongside caffeine.
* Depression seems unlikely, as I'm sleeping well (8–9 hours per night), eating a healthy diet rich in vegetables and protein, and exercising 5–6 days a week.
* I have a relatively demanding job as the CEO of a VC-backed tech startup. It's possible that I don't have inattentive ADHD but that the nature of my job requires a stimulant.
* Still, occupational burnout also seems unlikely. The contrast between my caffeinated and decaffeinated states is stark. I love my job when I'm on a stimulant, but when off, any mentally demanding task feels daunting—not just work.

5’7” SW156 CW150

Very active, early 30’s Female. work on my feet and run 5k 3-4 times a week as well. I eat anywhere from 1300-1700 depending on the day. Been counting calories for about 1.5 months after realizing I was getting uncomfortably close to overweight on BMI scale. 

I’m taking 2 tbsp Psyllium Fiber daily, 1tbsp at a time in the morning and afternoon. I also take magnesium and I drink coffee in the morning. Most days I hit my fiber goal with foods I eat and the fiber supplement. 

For the past couple weeks I just can not get a satisfying poo, like it feels like it’s not all out i guess but I don’t have to “go” more. Yesterday for example I had my fiber, I had a cup of oatmeal, and my poo this morning was not satisfying, it was also not formed and probably a 2 on the Bristol scale. 

It feels like my weight is stalled and partially because of poo weight. I am ok with the scale not going down super quickly like it did at first… I can see changes in body composition. I also realize I don’t have a ton of weight to lose, I would be happy at 135 or 140. But it’s frustrating to feel like my body is “holding on” to food or something. 

This also is all complicated by my cycle, which I track diligently. I’m currently in the beginning of luteal phase which I know can be tough. But my follicular phase this month wasn’t much better in the poo department.

The espresso was always between acidic and bitter.

I tried earlier, and what if my water was not hot enough ?

I was already doing blank shot before pulling the espresso.

I put a bowl under the machine, i'm at 60° for the first short (the blank one) and 64° the second one, and 68° the third one.

Even after booting up the machine and waiting for 10min, it's 65°

I read everywhere, the water should be around 80-90°

Is my machine busted ? she is like 3 years old.

I have been trying to install Ventura for a couple of days now with very limited results. No matter what I do I seem to get #\[EB|LOG:EXITBS:START\] errors. Please see the attached log: [Log](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XB2eH2zcbQTjo0gkpMWN9ZvUn5_xdN3V/view?usp=sharing) and [config.plist](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16F_4qNQvK804q3HTEUtqKZZX8gT7EneL/view?usp=sharing)

What I have done so far:

1. Created the USB-installer as per Dortania guide. Tried with Ventura first and then Monterey.
2. Created my own aml files with SSDT-Time as per guide.
3. Mapped the USB ports with USBToolBox.
4. Gathered the .kext files and made sure to download the newest ones.
5. Closely followed the guide for Comet Lake as I believe that is for this laptop and CPU model. [https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/config-laptop.plist/coffee-lake-plus.html](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/config-laptop.plist/coffee-lake-plus.html)
6. Used sample.config as base and edited the plist with the help of the guide.

I cannot seem to get the installer to load no matter what I do. When ever I look at the log I have the same error. I have tried all the quirks and edits from this guide [Troubleshoot](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/troubleshooting/extended/kernel-issues.html#stuck-on-eb-log-exitbs-start) but nothing seems to work.

Does anyone with this laptop have any tips in order to get Monterey/Ventura installed?

Then I take my BP which is 120/70. I then drink two cups of coffee, have breakfast, shower, etc and get ready for my work day. I work from home sitting on a computer from 8am to 5pm.

Periodically check my BP late morning or afternoon, and it’s 138/90. 

Also every time I go the the doctor office it’s 138/90. Problem is it takes me like 25 mins for it to come down and he don’t wait that long. Even still it will only come down to 132/88 after resting while in dr office. 

I take 10mg Lisinopril. 

Doc doesn’t like that my BP is that high during the day and wants to up my daily mg of Lisinopril. I get very nervous at doctors because of a childhood kidney failure/trauma that happened. 

Is the 138/90 bad all day when its 120/70 in the morning 30 mins after waking up?

>History teaches us that religion, while in one regard seeking happiness for people, has all too often been a source of division and conflict.

Yesterday Dee and I were speaking about this point with Xi who lives across the pond. Look at the agenda of some religionists in the United States (Example: [Fighting demons: The New Apostolic Reformation is waging a holy war against democracy](https://www.salon.com/2024/10/20/fighting-demons-the-new-apostolic-reformation-is-waging-a-holy-against-democracy/)). And the horror at what [just occurred](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/259953/islamic-terrorists-massacre-150-in-burkina-faso) in Burkina Faso--which barely registered on the Richter scale of news😢🥺🥵😡🤨! Or, look at [the bizarreness](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/259557/china-is-removing-crosses-from-churches-replacing-images-of-christ-with-xi-jinping-per-uscirf-report) of anti-religionism in China.

Sensei continues:

>The Lotus Sutra embodies a wisdom that transcends the duality of good and evil and regards both good and evil as potentials within all human beings. These potentials lie dormant or emerge depending upon external causes and conditions. It holds that it is possible to activate the good and teaches the principles for doing that.

“These potentials lie dormant or emerge depending upon external causes and conditions.” That's our side of the equation, Ladies!!! According to the philosophy of the Lotus Sutra, every day we can create those external causes and conditions.

I see this first hand everyday as Dee corresponds with her friends to build “bridges toward peace.” Xi is doing this as well. In her Masters thesis she is imagining the role the countries in Central and Eastern Europe can play in buffering [The Clash of Civilizations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clash_of_Civilizations?wprov=sfla1) between Russia and the West. She also looks at Pope Francis’ body of work to find a trail to peace (See [1](https://www.americamagazine.org/faith/2024/09/25/pope-francis-all-religions-paths-248873), [2](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/259875/dutch-cardinal-advocates-christ-centered-reform-over-controversial-issues
)).

Can efforts such as these make a difference? Xi believes they absolutely do, but you have to look far and wide to see them. She quoted the Gosho:

>Listen with the ears of Shih K'uang and observe with the eyes of Li Lou. In the Latter Day of the Law, the votary of the Lotus Sutra will appear without fail. The greater the hardships befalling him, the greater the delight he feels, because of his strong faith (WND-1, p. 33).

Dee was telling Xi about 
[A Tacit Peace Proposal from the Kremlin?](https://www.kyivpost.com/opinion/40787). And the slightest glimmer of hope in the Israel/Palestine conflict (see [here](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/al-qaeda-adviser-calls-for-hamas-to-free-hostages-says-attention-overshadowing-fate-of-palestinian-prisoners/?utm_source=flipboard&utm_content=other
)). Xi was relating the slightest shifts of the wind in the thinking of orthodoxy (see [here](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/259551/theologian-participating-in-synod-on-synodality-heralds-heterodox-views)).

They both agreed that we have to keep burning the flame of conviction that peace is possible despite all of the challenging winds. Human beings have ultimately created agonizing situations; human beings have the capacity to solve them!

Sensei next revisits his lecture at Italy’s University of Palermo in 2007: 

>I believe that the true value of creative, constructive dialogue is to be found in our effort to perfect and elevate our own lives, to suppress the manifestation of evil or negative aspects and to foster and encourage the manifestation of good or positive aspects. 

Dee and Xi agreed that this is exactly what we must accomplish in the micro environments of our lives and communities. Let me paraphrase from [Some Enchanted Evening](https://youtu.be/E5dPtkVCRsg?si=509Guoid5KClvBZr): “Once you have found it, never let it go.”

And on that note, a big shout out to Mitzi Gaynor who [passed away](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/oct/20/mitzi-gaynor-obituary) this week at the age of 93.

Sensei concludes the section:

>This very effort underlies the kind of dialogue and communication that we are in such dire need of today.

Xi personifies that spirit. Every morning she deepens her friendships with her close friends over swimming and coffee. She works the  lunch shift at Heinz's restaurant and loves her brief encounters as the greeter with people from all around the world. She talks so glowingly of the learning environment at Central European University which, just like her thesis, probes the blending of Western, Central, and Eastern Europe cultures. She returns home and treasures her time with her dad Steve and Lady Greta who share in the raising of Jürgen-Franz. “Living such a beautiful life is like a platform for me. How can I not want such a life for everyone?”

*Oh, why not?* It's so insignificant in comparison to everything above. But we [just learned](https://wyrk.com/bills-offers-leave-wny/) a local example of “to suppress the manifestation of evil or negative aspects and to foster and encourage the manifestation of good or positive aspects.” It seems that several metropolitan areas with larger markets were attempting to lure our beloved Buffalo Bills to their cities. Completely behind the scenes, Governor Hochul put together and pushed through a deal that keeps them in Western New York and gives us a new stadium to boot.

All of my children  have mental health issues to some degree due to years of mental abuse from their father. 64m my partner treats the kids well for the most part but has zero patience with my responsibilities for them. I'm hiding things I do with them (like extra rides or a quick stop at coffee shop). I'm not doing right by them and meeting their teen needs because I'm afraid of his reaction. I feel like something is wrong. I can't figure out if it is trauma response from wanting to avoid anger at any cost. I feel he has the right to be irritated by all the responsibilities of raising teens and we only have one vehicle. I just don't know how to male hum understand they need the doctor appointment, the counselling, the job searching, the rides to work and school for stuff and friends. I'm sure he is over child rearing but he was divorced during his kids teen years and he entered this relationship fully aware of my situation which I'm sure he underestimated the toughness of it. His grouchiness and ""old man anger"" has caused my kids not to want to get in a vehicle with him particularly my 17 year old autistic son (very smart seems normal but has quirks and mental health issues has been suicidal off and on during crisis for two years). So I also have to skirt around that. My life is a ball of fk'n stress. Any older men with younger partners want to chime in here? I want to respect his needs at 64 to do what he wants whenever he wants and am happy to work to get there but he reverts into defeat if anything is scheduled and won't start an activity after 2 or 3 in afternoon.  I'm afraid because I have ptsd and have been in mentally abusive controlling relationship that I might not be responding well to his frustrations. Also...I kind of fear his temperment change has an early dementia feel to it (runs in his family) ...there are definitely signs but I don't want that to be an excuse for behaviours that effects the kids.

1gazm2j,https://www.reddit.com/r/freelanceWriters/comments/1gazm2j/my_journey_as_a_writer_from_1100w_to_13100w_and/,My journey as a writer from $1/100w to $13/100w and $11k per month,"A lot of freelance writers who are just starting out seem to have a lot of questions about where to find work, how to charge, etc. so I thought I will make a quick history of my own work and how I found higher-paying work, increased my charge steadily, and specialized in a particular niche after a point. I've been writing since 2014.

At first, I started checking out content writing service sellers on a forum called BlackHatWorld. I contacted those sellers telling them that I am a writer, do you have space on your team? If yes, I can write for you.

Then they will ask for your writing work or ask you to do a sample. If they like your quality, some of them will take you (not all have space on their team). I hustled that way, getting 1 person to respond out of 20-30 outreaches.

Anyway, I did that around 2014-15 and I wrote a lot of content for these guys at dirt cheap rate, sometimes even under $1 per 100 words. That is how you grow, learn the ropes, improve your quality. I am still growing after 10 years.

In around 2019 I saw I was getting a lot of orders in a particular niche, so I decided to specialize in that niche. I asked my clients (who were sellers, not direct clients) to give me more orders in that niche, and I worked hard to improve my knowledge and quality for that niche specifically.

Fast forward to 2022-23 and I pitched companies in this niche directly that I am a writer who specializes in your niche/industry, here are may samples (I selected the very best work I did).

At that point any company/website that had a writing requirement could not say no to me, my work was just so spot-on and high-quality.

Currently, I am writing at $13/100w (to be more precise, £0.1/word). I am writing roughly 4-5k words a day \* 5 days a week, so roughly £9,000 or $11,670 per month.

I write for the biggest websites in the niche and am a published author on multipe platforms. Some of my clients are on a monthly contract with me, giving 20-25k words a month, while others are on a freelance basis.

I have written in virtually every niche over the last 10 years, ranging from blockchain and video games to health, legal, finance, lifestyle, entertainment, travel, and what's the best bed for dogs.

Tips:

* If you are just starting out in website content writing or writing articles, your quality is most likely poor. Only practice can help you grow.
* Read more than you write. This includes books. Remember them?
* It's less about the writing speed or writing with perfect grammar and more about doing your research. You have to be as close to an expert in the domain you are writing about as possible.
* I might have been slow to reach here, but I'd say if you're not willing to give it at least 2-4 years of just practice, you will not find **stable** work as a content writing freelancer.
* The idea is to make contacts. Find people who are already selling content writing services and start from there.
* The range of your vocabulary grows the more you read. The wider this range, the better you'll write.
* As a beginner, you're highly recommended to use Grammarly.
* Format your articles properly. No unnecessary line breaks, double spaces, bad punctuation.
* Fluff, filler, and writing in bad style (not thinking from the POV of the reader) are basic problems. Unfortunately, it's hard to distinguish bad writing from good and no-nonsense copy if you're just beginning. But try to be conscious of your sentences and paragraphs. Do they add actual value if you were a reader? If yes, good. If no, delete that stuff and do more research.
* Get a good mechanical keyboard when your workload begins to increase. Membrane keyboards are not for writers, your fingers will hurt when you begin to type at 100 WPM for hours. Invest in an ergonomic chair and a proper PC setup with a large monitor too.
* AI has destroyed many careers. Some clients just use AI directly, others want non-AI content so they use grossly incompetent AI detectors which force you to rewrite repeatedly. Sadly, there's no way out. You need to work hard and carve a niche for yourself so you have a reputation. This will likely take years.
* Read your articles before you submit. It's not just for finding mistakes but sometimes, when you're in the flow, you're prone to making awkward slip-ups that your clients won't like.
* If you have an order of 20 articles, it makes sense to write them in batches of 5, proofread and review them, then move on to the next batch.
* Use a to-do list or tracker app of some kind. The human mind needs visual verification of work being done. When you see you are ticking off items in your list, only then will your brain release sufficient dopamine. A consistently higher level of dopamine is required for any kind of computer-based job as it keeps your motivation up and procrastination away (helps do that, at least).
* Personal preference: Replace coffee with a caffeine + L-theanine supplement and see your productivity and focus shoot through the roof.

Of course, no journey is so simple. I just wanted to compress it all and only mention the highlights. If you have any specific questions, I am all ears. And please don't judge the quality of my writing with this post, this was written in 10 minutes with no proofreading.

BUT, since Turkish coffee is served in **larger portions**, you're typically getting **more caffeine** in one serving.

**Why does this matter?** 

* **Espresso** gives you a quick, concentrated caffeine hit in a small amount.
* **Turkish coffee** is enjoyed in a **slower, richer brew**, so it lasts longer and delivers more caffeine overall.

**Final Verdict:** If you’re comparing a shot of espresso to a cup of Turkish coffee, **Turkish coffee usually has more caffeine**.

To sum it up, the CPALE was cancelled nationwide today, and my partner was supposed to take it. I was with him throughout the entire review season, sitting beside him for hours in coffee shops and staying by his side, even though I often felt alone. Everything seemed fine, until my birthday came, and I ended up spending it by myself. I understood, and at the time, it didn’t feel like a big deal.

But now, I’ve started to realize that I don't really feel like I'm a part of his life anymore. He doesn't seem to care as much, and while I know preparing for the board exam can make someone more self-focused, this time it feels like I'm completely left out of his world.

There are also moments when I feel unheard, and the only time he seems to pay attention to me is when he's angry. And when he's mad, he gets *really* mad. I've heard him say things like, ""You don’t understand me at all,"" or ""You don't understand how hard it is for me."" even though I’ve spent so much time trying to understand him, often putting my own needs aside, even when I needed him the most.

Lately, it doesn’t even feel like he wants to meet up or that he misses me. Even the smallest gesture, like sending a message, seems difficult for him, and there are times when he’s not even studying but still takes hours to reply.

I feel conflicted, like it's selfish to feel lonely in this relationship, and that’s why I don’t know how to process this. Before all these feelings surfaced, I was deeply in love with him, but lately, something just feels off.

As the title says. I have been running 3 weeks of google ads, a brand new campaign on a website that is also relatively new. We are an e-commerce store selling homeware and furniture. 

We had been creating organic social media content before for about 6-9 months and running some social media ads to test the water, this created a few conversions and some website traffic but it was only soft test to workout website kinks before we took the plunge and invested into google ads. 

The first 3 weeks of ads has yielded 934 clicks, 77.1k impressions, £0.58 cpc, 1.23% CTR. We have made 2 sales grossing £318.99 and we've spent £550, so in the hole slightly but hoping for some more conversions this week as it's payday week here in the UK. 

We are running a max clicks, Shopping campaign targeting our lamps and a chair that we sell. Our bids are set to a £2.50 max. We had no max set for the first week and the ad was spending anywhere up to £8 for a click and we averaged out at around £5 after that first week. At this time the ad favoured the lamps, I then created ad groups separating floor lamps, table lamps and the chair so we could get some more targeted search terms. The ad continued to push the lamps for another week or so, then it suddenly switched to the chair and really started to push it. We made a chair sale and another sale of an item not in the ad (coffee cups).

I feel like we have a strong website, strong landing page, I feel like our prices are higher than some other sites but cheaper than many others also. We have a relatively unique selection of products and we update and maintain our products monthly/seasonally. Our conversion tracking is set up but no sales have come directly through the ad, although I think one of the sales did come from an old click but they they came directly to the site on another day to make the purchase. Other conversion trackers are working, page views, added to cart etc. 

We see repeat visitors using the website multiple times, 1185 visitors and 1367 sessions over the time period running the ad. We have an average session duration of 1 minute and 2 seconds, however this is skewed due to customers that bounce and spend no time on the site. We often see on days where there is a lot of traffic that the average session duration can range from 1-2.5 minutes. 

We also have pop-ups with a sign-up offer of 20% (usually 10%) off your first order, this is helping us capture customer info. We are running the 20% off promotion until the end of this month then it will go back to 10%. We also offer free shipping worldwide on orders over £150. 

I can provide any more information that might help.

1gaza9q,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthTrendz/comments/1gaza9q/my_oatzempic_diet_review_does_oatzempic_diet/,My Oatzempic diet review. Does Oatzempic diet challenge work for weight loss?,"

If you spend time on TikTok or keep up with the latest diet trends you might have come across the Oatzempic diet. It has been a buzzing topic of late.

It’s a play on the popular weight-loss medication **Ozempic**. Instead of a pharmaceutical solution, **Oatzempic** is all about using oats, lime juice and water to create a drink that some users claim helps with weight loss.

Okay so **before you rush to the kitchen**, let me review this diet and assess a bit more about this “potential magic solution”.

## What is the Oatzempic Diet?

The **Oatzempic diet** is essentially a meal replacement drink. Here’s how you go about it..

- It combines **3 basic ingredients**: ½ cup of rolled oats, 1 cup of water, and juice from half a lime.
- Some people add **cinnamon** or fruit like **bananas** for extra flavor.
- The recipe is **simple** and uses ingredients that most people already have at home.
- It is an **accessible option** for anyone looking to try it.

So why all the hype? TikTok users are claiming that this concoction helps them lose weight by **reducing hunger** and making them feel fuller for longer. The idea is that the **fiber** in the oats slows down digestion, helping you stay satisfied while consuming fewer calories.

Oatzempic is liked because it’s a **low-calorie option** that helps with fullness while maintaining a **caloric deficit**.

**Note:** All in all, it’s a decent approach, but if we’re using fiber options to act like Ozempic, I’d rather go with options like **PhenQ, Hourglass Fit, and the Smoothie Diet**. I'd recommend the [**Smoothie Diet**](http://links.cambridgewellbeing.org/out/smoothiediet.php) specifically over the Oatzempic diet.

While the Oatzempic diet relies on oats and lime for fiber and fullness, it lacks the balance of essential nutrients and can become monotonous. [**PhenQ**](http://links.cambridgewellbeing.org/out/phenq2.php) **(multi-ingredient supplement) and** [**Hourglass Fit**](http://links.cambridgewellbeing.org/out/hourglassfit.php) **(glucomannan based fat burner)** offer supplements that target fat loss, appetite control, and energy boosts in a more sustainable and convenient way.

Plus, the [**Smoothie Diet**](http://links.cambridgewellbeing.org/out/smoothiediet.php) is packed with varied, nutrient-rich recipes that not only aid weight loss but also promote overall health, giving you more energy and preventing cravings. These options just feel more practical and enjoyable for long-term success compared to a restrictive drink like Oatzempic.

## The Science Behind Oatzempic

When it comes to understanding why the **Oatzempic diet** might work?

It all comes down to the **science of oats**. Oats are packed with **beta-glucan**, a type of **soluble fiber** that helps slow down digestion. This, in turn, can lead to feeling fuller for longer, which is why oats are often touted as a great food for weight management.

- **Beta-glucan** in oats turns into a gel-like substance in your gut. This **slows nutrient absorption** and helps to keep **blood sugar levels stable**.
- Stable blood sugar levels prevent **mid-morning crashes** that make you reach for snacks.
- Keep in mind**, Oats alone** won’t cause rapid weight loss—they’re just one part of the solution.
- Don’t expect a fortnight miracle—Oatzempic isn’t a magic pill for weight loss. The key to success is **consistency** and fitting Oatzempic into a **balanced, sustainable approach** to weight management.
- **Oats are healthy and filling**, making them a helpful part of a weight loss plan, especially when replacing high-calorie breakfasts.
- **Unlike Ozempic**, which alters hormonal signals to control hunger, **Oatzempic** **works purely through fiber.**

## Does Oatzempic Work for Weight Loss?

### **Caloric Deficit Theory : how it might help?**

If you’re familiar with weight loss, you’ve probably heard of **CICO** (Calories In, Calories Out). The idea is simple: if you eat fewer calories than you burn, you’ll lose weight. **Oatzempic** fits into this because it’s a **low-calorie** option that can help you reduce your overall intake.

Replacing a high-calorie breakfast with this oat drink could help you stay in a caloric deficit, which is the foundation for weight loss. However, the drink alone isn’t going to do the heavy lifting—you still need to **manage your overall calorie intake**.

### **Potential Benefits**

By swapping your usual breakfast (think bagels, cereal, or sugary coffee) with **Oatzempic**, you could cut hundreds of calories out of your daily diet. Since oats are high in fiber, they can help keep you full for longer and prevent mid-morning snacking. Maintaining a calorie deficit along with this drink might give you the edge to shed a few pounds..

### **Expert Opinions**

Many nutritionists agree that while **Oatzempic** might help with weight loss, it’s not a magic bullet.

Experts like registered dietitian [**Caroline Thomason**](https://www.foodnetwork.com/healthyeats/news/does-oatzempic-tiktok-work) caution that relying on meal replacements like Oatzempic isn’t sustainable in the long run. She stresses that **balanced, long-term eating habits** are the key to keeping weight off, rather than quick-fix trends.

## Intermittent Fasting & Oatzempic

### **How Intermittent Fasting is tied to Oatzempic ?**

If you’ve seen the **Oatzempic challenge** on TikTok, you’ve likely noticed that many people combine it with **intermittent fasting**. This is because **time-restricted eating** can reduce the number of calories you consume in a day, just like CICO.

Oatzempic becomes the ""first meal"" after a 16-hour fast, and because it’s low in calories and high in fiber, it helps people stay full until their next meal.

### **Benefits of Time-Restricted Eating**

**Intermittent fasting** isn’t just about skipping meals—it can change how your body uses energy. By fasting for long periods, your body switches to burning fat for fuel, which can boost weight loss. Adding **Oatzempic** as your first meal after fasting can help control hunger and prevent you from overeating later in the day.

Btw, Appetite suppressants like PhenQ, HourGlass Fit that I’ve mentioned above, also help in intermittent fasting.

## Risks and Downsides of the Oatzempic Diet

### **Unsustainable for Long-Term Weight Loss**

When considering, to use **Oatzempic** as a meal replacement, you should know that these kinds of diets are rarely sustainable in the long run. While replacing a meal with a low-calorie drink can help you cut calories initially, over time, most people find it hard to stick to such limited choices. **Long-term weight loss** requires more than just quick fixes—it's about adopting habits that you can maintain over time.

### **Potential Nutritional Deficiencies**

Only relying on **Oatzempic** as a regular meal replacement, you might miss out on key nutrients. Oats are great for fiber, but they lack important elements like **protein**, healthy fats, and some vitamins and minerals. Over time, this could lead to **nutritional deficiencies** that can affect your overall health, energy levels, and even your ability to lose weight effectively.

### **Calorie Restriction Risks**

Another major downside of highly **calorie-restrictive diets** is the risk of binging. When you drastically cut calories or restrict your meals too much, your body often reacts by triggering intense cravings. This can lead to **overeating** later in the day, undoing the progress you’ve made. A more **balanced approach** to eating tends to be more effective for sustainable weight loss.

## Social Media Influence on Diet Trends

### **The Role of TikTok in Promoting Diets**

If you spend time on **TikTok**, you’ve probably noticed how fast diet trends like **Oatzempic** go viral. These platforms can quickly amplify ideas that promise **fast results**, even if they’re not backed by science. While TikTok is great for entertainment, it’s not always the best source for **nutrition advice**. Often, creators aren’t dietitians, and their content may be more about gaining followers than providing sound advice.

### **Critical Thinking is necessary**

It’s easy to get caught up in the excitement of a **new diet trend**, but it’s important to **think critically** before jumping in. Ask yourself: Is there real science behind this? Will this diet be **sustainable** for me? Most importantly, does it fit into a **balanced, healthy lifestyle**?

Viral trends can sometimes lead to **unrealistic expectations** and even harmful results, so it’s crucial to approach these ideas with caution. Always research thoroughly, and if in doubt, consult with a **registered dietitian** before making major changes to your diet.

## Alternative Ways to Incorporate Oats for Health

### **Healthier Oatmeal Options**

If you’re looking to make your oatmeal more balanced, consider adding **protein**, **healthy fats**, and **complex carbohydrates**.

- A great example is cooking oats with almond milk, topping it with **nut butter**, chia seeds, and fresh berries.
- You can even mix in **Greek yogurt** or a scoop of **protein powder** for added protein. This combination helps keep you full longer and provides a steady release of energy throughout the day.

### **Overnight Oats or Traditional Oatmeal**

For convenience, you can try **overnight oats**, which you prepare the night before. Mix oats, almond milk, chia seeds, and your favorite fruits in a jar and let it sit in the fridge. By morning, you have a delicious, ready-to-eat breakfast. For a warm option, go with **traditional oatmeal**, and spice it up with cinnamon, nuts, or fruit to keep it interesting and satisfying.

## Is Oatzempic Worth Trying?

Many of the weight loss results, people rave about likely come from the fact that they are replacing a higher-calorie meal with this low-calorie alternative. The oats can provide fiber and help you feel fuller, but long-term weight loss requires more than just a single drink or diet trend. So, you will find that meal replacement trends often lose their appeal quickly.

It’s all about **consistency** and overall habits. For **sustainable weight loss**, focus on a diet rich in **whole foods** like fruits, vegetables, lean protein, and healthy fats.

**Oatzempic** can be a helpful tool if you’re looking to reduce calories. **Oatzempic can be part of the plan**, but don’t forget the importance of a well-rounded diet. Stick to a balanced diet.",2,1729765358.0,HealthTrendz,0,1.0,False
