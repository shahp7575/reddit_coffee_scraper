I‚Äôm looking for someone traveling from **Tbilisi to India (especially Mumbai/Delhi)** who can help bring a few items for me. Since skincare is cheaper in Georgia and I‚Äôd love some local treats, I‚Äôm hoping to get:  
- **4 bottles (400ml ) of La Roche-Posay skincare** (specifics via DM).  
- **2-3 bottles of Georgian wine** (nothing fancy, just good local ones).  
- Optional extras if space allows: **Churchkhela or coffee**.  

### **Important Notes:**  
- **Alcohol cannot be shipped via parcel in India**, so I‚Äôll need you to **hand-carry the wine** to my friend in Mumbai/Delhi. I‚Äôll pick it up from them.  
- All items are **legal and for personal use**‚Äîno heavy luggage needed!  

### **Compensation:**  
- I‚Äôll cover the  cost of items + extra for your effort (DM me your price).

1l7t9o8,https://youtu.be/7UmIPpyjlBQ,Struggled with pre-filling form fields in Elementor Popups? Here‚Äôs how I finally figured it out (so you don‚Äôt have to üòÖ),"Just wanted to share something that had me scratching my head for days while building a site.

I was trying to pre-fill Elementor form fields *inside a popup,* like pulling in the post title, product info, or even user data dynamically. 

Sounds simple, right? But there wasn‚Äôt a straightforward guide anywhere. Everything I found was either outdated or only half-working.

After a lot of trial and error (and a few cups of frustration-coffee), I finally got it working using pre-query parameters, custom code and let me tell you, once you crack it, it opens up a bunch of smart form use cases. 

Super handy for lead capture, booking flows, or even personalized user experiences.

Thought I‚Äôd share the full step-by-step so it might save someone else the struggle.

If you‚Äôve ever wanted to auto-fill form fields in an Elementor popup based on what page/post/product the user clicked from this might help!

Also, I‚Äôve collected a bunch of similar code snippets and little workarounds for Elementor over time. 

So if you‚Äôre stuck on something specific and can‚Äôt find a native way to do it, feel free to ask, happy to share whatever I can. We all know how tricky Elementor can get with custom stuff sometimes üòÑ

I have tried yesterday to identify a hissing sound coming from the boiler, however as I initially thought the sound comes from the steam pipe to boiler connector, I noticed some bubbles of air below the safety valve. 

Image here: https://ibb.co/n8z81PWw

I am not familiar with maintaining the machine, but I also am not scared of disassembling everything. It seems that I need to take off all connections to the boiler, then take off the boiler from the machine and change the copper gasket (00019974) + teflon tape and reattach the safety valve to the boiler. My concern is that I read this safety valve must be verified by a professional to not turn the boiler into a bomb. Is this right or not?

1l7t7dq,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1l7t7dq/i_just_want_to_share_my_story/,I just want to share my story.,"my boyfriend Ben has a history of being a cheater. i knew this going into the relationship. i thought i could change him.

but then in january, i found texts from him trying to set up a date with a girl. i confronted him and he said it wouldnt happen again.

then it happened again, in february. sexting a girl, telling her he wanted to get her pregnant, secretly screen recording a masturbation video she had sent him (she had never given him permission to save or screen record the video and wasn‚Äôt aware that he had done so until i told her. i deleted the video at her request. what he did is considered a crime in our state).

then it happened again, in march. sexting his ex girlfriend Maddie, requesting tit pics, telling her how much he missed eating her ass and pussy and trying to set up a time to meet up again.

by this time, i had become so paranoid that i routinely looked into his phone to see who he was talking to.

Ben doesn‚Äôt believe in therapy and medications, he thinks its all a scam and that all problems can be fixed by coffee and nicotine. he repeatedly encouraged me to come off of my meds, so at this point, in march, i decided to do so AMA.

after i found out about him sexting Maddie, i was so upset that i started messaging guys, and sending nudes. i even tried to meet up with a guy, but backed out at the last minute because i felt so shitty about it. he found out about it and forced me to call all the men i talked to and apologise to them on speaker phone for him to hear. it was humiliating. he eventually forgave me for this, but he said it still lingers in the back of his mind.

then, in april: he was sending sexual messages to a girl named Luna, who had cheated on her boyfriend with Ben (while Ben was cheating on his then girlfriend, Jane). this made me so angry, so enraged that i hacked into his instagram account and started messaging Luna, pretending to be him, in order to get information about her boyfriend.

once i had her boyfriend's information, i sent him screenshots showing that Luna had cheated on him. this resulted in them breaking up and the boyfriend allegedly being sent to a psych ward.

i was then going to tell my boyfriend's ex, Jane, that he had cheated on her (she wasnt aware) but i didnt go through with it. she‚Äôs currently in a happy relationship and expecting a baby this summer and i couldnt bring myself to tell her that Ben had cheated on her with so many girls that he had lost count.

i even tested his loyalty by pretending to be a girl he used to hook up with and sent nudes that he had saved on his phone to make it look real. he didnt fall for it and instead became extremely paranoid.

in late may, he found out that his instagram had been hacked and reached out to Luna to see if she had been receiving messages, and she told him all about her breakup with her boyfriend. Ben confronted me about it and i admitted to what i had done. he was extremely angry with me. we were supposed to move in together but he secretly tried to break the lease without my knowledge or permission 4 days before moving in. i fought against this and kept the lease.

he drunkenly called me last wednesday to tell me that i was a fucking idiot for harassing Jane and that she‚Äôs a contractor at lockheed martin, which is affiliated with the cia and my actions couldve gotten us all killed. he berated me and told me i could‚Äôve gotten my two year old nephew assassinated. he said if i wanted forgiveness, that i should text my sister and apologise to her for almost getting her and her son killed. he kept saying it over and over and finally i just broke down and sent my sister that message.

he said if he wanted to, he could contact the fbi and cia and tell them i hacked into his account and stole nudes, which is a crime in our state. he said that he would sue me if he could, and if i fucked up again, that he would. he also said he hates me, doesnt respect me, and had a catalogue of women that he could have sex with and that he wishes he had physically cheated on me. he doesnt consider what he did cheating and believes that my actions are significantly worse, and he no longer feels sorry for sexting those girls. 

he said it‚Äôs because of bitches like me that he doesn‚Äôt think we should be allowed to vote or have jobs because all women do is fuck things up. he said if i wanted to be with him, even though he really doesnt want to be with me, then i have to stop thinking and listen to what i‚Äôm being told. he said i backed him into a corner by refusing to break the lease, and thats he wishes he couldve just sent my all my stuff back home without me knowing. he said that it feels like he‚Äôs in a prison when he‚Äôs with me.

he said a lot of things during this alcohol and adderall infused two hour rant, all of which i recorded. that phone call scared me. he was like a completely different person. i no longer feel safe around him. it also doesn‚Äôt help that he owns 5 firearms. 

i know i fucked up. i know i made terrible choices. i‚Äôm truly remorseful, but he doesn‚Äôt believe me. i‚Äôve since gone back on my meds. i can‚Äôt break the lease because it would cost $5k to do so, and i just can‚Äôt afford it. i feel like i‚Äôm walking on eggshells all the time. i cant cry because he thinks im just trying to manipulate him. i cant talk about how i feel because he made it clear that he doesnt care about my feelings. i tried to explain to him just how much that phone call scared me and he just brushed it off and said i had nothing to worry about as long as i didnt harass Jane, but he still doesn‚Äôt believe me when i say i didnt.

i‚Äôm living in a constant state of paranoia, of fear, of exhaustion, and depression. i dont know what to do anymore.

i wish i had never looked at his phone. i wish i had never done what i did. i wish i didn‚Äôt ruin everything, and i wish he would forgive me. everyone i talked to about this is worried about my safety. i‚Äôm worried too, but i feel like i‚Äôm stuck.

so yeah, i just wanted to share my story. i know its a bad one and i made bad choices. i‚Äôm just scared, and i don‚Äôt know what to do anymore.",1,1749543002.0,abusiverelationships,1,1.0,False

I met my friend last july at this summer job. I fell for her. We ended up having coffee a week after the one week job and then thats when i found out through my snooping that yeah, she has someone. A fiance, no less. However, I continued talking to her as if i didnt know also due to the fact...she hadn't told me. 

11 months later, she still hasn't told me. And yes, she doesnt really post him on her socials. They've been in a long distance relationship. 

We ended up getting really close. Hung out a lot. Especially recently. And tomorrow, we're getting lunch and seeing a movie together for my birthday. And yes, we've hung out exclusively just us together. And she hasn't told me she has a fiance. 

The other reason why I want to tell her my feelings is cause she's moving to another state in 2 weeks.

My damage is not bad, infact this is my 0 Cycle team for MOC, yet in DU its like im hitting the enemies with wet toilet paper, my damage runs in the millions everytime Castorice ults yet the enemies barely loses any HP.

This game isn't mechanically varied or deep enough to justify this insane HP pool, if this was FF10 where I had summons like Yamato, or Game breaking combos like Rikkus combine paired with multi hitting attacks like Wakka or Tidus to work around the insane HP quikly then its a different story but this game only has 3 buttons and for 90% of the characters your only using 2 of them.

There is also nothing that requires your attention, in other staple turn based games like FF10 and 7 and such you need to constantly despell oponents, keep haste on your characters, react to the oponents status effects and rotations etc to keep the fight engaging, in HSR auto battle does everything id have done, with the sole exception of saving some ults for oprotune moments like Ruan Mei or Hyacine to ensure 100% uptime.

Honestly im fine with the massive damage the enemies do, just decrease their HP by about 50% or something to just make fights less tedious, your just pressing the same buttons and seeing the same animation over and over ad nausium, I can even quote Hyacine, Tribbie and Castorice ultimates word for word at this point because they have to use it 50 times (exageration) every single fight.

1l7t3tt,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1l7t3tt/did_your_family_react_badly_when_you_quit/,Did your family react badly when you quit caffeine? Mine sure did.,"Long text ‚Äî no need to read it, really. I‚Äôm just venting. If anyone else has had difficult experiences with family/people after quitting caffeine, feel free to share! What I‚Äôve learned is that from now on, I‚Äôll just keep quieter about this and only talk about my experience if someone asks‚Ä¶ and if it turns into an argument, I won‚Äôt stay and fight, because it‚Äôs just not worth it. Lesson learned!

\---------------------------------------------------

I stayed at my father‚Äôs place for a couple of nights. I quit caffeine before Christmas last year, so I‚Äôve been off caffeinated drinks for over six months. I used to drink a whole pot of black coffee and energy drinks. I live in Finland, and here it‚Äôs common to drink coffee either black, with milk, or with oat milk. In Finland, sugary or creamy coffee isn‚Äôt really a thing (compared to the United States; I‚Äôve heard that over there people load their coffee with all kinds of syrups and creams). I‚Äôm just saying this so you understand what coffee culture is like in Finland. We drink a lot of coffee here; it‚Äôs a big part of our culture. It‚Äôs consumed from morning to evening, both at home and at work. Per capita, Finland drinks the most coffee in the world.

Anyway, my father was supposedly ‚Äúsurprised‚Äù when I said I‚Äôd be drinking tea and water at his place (even though I‚Äôve already told him a couple of times that I quit drinking coffee, and even reminded him a week before I came over). I said I‚Äôd bring my own tea, so my dad doesn‚Äôt have to buy any for me if he doesn‚Äôt want to.

He immediately started criticizing me. He wasn‚Äôt curious at all and didn‚Äôt want to believe me when I explained what‚Äôs happened to me over the past six months since I quit coffee: I told him my anxiety and stress levels have gone down, I sleep better, I have dreams, my muscles no longer twitch, and I‚Äôve had maybe six headaches total ‚Äî when I would normally have had at least 24 in that time span.

My dad istarted going on about how he‚Äôs never had any negative effects from coffee, how he started drinking it at age 13 in the ‚Äô70s, and how he‚Äôs been drinking it from morning to night ever since (his mother used to make coffee for the whole family). And that he sleeps well. He told me my stress is just from work, and nothing else (yes, my job ‚Äî which I hate ‚Äî is a source of stress, but that‚Äôs not the whole truth).

The conversation went pretty much like this: I didn‚Äôt get a word in, and my dad just boasted about how he has no negative symptoms from coffee and that I should quit this ‚Äúhippie nonsense‚Äù and start drinking coffee again. I told him it‚Äôs true that not everyone gets negative effects from coffee, and that gender, weight, age, etc. also play a role. My dad is a big guy, tall, so I‚Äôm not surprised if caffeine affects his body differently.

But since the conversation turned into an argument (I couldn‚Äôt really speak, I was constantly interrupted), I really felt like saying: are you *sure* caffeine doesn‚Äôt affect you at all?

My dad is a rather grumpy man and his sleep pattern has always been strange; he goes to bed between 9 and 11 PM and wakes up by 4:30 AM (because he can‚Äôt sleep any longer). Then around 11 AM he goes back to sleep and wakes up at 2 PM. He‚Äôs done this his entire adult life and I don‚Äôt know anyone else who does this. I‚Äôve understood that naps are supposed to be under 30 minutes anyway... But this is something he also gets mad about if you question it (even empathetically, out of concern).

My dad is overweight, takes about 10 different medications, and his joints crack. I can‚Äôt say how much of that is related to caffeine, but I do believe that if he even reduced his intake, he might notice some positive changes.

Well, I don‚Äôt have the energy to argue. I never once told my dad that *he* should cut back or quit ‚Äî I simply told him WHY *I* quit and WHAT BENEFITS I got. And he dismissed everything I said and half-shouted at me about how great caffeine is and how it‚Äôs the best thing ever‚Ä¶

My father has always been like this, by the way ‚Äî he‚Äôs not curious, but instead immediately slams his own opinion on the table and treats it as fact. I, on the other hand, am more flexible ‚Äî I‚Äôm open to hearing different opinions and experiences, because the truth, for example with caffeine, is that everyone reacts to it differently. Some people are much more sensitive, while others can drink a couple of cups and hardly feel anything, or the negative effects remain minimal.

What bothers me is that I felt like I had achieved something, and my father immediately tore me down and treated me like some ‚Äúcrazy hippie.‚Äù It‚Äôs frustrating that I can never really have a conversation with him ‚Äî I always get shut down. I try to live in a way where I don‚Äôt dictate how others should live their lives, but instead I prefer to share my own positive experiences and hope that it might open someone else‚Äôs mind a little. I don‚Äôt force my views on anyone.

Oh, and one acquaintance of mine actually reduced their coffee intake to just one cup a day after hearing that I had quit ‚Äî they wanted to see if it would have any effect. And it did ‚Äî positively. I told my dad this (half-jokingly), saying that maybe I‚Äôve had a positive influence on someone, and he dismissed that too, saying, *‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt influence anyone, they probably started drinking one cup because of the prices!‚Äù*

So yeah, that‚Äôs how it goes. Maybe I‚Äôm a narcissist for thinking like this ‚Äî who knows‚Ä¶",1,1749542579.0,decaf,5,0.67,False

I‚Äôve got the full story saved ‚Äî let me know if you want the link!","# Chapter 1 My Wife Has Violent Tendencies

As the heavy door of Ashwood Mental Hospital creaked open, a pale, slender woman stepped out. She was Audrey Patel. She covered her aching stomach and dragged her feet to walk, while the murmurs behind her followed like shadows.

Someone whispered, ""Mr. Patel's such a saint. He still sticks with her after she went nuts and hurt others with a knife.""

Another person said bitterly, ""If my wife pulled a stunt like that, I'd kick her out the same day. She's a total disgrace to Mr. Patel.""

Someone else chimed in, ""If Ms. Patterson's father hadn't passed away, and she hadn't moved in with her uncle, she would've married Mr. Patel ages ago. Audrey would never have had the chance.""

Audrey squinted against the harsh light and gave a bitter little smile.

Everyone knew the story. She was an orphan girl from some no-name town who somehow married Clayton Patel, a big-shot lawyer with a spotless image. People all said she won the lottery.

But now, with a reputation for being violent and unstable, fired from her job and fresh out of a mental hospital, she looked even more out of place next to Clayton.

Audrey thought bitterly, 'They all think I don't deserve him. Funny thing is, the one who stuck me in that hellhole and slapped that label on me was my perfect husband himself.'

It was July. The sun blazed down, but Audrey felt chilly all over, especially her heart.

Ashwood had a glossy cover story‚Äîsomething about correcting troubled youth and improving their mental state. But what went on inside was a nightmare.

Audrey, a 23-year-old grown woman, had been locked in there for a month because her husband claimed she was a danger and needed to have her mind straightened out.

During the past month, she was punished, starved, locked in pitch-black isolation‚Äîuntil she cracked, until she agreed she was wrong and promised to change.

Now, standing outside, breathing free air again, she watched Clayton hang up a call. His handsome face twisted with irritation.

""Zoe's ran a bath for you. Let's go home and wash off the bad luck,"" Clayton said to Audrey.

Audrey dodged the hand he reached toward her shoulder.

Clayton was always well-groomed with tailored suits and expensive cologne. But today, he didn't smell like his usual scent. Instead, he reeked of something sickly sweet, like overripe fruit. That scent made Audrey sick.

Ignoring Clayton's grim face, Audrey pulled open the passenger-side door and got in.

The driver, who'd already opened the back door, glanced at Clayton in confusion.

Clayton watched her, his lips pressed tight. He thought she was clearly still sulking after a month of confinement. He figured she wasn't used to that kind of strict environment, so she threw a tantrum.

Though he had his reasons, he still went too far to send her in against her will. So, for now, he didn't blame her for her little temper.

He sat in the back seat. The driver closed the door and started the car.

Audrey turned to the window and closed her eyes. The whole thing a month ago appeared in her mind.

It was her birthday that day. Clayton brought home a special guest‚Äîhis childhood friend, Valerie Patterson, and her three-year-old daughter, Luna Patterson.

While Clayton went to get the cake, Valerie grabbed a fruit knife and pressed it to her wrist, threatening to hurt herself if Audrey didn't give Clayton back to her.

Tears streamed down Valerie's face as she said she and Clayton were meant to be, that she came back to fix what they once lost.

Audrey lunged to stop Valerie and tried to snatch the knife just as Clayton walked in.

Valerie stumbled into Clayton's arms, sobbing like she'd just survived a war. ""Audrey, please don't hurt Luna. Clayton and I haven't done anything. You're getting it all wrong.""

Audrey stood frozen with the knife still in hand, her mind blanking out.

Valerie, still clinging to Clayton, glanced up at Audrey with a smug glint in her eyes. ""Clayton only let us move into your house 'cause we had nowhere else to go.

""I swear I'll pay back every penny he lent to us. Just don't scare my baby, okay? She's got autism.""

Clayton wrapped his arms around Valerie and Luna and shot a cold stare at Audrey. ""Valerie's hands are for painting. How could you hurt her?""

Little Luna, who watched the whole thing, just curled up tighter in Clayton's arms, shaking like a leaf.

Audrey let out a dry laugh, more from rage than amusement.

She thought to herself, 'So that's her game. She used my birthday party to air out her affair with Clayton. Either I suck it up and pretend my husband's got no side piece, or I pack my bags and quit the game.'

Audrey turned to Clayton, her voice firm. ""Believe it or not, she cut herself.""

""No way,"" Clayton shot back without missing a beat.

He was convinced no one knew Valerie's talent with a paintbrush better than he did. She would rather die than damage her hands. No chance she'd hurt herself just to frame Audrey.

Audrey scoffed and pointed straight at Valerie. ""Then tell me, why did you let them live in the house I bought and even gave them money? You're keeping her and her kid on the side, and I'm supposed to just be cool with it?""

Clayton's colleagues and a couple of his friends were right behind him. Being embarrassed like that in front of everyone clearly rattled him.

""My hand... Clayton, it hurts,"" Valerie whimpered, holding out her bleeding wrist, swaying like she was about to faint.

Guilt flashed across Clayton's face, but it was gone in a blink, replaced by anger. He barked at his assistant, ""My wife has violent tendencies. Send her to Ashwood Mental Hospital.""

Thinking back on it, Audrey put on a cold smile, sneering, 'To protect that woman's reputation, my husband threw me into that filthy place.'

Clayton must've caught that mocking look on her face, because for once, he tried to explain himself, ""I sent you to Ashwood to keep things from getting worse. You scared Luna.

""She had a fever for days. They've had a hard time. You shouldn't trash Valerie like that.""

Audrey opened her eyes, her gaze turning icy. ""I picked the house. I pay the mortgage. They're living in it and spending money from MY husband. Yeah, clearly I screwed up. I should've been more generous, huh?""

Clayton took a deep breath and said, ""Vally doesn't blame you. She's already dropped the charges. It won't affect you.""

Audrey sneered, thinking, 'Won't affect me? Due to my so-called violent tendencies you pinned on me, I lost my job three days after staying at Ashwood.'

Clayton and Valerie went way back. Years ago, both Valerie and Clayton's fathers got sick. Valerie's father gave up his shot at treatment and donated his kidney to save Clayton's father.

After that, Valerie and her mother moved out of town to live with her uncle. The night she turned up again, she was on the run. She was beaten by her husband, so she took her daughter to leave.

Clayton just happened to be on a business trip in that exact city. He swooped in like a hero, took on Valerie's divorce case, and brought her and her daughter back to Ironhaven.

\*\*\*\*\*

The car slowly rolled into Hightower Homes. Audrey didn't wait for it to stop but opened the door, got out, and headed straight for the elevator without a glance back.

She took a long shower and changed into clean clothes.

When she came out, Zoe was carrying dishes from the kitchen. She said with a smile, ""Dinner's almost ready, ma'am. Mr. Patel picked all your favorites.""

Clayton was on the couch going through some documents. He looked up over the rim of his gold-rimmed glasses and said, ""Dry your hair first. I'll wait to eat with you.""

Anyone walking in might've thought he was the picture of a devoted husband, setting aside legal briefs to dine with his wife.

But Audrey knew this was just his usual trick: slap you across the face and then hand you a candy.

Clayton took off his glasses and walked to the dining table. Pulling out a chair, he said, ""It's a bit late today. I'll have Zoe buy your favorite fish tomorrow.""

Audrey sat down without a word and picked up her fork.

Clayton was good at keeping his emotions locked up and hardly ever spoke more than necessary. Most of the time when they were together, Audrey always babbled him with some online gossip just to fill the silence.

Each time, Audrey would laugh out loud, yet Clayton was just calm and would sometimes give her a look to remind her of being composed.

Now, Audrey didn't even look at him. Worse, when he tried to serve her some food, she just picked it up and tossed it back onto the plate.

# Chapter 2 Don't Keep Pushing

Clayton tried to serve her more food, but Audrey stood up, dumped her utensils in the sink, and walked straight to the bedroom.

They had a nanny at home, but Audrey liked doing things herself. She used to cook Clayton's favorite meals and laid out his suits for the day. Zoe came in for an hour daily just to tidy up.

She used to think it was a sweet little routine between them, yet now, recalling what happened, Audrey felt like she was out of her mind in the past.

Clayton's mother, Lillian Patel, always thought Audrey was after Clayton's money. She made Clayton hand over half his paycheck every month for her to keep and said she'd return it when she was sure Audrey wasn't a gold digger.

Their finances had basically been split fifty-fifty since the wedding. And outsiders still loved gossiping about how Audrey married up, about her being some clingy, fame-hungry wannabe.

Audrey put up with all of it because she loved Clayton. But now? Now she couldn't believe how blind she used to be.

The husband she always felt proud of, the man who once stood for justice, fighting tooth and nail for unpaid factory workers, now threw his own wife under the bus to protect another woman's reputation.

Clayton's hand froze in the air, and he clearly felt the weight of her cold shoulder. He wiped his mouth with a napkin and knocked gently on the bedroom door. ""Audrey, I can explain that thing.""

From inside, Audrey let out a bitter laugh and thought, 'If you had anything to say, why didn't you say it a month ago in front of your coworkers, your friends, and in front of her? What's the act for now?'

She remembered that look in his eyes that night was nothing but irritation, and he said to her, ""You can leave Ashwood once you calm down.""

He even said, ""Vally and Luna have had it rough. If you're gonna make things worse for them, then maybe it's time you felt what being truly alone is like.""

He knew she was an orphan, and he always knew he was her only lifeline. But instead of standing by her, he sided with Valerie and crushed what little hope she had left.

When Valerie watched Audrey being dragged into Ashwood, she didn't even try to hide the satisfaction in her eyes. She smiled, as if saying, 'Say what you want, Clayton won't believe you. The more you fight it, the crazier you'll look.'

Audrey tried to break free from the nurses and scrambled back toward the hallway. With just one door between them, she heard Valerie sweet-talking Clayton, ""Clay, the doctor just said I can't draw anymore, but I can still have other jobs. Audrey only hurt me 'cause she loves you too much.""

Audrey didn't hear what Clayton replied because she was already forced into a room with bars on the windows.

She'd clenched her teeth and thought, 'If Clayton wants to play savior, he better chain himself to her for life. Just don't drag decent people down with them. I'm not interested in his lame excuse.'

Clearly thrown by Audrey's sudden silence, Clayton loosened his tie, feeling irritated without knowing why. He raised his voice to say, ""Why do you hate Vally so much? She's just a friend.""

Audrey didn't buy that for a second. She couldn't believe he still pretended not to know how Valerie felt for him.

After all, Valerie was jobless, divorced, and took her three-year-old daughter with autism back to Ironhaven and stepped into their life.

Audrey sneered inwardly, 'What kind of friend pushes others to divorce? What kind of friend throws herself into the arms of another woman's husband?'

If things kept going like this, Audrey knew she'd finally go crazy one day.

She suddenly flung the bedroom door open and sneered, ""Your family owes Valerie. That's your business, not mine. You want me to take care of your parents, but now I'm supposed to repay your debt too?""

She thought bitterly, 'Just because I married a superior and famous lawyer, I should play the good wife role? I didn't get any benefit from this marriage but got hurt mentally and physically.'

She looked him straight in the eye and said firmly, ""You were scared people would talk trash about her, so you told them I was violent and unstable. Her father saved your father, so you wanna sacrifice my reputation to protect her name?""

Her voice shook with rage. ""What right does she have to live in the house I bought and spend the money my husband gives her? What right do you have to send me to that darned mental hospital?""

Audrey had been holding her rage all in for too long, and now the dam burst. She let all her rage and her heartbreak out.

She hated Valerie for twisting the truth, but even more than that, she hated the man who once promised her a warm and safe home. She took a shaky breath, wiped her face, and realized her cheeks were wet with tears.

Clayton's expression turned more serious. He hadn't expected her to be this furious. Lowering his voice, he said, ""I know you lost your job, but I'll support you. Once Vally and Luna settle down, I'll hand over the rest of my paycheck to you.""

Audrey let out a long breath, feeling tired. She thought to herself, 'If I fall for his crap again, I'm the dumbest woman ever. You betrayed me once, and what makes you think I'll believe your promise again?'

She'd seen through him completely. Clayton's heart had already gone rotten. He'd always side with Valerie. This time, she was sent to Ashwood Mental Hospital. But she didn't know if she had a fight with Valerie again, what her heartless husband would do to her.

After all, she had no family. Clayton, as her legal guardian, had the power to do whatever he wanted.

Audrey looked at Clayton. Her eyes contained no more softness, no love, just a sheet of coldness.

She said, ""Don't bother dangling carrots in front of me. I got fired due to Valerie. You're gonna pay me 150,000 dollars. Then we get a divorce. You can play house with whoever you want after that.""

""I'm not divorcing you,"" Clayton shot back without hesitation.

Yanking off his tie, he flung it onto the couch. His chest felt tight, like he couldn't breathe. He thought, 'She wants a divorce over something so small? What the hell is wrong with her?'

The tie hit a decorative piece on the coffee table, knocking it to the floor. It shattered with a sharp crash, broken into pieces.

For once, the always-composed lawyer Clayton raised his voice. ""You lost your job, and I'll make it right. But divorce? Out of the question.""

He thought he'd already lowered himself enough. He was Clayton‚Äîthe admired, respected, and untouchable top-tier lawyer. Now that he was trying to meet her halfway, Audrey should've known when to quit.

But Audrey's eyes were colder than ever. There was even disgust in them.

Clayton suddenly felt something slipping out of his grasp. He couldn't name it, but the feeling irritated him more than he cared to admit.

He muttered, ""It's all in the past. Can't we let it go?""

""Clay? Is Audrey back?"" Valerie's voice rang out as she walked in, decked out in a Chanel dress, a Coach bag on her arm, and a pair of shining high heels.

Valerie was five years older than Audrey, but she dressed younger and more fashionably. Audrey had always been practical‚Äîsaving every cent to pay off the mortgage early, never splurging on luxury brands.

However, Valerie, a jobless single mother with a sick toddler, strolled in head-to-toe brands. It didn't take a genius to figure out who was footing the bill.

She stopped at the entryway, pretending to be shocked at the pieces on the floor. ""Audrey, if you've got a problem, take it out on me. My hand's ruined already. Go ahead and slash me again if it makes you feel better.

""That piece is a foreign art exhibit, you know? Clayton really likes it. It cost a few grand.""

Audrey let out a laugh that was anything but amused. ""Valerie, with that kind of imagination, you seriously missed your calling. You should be stalking celebs for gossip sites. I bought that piece, okay? How this involves you?""

Before Valerie could get a word in, Audrey turned to Clayton. ""You heard her, right? That thing's a foreign exhibit, cost 6,000 dollars. You broke it. You gotta pay.""

Valerie's eyes filled with tears instantly. She turned those helpless, wounded eyes toward Clayton. ""Clay, I thought you guys were arguing about me, so I‚Äî""

Clayton clenched his fists, feeling fed up. ""Vally's already forgiven you for what you did to her. You don't need to keep pushing.""

# Chapter 3 Clear The Mess

Valerie gently touched Clayton's arm and said, ""Clay, it's fine. I know Audrey hates me. I'll just leave now.""

But she didn't move a muscle. Instead, she looked up at Clayton with wide eyes, full of dependence and reluctance.

Clayton picked up the broken pieces and placed them on the coffee table. He was afraid Audrey might lose it again and end up hurting Valerie.

Clayton and Audrey got married just after they met each other. Back then, he was pissed at his family and randomly asked Audrey, who'd just dropped off a file at his law firm, if she'd marry him.

Audrey's reaction was unforgettable. She was first shocked, then pure joy. She told him she was an orphan, just landed a job at a foreign company, and didn't have much to offer compared to him. She promised she'd work hard, catch up to him, and be worthy.

Clayton made sure to sign a prenup, and the two of them got their marriage license without much fuss.

In the year since, Audrey worked her ass off at the office and at home. She arranged everything well, made his favorite meals, and never once complained.

Clayton could see how much she loved him in her eyes. He enjoyed being the center of her world. He believed she'd never actually leave him, and everything she said was just because she was angry.

Clayton said to Valerie, ""Vally, can you go back for now?""

""Huh?"" Valerie looked like she'd just been slapped.

Her eyes went wide in disbelief, and she thought, 'Is Clayton seriously kicking me out for Audrey?'

""I need to talk to Audrey. I'll come see you later,"" he added, looking at her with a gentler gaze, like trying to soothe a sulking child.

""Alright, I'll wait for you,"" Valerie said, but her heels didn't budge.

She turned to Audrey with a smile that barely masked her bitterness. ""Audrey, Clayton and I have known each other since we were kids. If anything were going to happen between us, it would've happened a long time ago. Don't you think?""

Just then, Zoe burst through the door, breathless. ""Ms. Patterson, come here, Luna collapsed. Her face is blue. I didn't dare move her.""

Valerie let out a sharp gasp and spun toward Clayton. ""What should I do? She had an episode yesterday too. Clayton, I'm scared.""

Clayton didn't hesitate. He turned around and went toward the living room. ""Calm down. Let's take her to the hospital right away.""

""Thank goodness you're here,"" Valerie said, sticking close to him. ""Feel my hands. I'm freezing.""

As Clayton grabbed his car keys, he suddenly thought of Audrey. His hand paused mid-air.

He turned back and looked at her, saying. ""Vally is still new to Ironhaven. She doesn't know the hospitals here. I'll take Luna to see the doctor first. Can we talk later?""

Audrey stared back at him, her face blank. She didn't give him any response.

Clayton frowned, and Valerie instantly took his arm and said, ""What if something happens to Luna? If she dies, I won't want to live.""",1,1749542506.0,Contemporary_Romance,0,1.0,False

# Best Round Fire Pit Table 2025: Reviews & Buying Guide

The round fire pit table has rapidly become a staple in outdoor living spaces, offering not only warmth and ambiance but also serving as a functional centerpiece for gatherings.These tables provide a beautiful focal point for entertaining guests, enjoying family time, or simply relaxing outdoors. As we head into 2025, the market is flooded with options, making it challenging to choose the best one for your needs. This guide is designed to provide a comprehensive review of top-rated round fire pit tables,highlight key features,and offer valuable insights to help you make an informed decision. From gas-powered models to wood-burning options, we'll explore the pros and cons of each type, ensuring you select the perfect addition to your patio, deck, or backyard.

## Key Features Analysis

The selection process for the best round fire pit table involves careful consideration of several key features. These factors considerably impact the table's performance, durability, and overall user experience.

**BTU Output:** The BTU (British Thermal Unit) output is a crucial factor in determining the amount of heat the fire pit table can generate. A higher BTU output typically means a warmer and more powerful flame. For larger outdoor spaces, a fire pit table with a BTU output of 50,000 or higher is recommended, while smaller patios might suffice with a 30,000-40,000 BTU model.

**Material Construction:** The materials used in the construction of the fire pit table directly affect its longevity and resistance to the elements. Common materials include powder-coated steel, aluminum, and composite materials like Envirostone. Powder-coated steel offers good durability and rust resistance, while aluminum is lightweight and naturally corrosion-resistant.Envirostone provides a natural stone look and is exceptionally durable.

**Ignition System:** The ignition system is essential for easy and reliable start-up of the fire pit. Most modern fire pit tables feature electronic ignition systems, often with a simple push-button start. this eliminates the need for matches or lighters, providing a safer and more convenient way to ignite the flame. Some models also include a safety valve that automatically shuts off the gas supply if the flame is extinguished.

**Table Dimensions:** The dimensions of the round fire pit table are crucial for ensuring it fits comfortably in your outdoor space and accommodates your seating arrangement. Consider the diameter of the tabletop and the height of the table to ensure it provides a comfortable surface for placing drinks and snacks while also allowing for ample legroom. A table that is to large can overwhelm a small patio, while a table that is too small may not provide sufficient surface area.

**Safety Features:** Safety should be a top priority when selecting a fire pit table. Look for models that include safety features such as a flame failure device,which automatically shuts off the gas supply if the flame is extinguished. Additionally, a spark screen or guard can help prevent embers from escaping, reducing the risk of fire hazards. Ensuring the fire pit table is CSA or UL certified provides added assurance of safety and quality.

**Fuel Type:** Fire pit tables can use different fuel types,including propane and natural gas. Propane models are portable and require a propane tank, which is typically stored within the table's base. Natural gas models require a gas line connection and are therefore more permanent. Consider the convenience and accessibility of each fuel type when making your decision.

1l7t104,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackNovel/comments/1l7t104/where_to_readface_burning_in_betrayal_love_novel/,"Where to read""Face Burning in Betrayal Love Novel"" - The night before my wedding,I had a tragic accident that destroyed my face with burns.","The night before my wedding,I had a tragic accident that destroyed my face with burns.When I woke up in the hospital,my fianc√©,Nathaniel Cross,had married my step-sister,Evelyn,in my¬†[place.My](http://place.my/)¬†family supported their marriage,acting as if I never existed.

I,who lost everything overnight,was left to face the taunts and insults of people on every corner of the city,the whole world discarding me,mocking a model whose face was now ruined.

I was frustrated and wanted to [die.As](http://die.As) I was about to jump from the top floor of the hospital,Darius Vance hugged me.He was the plastic surgeon who took care of my face,appearing as a savior.

He promised me a new face,a new life,and sincere love when I married him.Every day he treated me with affection,assuring me that the world would be okay with him.I believed him.

However,two years later,I found the medical records of a gruesome secret surgery and Darius'open laptop showing a special¬†[folder.In](http://folder.in/)¬†the footage I shudderingly watched,Darius stood by the operating table,talking to someone.

""Evelyn,don't worry.After this accident,your step-sister's face will be destroyed.Nathaniel will definitely leave her,and you can take her place.""

""Then what about her?""Evelyn's voice sounded doubtful and gave my weakly lying body a quick glance.

""Don't worry.I will'save'her.I'll make sure she only depends on me forever without bothering you and Nathaniel.""

My eyes that were blurred with tears were forced to watch the video until the end.The video explained that Darius loved Evelyn very much and the medical records beside the laptop showed that Darius performed an illegal operation on me.It turns out that what I thought was marriage and redemption was just a game full of deception-they destroyed everything I had in the past,and now,revenge begins.It's time for them to go to the abyss and enjoy the darkness!

I will rise,take revenge,leave,and I will never forgive.

\*\*\*

Tonight,I returned home early from the vacation trip that Darius himself had planned for me.

After entering Darius'boudoir,my eyes fell on his laptop that was still on.That wasn't Darius'habit.Curiosity got the better of me when I saw the strange folder displayed on the screen and a medical note beside the laptop.

The folder had a title that made the world around me feel like it was spinning.

\[Evelyn my love.\]

All about Evelyn.Many videos of Evelyn were displayed there,but my attention was drawn to one old video.

My eyes that were blurred with tears were forced to watch the video until the end.The video explained that Darius loved Evelyn very much and the medical records beside the laptop showed that Darius performed an illegal operation on me.

The tightness was hard to bear,my heart aching like it had been pierced by thousands of needles.This reality brought my nightmares and past traumas to life.

Unbelievable,the mastermind behind all the bad things that had happened to my life so far turned out to be the person closest to me‚ÄîDarius‚Äîwho I considered my protector from everyone.

I glanced at Darius who was fast asleep on the sofa,he was too careless to think I hadn't returned from vacation.

While I was still reeling,a message app notification popped up on Darius'laptop from someone named Calvin.Without hesitation,I opened it completely.

\[Darius,are you really sure you're going to keep changing your wife's face bit by bit to look more and more like Evelyn?\]

My knees felt weak as I read it.

\[Very [sure.You](http://sure.You) can just take care of the secret operation letter as usual.Audrey is even taking a vacation out of town before another face surgery the day after tomorrow,I made her think I was giving her some fun,when here I am erasing the longing of spending time with Evelyn.""\]

\[Evelyn has returned?You're pretty crazy.But Audrey isn't Evelyn,I feel a little sorry for [her.How](http://her.How) much longer are you going to treat her as a replacement?\]

\[I can't get Evelyn completely because she loves Nathaniel,but I can recreate her.Audrey just needs a little more...then she will become Evelyn in another form.\]

The messages hit me to close the laptop neatly immediately,unable to read the whole thing anymore.I tried hard to keep my mouth shut so as not to let out a sob that might wake Darius.

I finally realized that I was just a puppet for the man who was supposed to be my savior.

My steps faltered as I walked out of Darius'[boudoir.My](http://boudoir.my/)¬†chest tightened as if rejecting the reality I had just discovered.

I almost fainted.

\*\*\*

The toilet became my target to look in the mirror.

How much of me was still real?

I felt my own face.It's still me,but there are some things that have changed little by little to look like Evelyn.I didn't dare to look at my face all this time,I was still traumatized by the burnt face of my past.Darius always praised my beauty and I trusted him too much for all the surgeries I underwent.

Maybe I should leave here.I walked out of the restroom,but my steps stopped when Darius came out of his boudoir and called me from behind.

""Honey?When are you coming home?""

I'm stunned for a few moments and not ready to turn around.Darius'voice no longer sounded sweet to my ears.His words of affection were more like nonsense.

""How was your vacation?It must have been great to spend time alone.""

My tongue twisted as I turned to look at Darius.

""It was fun.""

The friendly look on Darius'face changed to surprise at my bloodshot eyes.

""What happened to you on the road,dear?""Darius came closer.""You were crying.I'll make those who made you sad regret it.""

It was you.

My legs were too weak to move back as Darius approached and then embraced me with a warmth that felt fake.I felt like pushing Darius away,but in reality I could only stay still.

And the trembling of my body attracted the attention of Darius who immediately released the hug.His eyes looked at me intently,giving me a worried look.""So what's wrong?""

A spontaneous answer flashed through my brain.""I was mugged.""

His jaw turned hard as if he was really angry.""Damn it.I shouldn't have let you go home alone!I'll find the culprit who made my precious wife sad!""

I forced a smile.""I'm fine.""

Darius hugged me again tightly,as if I was still the old Audrey‚Äîthe blind,weak,and dependent Audrey.

""I saw your missed call earlier,""he muttered regretfully.""I'm sorry for falling asleep,I was too tired after a day of surgery at the hospital.""

Surgery at the hospital?

My lips quivered in mockery.I even knew very well what he had been doing all day.Not holding a scalpel,but touching Evelyn.

Darius sighed and pulled my hand gently,kissing it like he was the most loving man in the world.""Let's go to bed,[dear.You](http://dear.You) must need some rest because you're exhausted.""

I wanted to refuse,wanted to shut myself away and spew out all the hatred I felt,but I couldn't show anything but silence and obedience.I was too shocked and Darius was horrible to me.

\*\*\*

The next morning,I gasped as my body was lifted off the bed by Darius.He carried me gently,leading me to the car.

""Where are we going?""my voice was hoarse,still trapped in the residual trauma of last night.

He just smiled,starting the engine.""I've prepared a special breakfast for you in a beautiful place.""

My heart was beating wildly.""But I haven't even showered yet.""

Darius gave me a quick glance with a big smile behind the wheel.""You're always beautiful,baby.""

Disgust immediately attacks my throat.

The nature-themed restaurant we'd come to looked serene,with perfectly set tables.But I couldn't feel anything but restlessness.

Darius pulled out my chair gently,sitting across from me with a sharp look.I tried to grip the spoon,but my hands were shaking.

""Are you sick?""Darius asked,his voice full of concern.""Your face is so pale.""

I gasped.""I'm...just tired after yesterday's trip.""

""You should rest well,""he said lightly,then took a sip of coffee.""Because tomorrow is your scheduled surgery.""

Surgery.Again.

My chest heaved.Despite knowing,I was still shocked and fear crept into my mind.

""I don't want another surgery,Darius,""my voice trembled,almost drowned out by the sound of the rain that began to fall lightly outside.

He put down his fork slowly.His eyes darkened,his expression still soft,but there was something that made my hair stand on end.

""Honey,don't I always know what's best for you?""His lips curved in a faint smile.""You want to be more beautiful,don't you?""

If I had heard this in the past,I might have been touched.But right now,I want to scream.I want my face back.I want my life back.

""We'll talk about that another time,now let's enjoy breakfast.""

Darius told me to eat,but he was busy playing with his cell phone for a few¬†[minutes.My](http://minutes.my/)¬†mind was full.The matter of the surgery that would eventually happen,made me uneasy.

""Darius,I really don't want surgery,""I said hesitantly and quietly.

Darius was about to say something,but his cell phone rang.I caught a glimpse of a flash of expression on his face‚Äîa twinkle that was too quickly hidden.But I saw it.

The voice on the other end spoke briefly,and his face changed.

""Honey,I have to go to the hospital.I have an emergency patient.""

I didn't believe [him.It](http://him.It) was a lie.

Darius stood up in a hurry,""You can take your own taxi home,okay?""

Then he was gone.

I sat there in silence,looked up at the darkening [sky.It](http://sky.It) was starting to rain harder.

I had to get home before the storm came.

As I walked out of the restaurant,the raindrops brushed my face.The streets were deserted.There were no taxis passing by.I knew it would happen during the rainy season.

I decided to run through the rain.Every step felt heavy.

Then a taxi pulled up near me.

I stiffened,my steps delayed.

Too fast.Too coincidental.

The driver's window lowered slowly,revealing a man dressed all in black with a grinning smile.

""Hop in,pretty lady.""

I stepped back,my heart racing.""No,thank you.""

The man tilted his head.""What do you mean no?""his voice turned cold.""Do I look like I'm giving you a choice?""

Fear swallowed me whole.

Before I could escape,his hands had already grabbed my arms,pulling me roughly into the car.I screamed,trying to struggle,but his grip was too strong.

In a panic,I slammed into his knee with all my might.

He growled,releasing me for a moment.That was enough.

I pushed open the door and ran into the pouring rain,my breathing ragged.I heard footsteps behind me.He was chasing me.

Darius.

That was the only name that came to my mind.

I don't have anyone else.Even though Darius pretended to love me,he could at least help me.

My hands trembled as I reached into my pockets,looking for my cell¬†[phone.My](http://phone.my/)¬†fingers were wet and slippery as I dialed the number.I put the phone to my ear,hoping to hear his calm voice soon.

But there was no answer.

I pressed again.Still no answer.

""Darius...pick up!""I whispered frantically,my eyes glancing back.The man was still chasing me,getting closer.

I typed a message with trembling hands:

\[Darius,help me.There's someone chasing me.I'm scared.\]

There was no reply.

I typed again quickly:

\[I'm in danger!Answer my phone,please!\]

Still silent.

Shit!I bit my lip,running faster.

However,the man was faster.

I screamed as a hand grabbed my shoulder and pulled me backwards.I fell to the wet ground,the cell phone I was holding tightly cracked slightly.

""How dare you run away!""the man whispered,gripping my chin roughly.

I struggled,kicking him,but my body was too weak compared to his strength.

""Too bad,""he held up something that glinted in the rain‚Äîknife light.""Your pretty face will change a bit now.""

I struggled,trying to pull away,but the knife slid quickly.

Heat flashed across my cheek.

I screeched.Blood flowed,mixing with the rainwater.The pain was piercing,but I couldn't stop.I kicked with all my strength,right between his legs.

The man growled,his grip weakening.I used the opportunity to get on all fours and run,not caring that my feet were almost dragging on the asphalt.

I headed back home with legs that didn't stop running even though they were shaking.

""I need Darius,I'm so scared!""

My own shouting encouraged me to get home quickly.I saw Darius'car parked,he was home.Good.I really need his hug even if it's fake,at least it protects me from the evil of strangers.

I made it into the¬†[house.My](http://house.my/)¬†pain-filled steps slowed at the threshold of my open bedroom door.I heard a voice that was familiar to me.Completely familiar.Evelyn.Two years I didn't find her anywhere,now I saw her.

Darius and¬†[Evelyn.In](http://evelyn.in/)¬†my room.

My heart seemed to stop for a moment.

My eyes watered as Evelyn's voice sounded flirtatious,""Are you sure she'll comply for the surgery tomorrow?""

Darius chuckled,his hand caressing Evelyn's cheek.""After what happened today?She must have no other choice.""

I held my breath,my body freezing.

""Are you sure your men are doing it right?""Evelyn asked again,her hands creeping up Darius's chest.""What if Audrey comes and sees us fooling around in your room?""

""It's not supposed to happen,""Darius replied casually.""Then we'll see that her face is pretty badly scarred.If she sees herself in the mirror tomorrow morning,she'll cry and beg me to fix it.""

My heart sank.This was worse than anything I had ever¬†[imagined.My](http://imagined.my/)¬†hand covered my own mouth,stifling the sob that almost escaped.

Evelyn chuckled.""You're absolutely brilliant.""She turned sullen,""but I don't understand why you're still being nice to her.Have you started falling for Audrey already?""

""Started falling love?All I see is you,even though you belong to someone else.I just don't want Audrey to run away forever,I'll be lonely without your shadow.""

I wanted to turn around,wanted to escape this nightmare.But before I could move,I saw Evelyn pull Darius'face and kiss him.

""But now you can have me,""she whispered.""I'm [here.You](http://here.You) can enjoy the real Evelyn.""

I should have left.But instead I was stuck in place,watching Evelyn push Darius onto the bed.

""I know I already have Nathaniel and you have Audrey.But are you going to reject our intimacy?""

""There's no way I'm turning you down,""Darius shook his head firmly with eyes misty with passion.""You're the center of my world after you willingly got shot to save my kidnapping four years ago.""

I don't understand what happened between them four years ago,but here I stand as a victim of Evelyn and the selfish Darius.And to my recollection,Evelyn had never been shot in her life.

""You know,""Darius murmured,his voice low and full of passion,""no matter how many surgeries Audrey undergoes,she'll never be as beautiful as you.""

I closed my eyes tightly,but those words were already etched into my brain.

I knew what they would do¬†[next.My](http://next.my/)¬†breath hitched as the sound of sighing from inside the room became clearer.Evelyn said Darius'name in a way that destroyed what was left of my sanity.

Unable to take it anymore,I turned around and walked as fast as I could to the restroom at the end of the hall.Once inside,I locked the door and staggered back,my body shaking uncontrollably.

Darius hadn't just destroyed my face.He destroyed my soul.

I couldn't forever be a puppet for the two of them.Darius,whom I once loved so much,had to be left behind.I have a plan,but on the other hand I realize I'm not completely strong.

My trembling hands picked up the slightly cracked cell phone.I thought for a long time,until finally without hesitation I pressed a number that I hadn't called in a long time.""Alaric,my brother,I'm in danger and need your help.‚Äù

A few seconds of silence on the other side of the phone.Then,his voice came on.""Audrey...I can hardly believe you would call me.Okay,tell me about your problem and let's make a plan.""

\[Honey,where are you?I'll pick you up.\]

My lips twitched mockingly at a recent message on my cell phone.

Darius.I guessed that Darius's men had already informed him that I ran away,so Darius panicked and contacted me this [quickly.Now](http://quickly.Now),I was standing outside the house as if I hadn't gone inside earlier.

I typed an amused reply to Darius.

\[I'll be home soon.\]

The reply from Darius came quickly.

\[Just wait.I'll pick you up.\]

Shortly after that,the door of Darius'house opened.Revealing Darius who was moving in a hurry,now turned frozen.His face turned pale when he saw me standing here.

""Please don't misunderstand,Audrey,""Darius'voice trembled,panicked.He turns to Evelyn and then his gaze returns to me.""Evelyn came looking for you.We have no relationship whatsoever.""

Lies.I knew his fear wasn't for fear of losing me‚Äîit was because I could ruin his plans.I could refuse the final surgery to transform myself completely into Evelyn.

Next to Darius,Evelyn stood relaxed,her lips curled sardonically.There was no shock there at the sight of me,only a taunt that stabbed like a dagger.

My heart was boiling.Evelyn,my once cherished step-sister,was now the taker of everything.She trampled my life,stole everything without a trace‚Äîand lastly,she even took Darius.

My hands clenched into fists.Without giving Darius a chance to speak further,I delivered a hard slap to his face.

Darius was silent for a few seconds.I held my breath,afraid he would retaliate.

""Are you crazy?!Darius is innocent!""screeched Evelyn,her eyes glaring at me.

I was disgusted.I hated Evelyn's voice.I hate her face.I raised my hand,ready to slap her‚Äî

But Darius gripped my wrist firmly.His gaze was sharp,cold.""Don't hurt Evelyn.""

The world seemed to¬†[collapse.My](http://collapse.my/)¬†heart broke at the way Darius protected her.This one was clearly sincere,unlike what he always did to me.

But then,suddenly,he pulled me into his arms.His face was soft again.

""Honey,I'm sorry.""His voice turned warm,as if he was the same man as before.""Are you angry that I was late picking you up?Your face...why?""

I stare blankly.This hug usually makes me feel safe.But now all I felt was emptiness.

Darius led me inside.We sat on the sofa in the main room.

""Alright dear,you can tell me later about what [happened.Now](http://happened.Now),I need to treat your face quickly.""

I could only nod in resignation.Darius not only came to me with medicine,but also with a mirror.

I knew Darius was watching me.Waiting for my reaction.

I froze when Darius handed me the mirror.""Look at your wound first,[dear.You](http://dear.You) can't be too sad,your face is still beautiful.""

Darius'words were a lie.

I knew what he meant‚Äîhe wanted me to see the wound on my face,then I'd get scared,and I'd give in and ask for surgery.

And damn it,I was really scared.

Hesitant,I stared at my reflection in the mirror with a pounding¬†[heart.My](http://heart.my/)¬†cheeks now had sores,swelling and dried blood.Instantly,memories of the past when my face was destroyed surfaced,making my breathing feel labored.I bit my lip,holding back the trembling in my hands.

Darius displayed a small smile that he tried to cover up.""What's wrong,dear?Are you still scared?""

I didn't answer.

He reached out,touching my cheek gently,as if in love.""Well,your face is injured.You'd better not postpone the surgery for tomorrow.""

I closed my eyes as the tears fell.

""Don't be afraid,""Darius said.

He took the bandages and ointment,then sat closer,touching my face gently.The touch that once made me feel loved.

""This will sting a little,""he said softly,applying the medicine to the wound on my cheek.

It was hot,stinging.I winced.

""I'm sorry,""he said softly,his fingers brushing over the dried blood on my forehead.""I shouldn't have let this happen to you.""

I wanted to laugh.Didn't he cause all this himself?

I could feel his intense gaze.As if there was a hint of guilt there.As if he really cared.

And just then,Evelyn moved.

""Ouch...""the weak voice came from the side.

Darius immediately turned his head.His worried gaze was evident.""Evelyn?""

Without bothering to take care of me anymore,Darius immediately got up to Evelyn.""What's wrong with you?""

I chuckled.Darius forgot his own charade as he was so worried about Evelyn.

Evelyn touched her temple,her expression pale.""I'm...dizzy...""

""What are you feeling?""

""I don't know...""Evelyn whispered weakly.""It feels like my head is spinning...""

""Lie down for a while,""he said softly,his eyes full of worry.

Evelyn nodded,her body looking limp as Darius helped her lean back into the sofa.

I stared at the¬†[scene.My](http://scene.my/)¬†medicine that was in his hand is now neglected on the table.The wound on my cheek still stung,but Darius didn't care.

""I need a drink,""Evelyn said,easily getting Darius to comply and go to the kitchen.

I sighed,disgusted.I couldn't bear to look at Evelyn any longer.

I got up from the sofa,intending to leave.I couldn't bear to linger in this room.

But suddenly,Evelyn's fingers gripped my wrist.

""From the expression on your face,""she whispered softly,yet sharply,""it looks like you already know everything.""

My body stiffened.I turned my head,and one side of Evelyn's lips lifted.Creating a satisfied smile that I wanted to destroy.

I rudely removed my hand from Evelyn.""I don't want to see your face again,Evelyn!""

""You already know everything,right?""Her tone was light,as if this was just a normal conversation.""I don't care how you know.I just want to tell you one thing...""

She leaned in,looking up at me with a smile that was so annoying.""You're pathetic.""

I clenched my fists.

""I took everything from you.Your life,your future,even the people who were supposed to be by your side.And look at you now,""she continued,her eyes flashing triumphantly.""You tried to be me,but still‚Äîjust a failed puppet.""

Her chuckle sounded like nails hitting my skull.

I clenched my fists,holding back the turmoil in my chest.

Evelyn chuckled.""Look,your hands are shaking.You're scared,aren't you?Scared to see your scarred face?""She leaned closer to my ear.""You almost died from that a long time ago.""

""Shut up!""I looked at her sharply.

I turned around,but something happened so fast.Evelyn moved to the table,reaching for the fruit knife that had been there.I reflexively stepped back,my mind instantly on alert.

But Evelyn‚Äî

She sliced the knife into her own arm.Although it was slow,it was enough to draw blood from her arm.

I was shocked and froze.Evelyn let out a small groan,then dropped the knife to the floor,right by my feet.

Darius's steps sounded from the kitchen.

While I was still trying to comprehend what happened,Evelyn had already backed away,her face filled with feigned panic.Her eyes were glazed over,her body trembling slightly.

""Audrey...""her voice trembled,full of hurt.""I know I replaced you as Nathaniel's bride,but I just wanted to apologize and visit you,but you attacked me out of the blue.‚Äù

Darius appeared.His gaze immediately fell to the wound on Evelyn's arm‚Äîand to the knife on the floor.

""What happened?!""

Evelyn bit her lip,trying to look scared.""I...I don't know...I just said I wanted to fix our relationship,but suddenly Audrey got angry...""She looked down,taking a shaky breath.""Then she took the knife.""

Shit.

My eyes widened.""Evelyn,you're lying!""I stepped forward because I was annoyed with Audrey's acting,but she immediately stepped back,as if getting scared.

Darius looked at me sharply,none of the usual gentleness radiating from him for me.""Audrey...did you do it?""

My mouth opened,but before I could answer‚Äî

The front door opened roughly.

Someone came in.

""What did you do to Evelyn?!""

Nathaniel.

I still felt hurt looking at that face.The way he betrayed me by marrying Evelyn...still burns in my heart.

His eyes bulged with worry when he saw the wound on Evelyn's arm.His gaze then shifted to me,and within seconds,his anger exploded.

Evelyn gave a small gasp,her body trembling.""Nathaniel...""her voice was weak,as if frightened.""I...I'm okay...""

But Nathaniel didn't believe that.He stepped closer to me,his face hardening.Nathaniel pushed my body away.And Darius stayed where he was,not defending me.

""So this is why you kidnapped her!You're mentally ill,Audrey!""

I couldn't say anything.

Evelyn had won this round.

How¬†[pathetic.My](http://pathetic.my/)¬†body shook with the anger of being accused and the memory of their betrayal.The two people I once loved so much were now standing in front of me cursing,cornering me in defense of another woman.

""Audrey,I just want to apologize...""Evelyn spoke softly.

I couldn't take any more of [this.It](http://this.It) was enough.I chose to turn around and leave along with the tears that¬†[fell.My](http://fell.my/)¬†hands were clenched tightly into fists.

\*\*\*

Evelyn had left with Nathaniel.

And later that night,Darius came to our room to apologize.I knew he was doing this just to keep me in surgery tomorrow.I played along with his game,forgiving him as if nothing bad had ever happened between us.

Darius trusted me,even though I had a plan.Before Darius went to bed,I put sleeping pills in his drink.

As soon as his breathing became regular,I got up.

I sneak out,my steps¬†[light.In](http://light.in/)¬†front of the boudoir,my heart beats fast.

The doorknob turned easily.Darius is too confident.Inside,I head straight for his laptop.The screen is dark,locked.I type in Evelyn's date of birth.

There was a click.

I almost laughed.Darius really couldn't think beyond Evelyn.

But that didn't matter now.I inserted the USB,opening file after file‚Äîa trail of illegal transactions,falsified medical records,their intimate messages.Clear evidence of their betrayal and crimes.

My phone vibrates.A message from someone helping me behind the scenes.

\[Follow the [plan.Do](http://plan.Do) not act outside the instructions.All data has been transferred?\]

I checked the copying [process.It](http://process.It) was almost complete.I typed quickly,\[Already.Tomorrow morning,I will have surgery.\]

A few seconds later,a reply came.

\[Don't worry.I'll make sure everything goes as we planned.\]

I closed the laptop,erasing the trace without a trace.Everything was ready.

When I returned to the room,Darius was still asleep.I stood at the edge of the bed,staring at him silently.This man I once loved,I once gave my all [to.Now](http://to.Now),he was the one who destroyed me the most.

I lay beside him,staring at the ceiling with a smile that wasn't necessarily happy.There was bitterness,pain and contentment.

""I can't wait for tomorrow.‚Äù

\*\*\*

The next morning,Darius and I immediately went to the hospital.I thought Darius was going to take me to the surgery room,but he turned to another room¬†[instead.My](http://instead.my/)¬†steps stopped right in front of a room with an open door.

I saw Evelyn lying on the patient's bed and there was my¬†[family.My](http://family.my/)¬†breath caught,I glanced at Darius sharply,asking for an explanation.

""Evelyn is pregnant.Yesterday she begged to bring you together one last time,""Darius said casually.

My blood rushed.A trap.

Darius is no longer pretending.He'll probably end all the charades once I'm out of surgery.

My gaze shifted to my family who were staring at me like enemies.The pain piled up,making me no longer recognize the warmth of my own family.I was about to leave,but my stepmother slapped me hard.""How could you hurt Evelyn yesterday!If she dies,what about the baby?""

I looked to my father for a defense,but his gaze was [cold.No](http://cold.No) one believes me here.

""I'm disappointed in you,Audrey.Daddy never taught you to do anything bad to your stepsister!""

I laughed bitterly,holding back the tears that were about to burst.""You trust Evelyn more than me?I am your biological daughter,Dad.Evelyn is not.""

""Don't talk as if you're a victim,""stepmother said sharply.""In fact,you were just jealous of Evelyn all along.Admit it!""

I tried to control my emotions,but my body was shaking.They had already dumped me.Evelyn had taken all my places-not just in Darius's heart,but in my own family.

I turned and left with long strides,until Darius hugged me from behind.

""Honey,I'm sorry.I didn't know it would end like this.""Darius's whisper was so soft,as if he actually felt sorry for me.He turned me around.""Your family doesn't care about you anymore.""

I felt a small smile on his faint lips.He was enjoying it‚Äîseeing me alone with no one.Because if no one cares for me,I'm only his.

""But you still have me.""Darius grabbed my fingers and held them firmly.""We'll be [happy.Now](http://happy.Now) you go into the surgery room,while I need to prepare long enough for a perfect result.""

When Darius left,someone named Calvin came to help escort me to the surgery room.I remembered him.The name I'd seen in the secret message on Darius'laptop.He was part of this plan.

""Please come in,""he said briefly,opening the door with a flat expression,as if this was a normal routine.

As soon as Calvin left me inside,I immediately contacted¬†[someone.My](http://someone.my/)¬†voice was low,almost a whisper.""I'm already inside.""

Before long,someone jumped in through the window.His movements were quick,practiced.He kept the documents I had collected on the bed‚Äîphotos of evidence of Darius's crimes and betrayals,and the divorce papers I had signed without hesitation.

Finally,he helped me escape to continue with my next plan.

Twenty minutes later.

Darius strode casually along the hospital corridor.Everything was perfectly organized-so he thought.

He pushed open the surgery room door with confidence,only to greet an empty room.His brow furrowed.

Just as his confusion peaked,Calvin appeared with bated breath.

""Audrey went to the toilet?""asked Darius,trying to contain his anxiety.

Before Calvin could answer,a bodyguard suddenly rushed in:""No!Darius!Audrey already knows the whole truth.She just committed suicide by jumping off the roof of the hospital!""

Blade: Gillette Nacet 

Brush: Semogue 830

Soap: Macduffs Morning Ritual


First SOTD I‚Äôve posted in weeks, due to the fact that most of the previous shaves were pretty shitty, but this one was perfect, so I had to share it. Shave was better because of two things. One, I did a perfect XTG pass, which made ATG much easier, with no struggling at all. And two, I used absolutely no pressure at all. My extremely sensitive neck area really enjoyed that, as all 3 passes were very comfortable with no weepers, nicks or irritation. Post shave was not required at all. 

Morning Ritual is exactly what a freshly baked chocolate cake on a Christmas evening sounds like, full of sweetness and a touch of roasted coffee. Lather was amazing. I seem to get the best lather out of my 830 by far. The 610 is not as good for me. ",0,1749542192.0,wicked_edge,0,0.5,False

‚ÄúLuna, I‚Äôm deeply sorry for your loss. Iona‚Äôs passing is truly heartbreaking. I can‚Äôt imagine how it must feel to lose such a little angel,‚Äù the healer said as he approached me, fresh from the examination room. The moment those words left his mouth, my legs gave way, and I sank to the floor.

I couldn‚Äôt believe it‚Äîthe very first thing he told me was such devastating news. It felt like my entire world crumbled in an instant. Iona was only four years old, and her fifth birthday was just weeks away.

The attack that happened in the early hours of this morning turned everything upside down, shattering everything I‚Äôd worked so hard to protect for so long. It was chaos, pure and utter chaos, and now the cost was far greater than I could have ever imagined.

The most painful part of all this suffering was when Nathaniel ignored me as I lay helpless on the ground with Iona, both of us barely clinging to life while trying to escape. He was too preoccupied helping Yoan and her son, Dane.

Yoan and Nathaniel had been childhood friends, their bond running deep long before Nathaniel even met me.

When he found me gravely injured and Iona unconscious, trapped beneath the rubble of the packhouse, he chose to turn away. He merely called for members of the Pack Medical Centre before focusing his attention elsewhere.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs only fainted and in shock, Yoan. Let‚Äôs check on your son first‚Äîhe‚Äôs in worse condition,‚Äù he had said at the time.

Nathaniel‚Äôs words still ring in my ears, their indifference cutting deeper than the wounds on my body. To him, Iona was simply unconscious, nothing to worry about. But now, as she lies lifeless before me, I can‚Äôt understand how he could've dismissed her so easily.

I sat sobbing in the corner of the room, my body trembling, utterly drained of strength. It felt as though every ounce of energy I once had had vanished, leaving me as nothing more than an empty shell. Iona‚Äôs small body lay motionless on the bed, her once-cheerful face now eerily serene, as though she were merely sleeping.

But I knew the truth‚Äîand it shattered me in ways I could never have imagined.

Both my hands gripped the edge of the table beside me, desperate for something to steady myself, to pull me back to my feet. But there was nothing strong enough to hold against the relentless waves of pain crashing over me. Tears streamed down my face in an endless flow, blurring my vision.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs only fainted, just in shock,‚Äù his voice echoed in my mind, cruel and dismissive, like a taunt that refused to fade.

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt do this,‚Äù I whispered, my voice trembling, barely audible. My hand reached out towards Iona‚Äôs small, lifeless body, but I froze just before touching her. I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to face the truth‚Äîthat her delicate form was now as cold as the dark of night.

And then, the bitter realisation struck me, Nathaniel‚Äôs attention no longer belonged to his wife and child. It was now consumed by his Yoan and her son. At that moment, it became painfully clear that the marriage I had once been so proud of was nothing more than a cruel illusion, a lie I had foolishly clung to.

Nathaniel‚Äôs loyalty has always been painfully biased, and I can‚Äôt endure it any longer. My foolishness has cost me Iona, and now she‚Äôs gone forever.

Once the healer finished treating my injuries, they dressed Iona in a pristine white gown and gently placed her in a coffin. I followed as they prepared to take her to the morgue, my legs heavy with grief.

Before the burial, I planned to tell Nathaniel everything. But first, I needed to make a call.

The number I'd blocked for years, I unblocked. The monotone ring tone greeted me, once, twice, three times, then a deep voice answered.

""Angelina?""

""Hello, Alpha Malcolm... I... I've finally come to a decision about your offer.""

""You've agreed, Angie?"" The happiness in his voice made it clear he was beaming on the other end of the line.

""Yes, I had decided to return to my pack and help them with their agricultural efforts, which had been lagging. I would be leaving Nathaniel as soon as possible.""

However, as I and the few cars accompanying Iona's hearse arrived at the Black Widow Pack, Nathaniel caught up to me. His face was etched with deep sadness.

""Angie, please,"" he begged, his voice cracking with a vulnerability I'd never heard before. ""Come back to the Pearl Harbor Pack. We can fix this. I can fix it.""

I stared at him, the man I'd once loved with all my heart, and knew there was no going back. The bridge was burned, the chasm too wide.

""No way,"" I spat, the fire of my pain blazing in my chest. ""You made your choice, Nathaniel. And now, I'm making mine.""

‚Äî‚Äî

Yesterday's attack had ripped through the Pearl Harbor Pack, leaving chaos and devastation in its wake. The damage was so extensive, so profound, that none of us found peace afterward, least of all me. As Luna, I was expected to be a beacon of strength, a pillar of resilience. But how could I when I had just lost my precious four-year-old daughter, Iona?

The pain was numbing, a heavy weight pressing down on my chest. The blood loss and broken bones, the physical reminders of the attack, drained me of any tears. I was too exhausted, too shattered, to even cry.

I lay alone on our bed, staring at the blank ceiling, whispering to myself, ""That's too far.""

My whole body ached, my very soul felt bruised, but no matter how much I suffered, Nathaniel didn't seem to care. He didn't even ask about Iona. He was too busy overseeing the repairs to the pack houses and keeping Yoan company at the hospital.

Now I was starting to wonder if Nathaniel was really that busy, so busy that he could ignore me and Iona, even after Iona had passed.

I had thought that after the attack, after he'd heard about the two deep slashes I'd received and the bone fracture in my leg from the collapsing building that the enemy had set ablaze, Nathaniel would realize how much Iona and I had suffered. But I was wrong. He hadn't been home since he'd said he was going to oversee the repairs to the buildings that had been burned by the enemy.

I huddled in bed alone, feeling the excruciating pain of my wounds.

I curled up in bed, aching for the one thing I needed most: him. But what I got instead was silence.

Exhausted from the weight of it all, I fell into a restless sleep.

When I woke the next morning, the bedroom door was ajar, and for a moment, I thought I was dreaming.

But then Nathaniel walked in, towel wrapped around his waist, tapping away on his mobile as if I didn't exist.

""Nathaniel, when did you come home?"" I asked, leaning against the headboard, still feeling the lingering fatigue in my bones.

""Just now,"" he muttered without lifting his gaze.

I swallowed hard and whispered hoarsely, ""Will you be returning to the office?""

Nathaniel remained silent, not raising his head, entirely absorbed by his mobile phone. Yet, moments later, he growled harshly, ""I am the pack leader. After that attack, I must manage everything without pause, unlike you who can sleep whilst others lie critically wounded beyond our doors.""

""How dare you‚Äî""



Chapter 2

""Rather than complaining incessantly, you'd do better preparing my breakfast,"" he interrupted.

I clenched my jaw and tightened my fists. I desperately wanted to slap him repeatedly and make him understand that his daughter Iona was more than just 'critically wounded'. I wanted to make him realise he had lost his own daughter through his selfish prioritisation of Hazel, Yona's son.

I clenched my jaw, restraining the biting response that trembled on my lips.

He had been like this recently‚Äîdistant, acerbic, perpetually absent, even when physically present. So, I turned silently and made my way to the kitchen.

Even as I stirred the spaghetti I was making, my thoughts kept drifting to Yoan and his son, Hazel. Was Yoan with Nathaniel all day? Did he sleep over at Yoan's? Did he love Hazel even more than Nathaniel should love Iona? But I tried to push those feelings aside and think more positively. After breakfast was ready, Nathaniel joined me at the table but he was always on his phone.

I stayed quiet, knowing there was no point in starting a conversation. His reply would probably be short and painful.

""We've investigated the attack from the early hours, and we suspect several packs who've long been at odds with us, primarily because our pack is more prosperous than theirs,"" Nathaniel continued whilst enjoying his meal. ""I'll be home rather late today. Would you mind preparing my packed lunch as usual?""

""Yes,"" I replied with uncharacteristic indifference.

""Has Iona not awakened yet? Poor thing must be terrified and traumatised. I'll take her for a picnic next weekend,"" Nathaniel mused.

I sighed and stared at him in utter disbelief. Our daughter had been lying in the mortuary for two days, yet he remained completely oblivious to this devastating reality.

Drawing a deep breath, I murmured, ""Actually, Iona‚Äî""

Before I could explain that our daughter would never wake again, Nathaniel's mobile rang. Upon answering, his face contorted with worry, and he sprung to his feet with alarming urgency.

""Mate, could you possibly drop off that packed lunch at the office later? Something urgent's come up. Hazel's having seizures,"" Nathaniel announced.

""Nathaniel!"" I called out sharply.

""I'm terribly sorry, but this is paramount, Angie. Listen, you've recovered from your injuries, haven't you? So I really must look after Hazel and Yoan. Yoan's a widow now, and her husband was a high-ranking Theta who wielded considerable influence in the Pearl Harbor Pack.""

""Yes, I've recovered, and your daughter hasn't awakened,"" I replied with biting sarcasm, ""And perhaps never will.""

""Oh, come now, Angie. This is hardly the time for petty jealousy,"" Nathaniel grumbled.

""Yes, I know.""

""Thank you for understanding, Angie. I'll see you at the office later."" Nathaniel patted my head before grabbing his coat and departing.

In that moment, I felt like an insignificant fragment of Nathaniel's life‚Äîas I had always been. Nathaniel prioritised Yoan and Hazel above all else, whilst I remained an outsider desperately trying to breach their world.

I watched Nathaniel's car begin to pull away from the house, feeling increasingly alienated by the reality before me. Just before his final departure, a courier had arrived with a bouquet of lilies and a box of luxury chocolates. I knew, with crushing certainty, that these were gifts for Yoan and her son.

Nathaniel could be so lavish with others, yet last month's memory stabbed at my heart‚Äîwhen Iona had asked for a new doll, Nathaniel had merely tossed her a packet of cheap hair bands.

I'd always known Nathaniel desperately yearned for a son, but his treatment of Iona had been beyond cruel.

To him, Hazel might as well have been his own son‚Äîborn of a woman who‚Äôd stood by his side for years, after all. Meanwhile, my Iona is a child of his newfound choice, sprung from the womb of a wife he selected only recently. Nathaniel‚Äôs priorities will forever lie with Yoan and Hazel, never with me or my poor, overlooked girl.

Yoan‚Äôs husband, Carl, perished a year ago‚Äîhis life claimed by grievous wounds from a night hunt. Yet even in death, Carl‚Äôs devotion to Yoan remained unshakable, flawless. And now, Yoan has my husband‚ÄîNathaniel‚Äîas her closest confidant. A man who dotes on her, who would move heaven and earth for her. A loyalty I‚Äôve never been granted, though by every right, I should claim it.

Time and again, this bitterness towards Yoan and Hazel has gnawed at me. Even when I carried Iona‚Äîclinging to her as my body threatened to betray us both‚Äîit festered. Yet whenever I dared confront Nathaniel, he dismissed it as hysterics. Blind jealousy, he‚Äôd sneer, as though my anguish were some trifling melodrama.

But Nathaniel remains wilfully oblivious to the heart of it: his own daughter, who‚Äôs never known a father‚Äôs love. Half the pack whispers of it‚Äîthis unspoken truth about Iona‚Äîyet he parades his indifference like virtue. No wrongdoing here, his silence declares.

And oh, how it stings. When he lavishes Yoan with jewels fit for a queen, I receive trinkets I could pluck from the market myself. It‚Äôs not the cost, Nathaniel. It‚Äôs the care‚Äîthe absence of thought for the woman who‚Äôs sacrificed everything. For you.

Still, I dare not confront Yoan or her son. The Pearl Harbour Pack would sooner tear out my throat than see me as their Luna. Her they adore; me, they tolerate.

The microwave‚Äôs piercing beep jolts me from my misery. I busy myself packing two lunchboxes‚Äîoverstuffed, as always‚Äîthen gather laundry with mechanical haste. But my hands freeze mid-fold. His shirt. Nathaniel‚Äôs, worn last night. I press it to my face, and‚Äî

Scent of gladiol and musk. Her.

‚ÄúYoan‚Äôs,‚Äù Sky, my wolf, growls through the mindlink. No hesitation. No mercy.

The tears come then, ugly and suffocating.

He was with her. While I lay bleeding, mourning Iona‚Äôs eternal absence, he clung to her.

Every whispered promise, every ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre my only‚Äù



Chapter 3

The shirt slips from my grip as my knees buckle. All those lies, so deftly spun, and I‚Ä¶ I believed.

Every suspicion I‚Äôd stifled for years razored open, raw and brutal.

I lurched to my feet, ribs cracking under the truth‚Äîher perfume cloying his collars, the bouquet he‚Äôd never brought me, the glacial distance between us. It wasn‚Äôt suspicion anymore. It was arithmetic.

I‚Äôd always been the third.

The mobile trembled in my grip, fingers slick with fury. How many times had we rowed over Yoan? How many times had he spun my pain into pettiness, made me grovel for daring to question his ‚Äúloyalty‚Äù?

Not this time.

No more contorting myself into apologies. No more haunting my own bloody marriage.

I stabbed at the screen, dialling the number I‚Äôd ignored weeks prior‚Äîthe one cryptic offer I‚Äôd dismissed, clinging to the delusion that Nathaniel might change. That I might still matter.

‚ÄúAlpha Malcolm.‚Äù My voice was glacial, steady‚Äîa stark contrast to the fault lines fracturing my insides. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve reconsidered your‚Ä¶ proposal. I‚Äôll be transferring back to the Black Widow Pack.‚Äù

A beat of silence. Then, deliberate, as though etching the words into the air itself, ‚ÄúSoon.‚Äù

Months prior, Alpha Malcolm had presented me with a prestigious opportunity: to serve as an agricultural strategist at Black Widow Pack‚Äôs academy farm. The same academy where I had once been a prodigy‚Äîwhere I‚Äôd first crossed paths with Nathaniel, and where I‚Äôd mastered critical techniques in communal survival and sustainable leadership.

My affinity for agriculture had bloomed early. As a child, I‚Äôd nurtured an unrelenting fascination for livestock husbandry and crop cultivation‚Äîa passion that hardened into academic obsession. By sixteen, I‚Äôd drafted pioneering methodologies to optimise harvest yields; by twenty, my research licences with Black Widow Pack had earned me a formal endorsement from their Leader himself. When Nathaniel proposed five years ago, I was being groomed for a coveted role in their Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs.

Yet love loomed over me like a scythe. In the delicate calculus of devotion, I chose Nathaniel. I forfeited my ambitions, dismantled my laboratory, and vanished into the shadows of Pearl Harbor Pack as its Luna.

Two years later, Alpha Malcolm reached out once more, urging me to reclaim the role. Black Widow Pack‚Äôs harvests had failed catastrophically; they needed expertise I could provide. Yet loyalty to Nathaniel anchored me. I declined again‚Äîthough not without sending crates of our surplus grain to stave off their famine.

How could I, as Luna, abandon Pearl Harbor? My duty, I‚Äôd told myself, lay in the soil of these lands, in the pulse of this pack.

But yesterday‚Äôs ambush shattered that illusion. As Iona and I bled out on the forest floor, Nathaniel had raced to Yoan‚Äôs side first. Not mine. Not ours. My daughter‚Äôs death, my own brush with oblivion‚Äîthey were mere footnotes to him.

A Luna in title. A ghost in practice.

Why linger where my Alpha‚Äîmy husband‚Äîtreated my existence as incidental?

The decision crystallised, cold and unyielding. I dialled Alpha Malcolm‚Äôs number, voice steady. ‚ÄúI accept your offer. I‚Äôm returning to Black Widow Pack.‚Äù

‚ÄúExcellent news, Angie. Our pack‚Äôs doors remain open to you,‚Äù Alpha Malcolm replied, his voice brimming with a warmth that seemed to transcend the receiver. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll expedite the transfer documentation and forward the requisite files once prepared. Ensure your affairs here are settled‚Äîwe‚Äôll prioritise a seamless transition.‚Äù

‚ÄúThank you, Alpha Malcolm,‚Äù I said, steadying the tremor in my words. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm grateful for this chance. You‚Äôll have no cause to doubt my commitment.‚Äù

The call ended. I stood motionless, the weight of finality pressing down. There was no undoing it now, I would leave.

Yet duty lingered.

I assembled Nathaniel‚Äôs lunch‚Äîroasted pheasant, honeyed oats‚Äîand added extra portions for the labourers reconstructing the storm-ravaged eastern barracks. A habitual gesture, but today it felt ceremonial. A quiet farewell to the life I‚Äôd clung to for too long.

My thoughts drifted unbidden to my early days in Pearl Harbor Pack. I bore no hatred for this place. The pack members‚Äîgenerous, resilient souls‚Äîhad shown me nothing but kindness, despite my outsider origins.

But their warmth couldn‚Äôt mend the fractures within my own walls. If my marriage had become a hollow pantomime, if my husband‚Äôs loyalties frayed at the slightest test‚Ä¶ what solace was there in duty without devotion?

A home ought to be a sanctuary, yet for me, it had become nothing more than a vessel of solitude.

Lost in contemplation, I arrived at the Alpha's office and, as was customary, entered without requiring permission. The staff greeted me with their usual warmth as I made my way to the lounge to deposit the snacks I had prepared.

As I stood there, my mobile vibrated. An email from Alpha Malcolm appeared, containing the attached transfer documents. The reality of the situation struck me, and I resolved to print them in Nathaniel's office later.

Yet just as I prepared to leave, I caught wind of hushed gossip. I halted, my heart descending as I recognised the subject of their whispered exchange.

""You simply must have seen it,"" one pack member whispered with barely contained excitement. ""At the clinic, Alpha Nathaniel presented Yoan with flowers and the most expensive chocolates for Hazel. It was absolutely romantic.""

""Indeed? He's been terribly sweet to her. With everything Yoan's experiencing with her son after the attack, she must be utterly distraught.""

Another voice interjected, ""I wonder... if Beta Hazel is their biological child, surely our pack would grow stronger?""

""Perhaps. Some say they're already mates, you know.""

A gasp escaped my lips before I could suppress it. Surely they couldn't be serious? My chest constricted as I stood, rooted to the spot.

""What? How could they possibly be mates? Yoan already has one,"" someone questioned, their voice laden with disbelief.

""Well, I've heard Beta Yoan's husband isn't actually her fated mate. Besides, it's hardly unprecedented for Alphas and Lunas to marry without being true mates, is it?""

They spoke the truth there‚Äî



Chapter 4

Nathaniel and I weren't fated mates.

We'd met at the academy, where Nathaniel had pursued me rather determinedly. Initially, I had resisted, holding fast to my belief that I should wait for my fated mate.

But Nathaniel had been persistent, and eventually, he persuaded me. He made a solemn promise that if neither of us had found our mates by seventeen, we would marry.

And so we did. For five years, we'd shared our lives, believing we'd somehow circumvented the hand of fate.

But now, hearing their words, an overwhelming realisation descended upon me.

What if Nathaniel truly had found his mate? What if that mate was indeed Yoan?

Tears threatened to spill, but I forced them back. I simply couldn't allow them to witness my anguish.

With glacial composure, I interrupted their conversation. ""Is that true?""

The packmates recoiled, their whispers dissolving into panicked stammering. ‚ÄúLuna Angeline‚Äîwe didn‚Äôt realise you were there‚Äî‚Äù

Before I could demand answers, the lounge door crashed open. A breathless voice sliced through the silence, ‚ÄúBeta Hazel‚Äôs collapsed‚Äîcardiac failure. They‚Äôre stabilising him now.‚Äù

\*\*\*

The operating theatre was stifling, the air thick with antiseptic and dread. I leaned against the wall, numb, as Nathaniel cradled Yoan‚Äîher body racked with sobs, his hands tender on her shoulders. The scene mirrored my own torment two days prior, alone in a sterile room, absorbing the news of my daughter‚Äôs death while my husband buried himself in her bed.

Now, watching them, bitterness coiled in my throat. I forced a thin smile. No theatrics. No scenes.

As I approached, Yoan flinched. Her tear-streaked face contorted with something akin to shame, and she lurched away from Nathaniel‚Äôs hold.

‚ÄúL-Luna Angeline‚Äîforgive me,‚Äù she choked. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve‚Ä¶ been close since we were children. He was only comforting me‚Äî‚Äù

Nathaniel spoke before I could.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve nothing to apologise for, Yoan.‚Äù His hand remained on her shoulder, his tone soft‚Äîtoo soft, the kind reserved for lovers, not friends. Not in his wife‚Äôs presence.

I exhaled sharply, my resolve hardening like frost on glass.

This wasn‚Äôt the first time his devotion to her had gouged at me. But today, amidst the pack‚Äôs murmurs and the pall of loss, it carved deeper. I heard their words‚Äîhe‚Äôs grown cold toward her; their bond was never true‚Äîand still, the question gnawed, Why marry me, then? Why chain us both?

The doubt clung like a parasite. Had Nathaniel wed me as some petty retort when Yoan bonded with her husband weeks before our ceremony? I crushed the thought. Our history spanned years‚Äîlong before her entanglement. Surely his proposal hadn‚Äôt been a blade aimed at her.

Or had it?

I blinked, realising the paramedics had vanished. Only we three remained in that claustrophobic corridor, the fluorescents humming their judgment.

Yoan‚Äôs voice punctured the silence. ‚ÄúWe must uncover a treatment for Hazel. Properly this time.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll secure specialists,‚Äù Nathaniel said, decisive. ‚ÄúWhatever‚Äôs required.‚Äù

The collusion stung anew. I turned sharply, heels clicking toward the exit.

‚ÄúAngeline‚Äî‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt pause. The corridors blurred as I quickened my pace, then broke into a sprint. The woods swallowed me‚Äîancient oaks and bracken offering crude solace. Shifting mid-stride, my wolf‚Äôs paws struck the mud as rain needled the canopy.

Run. Just run.

My wolf roused, her presence a balm. Steady, she murmured. You are not prey.

Yet my human heart fractured. What am I, then?

‚ÄúSteady, Angie,‚Äù Sky murmured, her voice a low thrum in my skull. ‚ÄúQuell this rage. Nathaniel isn‚Äôt your destined bond. Remember. Your worth isn‚Äôt shackled to his gaze.‚Äù

Her counsel cooled the tempest in my chest.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right,‚Äù I panted, halting beneath a cathedral of ancient pines, my breath fogging the damp air. ‚ÄúIf Nathaniel‚Äôs free to claim his fated mate, then so are we. We deserve that.‚Äù

‚ÄúUndeniably.‚Äù

Resolve hardened like frost. I returned to the manor, scrubbed myself raw under the shower‚Äôs blistering jets, and stalked to the wardrobe. Suitcase in hand, I began folding blouses with military precision.

‚ÄúTomorrow, I depart for the Black Widow Pack,‚Äù I vowed aloud.

No more compromises. No more withering in the shadow of a man who‚Äôd mistaken my loyalty for frailty.

The door hinges whined. Nathaniel loomed in the threshold, his gaze narrowing on the half-filled suitcase.

‚ÄúExplain this.‚Äù His tone was glacial, detached‚Äîthe voice of an Alpha assessing a tactical blunder, not a husband confronting his wife‚Äôs abandonment.

‚ÄúTidying the wardrobe,‚Äù I lied, the suitcase‚Äôs weight a leaden anchor as I smoothed creases from a blouse I‚Äôd never wear again.

‚ÄúRight. I‚Äôll be accompanying Yoan to the Silver Fang Pack tomorrow,‚Äù Nathaniel announced, as though discussing a grocery list. ‚ÄúRegarding the attack.‚Äù His tone was rehearsed, lifeless. ‚ÄúWhilst you‚Äôre here‚Äîpack my charcoal suit. The Brioni one.‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course,‚Äô‚Äù I replied, toneless. My gaze remained fixed on the silk beneath my fingers‚Äîsafer than meeting the ice in his eyes.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll shower, then work late. Don‚Äôt bother with supper.‚Äù The bathroom door clicked shut.

I said nothing. Let the silence fester. Folded trousers, stacked jumpers, each movement precise. Let him work. Let him stay. Let him warm her bed until the sheets frayed. I‚Äôd long since drained my reserves of outrage.

Dawn bled through the curtains as the door groaned. Nathaniel stood silhouetted, shirt rumpled, eyes bloodshot.

‚ÄúWhy‚Äôs your case the only one packed?‚Äù His voice was sandpapered rough.

I blinked slowly. ‚ÄúMy oversight. I‚Äôll sort yours after breakfast.‚Äù

‚ÄúSee that you do.‚Äù He thrust a roll of notes at me. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a Full English in the kitchen. Prepare lunches‚Äîtwo portions. Yoan‚Äôs barely eaten since Hazel‚Äôs decline.‚Äù

I pocketed the cash. ‚ÄúNaturally.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd ensure my case is ready by noon,‚Äù he called over his shoulder. ‚Äú‚ÄòCritical meeting at the office.‚Äù

The door snapped shut behind him before I could muster a retort. I stared at the void where he‚Äôd stood‚Äîthe man who once lavished me with devotion now reduced to a spectre in his own home.

In our first year, my silences would unravel him. He‚Äôd arrive with armfuls of peonies from Covent Garden, book spontaneous weekends in the Cotswolds, his apologies whispered against my neck. Now, even my absence went unmarked.

He‚Äôs severed himself from us, Sky observed, her voice a blade sheathed in sorrow.

‚ÄúThen we owe no explanations,‚Äù I murmured, padding to the en suite. Let the scalding water purge his scent from my skin.



Chapter 5

Breakfast was ashes on my tongue. At the butcher‚Äôs, I selected cuts with methodical cruelty, ribeye for Nathaniel, venison for Yoan. A culinary send-off laced with silent venom.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll need a proper carnivorous spread,‚Äù Sky remarked, her tone laced with grim levity.

‚ÄúNaturally.‚Äù I pictured his face when he discovered the emptied wardrobes, the hollowed-out study.

On the walk back, I lingered at the training grounds. The newest recruits‚Äîpuppies, really‚Äîdrilled under the Gammas‚Äô barked orders. My chest tightened. Last time you‚Äôll play the dutiful Luna.

At the kiosk, I bought every Jammie Dodger and Penguin bar in stock. They swarmed me, all gap-toothed grins and grass-stained knees.

‚ÄúThanks a lot, Luna!‚Äù they chorused, one freckled boy clutching my sleeve. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre proper angelic, you are. Don‚Äôt let no one say otherwise!‚Äù

I knelt, smoothing his cowlick. ‚ÄúMind your Gamma. And never apologise for second helpings.‚Äù

Their praise lodged like shrapnel in my throat. ‚ÄúPersevere,‚Äù I urged, forcing a smile. Did they sense the valediction beneath my gestures? The finality?

Back in the kitchen, I assembled two tiffin carriers‚Äîone for him, one for her. Once, I‚Äôd packed twin meals for our shared lunches in his office: debating policy over Coronation chicken sandwiches, stealing crisps from his plate. Now, I was little more than a courier for his indifference.

When did the erosion begin? I wondered, arranging samosas with surgical precision. After her mate‚Äôs death? Or earlier‚Äîwhen his eyes first lingered too long on her mourning black?

The walk to his office felt surreal, as though observing a stranger enacting this pantomime of devotion. Last lunch. Last compromise. Last shred of hope discarded.

The room stood empty, stale coffee crusting a mug emblazoned with World‚Äôs Best Alpha. Predictable. His new Beta shrugged: ‚ÄúWith Beta Yoan. Her girl‚Äôs taken a turn.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll wait,‚Äù I said, tone flat.

Alone, I approached his desk. The drawer slid open with a conspiratorial whisper. Beneath requisition forms lay the pack seal‚Äîa tarnished silver wolf‚Äôs head.

Hands steady, I stamped the transfer documents Alpha Malcolm had provided. No signature required.

A shuddering breath escaped me. One copy abandoned on the desk; the other secreted in my handbag. My visa to sovereignty.

‚ÄúNow, the final‚Ä¶‚Äù My whisper died as Yoan‚Äôs voice slithered through the pack bond.

Angie, darling‚ÄîNathaniel mentioned you‚Äôre lurking in his office? Do be a love and bring lunch here. He‚Äôs ever so peckish.

Honeyed poison. My jaw clenched. The memory of last month‚Äôs ‚Äúfamily dinner‚Äù surfaced‚ÄîHazel‚Äôs pointed silence, Yoan‚Äôs saccharine pity, Iona‚Äôs trembling lower lip.

Still, this would be my final grovelling act.

‚ÄúCourse,‚Äù I bit out, boots scuffing laminate.

Yoan‚Äôs terraced house reeked of bergamot and deceit. Jeremy answered, shirt half-buttoned, trousers misaligned.

‚ÄúWho authorised this visit?‚Äù he snapped, jerking his belt buckle.

My gaze flickered past him to Yoan, swathed in a silk dressing gown. ‚ÄúInterrupting something?‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be absurd,‚Äù she purred, a Butter-wouldn‚Äôt-melt tone. ‚ÄúI insisted you come. Nathaniel, darling‚Äîstop glowering.‚Äù

Nathaniel‚Äîshoeless, collar askew‚Äîcollapsed onto her Chesterfield as if born to it.

‚ÄúDo come in, Angie,‚Äù Yoan simpered, plucking the tiffin carrier from my grip. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs make this civil.‚Äù

I trailed her through the cramped hallway, the air thick with jasmine and performative grief.

‚ÄúHow‚Äôve you been coping?‚Äù I asked, the question ash on my tongue.

She arranged her face into a mask of martyrdom. ‚ÄúOh, dreadful at first. But Carl‚Äôs sacrifice was the Moon Goddess‚Äôs design, wasn‚Äôt it? One mustn‚Äôt question divine will.‚Äù Her eyes remained arid.

Pity Carl died before learning his wife and child enjoy toying with another‚Äôs husband, I thought, spooning dal onto porcelain.

Yoan‚Äôs gaze snagged on the mating brand beneath my collar. ‚ÄúNathaniel mentioned that‚Ä¶ mark. Quaint, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù

‚ÄúA temporary brand,‚Äù I said, ladling rice with excessive care. ‚ÄúYours with Carl was genuine, of course. Mine‚Äôs merely ink.‚Äù

Her mouth tightened. As I turned to set the table, my phone trilled‚ÄîAllison.

Stepping onto the rain-slicked porch, I answered.

‚ÄúAngie‚ÄîMalcolm‚Äôs intel checks out?‚Äù My brother‚Äôs voice crackled with static and worry. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not fleeing because he‚Äôs hurt you?‚Äù

My breath hitched. ‚ÄúTransfer‚Äôs underway. How‚Äôs Mum?‚Äù

‚ÄúPining. We all are. When?‚Äù

‚ÄúTonight. Tomorrow. Soon.‚Äù

Through the window, I watched Yoan feed Nathaniel a samosa, her fingers lingering near his lips.

‚ÄúSoon,‚Äù I repeated, the word a vow.

The call disconnected. Nathaniel stood framed in the doorway, his collar still askew.

‚ÄúWho was that?‚Äù A question sharp as a papercut.

‚ÄúAllison,‚Äù I said, meeting his gaze unflinching. ‚ÄúEnquiring after my wellbeing.‚Äù

He nodded, a bureaucrat‚Äôs gesture. ‚ÄúJoin us, then.‚Äù No apology. No acknowledgement of the obscenity. Merely logistics.

The sheer banality of his presumption stole my breath. No flicker of remorse‚Äîonly the mild irritation of a man whose mistress‚Äôs lunch had gone cold.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll pass.‚Äù My smile could‚Äôve carved glass. ‚ÄúOther obligations.‚Äù

‚ÄúSuit yourself. Home later.‚Äù He turned, already halfway back to Yoan‚Äôs simpering laughter.

Not your home. Not anymore.

Drizzle stung my cheeks as I hailed a black cab. My destination is the Family Division of the High Court. Final affidavits. Dissolution of a marital contract signed in youthful delusion.

But first, a necessary detour is the hospital mortuary. A hollow-eyed clerk processed Iona‚Äôs burial permit when I presented the document embossed with Nathaniel‚Äôs seal. No condolences. No hesitation. The mortuary staff moved with unseemly haste, transferring my daughter‚Äôs precious burden to the Black Widow Pack‚Äôs morgue under cover of administrative efficiency.

As I approached the courthouse steps, uncertainty coiled cold in my chest. My hand lingered on the brass handle, the weight of finality pressing upon me. \*Was this truly the path?\*

Then it returned‚Äîthe sting of that wretched evening, the hissed taunts, the spectacle of Nathaniel and Yoan‚Äôs entwined laughter while I faded into obscurity. Their bonded status, confirmed and celebrated, had seared through the pack like a brushfire, scorching the last fragile embers of our marital pretence.

I drew a sharp breath, knuckles whitening on the doorframe.

‚ÄúLive joyfully with your mate, Nathaniel,‚Äù I hissed to the empty air.

‚ÄúAnd I shall carve my own happiness from the ashes.‚Äù

The divorce papers bore my signature in swift, ink-black strokes. At home, I arranged the documents with clinical care‚Äîtwin wedding bands gleaming dully beside them‚Äîand scrawled a note of glacial brevity, ‚ÄòKindly arrange to sign.‚Äô

When I was done, I picked up my suitcase and left. This time, leave forever.

By dusk, I was speeding north, the Pearl Harbour Pack dissolving in my rearview. Relief coursed through me, sharp and bracing, yet beneath it thrummed a wire of tension. The transfer papers in my glovebox were stamped, lawful, irrefutable‚Äîbut would border guards truly permit a Luna to slip quietly into exile?

I needn‚Äôt have doubted. News of Nathaniel‚Äôs bonded union had outpaced even my departure. The officers at the checkpoint merely inclined their heads‚Äîa gesture hovering between deference and pity‚Äîand ushered me through without a word.

Dawn found me crossing into Black Widow territory, the jagged silhouette of my old life crumbling behind me.

Fatigue had long since been incinerated by adrenaline. Twelve hours of nocturnal motorways had left me thrumming with restless purpose‚Äîto reclaim my birthright, to bury my daughter with the rites denied by Pearl Harbour‚Äôs soulless protocols.

The Black Widow‚Äôs border cut across the moor like a blade. A lean silhouette materialised from the mist, collar upturned against the dawn chill. Allison.

I braked, wheels crunching gravel. He pried open the driver‚Äôs door before I‚Äôd cut the engine.

‚ÄúWelcome home, you absolute menace,‚Äù he drawled, though his gaze darted past me to the empty backseat. ‚ÄúShift over. And where‚Äî‚Äù His voice fractured, just once. ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs the tiny terror who owes me five birthday piggybacks?‚Äù

""I‚ÄîIona..."" The words withered in my throat as my eyes fixed on the small coffin perched on the passenger seat.

Allison‚Äôs face contorted‚Äîfear, rage, desolation‚Äîas if words had abandoned her entirely.

""What‚Äôs happened, Angie?"" she whispered, brittle.

Before I could answer, Nathaniel‚Äôs voice ruptured through my mind‚Äîa mindlink frayed with terror, fury, raw and jagged as shattered glass.

""Angie! Why are you leaving?""

Divorce It Is! -  Now diving into this gripping novel, want to read with me?","My VP office had suddenly been handed over to the new female intern by my husband Ryker Hampton.  
  
Later, she even posted photos of the office on Ins with the caption:  
  
\[Grateful for my dear CEO Mr. Hampton's reward!\]  
  
In the attached photos, the entire office layout carefully designed by me had been changed, and even more all my award plaques had mysteriously vanished.  
  
I forwarded it directly to Ryker:  
  
\[What exactly are you playing at? Why is an intern occupying MY personal office?\]  
  
He sent back a voice message, with a drunken tone: ""Babe, it's just an office. You're not using it anyway.""  
  
\[You have ten minutes to restore my office to its original condition.\]  
  
On the other end, Ryker didn't respond.  
  
Two minutes later, Hampton Industries' most critical contract was forcibly terminated.  
  
Since someone wanted to challenge my authority, I didn't mind letting Hampton Industries go BANKRUPT directly.  
  
\---  
  
The calls from Ryker kept pouring in, one after another. I didn't answer until the fifth one.  
  
His furious voice erupted through the speaker.  
  
""Mila! Have you lost your damn mind? That was a two hundred million dollar project!""  
  
""You know perfectly well the product launch is next week. Pulling the plug now is practically corporate suicide!""  
  
""All this over only an office? Are you serious?""  
  
Five years of marriage, and this was the first time he'd ever raised his voice at me over another woman.  
  
I took a small sip of my warm coffee, feeling the heat slide down my throat while my heart turned to ice.  
  
""Dead serious,"" I replied coolly.  
  
""Ryker, restore my office to exactly how it was before. Every single award, every item in its precise location. Otherwise, your company will suffer far greater losses.""  
  
On the other end, Ryker fell silent for several seconds.  
  
""You have five minutes. Starting now.""  
  
I delivered these words with cold precision before directly hanging up.  
  
Two minutes later, he sent photos of my restored office. Everything had been returned to its original place.  
  
Upon receiving the pictures, I immediately contacted the project manager and rescinded the termination order.  
  
But I sent Ryker a photo in return.  
  
In the image, his study had been completely emptied.  
  
Including his most prized possession‚Äîan expensive antique he'd just acquired at auction.  
  
I attached a second photo: the antique shattered into pieces across the floor.  
  
""Ryker, this is your punishment. You know my temperament. Don't let this happen again.""  
  
There was no response from his end.  
  
I knew he was furious. But I was even more so.  
  
Our marriage began as a strategic alliance between two corporations.  
  
Five years ago, he needed Sullivan Enterprises' overseas distribution channels, and I needed Hampton Industries' domestic manufacturing facilities. A business marriage was the logical conclusion.  
  
No passionate love story‚Äîjust a rational choice for mutual benefit.  
  
""Mila, we'll not only support each other in business, but after marriage, I promise to trust and respect you,"" Ryker had said, holding my hands, his gaze steady and sincere before our wedding.  
  
""I appreciate your honesty, Mr. Hampton. I hope our partnership proves fruitful,"" I'd responded with a measured smile.  
  
Over five years, we evolved from strangers to confidants, from respect to dependence, then to genuine warmth and affection.  
  
We'd shared countless nights huddled together after exhausting business functions.  
  
This year, we finally welcomed our baby.  
  
It was the perfect testament to our love, making me believe our love bond was unbreakable.  
  
But now, Brianna's appearance had shattered all the trust and understanding we'd built.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
Ryker didn't come home that night.  
  
I knew he was expressing his anger and dissatisfaction through his absence.  
  
The next day, I left our son with the nanny and went straight to the office.  
  
The employees looked surprised when they saw me, quickly lowering their heads and greeting me respectfully.  
  
""Ms. Sullivan! Your postpartum recovery period isn't over yet. Should you be at home and have rest?"" the young receptionist asked with concern.  
  
""Just checking on things,"" I replied with a slight nod before heading straight to the executive floor.  
  
As the elevator doors opened, I heard laughter coming from Ryker's office.  
  
Through the half-open door, I saw Brianna sitting beside him.  
  
Ryker's eyes sparkled with amusement‚Äîa stark contrast to the cool demeanor he typically maintained with other assistants.  
  
Usually, except for me, he never allowed anyone to linger in his office, much less with such a tender expression on his face.  
  
But now, he was sitting incredibly close to Brianna, the two of them deep in animated conversation.  
  
Brianna was wearing a high-end designer outfit.  
  
The exact one I had been eyeing‚Äîthe one Ryker had promised to get for me.  
  
Not just expensive, it was a limited edition‚Äîonly five sets existed worldwide.  
  
And now it was on an female intern.  
  
I pushed the door open. Their laughter died instantly.  
  
The smile froze on Ryker's face.  
  
""What are you doing here?"" he asked.  
  
Brianna quickly stood up, plastering a respectful expression on her face while greeting me in a honeyed voice.  
  
""Ms. Sullivan! I heard you just had your baby. They say pregnancy changes a woman's figure, but wow, you've bounced back amazingly!""  
  
I scoffed, firing back: ""Since when is my figure any of your business? Which blind idiot hired someone with such poor manners?""  
  
Brianna's smile stiffened, her fingers fidgeting nervously.  
  
""Take off that outfit. Now.""  
  
The atmosphere in the office plummeted to sub-zero.  
  
Brianna's eyes widened, her lips trembling in disbelief.  
  
She turned to Ryker with a doe-eyed, tearful look of appeal.  
  
I also turned to Ryker, my gaze cold as ice.  
  
""Explain why MY clothes are on HER body.""  
  
Heard of that, Ryker's brow furrowed in irritation.  
  
""After yesterday's office incident, Brianna became the subject of office gossip. I was simply compensating her.""  
  
""It's just an outfit. I'll get you something better later.""  
  
""Compensation?"" I let out a cold laugh. ""This outfit might not be much to us, but it's still a globally limited edition haute couture piece. Who the hell is Brianna to wear something like this?""  
  
""Besides, yesterday's situation was her own fault for not knowing her place.""  
  
""Ryker, have you forgotten your position? Forgotten who I am? Who gave you permission to hand out my things?!""  
  
By the time I finished, Brianna was pale with fear, teary-eyed as she stammered:  
  
""I'm sorry, Ms. Sullivan, I didn't know it was yours...""  
  
""Now you do. Take it off immediately.""  
  
Seeing me cut Brianna off and refusing to back down, Ryker lost his patience.  
  
""Mila! Enough! We have a project meeting to get to. Stop making a scene!""  
  
My heart sank.  
  
He had never raised his voice at me in the office before, but now he was breaking that rule for Brianna.  
  
Beside him, Brianna visibly relaxed when she saw Ryker standing up for her.  
  
""Project? Which project?""  
  
""The collaboration with Grant Corp. Brianna and I were just about to leave.""  
  
Ryker adjusted his tie, his tone increasingly impatient.  
  
""Ms. Winters has been instrumental in this deal, so I'm taking her along for the negotiation.""  
  
I raised an eyebrow, my smile dripping with sarcasm. ""Oh? I wasn't aware an intern had such influence that she could sway public company decisions now.""  
  
Ryker's face darkened as he grabbed his briefcase and gestured for Brianna to follow.  
  
""Let's go. We're wasting time.""  
  
As they brushed past me, Brianna flashed me a smug smile, her eyes full of challenge.  
  
Well, Ryker, you brought this on yourself.  
  
Since you insist on defending Brianna, don't blame me for what comes next.  
  
After they left, I pulled out my phone and dialed the private number of Grant Corp's chairman.  
  
""Chairman Willis? This is Mila.""  
  
""About that collaboration Ryker is discussing today...""  
  
Chapter 3  
  
An hour later, Ryker called.  
  
He was absolutely livid, his voice thundering through the phone.  
  
""What the actual fuck, Mila?!""  
  
""Chairman Willis just publicly destroyed Brianna‚Äîcalled her my side piece, accused her of sleeping her way up the corporate ladder!""  
  
""Then he had the nerve to tell everyone that Sullivan Enterprises was built on YOUR back, and that I'm some ungrateful piece of shit taking advantage while you're on maternity leave to chase skirts! Said I forgot who put me where I am!""  
  
""You set this whole thing up, didn't you?!""  
  
I let out a cold laugh. ""Listen carefully, Ryker. I don't control what people think or say. The truth has a way of speaking for itself, and clearly others can see what you can't.""  
  
""Brianna left a sobbing mess, and the deal's dead. Happy now?""  
  
""Damn right I am. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.""  
  
After hanging up, the white-hot rage inside me cooled to a simmer.  
  
Later, my assistant Josh messaged that the Brianna's drama had spread like wildfire through the company.  
  
When she returned to the office, people were openly gossiping, pointing, whispering.  
  
Some colleagues didn't even bother to lower their voices as they called her an ambitious little snake with no talent who was trying to screw her way to the top.  
  
Everything on her desk had been dumped unceremoniously into the trash.  
  
Even as she broke down crying, blubbering ""You've got it all wrong"" and ""This isn't fair""‚Äînobody gave a shit about her excuses.  
  
Who in their right mind would side with an intern over a VP?  
  
Everyone piled on like vultures on roadkill.  
  
I'd seen this scenario play out a thousand times before. Brianna was just reaping the hurricane she'd sown.  
  
A nobody intern with zero connections or remarkable talent, thinking she could leapfrog to the executive floor with a few batted eyelashes? Please.  
  
Completely humiliated, Brianna handed in her resignation.  
  
Since she hadn't even completed proper onboarding, HR didn't waste a second before stamping ""APPROVED.""  
  
Brianna brought this entirely on herself. That's what happens when she was delusional enough to think she can steal someone else's husband and position.  
  
And Ryker? He managed to smooth things over with Grant Corp after their dinner.  
  
But after he discovered Brianna had left the company, his face turned darker than a thundercloud.  
  
When he came home that night, I was softly humming a lullaby to our son.  
  
Our little boy's chubby face‚Äîwith Ryker's nose and eyes perfectly copied onto his tiny features‚Äîwas peaceful in sleep.  
  
Ryker stood in the nursery doorway, his expression murderous despite deliberately keeping his voice down.  
  
""Brianna did absolutely nothing wrong. She was just a hardworking girl, and now because of your jealous power trip, she's lost her job AND her reputation!""  
  
""Jesus Christ, Mila, even your rich-bitch tantrums should have some goddamn limits!""  
  
I shot him a look that could freeze hell and signaled him to shut the fuck up as I gently placed our sleeping child in his crib.  
  
Only after walking out and slamming the door behind us did I unleash.  
  
""Let me make myself crystal clear, Ryker. I didn't order your precious Brianna to be bullied or fired.""  
  
Despite telling myself I shouldn't care, the raw distrust in his eyes still cut like a knife.  
  
""Be honest with yourself for once‚Äîhow many exceptions did you make for that girl? How many rules did you break?""  
  
""It was YOUR permissiveness, YOUR special treatment that gave her the idea she could aim for what's didn't belong to her.""  
  
""There is nothing between me and Brianna!"" Ryker fired back, veins popping in his neck.  
  
""Bullshit! Then why give her MY clothes? Why let her set up camp in your office like she owns the place?""  
  
""Your last assistant couldn't even bring a fucking chair into your office without you having a conniption fit.""  
  
""Yet for Brianna, you break rules left and right. You even glare at me‚Äîyour wife who just gave birth to your child‚Äîall for her sake!""  
  
I lifted my chin slightly, looking directly into Ryker's eyes, each word deliberate.  
  
""Let me spell it out for you, Ryker. Yes, I care about you. Otherwise, I wouldn't have married you or carried your child.""  
  
""But you know damn well I don't tolerate even a hint of betrayal or deception. Not now, not ever.""  
  
""If you dare cross that line‚Äîeven just with your eyes or your thoughts‚ÄîI won't hesitate for a second to find my son a father who knows how to respect his wife!""  
  
Ryker's face turned ashen as he spun around and stormed toward the guest bedroom.  
  
But I knew this storm would passed.  
  
After cooling off in the guest room, we'd reconcile tomorrow. Reset. Move forward.  
  
This had been our pattern throughout five years of marriage.  
  
The difference was that our previous conflicts had always been about business or household matters.  
  
Fighting over another woman? This was the first time.  
  
And I would make damn sure it was the last.

‚ÄúLuna, I‚Äôm deeply sorry for your loss. Iona‚Äôs passing is truly heartbreaking. I can‚Äôt imagine how it must feel to lose such a little angel,‚Äù the healer said as he approached me, fresh from the examination room. The moment those words left his mouth, my legs gave way, and I sank to the floor.

I couldn‚Äôt believe it‚Äîthe very first thing he told me was such devastating news. It felt like my entire world crumbled in an instant. Iona was only four years old, and her fifth birthday was just weeks away.

The attack that happened in the early hours of this morning turned everything upside down, shattering everything I‚Äôd worked so hard to protect for so long. It was chaos, pure and utter chaos, and now the cost was far greater than I could have ever imagined.

The most painful part of all this suffering was when Nathaniel ignored me as I lay helpless on the ground with Iona, both of us barely clinging to life while trying to escape. He was too preoccupied helping Yoan and her son, Dane.

Yoan and Nathaniel had been childhood friends, their bond running deep long before Nathaniel even met me.

When he found me gravely injured and Iona unconscious, trapped beneath the rubble of the packhouse, he chose to turn away. He merely called for members of the Pack Medical Centre before focusing his attention elsewhere.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs only fainted and in shock, Yoan. Let‚Äôs check on your son first‚Äîhe‚Äôs in worse condition,‚Äù he had said at the time.

Nathaniel‚Äôs words still ring in my ears, their indifference cutting deeper than the wounds on my body. To him, Iona was simply unconscious, nothing to worry about. But now, as she lies lifeless before me, I can‚Äôt understand how he could've dismissed her so easily.

I sat sobbing in the corner of the room, my body trembling, utterly drained of strength. It felt as though every ounce of energy I once had had vanished, leaving me as nothing more than an empty shell. Iona‚Äôs small body lay motionless on the bed, her once-cheerful face now eerily serene, as though she were merely sleeping.

But I knew the truth‚Äîand it shattered me in ways I could never have imagined.

Both my hands gripped the edge of the table beside me, desperate for something to steady myself, to pull me back to my feet. But there was nothing strong enough to hold against the relentless waves of pain crashing over me. Tears streamed down my face in an endless flow, blurring my vision.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs only fainted, just in shock,‚Äù his voice echoed in my mind, cruel and dismissive, like a taunt that refused to fade.

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt do this,‚Äù I whispered, my voice trembling, barely audible. My hand reached out towards Iona‚Äôs small, lifeless body, but I froze just before touching her. I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to face the truth‚Äîthat her delicate form was now as cold as the dark of night.

And then, the bitter realisation struck me, Nathaniel‚Äôs attention no longer belonged to his wife and child. It was now consumed by his Yoan and her son. At that moment, it became painfully clear that the marriage I had once been so proud of was nothing more than a cruel illusion, a lie I had foolishly clung to.

Nathaniel‚Äôs loyalty has always been painfully biased, and I can‚Äôt endure it any longer. My foolishness has cost me Iona, and now she‚Äôs gone forever.

Once the healer finished treating my injuries, they dressed Iona in a pristine white gown and gently placed her in a coffin. I followed as they prepared to take her to the morgue, my legs heavy with grief.

Before the burial, I planned to tell Nathaniel everything. But first, I needed to make a call.

The number I'd blocked for years, I unblocked. The monotone ring tone greeted me, once, twice, three times, then a deep voice answered.

""Angelina?""

""Hello, Alpha Malcolm... I... I've finally come to a decision about your offer.""

""You've agreed, Angie?"" The happiness in his voice made it clear he was beaming on the other end of the line.

""Yes, I had decided to return to my pack and help them with their agricultural efforts, which had been lagging. I would be leaving Nathaniel as soon as possible.""

However, as I and the few cars accompanying Iona's hearse arrived at the Black Widow Pack, Nathaniel caught up to me. His face was etched with deep sadness.

""Angie, please,"" he begged, his voice cracking with a vulnerability I'd never heard before. ""Come back to the Pearl Harbor Pack. We can fix this. I can fix it.""

I stared at him, the man I'd once loved with all my heart, and knew there was no going back. The bridge was burned, the chasm too wide.

""No way,"" I spat, the fire of my pain blazing in my chest. ""You made your choice, Nathaniel. And now, I'm making mine.""

‚Äî‚Äî

Yesterday's attack had ripped through the Pearl Harbor Pack, leaving chaos and devastation in its wake. The damage was so extensive, so profound, that none of us found peace afterward, least of all me. As Luna, I was expected to be a beacon of strength, a pillar of resilience. But how could I when I had just lost my precious four-year-old daughter, Iona?

The pain was numbing, a heavy weight pressing down on my chest. The blood loss and broken bones, the physical reminders of the attack, drained me of any tears. I was too exhausted, too shattered, to even cry.

I lay alone on our bed, staring at the blank ceiling, whispering to myself, ""That's too far.""

My whole body ached, my very soul felt bruised, but no matter how much I suffered, Nathaniel didn't seem to care. He didn't even ask about Iona. He was too busy overseeing the repairs to the pack houses and keeping Yoan company at the hospital.

Now I was starting to wonder if Nathaniel was really that busy, so busy that he could ignore me and Iona, even after Iona had passed.

I had thought that after the attack, after he'd heard about the two deep slashes I'd received and the bone fracture in my leg from the collapsing building that the enemy had set ablaze, Nathaniel would realize how much Iona and I had suffered. But I was wrong. He hadn't been home since he'd said he was going to oversee the repairs to the buildings that had been burned by the enemy.

I huddled in bed alone, feeling the excruciating pain of my wounds.

I curled up in bed, aching for the one thing I needed most: him. But what I got instead was silence.

Exhausted from the weight of it all, I fell into a restless sleep.

When I woke the next morning, the bedroom door was ajar, and for a moment, I thought I was dreaming.

But then Nathaniel walked in, towel wrapped around his waist, tapping away on his mobile as if I didn't exist.

""Nathaniel, when did you come home?"" I asked, leaning against the headboard, still feeling the lingering fatigue in my bones.

""Just now,"" he muttered without lifting his gaze.

I swallowed hard and whispered hoarsely, ""Will you be returning to the office?""

Nathaniel remained silent, not raising his head, entirely absorbed by his mobile phone. Yet, moments later, he growled harshly, ""I am the pack leader. After that attack, I must manage everything without pause, unlike you who can sleep whilst others lie critically wounded beyond our doors.""

""How dare you‚Äî""



Chapter 2

""Rather than complaining incessantly, you'd do better preparing my breakfast,"" he interrupted.

I clenched my jaw and tightened my fists. I desperately wanted to slap him repeatedly and make him understand that his daughter Iona was more than just 'critically wounded'. I wanted to make him realise he had lost his own daughter through his selfish prioritisation of Hazel, Yona's son.

I clenched my jaw, restraining the biting response that trembled on my lips.

He had been like this recently‚Äîdistant, acerbic, perpetually absent, even when physically present. So, I turned silently and made my way to the kitchen.

Even as I stirred the spaghetti I was making, my thoughts kept drifting to Yoan and his son, Hazel. Was Yoan with Nathaniel all day? Did he sleep over at Yoan's? Did he love Hazel even more than Nathaniel should love Iona? But I tried to push those feelings aside and think more positively. After breakfast was ready, Nathaniel joined me at the table but he was always on his phone.

I stayed quiet, knowing there was no point in starting a conversation. His reply would probably be short and painful.

""We've investigated the attack from the early hours, and we suspect several packs who've long been at odds with us, primarily because our pack is more prosperous than theirs,"" Nathaniel continued whilst enjoying his meal. ""I'll be home rather late today. Would you mind preparing my packed lunch as usual?""

""Yes,"" I replied with uncharacteristic indifference.

""Has Iona not awakened yet? Poor thing must be terrified and traumatised. I'll take her for a picnic next weekend,"" Nathaniel mused.

I sighed and stared at him in utter disbelief. Our daughter had been lying in the mortuary for two days, yet he remained completely oblivious to this devastating reality.

Drawing a deep breath, I murmured, ""Actually, Iona‚Äî""

Before I could explain that our daughter would never wake again, Nathaniel's mobile rang. Upon answering, his face contorted with worry, and he sprung to his feet with alarming urgency.

""Mate, could you possibly drop off that packed lunch at the office later? Something urgent's come up. Hazel's having seizures,"" Nathaniel announced.

""Nathaniel!"" I called out sharply.

""I'm terribly sorry, but this is paramount, Angie. Listen, you've recovered from your injuries, haven't you? So I really must look after Hazel and Yoan. Yoan's a widow now, and her husband was a high-ranking Theta who wielded considerable influence in the Pearl Harbor Pack.""

""Yes, I've recovered, and your daughter hasn't awakened,"" I replied with biting sarcasm, ""And perhaps never will.""

""Oh, come now, Angie. This is hardly the time for petty jealousy,"" Nathaniel grumbled.

""Yes, I know.""

""Thank you for understanding, Angie. I'll see you at the office later."" Nathaniel patted my head before grabbing his coat and departing.

In that moment, I felt like an insignificant fragment of Nathaniel's life‚Äîas I had always been. Nathaniel prioritised Yoan and Hazel above all else, whilst I remained an outsider desperately trying to breach their world.

I watched Nathaniel's car begin to pull away from the house, feeling increasingly alienated by the reality before me. Just before his final departure, a courier had arrived with a bouquet of lilies and a box of luxury chocolates. I knew, with crushing certainty, that these were gifts for Yoan and her son.

Nathaniel could be so lavish with others, yet last month's memory stabbed at my heart‚Äîwhen Iona had asked for a new doll, Nathaniel had merely tossed her a packet of cheap hair bands.

I'd always known Nathaniel desperately yearned for a son, but his treatment of Iona had been beyond cruel.

To him, Hazel might as well have been his own son‚Äîborn of a woman who‚Äôd stood by his side for years, after all. Meanwhile, my Iona is a child of his newfound choice, sprung from the womb of a wife he selected only recently. Nathaniel‚Äôs priorities will forever lie with Yoan and Hazel, never with me or my poor, overlooked girl.

Yoan‚Äôs husband, Carl, perished a year ago‚Äîhis life claimed by grievous wounds from a night hunt. Yet even in death, Carl‚Äôs devotion to Yoan remained unshakable, flawless. And now, Yoan has my husband‚ÄîNathaniel‚Äîas her closest confidant. A man who dotes on her, who would move heaven and earth for her. A loyalty I‚Äôve never been granted, though by every right, I should claim it.

Time and again, this bitterness towards Yoan and Hazel has gnawed at me. Even when I carried Iona‚Äîclinging to her as my body threatened to betray us both‚Äîit festered. Yet whenever I dared confront Nathaniel, he dismissed it as hysterics. Blind jealousy, he‚Äôd sneer, as though my anguish were some trifling melodrama.

But Nathaniel remains wilfully oblivious to the heart of it: his own daughter, who‚Äôs never known a father‚Äôs love. Half the pack whispers of it‚Äîthis unspoken truth about Iona‚Äîyet he parades his indifference like virtue. No wrongdoing here, his silence declares.

And oh, how it stings. When he lavishes Yoan with jewels fit for a queen, I receive trinkets I could pluck from the market myself. It‚Äôs not the cost, Nathaniel. It‚Äôs the care‚Äîthe absence of thought for the woman who‚Äôs sacrificed everything. For you.

Still, I dare not confront Yoan or her son. The Pearl Harbour Pack would sooner tear out my throat than see me as their Luna. Her they adore; me, they tolerate.

The microwave‚Äôs piercing beep jolts me from my misery. I busy myself packing two lunchboxes‚Äîoverstuffed, as always‚Äîthen gather laundry with mechanical haste. But my hands freeze mid-fold. His shirt. Nathaniel‚Äôs, worn last night. I press it to my face, and‚Äî

Scent of gladiol and musk. Her.

‚ÄúYoan‚Äôs,‚Äù Sky, my wolf, growls through the mindlink. No hesitation. No mercy.

The tears come then, ugly and suffocating.

He was with her. While I lay bleeding, mourning Iona‚Äôs eternal absence, he clung to her.

Every whispered promise, every ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre my only‚Äù



Chapter 3

The shirt slips from my grip as my knees buckle. All those lies, so deftly spun, and I‚Ä¶ I believed.

Every suspicion I‚Äôd stifled for years razored open, raw and brutal.

I lurched to my feet, ribs cracking under the truth‚Äîher perfume cloying his collars, the bouquet he‚Äôd never brought me, the glacial distance between us. It wasn‚Äôt suspicion anymore. It was arithmetic.

I‚Äôd always been the third.

The mobile trembled in my grip, fingers slick with fury. How many times had we rowed over Yoan? How many times had he spun my pain into pettiness, made me grovel for daring to question his ‚Äúloyalty‚Äù?

Not this time.

No more contorting myself into apologies. No more haunting my own bloody marriage.

I stabbed at the screen, dialling the number I‚Äôd ignored weeks prior‚Äîthe one cryptic offer I‚Äôd dismissed, clinging to the delusion that Nathaniel might change. That I might still matter.

‚ÄúAlpha Malcolm.‚Äù My voice was glacial, steady‚Äîa stark contrast to the fault lines fracturing my insides. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve reconsidered your‚Ä¶ proposal. I‚Äôll be transferring back to the Black Widow Pack.‚Äù

A beat of silence. Then, deliberate, as though etching the words into the air itself, ‚ÄúSoon.‚Äù

Months prior, Alpha Malcolm had presented me with a prestigious opportunity: to serve as an agricultural strategist at Black Widow Pack‚Äôs academy farm. The same academy where I had once been a prodigy‚Äîwhere I‚Äôd first crossed paths with Nathaniel, and where I‚Äôd mastered critical techniques in communal survival and sustainable leadership.

My affinity for agriculture had bloomed early. As a child, I‚Äôd nurtured an unrelenting fascination for livestock husbandry and crop cultivation‚Äîa passion that hardened into academic obsession. By sixteen, I‚Äôd drafted pioneering methodologies to optimise harvest yields; by twenty, my research licences with Black Widow Pack had earned me a formal endorsement from their Leader himself. When Nathaniel proposed five years ago, I was being groomed for a coveted role in their Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs.

Yet love loomed over me like a scythe. In the delicate calculus of devotion, I chose Nathaniel. I forfeited my ambitions, dismantled my laboratory, and vanished into the shadows of Pearl Harbor Pack as its Luna.

Two years later, Alpha Malcolm reached out once more, urging me to reclaim the role. Black Widow Pack‚Äôs harvests had failed catastrophically; they needed expertise I could provide. Yet loyalty to Nathaniel anchored me. I declined again‚Äîthough not without sending crates of our surplus grain to stave off their famine.

How could I, as Luna, abandon Pearl Harbor? My duty, I‚Äôd told myself, lay in the soil of these lands, in the pulse of this pack.

But yesterday‚Äôs ambush shattered that illusion. As Iona and I bled out on the forest floor, Nathaniel had raced to Yoan‚Äôs side first. Not mine. Not ours. My daughter‚Äôs death, my own brush with oblivion‚Äîthey were mere footnotes to him.

A Luna in title. A ghost in practice.

Why linger where my Alpha‚Äîmy husband‚Äîtreated my existence as incidental?

The decision crystallised, cold and unyielding. I dialled Alpha Malcolm‚Äôs number, voice steady. ‚ÄúI accept your offer. I‚Äôm returning to Black Widow Pack.‚Äù

‚ÄúExcellent news, Angie. Our pack‚Äôs doors remain open to you,‚Äù Alpha Malcolm replied, his voice brimming with a warmth that seemed to transcend the receiver. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll expedite the transfer documentation and forward the requisite files once prepared. Ensure your affairs here are settled‚Äîwe‚Äôll prioritise a seamless transition.‚Äù

‚ÄúThank you, Alpha Malcolm,‚Äù I said, steadying the tremor in my words. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm grateful for this chance. You‚Äôll have no cause to doubt my commitment.‚Äù

The call ended. I stood motionless, the weight of finality pressing down. There was no undoing it now, I would leave.

Yet duty lingered.

I assembled Nathaniel‚Äôs lunch‚Äîroasted pheasant, honeyed oats‚Äîand added extra portions for the labourers reconstructing the storm-ravaged eastern barracks. A habitual gesture, but today it felt ceremonial. A quiet farewell to the life I‚Äôd clung to for too long.

My thoughts drifted unbidden to my early days in Pearl Harbor Pack. I bore no hatred for this place. The pack members‚Äîgenerous, resilient souls‚Äîhad shown me nothing but kindness, despite my outsider origins.

But their warmth couldn‚Äôt mend the fractures within my own walls. If my marriage had become a hollow pantomime, if my husband‚Äôs loyalties frayed at the slightest test‚Ä¶ what solace was there in duty without devotion?

A home ought to be a sanctuary, yet for me, it had become nothing more than a vessel of solitude.

Lost in contemplation, I arrived at the Alpha's office and, as was customary, entered without requiring permission. The staff greeted me with their usual warmth as I made my way to the lounge to deposit the snacks I had prepared.

As I stood there, my mobile vibrated. An email from Alpha Malcolm appeared, containing the attached transfer documents. The reality of the situation struck me, and I resolved to print them in Nathaniel's office later.

Yet just as I prepared to leave, I caught wind of hushed gossip. I halted, my heart descending as I recognised the subject of their whispered exchange.

""You simply must have seen it,"" one pack member whispered with barely contained excitement. ""At the clinic, Alpha Nathaniel presented Yoan with flowers and the most expensive chocolates for Hazel. It was absolutely romantic.""

""Indeed? He's been terribly sweet to her. With everything Yoan's experiencing with her son after the attack, she must be utterly distraught.""

Another voice interjected, ""I wonder... if Beta Hazel is their biological child, surely our pack would grow stronger?""

""Perhaps. Some say they're already mates, you know.""

A gasp escaped my lips before I could suppress it. Surely they couldn't be serious? My chest constricted as I stood, rooted to the spot.

""What? How could they possibly be mates? Yoan already has one,"" someone questioned, their voice laden with disbelief.

""Well, I've heard Beta Yoan's husband isn't actually her fated mate. Besides, it's hardly unprecedented for Alphas and Lunas to marry without being true mates, is it?""

They spoke the truth there‚Äî



Chapter 4

Nathaniel and I weren't fated mates.

We'd met at the academy, where Nathaniel had pursued me rather determinedly. Initially, I had resisted, holding fast to my belief that I should wait for my fated mate.

But Nathaniel had been persistent, and eventually, he persuaded me. He made a solemn promise that if neither of us had found our mates by seventeen, we would marry.

And so we did. For five years, we'd shared our lives, believing we'd somehow circumvented the hand of fate.

But now, hearing their words, an overwhelming realisation descended upon me.

What if Nathaniel truly had found his mate? What if that mate was indeed Yoan?

Tears threatened to spill, but I forced them back. I simply couldn't allow them to witness my anguish.

With glacial composure, I interrupted their conversation. ""Is that true?""

The packmates recoiled, their whispers dissolving into panicked stammering. ‚ÄúLuna Angeline‚Äîwe didn‚Äôt realise you were there‚Äî‚Äù

Before I could demand answers, the lounge door crashed open. A breathless voice sliced through the silence, ‚ÄúBeta Hazel‚Äôs collapsed‚Äîcardiac failure. They‚Äôre stabilising him now.‚Äù

\*\*\*

The operating theatre was stifling, the air thick with antiseptic and dread. I leaned against the wall, numb, as Nathaniel cradled Yoan‚Äîher body racked with sobs, his hands tender on her shoulders. The scene mirrored my own torment two days prior, alone in a sterile room, absorbing the news of my daughter‚Äôs death while my husband buried himself in her bed.

Now, watching them, bitterness coiled in my throat. I forced a thin smile. No theatrics. No scenes.

As I approached, Yoan flinched. Her tear-streaked face contorted with something akin to shame, and she lurched away from Nathaniel‚Äôs hold.

‚ÄúL-Luna Angeline‚Äîforgive me,‚Äù she choked. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve‚Ä¶ been close since we were children. He was only comforting me‚Äî‚Äù

Nathaniel spoke before I could.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve nothing to apologise for, Yoan.‚Äù His hand remained on her shoulder, his tone soft‚Äîtoo soft, the kind reserved for lovers, not friends. Not in his wife‚Äôs presence.

I exhaled sharply, my resolve hardening like frost on glass.

This wasn‚Äôt the first time his devotion to her had gouged at me. But today, amidst the pack‚Äôs murmurs and the pall of loss, it carved deeper. I heard their words‚Äîhe‚Äôs grown cold toward her; their bond was never true‚Äîand still, the question gnawed, Why marry me, then? Why chain us both?

The doubt clung like a parasite. Had Nathaniel wed me as some petty retort when Yoan bonded with her husband weeks before our ceremony? I crushed the thought. Our history spanned years‚Äîlong before her entanglement. Surely his proposal hadn‚Äôt been a blade aimed at her.

Or had it?

I blinked, realising the paramedics had vanished. Only we three remained in that claustrophobic corridor, the fluorescents humming their judgment.

Yoan‚Äôs voice punctured the silence. ‚ÄúWe must uncover a treatment for Hazel. Properly this time.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll secure specialists,‚Äù Nathaniel said, decisive. ‚ÄúWhatever‚Äôs required.‚Äù

The collusion stung anew. I turned sharply, heels clicking toward the exit.

‚ÄúAngeline‚Äî‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt pause. The corridors blurred as I quickened my pace, then broke into a sprint. The woods swallowed me‚Äîancient oaks and bracken offering crude solace. Shifting mid-stride, my wolf‚Äôs paws struck the mud as rain needled the canopy.

Run. Just run.

My wolf roused, her presence a balm. Steady, she murmured. You are not prey.

Yet my human heart fractured. What am I, then?

‚ÄúSteady, Angie,‚Äù Sky murmured, her voice a low thrum in my skull. ‚ÄúQuell this rage. Nathaniel isn‚Äôt your destined bond. Remember. Your worth isn‚Äôt shackled to his gaze.‚Äù

Her counsel cooled the tempest in my chest.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right,‚Äù I panted, halting beneath a cathedral of ancient pines, my breath fogging the damp air. ‚ÄúIf Nathaniel‚Äôs free to claim his fated mate, then so are we. We deserve that.‚Äù

‚ÄúUndeniably.‚Äù

Resolve hardened like frost. I returned to the manor, scrubbed myself raw under the shower‚Äôs blistering jets, and stalked to the wardrobe. Suitcase in hand, I began folding blouses with military precision.

‚ÄúTomorrow, I depart for the Black Widow Pack,‚Äù I vowed aloud.

No more compromises. No more withering in the shadow of a man who‚Äôd mistaken my loyalty for frailty.

The door hinges whined. Nathaniel loomed in the threshold, his gaze narrowing on the half-filled suitcase.

‚ÄúExplain this.‚Äù His tone was glacial, detached‚Äîthe voice of an Alpha assessing a tactical blunder, not a husband confronting his wife‚Äôs abandonment.

‚ÄúTidying the wardrobe,‚Äù I lied, the suitcase‚Äôs weight a leaden anchor as I smoothed creases from a blouse I‚Äôd never wear again.

‚ÄúRight. I‚Äôll be accompanying Yoan to the Silver Fang Pack tomorrow,‚Äù Nathaniel announced, as though discussing a grocery list. ‚ÄúRegarding the attack.‚Äù His tone was rehearsed, lifeless. ‚ÄúWhilst you‚Äôre here‚Äîpack my charcoal suit. The Brioni one.‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course,‚Äô‚Äù I replied, toneless. My gaze remained fixed on the silk beneath my fingers‚Äîsafer than meeting the ice in his eyes.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll shower, then work late. Don‚Äôt bother with supper.‚Äù The bathroom door clicked shut.

I said nothing. Let the silence fester. Folded trousers, stacked jumpers, each movement precise. Let him work. Let him stay. Let him warm her bed until the sheets frayed. I‚Äôd long since drained my reserves of outrage.

Dawn bled through the curtains as the door groaned. Nathaniel stood silhouetted, shirt rumpled, eyes bloodshot.

‚ÄúWhy‚Äôs your case the only one packed?‚Äù His voice was sandpapered rough.

I blinked slowly. ‚ÄúMy oversight. I‚Äôll sort yours after breakfast.‚Äù

‚ÄúSee that you do.‚Äù He thrust a roll of notes at me. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a Full English in the kitchen. Prepare lunches‚Äîtwo portions. Yoan‚Äôs barely eaten since Hazel‚Äôs decline.‚Äù

I pocketed the cash. ‚ÄúNaturally.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd ensure my case is ready by noon,‚Äù he called over his shoulder. ‚Äú‚ÄòCritical meeting at the office.‚Äù

The door snapped shut behind him before I could muster a retort. I stared at the void where he‚Äôd stood‚Äîthe man who once lavished me with devotion now reduced to a spectre in his own home.

In our first year, my silences would unravel him. He‚Äôd arrive with armfuls of peonies from Covent Garden, book spontaneous weekends in the Cotswolds, his apologies whispered against my neck. Now, even my absence went unmarked.

He‚Äôs severed himself from us, Sky observed, her voice a blade sheathed in sorrow.

‚ÄúThen we owe no explanations,‚Äù I murmured, padding to the en suite. Let the scalding water purge his scent from my skin.



Chapter 5

Breakfast was ashes on my tongue. At the butcher‚Äôs, I selected cuts with methodical cruelty, ribeye for Nathaniel, venison for Yoan. A culinary send-off laced with silent venom.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll need a proper carnivorous spread,‚Äù Sky remarked, her tone laced with grim levity.

‚ÄúNaturally.‚Äù I pictured his face when he discovered the emptied wardrobes, the hollowed-out study.

On the walk back, I lingered at the training grounds. The newest recruits‚Äîpuppies, really‚Äîdrilled under the Gammas‚Äô barked orders. My chest tightened. Last time you‚Äôll play the dutiful Luna.

At the kiosk, I bought every Jammie Dodger and Penguin bar in stock. They swarmed me, all gap-toothed grins and grass-stained knees.

‚ÄúThanks a lot, Luna!‚Äù they chorused, one freckled boy clutching my sleeve. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre proper angelic, you are. Don‚Äôt let no one say otherwise!‚Äù

I knelt, smoothing his cowlick. ‚ÄúMind your Gamma. And never apologise for second helpings.‚Äù

Their praise lodged like shrapnel in my throat. ‚ÄúPersevere,‚Äù I urged, forcing a smile. Did they sense the valediction beneath my gestures? The finality?

Back in the kitchen, I assembled two tiffin carriers‚Äîone for him, one for her. Once, I‚Äôd packed twin meals for our shared lunches in his office: debating policy over Coronation chicken sandwiches, stealing crisps from his plate. Now, I was little more than a courier for his indifference.

When did the erosion begin? I wondered, arranging samosas with surgical precision. After her mate‚Äôs death? Or earlier‚Äîwhen his eyes first lingered too long on her mourning black?

The walk to his office felt surreal, as though observing a stranger enacting this pantomime of devotion. Last lunch. Last compromise. Last shred of hope discarded.

The room stood empty, stale coffee crusting a mug emblazoned with World‚Äôs Best Alpha. Predictable. His new Beta shrugged: ‚ÄúWith Beta Yoan. Her girl‚Äôs taken a turn.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll wait,‚Äù I said, tone flat.

Alone, I approached his desk. The drawer slid open with a conspiratorial whisper. Beneath requisition forms lay the pack seal‚Äîa tarnished silver wolf‚Äôs head.

Hands steady, I stamped the transfer documents Alpha Malcolm had provided. No signature required.

A shuddering breath escaped me. One copy abandoned on the desk; the other secreted in my handbag. My visa to sovereignty.

‚ÄúNow, the final‚Ä¶‚Äù My whisper died as Yoan‚Äôs voice slithered through the pack bond.

Angie, darling‚ÄîNathaniel mentioned you‚Äôre lurking in his office? Do be a love and bring lunch here. He‚Äôs ever so peckish.

Honeyed poison. My jaw clenched. The memory of last month‚Äôs ‚Äúfamily dinner‚Äù surfaced‚ÄîHazel‚Äôs pointed silence, Yoan‚Äôs saccharine pity, Iona‚Äôs trembling lower lip.

Still, this would be my final grovelling act.

‚ÄúCourse,‚Äù I bit out, boots scuffing laminate.

Yoan‚Äôs terraced house reeked of bergamot and deceit. Jeremy answered, shirt half-buttoned, trousers misaligned.

‚ÄúWho authorised this visit?‚Äù he snapped, jerking his belt buckle.

My gaze flickered past him to Yoan, swathed in a silk dressing gown. ‚ÄúInterrupting something?‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be absurd,‚Äù she purred, a Butter-wouldn‚Äôt-melt tone. ‚ÄúI insisted you come. Nathaniel, darling‚Äîstop glowering.‚Äù

Nathaniel‚Äîshoeless, collar askew‚Äîcollapsed onto her Chesterfield as if born to it.

‚ÄúDo come in, Angie,‚Äù Yoan simpered, plucking the tiffin carrier from my grip. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs make this civil.‚Äù

I trailed her through the cramped hallway, the air thick with jasmine and performative grief.

‚ÄúHow‚Äôve you been coping?‚Äù I asked, the question ash on my tongue.

She arranged her face into a mask of martyrdom. ‚ÄúOh, dreadful at first. But Carl‚Äôs sacrifice was the Moon Goddess‚Äôs design, wasn‚Äôt it? One mustn‚Äôt question divine will.‚Äù Her eyes remained arid.

Pity Carl died before learning his wife and child enjoy toying with another‚Äôs husband, I thought, spooning dal onto porcelain.

Yoan‚Äôs gaze snagged on the mating brand beneath my collar. ‚ÄúNathaniel mentioned that‚Ä¶ mark. Quaint, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù

‚ÄúA temporary brand,‚Äù I said, ladling rice with excessive care. ‚ÄúYours with Carl was genuine, of course. Mine‚Äôs merely ink.‚Äù

Her mouth tightened. As I turned to set the table, my phone trilled‚ÄîAllison.

Stepping onto the rain-slicked porch, I answered.

‚ÄúAngie‚ÄîMalcolm‚Äôs intel checks out?‚Äù My brother‚Äôs voice crackled with static and worry. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not fleeing because he‚Äôs hurt you?‚Äù

My breath hitched. ‚ÄúTransfer‚Äôs underway. How‚Äôs Mum?‚Äù

‚ÄúPining. We all are. When?‚Äù

‚ÄúTonight. Tomorrow. Soon.‚Äù

Through the window, I watched Yoan feed Nathaniel a samosa, her fingers lingering near his lips.

‚ÄúSoon,‚Äù I repeated, the word a vow.

The call disconnected. Nathaniel stood framed in the doorway, his collar still askew.

‚ÄúWho was that?‚Äù A question sharp as a papercut.

‚ÄúAllison,‚Äù I said, meeting his gaze unflinching. ‚ÄúEnquiring after my wellbeing.‚Äù

He nodded, a bureaucrat‚Äôs gesture. ‚ÄúJoin us, then.‚Äù No apology. No acknowledgement of the obscenity. Merely logistics.

The sheer banality of his presumption stole my breath. No flicker of remorse‚Äîonly the mild irritation of a man whose mistress‚Äôs lunch had gone cold.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll pass.‚Äù My smile could‚Äôve carved glass. ‚ÄúOther obligations.‚Äù

‚ÄúSuit yourself. Home later.‚Äù He turned, already halfway back to Yoan‚Äôs simpering laughter.

Not your home. Not anymore.

Drizzle stung my cheeks as I hailed a black cab. My destination is the Family Division of the High Court. Final affidavits. Dissolution of a marital contract signed in youthful delusion.

But first, a necessary detour is the hospital mortuary. A hollow-eyed clerk processed Iona‚Äôs burial permit when I presented the document embossed with Nathaniel‚Äôs seal. No condolences. No hesitation. The mortuary staff moved with unseemly haste, transferring my daughter‚Äôs precious burden to the Black Widow Pack‚Äôs morgue under cover of administrative efficiency.

As I approached the courthouse steps, uncertainty coiled cold in my chest. My hand lingered on the brass handle, the weight of finality pressing upon me. \*Was this truly the path?\*

Then it returned‚Äîthe sting of that wretched evening, the hissed taunts, the spectacle of Nathaniel and Yoan‚Äôs entwined laughter while I faded into obscurity. Their bonded status, confirmed and celebrated, had seared through the pack like a brushfire, scorching the last fragile embers of our marital pretence.

I drew a sharp breath, knuckles whitening on the doorframe.

‚ÄúLive joyfully with your mate, Nathaniel,‚Äù I hissed to the empty air.

‚ÄúAnd I shall carve my own happiness from the ashes.‚Äù

The divorce papers bore my signature in swift, ink-black strokes. At home, I arranged the documents with clinical care‚Äîtwin wedding bands gleaming dully beside them‚Äîand scrawled a note of glacial brevity, ‚ÄòKindly arrange to sign.‚Äô

When I was done, I picked up my suitcase and left. This time, leave forever.

By dusk, I was speeding north, the Pearl Harbour Pack dissolving in my rearview. Relief coursed through me, sharp and bracing, yet beneath it thrummed a wire of tension. The transfer papers in my glovebox were stamped, lawful, irrefutable‚Äîbut would border guards truly permit a Luna to slip quietly into exile?

I needn‚Äôt have doubted. News of Nathaniel‚Äôs bonded union had outpaced even my departure. The officers at the checkpoint merely inclined their heads‚Äîa gesture hovering between deference and pity‚Äîand ushered me through without a word.

Dawn found me crossing into Black Widow territory, the jagged silhouette of my old life crumbling behind me.

Fatigue had long since been incinerated by adrenaline. Twelve hours of nocturnal motorways had left me thrumming with restless purpose‚Äîto reclaim my birthright, to bury my daughter with the rites denied by Pearl Harbour‚Äôs soulless protocols.

The Black Widow‚Äôs border cut across the moor like a blade. A lean silhouette materialised from the mist, collar upturned against the dawn chill. Allison.

I braked, wheels crunching gravel. He pried open the driver‚Äôs door before I‚Äôd cut the engine.

‚ÄúWelcome home, you absolute menace,‚Äù he drawled, though his gaze darted past me to the empty backseat. ‚ÄúShift over. And where‚Äî‚Äù His voice fractured, just once. ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs the tiny terror who owes me five birthday piggybacks?‚Äù

""I‚ÄîIona..."" The words withered in my throat as my eyes fixed on the small coffin perched on the passenger seat.

Allison‚Äôs face contorted‚Äîfear, rage, desolation‚Äîas if words had abandoned her entirely.

""What‚Äôs happened, Angie?"" she whispered, brittle.

Before I could answer, Nathaniel‚Äôs voice ruptured through my mind‚Äîa mindlink frayed with terror, fury, raw and jagged as shattered glass.

Since covid I've had a lot of problems with mental health, and have been with mum and dad all my life in our family home... we aren't a traditional family and still live at home or in the house next door. Dad was and is my best friend, my other family members are close to one another but with me having struggled so much with mental health and depression there's a noticeable gap between them and me, although I have been as supportive and present as humanly possible since dad passed and haven't been in my bedroom once (where I used to hide away)

This is the first death of an immediate family member I've experienced and it is the most heartbreaking and traumatising thing, I often find myself wishing I simply had depression and not this sense of grief and loss because wow, it's worlds harder. It feels like he was stolen from us before his time... the night before he was seemingly absolutely fine, we were laughing and gaming and watching TV together as usual and the next morning I was holding his hand as his blood pressure plummeted in the hospital... every waking day is a living nightmare and the only purpose I have is looking after our old family dog and sleeping downstairs with him like dad used to do. Other than that I have no will to go on, although I will because it wouldn't be fair to dishonour dad's name like that... I know I have to be strong for him but it's tearing me apart

I've lived quite a sheltered life, I don't have any friends... I can't go out for a coffee, or to talk... or even a hug like my family can because there's no one there. No one calls me or checks in, I just sit by myself in my own thoughts not realising how much damage it's doing to me. I just don't know what to do with myself or who to turn to but I'm struggling so much more than I can put to words without dad here and all I want is him back here with us. We are a house of girls now (me, mum and younger sister) which you'd think would be the most supportive place of all but it is silent and distant and everyone gets on with their own things, which I would never begrudge them for as everyone copes in their own ways... I just wish things were different

This has knocked reality into me and I wish I had worked on my mental health years ago so that I wouldn't be suffocating as much right now but there's nothing I can do... I guess I just need anyone to listen or advice on what I can do to help myself

1l7smvo,https://www.reddit.com/r/TicketToEverywhere/comments/1l7smvo/the_best_hotels_in_ny/,The Best Hotels in NY,"There's something almost mystical about stepping into the marble-clad lobby of a legendary New York hotel for the first time. I'll never forget my initial encounter with The Plaza's gold-leafed chandeliers casting warm light across champagne-colored walls, or the way the St. Regis doorman's white gloves caught my attention as he welcomed me into what felt like a scene from *The Great Gatsby*. After years of exploring this incredible city and staying at dozens of properties across all five boroughs, I've learned that choosing the right hotel in NYC isn't just about finding a place to sleep‚Äîit's about stepping into the very soul of the city.

Whether you're planning your first Manhattan adventure or you're a seasoned New York visitor looking for something fresh, the hotel you choose can absolutely make or break your experience. From century-old institutions where royalty has slept to cutting-edge boutique properties that capture the city's creative spirit, NYC's hotel scene is as diverse as the neighborhoods they call home.

# The Luxury Legends That Define NYC Hospitality

# The Plaza - Where Fairy Tales Come to Life

Walking through The Plaza's revolving doors feels like entering a time machine set to the city's most glamorous era. This **iconic Midtown Manhattan landmark** has been hosting the world's elite since 1907, and honestly, it shows in the most magnificent way possible. The lobby's soaring ceilings, adorned with crystal chandeliers that could illuminate small cities, create an atmosphere that's both grand and surprisingly intimate.

What sets The Plaza apart isn't just its **prime Fifth Avenue location** overlooking Central Park‚Äîthough that view from the upper floors at sunrise is absolutely breathtaking. It's the attention to detail that makes you feel like royalty. During my last stay, the concierge not only secured impossible-to-get dinner reservations but also arranged for fresh peonies to be delivered to my room because I'd mentioned they were my favorite flowers in passing.

The rooms themselves are a masterclass in elegant luxury. Think rich fabrics, marble bathrooms that rival those found in European palaces, and windows that frame some of the most coveted views in Manhattan. Pro tip: if you're celebrating something special, splurge on a **Central Park view suite**‚Äîwatching the park transform through the seasons from your window is pure magic.

# The St. Regis - Timeless Elegance in Midtown

If The Plaza is Manhattan's grand dame, then **The St. Regis is its sophisticated sister**. Located at the corner of 55th Street and Fifth Avenue, this Beaux-Arts masterpiece has been redefining luxury hospitality since 1904. What truly distinguishes the St. Regis experience is their legendary **24-hour butler service**‚Äîand no, this isn't just some marketing gimmick.

My butler, Marcus, somehow anticipated my needs before I even knew I had them. Fresh coffee appeared exactly when I needed it, my suits were pressed to perfection, and when I mentioned wanting to explore some hidden local gems, he provided a handwritten list of neighborhood secrets that no guidebook could match. The **King Cole Bar**, home of the original Bloody Mary (they call it a ""Red Snapper"" here), remains one of the city's most sophisticated watering holes.

The rooms are spacious by Manhattan standards, featuring rich mahogany furnishings and marble bathrooms with deep soaking tubs that are perfect for unwinding after a day of exploring the city. The location puts you within walking distance of Central Park, Fifth Avenue shopping, and the Theater District.

# The Carlyle - Upper East Side Sophistication

Tucked away on East 76th Street, **The Carlyle represents old-money elegance** at its finest. This Rosewood property has been a discreet haven for celebrities, politicians, and discerning travelers since 1930, and it maintains an air of exclusivity that money simply can't buy elsewhere.

The **Bemelmans Bar**, with its whimsical murals by the creator of the beloved Madeline children's books, serves some of the city's finest cocktails in an atmosphere that feels like a well-kept secret. Live jazz performances here are intimate affairs where you might find yourself sitting next to a Broadway star or a renowned author‚Äîthe kind of New York experience that feels almost cinematic.

Each room is uniquely decorated with antique furnishings and original artwork, creating spaces that feel more like elegant private residences than hotel rooms. The **Caf√© Carlyle** has hosted legendary performers from Bobby Short to Woody Allen, making it a cultural institution as much as a dining venue.

# Boutique Gems That Capture NYC's Soul

# The Crosby Street Hotel - SoHo's British Charm

Kit Kemp's first New York outpost brought a delightfully fresh perspective to SoHo when it opened in 2009. **The Crosby Street Hotel** stands out with its distinctly British sensibility mixed with Manhattan edge‚Äîthink English garden prints meeting industrial SoHo architecture.

What I love most about the Crosby is how it captures the neighborhood's artistic spirit. The lobby feels like a sophisticated living room where fashion editors and gallery owners gather for afternoon tea, while the **rooftop terrace** offers stunning views of the downtown skyline. Each room features Kemp's signature bold patterns and custom furnishings, creating spaces that are both comfortable and conversation-worthy.

The location puts you in the heart of SoHo's cobblestone streets, surrounded by world-class galleries, designer boutiques, and some of the city's most innovative restaurants. It's the perfect base for exploring downtown Manhattan's creative energy.

# The High Line Hotel - Chelsea's Hidden Treasure

Housed in a former theological seminary building from 1895, **The High Line Hotel** proves that history and modern luxury can coexist beautifully. This red-brick Gothic Revival gem sits quietly on a tree-lined street in Chelsea, offering a peaceful retreat from the city's constant motion.

The hotel's **cocktail garden** features a converted 1957 double-decker London bus that serves as both bar and conversation piece. It's these quirky touches, combined with vintage rotary phones in each room and complimentary Shinola bikes for exploring the neighborhood, that make this property feel special.

The location is ideal for accessing the **High Line elevated park**, Chelsea Market, and the Meatpacking District's buzzing nightlife scene. Rooms maintain their historical character with exposed brick and original architectural details while offering modern amenities.

# 1 Hotels Central Park - Eco-Luxury Meets Nature

For travelers who want luxury without compromising their environmental values, **1 Hotels Central Park** offers an innovative approach to hospitality. This LEED-certified property uses reclaimed materials throughout, from the living moss wall in the lobby to the reclaimed wood furnishings in each room.

The **rooftop bar and restaurant** provides some of the most spectacular views of Central Park you'll find anywhere in the city. During my summer stay, I spent countless hours on the terrace watching sunset paint the park in golden hues while sipping craft cocktails made with ingredients from the hotel's own garden.

What impressed me most was how the hotel's commitment to sustainability enhanced rather than hindered the luxury experience. The in-room air purification systems, organic bath products, and locally-sourced dining options all contributed to a sense of wellness that's rare in Manhattan hotels.

# Modern Marvels and Rooftop Dreams

# Virgin Hotels New York - Broadway's Bold Statement

**Voted #1 Hotel in New York by Travel + Leisure in 2024**, Virgin Hotels New York brings Richard Branson's irreverent style to the heart of the Theater District. This property perfectly balances playful design with sophisticated amenities, creating an atmosphere that's both fun and refined.

The **rooftop pool and bar** offers stunning 360-degree views of the Manhattan skyline, while the ground-floor restaurant serves innovative cuisine in a space that buzzes with creative energy. What sets Virgin apart is their commitment to making luxury accessible‚Äîevery detail from the mobile check-in to the in-room entertainment systems is designed with the modern traveler in mind.

# The William Vale - Brooklyn's Crown Jewel

While technically across the East River in Williamsburg, **The William Vale** offers some of the most dramatic Manhattan skyline views you'll find anywhere. This sleek, modern property represents Brooklyn's evolution into a luxury destination in its own right.

The hotel's **rooftop pool** provides an entirely different perspective of the city, while the ground-floor restaurant has become a destination for food lovers from both sides of the river. The rooms are spacious and modern, with floor-to-ceiling windows that showcase the Manhattan skyline in all its glory.

# Neighborhood Champions

# Midtown West - Theater District Convenience

For theater lovers, staying in **Midtown West** puts you within walking distance of Broadway's biggest shows. The **Chatwal Hotel** offers Art Deco glamour just steps from Times Square, while properties like the **Knickerbocker** provide modern luxury with Instagram-worthy rooftop bars.

The neighborhood can be crowded, especially around Times Square, but the convenience of being able to walk to shows, restaurants, and major attractions makes it worthwhile for many visitors.

# Lower Manhattan - Financial District Finds

Downtown Manhattan offers a different kind of New York experience, with historic cobblestone streets and stunning harbor views. **The Greenwich Hotel** in Tribeca (co-owned by Robert De Niro) provides ultimate luxury and privacy, while newer properties like **Casa Cipriani** bring Italian sophistication to the waterfront.

This area is perfect for visitors who want to explore neighborhoods like SoHo, Tribeca, and the West Village while still having easy access to major attractions via subway.

# Insider Tips for Choosing Your Perfect NYC Stay

**Location is everything** in New York City. Each neighborhood has its own distinct personality, and your choice should align with your priorities. If you're here for Broadway shows and major tourist attractions, Midtown makes sense. For shopping and museum visits, the Upper East Side near Central Park is ideal. Art lovers and foodies should consider downtown neighborhoods like SoHo or the Village.

**Book directly with hotels** when possible‚Äîyou'll often receive room upgrades, late checkout, and other perks that third-party booking sites can't offer. Many luxury properties offer special packages that include dining credits, spa treatments, or tickets to local attractions.

**Consider the season** when choosing your hotel. Summer rooftop access becomes crucial, while winter might make indoor pools and spa facilities more appealing. Spring and fall offer the best weather for exploring on foot, making location even more important.

**Don't overlook service levels**. The difference between a good hotel and a great one often comes down to staff who remember your preferences and anticipate your needs. Properties like The St. Regis and The Carlyle have built their reputations on exceptional service that creates truly memorable experiences.

# Your NYC Hotel Adventure Awaits

Choosing the perfect hotel in New York City is about more than just finding a clean room and comfortable bed‚Äîit's about finding your gateway into the Manhattan experience. Whether you're drawn to the timeless elegance of The Plaza, the artistic flair of boutique properties like The Crosby Street Hotel, or the modern luxury of Virgin Hotels New York, each property offers its own unique lens through which to explore this incredible city.

The hotels I've shared represent the very best of what NYC has to offer, from century-old institutions that have hosted royalty to cutting-edge properties that are redefining modern hospitality. Each provides not just accommodation, but a doorway into different aspects of the city's character.

What makes a hotel truly memorable isn't just its thread count or marble bathrooms‚Äîit's those moments when you feel like you've discovered something special, whether that's a hidden rooftop bar with stunning skyline views or a concierge who helps you uncover neighborhood secrets that most visitors never find.

In high school, I was the class clown, the bookworm, the rebel‚Äîwhoever I needed to be. By adulthood, I‚Äôd perfected the art of mirroring‚Äîmatching people‚Äôs body language, speech patterns, even their favorite phrases. I read books on persuasion, micro-expressions, and dark psychology, not for self-defense, but to control every room I entered. At work, I used these skills to climb fast.

I even manipulated a rival into sabotaging herself by planting doubts during coffee breaks.

At a company retreat, my work friends and my outside friends ended up at the same dinner table. I panicked, realizing I‚Äôd told each group completely different stories about myself.

I never thought I‚Äôd be writing something like this at this stage in my life. But here I am, sitting with a kind of ache I didn‚Äôt expect to feel again. 

I‚Äôm 50 and divorced, and after years of focusing on myself, my work, and my healing, I finally felt ready to give dating another try. I downloaded a dating app, cautiously hopeful, fully aware that dating in your 50s comes with its own set of challenges. Still, I believe in connection at any age.

A few weeks ago, I matched with a man who seemed genuine, grounded, and kind. We‚Äôre close in age, had similar values, and shared a quiet understanding of life‚Äôs ups and downs. Our conversations flowed naturally‚Äîabout family, travel, old music, favorite foods, and even the things we don‚Äôt always admit easily. We messaged every day. Sometimes it was light and funny, sometimes deep and thoughtful. It made me feel alive again. Seen.

After a few weeks, we finally met in person. It was warm. Comfortable. Easy. Nothing over-the-top, just two people enjoying a slow afternoon coffee, talking like we‚Äôd known each other longer than we had. There was no awkwardness‚Äîjust presence. He even said he was looking forward to the next time.

Two days later, he sent a short message. Just a quick, kind check-in. I replied.

And then... nothing.

I waited a day, then another. Sent a gentle follow-up. Still nothing. He hasn‚Äôt even read my message. But I can see he‚Äôs been online. Active. Present‚Äîjust not with me. No explanation. No goodbye. Just silence. Cold and quiet.

It‚Äôs not the first time I‚Äôve experienced loss or disappointment, but this particular kind of silence stings in a different way. Not because of what we had‚Äîafter all, it was new‚Äîbut because of the emotional vulnerability it takes to try again at this age. To open up. To believe that maybe, just maybe, something good is starting.

I‚Äôve been sitting with this question: Was it all just one-sided? Or did he simply lose interest and not have the courage to say so?

What hurts the most is the lack of respect. I wasn‚Äôt asking for a commitment‚ÄîI just thought we owed each other honesty. A kind word. A proper ending.

Has anyone else experienced something like this later in life? How do you stop taking the silence personally? How do you keep showing up for love without growing bitter?

Thanks for listening. Just needed to get this out of my heart.

Der teuerste Kaffe, den ich mir bisher selbst gekauft hatte (und das war zu Weihnachten) kostete 200‚Ç¨ pro Kilo (habe auch nur 125g davon bestellt).

Remember when Siri first started speaking and it felt like we slipped into a sci-fi movie? Well, now she‚Äôs multilingual and hosting a global conference call‚Äîsimultaneously! At Apple‚Äôs recent WWDC 2025 showcase, they unveiled an expansion of Apple Intelligence's language capabilities‚Äîa whopping eight new languages are joining the roster by year‚Äôs end. That‚Äôs hotter than a new iPhone launch at a Black Friday sale.

### What‚Äôs the Big Deal?

Apple‚Äôs foray into adding Danish, Dutch, Norwegian, Portuguese (Portugal), Swedish, Turkish, Chinese (Traditional), and Vietnamese isn‚Äôt just another notch on their innovation belt. It‚Äôs about breaking down language barriers, making Siri a global ambassador of AI. Honestly, could this mean more meaningful interactions, or is it just another reason for Siri to mishear us in eight more languages?

### Live Translation: Is This the Tower of Babel or the UN?

Imagine texting in your native tongue and having it fluidly translated as you type. Apple‚Äôs new live translation feature does just that, promising a seamless interaction across different languages‚Äîwhether you're in a text chat, a phone conversation, or even a FaceTime call. It‚Äôs AI‚Äôs version of ""speak your truth,"" just with a few additional commas and perhaps a mispronounced word.

### Learning Languages: Your New AI Sensei

For us polyglots and language learners, leveraging AI as a tool to navigate through language learning is like discovering the Rosetta Stone‚Äîagain, but faster. You ask, the AI answers, and somewhere in between, you miraculously learn how to order coffee in Turkish without starting a diplomatic incident.

### Future Implications: Language Learning and Global Connectivity

The advent of these new capabilities invites the tantalizing possibility of AI as an educator, a translator, and perhaps, a bridge between cultures. However, with power comes responsibility‚Äîwill AI blur the lines of authentic communication, or has it finally hit the bulls-eye of global inclusivity?

## Key Features Analysis

The Scandal perfume line is characterized by its bold and unconventional blends, each scent possessing a unique personality.

**Signature Honey Note:** At the heart of many scandal fragrances lies a prominent honey note. This isn't your typical saccharine honey; it's frequently enough combined with other ingredients to create a multifaceted sweetness. The honey adds warmth, depth, and an irresistible gourmand quality that defines the Scandal signature.

**Provocative Bottle Design:** The iconic Scandal bottle is instantly recognizable. Featuring sculpted female legs kicking up in the air, the bottle embodies the playful and daring spirit of the fragrance. The design is a conversation starter and a statement piece for any perfume collection.

**Long-lasting Sillage:** scandal perfumes are known for their notable longevity and sillage. Sillage refers to the trail of scent left behind as you move. Scandal fragrances are designed to make a lasting impression, ensuring you'll be noticed without being overpowering.

**High-Quality Ingredients:** Jean Paul Gaultier uses premium ingredients in the scandal line, contributing to the overall quality and complexity of the scents. From the selection of floral essences to the sourcing of specific honey varieties, the focus on quality ensures a luxurious olfactory experience.

The Scandal perfumes each have unique notes that are used to create a wide range of scents:

*   Floral notes like orange blossom and jasmine
*   Gourmand notes like caramel and tonka bean

So I noticed that sometimes I was very hungry and when I started a meal I didn't really taste my food even when I tried. I tried adding more salt and sugar to enhance the flavor. A win for me is that just now right before writing this I learnt that I might have been too hungry, because as I had a few bites in, slowed down, and then started to sip of my coffee and keep eating that that's when I tasted the food MUCH better. Is it because my body was devestated to get some food in the system? 

Another thing is is that I struggle with getting hunger cues. I found ways to cope with stress, instead of food. But sometimes I wonder where my hunger signal is. Is it when I start thinking of food, or when I get irritated, or once my stomach starts growling? And do I eat as soon as I feel hungry? Or is it okay to feel the hunger for a bit but then that's all that's on my mind, instead of being okay not to eat for a little while. Like for example on my bike ride home I knew that I would eat as soon as I get home, and I love being able to eat as I feel my hunger. I also had a energy bar on me but knowing if I would eat that I would have less apetite for dinner. But the whole ride home I was not driving as hard as I could and constantly with my next meal on my mind.

A Custom fit design is paramount for effective floor protection.Mats designed specifically for Sprinter van models (2007-2018, 2019+, etc.) offer precise contours that match the floor pan, ensuring complete coverage. These mats typically utilize laser measurements to guarantee a snug fit, preventing dirt and debris from reaching the underlying carpet.A well-fitting mat will also minimize slippage, enhancing safety.

A Texted surface provides enhanced grip, preventing your feet from slipping, especially in wet conditions. Raised edges or lips around the perimeter of the mat play a critical role in containing spills and preventing them from spreading to the carpet. This feature is particularly significant for preventing damage from water, mud, and corrosive substances. The height of the raised edges can vary, with deeper channels offering superior containment.

**Easy Cleaning and Maintenance**

Cleaning and maintenance should be straightforward for practical use. Rubber and TPE mats can typically be hosed down or wiped clean with a damp cloth. Some mats are even dishwasher safe. Carpeted mats may require vacuuming or spot cleaning to remove stains and debris. Easy removal and reinstallation are also essential for convenient cleaning.

**Odorless and Non-toxic Materials**

The Use of odorless and non-toxic materials is crucial for maintaining a healthy and agreeable cabin surroundings. Low-quality mats may emit unpleasant odors,especially when exposed to heat. Look for mats that are certified as free from harmful chemicals such as PVC and BPA. This ensures that the mats do not negatively impact the air quality inside your Sprinter van, particularly important for those who spend extended periods of time in their vehicles.

**Anchor Points and Anti-Slip Backing**

Anchor Points and anti-slip backing prevent the mats from shifting during driving. Many Sprinter vans come equipped with factory anchor points that can be used to secure the mats in place. Mats with a textured or studded backing provide additional grip on the floor, further reducing the risk of slippage. These features are critically important for maintaining safety and preventing the mats from interfering with the pedals.

Fast forward to this weekend‚Äî2025. I‚Äôm in NYC for a quick trip, catching up with friends. I walk into a random coffee shop‚Ä¶ and I freeze. Her sister is sitting there. She recognizes me but says nothing‚Äîshe‚Äôs deep in conversation. And then I see my ex, sitting with her back turned.

Everything inside me just‚Ä¶ stopped. I panicked. Ordered a coffee, stood in line, glued to my phone pretending not to notice. No eye contact. Nothing.

Then her sister and she head to the restroom. Maybe her sister told her I was there, I don‚Äôt know. When they came back, my ex walked directly in front of me, cutting through the line‚Äîmaybe wanting me to see her? I didn‚Äôt look up. Just stared at my phone like I didn‚Äôt even register it.

Now I‚Äôm home with my mind racing. What if I had said something? Just ‚Äúhi‚Äù? Asked how she‚Äôs doing? Shared where I‚Äôm at now?

And here‚Äôs the messed-up part: I‚Äôm in a relationship now. She‚Äôs amazing‚Äîon paper, everything I want. But that spark? That unexplainable connection I had back then? It‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ not the same. And I hate that I‚Äôm thinking about all this, but I am.

Don‚Äôt even know what I‚Äôm looking for here. Just needed to get it out.",5,1749539313.0,ExNoContact,0,1.0,False
1l7sab8,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1l7sab8/acid_trip_and_possible_domestic_violence/,Acid trip and possible Domestic Violence,"When I(M) turned 26 I planned a good size party of 15 people max of close friends at my friends Linda(25) and John‚Äôs(29) apartment who offered to host. 

I‚Äôve known them since elementary school. John used to live across the street and Linda was best friends with his sister. They got close after school and ended up together and I started hanging out with them more and more.

Well I‚Äôm a bit of the ‚Äúhippie‚Äù type and single so I‚Äôm known to do shrooms and party up. I grew up with the Chicano culture and all my friends were white so we had a ‚ÄúCholo‚Äù party. 

The last few years I‚Äôve been throwing my own birthday party so this year I brought Tamales, rice, beans, 10 pairs of sunglasses, a dozen bandanas, and some special surprises.

Everyone shows up and all is well. Everyone is laughing. All is fine. Well I decided to get out the surprises..

I pull out the blunt and everyone heads out to the stairs to smoke besides a few people and Linda. Well when we came back inside I was ready to bring out the second part.

I followed John to the back room and I asked him if he wanted to party? He laughed and asked what I had and I pulled out a sheet of 10 tabs of acid. 

We both knew previously try to keep hush on doing mushrooms. Linda always got mad but she also did ‚Äúsnow‚Äù and drank way too much. 

Normally we just do shrooms and weed but I figured why not go a little wild. He told me he done way worse so I had no thought about it. We took a tab each. 

Well what happens next is normal. I come back, stoned and grinning and just way too happy. She sinced something was afoot. 

Laughing she asked ‚Äúokay did yall take some shrooms?‚Äù I started to laugh which made her laugh even more. Finally I told her ‚Äúnope acid‚Äù and she shook her head and laughed. 

The night went on and she eventually took one as well. We drank and drank and kept taking tabs till I was out. I had at least 4 and my bud had 2 or 3. 

The party lasted about 6 or 7 hours but we tarted ‚Äúthe surprise‚Äù about 3 hours in. As everyone was leaving he started to feel himself I guess and started to flirt with his girl more and more.

Finally when it was just us 3 we watched YouTube and smoked a blunt. As we smoked he became more noticeably horny.. making out,straight up groping her and fondling her infront of me. She was feeling it too but for some odd reason he didn‚Äôt want to take it to the room.

We both found it hilarious and eventually after telling him to get a room he finally went with her. I came back to watch Fast X and layed down to finish my night.

Now a thing about them two. They are very co dependent but don‚Äôt trust each other and always fight. They have problems way beyond me bringing shrooms and acid but they both blame me sleeping with the other.(I‚Äôm just curious sexually but like women way more) 

John likes to come home and drink a beer with a joint in his hand and has a history of cheating. She stays at home and parties when she wants to and often a little to hard and lies.
So often if he wanted to be a stick in the mud I‚Äôd go with her and all her home girls but mostly we hung out there.

Every-once in a while they argue. And they did that night. Idk what was said because I tuned it out like I did growing up. 

Next thing I knew she came out of her room screaming my name and hollering saying that he hit her. She said that in the past but I never witnessed it and wasn‚Äôt the first time she ran out from another room saying that and looked fine. 

She lied to people infront of me and I‚Äôve caught her before. So I always just minded my business unless she was obviously assaulted. Now days I‚Äôm afraid of false accusations of anyone dealing with domestic violence.

Well that whole ordeal happens over and over thru the night till something new she tells me. Apparently he was speaking demon talk.

That was way too wild of an accusation so I had to see. I go in there and he was. Laying in his bed trying to talk to me, all he spoke was some words and slurred gibberish but understood what I was saying by the way he talked. 

I been there before and when I spoke I couldn‚Äôt so I rubbed that off as well. She stayed in the living room with me for 5 minutes. She was upset that I wasn‚Äôt doing anything and I was telling her why I can‚Äôt step in from them just yelling.

Well then he came stumbling on in all pissed off and accused us of doing stuff and really ranting is what I heard. Something happened in his mind where he thought it was a good idea to put his hands in my shoulder.

I was sitting down. John was a dad. Growing up my dad did that to me and ONLY he can do that to me. He squeezed my shoulder like a child and I lost it. 

I‚Äôm normally never wanting a fight or conflict unless you throw something serious like this. I younked gis ass infront of me and broke his wooden coffee table in the process.

I had my hand around his neck and Linda called the cops. 

I released my grip and was breathing like a bull. The growl and all. I hauled ass into the kitchen and grabbed my mom‚Äôs dishes and ran down the stairs from the apartment right when the cops pulled up.

I was in the car and had it started but I couldn‚Äôt take off. I knew running would be no good if I could see them. The officer asks me what‚Äôs going on and I spilled out everything. 

He leaves and talks to Linda but I guess she told the truth but may have left out her getting hit. He comes back and asks if I wanted to press charges. 

I was hesitant at first but I told him no. He had kids and mostly he was mostly a good dude. Just tons of problems. 

Linda ended up going to John‚Äôs sisters house and he went inside and crashed. The officer (knowing I‚Äôm on acid and alcohol) asked me to step out of the vehicle. I thought they were gonna take me to jail but just did tests to see how impaired I was and somehow passed. 

He tried to apologize as soon as he heard what happened and eventually we called it good for the time till I parted ways due to drama in general. 

I just wanted to get this off my chest since I can‚Äôt really talk to anyone about it.

We picture ourselves strolling along cobblestone streets, savoring delectable local cuisine, and soaking in breathtaking landscapes. But then, the harsh reality of flight prices crashes down like a rogue wave, threatening to sink our travel dreams before they even leave the ground. It‚Äôs a tale as old as time, isn‚Äôt it? That burning desire to explore, locked in a frustrating dance with a limited budget. We pore over travel blogs, religiously follow fare aggregators, and whisper fervent payers to the airline gods, all hoping for that elusive cheap ticket. But what if I told you that some cities are inherently, wonderfully, blessedly cheaper to fly to than others? What if the destinations themselves held the secret to unlocking your wanderlust without completely emptying your wallet? Forget the notion that travel has to be an extravagant luxury. With a little savvy and a keen eye for certain destinations, the world really can be your oyster, and you don't need to be a millionaire to shuck it.

Unmasking the Mystery: Why Some Cities Just Won't Break the Bank (Figuratively Speaking, Of Course!)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Have you ever wondered why flying to, say, Boise, Idaho, might cost more than flying to London? It seems counterintuitive, right? London, a global hub, teeming with history and millions of people, should be pricier to access than a relatively smaller city like Boise. Well, dear traveler, it's not always about size or popularity. The aviation industry is a complex beast, influenced by a myriad of factors that ultimately determine the price of your seat. Understanding these underlying forces is key to unlocking the secrets of cheap flights, especially when you're trying to figure out the **cheapest cities to fly to**. It‚Äôs like trying to understand the currents of a vast ocean ‚Äì seemingly chaotic on the surface, but driven by powerful, predictable forces beneath.

### Deconstructing the Dollar Signs: What Makes Flights Cheaper to Certain Hubs?

Several elements conspire to make certain cities more budget-friendly for air travel. It's not just random chance; there's a method to the madness, believe it or not. Think of it like baking a cake ‚Äì you need the right ingredients and the right process to get a delicious result.

- **Competition is King:** This is perhaps the biggest driver of lower fares. When multiple airlines fly the same route, they are forced to compete for your business. This competition often manifests in lower prices to lure passengers away from their rivals. Think of it like a marketplace; the more vendors selling similar goods, the better the prices for the consumer. Major international hubs typically have a massive number of airlines vying for routes, which benefits you, the traveler.
- **Airline Volume and Infrastructure:** Cities with high passenger traffic and well-developed airport infrastructure are more likely to have a larger volume of flights. More flights mean more seats to sell, which can lead to lower prices, especially during off-peak seasons. Airports with multiple runways and terminals can handle more aircraft, further increasing capacity and potentially driving down costs.
- **Demand and Seasonality:** While not a constant, demand plays a significant role. Flying to a popular vacation spot during its peak season will inevitably be more expensive than flying during the shoulder or off-season. However, some cities have consistent, strong demand, which can stabilize prices and, in some cases, even make them cheaper due to the sheer volume of traffic.
- **Geographic Location and Connectivity:** Cities that serve as major connecting points for international travel often have more flight options and potentially lower fares. Their strategic location makes them efficient hubs for airlines to route passengers through. Think of them as the crossroads of the sky.
- **Taxes and Fees:** Believe it or not, the taxes and fees imposed by a particular airport or government can significantly impact the final ticket price. Some cities have lower associated costs for airlines, which can translate into lower fares for passengers. It's like comparing the price of a gallon of milk; sometimes the tax is the difference between a good deal and a ""ouch, that's expensive"" moment.

So, when you're searching for the **cheapest cities to fly to**, keep these factors in mind. They are the invisible hand guiding those fluctuations in price.

Ready to Roll? Dive into the Destinations That Won't Drain Your Account
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Alright, enough with the theory! You're here for the juicy details, the concrete examples, the actual places you can realistically aim for without needing to sell a kidney. Let's get down to brass tacks and explore some of the destinations that frequently pop up on lists of the **cheapest cities to fly to**. Remember, flight prices fluctuate constantly, like the stock market, but some cities consistently offer better value than others. Think of these not as static, guaranteed bargains, but as reliable candidates for finding affordable flights.

### Europe on a Shoestring (Sort Of!): Charming Cities That Won't Bankrupt You

Europe, with its rich history, diverse cultures, and breathtaking beauty, is often a dream destination. But the reality of transatlantic flights can be a bit of a nightmare for your bank account. Fear not, penny-pinching globetrotter! Several European cities consistently offer more affordable flight options from many parts of the world, particularly North America.

- **Dublin, Ireland:** Ah, Dublin! The land of lively pubs, literary giants, and friendly faces. Dublin is often a surprisingly affordable city to fly into, especially when compared to other major European capitals. This is partly due to its strategic location as a transatlantic gateway and the healthy competition among airlines flying this route. Plus, from Dublin, you can often find cheap flights to other European destinations, making it a fantastic starting point for a multi-city adventure. Strolling through Trinity College, sipping a Guinness (or two!) in Temple Bar, and exploring the breathtaking cliffs of Moher are just a few of the unforgettable experiences waiting for you. And getting there doesn't have to cost an arm and a leg!
- **Reykjavik, Iceland:** While Iceland itself can be a little pricey once you're there, flying into Reykjavik is frequently remarkably affordable. Thanks to airlines like Icelandair and budget carriers, Iceland has become an increasingly popular and accessible destination. The dramatic landscapes of glaciers, hot springs, and the Northern Lights are truly unique. Just wrap up warm, because it can get chilly! And while you're there, don't miss the Blue Lagoon ‚Äì a truly magical experience.
- **Lisbon, Portugal:** Portugal's vibrant capital is a feast for the senses, and happily, often a feast for your wallet when it comes to flights. Lisbon's popularity has grown, but it still manages to remain relatively affordable to fly into compared to some of its Western European counterparts. Think stunning architecture, delicious pastries (Pastel de Nata, anyone?), and a lively Fado music scene. Plus, the coastline is absolutely gorgeous.
- **Madrid, Spain:** Spain's dynamic capital is another excellent and often affordable entry point into Europe. Madrid boasts world-class museums, beautiful parks, and a buzzing nightlife. The cost of living in Spain is also relatively lower than in many other Western European countries, making your overall trip more budget-friendly. Don't leave without trying some tapas and soaking in the energy of the city.
- **Oslo, Norway:** Now, bear with me on this one. While Norway is notoriously expensive once you're on the ground, flying into Oslo can sometimes be surprisingly affordable. This is particularly true if you can snag a deal on a low-cost carrier. From Oslo, you can explore the stunning Norwegian fjords and experience the incredible natural beauty the country has to offer. Just be prepared for the cost of a cup of coffee to make your eyes water!

These are just a few examples, of course. Keep an eye out for deals to cities like Barcelona, Spain, and potentially even some Eastern European hubs depending on your origin point.

### Across the Pond for Less: Finding Affordable Flights within the Americas

You don't always have to fly across an ocean to find affordable flight deals. Intra-American travel can also present some fantastic opportunities to save money, especially if you're looking to explore destinations closer to home.

- **Cancun, Mexico:** A perennial favorite for beach lovers and spring breakers, Cancun is often incredibly cheap to fly to, especially from the United States. The sheer volume of flights to this popular tourist destination drives down prices, particularly outside of peak holiday periods. While Cancun itself can lean towards the touristy side, it serves as a fantastic gateway to the beautiful Riviera Maya and its ancient Mayan ruins. Think white-sand beaches, turquoise waters, and endless opportunities for relaxation and adventure.
- **Mexico City, Mexico:** Mexico's bustling capital is a vibrant and historically rich city that often offers affordable flight options. As a major international hub, Mexico City benefits from high flight volume and competition. Explore ancient Aztec ruins, wander through colorful markets, and indulge in delicious street food ‚Äì all without breaking the bank on your airfare. It's a sprawling metropolis with something for everyone.
- **Bogot√°, Colombia:** The high-altitude capital of Colombia has become an increasingly popular and accessible destination, and flights there are often quite reasonable. Bogot√° is a city of contrasts, with a charming historic center, vibrant street art, and a burgeoning culinary scene. Explore the Gold Museum, ride the cable car up Monserrate for stunning views, and immerse yourself in the city's lively atmosphere. Colombia has shed its past reputation and is now a safe and fascinating country to visit.
- **San Juan, Puerto Rico:** A US territory, flying to San Juan can sometimes feel like domestic travel in terms of price, particularly from the East Coast. This beautiful Caribbean island offers stunning beaches, a charming colonial old town, and lush rainforests. It's a fantastic option for those seeking a tropical getaway without the hassle of international travel requirements for US citizens.
- **Lima, Peru:** Peru's capital city, Lima, is often a more affordable entry point into South America. From Lima, you can easily connect to other Peruvian destinations, including the iconic Machu Picchu (though getting to Machu Picchu itself will involve additional travel and costs). Lima has a fantastic food scene, beautiful coastal views, and a rich history. It's a great starting point for exploring the wonders of Peru.

Again, this isn't an exhaustive list. Keep an eye out for deals to other major hubs in Central and South America.

The Art of the Deal: Beyond Just Picking the **Cheapest Cities to Fly To**
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Simply choosing a city that generally offers cheaper flights isn't the only trick up your sleeve. Becoming a savvy flight hunter involves a combination of destination choice and smart booking strategies. Think of it as a treasure hunt ‚Äì the treasure is the cheap flight, and you're armed with a map and some handy tools.

### Timing is Everything: When to Hit 'Book' for Maximum Savings

Just like buying stocks, the timing of your flight booking can have a significant impact on the price. It‚Äôs not an exact science, but there are definitely trends and generally accepted best practices.

- **Book in Advance (But Not *Too* Much):** While booking last minute is almost always a recipe for high prices, booking *too* far in advance isn't always the cheapest either. Prices tend to fluctuate, and airlines often release their best deals in a window somewhere between 1 to 3 months before international travel and 1 to 2 months for domestic travel. Think of it as a sweet spot where demand and availability are in balance.
- **Mid-Week is Your Friend:** Ever noticed how flights on Tuesdays and Wednesdays tend to be cheaper? That's no coincidence! Airlines know that most business travelers fly at the beginning and end of the week, and leisure travelers often prefer weekend travel. By flying mid-week, you're tapping into a less crowded and often cheaper travel period.
- **Avoid Peak Seasons and Holidays:** This one is a no-brainer, right? Flying during major holidays like Christmas, New Year's, or during peak summer vacation is going to cost you significantly more. If your dates are flexible, aim for the shoulder season (the periods just before or after the peak season) or the off-season. You‚Äôll not only save money on flights but often on accommodation and activities as well. Think fewer crowds and a more relaxed atmosphere, too!
- **Be Flexible with Your Dates and Times:** This is perhaps THE most important tip for finding cheap flights. If you can be flexible with your departure and arrival dates by a day or two, you can often find significant savings. Many flight search engines have flexible date options that show you prices for a range of dates around your desired travel period. Similarly, consider flying at less convenient times, like early morning or late night flights, which can sometimes be cheaper.

By mastering the art of timing, you're already stacking the odds in your favor when searching for the **cheapest cities to fly to**.

### Tool Up: The Best Resources for Finding Those Bargains

You wouldn't go into battle without your armor and sword, and you shouldn't go flight hunting without the right tools! Several fantastic online resources can help you compare prices, track fares, and uncover those hidden gems.

1. **Google Flights:** This is my go-to for initial searches. Its intuitive interface, calendar view showing prices for different dates, and ability to track fares for specific routes make it incredibly useful. You can also explore destinations on a map based on their price, which is a great way to discover potential **cheapest cities to fly to** that you might not have considered.
2. **Skyscanner:** Another powerful flight comparison tool. Skyscanner is great for its flexibility, allowing you to search ""Everywhere"" to see destinations ordered by price from your origin point. It's also good for finding multi-city itineraries.
3. **Momondo:** Momondo often pulls up slightly different results than Google Flights and Skyscanner, sometimes finding even cheaper deals. It has a unique ""flight insight"" feature that provides useful information about when to book and which airlines are typically cheapest for a given route.
4. **Hopper:** This app uses historical data and complex algorithms to predict future flight prices and tell you whether to book now or wait. While not always 100% accurate (it's predicting the future, after all!), it can be a helpful guide.
5. **Airline Websites (Directly):** Once you've found a good deal on a comparison site, it's always worth checking the airline's website directly. Sometimes, they offer the same price or even a slightly lower price, and booking directly can make it easier to manage your reservation down the line.

Using a combination of these tools is like having a team of detectives searching for the best possible price for that flight to one of the **cheapest cities to fly to**. Don't rely on just one!

### The Art of Packing Light (and Avoiding Baggage Fees!)

Listen, those baggage fees can add up faster than you can say ""carry-on only."" Checked bag fees and overweight baggage charges can sometimes negate any savings you found on your flight ticket. Learning to pack light is not just good for your back; it's great for your wallet.

- **Embrace the Carry-On:** Many airlines allow one carry-on bag and one personal item for free. Master the art of fitting all your essentials into a standard carry-on suitcase. There are tons of packing tutorials and strategies online to help you maximize space.
- **Wear Your Bulkiest Items:** If you're bringing a bulky jacket or a pair of boots, wear them on the plane instead of packing them. It frees up space in your luggage and keeps you warm on that potentially chilly flight!
- **Roll, Don't Fold:** Rolling your clothes can actually save space and prevent wrinkles. Give it a try ‚Äì you might be surprised how much more you can fit in your suitcase.
- **Consider a Travel Wardrobe:** Pack versatile pieces that can be mixed and matched to create multiple outfits. You don't need a completely new outfit for every single day of your trip.
- **Ship Souvenirs:** If you buy a lot of heavy souvenirs, consider shipping them home instead of lugging them onto the plane and potentially incurring hefty baggage fees.

Seriously, this isn't just about convenience; it's a real cost-saving measure when you're trying to keep your overall trip expenses down, even if you've found a great deal on your flight to one of the **cheapest cities to fly to**.

Beyond the Flight: Making the Entire Trip Budget-Friendly
---------------------------------------------------------

Finding a cheap flight is a fantastic start, but it's just one piece of the puzzle when it comes to a budget-friendly trip. You'll need a place to stay, food to eat, and things to see and do. Luckily, there are strategies for saving money on these aspects as well.

### Accommodation Hacks: Sleeping Soundly (and Affordably!)

Where you lay your head at night can significantly impact your travel budget. Hotels, while convenient, aren't always the cheapest option, especially in popular tourist areas.

- **Hostels:** Don't dismiss hostels just because you're past your backpacking days! Many hostels now offer private rooms in addition to dorms, providing a clean, safe, and social atmosphere at a much lower price point than a hotel. They're also great places to meet other travelers.
- **Airbnb and Vacation Rentals:** Renting an apartment or room through platforms like Airbnb can be a fantastic way to save money, especially if you're traveling with a group or planning a longer stay. Having access to a kitchen can also save you money on food by allowing you to prepare some of your own meals.
- **Guesthouses and Bed and Breakfasts:** In some parts of the world, local guesthouses or B&amp;Bs offer a more authentic experience and often lower prices than larger hotels. It's a great way to support local businesses and get insider tips from your hosts.
- **Consider Location:** Staying slightly outside the absolute city center can often lead to lower accommodation prices. As long as you have good public transportation connections, you can still easily reach all the main attractions.

Finding affordable accommodation is a crucial step after snagging a cheap flight to one of the **cheapest cities to fly to**.

### Eating Well on a Budget: Where to Find Delicious (and Affordable) Bites

Food is a huge part of the travel experience, but dining out for every meal can quickly drain your funds. Here are some ways to keep your food budget under control.

- **Embrace Street Food:** Many cities are renowned for their delicious and incredibly affordable street food. It's a fantastic way to sample local flavors and mingle with the locals. Just be mindful of hygiene standards, of course!
- **Cook Some Meals:** If your accommodation has kitchen facilities, hit up a local grocery store and cook some of your own meals. This is significantly cheaper than eating out for every breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
- **Look for Lunch Specials:** Many restaurants offer discounted lunch menus which can be a great way to try a restaurant you might not be able to afford for dinner.
- **Pack Snacks:** Bring some non-perishable snacks from home to tide you over between meals. This prevents impulse buys from overpriced convenience stores.
- **Drink Tap Water (Where Safe):** Buying bottled water constantly adds up. Carry a reusable water bottle and fill it up whenever possible, provided the tap water is safe to drink in that location.

Enjoying the local cuisine is a joy of travel, and these tips help you do it without completely blowing your budget, even after flying to one of the **cheapest cities to fly to**.

### Free (or Cheap) Things to Do: Experience the City Without Spending a Fortune

You don't need to pay for expensive tours and attractions to experience the essence of a city. Many of the best things to see and do are completely free or very low cost.

- **Walk Around:** Simply wandering through different neighborhoods, observing local life, and soaking in the atmosphere is one of the best ways to experience a city. It‚Äôs completely free and offers a unique perspective.
- **Visit Free Museums and Galleries:** Many cities offer free entry to certain museums or have specific free entry days or times. Do your research beforehand!
- **Explore Parks and Gardens:** Public parks are a great place to relax, people-watch, and enjoy some greenery. They‚Äôre usually free to enter and offer a peaceful escape from the urban hustle and bustle.
- **Attend Free Events:** Check local websites and community boards for free concerts, festivals, markets, or other events happening during your visit.
- **Take a Free Walking Tour:** Many cities offer free walking tours led by local guides who work on tips. It's a fantastic way to get an overview of the city and learn about its history and culture. Remember to tip your guide!

Filling your itinerary with free or low-cost activities is a smart way to stretch your travel budget, allowing you to enjoy your chosen one of the **cheapest cities to fly to** to the fullest.

***Step 1:*** *If you are playing the midnight game, you must first write your full name on a piece of paper. Then you must use a sharp object to place a single drop of your blood onto the paper.*

***Step 2:*** *Place the paper behind a closed wooden door (an entrance door is preferred but not necessary).*

***Step 4:*** *Knock on your chosen door exactly 22 times (the 22nd knock must happen at 12:00 AM or the ritual will not work.)*

***Step 5:*** *Open your door, blow out the candle, and then close it. You have now summoned and welcomed the ‚ÄúMidnight Man.‚Äù Immediately relight your candle.*

***Step 6:*** *Your goal for the rest of the game is to evade the Midnight Man.*

\*\*\*

I followed every step. I went to the store, bought a thick white candle plus a couple of backups, two lighters, a box of matches with individual books, and a large carton of salt. I went home, read the lengthy online directions again just to make sure I had it right, and then I waited.

For the rest of the day, I stayed home and paced next to the door leading to my basement. I figured it was the best spot use for the ritual. I couldn‚Äôt leave once the game began, and my house only had two floors and the basement. I figured that if I started at the bottom, the only place I could go was up. I laughed out loud, but it didn‚Äôt make me feel any better.

My stomach would plummet to the floor every time I checked my watch, seeing that each hour flew by as fast as my thoughts. By nine o‚Äôclock that night, I was already tired, my muscles too taut to relax. I felt like a dancer in a music box with her key being twisted every minute, her spring so far past tight that one more twist would snap it, shattering her.

At ten o‚Äôclock, I nearly blacked out from fear, my eyes dry and tired. When I first knew I had to play, my normal sleep pattern stopped. I had been up for three nights, with an hour nap on the bus in between. That wasn‚Äôt smart, but neither was what I would do in a few hours. At least on the bus the threat was something I could probably deal with. I looked at the wooden door, and my supplies on the small stand next to it. I knew I couldn‚Äôt deal with what had to be done. What I had done to force myself into playing this game. In all honestly, I hadn‚Äôt been sleeping well for a lot longer than three nights.

At eleven I started to shake. I couldn‚Äôt take the anticipation. My body couldn‚Äôt comprehend the threat, but knew something was wrong, something was happening, and I couldn‚Äôt handle the pressure. Every time I paced in front of the door, my foot hitting the one creaking floorboard near the top step, stars clouded my vision.

At eleven thirty, I began to sweat, beads rolling down my skin, covering me in a shroud of discomfort. I paced faster and faster as the grandfather clock in the living room ticked out each second; the only sound in the emptiness of my little house. Every time I turned towards the kitchen I could see the night out of my back door. It was too opaque, the glass looked as if someone painted it black, but I felt as if someone was out there in that inky color, just waiting for the game to begin.

At a quarter to, I gave my repetitive movements a purpose, and went from room to room, making sure every door and window was locked, and that every single light was out, bathing the house in a deeper darkness to match the outside. At ten minutes to, I turned the kitchen light off and sat in front of the basement door with my supplies beside me.¬†

When I was little, and couldn‚Äôt sleep, I‚Äôd hide in my closest tucked behind a deflated kickball and old snow boots. I would close the door, the silence and darkness complete, comfortably wrapping itself around me. I was such a light sleeper, the cars rumbling down the alley were too loud, and the streetlamp on the corner streamed into my bedroom window, illuminating everything. I would try to force my eyes closed and forget about the outside sounds, but I couldn‚Äôt hold them shut for long. So I would sit in the vacuum of my closet, with my eyes wide and staring, not seeing a thing. They would grow heavy soon enough, the cancellation of the world calming me down, letting me rest. I tried to calm down in front of that door but I knew I was dangling by a thread, time running out. Nothing could distract me long enough to relax, but I stared anyway, knowing fully well that it could be the last time I would sit alone in the dark.

When I checked my watch again, and saw I had less than five minutes to midnight, I broke from my tenuous reverie. My hands shook as my heart beat faster than I thought it could, but as I lit one of the candles, and readied a small knife that used to be my mother‚Äôs, I could feel my thoughts sharpening. ‚ÄúI will survive tonight,‚Äù I whispered over and over again, a meditative mantra on loop in the back of my head as I took a pencil, and wrote my name on piece of paper. ‚ÄúMargret Alice Andrews,‚Äù it read in a cursive print that would make any calligrapher jealous.

I was named for my grandmothers, both dead, but more like me than I would ever fully understand. I hesitated only once before pricking my pointer finger with Ma‚Äôs knife, letting a few drops fall on my name. I placed the candle on top of it, and made sure I put my knife on the stand with the backup supplies before putting my main lighter, and book of matches in my jean pockets. I slowly stood up, kept an eye on my watch to make sure I timed everything correctly, and then started to knock.

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,

My knocks didn‚Äôt reverberate through the silence like I thought they would. They sounded close, immediate, so near I wanted to cry.

7, 8, 9, 10, 11,

Halfway there, and I didn‚Äôt think I could do it anymore, My insides matching my outside, and by shaking and breaking down.

12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,

I thought I could hear a noise at the bottom of the basement stairs. It was a soft, but noticeable footfall on the bottom step,

18,

And on the next step,

19,

And on the next three,

20,¬†

The next five,

21,

The next six,

22.

The grandfather clock chimed the hour, and even though I was prepared for this sudden shock of noise, my knees buckled out from under me. I caught myself on the door before falling completely, my head so close to the basement door that I could hear every noise on the other side of the thin wood. He was on the top step, his breath labored, the sounds of a mouth, or a maw, opening and closing with sickly stickiness. I knew he was not breathing so heavily from exhaustion. I steadied myself then, anger and fear welling into determination. I pulled open the door to the black opaqueness of night and nothing else. I saw no one. I waited, and in a few seconds that seemed so slow because of the adrenaline pumping in my veins, the candle blew out in front of me, the door slamming shut in my face. He was in. The game was on.

In a split second, I grabbed the candle from the floor, relit it faster than I thought possible, and scooped up the carton of salt. I then bounded up my living room stairs situated near my basement door, and onto the second floor, making a bee-line to my room, closing and locking the door behind me. Next to my living room, the master bedroom was the biggest in the house, and included a master bathroom, which made up the entirety of the second floor besides one stuffy storage room at the end of the hall. Earlier that day, I threw a case of water bottles and a few bags of snacks in the bedroom making it my unofficial base of operations.

I had until 3:33am for him to leave, so long term preparation was key. I knew he would come up at any time, be it an hour or a few seconds, time meaning so much and so little to a being like him, but I planned to always come back to my room wherever he tried to get me. It was my safe zone. Or so I hoped. In my scared haze, I accidentally stepped on my cat‚Äôs bed that was next to my own, and felt a sense of relief that my Little One, an orange tabby, was safe at my mother‚Äôs house far away from the thing stalking me in the dark. I sat gingerly on my bed, placing the carton of salt on my nightstand, eyes glued to door. My heart didn‚Äôt calm, but went faster, my thoughts centered on the present moment. All I could do was stare, barely blinking, barely breathing. I could feel my throat going dry, but didn‚Äôt have the courage to move towards the case of water just left of me, next to the closet door. My fear stuck me to the bed, and I had to repress the feeling of hiding under the blankets.

I couldn‚Äôt believe that I made it so far already. While I always loved the occult, it found a way to send a shiver up my spine when I thought about anything out of my plane of existence. It was so tenuous, so easy to screw up, especially with magic. One missed step in a spell to attract love could turn into a spell to hurt someone you love. And those things that could hurt you were much worse compared to humans. Humans could lack consciences, but the thing I let into my home lacked a soul.

Like magic, there were certain rules to the game I was forced to play, and when the window behind me started to crack, ice creeping up its surface, and every other item in the room, I knew he was near. My candle flickered once, twice, and gutted out on the third, the sound of someone blowing it out echoing in my head. I had ten seconds to relight it. I panicked. The long wait left me dazed, not in control of the body that unwound itself without my knowledge as I focused on the door. It felt like I wasn‚Äôt attached to it anymore, my head moving faster than my hands. My thumb was useless rubber as I tried to turn the spark wheel on the lighter. I couldn‚Äôt do it. My covers started to frost over, and I could see my own breath, but my hand couldn‚Äôt start a flame. My floorboards creaked, either from the cold or the man who walked on them, invisible to my eye, but I still couldn‚Äôt light it.

I shot up, and with my legs turned to stilts, I tripped on my Little One‚Äôs bed this time, and fell to the icy floor. The candle and lighter both fell out of my hands. I managed to grab the candle before it rolled out of my reach, but the lighter was forever lost, and my backup was on the stand next to the basement door. I took the book of matches from my pocket, freezing cold seconds turning to hours. The creaks got louder, sounding more and more like fevered steps. I ripped out at match, folded the book and struck it, the light coming to life. I lit the candle once more, and the floor around it immediately melted, the temperature returning to normal. The door to the bedroom flew open and slammed back so hard that it released from its hinges, and fell to the floor. I could hear a grinding growl reverberate as he ran down the hall.

I was playing by the rules, and he was getting mad. The next time wouldn‚Äôt be so easy. I got to my halting feet, and picked the candle up with still cold fingers. My body finally caught up with my brain, so I grabbed the salt and ran downstairs, giving up on the first lighter. The stand next to the basement door was knocked over. When I looked down to find my backup lighter, I saw that the paper with my given name and blood on it was burned to nothing but ashes that didn‚Äôt even smolder. I found the other lighter underneath the mess, and taking my two other candles off the floor as well, but leaving the knife since it was useless against a threat like him, I crossed back to the living room, an open space in full view of the stairs that lead up to the second floor.

I went to a chair in the corner that gave me the best view of the landing, and the clock. It was a few minutes after one. After a while of sitting on the comfy chair, the clock‚Äôs rhythmic tick tock steadied my own beating heart, and I found my body was relaxing again, each muscle loosening as if on command. The tension I built within myself was just too much, and I couldn‚Äôt keep it going all night. My mind felt it too, heaviness seeping up into my neck, bending my head, and relaxing my eyes. It was an intoxicating feeling of utter release, pure euphoria. I moved my eyes to the candle on my lap that tipped more and more as I felt lighter and lighter. The hot wax dripped onto my bare thighs, but it didn‚Äôt bother me. When it fell to the floor with an audible thunk, I closed my eyes at last, giving myself over to the sound of the clock.

The next thing I remember was my body falling. I woke up suddenly, jerking myself upright. The candle next to my feet was out, and not smoking. I looked at the clock. It felt like hours since I closed my eyes. It felt like seconds. It was a minute. A full minute. I broke the rules, and my heart dipped to the floor with the life of the candle. All was quiet, but that was the most deceiving thing of all. ‚ÄúHe wouldn‚Äôt leave me alone,‚Äù I thought. There was no way.¬†

I picked the candle up, and relit it with the extra lighter. I lit the other two as well, and placed them on the coffee table a few inches in front of me. I got up and pushed the table towards the front window, creating a large enough space in between the TV and the sofa. I took my salt next, and methodically made a thick circle of the stuff around me. Then I placed the two back up candles next to the circle, grabbed my original candle, threw the empty carton of salt on the couch, and sat down in the center of my protective circle.

I was sweating and shaking again, my mind pulling apart from the stress. I rocked in the middle of the salt circle thinking to myself: ‚ÄúIf he gets me, he‚Äôll take me, bit by bit. If he gets me, he‚Äôll take me, bit by bit.‚Äù My mother warned me that he had tricks to do this, that when he was mad, when he saw that I could handle myself, he‚Äôd find a way. ‚ÄúIf he gets me, he‚Äôll take me, bit by bit.‚Äù The clock chimed the half hour, and went through me like lightening. I could only rock more, my body becoming a tight ball of anticipation.

At two in the morning, the clock struck again, and I shook like I would never be warm again. If I played by the rules, I would be free of him at 3:33am, but because I fell asleep‚Ä¶I didn‚Äôt want to think what was brewing because of my mistake, and I wasn‚Äôt naive enough to think he left.

Even if I made it through the night, The Midnight Man, as Ma called him, would never leave me. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôll be in your dreams, Baby. Always there.‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt even think that far ahead while rocking away another wave of fear and nausea. I didn‚Äôt know how long it would take, but he would be there. He‚Äôd play his final card, finishing the game any way he could. When I heard a cat scream from the kitchen, I knew he found his ace.

The wails were my Little One. Loud, screeching howls that made my stomach hollow, and filled my throat with bile. They weren‚Äôt the sounds my safe, happy cat made when she purred next to me in bed all night. They were long and torturous. Whatever was happening to the tiny creature was killing it, and I swear I could feel my cat‚Äôs pain in every inch of her failing body, but if I moved from that circle he would take me, bit by bit. When I heard a tearing sound like wet paper, and the smell of blood started to waft through the living room, I threw up.

Nothing but the heavy liquid sticking to my throat came out. In the candle light it looked too dark, not bile at all, but thick and viscous. I gasped and coughed up the mess for at least a full minute, and with one final push it all came out, a river of sick that dissolved the salt in front of me. When I could breathe again, wiping the tears from my eyes, I almost threw up whatever was left inside because my purge was covered in mats of orange tabby fur.

I screamed and ran with my first candle, making my way to the stairs only to stop again. My lungs froze, breaths coming out in quick puffs as I stared at the nothingness in front of me. I knew he was on the landing. I could feel a vibration that started at my toes and slowly climbed up my spine, but I couldn‚Äôt see him. All I saw were two family portraits hanging in dark frames at the top of the stairs and nothing more. Trying to push past this new anxiety, I started up the stairs to get back to my safe haven. Unfortunately, my first instinct was correct. A tall form materialized from the pictures, his outline, the color the frames behind him. He was there but not, his indistinct body shifting to match the color of my walls, and the smiling faces of a photo taken at some family event in the past. He growled again, low and guttural, a sound so deep and vicious it felt its way through the soles of my feet, sticking me to the bottom of the stairs with nowhere to run.

When I saw him for what he was, I suddenly remembered that my Little One was with my mother. Safe. I pulled my eyes away from him to look back at my ruined salt circle, but it was still intact. The two other candles were still flickering around it, my vomit nonexistent. Without turning back to the snarling trickster, I ran to the last place I could go, the basement. He pursued me, loping down the stairs, his anger so great that there was no subtlety left to give me the creeps. He was all rage, all fire. He bounded down wooden stairs that splintered with each step. He tore my other picture frames down off the wall in a tumble of glass, ripping the photographs I once took myself. He kicked through the front door at the bottom of the stairs, before rounding onto the living room.

I started stepping down to the basement as he ripped through the room like a tornado, destroying my circle, and everything else, once and for all. The sound of his snarls and destruction nearly sent me head long down the stairs but I was able to steady myself. I ended up missing the last stair though, and fell to the concrete basement with a bang. I landed hard on my knees, but made sure to hold out the candle in front of me. ‚ÄúYou can only go down from here.‚Äù fluttered briefly through my mind. I looked at my watch by the light of the flame, and knew it was over. I had a half an hour to go with nowhere to run. I started to cry in chest bursting sobs, the thought of my inevitable death overwhelming. I always knew that there was a chance I wouldn‚Äôt make it, but I pushed that thought far away from my consciousness, leaving my nightmares to make up for it in spades. Nothing compared though to the moment I finally understood that I lost the Midnight Game.

I dared to look up at the top of the stairs. I could barely see his heaving nebulous form at the doorway, a dark shadow waiting to overtake me completely. ‚ÄúHe will take me bit by bit.‚Äù He came down the stairs much slower than when he came up, taking his time, relishing the moment I would unequivocally be his, but as he made his way down his form shifted and changed again, getting shorter, thinner, and more solid. His breathing slowed too, and sounded higher than before, not like a man‚Äôs. On the last six steps I smelled rosewater, and I stared in awe from the dirty concrete floor of my basement as my Grandma Alice came down to meet me.

She smiled at me the way she always used to, and bending like she was going to kiss me on the head, Grandma Alice blew out my candle, leaving me in the darkness.

\*\*\*

When I came to, it was still dark, and the only thing I could hear was my heart beating in my ears. I trembled all over, and was still covered in a sheen of sweat. It took me a while to get the courage to hit the button on my watch to check the time. If he was still in my house, I would be breaking another rule by using an unnatural light source. I hoped and prayed as the watch lit up. 3:34 am. I laughed out of shock. Sputtering and coughing, I pushed myself up to a sitting position, the dead candle falling from my hands. I started to cry again.

‚ÄúI shouldn‚Äôt be alive.‚Äù I said, finally breaking the unnatural silence. My relief over that fact turned to guilt, and as I sobbed, I thought of Grandma Alice. My grandmother was always full of magic. It ran in the family. They all practiced it in her home, but she would tell me that I was especially gifted. My magic was strong and precise, learning from youth that one small mistake could cost a huge price.

That is until I messed up on a spell for love. A spell built out of an obsession for a man who didn‚Äôt belong to me, if I‚Äôm being honest. I was lonely and blinded, and all it took was one overlooked fact, one missed step, and the price was my grandmother‚Äôs life for a spell that didn‚Äôt even work. It had been two months to the day when my family coven told me that I had to play the game. My punishment for carelessness, and for wanting something I shouldn‚Äôt have. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs only fair, baby. A life for a life.‚Äù my mother told me when she picked up Little One‚Äôs carrier the day before I played the game. I cried even harder, but the relief of getting that man out of my house was too much to take sitting down.

I stood up and my legs were beyond stiff. Even in the pitch black, I figured I was still at the bottom of the stairs on the basement. In the excitement and pain of winning the Midnight Game, I took a step to start walking up the stairs, but as I did I heard an all too familiar creak. Before I realized what happened I stepped down hard on my large white candle that pushed itself out from under my waiting foot. I slipped and fell backwards. I miscalculated again. Instead of being at the bottom of the stairs, I was left at the top, on the floor leading into my kitchen, the open door and flight of steps behind me. I fell fast, hitting the first step,

The next step,¬†

The next three,

The next five,

The next six,

And landed on the concrete bottom, blacking out entirely.

\*\*\*

I only learned what happened next when my mother was willing to tell me what she saw through fits of sobs. Ma used my extra key to let herself into my home with cat carrier in hand. The long haired tabby let out a soft mew, sniffing the familiar scent of her home when they entered the living room. Ma sucked in her breath when she saw the circle of salt on the floor, and the two burnt out candles surrounding it. She put the cat down immediately, and ran up the stairs where my photographs hung neatly on the wall, the two at the top group shots from a recent family reunion.

She went straight to the bedroom and opened the door, finding everything in order, but I was nowhere to be found. She checked the adjacent bathroom, and storage room before flying back downstairs, her heart running faster than her feet. The tabby cat was growing as frantic as my mother, clawing at the carrier to be let out, but Ma was too nervous to release the Little One, and could only run to the kitchen, and down to the basement without any luck besides a fallen table and her old ceremonial knife.

She started crying in panic as she searched the first floor once more, groaning out my name with no luck. She finally let the cat out of her carrier as she grew hysterical. Little One bolted up the stairs, yowling all the while. Ma followed the cat as fast as she could. The cat skittered right past the open door of my bedroom and straight to my bedroom closet, scratching wildly at the door. Ma ran over to the Little One, and putting her ear to the closet door, she heard a soft moan come from inside. She pushed aside the case of water that was against it, and opened the door to find me, tucked behind my snow boots, my eyes wide open, my brain in shambles, and my legs twisted and contorted at odd angles.

I was rushed to the hospital, but it was too late. my legs were beyond repair, torn and smashed nearly to a pulp, and needed to be amputated before an infection set in. I don‚Äôt turn my lights off anymore, and haven‚Äôt thought of using magic since. Even through the glare of the lamp on my nightstand though, he‚Äôs still there, composing himself from the slick wooden floor next to my bed and from the slats of my closet door. He hides behind my eyes and I know no peace. What I do know now is that I will never skip a step, break a rule, and I will never play a game with the Midnight Man ever again.

1l7s21x,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalkTherapy/comments/1l7s21x/falling_for_my_therapist/,Falling for my therapist,"Yes, another transference post. I am using a throwaway in case my therapist reads this. I am also going to obfuscate a few facts. 

I have been seeing my therapist for almost 2 years now. I am a married mid-40s man. She is also married and my age. She has been a therapist for many years now, but she is still an associate because she had a few career changes along the way. She still works under supervision, although she is almost at her hours if not over.  

I liked her right from the start. She is very kind and provides a safe space. She and I also have a sort of connection. Sharing with her is effortless for me. I have told her things I have never told anyone else because I trust her so much. Sometimes she disclosed to me, too, which at the time I appreciated because it helped us bond and made the relationship feel more real and less like talking to a detached clinician but now I see why this is generally a bad idea.  

A few months in we had a talk about boundaries and how we could never, ever, ever see each other outside of therapy in any setting - not even for coffee. The context was that some day our relationship would end and she wanted to be sure I am building up the support I need outside of her instead of relying solely on her. That made sense to me and at the time I was fine with it. I had no desire to see her outside of session anyway. 

Over time, though, we have gotten closer. We happen to have a lot in common. We grew up in the same town. We share the same sense of humor and laugh a lot. I realize I am now attracted to her physically where I really wasn't before. I mean, she has always been pretty, but I see her in a totally different way now. I enjoy being in her presence. I look forward to sessions. I wonder what she is going to wear. Sometimes she dresses very casually and sometimes she is extremely dressed up. I am curious what precipitates the decision and like guessing which version of her I am going to get: the sexy bombshell, the college girl, the frazzled mom. 

When discussing my marriage, which is failing miserably, and how it is impacting me she has shared struggles in her marriage as well. She mentioned a couple of things her husband does that deeply upset her. She doesn't share very much or very often, but when she does it makes me feel so special.  One time she told me: ""I know this is your time and I want to respect that. I only disclose to you because I feel like you would understand and I know you can handle it"" and I wanted to tell her how very, very wrong she was about that. I do understand, but I am not handling it unless handling it means wanting to take her in my arms and hold her. 

One time she very casually called me ""honey"" (and she is not the type who just says things like that all the time like a Southern waitress) when she touched my hand, which was the only time we have ever touched in any way. It had me walking on air all week. Same when she complimented an outfit I was wearing. I never get compliments from anyone. I don't know if she is just trying to build me up, but if so it is working. 

I shared with her that I understand that our boundary needs to be maintained but that I care for her and she said she cares about me, too. She's told me many times that she admires me. She seems so genuine, which is why I chose her to begin with. There isn't anything fake about her. 

Her advice has been really good and she has helped me a lot. I was in a deep depression when I met her and unsure about what I wanted out of life. I am figuring things out. However, I am afraid that I am getting attached to her and not only in a patient-therapist way. I have considered telling her that I need to stop seeing her, because I only see this ending in heartbreak for me. Either she is just being really nice and I am a fool that she will be forced to slap down hard which will be really painful or else she has feelings, too, and then what? We are going to divorce our spouses and run away together? That's not going to happen. I am realistic about that. I just wish we could see each other outside of session and really talk. I feel like I would get a lot out of that. I suspect she might, too, which is why the focus needs to stay on me in session since I am the paying client. I respect that. I have paid for extra long sessions, which she said she always enjoys, and I could easily talk to her for 3-4-5 hours if I could. I want to know so much more about her. 

She once told me that her job is to supply the things that are missing in my relationships so that I can understand what healthy relationships feel like and go seek those out. She treats me well and validates my feelings and it has helped me figure out what I want out of my romantic relationships.¬†However, I am starting to seek out her approval which could interfere with the therapy. I told her something about myself I was ashamed of and she said ""I am not sure if you care about this, but I want you to know that I don't think any less of you for sharing that."" It was such a relief to hear that from her, but what if I had let her down? I probably shouldn't be worried about how I am coming off to her. 

I am definitely NOT going to tell her this. At least not yet. I don't want to lose the only safe space I have in my life. I keep hoping maybe it will pass and sometimes it does for a few sessions, but then it comes roaring back. I really want to sit down and get to know her a lot better but there are of course so many obstacles to that: professional, ethical, moral - and that is IF she is interested in the same. She probably isn't looking to blow up her marriage and lose her license. I'm actually not that interesting. I just help her pass time and pay her bills. What a mess I got myself into.

So, I spent time with my ex on his birthday, and when we went out to this cute ice cream/coffee bar, he wrote our initials inside a heart. It honestly made me so happy‚Äîit felt like something out of a movie. Me being the hopeless romantic I am, I took it as a sign that maybe we were getting back together. When we got back to his place, it really felt like we were two people falling in love all over again. I‚Äôm still completely in love with him.

Before this, we were stuck in a situationship, constantly in this weird limbo. But that night, after he wrote our initials, we had a real conversation. He told me he loved me and admitted that trying again is scary because we‚Äôve both been hurt before. I told him I knew it wouldn‚Äôt be easy and that fixing what we had wasn‚Äôt going to happen overnight‚Äîbut I believed it would be worth it because I love him. And he agreed. He said we could try again slowly.

I ended up staying the weekend with him. But a day or two later, everything changed. He suddenly claimed none of it meant anything and said he didn‚Äôt remember the conversation we had about giving our relationship another shot. That completely crushed me.

A big detail here: he only said all that after finding out my friends had tried to set me up on a date during the time he had me blocked‚Äîback when we were in that confusing, undefined space. I tried explaining the situation to him, but instead of listening, he blamed my friends for tearing us apart. But all they were trying to do was help me move on, especially since things were so uncertain between us.

Now, I just feel really lost and heartbroken. I love him deeply, but I don't know if I'm overreacting or if my feelings are valid. I keep wondering what I should do next?

Set in a small town, small population 

Benny rolls up to friends house a bit disheveled and sweaty and his friends all ask him what happened? Didn‚Äôt he have a date tonight? 

some scenes of the town and the local diner pass through as the first lines are playing but a little muffled and echoey 

On the first run a blonde girl with a lot of glam is in a rush to get ready and runs out the door

Benny gets to a old timey looking diner wearing a corny 80s cowboy like button down, he sits down in the booth

In slow motion you see the body (but not face) of a waitress in a cute little uniform with some roller skates, heading toward him with a set of fries

Cut to Benny turning his head and he recognizes her, his eyes go wide

She proceeds to drop the fries off at the table directly in front of him and you finally see her face, recognizing him too. 

It cuts to Benny and her just staring at each other for a moment as he sings the chorus ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm here for someone else, it‚Äôs good to see your face and I really hope you‚Äôre doing well‚Äù 

The next line when he says ‚Äúwish I could stay and we could talk at the bar all by ourselves ‚Äú is a fantasy montage of them at the bar with milkshakes talking close to each other 

Then it‚Äôs snaps back to reality, the waitress is taking the order of the table in front of him and the blonde walks in and starts looking around, Benny takes one look at her and puts the menu up in front of his face to hide for a moment as he deliberates leaving. 

 Cut to Benny with his friends for a moment as they say ‚Äúwhat happens next??‚Äù 

Then again in slow motion he starts to get up with the menu in front of his face as he sings ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry I need to go it‚Äôs not personal‚Äù 

Then for the next couple lines of chorus he just dances and sings around the restaurant and maybe the other people are frozen while he sings around them, pouring people coffee refills and taking orders out the window then ringing the little bell

Then when the last lines start he‚Äôs running into the kitchen, bumping into cooks and waiters causing a spill and on the last note he‚Äôs bursting through the back door into the alley way panting and looking for which way he can run to his car and proceeds to run away. 

The end.

We have previously dated in high school where he then cheated on me. For the last 3 years I‚Äôve been debating on and off if I should reach out to him and I recently chucked it in the fuck it bucket and did it. He was very surprised that I texted him in the first place and tbh I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd have the guts to do it. He responded a couple minutes after he saw it cause he was in shock. After talking for about 2 days I decided to ask him if he wanted to hangout. He agreed and the day after I asked him, we hung out in a public park. We met to get coffee and then walked to the park. We were both nervous but that‚Äôs normal‚Ä¶.right? 

ANYWAY, since 3 years ago he‚Äôs gotten a job, a car, developed manners towards his family (thank god) and seems to have turned his life around. That same day we hung out, the northern lights were supposed to be showing at midnight. So we stayed out, got chipotle, and then went to this lookout in Portland. Needless to say, we didn‚Äôt see no damn lightsüòÇ. But while we were out there I asked him about what had happened in the past and I had explicitly told him ‚ÄúI am not mad at you, I have forgiven you and whatever answer you give me, does not mean anything. It‚Äôs just for my peace of mind and curiosity.‚Äù so I ask him if what I thought happened (him cheating) was what actually happened and he then looked at the ground, his smile went away, and he kind of shook his head and goes ‚Äúyeah‚Äù so then I tell him ‚Äúit‚Äôs ok. I forgive you and I‚Äôve gotten over it‚Äù. Then I ask him if he regretted/regrets it, he says yes and that I didn‚Äôt/don‚Äôt deserve that. 

Since reaching out to him he has made it so very clear that he will never do that again and that I deserve better. I agree with him cause in my personal opinion, no one deserves to get cheated on. It‚Äôs a really shitty thing to do. Cause why get into a relationship and commit to one person if you‚Äôre just gonna go behind their back and betray them? In this 2nd try to make things work, he‚Äôs made me feel like a 13 year old girl talking to her crush for the first time. He‚Äôs so loving, caring, kind, etc.

After seeing some brilliant posts and thoughtful feedback on here, I thought I‚Äôd share where we‚Äôre up to with our living and dining space and get your thoughts.

I‚Äôve included some before and after pics. This is our first home, so we had the luxury of decorating before buying any furniture, and we‚Äôve taken our time to try and get it right. So far we‚Äôre really happy with the progress. The walls and furniture are all sorted, and now we just want to make it feel warmer and more ‚Äúus‚Äù.

Here‚Äôs where we‚Äôre at and what we‚Äôre still unsure on.

‚Ä¢ We‚Äôre considering sheer curtains for the back window (the privacy film is just a temporary fix), possibly layered with burnt orange curtains. Open to colour suggestions.

‚Ä¢ We originally planned a big rectangular rug under the sofa, but it‚Äôs a pull-out with a footrest, so we‚Äôd need something quite thin. Now we‚Äôre thinking a round rug that just pokes out from underneath, echoing the spiral staircase and round lamps.

‚Ä¢ We‚Äôve got a bench on one side of the dining table, but just two very temporary bistro chairs for now. Would love ideas for something comfier that still fits the space. We were possibly thinking a denim blue or a mustard yellow (or both)

‚Ä¢ We really wanted a coffee table, but with the pull-out sofa we‚Äôre now thinking side tables or maybe a narrow sideboard would work better for our morning coffees.

‚Ä¢ We‚Äôve got a few plants and lamps that still need proper homes. Maybe some tiered stands or shelves.

‚Ä¢ We definitely need something to give the walls more personality. We‚Äôre thinking a mix of artwork, mirrors or shelving, but we‚Äôre not sure where to start.

‚Ä¢ We really love what we‚Äôve done so far, but would massively appreciate any ideas for how to finish the space off. Unless your advice is ‚Äúscrap the whole thing‚Äù in which case, straight in the bin with you üòÖ

## Key Features Analysis

The selection process for the best tin candles of 2025 involves careful consideration of several key features that determine their overall quality and performance.

 **Wax Type:** The type of wax used significantly impacts the candle's burn time, scent throw, and environmental impact.Soy wax, known for its clean burn and excellent scent throw, is a preferred choice.Paraffin wax, while more common, can produce soot and has a less lasting profile. Beeswax offers a natural option with a subtle honey scent and long burn time.

 The choice of wax heavily influences the overall experience of the candle. Soy wax, derived from soybeans, is biodegradable and burns cleaner with less soot compared to paraffin. Beeswax, a natural wax produced by bees, offers a subtle honey aroma and is also known for air-purifying properties. Paraffin, a petroleum byproduct, is less expensive but can release toxins when burned.

 **Scent Profile:** A well-crafted scent is crucial for any candle. The best tin candles use high-quality fragrance oils or essential oils that create a balanced and long-lasting aroma. Scent profiles can range from fresh and citrusy to warm and spicy, catering to various preferences and occasions.

 The complexity and authenticity of the scent play a vital role in the candle's appeal. Top-tier tin candles use concentrated fragrance oils or natural essential oils to deliver a nuanced and enduring aroma. A good scent profile evolves over time, releasing different notes as the candle burns, creating a richer olfactory experience.

 **Burn Time:** Burn time is a practical consideration, indicating how long the candle will last with regular use. Tin candles typically offer burn times ranging from 20 to 50 hours,depending on the wax type,size,and wick quality. A longer burn time provides better value and reduces the need for frequent replacements.

 A longer burn time translates to greater value for consumers. Factors that influence burn time include the size of the tin, the type of wax used, and the wick composition. Reputable manufacturers conduct burn tests to estimate the candle's lifespan accurately, providing consumers with a reliable expectation for usage.

 **Wick Material:** The wick material affects how cleanly and evenly the candle burns. Cotton wicks are a common choice, but wooden wicks are gaining popularity for their crackling sound and even burn. the wick should be properly sized for the tin's diameter to prevent tunneling or excessive smoking.

 The wick's material and size are critical for optimal performance. Cotton wicks, available in various thicknesses, ensure consistent fuel delivery to the flame. Wooden wicks provide a distinct sensory experience with a gentle crackling sound, reminiscent of a fireplace. The wick's size needs to be proportionate to the candle's diameter to prevent uneven burning or excessive smoke.

 **Tin Design & Material:** The tin's design contributes to the candle's overall aesthetic and functionality.Durable and heat-resistant materials,such as seamless tinplate,are essential for safety and longevity. The design can range from minimalist and modern to ornate and decorative, reflecting the brand's style and target audience.

 The tin's design is not merely aesthetic; it serves a functional purpose as well. High-quality tinplate, often seamless, prevents leaks and withstands the heat generated by the burning candle.The design can vary from minimalist and understated to elaborate and decorative, aligning with the brand's image and appealing to different consumer tastes.

## FAQs section

**How do I prevent tunneling in my tin candle?**

**are tin candles safe to use?**
Yes, tin candles are generally safe when used properly. Always burn them on a heat-resistant surface, away from flammable materials, and never leave them unattended. Ensure the tin is made of heat-resistant material to prevent overheating.

I couldn‚Äôt believe it‚Äîthe very first thing he told me was such devastating news. It felt like my entire world crumbled in an instant. Iona was only four years old, and her fifth birthday was just weeks away.

The attack that happened in the early hours of this morning turned everything upside down, shattering everything I‚Äôd worked so hard to protect for so long. It was chaos, pure and utter chaos, and now the cost was far greater than I could have ever imagined.

The most painful part of all this suffering was when Nathaniel ignored me as I lay helpless on the ground with Iona, both of us barely clinging to life while trying to escape. He was too preoccupied helping Yoan and her son, Dane.

Yoan and Nathaniel had been childhood friends, their bond running deep long before Nathaniel even met me.

When he found me gravely injured and Iona unconscious, trapped beneath the rubble of the packhouse, he chose to turn away. He merely called for members of the Pack Medical Centre before focusing his attention elsewhere.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs only fainted and in shock, Yoan. Let‚Äôs check on your son first‚Äîhe‚Äôs in worse condition,‚Äù he had said at the time.

Nathaniel‚Äôs words still ring in my ears, their indifference cutting deeper than the wounds on my body. To him, Iona was simply unconscious, nothing to worry about. But now, as she lies lifeless before me, I can‚Äôt understand how he could've dismissed her so easily.

I sat sobbing in the corner of the room, my body trembling, utterly drained of strength. It felt as though every ounce of energy I once had had vanished, leaving me as nothing more than an empty shell. Iona‚Äôs small body lay motionless on the bed, her once-cheerful face now eerily serene, as though she were merely sleeping.

But I knew the truth‚Äîand it shattered me in ways I could never have imagined.

Both my hands gripped the edge of the table beside me, desperate for something to steady myself, to pull me back to my feet. But there was nothing strong enough to hold against the relentless waves of pain crashing over me. Tears streamed down my face in an endless flow, blurring my vision.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs only fainted, just in shock,‚Äù his voice echoed in my mind, cruel and dismissive, like a taunt that refused to fade.

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt do this,‚Äù I whispered, my voice trembling, barely audible. My hand reached out towards Iona‚Äôs small, lifeless body, but I froze just before touching her. I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to face the truth‚Äîthat her delicate form was now as cold as the dark of night.

And then, the bitter realisation struck me, Nathaniel‚Äôs attention no longer belonged to his wife and child. It was now consumed by his Yoan and her son. At that moment, it became painfully clear that the marriage I had once been so proud of was nothing more than a cruel illusion, a lie I had foolishly clung to.

Nathaniel‚Äôs loyalty has always been painfully biased, and I can‚Äôt endure it any longer. My foolishness has cost me Iona, and now she‚Äôs gone forever.

Once the healer finished treating my injuries, they dressed Iona in a pristine white gown and gently placed her in a coffin. I followed as they prepared to take her to the morgue, my legs heavy with grief.

Before the burial, I planned to tell Nathaniel everything. But first, I needed to make a call.

The number I'd blocked for years, I unblocked. The monotone ring tone greeted me, once, twice, three times, then a deep voice answered.

""Angelina?""

""Hello, Alpha Malcolm... I... I've finally come to a decision about your offer.""

""You've agreed, Angie?"" The happiness in his voice made it clear he was beaming on the other end of the line.

""Yes, I had decided to return to my pack and help them with their agricultural efforts, which had been lagging. I would be leaving Nathaniel as soon as possible.""

However, as I and the few cars accompanying Iona's hearse arrived at the Black Widow Pack, Nathaniel caught up to me. His face was etched with deep sadness.

""Angie, please,"" he begged, his voice cracking with a vulnerability I'd never heard before. ""Come back to the Pearl Harbor Pack. We can fix this. I can fix it.""

I stared at him, the man I'd once loved with all my heart, and knew there was no going back. The bridge was burned, the chasm too wide.

""No way,"" I spat, the fire of my pain blazing in my chest. ""You made your choice, Nathaniel. And now, I'm making mine.""

‚Äî‚Äî

Yesterday's attack had ripped through the Pearl Harbor Pack, leaving chaos and devastation in its wake. The damage was so extensive, so profound, that none of us found peace afterward, least of all me. As Luna, I was expected to be a beacon of strength, a pillar of resilience. But how could I when I had just lost my precious four-year-old daughter, Iona?

The pain was numbing, a heavy weight pressing down on my chest. The blood loss and broken bones, the physical reminders of the attack, drained me of any tears. I was too exhausted, too shattered, to even cry.

I lay alone on our bed, staring at the blank ceiling, whispering to myself, ""That's too far.""

My whole body ached, my very soul felt bruised, but no matter how much I suffered, Nathaniel didn't seem to care. He didn't even ask about Iona. He was too busy overseeing the repairs to the pack houses and keeping Yoan company at the hospital.

Now I was starting to wonder if Nathaniel was really that busy, so busy that he could ignore me and Iona, even after Iona had passed.

I had thought that after the attack, after he'd heard about the two deep slashes I'd received and the bone fracture in my leg from the collapsing building that the enemy had set ablaze, Nathaniel would realize how much Iona and I had suffered. But I was wrong. He hadn't been home since he'd said he was going to oversee the repairs to the buildings that had been burned by the enemy.

I huddled in bed alone, feeling the excruciating pain of my wounds.

I curled up in bed, aching for the one thing I needed most: him. But what I got instead was silence.

Exhausted from the weight of it all, I fell into a restless sleep.

When I woke the next morning, the bedroom door was ajar, and for a moment, I thought I was dreaming.

But then Nathaniel walked in, towel wrapped around his waist, tapping away on his mobile as if I didn't exist.

""Nathaniel, when did you come home?"" I asked, leaning against the headboard, still feeling the lingering fatigue in my bones.

""Just now,"" he muttered without lifting his gaze.

I swallowed hard and whispered hoarsely, ""Will you be returning to the office?""

Nathaniel remained silent, not raising his head, entirely absorbed by his mobile phone. Yet, moments later, he growled harshly, ""I am the pack leader. After that attack, I must manage everything without pause, unlike you who can sleep whilst others lie critically wounded beyond our doors.""

""How dare you‚Äî""



Chapter 2

""Rather than complaining incessantly, you'd do better preparing my breakfast,"" he interrupted.

I clenched my jaw and tightened my fists. I desperately wanted to slap him repeatedly and make him understand that his daughter Iona was more than just 'critically wounded'. I wanted to make him realise he had lost his own daughter through his selfish prioritisation of Hazel, Yona's son.

I clenched my jaw, restraining the biting response that trembled on my lips.

He had been like this recently‚Äîdistant, acerbic, perpetually absent, even when physically present. So, I turned silently and made my way to the kitchen.

Even as I stirred the spaghetti I was making, my thoughts kept drifting to Yoan and his son, Hazel. Was Yoan with Nathaniel all day? Did he sleep over at Yoan's? Did he love Hazel even more than Nathaniel should love Iona? But I tried to push those feelings aside and think more positively. After breakfast was ready, Nathaniel joined me at the table but he was always on his phone.

I stayed quiet, knowing there was no point in starting a conversation. His reply would probably be short and painful.

""We've investigated the attack from the early hours, and we suspect several packs who've long been at odds with us, primarily because our pack is more prosperous than theirs,"" Nathaniel continued whilst enjoying his meal. ""I'll be home rather late today. Would you mind preparing my packed lunch as usual?""

""Yes,"" I replied with uncharacteristic indifference.

""Has Iona not awakened yet? Poor thing must be terrified and traumatised. I'll take her for a picnic next weekend,"" Nathaniel mused.

I sighed and stared at him in utter disbelief. Our daughter had been lying in the mortuary for two days, yet he remained completely oblivious to this devastating reality.

Drawing a deep breath, I murmured, ""Actually, Iona‚Äî""

Before I could explain that our daughter would never wake again, Nathaniel's mobile rang. Upon answering, his face contorted with worry, and he sprung to his feet with alarming urgency.

""Mate, could you possibly drop off that packed lunch at the office later? Something urgent's come up. Hazel's having seizures,"" Nathaniel announced.

""Nathaniel!"" I called out sharply.

""I'm terribly sorry, but this is paramount, Angie. Listen, you've recovered from your injuries, haven't you? So I really must look after Hazel and Yoan. Yoan's a widow now, and her husband was a high-ranking Theta who wielded considerable influence in the Pearl Harbor Pack.""

""Yes, I've recovered, and your daughter hasn't awakened,"" I replied with biting sarcasm, ""And perhaps never will.""

""Oh, come now, Angie. This is hardly the time for petty jealousy,"" Nathaniel grumbled.

""Yes, I know.""

""Thank you for understanding, Angie. I'll see you at the office later."" Nathaniel patted my head before grabbing his coat and departing.

In that moment, I felt like an insignificant fragment of Nathaniel's life‚Äîas I had always been. Nathaniel prioritised Yoan and Hazel above all else, whilst I remained an outsider desperately trying to breach their world.

I watched Nathaniel's car begin to pull away from the house, feeling increasingly alienated by the reality before me. Just before his final departure, a courier had arrived with a bouquet of lilies and a box of luxury chocolates. I knew, with crushing certainty, that these were gifts for Yoan and her son.

Nathaniel could be so lavish with others, yet last month's memory stabbed at my heart‚Äîwhen Iona had asked for a new doll, Nathaniel had merely tossed her a packet of cheap hair bands.

I'd always known Nathaniel desperately yearned for a son, but his treatment of Iona had been beyond cruel.

To him, Hazel might as well have been his own son‚Äîborn of a woman who‚Äôd stood by his side for years, after all. Meanwhile, my Iona is a child of his newfound choice, sprung from the womb of a wife he selected only recently. Nathaniel‚Äôs priorities will forever lie with Yoan and Hazel, never with me or my poor, overlooked girl.

Yoan‚Äôs husband, Carl, perished a year ago‚Äîhis life claimed by grievous wounds from a night hunt. Yet even in death, Carl‚Äôs devotion to Yoan remained unshakable, flawless. And now, Yoan has my husband‚ÄîNathaniel‚Äîas her closest confidant. A man who dotes on her, who would move heaven and earth for her. A loyalty I‚Äôve never been granted, though by every right, I should claim it.

Time and again, this bitterness towards Yoan and Hazel has gnawed at me. Even when I carried Iona‚Äîclinging to her as my body threatened to betray us both‚Äîit festered. Yet whenever I dared confront Nathaniel, he dismissed it as hysterics. Blind jealousy, he‚Äôd sneer, as though my anguish were some trifling melodrama.

But Nathaniel remains wilfully oblivious to the heart of it: his own daughter, who‚Äôs never known a father‚Äôs love. Half the pack whispers of it‚Äîthis unspoken truth about Iona‚Äîyet he parades his indifference like virtue. No wrongdoing here, his silence declares.

And oh, how it stings. When he lavishes Yoan with jewels fit for a queen, I receive trinkets I could pluck from the market myself. It‚Äôs not the cost, Nathaniel. It‚Äôs the care‚Äîthe absence of thought for the woman who‚Äôs sacrificed everything. For you.

Still, I dare not confront Yoan or her son. The Pearl Harbour Pack would sooner tear out my throat than see me as their Luna. Her they adore; me, they tolerate.

The microwave‚Äôs piercing beep jolts me from my misery. I busy myself packing two lunchboxes‚Äîoverstuffed, as always‚Äîthen gather laundry with mechanical haste. But my hands freeze mid-fold. His shirt. Nathaniel‚Äôs, worn last night. I press it to my face, and‚Äî

Scent of gladiol and musk. Her.

‚ÄúYoan‚Äôs,‚Äù Sky, my wolf, growls through the mindlink. No hesitation. No mercy.

The tears come then, ugly and suffocating.

He was with her. While I lay bleeding, mourning Iona‚Äôs eternal absence, he clung to her.

Every whispered promise, every ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre my only‚Äù



Chapter 3

The shirt slips from my grip as my knees buckle. All those lies, so deftly spun, and I‚Ä¶ I believed.

Every suspicion I‚Äôd stifled for years razored open, raw and brutal.

I lurched to my feet, ribs cracking under the truth‚Äîher perfume cloying his collars, the bouquet he‚Äôd never brought me, the glacial distance between us. It wasn‚Äôt suspicion anymore. It was arithmetic.

I‚Äôd always been the third.

The mobile trembled in my grip, fingers slick with fury. How many times had we rowed over Yoan? How many times had he spun my pain into pettiness, made me grovel for daring to question his ‚Äúloyalty‚Äù?

Not this time.

No more contorting myself into apologies. No more haunting my own bloody marriage.

I stabbed at the screen, dialling the number I‚Äôd ignored weeks prior‚Äîthe one cryptic offer I‚Äôd dismissed, clinging to the delusion that Nathaniel might change. That I might still matter.

‚ÄúAlpha Malcolm.‚Äù My voice was glacial, steady‚Äîa stark contrast to the fault lines fracturing my insides. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve reconsidered your‚Ä¶ proposal. I‚Äôll be transferring back to the Black Widow Pack.‚Äù

A beat of silence. Then, deliberate, as though etching the words into the air itself, ‚ÄúSoon.‚Äù

Months prior, Alpha Malcolm had presented me with a prestigious opportunity: to serve as an agricultural strategist at Black Widow Pack‚Äôs academy farm. The same academy where I had once been a prodigy‚Äîwhere I‚Äôd first crossed paths with Nathaniel, and where I‚Äôd mastered critical techniques in communal survival and sustainable leadership.

My affinity for agriculture had bloomed early. As a child, I‚Äôd nurtured an unrelenting fascination for livestock husbandry and crop cultivation‚Äîa passion that hardened into academic obsession. By sixteen, I‚Äôd drafted pioneering methodologies to optimise harvest yields; by twenty, my research licences with Black Widow Pack had earned me a formal endorsement from their Leader himself. When Nathaniel proposed five years ago, I was being groomed for a coveted role in their Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs.

Yet love loomed over me like a scythe. In the delicate calculus of devotion, I chose Nathaniel. I forfeited my ambitions, dismantled my laboratory, and vanished into the shadows of Pearl Harbor Pack as its Luna.

Two years later, Alpha Malcolm reached out once more, urging me to reclaim the role. Black Widow Pack‚Äôs harvests had failed catastrophically; they needed expertise I could provide. Yet loyalty to Nathaniel anchored me. I declined again‚Äîthough not without sending crates of our surplus grain to stave off their famine.

How could I, as Luna, abandon Pearl Harbor? My duty, I‚Äôd told myself, lay in the soil of these lands, in the pulse of this pack.

But yesterday‚Äôs ambush shattered that illusion. As Iona and I bled out on the forest floor, Nathaniel had raced to Yoan‚Äôs side first. Not mine. Not ours. My daughter‚Äôs death, my own brush with oblivion‚Äîthey were mere footnotes to him.

A Luna in title. A ghost in practice.

Why linger where my Alpha‚Äîmy husband‚Äîtreated my existence as incidental?

The decision crystallised, cold and unyielding. I dialled Alpha Malcolm‚Äôs number, voice steady. ‚ÄúI accept your offer. I‚Äôm returning to Black Widow Pack.‚Äù

‚ÄúExcellent news, Angie. Our pack‚Äôs doors remain open to you,‚Äù Alpha Malcolm replied, his voice brimming with a warmth that seemed to transcend the receiver. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll expedite the transfer documentation and forward the requisite files once prepared. Ensure your affairs here are settled‚Äîwe‚Äôll prioritise a seamless transition.‚Äù

‚ÄúThank you, Alpha Malcolm,‚Äù I said, steadying the tremor in my words. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm grateful for this chance. You‚Äôll have no cause to doubt my commitment.‚Äù

The call ended. I stood motionless, the weight of finality pressing down. There was no undoing it now, I would leave.

Yet duty lingered.

I assembled Nathaniel‚Äôs lunch‚Äîroasted pheasant, honeyed oats‚Äîand added extra portions for the labourers reconstructing the storm-ravaged eastern barracks. A habitual gesture, but today it felt ceremonial. A quiet farewell to the life I‚Äôd clung to for too long.

My thoughts drifted unbidden to my early days in Pearl Harbor Pack. I bore no hatred for this place. The pack members‚Äîgenerous, resilient souls‚Äîhad shown me nothing but kindness, despite my outsider origins.

But their warmth couldn‚Äôt mend the fractures within my own walls. If my marriage had become a hollow pantomime, if my husband‚Äôs loyalties frayed at the slightest test‚Ä¶ what solace was there in duty without devotion?

A home ought to be a sanctuary, yet for me, it had become nothing more than a vessel of solitude.

Lost in contemplation, I arrived at the Alpha's office and, as was customary, entered without requiring permission. The staff greeted me with their usual warmth as I made my way to the lounge to deposit the snacks I had prepared.

As I stood there, my mobile vibrated. An email from Alpha Malcolm appeared, containing the attached transfer documents. The reality of the situation struck me, and I resolved to print them in Nathaniel's office later.

Yet just as I prepared to leave, I caught wind of hushed gossip. I halted, my heart descending as I recognised the subject of their whispered exchange.

""You simply must have seen it,"" one pack member whispered with barely contained excitement. ""At the clinic, Alpha Nathaniel presented Yoan with flowers and the most expensive chocolates for Hazel. It was absolutely romantic.""

""Indeed? He's been terribly sweet to her. With everything Yoan's experiencing with her son after the attack, she must be utterly distraught.""

Another voice interjected, ""I wonder... if Beta Hazel is their biological child, surely our pack would grow stronger?""

""Perhaps. Some say they're already mates, you know.""

A gasp escaped my lips before I could suppress it. Surely they couldn't be serious? My chest constricted as I stood, rooted to the spot.

""What? How could they possibly be mates? Yoan already has one,"" someone questioned, their voice laden with disbelief.

""Well, I've heard Beta Yoan's husband isn't actually her fated mate. Besides, it's hardly unprecedented for Alphas and Lunas to marry without being true mates, is it?""

They spoke the truth there‚Äî



Chapter 4

Nathaniel and I weren't fated mates.

We'd met at the academy, where Nathaniel had pursued me rather determinedly. Initially, I had resisted, holding fast to my belief that I should wait for my fated mate.

But Nathaniel had been persistent, and eventually, he persuaded me. He made a solemn promise that if neither of us had found our mates by seventeen, we would marry.

And so we did. For five years, we'd shared our lives, believing we'd somehow circumvented the hand of fate.

But now, hearing their words, an overwhelming realisation descended upon me.

What if Nathaniel truly had found his mate? What if that mate was indeed Yoan?

Tears threatened to spill, but I forced them back. I simply couldn't allow them to witness my anguish.

With glacial composure, I interrupted their conversation. ""Is that true?""

The packmates recoiled, their whispers dissolving into panicked stammering. ‚ÄúLuna Angeline‚Äîwe didn‚Äôt realise you were there‚Äî‚Äù

Before I could demand answers, the lounge door crashed open. A breathless voice sliced through the silence, ‚ÄúBeta Hazel‚Äôs collapsed‚Äîcardiac failure. They‚Äôre stabilising him now.‚Äù

\*\*\*

The operating theatre was stifling, the air thick with antiseptic and dread. I leaned against the wall, numb, as Nathaniel cradled Yoan‚Äîher body racked with sobs, his hands tender on her shoulders. The scene mirrored my own torment two days prior, alone in a sterile room, absorbing the news of my daughter‚Äôs death while my husband buried himself in her bed.

Now, watching them, bitterness coiled in my throat. I forced a thin smile. No theatrics. No scenes.

As I approached, Yoan flinched. Her tear-streaked face contorted with something akin to shame, and she lurched away from Nathaniel‚Äôs hold.

‚ÄúL-Luna Angeline‚Äîforgive me,‚Äù she choked. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve‚Ä¶ been close since we were children. He was only comforting me‚Äî‚Äù

Nathaniel spoke before I could.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve nothing to apologise for, Yoan.‚Äù His hand remained on her shoulder, his tone soft‚Äîtoo soft, the kind reserved for lovers, not friends. Not in his wife‚Äôs presence.

I exhaled sharply, my resolve hardening like frost on glass.

This wasn‚Äôt the first time his devotion to her had gouged at me. But today, amidst the pack‚Äôs murmurs and the pall of loss, it carved deeper. I heard their words‚Äîhe‚Äôs grown cold toward her; their bond was never true‚Äîand still, the question gnawed, Why marry me, then? Why chain us both?

The doubt clung like a parasite. Had Nathaniel wed me as some petty retort when Yoan bonded with her husband weeks before our ceremony? I crushed the thought. Our history spanned years‚Äîlong before her entanglement. Surely his proposal hadn‚Äôt been a blade aimed at her.

Or had it?

I blinked, realising the paramedics had vanished. Only we three remained in that claustrophobic corridor, the fluorescents humming their judgment.

Yoan‚Äôs voice punctured the silence. ‚ÄúWe must uncover a treatment for Hazel. Properly this time.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll secure specialists,‚Äù Nathaniel said, decisive. ‚ÄúWhatever‚Äôs required.‚Äù

The collusion stung anew. I turned sharply, heels clicking toward the exit.

‚ÄúAngeline‚Äî‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt pause. The corridors blurred as I quickened my pace, then broke into a sprint. The woods swallowed me‚Äîancient oaks and bracken offering crude solace. Shifting mid-stride, my wolf‚Äôs paws struck the mud as rain needled the canopy.

Run. Just run.

My wolf roused, her presence a balm. Steady, she murmured. You are not prey.

Yet my human heart fractured. What am I, then?

‚ÄúSteady, Angie,‚Äù Sky murmured, her voice a low thrum in my skull. ‚ÄúQuell this rage. Nathaniel isn‚Äôt your destined bond. Remember. Your worth isn‚Äôt shackled to his gaze.‚Äù

Her counsel cooled the tempest in my chest.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right,‚Äù I panted, halting beneath a cathedral of ancient pines, my breath fogging the damp air. ‚ÄúIf Nathaniel‚Äôs free to claim his fated mate, then so are we. We deserve that.‚Äù

‚ÄúUndeniably.‚Äù

Resolve hardened like frost. I returned to the manor, scrubbed myself raw under the shower‚Äôs blistering jets, and stalked to the wardrobe. Suitcase in hand, I began folding blouses with military precision.

‚ÄúTomorrow, I depart for the Black Widow Pack,‚Äù I vowed aloud.

No more compromises. No more withering in the shadow of a man who‚Äôd mistaken my loyalty for frailty.

The door hinges whined. Nathaniel loomed in the threshold, his gaze narrowing on the half-filled suitcase.

‚ÄúExplain this.‚Äù His tone was glacial, detached‚Äîthe voice of an Alpha assessing a tactical blunder, not a husband confronting his wife‚Äôs abandonment.

‚ÄúTidying the wardrobe,‚Äù I lied, the suitcase‚Äôs weight a leaden anchor as I smoothed creases from a blouse I‚Äôd never wear again.

‚ÄúRight. I‚Äôll be accompanying Yoan to the Silver Fang Pack tomorrow,‚Äù Nathaniel announced, as though discussing a grocery list. ‚ÄúRegarding the attack.‚Äù His tone was rehearsed, lifeless. ‚ÄúWhilst you‚Äôre here‚Äîpack my charcoal suit. The Brioni one.‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course,‚Äô‚Äù I replied, toneless. My gaze remained fixed on the silk beneath my fingers‚Äîsafer than meeting the ice in his eyes.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll shower, then work late. Don‚Äôt bother with supper.‚Äù The bathroom door clicked shut.

I said nothing. Let the silence fester. Folded trousers, stacked jumpers, each movement precise. Let him work. Let him stay. Let him warm her bed until the sheets frayed. I‚Äôd long since drained my reserves of outrage.

Dawn bled through the curtains as the door groaned. Nathaniel stood silhouetted, shirt rumpled, eyes bloodshot.

‚ÄúWhy‚Äôs your case the only one packed?‚Äù His voice was sandpapered rough.

I blinked slowly. ‚ÄúMy oversight. I‚Äôll sort yours after breakfast.‚Äù

‚ÄúSee that you do.‚Äù He thrust a roll of notes at me. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a Full English in the kitchen. Prepare lunches‚Äîtwo portions. Yoan‚Äôs barely eaten since Hazel‚Äôs decline.‚Äù

I pocketed the cash. ‚ÄúNaturally.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd ensure my case is ready by noon,‚Äù he called over his shoulder. ‚Äú‚ÄòCritical meeting at the office.‚Äù

The door snapped shut behind him before I could muster a retort. I stared at the void where he‚Äôd stood‚Äîthe man who once lavished me with devotion now reduced to a spectre in his own home.

In our first year, my silences would unravel him. He‚Äôd arrive with armfuls of peonies from Covent Garden, book spontaneous weekends in the Cotswolds, his apologies whispered against my neck. Now, even my absence went unmarked.

He‚Äôs severed himself from us, Sky observed, her voice a blade sheathed in sorrow.

‚ÄúThen we owe no explanations,‚Äù I murmured, padding to the en suite. Let the scalding water purge his scent from my skin.



Chapter 5

Breakfast was ashes on my tongue. At the butcher‚Äôs, I selected cuts with methodical cruelty, ribeye for Nathaniel, venison for Yoan. A culinary send-off laced with silent venom.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll need a proper carnivorous spread,‚Äù Sky remarked, her tone laced with grim levity.

‚ÄúNaturally.‚Äù I pictured his face when he discovered the emptied wardrobes, the hollowed-out study.

On the walk back, I lingered at the training grounds. The newest recruits‚Äîpuppies, really‚Äîdrilled under the Gammas‚Äô barked orders. My chest tightened. Last time you‚Äôll play the dutiful Luna.

At the kiosk, I bought every Jammie Dodger and Penguin bar in stock. They swarmed me, all gap-toothed grins and grass-stained knees.

‚ÄúThanks a lot, Luna!‚Äù they chorused, one freckled boy clutching my sleeve. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre proper angelic, you are. Don‚Äôt let no one say otherwise!‚Äù

I knelt, smoothing his cowlick. ‚ÄúMind your Gamma. And never apologise for second helpings.‚Äù

Their praise lodged like shrapnel in my throat. ‚ÄúPersevere,‚Äù I urged, forcing a smile. Did they sense the valediction beneath my gestures? The finality?

Back in the kitchen, I assembled two tiffin carriers‚Äîone for him, one for her. Once, I‚Äôd packed twin meals for our shared lunches in his office: debating policy over Coronation chicken sandwiches, stealing crisps from his plate. Now, I was little more than a courier for his indifference.

When did the erosion begin? I wondered, arranging samosas with surgical precision. After her mate‚Äôs death? Or earlier‚Äîwhen his eyes first lingered too long on her mourning black?

The walk to his office felt surreal, as though observing a stranger enacting this pantomime of devotion. Last lunch. Last compromise. Last shred of hope discarded.

The room stood empty, stale coffee crusting a mug emblazoned with World‚Äôs Best Alpha. Predictable. His new Beta shrugged: ‚ÄúWith Beta Yoan. Her girl‚Äôs taken a turn.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll wait,‚Äù I said, tone flat.

Alone, I approached his desk. The drawer slid open with a conspiratorial whisper. Beneath requisition forms lay the pack seal‚Äîa tarnished silver wolf‚Äôs head.

Hands steady, I stamped the transfer documents Alpha Malcolm had provided. No signature required.

A shuddering breath escaped me. One copy abandoned on the desk; the other secreted in my handbag. My visa to sovereignty.

‚ÄúNow, the final‚Ä¶‚Äù My whisper died as Yoan‚Äôs voice slithered through the pack bond.

Angie, darling‚ÄîNathaniel mentioned you‚Äôre lurking in his office? Do be a love and bring lunch here. He‚Äôs ever so peckish.

Honeyed poison. My jaw clenched. The memory of last month‚Äôs ‚Äúfamily dinner‚Äù surfaced‚ÄîHazel‚Äôs pointed silence, Yoan‚Äôs saccharine pity, Iona‚Äôs trembling lower lip.

Still, this would be my final grovelling act.

‚ÄúCourse,‚Äù I bit out, boots scuffing laminate.

Yoan‚Äôs terraced house reeked of bergamot and deceit. Jeremy answered, shirt half-buttoned, trousers misaligned.

‚ÄúWho authorised this visit?‚Äù he snapped, jerking his belt buckle.

My gaze flickered past him to Yoan, swathed in a silk dressing gown. ‚ÄúInterrupting something?‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be absurd,‚Äù she purred, a Butter-wouldn‚Äôt-melt tone. ‚ÄúI insisted you come. Nathaniel, darling‚Äîstop glowering.‚Äù

Nathaniel‚Äîshoeless, collar askew‚Äîcollapsed onto her Chesterfield as if born to it.

‚ÄúDo come in, Angie,‚Äù Yoan simpered, plucking the tiffin carrier from my grip. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs make this civil.‚Äù

I trailed her through the cramped hallway, the air thick with jasmine and performative grief.

‚ÄúHow‚Äôve you been coping?‚Äù I asked, the question ash on my tongue.

She arranged her face into a mask of martyrdom. ‚ÄúOh, dreadful at first. But Carl‚Äôs sacrifice was the Moon Goddess‚Äôs design, wasn‚Äôt it? One mustn‚Äôt question divine will.‚Äù Her eyes remained arid.

Pity Carl died before learning his wife and child enjoy toying with another‚Äôs husband, I thought, spooning dal onto porcelain.

Yoan‚Äôs gaze snagged on the mating brand beneath my collar. ‚ÄúNathaniel mentioned that‚Ä¶ mark. Quaint, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù

‚ÄúA temporary brand,‚Äù I said, ladling rice with excessive care. ‚ÄúYours with Carl was genuine, of course. Mine‚Äôs merely ink.‚Äù

Her mouth tightened. As I turned to set the table, my phone trilled‚ÄîAllison.

Stepping onto the rain-slicked porch, I answered.

‚ÄúAngie‚ÄîMalcolm‚Äôs intel checks out?‚Äù My brother‚Äôs voice crackled with static and worry. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not fleeing because he‚Äôs hurt you?‚Äù

My breath hitched. ‚ÄúTransfer‚Äôs underway. How‚Äôs Mum?‚Äù

‚ÄúPining. We all are. When?‚Äù

‚ÄúTonight. Tomorrow. Soon.‚Äù

Through the window, I watched Yoan feed Nathaniel a samosa, her fingers lingering near his lips.

‚ÄúSoon,‚Äù I repeated, the word a vow.

The call disconnected. Nathaniel stood framed in the doorway, his collar still askew.

‚ÄúWho was that?‚Äù A question sharp as a papercut.

‚ÄúAllison,‚Äù I said, meeting his gaze unflinching. ‚ÄúEnquiring after my wellbeing.‚Äù

He nodded, a bureaucrat‚Äôs gesture. ‚ÄúJoin us, then.‚Äù No apology. No acknowledgement of the obscenity. Merely logistics.

The sheer banality of his presumption stole my breath. No flicker of remorse‚Äîonly the mild irritation of a man whose mistress‚Äôs lunch had gone cold.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll pass.‚Äù My smile could‚Äôve carved glass. ‚ÄúOther obligations.‚Äù

‚ÄúSuit yourself. Home later.‚Äù He turned, already halfway back to Yoan‚Äôs simpering laughter.

Not your home. Not anymore.

Drizzle stung my cheeks as I hailed a black cab. My destination is the Family Division of the High Court. Final affidavits. Dissolution of a marital contract signed in youthful delusion.

But first, a necessary detour is the hospital mortuary. A hollow-eyed clerk processed Iona‚Äôs burial permit when I presented the document embossed with Nathaniel‚Äôs seal. No condolences. No hesitation. The mortuary staff moved with unseemly haste, transferring my daughter‚Äôs precious burden to the Black Widow Pack‚Äôs morgue under cover of administrative efficiency.

As I approached the courthouse steps, uncertainty coiled cold in my chest. My hand lingered on the brass handle, the weight of finality pressing upon me. \*Was this truly the path?\*

Then it returned‚Äîthe sting of that wretched evening, the hissed taunts, the spectacle of Nathaniel and Yoan‚Äôs entwined laughter while I faded into obscurity. Their bonded status, confirmed and celebrated, had seared through the pack like a brushfire, scorching the last fragile embers of our marital pretence.

I drew a sharp breath, knuckles whitening on the doorframe.

‚ÄúLive joyfully with your mate, Nathaniel,‚Äù I hissed to the empty air.

‚ÄúAnd I shall carve my own happiness from the ashes.‚Äù

The divorce papers bore my signature in swift, ink-black strokes. At home, I arranged the documents with clinical care‚Äîtwin wedding bands gleaming dully beside them‚Äîand scrawled a note of glacial brevity, ‚ÄòKindly arrange to sign.‚Äô

When I was done, I picked up my suitcase and left. This time, leave forever.

By dusk, I was speeding north, the Pearl Harbour Pack dissolving in my rearview. Relief coursed through me, sharp and bracing, yet beneath it thrummed a wire of tension. The transfer papers in my glovebox were stamped, lawful, irrefutable‚Äîbut would border guards truly permit a Luna to slip quietly into exile?

I needn‚Äôt have doubted. News of Nathaniel‚Äôs bonded union had outpaced even my departure. The officers at the checkpoint merely inclined their heads‚Äîa gesture hovering between deference and pity‚Äîand ushered me through without a word.

Dawn found me crossing into Black Widow territory, the jagged silhouette of my old life crumbling behind me.

Fatigue had long since been incinerated by adrenaline. Twelve hours of nocturnal motorways had left me thrumming with restless purpose‚Äîto reclaim my birthright, to bury my daughter with the rites denied by Pearl Harbour‚Äôs soulless protocols.

The Black Widow‚Äôs border cut across the moor like a blade. A lean silhouette materialised from the mist, collar upturned against the dawn chill. Allison.

I braked, wheels crunching gravel. He pried open the driver‚Äôs door before I‚Äôd cut the engine.

‚ÄúWelcome home, you absolute menace,‚Äù he drawled, though his gaze darted past me to the empty backseat. ‚ÄúShift over. And where‚Äî‚Äù His voice fractured, just once. ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs the tiny terror who owes me five birthday piggybacks?‚Äù

""I‚ÄîIona..."" The words withered in my throat as my eyes fixed on the small coffin perched on the passenger seat.

Allison‚Äôs face contorted‚Äîfear, rage, desolation‚Äîas if words had abandoned her entirely.

""What‚Äôs happened, Angie?"" she whispered, brittle.

Before I could answer, Nathaniel‚Äôs voice ruptured through my mind‚Äîa mindlink frayed with terror, fury, raw and jagged as shattered glass.

1l7rrft,https://www.reddit.com/r/TicketToEverywhere/comments/1l7rrft/best_hotels_in_new_orleans/,Best Hotels in New Orleans,"The moment I stepped off the plane at Louis Armstrong International Airport, New Orleans wrapped around me like a warm, humid embrace. The air was thick with possibility‚Äîand the faint scent of caf√© au lait drifting from somewhere beyond the terminal. But it wasn't until I caught my first glimpse of those iconic wrought-iron balconies adorning my hotel that I truly understood: choosing the right place to stay in the Big Easy isn't just about finding a bed for the night. It's about selecting the perfect lens through which to experience this magical, musical, completely intoxicating city.

After eight visits to New Orleans and nights spent in everything from grand luxury suites overlooking the Mississippi to charming boutique hideaways tucked behind garden courtyards, I've learned that **the best hotels in New Orleans** don't just provide accommodation‚Äîthey become part of your story. Whether you're drawn to the jazz-soaked corridors of a historic French Quarter mansion or the modern elegance of a riverfront tower, your hotel choice will shape every moment of your NOLA adventure.

Let me walk you through the hotels that have captured my heart (and occasionally stolen my sleep with their irresistible charm).

# Why Location Matters: The Magic of the French Quarter

On my second trip to New Orleans, I made the mistake of booking a hotel outside the **French Quarter** to save money. Big mistake. While the property was lovely, I found myself constantly calculating Uber rides and missing the spontaneous magic that happens when you can simply step outside your hotel door and into the rhythm of the city.

The **French Quarter**‚Äîor Vieux Carr√© as locals lovingly call it‚Äîisn't just a neighborhood; it's the beating heart of New Orleans. When you stay here, morning coffee comes with the soundtrack of street musicians tuning their instruments in Jackson Square. Evening cocktails are accompanied by the distant brass of a second line parade winding through the narrow streets. And late-night adventures? Well, they're just a stumble away from your hotel lobby.

But here's the insider secret I've learned: even within the French Quarter, location nuances matter. Hotels on quieter streets like Dauphine or Chartres offer peaceful courtyards where you can escape the Bourbon Street chaos, while properties directly on Royal Street put you steps from the city's finest antique shops and art galleries. The key is finding that sweet spot where you can dive into the action when you want it, and retreat to tranquil Southern elegance when you need to recharge.

# Luxury Hotels: Where Elegance Meets Southern Charm

# Four Seasons Hotel New Orleans

Rising 34 stories above Canal Street, the **Four Seasons** redefined luxury hospitality in New Orleans when it opened. I'll never forget my first stay here‚Äîstepping into my river-view room and watching the mighty Mississippi roll by while sipping a Sazerac from my private balcony. The hotel's modern elegance beautifully complements the historic city below, and their **Chandelier Bar** serves cocktails so expertly crafted they're practically works of art.

What sets this property apart is how it marries contemporary sophistication with authentic New Orleans touches. The rooftop pool offers a stunning escape from the summer heat, while the two signature restaurants showcase the city's incredible culinary heritage with a refined twist.

# The Windsor Court

Walking into **The Windsor Court** feels like stepping into a British manor house that somehow found its way to the American South. This AAA Five Diamond property has been setting the gold standard for luxury in New Orleans since 1984, and every detail reflects that commitment to excellence.

During my anniversary stay, the staff surprised us with champagne and hand-written notes welcoming us back. It's these personal touches‚Äîcombined with museum-quality art adorning the hallways and one of the city's most celebrated afternoon tea services‚Äîthat make The Windsor Court feel less like a hotel and more like a gracious private residence.

# The Roosevelt New Orleans, A Waldorf Astoria Hotel

The **Roosevelt Hotel** has been hosting dignitaries, celebrities, and discerning travelers since the 1890s, and stepping into its opulent lobby still takes my breath away. Those gleaming brass elevators, the mosaic floors that tell stories of old New Orleans, and the crystal chandeliers that have witnessed decades of celebration‚Äîthis is where history lives and breathes.

The recently renovated rooms blend period elegance with modern comforts, but it's the hotel's legendary **Sazerac Bar** that truly steals the show. Sitting at that mahogany bar, watching expert bartenders craft cocktails with the precision of seasoned musicians, you can almost hear the whispers of all the fascinating conversations that have unfolded in this very spot.

# Hotel Monteleone

There's something deeply special about **Hotel Monteleone**‚Äîperhaps because it's been family-owned since 1886, or maybe it's the way the staff treats every guest like a welcomed relative. The **Carousel Bar**, the hotel's famous rotating cocktail lounge, has become my traditional first stop on every New Orleans visit. Sipping a Pimm's Cup while slowly spinning above the French Quarter streets never gets old.

The hotel's rooftop pool offers spectacular views of the Quarter's red-tiled roofs and church spires, while the literary heritage (Tennessee Williams once called it home) adds an extra layer of cultural richness to every stay.

# Boutique Gems: Character and Soul

# Maison de la Luz

Crowned as Travel + Leisure readers' **#1 hotel in New Orleans** in 2024, **Maison de la Luz** occupies a beautifully converted 1908 City Hall annex. This 67-room gem proves that sometimes the most memorable hotels are those that embrace their unique architectural bones rather than fighting them.

What captured my heart here wasn't just the stunning Art Deco details or the thoughtfully curated local art‚Äîit was the evening wine and cheese reception that transforms the lobby into an intimate gathering space. Guests naturally migrate toward each other, sharing travel stories and restaurant recommendations over carefully selected Louisiana wines. It's the kind of organic hospitality that can't be manufactured.

# Hotel Peter & Paul

Converting a 19th-century Catholic church, schoolhouse, and rectory into a boutique hotel could have gone very wrong. Instead, **Hotel Peter & Paul** in the Marigny neighborhood became something extraordinary. Each of the 71 rooms tells a different story, with four-poster beds topped with small crosses nodding to the property's religious heritage while rich fabrics and country-style furnishings create an unexpectedly harmonious blend.

The church bar, set within the original sanctuary, serves as both a stunning architectural showpiece and a gathering place that honors the building's spiritual past. It's the kind of place that makes you slow down, appreciate craftsmanship, and feel connected to the layers of history beneath your feet.

# The Chloe

This transformed Victorian mansion in the Garden District embodies everything I love about New Orleans' ability to preserve the past while embracing the present. **The Chloe** feels like staying in a wealthy relative's perfectly appointed home‚Äîif that relative happened to have impeccable taste and a gift for entertaining.

The wraparound porches provide the perfect perch for afternoon cocktails, while the hotel's restaurant consistently ranks among the city's finest. During my last visit, I spent an entire morning on the veranda with coffee and beignets, watching the streetcar glide past century-old oak trees. Pure New Orleans magic.

# Hotel Mazarin

Tucked between Bourbon and Royal streets, **Hotel Mazarin** offers boutique charm without sacrificing location. The crystal chandeliers and marble details in each room create an intimate luxury that feels authentically New Orleans, while **Patrick's Bar Vin** downstairs has become my go-to spot for a pre-dinner glass of wine and expert local recommendations.

What I love most about this property is how it strikes the perfect balance‚Äîclose enough to hear the jazz spilling out of Bourbon Street clubs, but quiet enough that you can actually sleep when you're ready to call it a night.

# Historic Properties: Stories in Every Room

# Royal Sonesta New Orleans

There's nothing quite like experiencing Mardi Gras from a **Royal Sonesta** balcony overlooking Bourbon Street. This luxury hotel has been hosting revelers and refined travelers since 1969, and every room tells stories of the countless celebrations, intimate conversations, and magical moments that have unfolded within these walls.

The heated courtyard pool provides a welcome respite from the French Quarter's energetic pace, while the hotel's **Jazz Playhouse** (voted #1 Jazz Club in New Orleans) ensures that live music remains central to the experience. During my last stay, I found myself lingering in the lobby each evening, drawn by the impromptu performances that seemed to emerge naturally from the hotel's musical soul.

# Soniat House

Spread across two colonial townhouses dating back to the 1830s, **Soniat House** offers an intimate glimpse into New Orleans' elegant past. The antique-filled rooms, each uniquely decorated with period furnishings, make you feel like a privileged guest in a private French Quarter residence.

The hidden courtyard, draped with jasmine and shaded by ancient magnolia trees, provides the perfect setting for morning coffee or evening cocktails. It's the kind of place where you instinctively speak in hushed tones, not because you have to, but because the atmosphere itself commands respect for the history you're inhabiting.

# Dauphine Orleans Hotel

The **Dauphine Orleans** embraces its colorful past with a wink and a smile. Built on the site of a former bordello, the hotel playfully acknowledges its risqu√© heritage while providing comfortable, uniquely decorated accommodations just steps from Bourbon Street.

**May Baily's Place**, the hotel's bar named after the infamous madam who once operated here, serves as both a conversation starter and a charming gathering spot. The saltwater pool, hidden away in the central courtyard, offers a peaceful escape where you can almost imagine the fascinating characters who once walked these same grounds.

# Budget-Friendly Options with Local Flavor

Finding affordable accommodations in New Orleans doesn't mean sacrificing character or location. Some of my most memorable stays have been at these charming properties that prove luxury isn't always about thread counts and marble bathrooms‚Äîsometimes it's about authentic hospitality and local soul.

**Hotel St. Marie**, part of the respected Valentino Hotels collection, offers genuine French Quarter charm at prices that won't break the bank. The exposed brick walls, wrought-iron details, and peaceful courtyard create an atmosphere that feels quintessentially New Orleans. Plus, guests can access pools at other Valentino properties throughout the Quarter‚Äîa perk that adds significant value to your stay.

**French Market Inn** puts you within walking distance of the famous **Caf√© du Monde** and the bustling French Market, while maintaining the intimate scale of a boutique property. The 19th-century building's architectural details have been lovingly preserved, and the staff consistently goes above and beyond to ensure guests feel welcomed and informed about local attractions.

**Place d'Armes Hotel** proves that budget-friendly doesn't mean basic. The historic property surrounds a lush courtyard where you can escape the Quarter's energy while remaining steps from all the action. Many rooms feature exposed brick walls and traditional New Orleans architectural details that provide authentic character without the luxury price tag.

# Insider Tips for Booking Like a Local

After years of visiting New Orleans, I've learned that timing can dramatically impact both availability and pricing. **Hotel rates fluctuate wildly** based on the city's packed event calendar‚ÄîMardi Gras, Jazz Fest, and major football games can triple normal rates overnight. My advice? Book early for major events, but consider visiting during shoulder seasons like late fall or early spring when you'll find better deals and smaller crowds.

Here's a local secret: many French Quarter hotels offer **package deals** that include perks like breakfast, parking, or cocktail credits. These packages often provide better value than booking rooms alone, especially at properties like Hotel Monteleone or The Roosevelt, where parking can cost $40+ per night.

For the best rates at boutique properties, book directly through the hotel's website rather than third-party booking sites. Many hotels offer **rate matching** guarantees and throw in additional perks like room upgrades or late checkout for direct bookings. Plus, when you book directly, you're more likely to receive personalized service and insider recommendations from staff who appreciate your business.

**Tuesday through Thursday stays** typically offer the best rates, while weekends command premium pricing, especially during festival seasons. If your schedule allows flexibility, arriving on a weekday can save you significant money that's better spent on the city's incredible restaurants and live music venues.

# Your New Orleans Story Awaits

Choosing where to stay in New Orleans isn't just about amenities or location‚Äîit's about selecting the backdrop for your own Big Easy adventure. Whether you're drawn to the grandeur of a historic luxury hotel, the intimate charm of a boutique property, or the authentic character of a budget-friendly inn, the right choice will enhance every moment of your visit.

The beauty of New Orleans lies in its ability to surprise and delight at every turn. Your hotel becomes your sanctuary between jazz-filled nights and beignet-sweetened mornings, your launching point for culinary adventures and cultural discoveries. Choose wisely, embrace the city's legendary hospitality, and prepare to fall in love with a place that will call you back again and again.

Ready to experience the magic for yourself? Book that French Quarter hotel, pack your appetite for adventure, and prepare to create your own New Orleans story. Trust me‚Äîthe city is waiting to welcome you home.",1,1749537037.0,TicketToEverywhere,0,1.0,False

I figured I‚Äòd go to sleep earlier than usual. didn‚Äòt happen. when the alarm went off today I barely managed to drag my ass out of the bed.

the commute went smoothly. mostly, that is. it‚Äòs a 10 minute walk from the train station to work and outside the train station, there‚Äòs a construction site. roughly a year ago, they tore away all the asphalt and concrete, did nothing for months and then some random digging and pipe-laying, and now it‚Äòs finally taking shape. BUT they change the path to this part of the city like every other week. it‚Äòs a fenced off path leading past, or occasonally through the construction site. sometimes they‚Äòre doing work IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PATH. the machinery is too loud for a good day when it comes to my sensory issues, and WAY too loud for 7:20am when I haven‚Äòt had my second cup of coffee yet. at least I have my headphones, they help
with that but the ever changing path pisses me off every time.

then there‚Äòs been a change in the cleaning schedule of my workplace. the cleaners used to start at 6am so they‚Äòre done when my team starts arriving. but for some reason it was changed to 7am. my boss thinks it‚Äòs due to building management thinking that if they‚Äòre cleaning later, someone is arround to supervise them a bit and make them aware in case they miss a room or something. afaia, nobody is doing that. the only change I see is that my fellow early-rising coworkers and I are pissed off every other morning because we have to wait for them to finish cleaning the office and then a little longer for the floor to dry.

and finally, one of my coworkers wrote one of the most infuriating equipment lists I‚Äòve seen in a long time. my workplace is basically the main quarters of our department, but when needed we pack our shit and do our thing at most of my company‚Äòs sites all over the city plus some more. tomorrow is one such day and the job requires a whole lot of equipment.

if I hadn‚Äòt read the list like 5 times and thought to myself ‚Äûyeah great but we need other essentials as well‚Äú I would never have guessed that the top half - which looks like a drafted plan to help figure out the equipment - is part of the list! and ofc he didn‚Äòt write down the sets we have, but only the vaguest possible terms for what he plans on using. dude is lucky I don‚Äòt trust anyone‚Äòs packing lists except my own.

I‚Äòm betting that if I only packed the stuff that‚Äòs on the part of the list that actually looks like a list, he‚Äòd berate me for not reading his thoughts or something, but wouldn‚Äòt see any fault with himself for writing such a shitty list.

at least I‚Äòm having a quiet day today. I‚Äòll probably be alone all day so I‚Äòll get to work in 100% my own pace. maybe I‚Äòll treat myself to some seriously autistic cable coiling haha.

edit: no alone time for me. boss texted me that he‚Äòll be here in a bit.

also, I just figured out that in order to take time off for the next concert I‚Äòll attend, I‚Äòm going to have to do a little over an hour of overtime every day (the concert is in another city and I need two days off to get there and back) because I insist on taking all of my remaining paid leave at once this summer.",2,1749536955.0,AutisticAdults,1,1.0,False

Goblin Style? You bet.** It‚Äôs me, after spending over 30 hours in *Dune Awakening* (EU server: Daedros - come join!).

Today‚Äôs the official launch, so, in short? I totally recommend it! For a game that‚Äôll give you hundreds of hours of solid fun, for around $50 - is basically a steal.

Here‚Äôs a little story from yesterday that I‚Äôll remember for a long time! Grab a cup of tea, coffee, or water, and enjoy the read - no major spoilers, promise.

So in the Haga Basin (a huge PvE starting zone), there‚Äôs this canyon that goes *way* down underground‚Äîmaybe even for miles. It‚Äôs full of different levels and massive areas where rare materials are being mined. I‚Äôd been on the hunt for one of these resources last two days, trying to unlock the next tier of crafting gear. I‚Äôd heard whispers it was down there.

So off I went. I jumped down with the help of my trusty anti-gravity belt, which made the descent safe and easy. First level, second level, third level‚Ä¶ it got darker and darker, until the light couldn‚Äôt reach at all. The scale? Just massive. I don‚Äôt know how they do it, but just like in *Conan Exiles*, here too I felt like a speck of dust in this huge world.

I didn‚Äôt see the resource right away, so I summoned my vehicle and started cruising around. After a while, I found a mining outpost leading even deeper underground. Inside? Enemies everywhere, but also the precious resource I needed. I mined as much as I could and filled my vehicle to the brim.

Then I hit a snag - how the heck was I going to get back out?

If I were on foot, I‚Äôd just use climbing ropes and haul myself up slowly, but with a fully loaded vehicle? No easy feat.

I got in and drove on. I noticed that the lights seemed to be laid out along one of the tunnels, so I decided to follow them and see if they‚Äôd lead me somewhere. I kept driving‚Ä¶ and eventually the path started to slope upwards. Looked like I was on the right track.

Along the way, I found some ‚Äúbarracks‚Äù - the name caught my eye, so I decided to explore. I expected a few rooms‚Ä¶ but it turned out to be an entire underground complex with multiple levels going even deeper down! Seriously, I got lost in there more than once. I decided not to push my luck and went back to my vehicle - if I died, I‚Äôd lose my gear and getting back here would take ages.

I kept following the lights, slowly making my way up‚Ä¶ until finally, I saw sunlight streaming in. After a bit longer, I emerged back to the surface.

And the best part? On my way home, out in the middle of nowhere, I randomly ran into a guy - my in-game neighbor I‚Äôd chatted with a few times over the past few days. We were both shocked - what are the chances of meeting in the middle of nowhere like that? We had a quick chat and went our separate ways. We would‚Äôve talked longer, but his girlfriend told him to shut up - it was almost midnight! ;)

I honestly can‚Äôt remember the last time a game gave me such an intense sense of adventure and excitement. I was glued to the screen, staying up way too late because there‚Äôs always just one more thing to do.

Bottom line? I highly recommend it.

I, 16F, had always been a bit creeped out by my father, 51M. He works in the military and is always overstimulated by work, so my relationship with him has always been tense due to him always being semi-controlling. He wouldn't hit me alot when I was a kid, but when he did, it would hurt and leave bruises, or he would kick me out for hours. Those times had stayed in my memory for as long as I grew up. I'm not sure whether it was trauma or just me being ""spoiled,"" as other family members would say, I just know it made me feel unsafe.

 I remember one time I didnt want to get something from the store, and so he completely kicked me out of the house barefoot, I was 9. There's alot of situations like this, so as a summary the fights mostly had the same dialogue: me not wanting to do specific chore or go to an outing and then my dad hitting me so hard it would bruise for weeks, take my phone, or/and kick me out. he didn't even bother to hide it so I'd have to lie on how I got bruises or why I was out of the house all alone.
My mom was always on his side, saying ""I set him up"" and that I should never say no, but I was no more than 10 in all of those and I didnt know better, it always caught me off guard since she is a therapist.

My mom also was so close to divorcing him from how much he demanded from her, for example if she swept behind of the refrigerator, he would scream at her because she didnt also do behind of their bed, and if she did, then she did it wrong and should do it again.

Also unrelated but something that stuck with me is that he'd never let me have space in my own room, or any room for that matter (including the kitchen, bathroom, under beds, drawers, all that you can name, literally), his ""memories"" (it's mostly garbage like a notebook from the 2008 or shoes that doesnt fit anyone) would always be in 89% of the room and so me and my brothers had to cramp our clothes in the rest. He never uses or looks at those stuff but would shout at me if I move them, and ""me disobeying him"" would be the main topic for the next two weeks.

My dad then later-on (this year, actually) half-heartedly apologised, claiming he had finally changed, and that apology only happened after I pressured him it wasnt normal for someone to hit a child under any circumstances.

Now to yesterday, I was playing a snake game and was in the highest score I ever had in this game when my dad woke up, now a side note, but my dad needs to have the sink fully cleaned before he wakes up and gets his coffee or else I'm in trouble. But that morning, a single plate wasnt cleaned, so he was mad at me and demanded I do it right at that time. I told him to give me a second, promising to do it later, but he kept insisting, I then jokingly asked if the plate was more important than me, to which he seriously said yes to. I then closed my game (highscore ruined:(), and asked him why he couldn't just tell anyone else to do the dish when I just told him I was busy, or just wait a moment for me to do it myself. He said I needed to do it now, and that he didnt need to discuss why.

He then, as usual, told me to give him my phone, I said if he took my phone then I won't do the plate at all, he said ""are you challenging me?"" and to which I said maybe (I admit at that moment I was wrong. I just wanted to test if he was true to his word and wouldn't hit me again, but that might have been a stupid excuse). He took my phone and slapped me, it hurt so bad my nails (real ones I took long to grow) flew, along with my glasses, and it hurt alot at the time.
My mom had asked me what happened, to which I told her the full story. She said I was malicious and I set him up.
I asked my brother, he said people has it worse like getting spanked etc etc, and I should be grateful he didn't do worse, and that if I didn't admit fault right now, later in life I would have someone treat me way worse as karma, and that if he was in his position he would do the same because ""no man likes to feel his ego threatened"".
I know it was immature of me to talk back, I just wanted to know if I should trust my father. He is just always too demanding, when I do something, he says I haven't done enough and tells me to do another, then another, then another. The only way I can escape it is by pretending to sleep whenever he's home, but I'm so tired of this. So AITAH?",0,1749536606.0,AITAH,5,0.5,False

Yet again another post looking for accommodation recommendations. Ive done a lot of reading, checking out posts etc but i wanted to ask around about different types of accommodations. I will be renting a car.

Ill be solo, mid 30s, planning on visiting in December (flexible travel dates). Originally i thought id be there for christmas but as i quickly found out, its double the price, so thinking perhaps mid december, more bang for my buck. I want to relax, hit the beach, maybe a pool, snorkel, surf, some light hikes, not interested in luxury shopping, want to eat some local food and drinks. I live in California so i can do a lot of these things at home. So, i think im leaning towards enjoying a warm beach, snorkeling, relaxing activities. I have never done a big resort style beach vacation as an adult. Typically when i solo travel i prefer to seek out more local scenes and activities with some tourist activities sprinkled in, but i tend to solo travel in bigger cities.

So here's my question - given what im looking for, would choosing one of these big resorts be ""better"" compared to a condo or something like Wailea Ekahi or Hale Pau Hana?

I gravitated towards Kihei (but am not 100% sold) because i like the idea of more of a community, variety of restaurants/food trucks, coffee, breweries etc. I can walk to some of these places then go back to the hotel/condo. But there is a part of me that thinks i cook and clean at home all the time, do i want to rent a place where it seems better suited to be cooking, making drinks at the condo, etc.? Like once im in for the night at the condo i cant do as much roaming around to hotel bars/restaurants/pool etc. One of things im not keen on for some of these resorts is lots of kids/families, although there are adult only pools at some of these places im sure. The other thing is, i feel like the resorts may feel less isolated with the big pools, tennis courts/pickleball, organized outings.

Im certainly overthinking but having never done a vacation where ive considered a large resort, the lure of a tiki bar alongside a pool, or poolside service sounds pretty sweet. Any thoughts or recommendations would be greatly appreciated. thank you!",1,1749536545.0,MauiVisitors,0,1.0,False

We meet like around twice a week and we had small conversations usually. Sometimes it was just casual greeting but sometimes I feel they‚Äôre a little more than that. He always gives me free coffee and bowls now that I consider we‚Äôre ‚Äúfriends‚Äù. 

I don‚Äôt know how to approach him or ask him out. I‚Äôm afraid that if he doesn‚Äôt like me then things will get weird. I don‚Äôt know his number or any socials. My friends encourage me to do that but I‚Äôm just scared. I don‚Äôt feel shy or nervous around other guys but I‚Äôm thinking too much when it comes to him. He‚Äôs also a very attractive guy that I feel like a lot of people like him and he‚Äôs doing the same to everyone but my coworkers say he‚Äôs not ‚Äúfriendly‚Äù to them. 

What should I do to make us closer and go on to next step? This has been going on for months. ",1,1749536422.0,dating_advice,4,1.0,False

It was definitely not that bad before I started Concerta. Can someone who have also stopped after being on it for a long time tell me when does natural dopamine stabilize? I can‚Äôt do this for long, I just want to sleep all the time and I don‚Äôt have that luxury due to having a toddler who needs constant attention. ",3,1749536399.0,Concerta,1,1.0,False
