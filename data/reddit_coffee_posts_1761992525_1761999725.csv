My usual is:
* 3 eggs cooked in Kerrygold with a sprinkle of shaved Parmesan. 
* What I call “keto tea” - a strong brew of English and chai teas with a scoop of C8 MCT powder. Coffee is tough on my stomach :(

There was this one girl sitting across the room — earbuds in, tapping her cup while waiting for her order. You know that type of person who doesn’t try to get attention but somehow has it anyway? Yeah, that.
Anyway, I smiled when she caught me looking (rookie mistake 😅), and she gave this small, shy grin back. It wasn’t dramatic or movie-like, but it stuck in my head all day.
Now I can’t decide if I should’ve gone up and said “Hey, you look like the type of person who finishes their coffee even when it’s gone cold” or if that would’ve just been weird 😂
Either way it made me realize sometimes the best moments are the ones that never actually happen

Still… if she somehow reads this I hope her coffee was good ☕💛",1,1761999593.0,indiasocial,0,1.0,False
1olme8l,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/1olme8l/im_so_tired_of_the_battle_between_my_medical/,I'm so tired of the battle between my medical conditions.,"(TW, lots talk of food, disordered habits, some mention of calories) 

I'm fucking exhausted. I wish I didn't need food to live. 

I was anorexic in my early teens, then became bulimic after ""recovery"" and now I'm at the weird gray area that is osfed. I switch between habits and disordered thought patterns constantly because of my health problems. 

I have contamination OCD and autism, which leads to a lot of problems/pickiness with food: texture issues, can't stand most meat except seafood, having specific safe foods (stuff that is always consistent in texture/taste), and getting stuck in cycles of only wanting to eat one specific food/meal, despite knowing its not always healthy or reasonable. This isn't completely horrible but like, I don't need to eat ramen for weeks on end until I get tired of it and never eat it again, you know? 

I have a list of safe foods that agrees with my autism and OCD, and a list of safe foods that DON'T trigger my ed. Some foods trigger anorexic habits, some trigger bulimic habits. 

I've been able to mostly balance and control my disordered habits since my last stint in recovery 7 yrs ago. Occasionally I'll have a couple weeks of going through a cycle of restriction and/or b/p but eventually I'll get back to normal. My weight does fluctuate but I've given up on getting better than I am. 

The current issue? 

My new health conditions are making it so much harder to balance now.

In the last few yrs, I was told I'm lactose intolerant, have Interstitial Cystitis and GERD, which means I can't eat anything caffinated, acidic, fatty or very processed. This eliminates a lot of my safe foods (diet soda, coffee, most fruits, juices, soy products, protein drinks/bars, most dairy products, most SEASONINGS, etc). 

I also became allergic to shellfish in the last year, which eliminates another set of safe foods. 

I also have POTS so staying physically active and hydrated is a challenge. I'm supposed to consume a lot of salt, a lot of water and eat small, frequent meals. This is a struggle because I do shift work in the medical field. 

At this point, my diet mostly consists of eggs, oats, non-acidic fruits, lactose + fat free dairy products, minimally processed carb sources, and potatoes.

And while the food itself is bland and boring, it's fine because I'm the kind of person who can meal prep and eat the same meals over and over again without struggle. 

The struggle is really just the mental and social affect. 

It's all very ""clean"" foods that I ate a lot when I was deep in my anorexia so when I eat those things, it takes me back to that time. It's also insanely triggering because mentally I immediately know the calories of everything I eat.

And it does get exhausting that I can't easily grab a snack whenever I want, or I can't eat the party foods in the breakroom. I struggle to eat meals with my bf too, either I eat my own food or I suffer in pain. 

I'm always thinking and worrying about food and it feels like a slippery slope into relapsing hard into a restrictive eating disorder. 

Recently at work, my lunch that I had meal prepped unexpectedly went bad and I couldn't leave to get new food, and nothing in the vending machine was safe for me to eat. So I just didn’t eat. And then around a day later, I realized that I hadn't eaten anything since then because I had completely lost the desire to. 

It's getting exhausting having to balance everything and I don't have anyone in my daily life that could relate or that I could even talk to.

1olmdk9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Medtronic780g/comments/1olmdk9/please_tell_me_this_is_part_of_the_process/,Please tell me this is part of the process,"Good morning. I would reach out to my rep and endo but it is early morning on the weekend and I probably need to calm down before I say something I regret.  I just got my training on the 780g with simplera sensor on Thursday morning and was told 'let it learn you' and not to mess with it too much.  Thursday evening, I was waking up through the night and would check the pump and if it was reading 150 or so, I would give myself a bolus correction.  I did this at least 3 times in the night. The last thing I wanted to do was wake up high as I had finally 'trained' my Omnipod 5 to keep me in range through the night.  

Yesterday morning, I made the mistake of bolousing too early before my meal.  I've been coming off a 5 day hospital stay b/c I was unable to eat without pain and got dehydrated. No official testing but guessing I may have developed gastroparesis.  So I had not been eating much, but on Thursday I felt I had turned the corner and could eat more. Well that was a mistake b/c Friday morning I boloused for what I thought would be 30 carbs. I tried to eat and got super nauseous and then BS crashed to 40.  It definitely freaked me out b/c I typically can treat a low, but was so sick I could barely sip juice without fear of vomiting.  So, yes, lesson learned.  

However, once my trainer and my endo saw what happened, my carb ratio was increased, along with insulin on board time (2 hrs to 3 hrs), and correction factor (40 to 50).  She said, 'I know you're not happy about this, but we need to keep you safe.' Of course, recovering from starvation (not official DKA-I had very high ketones but my BS was perfect) and a weight loss of 13lbs in 3 weeks, has messed with my timing/ratios, but I was still able to keep tight control in the hospital. They were great with that btw- I just had to sign something and they let me do my thing. Their 'sliding scale' insulin dosing is insane!

So I made a promise to them not to touch anything on the pump anymore- no corrections, and do 1/2 dose of carbs when starting a meal, and then dose the rest if I am able to finish it and see my numbers rising.

Last night, I had about a 1/2 cup of sorbet at 10:30 and dosed for 10 carbs. I went to bed at around midnight and my BS was 135. I number I don't like, but didn't want to get in trouble for trying to give a correction dose and assumed this pump would keep me in range (they moved my target range from 100 to 120).  Well I woke up this morning feeling like crap and here my BS was hovering around 200 all night. I got out of bed at 6:00 just so that I could get some coffee and give myself some insulin so it would include the additional insulin correction.  

There is no way I can go another night at 200 waiting for my pump to ""figure me out."" My trainer keeps insisting that the more I mess with it the longer it will take to do what it designed to do- keep me in a steady range with a target of 100.  This is why I left Omnipod.  I was willing to deal with this ridiculous bulky medical equipment with a tube so I would need less micromanaging for a lower target BS and that it would help if I under or overestimated my carb count when eating.  Will this ever happen?!

I do like my trainer- she has been doing this for many many years and is passionate about what she does. But she is NOT a type 1 diabetic and I don't know how any type 1 would find it acceptable to ride out at 200 for 8 hrs..... 

Oh boy- whelp, I gave myself 5 units for my coffee and it added the correction this morning and now I am double down 147 arrows.  So now what- eat carbs, but then the pump will think a dose for 5 carbs is equal to 25 carbs?! Ugh- I don't remember feeling this frustrated with Omnipod- but maybe I forget......

Thank you if you've read this far. I'm hoping someone can encourage me to be patient or give me some advice while I'm waiting to contact my trainer at a decent hour on a Saturday morning.

1olmanf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1olmanf/i_think_i_just_lost_all_hope_for_my_marriage/,I think I just lost all hope for my marriage,"My husband (34m) and I (41f) have been together for 7 years, married for 5. The problems started a few years ago, but until yesterday I still had hope things might change. Now I don't think so anymore.

The main issue is always the same: I want to spend more time together. In reality, we spend maybe 30 minutes a day — drinking coffee, having dinner. Of course, we do have nice evenings together every now and then, but they’re very rare, and most of the time our “time together” just means watching movies — which, for me, doesn’t really feel like quality time in the long run. I miss deep, engaging conversations. The feeling that you just love to be with the other. Cuddling, Sex, listening to music together, all this stuff...

 Occasionally we’ll spend a whole Saturday together if there are errands to run and we have a date (it's not that this doesn't happen at all but for me it's too rare. Maybe once every two month). I don’t expect us to be together every day, my ideal would be to have at least one evening a week and maybe Saturdays together. We tried things like a “Saturday date day,” but it only lasts two weeks before everything goes back to normal. I once suggested spending an hour together every evening after dinner — he said he didn’t have time for that.

When he was freelancing and had little work, he played video games all day (often from 2 PM to 3 AM). Now he’s got a full-time job and works constantly — sometimes until midnight. Partly because he has to, mostly because he wants to. It feels like he just doesn’t want to spend time with me. When I bring it up, he says things like “I just have a lot going on these next two weeks,” but those “two weeks” never end.

A few nights ago, I asked him to finally be honest about how much time he actually wants to spend with me. He said he couldn’t answer that because it depends on the day. I told him I want to FEEL that he wants to be with me — he got irritated, walked away, and that was it. Later he suggested we walk the dog together the next morning. I took that as a small olive branch. But then he didn’t get up the next morning (also a thing that happend more than once) After I came back from walking the dog there was no apology, no mention of it.  I didn't bring it up either because I didn't want to fight anymore. I am tired of it.

Whenever I talk about things that hurt me, he gets defensive — no matter how gently I bring it up. He never validates my feelings. His version of empathy is, “I’m sorry you feel that way,” or “You’re misinterpreting it.” He genuinely doesn’t understand emotional validation (we talked about this a lot) and believes it means “agreeing with me even if I’m wrong.”

When he’s defensive, he raises his voice, speaks fast, and gets visibly upset — which is very triggering for me. He says being loud and reactive is his “authentic expression” and that he doesn’t want to change that. Sometimes he tries, but it never lasts.

At this point I feel like I only have two options: either leave, or accept that he’ll never change and stop bringing up anything that bothers me. Sometimes I think I’m overreacting — especially when I see how kind and empathetic he is with other people. Then I forget how different he is with me (now, in the beginning it wasn't like this)

There are smaller things too. I’ve told him for years I’d love it if he brought me flowers sometimes. He never does — says he “doesn’t have time” because he’d have to go during his lunch break.

To be fair, he’s great with practical stuff and can be supportive when the issue doesn’t involve him directly. We share many interests. But something in me snapped yesterday. 

I’m terrified of being alone. Part of me fears I’m overreacting and will regret leaving — but I can’t keep doing this.

Thanks to anyone who read this. I just needed to get it out.


---

TL;DR:
my husband avoids spending time with me, gets defensive when I express feelings, never apologizes, and refuses to change. Even basic routines like a weekly date or one hour together a day don’t last. I think I’ve finally hit my breaking point but I’m scared.

Turns out the symptoms were caused by bad circulation and nerve pressure due to my spine problems. Then I got covid so even more antibiotics, and then a year later again couple of rounds after I actually got reoccurent infection in maternity hospital. All those times I was taking probiotics.

Anyways, since then I have problems with digestion. I'm constantly bloated no matter what I eat and often have cramps in my stomach. Normally I have two number 2s in the morning, but sometimes I got constipated for several days. This is often when I eat combination of pasta or some kind of dough with meat, so I try to avoid those as much as I can.

I generally eat okay-ish, could be better but:

- I use small amounts of organic, cold pressed oil and never deep fry food,
- Rarely eat bread, and when I do I try to eat homemade sourdough bread. But I like pasta :(
- We use organic grains, milk and eggs. We try to buy higher quality and organic produce whenever we can. We also buy meat from very specific butcher shops that have better quality meat
- I switched from yoghurt to kefir and use milk only for sauces and doughs
- I use a lot of vegetables and whole foods - the only processed foods I use in the kitchen are mostly pasta, sour cream and cheese.
- I snack only when I'm in pms.

I like intermittent fasting, I usualy eat between 1 and 9pm. Before that just water and black coffee (two espressos daily).

I tried simeticone supplements, but they don't work for me anymore. A month ago I've discovered a suplement with probiotics, prebiotics, bromelain and enzymes which helped a lot, but since it's currently out of stock I will try with just digestive enzymes.

1olm968,https://www.reddit.com/r/DispatchAdHoc/comments/1olm968/tips_for_perfect_ch_3_and_4_shifts/,Tips for Perfect Ch 3 and 4 shifts.,"I’ve noticed some people struggle with the first shifts of ch3 and 4 so I wanted to share some tips that helped me on my repeat runs on my alt saves. I have managed to get perfect ch 3 and 4 runs on multiple saves now and it’s honestly not that difficult with prior knowledge and knowing the synergy mechanic. I won’t go too into assignments since everyone builds differently making everyone’s optimal assignments different. You can look up which events are autocompleted by which hero though no cheating on the first run :). In fact, leave now if you haven’t experienced your first run blind yet and suffer as I have.

For building, generally choose 2 main stats and a sub stat for each hero to level. Each hero already starts with decent spreads and it’s safe to follow them. Currently it’s not a good idea hyper specialize into a single stat, but this may change in the future chapters.

My suggestions:
Sonar: int/cha (com)
Flambe: mob/com (vig) (the supernova talent makes this redundant so honestly build him however)
Inv: int/mob (com/cha)
Punch: com/vig (cha)
Cardi C: cha/int (com)
Mal: works well as a jack of all with sonar vig/mob/com(cha)
Gol: works well as a jack of all with upgraded talents vig/mob/com (cha)
Coupe: don’t matter just cut her (jk int/com/mob)
Water boy: int/mob (vig) He is a blank canvas you can use to cover for who you cut.
Autistic Depressed Superman: The guy is rank 12, 2 ranks above the max rank 10 for everyone else. You ain’t changing his build and he doesn’t level, just try and get him a therapist.

Ultimately take these recommendations with a grain of salt and play how you want. Personally I like building them according to their powers so I hate having to spec golem into mobility despite needing a vigor/mobility hero.

Ideally in ch 3 you would want to get a perfect run on the first shift to farm xp to maximize your chances on the second shift. Good sabotage rng can help pick up Punch Up’s and Malevola’s powers if you don’t already have them. You can reset who is randomly assigned by closing and reopening the sabotage menu to get around not being able to reassign heroes to try and get the best 2 heroes for the first job. After the first mission which comes down to rng for one hero, you can mitigate further missions by ONLY assigning synergy pairs to avoid sabotages and ensuring 2 heroes on the harder assignments. Synergy pairs are sonar/mal, inv/gol, flambé/Cardi C, and punch up/coupe. These pairings will not sabotage each other pre mission and provide a boost to success rates. You should be sending them out in these pairs in this chapter anyway to start farming the synergy success bonuses and building them to cover each other. This shift heavily punishes players who don’t take into account the team’s interpersonal relationships and just focuses on ideal mission stat fulfillment, almost guaranteeing only hero makes it instead of two.

You will get some random sabotages on returns and Coupe will always be wounded by Mal but they are easily managed as they happen post mission. You may want to consider to intentionally fail sonar, to send him out again with malevola, or punch up to give him an injury here if they are sabotaged. (I am 70% sure Sonar will always be sabotaged.) Sonar does have a mission where he is paired with coupe and sabotages her, he has a good chance of success in him base form and unharmed. Keep that in mind when deciding to purposely fail or send him out before this mission.

For ch4 shift one, the best way to increase your chance  at a perfect run is to carefully manage mission completion timings.  New missions pop up after missions are completed, not at specific times. You can manipulate mission spawns. This means you can WAIT to handle yellow check marks when your heroes can return and rest. This comes in clutch for ch4 when you are stretched thin. For example the moving and assembling furniture follow up missions only spawn once you click confirm on the yellow checkmark of the previous mission, allowing you to fully rest whomever you are sending. You don’t have to rush to complete every mission as that is ultimately detrimental by having the next set of missions spawn when the rest timers are still active. The trickiest management is with the missions requiring intervention. In the first trio of missions you can send flambé solo to rescue the driver, and resolve it first since he has a special option, allowing him to rest early so he can recover before the next mission at the game store expires where you send him again without having to use the coffee. The game store mission pops up after you complete either the cult investigation, stadium brawl, or rescue. You can experience vastly different results based on the order and timing you handle dispatches in this shift.

For power ups, I recommend Golem for ch 3 and Invis for ch 4. I managed to get Invis to rank 10 by ch 4 using her double xp power and golem’s upgrades are great when you can only spare 1 hero. Getting flambé supernova early is also good as you can invest in other stats than mobility and combat, making him arguably the strongest hero stat wise.

Hope everyone can make use of these tips as they replay chapters for alternate runs, and if anyone has any run optimization tips to share too please share. We are gonna have to replay these chapters so many times to experience all the paths and I want to make them as painless as possible.

My psychologist seemed very interested in whether or not I ever drank alone, and I said i did sometimes.

I thought this was interesting because I hadn’t thought of any of these things in relation to my (potential) ADHD, and wondered if my consumption habits have anything to do with my attention problems. 

What can these questions reveal about the patient and their potential ADHD diagnosis? Do ADHDers have a particular relationship with these substances or addictions? ",1,1761998688.0,adhdwomen,3,1.0,False

We’re surrounded by machines that all think they’re the main character. And yet, we keep buying more. I saw someone on Alibaba selling a smart toothbrush that tracks your brushing performance. I wouldn’t have believed such would be possible years back.

I even find a strange satisfaction in waiting all day for an Amazon delivery, like that’s my one big event. It’s funny how doing nothing can still feel like something.

1olm0eq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Semenretention/comments/1olm0eq/14_months/,14 MONTHS,"Hey guys,

So this end of October completes my 14 months of SR and 10 months of not consciously accessing any pornographic material. This would not have been completed without the constant support and testimonies of other fellow retainers in this sub. I believe you must have read my previous posts at various interval throughout this journey.

This post I want to talk about something different. I want to talk about benefits and things which I don’t like about receiving those benefits

1)      Female attraction: I have encountered many instances of female attraction. In beginning I enjoy them a lot but later I realized these attraction instances were from those women with whom I don’t want anything.

 For eg from married women or young age women ( early twenties). I follow a very strict principle where I deliberately avoid escalating anything romantically with any married women. I cannot break somebodies home in order to built mine. Little bit super casual conversation or flirting is okayish but the moment I realize it is escalating I just remove myself.

 Or for eg when any young women early twenties tries to flirt I just don’t care. I am 34 now , there is no point of me flirting with any 21 year old college student. I am waiting for someone my age or older. Which certainly never happens as the older ones are usually married .

 

2)      Hatred from others: I do enjoy, when people who looked me down in my coomer days now ,secretly hate me by seeing my progress in these last 14 months. But there other people with whom I’ve never met are also showing hatred for no reason .

For eg I have been rejected in interviews atleast 4 times for no reason despite showing competence.

3)      Stamina: My stamina and endurance has increased a lot but my Body has not upgraded I guess. For eg I usually fast paced walked for 1.5-2 hours everyday . At the end breathwise I am ok but my legs pains a lot. I want to walk more but my body refuses. Its like a sweet hot pain flows down my body, but overall endurance wise I am same as in during the beginning of my walk.

4)      Decaf: Its been 3 months since I am on totally decaf . My sleep quality has increased substantially but Ever since I quit coffee I have a problem of not recalling things instantly. When I was taking black coffee (6-7 cups daily) my recalling power were extremely sharp. But now it takes usually 2-3 minutes for things to come in my memory. One of the reasons I failed in one of interview as I was unable to recall the answer immediately within 5-10 seconds. I remember the answer after 1 minute but by then the interviewer has moved to next question.

 

5)      Dreams:  ever since quitting coffee my sleep quality has increased substantially and so does my dreams. The quality of dreams is like ultra 4hdk. I can even read things in my dreams. It’s so real that sometimes I wake up confused. It takes a few minutes for me to come into reality. Also even if take afternoon nap for 30-45 minutes I have an intense dream. These dreams can range in a pretty wide spectrum FROM a male demon trying to fuck me TO playing with a super cute family of snow leopards in my home which nearby a desert. I believe I need to start a dream journal

 

6)      Alcohol: we know that watching porn bring us extreme bad luck in our lifes . Now same is started to happens with me with alcohol. Uptill age 31 I used to have beer at every weekend with my gang. But suddenly 3 years ago I quit cold turkey. Now , whenever I take even a single can of light beer on some special occasion or gathering, I experienced that it brings unnecessary bad luck in a way. This intensity of bad luck is small but it always coincides with me drinking beer.

So these are some of the things which I am experiencing. If anyone has any insight please do share.

Also below are the few more instances which happens since my last post

a)       My friend’s wife message me from her personal whatsapp number to her son’s B’day party. Weird thing Her husband already invited me out a week before. I’ve known her and her husband from last 20 years. I’ve been to all their family functions but it’s always my friend who used to invite me definitely not her.

 

b)      One of my classmates with whom I’ve been in touch with only on phone after passing school in 2009. She suddenly calls to meet me for coffee last week. I went and she kept inquiring about my lovelife ( which is non-existent)

 

c)       The park where I walk in the evening I can literally see women who are coming from opposite direction starts walking in a converging course. Sometime I have to correct course to avoid collision. I live in a women centric conservative society where male is always at fault despite womens mistake.

 

d)      One of the strange thing I have experienced ,  is that  Bad things have started to happen to people who have wronged ( cheated) me deliberately,  especially after I started my SR. when I say bad things means they are visibly disturbed and shaken by it. The strange thing is the are telling me about it by themselves only.

 

I want to share something which came in my mind suddenly without any precognition. I feel like I do want to share.

Pareto principle states that 80 /20 rule. Out of 100 people its always divided into 80/20.

80 are average and 20 are extreme. Now I believe this 20 can be further divided in 10-10 each

10: with whom always good happens in their life no matter what they do. They will always succeed no matter how bad they themselves are or how bad the situation can be. The are those you typical ( Good things happens to bad guys)

10: these are complete opposite of first ten. Always bad is going to happen to them .No matter how good they themselves are or how good the situation can be. These are your typically ( why bad things happens to good guys)

80:  These are the remaining people whose luck (karma) are solely defined by the deeds which they do. They will get success if they do hard work and they will fail if they are not disciplined.

So that’s it for me then

KEEP CALM AND KEEP RETAINING.

1ollzv2,https://www.reddit.com/r/SmallBizTalk/comments/1ollzv2/sustainable_small_business_tips_that_actually/,Sustainable Small Business Tips That Actually Make Money in 2025,"**Sustainable isn’t a buzzword—it’s a profit lever.** 

I run a two-person design studio. 

In 2023, we were “eco-friendly” because it felt right. 

In 2025, we’re **profitable because it’s smart:**

* 37% of our clients require sustainable vendors in RFPs.
* Waste dropped 68% → $4,200/year saved on materials.
* “Green” social posts get 3.2× engagement → free marketing.

Here are 9 sustainable small business tips that cut costs, boost revenue, and don’t require a trust fund. No virtue-signaling, just numbers.

  
**1. Start with “Waste = Money” Audit (Free, 2 Hours).** 

Print last month’s expenses. Circle anything that ends up in a landfill. My 2024 audit finds:

|Item|Monthly Cost|Landfill %|Fix|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Single-use mockup prints|$180|100%|→ Digital PDFs + 1 reusable foam board|
|Coffee pods|$72|90%|→ Local roaster bulk beans (-$41/mo)|
|Shipping fillers|$94|100%|→ Customer’s old newspaper (free)|

**Result:** $1,800/year saved. Paid for my solar-powered laptop in 4 months.

  
**2. Sell the Scrap, Don’t Trash It.** 

Case study: “ScrapWood Studio” (Etsy, 2025)  
Woodworker in Boise turns offcuts into $28 keychains.

* Cost: $0 (waste)
* Revenue: $2,400/month
* Bonus: Ships in recycled mailers → 4.9-star reviews for “eco-packaging”

Your move: List 3 “upcycled” SKUs this week. 

Price 40% below the premium line. Watch margins soar.

  
**3. Switch to “Closed-Loop” Suppliers (They Pay You Back)**

**2025 example:** MOO Cards “Carbon Neutral+”

* You order business cards on recycled stock.
* They plant a tree and send you a scannable QR report.
* You add the QR to your email footer → 11 new leads/month from “curious clicks.”

Pro tip: Ask suppliers for case studies you can repost. Free content + social proof.

  
**4. Run a “Bring-Back” Loyalty Program,** 

Coffeeshop win (Portland, 2025):

* Return clean mug → free drip refill.
* Result: 2,300 mugs reused/month → $0 on disposables.
* App tracks “trees saved” → customers share screenshots → 400 new followers/month.

Your version:

* Boutique → Return tissue paper for 10% off.
* Bakery → Return tins for a free cookie.

**5. Use AI to Cut Energy Waste (Not Just Content)**

**2025 tool:** “GridWise” (free tier)

* Plugs into smart meter.
* Texts “Run heat press at 2 pm, rates 38% lower.”
* Saved: $180/month on 3D printing studio.

Pair with:

* LED motion sensors (payback <6 months)
* Smart plugs on non-essential gear

**6. Turn Sustainability into Your Niche Story** 

**2025 example:** “Zero Waste Chef Kits”  
Meal-prep service in Seattle:

* Ingredients in returnable glass jars.
* $179/week plan.
* Retention: 91% (national avg: 62%)
* Hook: “We pick up jars when we deliver next week.”

They beat HelloFresh locally by owning the jar.

  
7. Get Free Press with “Impact Reports” 

Every quarter, post a 60-second Reel:

“This quarter, we saved 1,200 plastic bottles. Here’s how.” 

Result:

* Local news pickup (zero ad spend)
* 3 B2B clients added “sustainability” to vendor criteria → you win.

8. Partner with “Green” Micro-Influencers. 

Find TikTok creators with <10k followers in your niche.

  
Offer:

* Free product
* 50% affiliate cut
* Their content is reused on your Google Business Profile

Case study: Plant shop + “Apartment Garden Gal” (6k followers)  
→ 1 Reel = 43 new customers in 48 hours.

  
**9. Apply for Grants** 

You’re Already Qualified For 2025 programs (still open):

|Grant|Amount|Eligibility|Link|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|USDA Rural Energy for America|Up to $20k|Solar/LED upgrades|[usda.gov/reap](http://usda.gov/reap)|
|Shopify Sustainability Fund|$5k|<50 employees|[shopify.com/sustainability](http://shopify.com/sustainability)|
|Local “Green Business” Rebates|$500–$2k|Varies by city|Search “\[city\] green business grant”|

I got $2,100 for LED studio lights. Paid a freelancer for 3 weeks.  
Quick-Start Checklist (Do This Week)

* Audit waste → kill 1 expense
* Launch 1 upcycled product
* Add “returnable” option to 1 service
* Post 1 “impact” stat on social
* Apply to 1 grant

Bottom Line: Sustainable = lower costs + higher loyalty + better marketing. In 2025, customers don’t pay more for green—they pay you for smart. Pick one tip. Implement tomorrow. Watch the numbers move.

Thought I would finally post here. I am a bit of a night time wanderer who enjoys quiet walks around Brisbane after long days.

I recently graduated from QUT and work with Telstra. Between work and side projects I tend to stay pretty busy (sometimes seven days a week), but I still make time for things I love — sports, baking (my banana cake gets good reviews 🍌), and movies.

I have never really been on social media and have always preferred real conversations or exploring new places over scrolling. Lately I have been watching a lot of films, and I can recommend a few good must watches — horror is my favorite genre 👻.

Always keen to meet genuine people around Brisbane — for a walk, movie chat, or late night coffee :)

I feel free that every time something reminds me of you, tinatawanan ko na lang.

1ollyh1,https://i.redd.it/4qdbqyc9xmyf1.jpeg,"30 days to CAT ,running on caffeine, anxiety, and hope ☕","So yeah ,30 days left.
Mocks are destroying my confidence, Quant is exposing my IQ and somehow VARC still feels like reading ancient poetry in another language :)

One day I’m like “IIM A, here I come!” and the next mock humbles me so hard I start googling government jobs and MBA alternatives 🥲

But honestly, I’ve realized this last month isn’t about learning new things anymore ,it’s about keeping my sanity intact.
Here’s the plan:
	4-5 RCs a day (with minimal tears).
	4-5 DILR set (preferably ones that don’t make me cry).
	25 Quant questions daily just to remind myself numbers still exist.
	3-4 mocks a week, with painful but necessary analysis sessions.

And most importantly ,sleep well, eat actual food, and stop comparing scores with people who seem to solve LR sets for fun 😭

At this point, CAT prep feels like a mix of trauma and character development but hey, we’ve survived this far.
So let’s push through the next 30 days with a little chaos, a little faith and a lot of coffee. ☕❤️

We got this, folks. Not perfectly but bravely. 💪

 “So… you are a smuggler?”, Ellie asked.

“Yes”, Matt replied idly.

“Have you smuggled little girls before?”

Matt hated the curiosity in kids. It irritated him and made him uncomfortable. With his daughter Gabi nothing was awkward. She was special - acting mature, learning fast, making him laugh… She was everything he wished for and… then in just a moment of chaos… he lost her. A part of him died that night.

“Hello? I asked you a question. Are you still mad about the deal?”

Matt’s breath hitched and he scratched his head.

“I don't smuggle people. You must be very important. Rich family?”,

Matt frowned. ‘How would she come from money when she looks like a damn orphan’

“No… I don't know. My parents died when I was born. Marlene hadn't told me anything”

“So what is it?”, Matt opened the metal door, leading to the stairs.

“I…I don't know”, her head drooped.

Matt opened the door to the apartment 3B and turned to Ellie.

“Listen, I don't care. I want no more questions.”, Matt ordered.

She nodded and went inside.

Matt cursed silently.

‘God i hate this job’

This innocent girl didn't even know who she was and why she was being transported. He didn't even bother to ask her name.

‘Whatever. Just get her to the Fireflies and retrieve the guns. Simple enough.’

He closed the door and leaned on it. The fatigue sank in his bones. It was a long day. He needed sleep at least until Tess arrived. His eyes drifted across the big room. Silence. But it was a comforting silence. The curtains hung unevenly but they were clean and decorated in a modern style. The walls were off-white with old nail holes and faded patches. Bookshelves - mostly empty or lined with items like broken photo frames. The wooden table seemed stable and barely damaged with just a single, dusty ashtray. In the kitchen a stovetop rusted around the burners was still working and clean dishes sat stacked in a rack. A faint scent of coffee and dust hung in the air. It started raining outside and Matt yawned. He crept towards the threadbare sofa draped with a somewhat clean blanket and sprawled on it heavily.

“What are you doing?”, Ellie questioned carefully.

Matt adjusted his position for comfort and let out a long-waited sigh of relief.

“Killin’ time”,

“And what am I supposed to do?”, her voice carried a note of worry.

“I am sure you will figure that out”, and with that he closed his eyes and a rhythmic low snore came out of his mouth.

 

 

 

 

Matt opened his eyes and knew something was off. He glanced around. The arcade. The abandoned arcade in the old basement. A surprise for Gabi’s birthday that had left a pleasant, warm memory in Matt’s heart. He knew he had nailed it, judging by the happiness that had radiated from her when she was running around the arcade cabinets and claw machines. The walls were old and stained, undecorated. The floor had been dusty even back then and bare concrete always gave the place a strange echo, almost creepy despite the joy it held. There was only one window and it was useless. It could not open and the outside was not visible anyways. There were lamps lined on the ceiling but only a few of them flickered in the cavernous dark. A musty, mineral tang rose from the broken ceiling tile. The smell of rot and meadow was absent though. ‘Honestly a well-kept but worn arcade’, murmured Matt in his thoughts. But the best thing so far – Silence. Peaceful, almost breathtaking stillness that was a treat to his intense and troubled life recently. Gabi also complained constantly about the lively street they were living on. This place was a dream come true. A distant voice came from one of the vending machines. That was his favorite because it held cold, refreshing beer. And Matt adored it. Especially after a long day of work… it’s hard to beat. He strolled over to the machine. Gabi stood there with a can in hand and a smirk on her face.

“Consider your actions young lady”, his tone was playful, yet it carried a subtle warning.

“Oh, come on! I see you drink that thing almost every evening and the face you make is like…”, she closed her eyes and relaxed her face. “It better be the best drink ever…”

“No, Gabi! Last warning. If you…”, he paused.

Gabi sipped loudly and made a grimace.

“Hmm… tastes like burnt metal and regret”, she took another one but spilled it out.

“I swear… y-you have to… be t-the greatest actor in the world because I would rather drink my pee…”, she uttered while coughing.

Matt raised an eyebrow, feigning deep disappointment.

“Well, there goes the family legacy. Thought I raised you better.”

Gabi wiped her mouth and rolled her eyes.  
“Yeah, sorry to disappoint. Guess I won’t be the alcoholic in the family.”

Matt chuckled and took the can from her and began drinking.

“What are you doi-…”

Matt raised his finger. He nodded with confidence. Thirty seconds passed. Finally he burped and threw the empty cans on the ground. A sharp stink of beer clung to the dense air. Matt gazed back at Gabi.

“Well, what do you think?”

Gabi gaped at her father with open mouth.

“Absolutely fucking disgusting”

“If you swear one more time we are leaving”, Matt’s words were sharp.

“Says the guy who is burping like a swine on my birthday”,

Matt wandered over to the driving simulators and caressed the steering wheel.

“How about you learn how to drive a damn car?”,

“A dad teaching his daughter something useful. Would you look at that”, Gabi sprinted with excitement.

“I’d say the beer lesson was better”, he muttered.

She didn’t hear him. Her attention was locked on the simulator.

Matt leaned behind her like a coach.

“Alright. Hands at ten and two. Or, you know, wherever, since you're about to drive in a virtual post-apocalyptic hellscape”

Gabi smirked, gripping the dusty wheel. “Ten and two. Got it. Like a surgeon, right?”

“More like a drunk surgeon,” he muttered. “Now foot on the brake.”

Gabi slammed it with full force. The simulator screamed, the engine coughed with old synthesized sound effects.

“Easy! It’s a driving lesson, not a demolition derby.”

“Sorry! It’s sensitive.”

Matt leaned in, adjusting her hands. “Okay, gas is on the right. You press it gently, not like you're stomping a roach.”

 

She nodded and tapped the pedal. The pixelated car lurched forward and swerved into a row of cones.

 

“Impressive,” Matt deadpanned. “First casualty — the parking lot.”

“Didn’t like those cones anyway.”

Matt smiled. “Alright, try again. Straight line, no crimes committed this time.

She had practiced for hours back then. And finally came the culmination. Matt watched tensely, his eyes had dried out, hurting, almost closed. But still he could glimpse that Gabi was almost perfect.

“Keep going! A little bit to the right! Not that much, okay just calm down, deep breath. You got it”, Matt couldn’t endure it anymore. He blinked.

Gabi had made it. The simulator screeched happily and she struck him with cocky eyes. He was proud.

“You will always be next to me right daddy?”, her tone suddenly changed. It carried fear. The silence was broken by emergency sirens and the flickering lights on the ceiling had turned into red and blue. Distant screams resounded in the room. He glanced at Gabi again. She looked scared now.

“Will you protect me”

The last words echoed in his mind and he panicked. Then he woke up. His body jolted and he screamed his daughter’s name.

“Who is Gabi?”, Ellie sat on a wooden chair next to the kitchen stove. She was staring at him oddly. Matt realized. He had a nightmare and Ellie had heard him murmur in his sleep.

“Ugh, it’s not your concern”, his voice came out more rude than he intended and Ellie turned back to the window. It was raining outside and the morning sun was spearing through the curtains. It was time. The front door cracked and Tess snuck in.

“You two okay?”

Matt nodded and turned to Ellie. No reaction. The girl was just gawping into nothingness, her head tilted to the side, the hands relaxed on her knees.

Tess struck him a sharp gaze and raised an eyebrow but Matt just shrugged. An awkward silence settled in the cozy room.

Through non-verbal communication they came to an agreement.

Tess coughed.

“Guns secured. Mosque is not far and we better get going”, with these words she gazed at Ellie. “Hey…uhm… little girl we have to go”,

Ellie finally broke her incredible stillness and gave a faint nod.

When I went to take a shower this morning, my hostel supply had scalding hot water and quite literally have myself first degree burn. I also had a sore throat and cold. During my routine work, I had muscle pull on my right calf. All of this happened before 2 pm here's how it turned around from here.

Then I went for my classes and I met up with my friends - I had bought myself a chocolate so I shared it with one of my girl friends who was there early alongside me. Our other friend came along, she was meeting up with some other friend of hers in the college canteen so by the time she came we were almost finished with the chocolate, just one last bite was left. We both showed her that, mock offering her then ate it to tease her. All in good fun.

We were sitting at the second last bench so we just kept scrolling pinterest and making pins, talking about it, not paying attention to the class, having fun.

Then we went to have burgers from this shop nearby because, my coaching timings are late as hell (6-10) so I had to pack something up for my dinner. 

There we were enjoying our cold coffees and burgers when I accidentally spilled my cold coffee all over my jeans and sandals but it's was very typical of me because I'm clumsy as hell. And if I were alone, this would have ruined my entire week but they made me laugh so much that the spilt coffee was nothing in front of the time I was enjoying with them. 

Then one of them dropped me off. Right now sitting in my hostel room, although I could say that this has been the worst day of the year by far, it is so much better than some of my teenage years combined because now I have friends who can make even days like these so much fun. 

I have cried in front of my mumma for friends like these and now that I have had them for two years I couldn't be more grateful. The fact that we will parting ways at the end of the days gives a bittersweet feeling but makes me cherish days like today even more.",2,1761997497.0,AskIndianWomen,1,1.0,False

1ollp2d,https://i.redd.it/b764wysjumyf1.png,Anyone Here Tried Intermittent Fasting Long-Term? Here’s What I Learned Digging Into the Science,"I’ve been curious about intermittent fasting (IF) for a while — especially since it’s everywhere online, from fitness influencers to doctors claiming it boosts energy and longevity. But after looking into the research, I realized it’s not just another diet trend — it’s more about *when* you eat than *what* you eat.

Here’s what stood out to me 👇

**⏰ What Intermittent Fasting Actually Is**  
It’s a structured eating pattern that cycles between fasting and eating periods. Unlike calorie-restricted diets, IF focuses on giving your body time to rest and repair between meals.

**🔥 Common Methods**

* **16/8 Method:** Fast for 16 hours, eat in an 8-hour window.
* **5:2 Diet:** Eat normally 5 days, restrict calories 2 days.
* **Eat-Stop-Eat:** 24-hour fasts once or twice a week.
* **Alternate-Day Fasting:** Fast every other day (more intense).

**💪 Key Benefits (When Done Right)**

* Promotes **fat burning** and better insulin sensitivity.
* Supports **cell repair and longevity** via autophagy.
* May **improve focus and energy** once your body adapts.
* Can aid **weight loss** by reducing late-night or mindless snacking.

**⚠️ Risks & Side Effects**

* Headaches, fatigue, or irritability in the early days.
* Overeating or choosing poor foods during eating windows.
* Possible hormone imbalances if done too aggressively — especially for women.
* Should be avoided if pregnant, diabetic, or dealing with disordered eating.

**🧠 How to Start Safely**

* Ease in by shortening your eating window gradually.
* Stay hydrated — water, black coffee, or herbal tea are fine.
* Don’t skip nutrition: whole foods, protein, and fiber are essential.
* Listen to your body — if you’re dizzy or overly fatigued, break the fast.

**🏋️‍♀️ Exercise + IF**  
Light workouts or fasted walks work best early on. For strength training, you might want to time it toward the end of your fast or right after your first meal.

From what I’ve seen, some people thrive on IF while others crash and burn. The difference usually comes down to consistency, hydration, and balance.

1ollokx,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnjavascript/comments/1ollokx/julia_gives_the_developer_the_choice_to_use/,"Julia gives the developer the choice to use strong typing or loose one. If JavaScript does the same, would that affect the popularity of TypeScript?","# Julia’s Type Flexibility

Julia lets you choose:

* **Loose typing** → write quick, dynamic code (like Python).
* **Strong typing** → specify concrete types for safety and speed. That flexibility is one of Julia’s strengths — it adapts to both experimentation and production.



# If JavaScript Offered the Same Choice

If JavaScript allowed optional **strong/static typing** built directly into the language (without external tooling like TypeScript), then yes — it would **absolutely reduce TypeScript’s popularity**, possibly by a lot.



# Why That Would Happen

* **TypeScript exists mainly to fill that gap.** JavaScript is dynamic, and TypeScript adds the static typing and compile-time checking developers want for large projects.
* If the **ECMAScript standard** evolved to include optional types natively:
   * Developers wouldn’t need a separate build step.
   * Code would run directly in browsers without transpilation.
   * Tooling (IDEs, linters, debuggers) would unify under one language.

That would make **TypeScript redundant** or merge it back into JavaScript — similar to how **CoffeeScript** faded when ES6 added many of its features.

# In Short

If JavaScript allowed optional static typing the way Julia does, **TypeScript’s separate existence would lose its purpose**, and most developers would simply use the new typed JavaScript.

Doctor can't narrow down a cause and reluctant to continue with shots.","Hello brains trust - I'm having a hard time narrowing this reaction down, and figured someone might have the missing puzzle piece.

B12 supplementation seems to be causing dizzy spells with punching palpitations, muscle weakness, feeling like I am going to pass out, fatigue that will last another couple of days post event. 

 First one was huge. Was taken to hospital after narrowly making it to work and passing out in my car in the car park. I was on the cusp consciousness/un-consciousness for about an hour. Pulse was erratic, erratic breathing, nothing notable from a cardiac perspective, electrolytes were all fine at the hospital blood tests. Had a coffee while in the waiting room which brought back symptoms....this later had me thinking I was dealing with a vagal nerve issue.

I went on to have 3 more events between then and last week. 2 were more mild, the last one was nearly as bad as the first, though I knew how to handle it this time and didn't freak out. 

24 hour cardiac monitoring has also been carried out - Nil issues.

I started having these dizzy spells when I started supplementing all of my cofactors to try and kick start methylation and detox. I've had a really hard time with histamine intolerance which can be led back to my nutritional deficiencies.... Iron and b12 deficient, elevated homocysteine, negligible MMA.

2 of the 4 events have occurred 3 days post b12 shot - and now my doc warned if it happens again she'll cease the shots. 

After the B12 shots, I get a return of otherwise managed reflux/GERD, burping and sever bloating for a couple of days - this indicates a histamine response. 

Part of the reason I'm looking at Vagal nerve, is due to the type of palpitations I was having. there were some obvious skips that I could feel in my chest, that aligned with what was felt in my pulse. Then there were others, much stronger that felt like an extra heartbeat, didn't match my pulse but that could be felt down to my stomach. 

**I keep coming back to the cause having something to do with:** Histamine/Acetylcholine and their complicated relationship with various histamine receptors in the body. Also Acetylcholine's relationship with Potassium and Calcium ion channels that help regulate the heart, and the overall interaction of Acetylcholine on the vagus nerve (Parasympathetic nervous system).

What I can't work out is if I'm low on Ach or producing too much. Thoughts from anyone on how else I might be able to approach this?

The Master replied, ""Sun-Face Buddha, Moon-Face
Buddha.""  On the first day of the second month, after having
taken a bath, he sat cross-legged and passed away.

> Poceski: The names of these two Buddhas appear in the Sutra of
the Buddha Names. The life-span of Sun-face Buddha is said to
one thousand and eight-hundred years, while the life-span of
on-face Buddha is only one day and one night.  This [biographical record] is referenced in Case 3 of BCR.

A friend of mine recently deleted all his socials.  Unlike most redditors, this is a guy who I met IRL.  I travel a lot, and once when I was crossing the US he went way way out of his way to have coffee with me.  He contributed a ton to the wiki, and the podcast, and found books nobody was reading.

What does Moon-face mean?  

It means that none of us have much time.  I'm getting old.  Since I started posting on rZen many years ago, I now can't read without glasses.  When I get sick, I'm sick for longer.  Doctors explain to me that I'm old now.  Most people on social media are young, although that trend is changing.  Getting older means (for some people) that you notice time running out fast.

What's the Zen teaching from this dying old man about the moon for, anyway?

I tell people that Zen Masters don't ask for any insight *we haven't already had*.  What's the insight here?

I suspect it's like sunsets.  Everybody likes a beautiful sunset.  We marvel, we take pictures with our cellphones, and then (if we are lucky) the picture looks good enough to hang out in our memory feeds.

Nobody complains about how long sunsets last.  We all get it.  But recognizing that everything is like a sunset is hard for people.

Not me though.  I'm old, so it's easy.  I think the equally hard thing is accepting that *everything* has a sunset, even ignorance.

Accepting that there is going to be an end to ignorance is something else that seems hard for people.

How to hold love the way sunlight holds dust,
quietly, reverently,
as if touching too hard might make it disappear.
You taught me that presence could be a prayer,
that love didn’t need fireworks,
only two people brave enough to whisper I’m still here.
And then one day,
you weren’t.

Now I live inside the contradiction you left behind.
You were the anchor and the tide,
the hand that steadied me
and the wind that let me go.
I keep trying to remember the way you breathed beside me,
how you made silence sound like safety,
but memory is cruel.
It keeps changing your voice
until it sounds like apology.

I still trace the spaces where you used to exist
the way rivers remember old banks,
curving toward ghosts they can’t refill.
I walk through days that don’t know your name anymore
and nights that still ache for the rhythm of your laughter.
It’s strange how time moves
like a blade wrapped in silk,
soft until it cuts.

I’ve built a thousand versions of you in my mind,
each one leaving differently,
each one smiling as if they mean it this time.
You live inside my chest like unfinished music,
a melody that ends mid breath,
and I keep humming the silence that follows.
You taught me love was a language,
but never told me how to speak it alone.

And maybe that’s the curse of being loved by someone like you
you turned the ordinary into proof of something holy.
Now every cup of coffee tastes like a confession,
every dawn feels like a lie I keep forgiving.
The air still smells like your goodbye.
It sits heavy on my tongue,
like rain trying to remember the sky it fell from.

You taught me how to stay,
how to wait,
how to believe that patience was its own kind of devotion.
So here I am,
still practicing the lesson you gave me,
still staying
long after you stopped asking me to.

And if you ever wonder
whether I learned anything at all,
just know this
I did.
I learned that love is a teacher who never comes back to class,
that staying can hurt worse than leaving,
and that sometimes the most faithful thing a heart can do
is break beautifully
in your name.

I feel like my heart is under a million kilos of heaviness sometimes.

I started to go out for coffee with this man, I thought that he was very good looking. Nothing more at the beginning, I thought it could have been some nice sexual thing.

But something absolutely unexpected happened.

We start to talk. Deeply. Always more deeply. And he doesn't have only a beautiful face, he has a wonderful soul.

We start to hang out a lot, like 2/3 times a week, sometimes every day. We started to do nice stuff together. We started to help each other in the little struggle of life. And we talk for hours, we can sit in a bar and talk for 5 hours no problem.

If I try to hug him or touch him he doesn't do anything, he pulls back a little.

Well, months passed. We built a pretty solid friendship. I trust him, he trusts me and he admires me and talks very well about me with other people.

Sometimes we did pretty romantic stuff.

He had plenty of occasions to kiss me or something, he never did.

Well... months passed and I absolutely felt in love with him like I never did in my life before.

I would like to tell him... but I'm scared. I'm scared to ruin the beautiful friendship that we have, it is so rare. I'm afraid that he says that he does feel anything. That he sees me just as a friend. (But in that case why he is spending so much time with me? Why he does all that nice stuff with me?).

But I think that he doesn't like me back, in all these months he could have kissed me. I would like to try to kiss him but I don't feel that he gives me the space and I'm scared.

But he is amazing. I never felt such a deep connection with a man.

What to do? I tell him?
Like ""Have you ever thought that this can be something more?""

I would like to know opinions.

My friends say to not tell him. To not risk to ruin something beautiful just because I'm in love, that it will pass. They tell me to enjoy the beautiful time I have with him without wanting him.

Yesterday night we were at a party, we were dancing and he was so beautiful that I wanted just to hug him and never let him go. I love him.

1. The Awakening

It starts one morning. Elon Musk doesn’t reach for his phone to check Tesla stock; instead, he looks at his reflection and feels… guilty. Jeff Bezos, sipping his oat milk latte in a glass dome somewhere in the desert, realizes that a single Amazon warehouse worker shouldn’t need two jobs and painkillers to survive. The Walton family, heirs to Walmart, have a meeting where no one says “profit margin” — instead, they say, “how many families can we save from poverty this quarter?”

The billionaires have awakened, not into a new economy, but a new morality.


---

2. Redistribution, Not Charity

First change? The end of performative charity. No more photo ops with hungry kids. Instead, they start restructuring ownership itself.

Every billionaire converts at least half their wealth into a universal equity fund — an automated global dividend paid directly to every adult on Earth through a verified ID system. You wake up to find a message on your phone:

> “You’ve received 540 Universal Credits from the Humanity Equity Trust.”



Suddenly, every person on Earth has a safety net. The slums of Mumbai begin transforming into small-business hubs. Families in rural Africa install solar panels and irrigation systems. Homelessness plummets. The “starving artist” trope? Extinct.

The psychological impact alone is enormous — people start creating, not just surviving.


---

3. The Great Corporate Makeover

Apple announces that it’s now a worker-owned cooperative. Employees receive profit shares, and factory workers in China become shareholders. Amazon’s new CEO (a former warehouse worker) announces that drones will deliver hope, not burnout: shorter hours, living wages, free healthcare.

Oil companies dissolve their drilling divisions and transform into renewable-energy empires overnight. Imagine BP and Shell competing to heal the planet faster than the other.

The stock market shakes, wobbles, and… stabilizes. Investors realize sustainable, fair models actually create long-term growth. Turns out, ethics pay dividends too.


---

4. Healthcare Without a Price Tag

Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, and a coalition of reformed pharma billionaires launch OpenMed: an open-source medical research and global healthcare network. Insulin becomes free. Cancer treatments cost what toothpaste used to.
Entire hospitals are rebuilt with sustainable materials. Doctors in low-income countries are paid as much as their counterparts in New York or Zurich.

No one dies because they couldn’t afford help. That single shift reshapes the human experience more than any invention in history. People stop fearing sickness as a death sentence — and start living longer, richer, fuller lives.


---

5. The Climate Revolution

Then comes the environmental tsunami — but a good one.

Every private jet, every megayacht, every wasteful vanity project is either sold, repurposed, or dismantled for renewable infrastructure. Billionaires pool their resources to create a global carbon-negative economy within a decade.

Musk redirects all of SpaceX’s focus to developing atmospheric scrubbers. Bezos funds reforestation projects that literally cool the planet from orbit.

And oh, imagine this: Greta Thunberg, once mocked, becomes an advisor on a planetary restoration council — with real power. Coral reefs bloom back to color, and extinct species are reintroduced through ethical biogenetics.

Earth exhales. Finally.


---

6. The End of Exploitation

The textile billionaires shut down sweatshops. Instead, they open worker-led design studios across developing nations — fair pay, safety, education, creativity. The result? Fashion becomes sustainable, stylish, and truly global.

Tech billionaires dismantle the algorithmic addictions they built. Social media shifts from dopamine traps to empathy networks — places to share ideas, learn, grow, not doom-scroll.

Children aren’t fed ads; they’re fed education. The attention economy evolves into the enlightenment economy.


---

7. Cities of Light

With unlimited funds and genuine hearts, billionaires fund cities built not on concrete and greed but on compassion.

Urban planning focuses on walkability, greenery, mental health, and access to nature. Skyscrapers have farms instead of billboards. The poorest person in town has the same air quality and view as the richest.

Homeless shelters turn into transition homes with job training and psychological support. Public transport runs on clean energy, is free, and actually smells nice. Imagine that.


---

8. Education Without Borders

Education — the great equalizer — finally becomes free and universal. Zuckerberg (after a long, much-needed apology tour) converts Meta’s infrastructure into a Global Learning Network, offering interactive, AI-guided education in every language.

A child in a refugee camp learns quantum computing from the same platform as a teen in Tokyo. University degrees no longer depend on money or geography. Creativity becomes the new currency.


---

9. Politics Without Puppets

When money stops manipulating politics, democracy… actually works. Billionaires stop funding campaigns and start funding transparency.

Lobbying becomes illegal; instead, a public blockchain tracks all government spending. Corruption, starved of dark money, withers. Leaders rise based on merit and service, not sponsorship.

Even military spending drops — because when resources are shared, wars lose their economic motive.


---

10. The Human Renaissance

Within two decades, humanity enters what historians would call The Second Enlightenment. Not born from science or conquest — but from compassion.

Art flourishes again. People write, sing, build, and dream freely. Poverty drops to near-zero. Crime declines as desperation evaporates. Nature recovers.

For the first time, humans look up at the stars — not with hunger for conquest, but gratitude for existence. Space travel continues, but now with a unified goal: to preserve, not plunder.

And in this world, “billionaire” isn’t a dirty word anymore. It becomes a symbol — a reminder of what happens when power finally remembers its purpose: to protect, not to profit.


---

Epilogue: The Morning After

Imagine you’re walking outside one morning in this new world.
The air is crisp, the sky clear. The woman selling fruit at the corner owns her stall and her future. Children laugh because their parents aren’t exhausted. News anchors report on breakthroughs, not tragedies.

And as you sip your coffee, you check your universal dividend and see your next community project funded automatically. You smile. Because finally, the system loves you back.

If billionaires woke up good tomorrow, we wouldn’t just have a better economy…
We’d have a better humanity.",2,1761995563.0,ChatGPT,3,0.75,False

I'm 27 and she's 24. Our relationship broke down twice, each time after about a year. Last year, after our second breakup, we didn’t talk for a month, then I invited her for coffee and told her I wanted to win her back. Over time, it worked — she saw a change in me and we got back together after about a month.

Now the same thing happened again. We broke up, and it’s been about two weeks of no contact. She suggested staying friends, but I know that would just be a mental trap — she would get over me faster because I’d still be around, while I’d just suffer because I can’t have her fully.

The breakup was peaceful — I wanted to continue, but she said our values and mindset are different. I want a family, she’s focused on her career (she works two jobs). She felt I was pressuring her for more time together — in a month we saw each other only about five times, since it’s a long-distance relationship and we’re both in our final year of university.

She also said we should’ve tried living together earlier, but I was too focused on school (I had 14 courses). Now I’ve started working part-time as well, like her, but she said it’s too late.

After the breakup she sent me a few Reels and even texted asking how I felt. She said things like “maybe we deserve better partners” or “if you’re unhappy, break up with me,” but I think that was more a defense mechanism. She even said she had a mental breakdown the day after the breakup, but later said she’s a “rock.”

We recently exchanged our things — I told her I respect her decision but that I’d be open to a third chance if life gave us one. She said she wouldn’t want that, but I’m not sure she truly meant it.

Intimacy was also an issue — she’s asexual, but I always told her I cared more about emotional connection than sex. I think I’ve been a patient and understanding partner, and I still feel like I want to try again — but I don’t know what to do now.",1,1761995388.0,ExNoContact,2,1.0,False

Here’s what an AI Auditor *actually* does for your business:

* **Spot the waste**: We review your workflows — the follow-ups that never happened, the messages unanswered, the data entered twice. Then we ask: “What if this were automatic?” Research shows AI can turn huge volumes of data into insights much faster than manual methods.

* **Translate tech into cash/time saved**: You don’t need to know “how” — you just need to know it *will*.

Last night though, I was slightly annoyed.  I'm not sure if I was right to be annoyed though.

This was our first dinner date after a coffee date to meet.

Guy initially suggested a restaurant south of him when I'm quite a bit north of him.  My drive time would have been significant on a Friday night with traffic (maybe an hour and 20 min) so I suggested an area in the middle with several restaurant options and said his pick.  Trying to be flexible since I shot down his initial suggestion.

He picks the second most expensive place there and they were not that differently priced.  He booked it without consulting me and just sends me the reservation and time.  Wasn't consulted on time either.  At this point I'm thinking he's probably paying.

We sit down and get asked what type of water we want and without consulting me, he orders bottled water.  Ok, I'm thinking big spender, he's paying.  I would have ordered tap.

Since I think he's paying, I do the, ""what are you thinking"" for the entree and match the price.  He ends up doing a cheaper entree so I follow suit even though I wanted a more expensive one.

Then he accepts my offer to split the check.

With the two bottles of water and two glasses of wine and dessert he ended up ordering, my cost was $95.  When I ordered one glass of wine, a split appetizer and pasta.  We split dessert but he wanted to order.

Would you be annoyed?

  
ETA:  Financially, I'm fine with the cost.  It is a restaurant I would go to on my own.  If I knew we were splitting, I absolutely would have gotten the more expensive entree, which was $25 more.

I'm just annoyed at how he went about it in regards to the original location then the decisions that contributed to the cost of the evening without being consulted.",0,1761995238.0,datingoverfifty,17,0.33,False

1oll2o5,https://www.reddit.com/r/fednews/comments/1oll2o5/as_shutdown_hits_onemonth_mark_federal_workers/,"As shutdown hits one-month mark, federal workers are not okay: Missed paychecks and mounting bills are causing people to fall behind on rent and go hungry across the nation. | WP","The government has been closed for a full month — and federal workers who have missed two paychecks are now using credit cards to pay their bills, visiting food pantries to stock their kitchens and reviewing their bank accounts, plotting exactly how long they can manage without a salary.

The answer is not much longer for Cynthia Brown, a Government Publishing Office staffer who has been working without pay. The 53-year-old said she is barely eating, subsisting on coffee and protein shakes.

She has already sold everything she could find in her house, including two old iPhones, and started a GoFundMe to help cover her expenses. She had hoped to drive for DoorDash to supplement her income, but her car was repossessed after she missed a loan deadline because of the shutdown.

Brown spends her days ensuring that the government keeps a record of congressional proceedings, so she has closely followed the debate around reopening. And that has only made her situation — and the nation’s — feel more dire, she said: “It is going nowhere. That is what scares me. They are not making any progress.”

Starting to cry, Brown added, “They hate each other so much, and we — we are just caught in the middle.”

Federal funds ran out Oct. 1 after lawmakers failed to approve an extension as Democrats and Republicans clashed over health care policy. Democratic lawmakers want to extend subsidies for Affordable Care Act health insurance plans before they will agree to reopen the government. Republicans say they won’t negotiate on health care until the government has reopened.

Starting this weekend, the impasse [will also generate direct consequences for millions of Americans](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/10/31/two-government-shutdowns-most-dramatic-effects-are-about-hit/) who rely on federal food stamps or send their children to government-funded health and education programs for low-income families. Money for both initiatives — the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, and Head Start — was supposed to go out Nov. 1. But the Trump administration says the shutdown means payments cannot be made. Two federal courts ruled Friday that officials must make at least partial payments, but the exact timing isn’t clear.

Without SNAP, federal worker Clarissa Browning isn’t sure what she’ll do. A Social Security claims specialist in Sacramento and an AFGE Local 3172 union representative, Browning said her disabled sister and daughter live with her and rely on food stamps. She was already scraping to pay for groceries. Her husband was recently laid off, and now her household will have no way to pay for food.

“It’s a double blow,” Browning said. “We’ve tapped out of everything we have.”

Of the nation’s 2.1 million federal workers, more than 750,000 have been furloughed — sent home without pay — for a full month. Hundreds of thousands more are working without a salary, even as President Donald Trump has found ways to pay some law enforcement agents and active-duty military personnel.

Adding to some workers’ anxiety, the administration is threatening to deprive furloughed staffers of back pay, even though Trump signed a 2019 law during his first term guaranteeing it after the last shutdown.

James Kirwan, 31, is among those who could be at risk. He has been furloughed from his job as a lawyer at the National Labor Relations Board since the shutdown began.

Facing mounting utility bills, food expenses, rent and $160,000 in student loans, Kirwan recently canceled a trip to Chicago for a close cousin’s wedding.

“I could probably go through another couple of weeks before I’m going to have to take on serious credit card debt. Serious loans,” he said.

Still, Kirwan said he feels lucky: Many federal workers are in far more precarious positions.

About one-sixth of the federal workforce in the executive branch makes less than the median national salary of about $62,000, according to a Washington Post analysis of available federal data.

The Federal Employee Education and Assistance Fund, a nonprofit that was offering $150 microgrants to federal workers since their first paychecks halted, said it was forced to stop accepting applications this week. The group had received more than 10,000 requests and was nearing its funding limit of $1 million, it said.

Most people who applied for grants were still working without pay, said Robyn Kehoe, the group’s executive director, and many were using the money for groceries. The average salary of those who got help was just over $50,000, Kehoe said.

“Like many of their fellow Americans, these workers live paycheck to paycheck, and they cannot keep up with their basic living needs right now,” Kehoe said.

One Social Security staffer in the Northeast noted that her family of five — three children and a spouse — is almost wholly reliant on her roughly $100,000 income. The staffer, like others interviewed for this article, spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution.

Her husband has a job, but it pays far less than her government position, she said: Her salary is what enabled the family to afford an apartment. As she keeps working without pay, she has begun using credit cards to pay her bills.

She is buying only the cheapest groceries: no meat, mostly frozen dinners and frozen pizza. Her family recently sat down for a dismal discussion, at which she informed the children that they wouldn’t be doing much of anything for Thanksgiving and that Christmas would bring exactly one gift per person.

This week, without her asking, a kind cousin sent her a check representing about a week’s worth of pay, she said. Until that arrived, she had no idea how she was going to pay her October rent.

“I don’t know what I will do next month,” she said, adding that, for the past few days, she has spent most of her nonworking hours sleeping or crying. “Usually, I am the kind of person who will have backup plans, and right now, there isn’t one. I am so scared.”

Our first date was on Thursday the 16th and it was amazing. We got on so well, kissed, held hands and both said we hadn’t had such a great first date in ages. We met again a few days later on the 19th, went to a museum, got coffee, held hands and just acted like a couple. In the space of two weeks we’ve met up five times, including sleeping together and me staying over at his on his birthday (the 22nd). That night felt really intimate.

The first time we had sex he said I was acting weird afterwards, and things were awkward for a few days. I apologised but nothing really changed. The following Sunday (26th) I met him again to pick up a top I’d left at his. I apologised again in person and he said I was hard to read but that he was glad I wanted to keep dating and that he still wanted to have fun. We ended up going back to his and sleeping together again.

After that, for a couple of days he was different, texting more, being flirty, and even letting me know when he’d be busy or slow to reply. Then on Thursday the 30th I went round again just to sleep with him (stupid, I know) and since then he hasn’t messaged me at all.

The sex is amazing, but the vibe changes so much afterwards. It probably doesn’t help that both times I’ve stayed over (the 22nd and 30th) I had to leave early in the morning. He sends me random reels on Instagram but doesn’t respond to my messages on WhatsApp, or he turns conversations sexual.
I really like him and don’t want to feel like I’ve messed it up by sleeping with him too soon. 

Please don’t shame me, I already feel bad enough. I just want to understand what’s going on here and whether this can still become something real or if I should walk away.

TL;DR: Met a guy three weeks ago and we hit it off instantly. Slept together early on and now he acts cold after sex, barely messages, and only sends Instagram reels. I really like him but feel like I ruined it by moving too fast.",10,1761994826.0,dating_advice,48,0.67,False

Enter the role of the **AI Auditor** — yes, it sounds fancy, but the job is delightfully simple. We don’t expect you to understand the intricacies of machine learning, neural networks, or whether a model is trained on the cloud or the back-office server. You run a business; you know your strengths. We bring the “make things work better” side of technology.

Here’s what an AI Auditor *actually* does for your business:

* **Spot the waste**: We review your workflows — the follow-ups that never happened, the messages unanswered, the data entered twice. Then we ask: “What if this were automatic?” Research shows AI can turn huge volumes of data into insights much faster than manual methods. [KPMG Assets](https://assets.kpmg.com/content/dam/kpmgsites/ch/pdf/audit-with-ai-en.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* **Free up your team**: When machines handle repetitive tasks, your staff gets to do the work that matters. Better strategy. Better service. Better growth. AI doesn’t replace people — it liberates them.
* **Translate tech into cash/time saved**: You don’t need to know “how” — you just need to know it *will*. Leading firms note that AI in audit workflows boosts efficiency and accuracy, and that kind of winning trickles down to everywhere. [wolterskluwer.com](https://www.wolterskluwer.com/en/expert-insights/artificial-intelligence-auditing-enhancing-audit-lifecycle?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* **Build for you now, grow for you later**: Whether you’re a local service business, an agency, or a coaching brand — the clean, efficient system we build becomes your foundation. No gimmicks. No hype. Just better operations.

If you’ve ever thought “there must be a smarter way to run this,” you were right. The smart way is here. Let’s build your systems like they’re built for the future — because they are.",0,1761994661.0,AiForSmallBusiness,0,0.5,False

I just launched my new Arcana Zodiac collection on Kickstarter: so far, I've finished modeling six heroines, and I'll be modeling the rest little by little so they can join the constellation.

✨ Each one is inspired by the signs of the zodiac, sculpted with lots of love, detail, and early morning coffee. ☕

I’m running a small pilot for a college project and need a bit of help.
All you’d have to do is share a short message (that I’ll give you) in your college WhatsApp group and send me a screenshot so I can confirm reach.
It’ll hardly take a minute, and I’ll be sending a small token of appreciation (like a coffee treat via UPI 😅).
If you’re a DU student, that’s perfect, but students from other universities can join too.

1olktlg,https://chat.whatsapp.com/Fmmz3Vlv0A6BdYTyXKtFpE?mode=wwt,Any cool dads here who want to walk n talk?,"
Hey everyone,

This is a personal post. I have been living in Munich for a while and recently became a dad. I keep noticing how there are endless mom groups and baby meetups everywhere. but almost nothing for dads.

Especially for the kind of dads who are forever young, creative, maybe a bit into fashion, tech or I don’t know, and just want peers to talk with. I see so many cool dads when I am out with the stroller. they look like they would be fun to talk to. but since we are in Germany we don’t speak to strangers unless there is a problem lol.

So I thought maybe we could change that a bit. The idea is simple. dads meet up somewhere for a coffee with their strollers. chat a bit. then go for a walk together. talk about life, tech, fashion, music, kids, work, sneakers, or whatever comes naturally. A small circle for dads who want to connect and just walk n talk together.

If you are in Munich or nearby and this sounds like something you would join. we are starting a small WhatsApp group called Cool Dads of Munich. 

let’s see if there are more of us out there. cool dads who just want to meet up, have a coffee, and walk n talk together.",2,1761994201.0,munichsocialclub,1,0.75,False
1olksm2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scrypted/comments/1olksm2/motion_detection_events_from_one_camera_never/,Motion detection events from one camera never each HomeKit,"Hello people

I fight this isssue since weeks!!!

I tried different way to run Scrypted (docker, HAOS, ...), 

created dozen of Google Device Access projects and associated Google Cloud projects.

From a set of 4 Google Nest cameras (doorbel, inside camera, outside camera and floodlight camera), the motion detection events from only one never reach Homekit, the floodlight camera.

Google is really a pain but the Google Nest plugin from Scrypted works pretty good, the floodlight camera logs motion detection events but the timeline on my Iphone stays empty.

90% of the other cameras events are listed in the respective camera frame which makes me wonder why only that one ? why just zero? it drive me nuts!

  
I would happily pay a coffee to anyone able to solve this!

  
thanks

My girlfriend told me a few days ago, after 6 years together, that she’s exhausted — with the relationship, with work, with feeling like she can’t breathe or find time for herself. She said she feels like she’s been carrying the relationship on her own for a while.

She also told me she feels like she has to spend all her free time with me because she thinks that’s what I want. Like she can’t take time for herself without making me upset.

She said I can be too controlling about small things (like hygiene or little habits), that I don’t communicate enough, that I’m too emotionally closed off. She feels like she has to talk for both of us. She also said I get angry too quickly and say hurtful things.

Sometimes when we argue, she goes to the bathroom to get away with our cat. Instead of letting her cool off, I follow her, begging her to come back and talk. I never gave her space, and I see now how suffocating that must have felt for her.

One fight still really haunts me. It was about something completely stupid. She walked away, and I lost my temper. I pushed her lightly against a wall and told her that if she wasn’t happy, she could just leave. I regret that moment deeply. It was only a few weeks ago.

We’ve been living together for a while and got engaged not too long ago. At that time, she wrote me beautiful things, saying it was the happiest day of her life and that she was afraid of losing me. Reading her old notes breaks my heart — she really loved me and feared losing me.

The night she told me she needed some time for herself, she still stayed. We held each other all night before she left in the morning.

Since then, I’ve done a lot of thinking. I’ve realized how much my anxiety, my need for control, and my temper hurt her. I started therapy to work on myself — to manage my anxiety, my emotional reactions, and to learn how to communicate better. I’m doing it for me, not just for her.

I told her that I understand what went wrong, that I believe things could be different — with better communication, more space, and me learning to handle my anxiety instead of letting it take over. She told me she still loves me and still cares about us, but that there’s just too much pain right now.

So I’m giving her space. We barely talk — just a few texts from me here and there. She turned down my offer to grab coffee this weekend, saying she’s already said everything she needed to say and that she needs some time.

I’m completely lost. Do I still have a chance that she’ll come back, or is this the end? How can I show her that I’m really changing if we hardly talk anymore?

Thanks to anyone who read all this. I just don’t know what to do anymore.

    **TL;DR;** : My 6 years GF told me she’s exhausted and needs space. She said she still loves me but can’t keep going because of how things have been. I’ve started therapy to work on my anxiety and communication, and I’m giving her time — but I don’t know if she’ll come back or if it’s already too late.

1olkpmc,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Himalayacoffee/comments/1olkpmc/why_nepalese_coffee_deserves_a_place_in_every/,Why Nepalese Coffee Deserves a Place in Every Espresso Machine,"Interest in Himalayan-grown coffee has grown steadily in recent years, as more people discover the smooth, distinctive flavors cultivated in Nepal’s mountainous regions. Known for its rich aroma, balanced taste, and sustainable farming, coffee from Nepal has quietly become a favorite among enthusiasts who appreciate both quality and ethical sourcing. 

Distinctive Flavor and Origin 

Coffee production in Nepal takes advantage of the country’s unique geography. The high-altitude farms, cool temperatures, and fertile soil of the Himalayan foothills create the perfect growing environment for Arabica beans. The slower ripening process at these elevations allows the beans to develop greater complexity and depth, resulting in a cup that is naturally sweet, full-bodied, and aromatic. This distinct profile sets Nepalese coffee apart from more common origins and appeals to those who value refined, nuanced flavors. 

Farmers in Nepal typically follow traditional and organic farming practices. Handpicking cherries at their peak ensures consistent quality, while natural sun-drying preserves the beans’ delicate notes. These methods not only yield exceptional flavor but also support sustainable agriculture and protect the surrounding ecosystem. 

Commitment to Sustainability 

Nepal’s coffee industry has grown with an emphasis on fairness and environmental responsibility. Many producers are smallholder farmers who form cooperatives, enabling them to maintain high standards while ensuring fair compensation for their work. This direct trade structure benefits both the farmers and the consumers, who can trace their coffee back to its source with confidence. 

The result is more than just a beverage — it’s a reflection of craftsmanship and care passed down through generations. Every cup tells the story of a community working together to preserve the integrity of its land and its harvest. 

Perfect Choice for Espresso Enthusiasts 

Those who enjoy a smooth, full-bodied espresso will find Nepalese beans to be an excellent choice. The balance of sweetness, low acidity, and natural depth allows for a rich cream and a satisfying finish that complements milk-based drinks as well. Many specialty roasters recommend [**Nepal Coffee Beans For Espresso Machines**](https://himalayacoffeecompany.com/why-top-rated-nepal-coffee-roasters-choose-premium-arabica-from-the-himalayas/) for their ability to produce consistent, flavorful results with every shot. 

The versatility of Nepalese coffee also makes it suitable for other brewing methods, such as pour-over or French press, without losing its signature smoothness. This adaptability has made it increasingly popular among both home brewers and professional baristas. 

Embracing Single-Origin Authenticity 

The growing global demand for traceable, single-origin coffee has further boosted Nepal’s presence in the specialty market. Consumers who appreciate transparency in sourcing and a unique sense of place are beginning to recognize the value of beans from the Himalayas. For those seeking to enjoy this authentic taste experience, a [**Single Origin Nepal Coffee Purchase**](https://himalayacoffeecompany.com/purchase-green-nepal-coffee-beans-online-from-himalayan-origins/) ensures direct access to premium-quality beans grown and processed at their origin. 

Buying single-origin coffee not only supports responsible production but also allows drinkers to explore subtle differences in flavor that reflect the terrain and microclimate of Nepal’s coffee-growing regions. 

Conclusion 

From its scenic mountain farms to its meticulous harvesting methods, Nepal’s approach to coffee cultivation embodies care, balance, and sustainability. The result is a beverage that satisfies both palate and conscience. 

For those eager to experience genuine Himalayan flavor, HCC – Himalaya Coffee Company offers a carefully curated selection of premium beans that bring the best of Nepal’s coffee heritage directly to your cup. ",1,1761993796.0,u_Himalayacoffee,0,1.0,False
1olkphm,https://i.redd.it/2y1qwuv4kmyf1.jpeg,Collection (1/2)(BNIB) Ranked and Reviewed and Need Suggestions for next buy.,"Hello there, fellow smelly water enthusiasts!
It’s been over two years since I started collecting fragrances and became a fragrance enthusiast.
Before, I was only buying decants, but for over a month now, I’ve been buying BNIBs (Brand New in Box).

Note 1: I bought decants for all of them before purchasing full bottles, except for Supremacy Collector’s Edition and Daarej.
Note 2: Ratings are based solely on my own experience and are not meant to offend anyone.
Note 3: The top three are masterpieces!

So, here’s my collection - Ranked and Reviewed!


S-Tier

• Afnan Supremacy Collector’s Edition
An amazing and rich, all-weather beast-mode fragrance that lasts a very long time. It opens with a wonderful fruity note mixed with woodiness and ambery goodness. The drydown keeps that woody, ambery richness with musk and oakmoss, truly a perfect, versatile, and mass-appealing fragrance. (Got 3 compliments on the very first day!)
It’s a masterpiece right out of the box, no maceration needed! I can only imagine how much better it might get after maceration.
(11/10)

• Azzaro The Most Wanted Intense EDP
I first smelled this at an airport and instantly fell in love. I don’t care if people call it an SWY clone but I think it’s even better. Perfect for parties, concerts, and date nights. The opening is sweet, spicy, and woody, while the drydown gives ambery, woody goodness. A truly beast-mode, long-lasting fragrance.
(10/10)



A-Tier

• Lattafa Bade’e Al Oud Honor & Glory
A gourmand DNA done right! It’s beast-mode and long-lasting in almost all weathers except very hot summers. The opening is creamy pineapple, sweet vanilla, and a touch of spice. The drydown is vanilla, woody, and slightly powdery and smells delicious!
Half a point is deducted because right after spraying, the pineapple note can smell a bit synthetic, though it disappears after 15–20 minutes. That’s the only reason it’s not in S-Tier. Nonetheless, it’s a masterpiece.
(9.5/10)

• Bentley for Men Intense
My favorite boozy and woody fragrance. The opening is spicy and boozy with strong woodiness. The drydown reveals incense, leather, and woody richness. A mature and classy scent, though not suitable for every occasion and best for colder weather.
(9/10)

• Armaf Club de Nuit Intense Man Pure Parfum
An excellent take on the classic Aventus DNA that we all know and love. Beast-mode performance, long-lasting, and perfect for everyday summer wear. The opening bursts with strong citrus and a hint of fruitiness, leading into a drydown with lingering fruit, smooth woods, and musk. -2 points because it can feel a bit synthetic without maceration.
(8/10)

• Lattafa Khamrah Qahwa
An amazing, very blind-buy-safe winter fragrance for all genders. It’s the most beast-mode and long-lasting fragrance I own, over 12 hours on skin and nearly eternal on clothing! The opening is sweet and gourmand, with hints of cinnamon, cardamom, and ginger. The drydown brings out vanilla, coffee, musk, and white florals. The only drawback is that the vanilla-gourmand sweetness can sometimes feel overpowering, which is why it’s lower in the rankings. Still, a fantastic fragrance.
(7.5/10)



B-Tier

• Rasasi Daarej pour Homme
My first proper perfume and a complete blind buy this is what got me into fragrances, and it will always hold a special place in my heart. That said, after smelling and owning over 100 fragrances (full bottles, partials, decants, samples, etc.), I’d say it’s a bit mid. The opening is spicy with a touch of rose, and the drydown features vanilla and a bit of woodiness. Great for winter or special occasions if you’re on a budget.
(6/10)


Conclusion:
That wraps up my review! I’d really appreciate it if you could suggest my next two fragrances (middle eastern or cheapies) to complete my collection for now.

1olkne6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1olkne6,"DN1 Delicatessen and Dining (Doncaster, UK)","This place had been on my list for a while, as I used to live in Doncaster and visit fairly often for work and friends

Based in the centre, under a Premier Inn hotel, seems a strange location for a fine dining restaurant. However, the set up inside is nicely done and makes you forget where you are. 

A deli during the day, restaurant at night, set up by one of the local fishmongers originally, so seafood heavy menu

The dishes

1. Braised beef tongue, panko breadcrumbs, burger sauce and pickles
Nice but lacking a bit of seasoning in the tongue to make it stand out

2. Salmon sushi roll, wasabi cream, tempura fried with wasabi caviar
Slightly warm, nice heat from the two types of wasabi

3. Set mackerel custard, charred mackerel, chilli crisp oil, seaweed essence
Nice mackerel flavour, if a little under seasoned. Chilli crisp added a nice texture and lingering spice. Seaweed essence went missing

4. Chinese sausage jam, cured prawn, prawn head sauce, chive oil
Sausage jam was the star, added nice spice and sweetness. Despite the curing, prawn didn't add much. Nice flavour from the sauce

5. Homemade crumpets, cheese custard (cheddar and parmesan), smoked caviar
Lovely custard, great cheese flavour. Crumpets lighter than they looked, caviar added a hint of luxury and added seasoning

6. Scallop, carrot puree, pickled raisins, ginger foam, dukkah
Nicely cooked scallop, added sweetness from the puree. Ginger and dukkah added a nice spice. Best course so far

7. Potato hash brown, oyster mushrooms and treacle and tamarind sauce
Hash brown was light and crispy, soaked up the sauce well. Mushrooms were ok but didn't add much. Sauce packed a punch, nice spice level

8. Duck breast, whipped duck liver on brioche, Madeira reduction, Madeira sauce
Rich duck, offset by sweet Madeira sauce, duck liver and brioche was a nice light addition

9. Dehydrated croissant, coffee ice cream, frangipane, croissant foam 
Rich, buttery foam with great croissant flavour. Sweetness from frangipane, nice coffee flavour. Lovely dish

10. Pumpkin parfait, roasted compressed pumpkin, pumpkin cake, pumpkin caramel
Roasted pumpkin tasted a bit flat, nothing really to it. Caramel added a nice sweetness, cake was soft tender and nicely spiced. Good spicing in the parfait 

Overall, a nice experience but maybe lacking a touch of seasoning and refinement to get to the next level. I'll go back, but maybe not rush to go back

Here’s How!

Okay… so, tell me if this sounds familiar — you set a goal, feel that rush of excitement, make a few big moves… and then, somewhere in the middle… *poof* the energy fades. Suddenly your perfectly mapped-out plan begins to wobble under real life’s chaos. You’re not alone — like, seriously, we’ve *all* been there. 😅

But what if the real problem isn’t the goal itself… but all the little obstacles hiding inside our habits?

Let’s dig in. 👇

---

**Common Obstacles to Goal Achievement**  
- **Unclear priorities:** You want *everything* at once — fitness, business, travel, mental peace—but your focus scatters faster than confetti.  
- **Fear of failure:** Sometimes, we stall not because we can’t, but because we’re scared to *really* try.  
- **No plan, just vibes:** Motivation without structure burns out fast.  
- **Time leaks:** You ever wonder where your hours vanish? (They hide in social scrolling and “just one episode.”)

---

**How to Start Overcoming Them**  
Here’s the confusing yet comforting truth: progress doesn’t feel like progress. It often feels… messy, slow, and doubtful.  

But here’s what helps:  
- **Break big goals into micro-steps.** The smaller the step, the easier the win.  
- **Use habit stacking.** Anchor new habits to existing ones — morning coffee = five lines of journaling, boom!  
- **Kill perfectionism.** “Done” will always beat “perfect someday.”  
- **Build an accountability system.** Friends. Online groups. Even sticky notes on your fridge.

---

**Developing Motivation that Stays Lit 🔥**  
You can’t rely on motivation alone; it’s like a crush — intense but fleeting. What lasts is discipline wrapped in clarity.  
- Reset your “why.” Why *this* goal matters should hit you straight in the heart.  
- Celebrate micro-victories. Every 1% improvement counts.  
- Track progress visually — checklists, boards, or trackers that spark a dopamine buzz.  

---

**Prioritize & Manage Time Smartly**  
This one always gets tricky for me. Sometimes I don’t even know what “urgent” means anymore. So here’s what cleared things up:  
- Do a *weekly clarity dump* — throw all your to-dos on paper. Then ask: *What really moves the needle?*  
- Apply the **80/20 rule.** Twenty percent of your effort brings eighty percent of your results.  
- Time-block your calendar because free-floating days = distraction city.

---

**The Plan to Make Dreams Real ✨**  
Dreams aren’t meant to float forever. Tie them down with action.  
- Convert visions into measurable tasks with deadlines.  
- Check progress regularly — every Sunday or at the end of each mini-phase.  
- Revise as you go. Plans that breathe grow stronger.

---

**Building Confidence & Success Mindset**  
This one hits deep. You don’t “find” confidence; you *create* it by doing what scares you until it doesn’t anymore.  
Remind yourself: confidence is a memory of action. The more you act, the more proof you collect that you *can* figure things out.  
Replace “I hope I can” with “I’m learning how.” Tiny phrasing tweak, huge mental shift.

---

So maybe the magic of goal setting isn’t really about giant steps. It’s about steady ones, consistent ones — the ones that remind you that progress lives in persistence, not perfection. 🌱

If you’re on this journey too, what’s *your* biggest challenge? Is it focus? Fear? The daily energy dips? Drop your thoughts below — maybe we’ll all walk a bit straighter through the chaos, together. 💭",1,1761992678.0,pinteresttrends,0,1.0,False

Few months back in June I got COVID for the third time; I was afraid I am going to die as after my 2nd I was told to avoid 3rd at all cost or it could be fatal for me which it nearly was; this time it led to type 1 respiratory failure. That experience changed my life.

My doctor was very clear: protect your lungs, mask consistently. Not “every now and then,” not “only in hospitals,” but as an ongoing thing. So now I wear a proper respirator / N95-level mask consistently even inside spaces because I know what happens if I don’t.

People assume I’m overreacting. Some think I’m sick. Some ridicule me and others think i am young so i am not possibly that ill. What almost no one understands is: I’ve already had 3 infections and the last one literally messed up my breathing — I do not get to be casual about this anymore.

I still want to do normal things. I want to grab coffee (outdoors), talk, study, exist around people without having to explain my entire medical history first. I’m just trying to stay healthy enough to keep studying and working here.

So… I’m posting because I’m looking for friends. People who don’t make it weird that I keep my mask on. People who understand that clean air and masking are just preventive health, not a personality. People who won’t tell me “just this once.”

If you’re in Melbourne or even if you are not and still masking / high-caution / COVID-careful, or you’ve also had a bad outcome from an infection and now you’re long-term cautious, I’d love to connect, even on Reddit. Please let’s be friends. 

Thanks for reading. This sub is one of the few places that makes me feel like I’m not imagining the risk.
