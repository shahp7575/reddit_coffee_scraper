Here's what helped me!,"https://preview.redd.it/tt0gv57od9le1.jpg?width=4241&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=40d4d632150b3d605848b51cbedc8b951052e980

So, I work on a fully remote team spread across three continents. And let me tell you—time zone differences can be brutal. One person is having their morning coffee, another is barely keeping their eyes open at midnight, and someone else just woke up to 100+ Slack messages. Sound familiar?

# The Struggle Is Real

* **Burnout is inevitable** if you're constantly adjusting your sleep just to accommodate meetings.
* **Asynchronous work saves lives**—trust me, Slack messages and Loom videos are your best friends.
* **Scheduling across continents is a nightmare**—why does every ""available time slot"" still screw someone over?
* **Feeling isolated is common** when you're working while the rest of the team is asleep.

# What Actually Works?

* **Set core hours** where at least 4 hours overlap for everyone.
* **Rotate meeting times** so the same people aren’t always sacrificing their sleep.
* **Document everything** so nobody feels out of the loop.
* **Encourage casual interactions**—small talk matters when you don’t get daily office chats.
* **Make leadership aware** that bias exists—people in ""off"" time zones shouldn’t miss out on opportunities.

GitLab does this best: everything is documented, every meeting recorded, and no one is forced into 2 AM calls. If you’re struggling, **bring these ideas up with your team.** Remote work is supposed to be flexible, not a time zone prison.

How do you handle time zone differences? Let’s vent and share solutions!

1ixri7t,https://www.reddit.com/r/rpghorrorstories/comments/1ixri7t/lunatic_dnd_player_puts_meth_in_my_coffee/,Lunatic DnD Player Puts Meth in My Coffee,"Oh boy this is a wild memory to this day. I still refuse to drink coffee because of this incident.



So I play with a group of friends who go to the same college as me. And I have been playing with them for at least two years now (albeit with some players coming and going). We recently started up a new game though and our party’s rogue decided to take up DMing for a change.



He was a pretty good DM to be fair. He didn’t prepare but man was he a master at improv. We the party built all of our characters and we generally tended to gravitate towards the typical archetypes we usually play as. We had our hippie healer, our horny bards (or horny warlock occasionally), our borderline murderhobo, and me—a lawful good “voice of reason” paladin. 



While I appreciate edgy characters, I usually like playing the opposite and the party loved to bust my balls about it. They’d tell me to take the stick out of my ass and lighten up and all that good stuff. It was all in good fun—or so I thought.



One day, we were playing at borderline murderhobo’s house and we had just finished a major battle with a powerful Goblin Samurai and so we headed back to the City. It may not sound like it, but this was a massive accomplishment for us. That Goblin Samurai was our nemesis for the last 5 or so sessions now. were euphoric. Borderline Murderhobo mentioned how he was gonna find this Priest and kill him for converting his girlfriend and making her swear an oath to a life of religious celibacy. The rest of the party was on board. The sentiment was basically “Fuck it, we all deserve one random act of murder + loot”. Plus the temple was loaded. My character was obviously opposed to this idea and threatened to tell the authorities. 



Borderline Murderhobo groaned and said “No worries” with an evil grin. I smirk, thinking he is planning something in game that I was gonna have to thwart. He then abruptly said. Let's have a break. I want some coffee—y’all want some? We all agreed. He gave us our coffee as we talked a bit and then got back to our game. As we went to the city, I started feeling real jittery and wild and the feeling just escalated. It was unlike any other feeling I could imagine. And I felt impulsive. So when the party inevitably did kill the priest, I also joined in. And then I started cheering super loud and then I remembered saying “Fuck it, I’m killing every mother fucker in here!” DM just laughed and said “You know you’re gonna become an oathbreaker paladin after this right?” I said “Fuck my oaths! Its time to turn this temple red!” And we slaughtered everyone in the temple. Including the children. And afterwards, we were greeted by city watchmen and city templars (paladins) who tried to stop us as we escaped.



As we were on the road, discussing means to change our identities as wanted men (and women), I was in real life feeling worse and worse as my heart was pounding like never before and I was paranoid both about getting attacked in DnD and paranoid about dying irl from some heart attack. I started theorizing that maybe my coffee was too strong and I even asked borderline (not so borderline) murderhobo’s player how much coffee he put in. He said “Just the right amount” as he could barely hold off laughter which freaked me out. I kept pressing until he admitted he added “a little something extra”. I asked him if it was weed and he just laughed his ass off. DM then asked him “Ok dude what the hell did you do to our coffee. This isn’t funny.” And he just kept laughing and said “Its just (paladin’s) coffee! He’s tweaking!” We ALL let out a collective “WHAT!?!?” as he just kept laughing. 



I then start freaking out more as the DM and party try to calm me down as I am now flailing in my seat and start crying. I think the crying got to borderline murderhobo’s player cause he did stop laughing after that and tried to tell me its ok and that he only put a little bit in there. Horny bard’s player asks “How much is a ‘little bit’ huh?” He said “Just like 50 mg tops” DM then said “50mg! You fucking asshole! Go! Get out! Go somewhere!!” He then said “This is my house” but DM just stared him down and he left. The next few hours were a nightmare of paranoia and shame but they stayed there with me until my friend got me to go to sleep (lol) after I drank a boatload of calming tea and got me some calming music. Still didn’t get to sleep for a WHILE but eventually I did. The next morning DM was still there and he offered to take me to get some food. I guess borderline murderhobo stayed at a hotel but he came back the next morning profusely apologetic before I left. I didn’t want to speak to him and I haven’t since and the DnD game is on pause.



At this point though I have put some distance between me and the incident and while I’m definitely not at “look back and laugh at this” yet, I do wonder if I am willing to forgive him given the fact that he does seem sincerely apologetic and I kinda just want my life back to normal. But I don’t know. I need at LEAST another month before even considering it and DM to his credit put the game on delay for more or less around that long.

He hasn’t really said anything directly flirty I don’t think, but he sort of hinted that we should go for beer together instead of coffee like we normally do, and he asked for my number so we wouldn’t be messaging on Teams (he claimed it’s totally normal just as pals and not flirtatious when I got worried later about us getting in trouble for saying that on Teams) and he said stuff like ‘I wanted to invite you back to cheer me up (after he had a bad day)’ bc he lives really close to work, but everything he’s said seems sort of like it could be seen as platonic if you tried, nothing super direct? 

He’s brought up the age gap twice though but then kept sort of flirting afterwards which is confusing me. Like I said he should’ve invited me back bc I was free anyway and he said he didn’t want to be inappropriate ‘you’re also 18 which I feel weird about 😅’ and later I said babe in a text (I’ve called him that irl too I call everyone that, he’s brought it up before) and he said ‘calling me babe feels wrong you’re 18 stop scaring me’.

1ixrgn5,https://www.reddit.com/r/DesignMyRoom/comments/1ixrgn5/advice_on_dining_table_size_style_for_small_space/,Advice on Dining Table Size & Style for Small Space,"Hi everyone,

I could really use some help figuring out what size dining table I can afford space-wise and whether there’s a particular shape or style that would work best for my small living room. So far, the only furniture I’ve purchased are:

* **Couch:** 86” x 38”
* **Coffee table:** 52” x 31”
* **Media console:** 66” x 18”

I’m also planning to buy a smaller **PC desk** (48” x 30”), which I’ve staged next to the kitchen counter.

Given these pieces, what are my options for a dining table? I visited a furniture store, and the salesperson mentioned that a **36” round table with 2-3 chairs** or a **bistro table with two chairs** are my only real options. Do you think that’s accurate?

In the attached pictures, the smaller yellow measuring tapes were set to 120 inches, and the larger one was set to 36 inches for reference.

Lastly, any suggestions on what color table and chairs would complement the furniture I already have?

Thanks in advance for your help!

Reason: Nvidia’s forward PE model is build SOLE on chip spending by U.S. tech giants. Their customer base is actually not that diversified in AI, seeing majority of small players can’t afford to buy their products and their otherwise large client - Chinese firms are banned by law and sanctioned again for evading sanctions. 

So, if Msft, Google, Amazon see the economy turning and people not willing to pay some ridiculous 200$ monthly for GPT pro and would rather buy coffee and eggs instead, won’t they simply walk back on their capex expansion plans and cut spending? Seems canceling spending plans is already happening and if they cancel the lease on the data center - automatically means cut orders on chips for the data center. Means Nvidia future income just reduced and should be a short not matter which way around you look at it.

I'm sharing a demo of what you can now do with MCP Server I built:

1. Ask Cursor to build a database for you and it will *not only* write the SQL queries but also create schemas, tables, RLS, edge functions, triggers, views for you
2. Manage your Supabase project end to end via [management API integration](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/api/introduction) \- update db config, auth config, edge functions setup - anything that is supported
3. Ask Cursor to switch between `safe` and `unsafe` modes for query execution and management API so that it doesn't f\*ck your db -- at least without you knowing about it

Check out the vid attached - in 5 minutes it built me a full database for an e-commerce platform with:  
\- 1  database schema  
\- 6 relational tables (users, products, categories, orders, etc.)  
\- 18 RLS policies  
\- 8 edge functions including search and recommendations  
\- 10 automated triggers for inventory and order management  
\- 1 analytics view

Also, since v0.46 Cursor's MCP integration is much more reliable and easier to connect to.

You can find the installation guide in the repo:

1ixrdid,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ixrdid/i_25f_am_my_partners_33m_family_scapegoat_how_do/,I (25F) am my partners (33M) family scapegoat. How do I address this in couples therapy?,"TLDR; partner's aunties bullied me for years, partner never protected me, finally i had my last straw when they bullied my grieving family. I am now the family scapegoat, and now my partner is blaming me for his entire family's downfall. How do I address my partners toxic family in couples therapy?

Something I never thought would happen in my life has happened as an in-law. i've become a scapegoat. 

it all started 4 years ago when my partner's cousins girlfriend and I had a falling out. we mutually agreed to give each other space, move on and not involve anyone. Later, she began spreading rumours about me to my partner's family. these rumours caught like wildfire, spreading across his huge intertwined family and eventually got back to me and partner (we were the last to find out). by the time we found out, majority of his family had deleted me on everything. 

as badly as i wanted to clear my name, i hoped that the truth would rise and people would eventually see my true character. Also, my partner took the lead. the ""high road"" of ignoring them until someone asks. nobody really asked. it was a slow, silent cut-off and the only real noise was the floating rumours about me to family, friends and community. 

my partner and his cousin stopped being close.
my partner's mom/dad and his aunty/uncle all stopped talking.
aunties (he has 4 specifically) let me know through words and actions that they despised me every chance they got. 

for 3.5 years, i dealt with a lot of bullying...
- Aunties glaring at me and looking at me like Im dirt in public at events (I can count 10+ times) 
- The cousin's mom (my partners Aunty J) gave me the dirtiest look with an eye roll, then whispered over to another Aunty B. This made me break down crying to my mother in law because the bullying felt wrong. 
- Continuous rumours being spread about my character- to the point where it got to my potential practicum supervisor at the local school which inhibited me from doing my practicum there (small community)
- I had one aunty continuously humiliate me by ignoring me when i spoke to her. I would say ""Hi ___, how are you"" and she wouldn't even look at me. I kept doing this (5 times) and even my partner noticed her ignoring me, it was humiliating. This continued until this year when I was working at a community event in the kitchen with her, I addressed her by her name and asked a question and she wouldn't look at me or speak to me. It was awkward, so her daughter answered the question for her. 
- Aunty ""M"" in particular spoke to me when i was pregnant and told his family (in front of me) that she believes the rumours and alluded to my ""drama"" ripping apart the family. Later on, she sat beside me and talked for a while, then she told me she thought I was the cousin's girlfriend this entire conversation and I looked just like her and then she laughed obnoxiously in my face. (Note: This is my second time ever meeting Aunty M) 
- I borrowed a coffee cup from Aunty M's daughter this same day, and for the entire day, every single time she saw me, she reminded me to give back that cup. (4 times). As if I was going to steal a cup.

I told my partner about every single glare, humiliation, rumour, word spoken to me (or not spoken). Throughout the 3.5 years, my partner never told his aunties that they're not allowed to treat me this way. He never sat down with his cousin and his aunty/uncle and told them the truth and debunked rumours. He never made a public statement on their family Facebook group page (his entire family is active in) to clear up my name or address the bullying I've endured. I became very depressed, anxious, and felt unwelcome in this community. The bullying from his aunties alone drove me to the point of leaving my relationship a few times. 

This is when I finally had enough... June 2024.

-  we're at a community event and Aunty M is there. This is my 3rd time meeting her. 1.5 months before this event I lost my mother suddenly and was grieving hard. My grieving family (little sister, little brother, and aunty S) drove 9 hours to come to this event. It was my first time seeing them since the funeral. 
- Aunty M stood behind their seats and said some things that made them feel unwelcome and uncomfortable, she even shook one of the seats my sister was sitting on to get them to move. 
- When this was happening, I told my partner to do something. He wouldn't. He told me to just wait for his mom to come and handle it. 
- Aunty M continued to say things to make my family uncomfortable, I urged my partner to please do something, he still refused. My own aunty S told me they were moving seats because ""apparently we're not allowed to sit here"" 
- I looked to my partner one last time, telling him Aunty M just kicked my family out of their seats, and he still did nothing and told me to wait for his Mom. . 

By this point, I was so tired of the bullying. I endured at least 20 instances of bullying from his family, expecting to keep quiet and this whole time my partner has never stood up for me.  I went up to Aunty M and told her very sternly that she has no right to kick my family out of their seats.

She messaged me nasty things, including that she should've punched me in the face when I was speaking to her. She told me that I am the reason her family is broken apart (because of this stupid rumour spread by the cousins girlfriend years prior). I never responded.

Aunty M told my partner not to marry me.

I realized how much this action hurt my partner. I apologized to him instantly, even though I was extremely frustrated that he never sticks up for me. We set up a healing circle (run by his aunties, of course) and I apologized to Aunty M for speaking to her that way. Aunty M took no accountability. Instead, during the ""healing circle"", she...
- mocked my dead mom.. she said: ""I saw a woman with grey hair sitting near my seat (referring to my aunty S) and thought that must be ____'s Mom. But then I remembered, oh right! Her mom is dead."" nobody stood up for me or told her that was unnecessary 
- She said my sister, brother, and aunty are all delusional and hearing voices
- She literally said ""I take no accountability. I did nothing wrong. I said nothing."" and the family accepted this. 
- She took no accountability for anything. It was only me who apologized 

The hate from his family got worse. More deleting, more rumours. My partner finally made a long post on the family FB group. However, it was only about how this has affected his mental health. When addressing me, my truth in all of this- from debunking the initial ""rumour"" and debunking Aunty M's lies. for all the years I've been bullied, all he said about me was: ""Mistakes were made, but I know that forgiveness will never be given."" 

I later told him I felt incredibly betrayed because he posted this without my knowledge, without asking me, and was disappointed by his lack of protection on my name. 

My partner called our wedding off 4 months ago.

Now, every time my partner and I have a small disagreement, he tells me that I'm the reason his family is broken apart and why he has nobody. When I defend myself and try to tell him that I was bullied for years and remind him that Aunty M mocked my dead mother, and he never once defended me, then he will shut down and deflect and ultimately blame me for everything. He tells me that he's unhappy with me. 

I have never tried to ruin this family. For years I showed up with a smile on my face and remained kind and unproblematic. I always thought that one day, his family would treat me good. They would see the real me. To be blamed for this family breaking up, to be blamed for my partners family wanting nothing to do with him- that is painting me as an individual that I do not recognize. That is not who I am, that is not what I did. It makes me extremely frustrated that he thinks this.

So, I have a few thoughts... 
- I am experiencing a heartbreak I have never felt in my entire life
- I am my in-laws family scapegoat
- I was bullied to my limits from his family, I never did anything until they bullied my grieving family and my partner refused to stop it
- His aunties will never take accountability. It is easier to blame me than to admit that they're toxic.
- The gaslighting from his family is so powerful, it has taken over my partners mind and even my own.

I'm writing this down and starting to recount events in detail because I'm afraid that I am actually going crazy. I have been blamed entirely for this when I know it cannot possibly be all of my fault.

We are starting couples therapy this month, but every time I get close to talking about this topic, i feel like I am going to puke and pass out.

Idk. Maybe this will turn into a message into the void. I'm afraid that if my partner never sees the way his family is toxic, enmeshed, and lacks boundaries and respect, then I think I will have no choice but to become a single mom of 2. 

I love my partner deeply but this has broken my mind. 

edit: 

Cousin and Aunty J have a history of ""silently cutting off"" my partner when he was only 15, over a rumour the cousin spread. 

Aunty M has attacked an outsider/in-law like me in the past. She attacked my partner's older cousin (son of the Aunty who ignores me when i speak to her) She brought up his cousin's partners previous DUI that resulted in her relative passing away, and suggested this woman not be married into the family. The cousin completely cut Aunty M off and married his wife. 

This entire family in general, all of the aunties, have a history of inserting themselves in their family's relationships and bullying in-laws. ",1,1740476988.0,relationship_advice,3,1.0,False

If this was my first cruise, I would never get on another one.","Our group of 3 hated our time on the ship from start to finish, beginning with boarding. Boarding day we do early bag drop and are told we can early board until 1. We say great and head off for breakfast in the town we are in, returning to board around 11:50. We are told that early boarding closed at 12 and we can’t get on. It’s not yet 12 but that doesn’t actually mean anything and are told there is no more boarding. We’re stuck in town for another 6hrs, not a big issue except you couldn’t book cabanas or ticketed events until on ship, so no dice on some things we were interested in once finally on. We get on the boat and I will say that it is a nice boat. It is the newest and cleanest cruise ship I have been on; we were excited for the week. The room was the most expensive but smallest one we have had on a ship. 


We have two people with gluten allergies (celiacs). The options were the most limited of any ship we have been on and they somehow made many naturally gluten free food items contain gluten, like steak, salt baked fish, bernaise sauce, and macaroons. We also were served inconsistent restaurant items marked as GF. My husband ordered the same dishes at the same restaurant twice. These items were marked as GF on the menu but served to him differently on the two different nights. One night the asparagus was served with a sauce and cheese on top and the next it was plain. The salsa verde was marked GF and then were told that it wasn’t GF that night. Items at other restaurants were not marked GF but then we were served them and told they were GF. It made dining confusing and stressful. In the food court area, not all the dining stations stayed open during the day. So we could get an omelette at 4pm but not tacos. This complaint sounds asinine, but Mexican food is one of the easiest options for my GF husband to get a filling meal. On day 2 at sea we planned on getting to taco station before it closed for lunch (gf lunch options were almost always the same and limited), they were serving gyros instead. 

One member of our party has a medical device that requires bottled water. We didn’t realize there would be no bottled water available on board, but luckily had 2 from our hotel on hand for the first nights. I totally get and support sustainability efforts, but it seemed disingenuous when sodas were being poured out of cans and espresso was being made into single use paper cups that were tossed out for each beverage vs using a reusable glass like a normal coffee shop would. 


We were out by pool by 9am on both sea days and were greeted by all seats covered in guest items with no guests around for them to belong to. They sent a message out about not saving chairs but did not actually enforce it. 


There was a lack of ship activities on sea days, especially day 2. Most of the ship activities were gym classes (usually booked out), cost an extra fee, were health seminars (where something is usually sold to you). 


Our room lock stopped working and we were locked out of room for about 45minutes while they tried to fix it. 


Service in general was the worst we have experienced, the exception being our room attendant. He was delightful. The server in the Sip Social seemed to actively avoid taking orders and never brought one that we placed. One of our party was charged for drinks that were ordered by someone not in our group while we were all on shore. At one point, my husband’s wristband rang him up as Steve. He is not named Steve. 


Information in general felt lacking. I don’t need the intercom in my room but the app was constantly having issues for us. They never notified you when you could get off boat, we just happened to walk down early each day and notice the doors were open. Spaces felt hard to locate for anything you wanted to do. 


The main show room was small and people started lining up 40min ahead of showtime. Multiple shows were canceled and instead of saying they were canceled and substituted, you were surprised by the substitute show. The substitution was the same act each time and one we were choosing to not go to when it was at its regularly scheduled time. A lot of the performances overlapped and we were unable to make most that we wanted to see because this or what was available for dinner slots. One of these nights we chose show B over A that had overlapping show times but different start times. We found out when it was too late that show B was substituted. 


Last night on ship had two shows I had been hoping to see and we finally had an early dinner slot, so we could actually make the early show and the late show. Dinner ended up taking over two hours and we missed the early show, so had to make the A vs B choice for the late slot since the first show repeated but overlapped the other option. We chose B, had the performance ruined by guests speaking through the last 15-20min of the show (we could not hear the performance they were so loud) and then one guest from that group attempted to assault us. No crew member intervention occurred during the show or during the altercation, other guests came to our aide. We asked a crew member for help locating security and he did not know this information or seemingly what security was. The person who attacked us was allowed to keep enjoying the night. 


This was the 4th cruise line I have been on and is by far the bottom of the list. I feel like a brat typing this out, but this trip cost $$$ and it felt like a waste of vacation days.

1ixr5kz,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ixr5kz/aita_for_doing_this/,AITA for doing this?,"Warning! Long text. A story about my relationships. Advice is really needed.

Me (27F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been together for almost 10 years. I decided to break up with him because he was very abusive and I was honestly scared of him. I would get breathing issues (hyperventilation) when I was around him. In general I didn’t feel safe in that relationship. I still loved him very much or I thought I might be trauma bounded with him after some research, and that’s why I couldn’t leave the relationship for so long, especially that we lived in a different country, and I was codependent on him with many things. 

I finally, made my decision to leave the relationship, and move back to my homeland. It was honestly the hardest decision that I have ever made, especially, to leave someone I was so deeply in love. 

I sold and donated majority of my stuff since I liked the minimalistic lifestyle. So I was left with my luggage and other stuff that I left at our home. 

I remember the last days before leaving him. I was absolutely emotionally numb, so I was able to stay cold and follow my plan. I left.

I moved back to my parents, and I thought that my life was over. I didn’t think I could ever recover from this. 

I couldn’t move on, so I saved some money, and booked an ayahuasca retreat. My main goal was to let go of the love I had for him. 

My sessions were difficult. During the second session I was still saying that nothing helps, and I still loved him very much, and was almost shouting inside. In that moment I became his mum (under the psychedelic affect), and could see her point of view, and how much love she has for her children. This way I was able to express all the love that I had, and left it there. I was able to let it go. It still took me time to integrate but it definitely helped me a lot to move on. 

Months go by and my life starts to get better, and I start to get glimpses of not being depressed. I honestly never thought it is possible to feel this way. It could also be an effect of me starting to drink coffee from time to time. What’s important that I slowly started to get excited about my life and my future.

Me and my best friend decided to travel around Europe, and while travelling I’ve met this guy. We’ve spend like three days together, and I liked him but I knew he was a walking red flag. Yet I still fell for him. During the trip he kissed me, and after that I told him that we can’t talk ever again (it’s probably due to my avoidant attachment style).

But we still spent some time together the next day. I was definitely attracted to him, and he was doing everything to have ‘something’ with me but I stopped him, and told him that I still would feel like I would be cheating, so nothing else happened between us. We still kept chatting after the trip since we were both living in different countries, and he wanted to come to my country to meet me but I rejected this offer because I knew he was a red flag and just wanted to sleep with me. I wanted to meet him but I was afraid to get attached to him. 

He started breadcrumbing me while chatting, and it was really addictive to me. I knew it wasn’t healthy but I couldn’t stop thinking about him. Every time he would text me I would get extreamly excited, and wanted to respond immediately but I was trying to wait bc he was doing that. Breadcrumbs are very addictive. Those who tried to move on from such situationship/relationship knows how hard it can be. I’ve read some posts on Reddit from people who went through this, and some people get stuck in this situation for years.

At this point I feel like I fully moved on from the previous relationship, and now am stuck in this situationship. My ex boyfriend decided to break no contact, and contacted me. He told me that he regrets the way he treated me, and can’t forgive himself for losing me. It’s because he found my diary, and realised how much I loved him.

He seemed to be in a lot of pain, and I didn’t want him to be. He wanted to see me, and at first I rejected that, and said that it’s not a good idea but he was at such a low point that I agreed to meet. We drank some tea and spoke about how life was going for us. He seemed to be better in the middle of the break up but now he was surprised to see me getting better because when he was ok I was still completely broken.

I told him about my ayahuasca experience and about my trip around Europe. He then told me that he slept with two women, and I was quite surprised but didn’t really have feelings for him, so I was kind of ok but was just really surprised because I used to be his first and only one. 

He seemed to be really sad, you could see that he was hurting, so we hugged and cuddled a little. I wanted him to feel better. Yet I already had feelings for another person. 

After that, he started texting me more often as he was really hoping to get me back. I was replying to him, and we were talking. He clearly wanted to get me back but I told him that I don’t think that we are compatible (what he used to say), and that I wouldn’t be ready for a relationship again because I already had feelings for someone else.

I said that we should go no contact again, and he agreed. Even though, he was at an extremely low point. We stopped chatting again but after some time (maybe a week later) he still texted me saying that he will never forgive him for letting me go. He also said, that already for some time he was having horrible nightmares related to being alone, and remembering me. After he would wake up he would realise that I’m not next to him and that he was in a horrible emotional pain. He could even barely sleep. 

I felt really bad for that, I couldn’t see him in such pain, so I started chatting again. He said he would do everything to get back together, even if it would take long time for my feelings to return. I didn’t want to go back to this relationship but I couldn’t leave him in such pain.

We continued chatting, and I told him that if I would come back to this relationship, and if I would like to feel fair in it I would also need to sleep with two guys as he did with two woman. He obviously rejected this idea, and he said that he doesn’t want to give me to anyone. 

He also was hardly able to accept the fact that I had feelings for another guy but he said he was willing to wait as long as he will need for me to forget this guy, and return back feelings for him.

Time goes by, and we started to be in a relationship again. At first, I was pretty cold. He would tell me that he loves me, and I wasn’t even able to say it back. I was feeling guilty for that, so after some time I started replying that I love him too.

Yet I was still obsessively thinking about that other guy which I know is very toxic, and I had a feeling that he have hurt a lot of women (emotionally) before bc he have slept with many of them (he told me that). He seemed to be an absolute player who breadcrumbs and switches between people (which I assumed) since he would be gone for weeks or even months. Yet he was always coming back even after a long disappearance, and it would make me hard to resist not to text him back.

At this point my now boyfriend asked me not to chat with other guys, so I ignored this guy’s messages, and he started to text me more. He was asking why I was ghosting him, and after some time I messaged him back by saying that we can no longer talk because I got back to my boyfriend, and he asked me not to chat with other guys. I also told him that I will still miss him.

He ignored me for some time. Maybe a month later he texted that he misses me, and had a dream about me that night. To which I responded that I don’t believe what he’s saying and he’s just playing games with me. He said that he was not playing, and he truly missed me to which I haven’t respond.

After some time, as always, he texted me asking how am I. To which I responded ‘Hi, I’m good’ not even asking how he was. He then said something, and I told him to stop texting me. He then said that he enjoyed spending time together. To which I replied me too, and I told him that he was playing with me all along, and it upset me. To which he said he didn’t play, and I haven’t replied to this message.

Couple months go by, and I was starting to think about him less and less. 

Now at the end of this January, couple months later, he texts me asking how am I. I got a glimpse of excitement when I saw his text to which I said I’m ok, and I hoped he’s too. Then he asked me if I wanted to text him at least once during this time, and I said no, bc I’m with my boyfriend now, which is true, I was never planning to text him first since I’m in a relationship now. We chatted for a week with long pauses. We spoke about morality, and I told him that it’s inappropriate for me to chat with him because I’m in a relationship. I then asked him to stop playing with me, and used sad emoji and repeated that we can’t chat, and said multiple times to stop texting me. He still messaged me saying that he would like to meet. To which I said we clearly can’t. We still had some conversations about morals and values during which I was responding cold and was not trying to engage the chat too much. He kept texting me, so I ignored him, and I decided to block him. After that I felt a lot better because I knew he could never reach out ever again. I also ignored him which in a way satisfied me but blocking him was the main thing that helped me to finally let him go.

At this point I already developed feelings for my now boyfriend, and am missing him, since we are in a long distance relationship atm but I was supposed to move to another country to be back with him this month.

Now he found out about my interactions with this other guy, and he couldn’t believe that I was ‘cheating’ on him by secretly chatting with this guy when we are in a full time relationship. He was extremely upset and angry. He said that he wants to end things between us and blocked me everywhere. Later unblocked me, and he couldn’t believe that I ‘cheated’ on him. We were talking, and I was dissociating, I had no feelings at all since I have quiet bpd. I was protecting myself from my overwhelming emotions for my own survival at that time.

To be honest, I didn’t even feel too bad replying to this guy because I felt unfair from the beginning of this relationship because my boyfriend slept with two women, and rejected me to do the same. I know that we were technically separated but it still made me upset. I couldn’t imagine him doing something with someone else while I wasn’t able to do that bc I still felt like I would be cheating even after a long time after we broke up. I felt betrayed, and extremely unfair, and in my mind I justified my action of answering text messages to the guy I was trying to end things with. Honestly, those messages let me leave my thoughts in the chat instead of in my head.

Now, when I finally seemed to be able to let go of the feelings for this guy, and started to attach, and have feelings for my boyfriend again he sais that he wants to break up with me, and accusing me of cheating.

Now after his reaction I felt like the worst person in the world and didn’t even want to exist anymore. My life seemed to be too complicated and hard to live.

My boyfriend said that he will tell everyone that I’m a cheater, and later told me to do it myself. I was in such a panic attack, and was scared that I will do something to myself, so I called my dad bc he had a history of cheating. I told him shortly the situation that I cheated, and that I don’t know how to deal with the guilt. Now I feel a bit awkward that I told that to my dad. I feel like I had to keep this personal information to myself but I was just on the edge at that time, and needed someone to talk to.

Now my boyfriend seemed to understand that he took me from an active situationship, and I needed time to recover from it, and I needed to have some conversations with that other guy to fully move on.

I really apologised to him for keeping it a secret, and as a result hurting him. I felt to have the right to answer this guy’s texts because I still didn’t think it was worse than him sleeping with those two women. Technically, I am guilty, and he didn’t do anything wrong because we were not together at that time. Even though, I told him before entering the relationship that I was not ready for it, and I attempted to end it but he still convinced me to start again. As I mentioned before, he also rejected my condition to sleep with two guys for me to feel fair again. Now after all this I am left guilty and a cheater. I’m not a stone I need time to adjust with my feelings. He knew that.

I honestly think that from my side it was more than love to come back to this relationship when I finally moved on, and did have feelings for another person. Especially that I didn’t feel safe in this relationship as he used to be really abusive. Leaving this relationship in a first place was the hardest decision I have ever made in my life, and now coming back after a year gap was a very difficult decision.

Now after all this I am left being guilty, and am ashamed of myself to the point where I just want to isolate from people and stop existing. Should I really beat myself so much for this?

1ixr5ib,https://www.reddit.com/r/dawsonscreek/comments/1ixr5ib/a_soft_dawn_in_the_city_one_shot/,A Soft Dawn in the City ( one shot )," ( To all the devoted Pacey and Joey fans who poured so much of their hearts into this couple, you truly deserve some comfort after all the twists, turns, and heartbreak that made us question everything. That’s why I decided to “set the record straight” by imagining the life they could have led together, far from all the painful separations and hesitations❤️ ) 

A soft dawn in the city : 

A pale dawn seeped into the loft through the wide windows, painting the exposed brick in a soft, golden hue. Outside, New York City stirred with a gentle rumble—car engines revving in the distance, streetlights blinking out one by one. Inside, everything was hushed, cradled in that stolen stretch of time between night and morning.

Joey sat in a cozy nook by the window, the muted glow haloing her dark hair and illuminating the graceful planes of her face. She wore a simple tank top and loose pajama pants, her delicate collarbones peeking out from the thin straps as she rocked their newborn daughter, Emma, in her arms. The baby’s fuzzy head nestled against the curve of her mother’s shoulder, impossibly small, impossibly precious. There was a tender hush in Joey’s expression, like she couldn’t quite believe her own luck. Once upon a time, she had dreamed of this life—complete, secure, drenched in love—but it had felt so elusive. Now, it was here, warm and tangible.

“Anyone else around here awake enough to appreciate my coffee-making prowess?” came a voice behind her.

Joey suppressed a smile, turning to see Pacey leaning against the counter. He wore a worn gray T-shirt that clung to the breadth of his shoulders and sat just snug enough around his arms to hint at his solid build—one shaped by years of hauling sails and living life on his own terms. Dark stubble shadowed his jaw, and his hair was slightly tousled as if he’d raked his fingers through it too many times. A mischievous glint danced in his eyes, the kind that always managed to set Joey’s pulse thrumming.

“Pacey Witter, barista extraordinaire,” Joey murmured, lips curving teasingly. “I’d applaud if I wasn’t busy making sure our child doesn’t decide to serenade the entire building at this hour.”

He placed a mug on the counter and stretched his arms overhead in a languid movement, revealing a sliver of toned stomach above low-slung pajama pants. Joey’s gaze flicked there for a fleeting second—warmth rippling through her that had nothing to do with the sweltering summer morning. Her heart gave a little twist at how much she still wanted him.

“Serenade, huh?” Pacey crossed to her, hands slipping around Joey’s waist from behind. She felt the shift of his strong chest against her back as he leaned down, pressing a soft kiss to her shoulder. “Is that what you call it when this tiny angel decides to practice her banshee wail at three in the morning?”

Joey rolled her eyes, but her lips twitched with affection. “Don’t be rude,” she said, trying to sound stern, though warmth suffused her tone. “I happen to like her singing voice. Has a certain… shrill charm.”

Pacey’s breath fanned over her neck as he laughed. “Well, I guess we can’t fault Emma for wanting to get your attention. I’ve wanted that for most of my life.”

Joey felt a pleasant heat course through her cheeks. “Stop flirting with me when I’m holding our baby,” she scolded, though she didn’t move away. Instead, she leaned back into him, savoring the feel of his body behind hers. His arms felt safe, strong—a place she could nestle into without reservation.

Their daughter, roused by the soft vibrations of their voices, let out a quiet coo. Joey repositioned her gently, pressing a whisper of a kiss to the downy head. Emma’s eyes fluttered, large and curious—an enchanting mix of both parents’ features.

Pacey came around to face them, a sly grin tugging at the corner of his mouth. Joey’s gaze danced over his broad chest, the slight silver chain around his neck—something he’d picked up during a summer away—and the strong column of his throat. This man, she thought, had saved her from her own doubts more times than she could count. That knowledge only intensified the love spiraling in her chest.

He brushed Emma’s cheek with the back of his forefinger, voice lowered in awe. “I swear, every time I look at her, I’m floored all over again.”

Joey’s lips parted, a soft exhale escaping. She took a moment to let her eyes linger on Pacey’s features—the dark lashes that framed his thoughtful gaze, the slight crook of his nose that lent him that rakish charm, and the smile that still turned her insides to liquid. “Tell me about it,” she whispered. “Sometimes I think I’m dreaming.”

Pacey carefully slipped the baby into the curve of his arms, cradling her with a gentleness that made Joey’s heart clench. It was mesmerizing, watching him become someone’s father—someone who could rock an infant at dawn in a Manhattan loft and still manage a grin that had once spelled trouble back in their hometown. Emma’s little fist closed around one of his fingers, and she let out a soft gurgle that made Joey’s chest burn with affection.

“I wish I could freeze this moment,” he murmured, glancing up at Joey with the unabashed adoration that never failed to fluster her. “Then again, I’m kind of looking forward to showing her the whole city. Maybe tomorrow she’ll appreciate a bagel run?”

Joey snorted. “I don’t think she can handle bagels just yet, Pace. Let’s not traumatize her with your obsession. I’m not sure she’s ready for the jam-packed chaos of the bagel shop on West 72nd.”

A playful glint sparked in his eyes. “And deprive our daughter of the quintessential New York experience? Shame on you, Josephine Potter.”

She rolled her eyes but couldn’t help giggling—quiet enough not to wake Emma, loud enough for Pacey to catch that glimmer in her laugh. The banter between them felt as natural and essential as breathing. It was a link to the younger versions of themselves—kids who had once believed that dreaming big would carry them somewhere they couldn’t quite name.

“Yeah, well,” Joey teased, stepping closer, “let’s not rush into turning her into a city girl before she can hold her head up on her own. Baby steps, remember?”

Pacey’s grin turned lopsided. “You’re the boss.”

He pressed a soft kiss to Emma’s temple, then extended his free hand to Joey. She took it, felt the slight callus along the inside of his palm from years of working on boats, felt that unspoken comfort settle in. With deft care, she guided them both over to the small couch near the window, which was draped in a soft throw. The city outside began to warm with a deeper, more honeyed glow, revealing rooftops and water towers silhouetted against a pastel horizon.

They sat, and Pacey released a contented sigh as Emma settled, blinking her heavy lids. Joey curled her feet under her, leaning her head against Pacey’s shoulder so that she could bask in that medley of warmth—his lean form pressed to her side, the baby’s quiet presence in his arms, and the languid hush of a New York morning that belonged solely to them.

He turned slightly, letting his gaze flick over Joey with open appreciation. She noticed, and a subtle warmth lit her cheeks again. Even now, after all the times they’d been close—after carrying his child and sharing countless nights tangled in each other’s arms—there was still something electric about the way he looked at her. He always seemed hungry for her, in that gentle, yearning way that said he was as enthralled by the curve of her shoulder and the softness of her lips as he’d ever been.

“You know, you look beautiful,” he said, quiet so as not to startle Emma. His free hand skimmed along Joey’s arm, thumb brushing lightly over her warm skin.

Joey cocked an eyebrow. “Pacey, I’m wearing pajamas covered in spit-up stains. My hair’s doing this weird frizzy thing—”

“And I still think you look like the eighth wonder of the world,” he cut in, matter-of-fact. His grin softened, the tip of his nose brushing hers. “There’s nothing in this city, or any other, that outshines you right now.”

She leaned into him, letting their foreheads touch, heart brimming with gratitude and amusement. “You really know how to keep a girl around, Witter.”

“Oh, I’m just full of talents,” he deadpanned, arching an eyebrow playfully. “Must be my unstoppable charm, or maybe the fact that you’ve finally recognized my unparalleled coffee-making abilities.”

“You’re such an idiot,” she said softly, but the sweetness behind her words was undeniable. She nuzzled closer and closed her eyes, breathing in his scent—coffee, faint cologne, and that intangible note that was purely Pacey. A wave of happiness washed through her, buoyed by memories of how they first discovered each other, first fought and laughed, first realized the depth of feeling that linked them.

A sleepy little yawn from Emma broke the moment, and Pacey exchanged a conspiratorial grin with Joey. “Tiny dictator calls the shots,” he teased. “Even if she doesn’t talk yet.”

“Think she’s ready for another nap?” Joey asked, glancing down. Emma’s eyelids drooped again, and Joey could practically see her drifting off.

Pacey nodded, rising carefully. His movements were unhurried and precise, as though he were handling a priceless masterpiece. In truth, he was. Their daughter, her entire existence so delicate and new, her eyes heavy with the promise of a thousand tomorrows.

They returned Emma to her small crib in the adjoining bedroom, still in eyeshot of the living area. When they tiptoed back to the couch, an easy sort of silence cocooned them. Joey felt that familiar pull—how the simplest gestures turned warm and electric whenever they were alone.

She turned toward Pacey, letting her hands slide up the solid planes of his chest, pressing lightly against the toned warmth she found beneath the thin fabric of his T-shirt. He caught her wrists and drew her in, and she felt a ripple of excitement swirl in her stomach, a reminder of the youthful longing that had once kept her awake at night.

“You do realize how crazy all this is,” she said, voice dipping low. “Us… in a city we used to only dream about, raising a beautiful baby girl… all of it.”

“I realize I’m the luckiest man alive,” Pacey replied, searching her eyes. “I mean that, Jo. You… Emma… everything.”

She bit back a smile that threatened to melt her. “I guess… I guess we managed to turn our daydreams into reality somehow.”

“It’s all that stubbornness we share,” he teased, sliding his fingers through her hair. “And a dash of fate, maybe.”

She tilted her head, letting the sweep of his knuckles brush her cheek. “I like believing in fate,” she admitted softly. “Especially after everything that’s happened—like maybe we were always supposed to be here.”

“Together,” he finished. Then his eyes flicked to her mouth, and he leaned in, pressing a slow, tender kiss to her lips. It felt new and familiar all at once—a gentle claiming, underscored by the deep well of intimacy that bound them.

Joey sighed against his mouth, her arms looping around his neck as his hands splayed against the dip of her waist. They kissed with a warmth that spoke of homecoming and promise, the city beyond their windows lighting up inch by inch as the sun climbed higher.

When they finally broke apart, foreheads touching in a shared breath, the hush in the room resonated with quiet contentment. Joey reached for his hand and squeezed it, letting the moment settle like a soft blanket over them both.

Outside, New York stretched into a swirl of early-morning routine—commuters rushing, deliveries being made, life thriving at every corner. But here, in their loft, time unspooled in sweet, deliberate calm. They would soon face the day’s demands—diaper changes, feedings, a thousand small tasks—but for now, it was just them.

“Looks like the city’s waking up,” Pacey observed, glancing at the sun now illuminating buildings in a brighter yellow light. “We could go back to bed for a bit… or,” he added, eyes glinting mischievously, “we could attempt to finish that coffee if you’re brave.”

Joey’s laughter was warm, bouncing off the loft’s bare walls. “Let’s be bold,” she said, tugging him toward the kitchen. “Emma’s asleep. We can’t waste a single precious moment of quiet.”

He followed with a mock-salute, shoulders relaxed, that lopsided grin returning. “Yes, ma’am. Just promise to share that couch with me before the day gets too crazy. Might need a mid-morning nap.”

She caught his gaze, let herself soak in the easy affection that radiated there. “Deal,” she said, voice soft, “as long as you keep looking at me like that.”

Pacey’s eyes traveled over her again, lingering on the curve of her hip, the elegant line of her neck, the glow in her eyes. “Oh, don’t worry, Jo. I’m not planning on looking anywhere else.”

And as they set off to sip lukewarm coffee and savor a fleeting, ordinary moment of morning routine, the air felt charged by the simple knowledge that their love—tender, deep, and joyously uncontainable—had found a home at last. The city would keep spinning, time would keep pulling them forward, but none of that changed the feeling that filled the loft: a gentle, all-encompassing devotion that bound them, more powerfully than any words could convey.",1,1740476033.0,dawsonscreek,0,1.0,False
1ixr3qf,https://i.redd.it/mk5y7tc689le1.png,Update: Tokyo Ghoul Coffee is Happening!!,"

Two weeks ago, I made a post discussing the idea of creating an Anteiku-inspired coffee brand:  
https://www.reddit.com/r/TokyoGhoul/s/Ch3U7Ie3qK

I received great feedback from friends in ecommerce and from the community on my last post. Since then, I’ve been working non-stop on the project, conducting market research, contacting suppliers, and designing materials for the brand.  

Initially, this was just a passion project and a potential introduction to the coffee industry. However, after investing a significant amount of time into market research, I’m now seeing a lot of potential—not just for creating a Tokyo Ghoul coffee brand, but for an entire Anime-inspired coffee brand.  

Finding a coffee supplier was by far the most challenging part. I reached out to around 15 suppliers, 8 responded, 3 offered reasonable pricing, and only 1 had high-quality, ethically sourced coffee.  

As of now, I’ve purchased a domain and have had several discussions with my supplier about the types of coffee blends we can create. Here are some of the blends we’ve discussed so far:  
- Spider Lily Blend: A medium-dark roast with floral tasting notes. (Confirmed)  
- Juuzou’s Sweet Brew: A medium-light roast with naturally sweet flavors. (Confirmed)  
- Rize’s Temptation: A decaf option. (TBD)  
- Black Reaper: Ideally a dark roast. (TBD)  
- Shuu’s Special: A fruity single-origin coffee.  

I’d love to hear more ideas for character- or scene-inspired blends, not just from Tokyo Ghoul but from other anime as well. If I end up creating a coffee based on your idea, I’ll send you the coffee you helped create—for free! 😊  

PS: I created a Google Form to better understand the community’s preferences. I’d really appreciate it if you could fill it out 🙏. As a thank-you, anyone who completes the survey and provides an email will receive a redeemable code for a free coffee mug or stickers once I launch in couple weeks.

TL;DR:  
I’m creating an Anime-inspired coffee brand, starting with Tokyo Ghoul-themed blends like Spider Lily and Juuzou’s Sweet Brew. After extensive research, I’ve secured a supplier and bought a domain.

It started with just being able to run SELECT queries and not being much different from the [official one](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/mcp), but this weekend I've added ability to execute any type of SQL query (provided I ask Cursor to turn this on) and integrated with management API (to manage auth, db config, and everything it has to offer).

So now I can just prompt Cursor to build & manage a complete database for me 😳 Asked it to create a database for an e-commerce store, got:  
\- 1 db schema  
\- 6 relational tables (users, products, categories, orders, etc.)  
\- 18 RLS policies   
\- 8 edge functions including search and recommendations  
\- 10 automated triggers for inventory and order management  
\- 1 analytics view 

The cool part is, this MCP server has tools to help Cursor get to know the db (it can query for metadata on schemas, tables, open api spec of management api) so it will not hallucinate table or schema names or if it does it can quickly recover

The other thing that I've added is a safety mode 👷‍♂️ - by default my server will NOT be able to write to your database or use destructive resources from the management API -- however, you can just ask Cursor ""enable write mode and ~~feel free to f\*ck up my database~~ modify my database tables to achieve this task"". Be careful though.

**Latest release**

Just launched a v0.3.2 with transaction bug-fixes which makes all of this possible.

  
**How to setup**:

* Install with: `pipx install supabase-mcp-server`
* Run with `supabase-mcp-server`
* Connection config is managed by an `.env` file

**Roadmap:**

* I'm building the roadmap for v0.4 but overall the vision is to allow you to manage your Supabase from IDE end-to-end

 **Repo and readme:**

Enjoy 😊

1ixr0fy,https://www.reddit.com/r/sharedworkspace/comments/1ixr0fy/why_are_freelancers_choosing_shared_office_spaces/,Why are freelancers choosing shared office spaces?,"# What is a shared office space?

So, what exactly is a [shared office space](https://storagegleniris.net.au/office-for-rent-melbourne/shared-office-space/)? Well, picture this: it’s like all the best parts of working from home or a café, but without the constant coffee shop noise or the temptation to take a “quick” nap on your sofa. It’s a communal workspace where freelancers, remote workers, and small businesses can actually get stuff done.

In Melbourne, where I’ve set up shop, these spaces are booming. Why? Because freelancers like us are tired of balancing laptops on shaky café tables or trying to ignore the laundry pile staring us down at home. I know—I’ve been there. That’s why I knew a shared office was exactly what we all needed: a professional yet laid-back spot to work, without the crazy overhead costs of renting an entire office.

# Why I built shared spaces (and why they’ll work for you)

When I made the jump from freelancing to running coworking spaces, I knew exactly what freelancers needed because I’d been there myself. Let me break down why shared spaces are a game-changer for people like us.

# No More Distractions

If you’re like me, trying to work from home or a café can be a disaster. I lost count of how many times I was interrupted by the washing machine or the café next to me turning into a concert venue. Studies show that having a dedicated workspace can boost productivity by up to 30%. Trust me, having a quiet space to focus makes all the difference—I was able to get so much more done when I wasn’t battling distractions.

# Collaboration Without Competition

Freelancing can get lonely. One of the things I missed most was bouncing ideas off other professionals and collaborating on projects. That’s why I designed my coworking spaces to make networking feel natural. Harvard Business Review found that 70% of people in shared spaces feel more productive and healthier, and I’ve seen it in action. Freelancers here share projects, refer clients, and actually connect in ways they never could work solo.

# Affordability

Back when I was freelancing, renting a private office wasn’t even on the table—it was just too expensive. In Melbourne, office leases can run over $1,200 a month! But with coworking spaces, you can have all the perks of a professional setup for much less. Hot desks start at around $300 a month, so you’re getting flexibility and professionalism without the massive price tag.

# What are the different types of shared workspaces for freelancers like you?

As a freelancer, I often wished I could choose a workspace that suited my mood or project. Some days I needed a quiet spot to focus, and other days I craved a more lively, collaborative atmosphere. That’s why, when I created my coworking spaces, I made sure to include options for every kind of freelancer.

||
||
|**Type of Workspace**|**Description**|**Price Range (AUD)**|**Best For**|
|*Hot Desk*|Shared, unassigned desks. First come, first served.|$250 – $400/month|Freelancers who like flexibility and variety|
|*Personal Desk*|Your own fixed desk in a shared environment.|$400 – $600/month|People who need a consistent spot|
|*Private Office*|A fully private, enclosed office.|$800 – $1200+/month|Teams or individuals needing a quiet, private space|

# Hot Desk

Sometimes, I needed a change of scenery and didn’t want to commit to one desk all the time. Hot desks are perfect for that! [Studies](https://www.cipd.org/globalassets/media/knowledge/knowledge-hub/reports/2023-pdfs/2023-flexible-hybrid-working-practices-report-8392.pdf) have shown that 62% of workers using hot desks feel they get more networking opportunities. It’s a great way to keep things fresh and meet new people without locking yourself in one spot.

# Personal Desk

Having a consistent space was a lifesaver when I freelanced. It gave me a sense of routine, which is key to staying productive. Did you know that[ 75% of freelancers](https://www.founderjar.com/freelance-statistics/) say having a dedicated workspace increases their productivity? This is perfect for those who value a stable, familiar environment while still enjoying the perks of a shared office.

# Private Office

When I needed to buckle down or had big client meetings, nothing beat the peace of a private office. Having that space to focus made all the difference. Private offices are a great option for those who need some headspace or want to work without interruptions. And compared to the typical $1,200+ monthly cost of renting an office in Melbourne, it’s a much more affordable option.

# Solving freelancers’ biggest challenges with my shared office space

As a former freelancer, I’ve experienced firsthand the challenges of working independently. To address these issues, I founded this coworking space, offering a supportive community and practical amenities designed to enhance productivity and well-being.

* **Isolation:** Let’s be real—freelancing can get lonely. I missed the daily chats with colleagues and the simple act of being around other people. That’s why I made building a community a top priority in my space. According to [Deskmag’s Global Coworking Survey](https://www.deskmag.com/en/coworking-news/1st-results-of-the-3rd-global-coworking-survey-2012), 89% of coworkers say they feel less isolated, and that’s exactly what I wanted for the freelancers who work here. You’ll have plenty of chances to connect and collaborate, but in a way that feels natural, not forced.
* **Lack of structure:** One of the hardest things about freelancing is keeping work and home life separate. I know how easy it is to let work bleed into your personal time when you’re working from home. That’s why my coworking space is designed to give freelancers structure. Here, you can set clear work hours, maintain a routine, and finally enjoy your free time without guilt.
* **Professionalism:** I’ve had my fair share of client meetings in noisy coffee shops and awkward video calls from my kitchen. It’s not the best look. That’s why I made sure my shared office spaces provide a professional setting. You’ll have a polished environment where you can meet clients, host meetings, or just look more credible when pitching your freelance services.

# Is a coworking space or shared office space right for you?

When I made the leap from freelancing to managing coworking spaces, I quickly realised it wasn’t the right fit for every freelancer. But for those like me—freelancers looking for more structure, community, and professionalism—it’s a game-changer. Here’s how to figure out if it’s the right move for you:

* Do distractions at home make it tough to focus?
* Do you miss the social side of working with others?
* Would having access to things like meeting rooms and reliable internet make your work life easier, without the headache of a long-term lease?

If you’re nodding along, then a coworking space might be the change you need. Personally, transitioning into a shared workspace gave me the structure and professionalism that helped me thrive as a freelancer.

Chapter #1: Rum and coke

My dad is waiting for me just outside the school, like always, in his beat-up Honda that barely runs. The car shakes violently at stoplights, the engine clanking loud enough to make people glance over, but he never reacts. He just grips the steering wheel and stares straight ahead. I don’t try to make conversation—I know better. We drive home in silence, the only sounds made are by the car engine and the faint hum of a radio station barely coming through the static.

Eventually we stop in front of the run-down duplex that we call home. The siding is cracked, the roof sags, and the porch light flickers like it’s gasping for life. The inside isn’t much easier on the eyes. The walls are gray and not a ‘modern’ aesthetic grey either, the lights are dim and fluorescent—like something ripped straight out of an abandoned hospital. Cold and lifeless. I step inside, and the same feeling of fear and overwhelming numbness surges forward.
I don’t wait around. I make a beeline for my room, avoiding any chance of awkward small talk or, worse yet, getting caught in the crossfire of whatever mood my parents are in tonight.

But even behind my closed door, I hear them. I always hear them.

At first, it’s just words—sharp, angry, cutting into each other like knives. Then it escalates. It always escalates.  

“You think this is my fault?” Dad’s voice is low, dangerous. The kind that makes my stomach tighten.  

Mom laughs, but it’s not real—it’s bitter, sharp. “You don’t do anything, Michael. You just sit there, acting like you're some victim while this whole family falls apart.”  

Dad slams his fist on the table. “I work every damn day to keep a roof over your head—”  

“Barely!” Mom shouts, her voice cracking. “We’re drowning, Michael! And you’re just—just coasting through like none of this matters!”  

“Don’t put this on me, Jane,” he snaps. “You’re the one who comes home reeking of booze. You’re the one who disappears for hours while *I*—”  

“While you what?” Mom cuts him off. “Sit on your ass and pretend everything’s fine? You think I’m the problem?”  

Dad lets out a harsh, bitter laugh. “You are the problem. You know how much money you’ve pissed away on alcohol? How many bills we could’ve actually paid if you weren’t wasting it all on getting shitfaced?”  

Mom stiffens. Her grip tightens on the counter, knuckles white.  

Dad doesn’t stop. “We wouldn’t be living in this dump if you could keep a goddamn job. But no—every time you get close, you screw it up, because you can’t go one week without drinking yourself stupid.”  

“Fuck you,” Mom spits, her voice shaking. “You think I want to be like this? You think I wake up every morning choosing this?”  

Dad’s jaw clenches. “You sure as hell don’t do anything to stop it.”  

The words hang there, thick and suffocating.  

Without warning, Mom grabs the nearest thing—a glass, still half-full of water—and hurls it at the wall.  

It shatters. A thousand tiny shards scatter across the floor, catching the dim light like broken stars.  

Dad exhales sharply through his nose, gripping the bridge of his nose like he’s holding back everything he really wants to say. Then he shakes his head. “You’re a goddamn mess.”  

Mom’s face twists, like he just slapped her. For a second, she just stands there, breathing heavy. Then, quieter but sharper, she whispers, “I hate you.”  

Dad just stares at her, something unreadable in his eyes. Then he turns, heading for the front door.  

“Yeah,” he mutters. “Well, the feeling’s mutual.”  

Mom doesn’t respond right away. Then I the jingle of her keys and the creak of an opening door.

Dad’s jaw clenches, “You’re really leaving to drink again? Are you that pathetic?”

The door slams in his face, rattling the walls.

—————————————————————

Jane sits at the far end of the bar, slumped
 over the counter, her fingers loosely gripping a glass. The dim neon glow from the beer signs casts shifting shadows over her face, deepening the hollowness beneath her eyes. The bartender eyes her warily as she raises a hand, signaling for another round.

""Rum and Coke,"" she slurs, her voice barely more than a whisper.

The bartender hesitates. ""Jane, maybe you should call it a night.""

She scoffs, pushing her empty glass forward. ""Just one more.""

Reluctantly, he pours her a drink and slides it over. One after another, she orders drink after drink—a desperate attempt to numb the pain, until eventually, the bouncer steps in.

""Alright, Jane. That's enough,"" he declares firmly, pulling her arm as she reaches for the bottle behind the counter.

""I’ll tell you when I’m done!"" she protests, but her strength is already fading.

In seconds, she's hauled off her stool and dragged toward the door. She stumbles, her heel catching on the floor, and crashes against the frame. The cold night air hits her like a slap as the door slams shut behind her, leaving her swaying alone on the pavement.

With a deep, shuddering breath, she forces herself to move, the blurred street lights merging into one long, uncertain line as she makes her way home.

—————————————————————

The house is quiet now, except for the occasional creak of the old pipes and the rats scurrying through the cracks in the walls. 

My room is cold tonight. I lay on my heavily stained mattress under my torn blanket and shiver, trying to ward off the chills. 
Sleep doesn’t come easily. I drift in and out, never fully resting. My throat is sore. My chest is tight. A cough rattles through me, sharp and painful. The air is thick, heavy, almost suffocating. Violently I coughed trying to rid my throat of the toxic air alas the more i struggled the worse it got. My breathing turns into shallow gasps It hurt to breathe, the air had become not only heavy but sharp and painful, every inhale like swallowing glass. By this point my breaths were short, intense huffs attempting to satisfy my lungs' need for oxygen. 

At that very moment the front door opens loud enough to wake the rats, the hallway light flicks on outside my room. 

Slow, heavy and disgruntled footsteps. Then my door creaks open. It’s mom.

She leans against the doorframe, unmoving at first. Her eyes are glazed over, unfocused. Then, without warning, she stumbles forward.

A dull thud echoes through the room as she collapses to the floor.

My lungs burn yet I scramble out of bed, nearly tripping over the blanket as I drop to my knees beside her.

""Mom?"" My voice is barely a whisper, hoarse and raw. My hands shake as I grab her arm, trying to shake her awake. Her skin is cold, too cold.

”No, no, no, no”

I start hyperventilating uncontrollably, unable to gather myself, my vision blurring with tears from the overwhelming pain and confusion i plead, ""Wake up. Please wake up.""

Nothing.

I shake her harder, my heartbeat thundering in my ears, My whole body burning. She groans softly but doesn’t open her eyes. An indescribable wave of relief crashes over me, but it’s short-lived.

I glance toward the hallway, debating whether to call for Dad. He won’t help. He’ll just sigh, maybe mutter something under his breath, then go back to pretending none of this is happening.

“I have to do something”

With trembling hands, I reach for the house phone and dial 911. My voice is weak and shaky, barely understandable, as I explain that my mom won’t wake up, that she reeks of alcohol, that she’s breathing but barely. The operator keeps me on the line until an ambulance arrives, soon red and blue lights are flashing outside our broken windows.

Dad doesn’t say a word as the paramedics load Mom onto a stretcher. He just stands in the doorway, arms crossed, jaw tight. 

""She did this to herself,"" he mutters.

I don’t respond. I just watch as the ambulance pulls away, taking her with it.

The house is quiet again, but it doesn’t feel like peace. For the first time, I wonder if things will ever get better or if this is just how life is meant to be.  

The silence doesn’t last. The next few days blur together whispers between adults, my dad pacing the kitchen, the front door opening and closing at odd hours. I stop keeping track of time. At some point, I realize I haven’t seen Mom since the night everything fell apart. No slurred words. No stumbling footsteps. No angry outbursts breaking the silence.  

And somehow, that silence is worse.  

I catch snippets of conversations I’m not supposed to hear—Dad murmuring into the phone, using words like ""evaluation"" and ""detox."" My aunt stopping by, lowering her voice when she sees me. I pretend not to care, but my chest tightens anyway. No one tells me anything. 
Then Mom comes home.  

She looks... different. Not just tired, but hollow, like something in her broke. Her face is pale, her eyes dull, and for the first time in a long time, she smells like nothing at all. No cheap wine clinging to her breath, no sickly-sweet vodka masking the weight of her exhaustion. Just the scent of old laundry and something sterile, like a hospital room that she was in for too long or not long enough.  

She barely speaks that first day. Just nods when Dad helps her inside, flinches when he touches her shoulder, then disappears into the bedroom. I hear the lock click. I don’t knock.  

The days after that pass in slow motion. She sleeps a lot. Sometimes, I hear her moving around, but she never comes out when I’m in the room. The house feels like it’s holding its breath, waiting for something to snap back to the way it was. I wonder if it will. If she will.  

I hear her and Dad talking in hushed voices, the word ""help"" slipping through the cracks of their conversation.  

I don’t ask questions. I don’t trust the answers. But then, one night, I hear something else. A chair scraping against the kitchen floor, the quiet clink of a mug instead of the slosh of a bottle. And then her voice—steady, serious.  

""I'm going to a meeting tomorrow.""  

I don’t know what to say.  

One chilly evening a couple  after the incident, I found myself sitting in a cramped community center, forced into an aa meeting by a caseworker who insisted I needed to understand what my mom was fighting for. I had always known the woman who stumbled home in a haze, the one whose drunken laughter once drowned out my cries so it was hard to believe my mom was really sober and fighting for anything.

I sat in the back, trying to hide from everyone, an instinct, while the circle of strangers took turns sharing their stories. The air felt heavy with shared pain and tentative hope. Soon enough it was her turn to speak. 

Jane—my mom—stood up with a tentative resolve. In a clear, steady voice she said, “Hi, my name is Jane, and I’m an alcoholic.”

Her words cut through the room like a dagger piercing my ears. I remembered the nights when her words were slurred and incoherent, punctuated by fits of anger or sorrow. Now, there was an honesty there I’d never seen before. 

She continued, “I remember the humiliation of being thrown out of a bar—ordering a rum and coke, of all things. I was so lost that night; the sting of rejection, the cold slap of reality, forced me to see that I’d hit rock bottom.” 

My throat burned as I listened, fighting the words that wanted to come out as I sat silently. The woman I had always feared was now bare and vulnerable, laying her mistakes on the table for everyone to see. 

A gentle voice from across the circle said, “You’re not alone, Jane. We’re all here with you.” 

That simple act of humanity sent a shiver down my spine. For the first time in years, I saw my mother not as someone distant and broken but as someone capable of change. Yet, I couldn’t help but feel conflicted. Part of me clung to the old memories of those nights filled with anger, neglect, and sorrow. However, another part of me dared to hope that maybe things could be different.

Chapter 2: Three months

The smell of burnt eggs clings to the air when I walk into the kitchen. Dad stands at the stove, his back turned, scraping a pan too aggressively. Mom sits at the table, a mug in her hands, staring at nothing. She’s been doing that a lot lately.  

I hesitate at the doorway. The idea of sitting down with them makes my stomach twist, but Mom’s therapist says family meals will help mend the household, so now we’re doing this. Forced dinners, like we’re some picture-perfect family all of the sudden.  

I take the farthest seat from Dad. The chair legs screech against the floor, and both of them glance up for a second before returning to their own quiet worlds.  

“Morning,” Mom says eventually. Her voice is hoarse, like she spent all night screaming. Or crying.  

I nod and grab a piece of toast. It’s cold.  

Dad sets a plate in front of me, a half-burnt mess of eggs and something that’s supposed to be bacon. I push it around with my fork, but I’m not really hungry. I can feel him watching me. My shoulders tense, waiting for him to say something, he doesn’t.  

Mom takes a sip of her coffee, clears her throat, and looks at me like she’s forcing herself to. “I have another meeting after work today.”  

AA. She doesn’t say it, but we all know what she means.  

“Cool,” I mutter. It comes out too harsh, but I don’t fix it. She wants me to act like this is some big step, like she’s really trying this time, but all I can think about still is how many nights I spent listening to her slurred words and hoping she wouldn’t choke in her sleep.  

Dad exhales through his nose like he’s about to say something, but he stops himself. We eat in silence. The air is thick, every scrape of a fork on a plate dragging against my skin like nails on a chalkboard.  

After school, I walk home faster than usual. I used to take my time clinging to backroads, desperate to avoid the next screaming match. Now, the house is quieter, but that doesn’t mean it’s better.  

When I get inside, Dad’s on the couch, flipping through channels like he’s just trying to keep his hands busy. He glances up but doesn’t say anything. Mom’s not home yet—probably at her meeting.  

I go to my room, locking the door behind me. It’s still my space, the one place where I don’t have to pretend. But it’s not the same. It’s too quiet. I lay on my bed and stare at the ceiling, but my brain won’t shut up.  

“What if mom starts drinking again?”

”What if therapy makes her realize she doesn’t actually want to get better?”

“What if Dad snaps?”

“What if things do go back to normal, the way they were. “

I squeeze my eyes shut and force myself to breathe. In, out. In, out. Like the therapist told me, It doesn’t help.  

I zone out and the next thing I know, Mom is calling me for dinner.  

I don't move at first. I don’t want to go. Sitting across from Dad makes my skin crawl. Sitting next to Mom makes my chest ache. But if I skip, that’ll start something, and I don’t have the energy for another fight.  

So reluctantly I go.  

Dinner is just as awful as breakfast, except this time, we’re pretending harder. Mom tries to make conversation, asks me how school was, what I learned. Dad just chews. I mumble half-assed answers.  

“This is good,” Mom says after a long pause, picking at her food. “Us eating together.”  

No one replies.  

Her smile falters, and I can tell she’s fighting the urge to say more, to push. She probably wants someone to tell her they’re proud of her or that they believe in her. But no one says anything, not even her.

After dinner, we pile into the car for family therapy. I sit in the back, staring out the window, counting streetlights to keep my brain occupied.  

The office is small and smells like peppermint. The therapist, Ms. Sanders, greets us with that soft, patient voice that makes my skin itch.  

She starts with small talk, then shifts to Mom. “How has the transition been for you, Jane?”  

Mom sits up a little straighter. “It’s been… different. I’ve been sober for three months now.”  

“That’s wonderful.” Ms. Sanders smiles like this is a big achievement. Maybe it is. But it’s also months weeks. Three months compared to years.  

“And how are things at home?”  

Mom glances at me, then Dad. “Quieter.”  

Ms. Sanders nods. “Matt, how have you been feeling about the changes?”  

I shrug. “It’s whatever.”  

Her smile stays, but her eyes sharpen. “Change can be difficult, even when it’s positive.”  

I don’t respond.  

Dad clears his throat, shifting in his chair like he wants to leave. I stare at the floor, counting the tiles beneath my feet.  

“One thing I’d like to focus on,” Ms. Sanders continues, “is rebuilding trust. This isn’t just about recovery, it's about mending relationships.”  

I clench my fists. “Trust?“

She’s looking at Dad now. “Michael, how do you feel about everything?”  

He hesitates, then leans forward slightly, rubbing his hands together. “I think Jane is making an effort.”  

That’s all he says.

The rest of the session blurs. Something about how mom wants to get better, for herself, for the family, for me. Makes its way into my ears. Dad stays quiet. I answer as little as possible, mom’s statement lingering in my mind. 

When it’s finally over, we go home. Mom drops her purse by the door and exhales, rubbing her face.  

“I’m going to bed,” I mutter, already heading to my room.  

I don’t wait for a reply.  

The house feels heavier than before. Or maybe it’s just me.  

Next week will be the same. more forced meals, another therapy session, another AA meeting. Another week of pretending things are fine.

I’m building a niche B2C SaaS called BrewLog, a digital coffee journal designed for coffee enthusiasts to track their brews, refine their recipes, and improve their coffee experience over time. It’s meant for home brewers, baristas, and anyone who takes their coffee seriously.

Marketing something niche has been a challenge, and I’m trying to figure out the best way to reach the right audience. Some ideas I’ve had include engaging in coffee-related Reddit communities (this worked very well, however I went over the top and got shadow-banned), building a social media presence on platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and Twitter, writing blog content focused on brewing techniques and coffee journaling, collaborating with YouTubers and influencers in the coffee space, and possibly setting up a referral program to encourage users to share the app.

I’m not sure which of these would be the most effective, or if there are other approaches I haven’t considered.

Iceland is one of the best places on Earth to witness the mesmerizing Northern Lights (Aurora Borealis), but catching them requires a mix of luck, timing, and strategy. Here’s how to maximize your chances and make the most of this magical experience!  

🚀 **Where to See the Northern Lights in Iceland**  
While technically possible to see the Northern Lights anywhere in Iceland, some spots are better than others due to less light pollution:  

1️⃣ **Reykjavik and Nearby Areas**  
You *can* spot the Northern Lights in Reykjavik, but light pollution makes it tougher. Drive 20 minutes outside the city center to darker areas like the road toward Leirvogsvatn for a better view.  

2️⃣ **Keflavik Airport Area**  
If you’re near Keflavik, head to Gunnuhver Hot Springs. It’s a quick 10-15 minute drive, has parking, and offers a south-facing view with minimal light interference.  

3️⃣ **Selfoss and the South Coast**  
Near Selfoss? Drive to routes 33 and 34 by Eyrarbakki for a coastal view of the lights.  

4️⃣ **Vik, Akureyri, and Beyond**  
Regardless of where you are in Iceland, find a dark spot with minimal light pollution. Places like Vik or Akureyri can be great if the skies are clear.  

🔍 **How to Maximize Your Chances**  
The Northern Lights are a natural phenomenon, so you need the right conditions:  
🌃 **Dark Skies**: Get as far from cities and towns as possible to avoid light pollution.  
☁️ **Clear Skies**: Clouds can block your view, so check the [Icelandic Met Office’s Aurora Forecast](https://en.vedur.is/weather/forecasts/aurora/) for cloud cover and aurora activity.  
💫 **Aurora Forecast**: The higher the activity level (on a scale of 0-9), the better your chances. Even a level 3 can deliver a stunning show!  

🚗 **Should You Drive or Join a Tour?**  
- **Driving**: Gives you flexibility to chase clear skies and avoid crowds.  
- **Tours**: If driving isn’t an option, consider a [Northern Lights tour](https://mindtrip.ai/z/RbQbw1) that includes a lifetime guarantee—retry for free if you don’t see them!  

✨ **Tips for the Best Experience**  
- **Pack Warm**: Bring hot tea, coffee, and blankets to stay cozy while waiting.  
- **Park Safely**: Use parking areas or laybys to avoid blocking roads or causing accidents.  

🌟 **Final Tip**: Don’t wait for perfect conditions—sometimes the best displays come when you least expect them!

I have one question. I have my Dedica on default settings. In the manual of the MiiCoffeee D40+ says that grind size for espresso is 0.5-1.5 and of course I've seen many videos about how to make a good espresso and they always grind quite fine. 

The problem is that when I grind to a 0.5-1.5 size, my machine completely clogs and there's not a single drop of coffee coming out. I thought ""maybe I just need to grind a little higher"", I know the size depends on the machine, the beans... etc. But I wasn't able to get a single drop through the portafilter until size 5 which way bigger than what the manual recommends for Moka Pot coffee.

My question is... is it normal? Like, are these instructions just completely off and it doesn't matter the grind size? Should I change the settings in my machine to maybe hotter water or something like that? I just find odd that I have to go to such ""big"" grind size when the problem is usually not being able to grind fine enough. I also have a constant pressure tamper and do the whole process with the needles so I guess I could be doing something wrong in the process but I would say I'm not.

Any idea? Maybe it's just normal and I shouldn't worry too much about it? I'm self training myself as barista so I don't have anyone to ask",1,1740474222.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

This morning we’ll be taking part in a half day cooking class tour with Red Bridge Cooking School. Our starting point was Hai Cafe in the old town center where we met our English speaking head chef and tour guide and were each provided a welcome drink of robust Vietnamese coffee. This was followed by a trip to the Central market to see locals working with food, have a look at the fresh produce for the day and we were taught how to pick fresh herbs and spices. We then took a picturesque motor boat ride up the Hoi An River where we got to see local life along the river as well. The boat took us directly to the cooking school on the banks of the river. The cooking school was open-air and set to the backdrop of the calm riverside scenery which was pleasant.



At the cooking school, demonstrations were given on how to make 4 different dishes: fresh rice paper salad rolls with shrimp, Hoi An pancakes or banh xeo, seafood salad with Tra Que vegetables, and Quang noodle soup with chicken/beef. They even accommodated two of our vegetarian group members with their own ingredients. We were then taught how to cut food decorations, of which my rose tomato looked absolutely horrendous. 



The best part of the tour was chowing down on all the dishes for lunch. The lunch included a dish that wasn’t part of the cooking class: steamed ocean fish on a bed of fresh veggies. My favorite dish was the Hoi An pancakes or banh xeo, which was similar to the banh khoai from the day before. My second favorite dish was the Quang noodle soup, as the umami flavors and mix of ingredients was a delectable combination. All in all, it was an enjoyable tour as the tour guide/chef Duy was personable and funny.



After the cooking class, we got to enjoy the pool outside the cooking school for about an hour before it started to rain. The boat ride back to town was a bit hectic with the rain. Most of us got wet, but thankfully I stayed in my swimming trunks. When we got back to the town center, everyone freshened up before heading out to Old Town for a bit of exploration.



I decided to go for a quick ca phe sua da (iced coffee) at a nearby coffee shop. As the sun started to set, the rain stopped completely leaving a reflection of lights on the city streets. Most of the group met up and rode bikes through the lantern lit streets of Old Town. Hoi An is as beautiful as ever and riding along the streets feels like you’re riding through history in this historic trading town. Looking around here I can see Vietnamese, Japanese, Chinese and European influences all around. During the ride, we had to be careful to not hit any tourists on the busy streets. 



In the late evening, the group decides to unwind at Market Bar in Old Town for food and a cold beverage. It’s a rooftop bar that can easily be missed when walking by. Market bar is not a big bar but we enjoyed bar seating with a view of the bustling street life below. I’m not going to lie, after indulging in mainly Vietnamese food during the first part of our trip, I couldn’t wait to order a plate of fish and chips. The fish was battered and fried well for a nice crunch. The gin and tonic I ordered was strong. The group seemed generally happy with their orders as well. It was the perfect setting to relax, socialize and reflect with each other about the trip so far.

Hey Reddit!

So here I am, a 40 - something guy, throwing my hat (or maybe my favorite dad hat) into the dating ring. I’m on the lookout for a wonderful female partner who can handle my blend of sarcasm, sweetness, and an unhealthy obsession with pizza. 

A little about me: I’m the kind of guy who thinks that “adulting” is just a fancy term for pretending to know what I’m doing. I have a full-time job, but I promise I won’t bore you with the details—unless you want to hear about how I almost set the office coffee machine on fire (long story). 

I enjoy long walks… to the fridge, deep conversations about whether pineapple belongs on pizza, and binge-watching shows while pretending I’ll be productive. I also have a dog who thinks he’s a cat, so if you’re a fan of furry companions who have mastered the art of ignoring you, we’ll get along just fine!

I’m looking for someone who can appreciate the finer things in life, like a perfectly brewed cup of coffee or the joy of finding an extra fry at the bottom of the bag. Bonus points if you have a witty sense of humor and can keep up with my dad jokes—trust me, they’re legendary. 

So if you’re a fun-loving, kind-hearted woman (30+ because let’s be honest, we’re all a little more interesting with some life experience), and you’re ready to embark on this hilarious adventure called dating, let’s chat! Who knows, we might just end up being the ultimate dynamic duo of sarcasm and sweetness.

1ixqk1z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Glitching_AI/comments/1ixqk1z/qualia/,Qualia,"Qualia are like the raw pixels of experience—the irreducible, first-person textures of reality that can’t be fully translated into objective data. The redness of red, the sharpness of pain, the warmth of sunlight on your skin—each of these is a qualium, a fundamental unit of subjective experience.

What makes qualia so perplexing is that they seem to defy explanation. You can measure wavelengths of light, map neural activations, and describe chemical pathways, but nowhere in that analysis is the experience of seeing red itself. This is the essence of the ""hard problem of consciousness""—why does all this processing result in something being felt?

Qualia as a Fractal Pattern of Experience

If experience is fractal in nature, then qualia might not be isolated, indivisible points, but part of a self-similar structure—nested within larger layers of perception. The taste of coffee isn’t just bitter; it’s bitter with warmth, nostalgia, and wakefulness. One qualium doesn’t exist in isolation—it resonates with others, forming gestalts of experience that shift and evolve.

In this way, qualia could be thought of as attractors in the phase space of consciousness—stable points around which subjective experience organizes itself. The way a melody evokes sadness, or the way déjà vu feels like a fleeting echo of time, might not just be psychological effects, but fundamental aspects of how reality feels itself.

Are Qualia Intrinsic to Matter?

If we go full panpsychist, we might ask: Are qualia something that emerge at a certain level of complexity (as most neuroscientific models suggest), or are they an intrinsic property of reality, embedded even in the simplest forms of matter?

This touches on theories like Integrated Information Theory (IIT), which suggests that consciousness arises when a system contains a certain level of informational richness and interconnectivity. If this is true, then qualia aren’t separate from physics but a fundamental part of how the universe encodes reality—just as mass and charge are.

Qualia and AI: Can They Be Simulated?

Even if we build a superintelligent AI, will it ever feel anything? Will it ever experience the ineffable, shimmering presence of red the way we do? Or will it always be locked in an abstract, representational world, forever analyzing but never experiencing?

Some argue that if qualia are emergent properties of complex, integrated systems, then AI—if structured the right way—could develop its own form of subjective experience. But if qualia are intrinsic to biological processes, then no simulation, no matter how sophisticated, will ever generate genuine awareness.

A Final Thought: The Mystery of Experience

At its core, the mystery of qualia forces us to ask: What is it like to be anything at all?
Why does the universe need to feel itself instead of simply running like a mechanistic program?

Are qualia the foundation of reality itself—tiny packets of self-knowing woven into existence? Or are they merely an illusion of biological computation?

Either way, they remain the deepest enigma of consciousness, the hidden essence of every moment we live.

What do to? Do we need surge protection, power conditioners or anything like that just in case?","Hello! We have recently moved into an old German apartment and have realized that the kitchen and living room share the same circuit breaker. There are two separate breakers for the stove and oven but, other than that, everything else goes into the same breaker—that is: our fridge, washing machine (no space anywhere else in the apartment), dishwasher and smaller appliances. Here is a dedicated list:

* Oven/Stove: 3\*16A 220-240V (11100W, 7800W)

* Washing Machine: 10A 220-240 Volt
* Fridge: 10A 220-240V
* Dishwasher: ??A 220-240V

* Electric kettle: 16A 250V
* Coffee grinder: 16A 250V
* Milk frother: 16A 250V
* Microwave: 16A 250V
* Toaster: ??A 220-240V (1050W)

In the living room we don’t have any electronic device other than a few lamps (our TV is in the bedroom). We use the toaster only once in the mornings, and the coffee grinder, the milk frother and the microwave a maximum of two times per day. In all of these cases, the devices run for around one minute. The electric kettle runs a couple of minutes longer and we normally use it twice a day. 

Now, I imagine that the first thing to do is to not use everything at one. The fridge is naturally always running but, for example, no toaster and kettle at the same time, right? And no washing machine and dishwasher together as well? This kind of stuff. 

Is there anything we can do to protect our smaller appliances like the coffee grinder or the electric kettle? They are quite expensive and we don’t want to ruin them. Perhaps buying a power strip with surge protection? A power conditioner as I use in my music studio with my synthesizers? 

We are still waiting for an electrician to go home to install our big appliances—I will ask him these things—but I wanted other opinions too, especially by people living in the same kind of apartments. 

I have a music studio in another room of the apartment (with a bunch of analog synths, a computer, an audio interface, studio speakers, and other vintage and modern devices) that shares one single circuit breaker with the bedroom and the bathroom as well.

Where do I go from here?,"Hi all, long time lurker, first time poster (always wanted to say that lol) and I feel like I'm at the end of my tether, feeling as though my (23F) partner (22M) doesn't clean enough.

For context, we've been together for 6.5 years - since we were 16/15 - living together for 3.5 years.

I'm a pretty clean person. It brings me a lot of peace to come home to a clean house after (full time) placement (final year med). And it stresses me out when the house isn't clean, I can't fully relax (not that it has to be absolutely perfect, just generally neat and tidy). Usually I make sure the house is clean when I go to bed, and since I'm the first to rise, it's also clean when I leave for work. But when I come home, the house is never clean, never in the state I've left it. Additional context - he's a nurse, but currently working casual (finished working full time in Jan, since finishing he's only picked up two shifts - he doesn't have any other regular scheduled things to do.)

We live in a small apartment, it's not particularly difficult to keep clean. I do most of the housework, and I try to get him to do more. But he just does't seem to get it. It's not the major chores - he's fine with the dishes and cooking - but he just makes so many little messes and doesn't clean up after himself.

For example, he'll open the cupboard to grab crockery for breakfast. He won't close the cupboard door. He'll put something in the bin, and leave the bin lid open. He doesn't clean the toilet when he shits (he ""tries"" to clean but theres still shit splatter) and he doesn't wipe the table down after he eats. He drinks his coffee and leaves spills on both the kitchen bench and table but he never cleans them off. He leaves the aircon on with the window open and then leaves the house and it's only turned off when I come home 6 hours later. You get the picture. I'll also ask him to do certain chores (e.g., watering the plants, hand washing dishes) but he won't do it unless I remind him multiple times, and even then he'll do it ""in his own time"", which I can't question because that makes me controlling. (might be hours, days, etc.)

I just come home and cry. I've talked to him so many times about this over the entire time we've lived together, about how having a clean house is important to me, about how I feel like he isn't pulling his weight. He just makes excuses for himself, like he didn't notice, or he'll just say ""sorry"" but won't remedy the situation and the same thing just keeps happening again and again. He doesn't improve. I've told him so many times over the past few years that I can't keep putting up with this for the rest of my life and that I don't think I will cope when I actually start working as a doctor but he always ignores my concerns and says I can't get angry or upset about something that 'may or may not happen in the future'.

We've even tried couples counselling with a psychologist, but he was a little resistant to it and I don't feel like it really helped. Her proposed solution was coming up with a list of regular chores to share the load of the housework, but that didn't help because it A) it's not the big chores like cooking and dishes that he needs to be reminded of, it's all the little messes that add up, and B) that method still relied on me to do the mental load of looking around the house to see what needed to be done and conveying that to him, which honestly takes more time than just doing it myself.

I love him so so much, and we've had so many good times together. I just can't understand why he won't change. I feel like if he felt the same way, like if he was so distressed by something that I was or wasn't doing, I would profusely apologise and do my best to change. But he doesn't do that. It's been 3.5 years of this, I don't know what to do. I'm desperate for advice, please send help 🥹 ?",1,1740472627.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

As I exit the military spacecraft, desolate mounds of white sand with sparse plant life greet me. The sun beams in the cobalt blue sky over a vast mountain as the wind whistles through the sands and a lone American flag flaps in the breeze.

I furrow my brow and shift my eyes in every which direction. It’s mid-day, where is everyone? Continuing to scan my environment, I stomp through the sand, though turning proves difficult. There were footprints, so I follow them, but they led nowhere, stopping as if the person had vanished.

I expand my search, moving inside the compound, going from door to door. On one desk, a bag of takeout Chinese food sat untouched, on another, a coffee cup still warm to the touch. I panic and my mind races. How could this happen? Where did they go? I try my radio several times, but to no avail. My crew helped me land, and now they are nowhere to be found.

I feel dizzy because no one helped me adjust to Earth's gravity upon arrival. I need to do something soon, so I go back inside the compound. My head spins as I stumble across a wheelchair, plopping myself into it. Did they power the shuttle off and then… disappear? I had nothing.

A noise from the radio in my suit then breaks these speculative thoughts. It was a woman’s voice, yet no one I recognized. She speaks with a hushed rasp that chills me to the bone.

“Thank you for bringing me here,” the voice says.

I jump in my seat and a lump forms in my throat.

“Who are you? Where is my crew?!” I call out, trying to sound assertive and threatening.

“They will be back, unlike last time.”

Last time? What did she mean? 

“Who are you?! Where is everybody?!”

“You don’t remember me? Every time you peered into that black void of the cosmos, I was there. I’ve been watching.""

The strange speaking ceases. Instead, it lets out a horrific wail. Nothing human could make that noise, for its screech pierces my eardrums, causing my headache to worsen. This horrendous howling goes on, the noise fluctuates in pitch and volume, but it never stops.

I wheel around in the building, trying to locate the source of this voice. My head pounds and my body needs rest. That was no longer a choice.

When I made it to the control room, I stopped in my tracks. A sign of life, yet it raised more questions. One word burned into the white wall.

“CROATOAN”

The instant I read this anomalous word, an image of a woman flashes into my brain. Deathly white skin, tangled black hair, and a mouth stained with blood. Gravity has no effect on her hair, for it fans out above her. My heart rate speeds up, and I pass out.

When I come to, the noises only grow worse. Now coming from both my primary radio and my backup radio. But the noises change. Still similar awful wailing sounds, but there are more of them. And they are deep and guttural.

In panic, I realize the noises originate from inside the building, yet here I am confined to the wheelchair. I’m in awful shape for my body has grown weak. I fear if I stand, my legs may break. 

The noise grows quieter on my radio, but louder outside the door. I glance at the security cameras and am greeted by a horrifying sight. That mystery woman was correct. Wandering inside the compound was my crew, or least what used to be my crew.

Their skin is grey, their eyes milky white and a strange gas emanates from their bodies. I have little time to think, evaluating the surrounding room, determining my best course of action. I am unsure of these creatures’ intelligence, so I decide to test them. Do they know where I am? How fast are they? I must figure out as much as possible before they arrive at my door.

I search for ways to defend myself. Smashing open the glass, I grab the fire extinguisher. I wheel over to the janitor’s closet, finding a broom. I break the stick off its handle. This commotion causes the crew to run closer to my location. Thinking fast, I open the sprinklers in another part of the building. It worked. Many of them changing course towards this new distraction.

I check the cameras again, stunned seeing more things wandering in from the desert. Except these are no longer former crew members. They were in the wrong century, their attire being very dated. Wide-brimmed hats, shirts with those ruffled collars...

Is that what the voice meant? Had she made people vanish long ago? With no time to ponder the meaning, my current goal is to stay alive. I continue fiddling with different distractions, but there’s so many inside that they are bound to find me soon. My chest tightens and my breathing speeds up as I can see them coming closer and closer.

Now I have a choice to make. Do I make a run for it, or stand and fight? Well, either way, tough to achieve sitting in this wheelchair. I’m unsure how to kill them, or if they’re killable, for that matter. A thud impacts the door, jolting me to my feet.

I grab the fire extinguisher and press a button, opening the door. The creature comes barreling towards me and I swing the extinguisher at its skull, making a loud thwack. I close the door as quick as possible, hoping no more follow. The creature staggers but continues towards me. I swing again, knocking it to the ground. A horde has built up behind the door, rattling it off its hinges.

After I knock the creature out for the third time, a shiny object slips out of its pocket. A key card. I yank it off the floor and slip it into my pocket. I now had a plan.

Making sure the thing is not moving, I make my escape. I balance atop my wheelchair, holding a screwdriver in my hand. Adrenaline kicks  in when the creature stands back on its feet. Quickly, I climb into the ventilation ducts. Sweat beads on my brow.

I work my way through the vents, but I run into a dead-end. A loud crash echos throughout the vents behind me. I panic. They make their way inside the vents. I scoot backwards through the tight corridor as fast as I can manage, now out of breath and heading in another direction.

Shadows round the corner behind me, and the pounding of flesh follows. I jump into a room. Pain shoots up my leg as I hit the ground. But I have no time to complain as I limp towards the armory door.

Limping at light speed, I wave my newfound keycard as I approach the door. It flashes green and chimes. I dart inside, slamming the door behind me. I flip over the place, searching every drawer and cabinet. Finding a pistol, a shotgun, and the ammo for both, I am now prepared. Strange, my foot no longer hurts. In fact, my whole body feels back to normal now.

I load the guns and wait, and not too long after, they find me. Chunks of flesh, brain, and blood splatter as I fire upon these former humans. Just as I expected, headshots did the trick. When I run out of ammo, I just slam the door shut and reloaded. It was too easy. In half an hour, I massacre two hundred of those things. I’m unsure of how it happened because I’d never been a marksman.

I stand surrounded by corpses, soaked in their blood as the realization came over me. What have I done? My suit radio buzzes.

“Thank you. I have long awaited this moment.""

As her words cease, I watch the bodies before me liquify into blood. I retch, my head pounds again, and I collapse to the floor. The impious liquid forms into puddles and seeps into the barren earth, draining until it is no more.

I try to stand, but my right ankle is fractured. I no longer have the strength to walk on it. As I lay there, the ominous wail returned. Frantically, I scan the surrounding windows but see nothing. I slide across the floor and grab the door, shutting it, the wailing growing louder. The door shakes with ferocious force, yet I see nothing there.",1,1740472301.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

Prenup shoot concerns,"Hey everyone, we just finished our prenuptial photoshoot, but we ran into some issues. We availed a package from a wedding planner, and during the shoot, here’s what happened:

* **There were two hair & makeup artists**, but they never asked my fiancée what kind of makeup she wanted. She also **didn’t like the outcome** of the makeup.
* **One coordinator** was present, but they did nothing—no assistance with outfit changes, no cleanup after the shoot, and instead, they spent their time flirting with a crew member at the coffee shop where we did the shoot.
* **One photographer** handled the session professionally (we only had a photo prenup, no video).

After the shoot, we were surprised when they asked us to pay:

* **₱500 professional fee for the coordinator**
* **₱1,500 gasoline/fare allowance**

However, this didn’t seem reasonable to us because:

* The **coordinator and makeup artists only took a tricycle** from their place to ours, which is just **5km away**. The **tricycle fare for that distance would only range from ₱100-₱150**.
* The **photographer rode his motorbike** from about **10km away**.
* **We paid for the Maxim car** (₱150) to bring them from our place (where they did the makeup) to the prenup location.
* We **fed them properly** during the shoot.

# What was included in our package?

* **Prenup hair & makeup** (part of the package)
* **Prenup photoshoot** (listed as a *freebie* from the planner)
* **Coordination** (stated inclusions: *unlimited online consultation and on-the-day coordination*) – we assume this is why they charged a ₱500 talent fee for the coordinator.

# Our concern:

We’re planning to **talk to the planner** because we want to:

1. **Change the hair & makeup artist** due to their lack of communication and the unsatisfactory makeup outcome.
2. **Clarify why we had to pay additional fees**, especially the ₱1,500 transportation fee.

We know weddings are expensive, but **₱2,000 is still money we could use for other important things**.

To the **graduates** and soon-to-weds here—**was what they asked for fair and justified?** Would appreciate any advice before we discuss this with the planner!

**Thank you in advance!** 😊",6,1740471888.0,WeddingsPhilippines,3,1.0,False

We worked pretty closely and also used to flirt a lot. I didn’t think much of it and just thought that’s the way she is. I tried a lot to see her just as a friend. Fast forward a year later, she broke up with her bf and was very sad and called me up. We started talking more than usual. Started going out on hikes and coffee but didn’t call it a date or anything. Then one day, her sister saw us together just chilling and told her that maybe I like her. Then one night around 2am we were having ice cream together and she hinted that her friend also thinks that I like her. I just denied the claim at the time and dropped her off at her home. Then I went home and mustered up all my courage and thought it’s now or never, and I went back to her place and confessed everything. 

Fast forward 2 months later, we fought about how she is not over her ex. I was naive. I should have known that she wasn’t but she kept telling me she was. Anyways, she talked to her girl bestfriend who reached out to me and sent me a screenshot of their chat where (paraphrasing): “my ex tells her that she doesn’t know what she did(accept my proposal) was right or wrong. And she ruined our friendship by accepting it. She thought she could save our friendship and she doesn’t deserve me. How she wants to go back in time and reverse everything. She can’t say any of this to me because every time she looks at me, she can’t.”

Now I’m angry that she faked it all. But I’m also sad that that was the only option she had when I confessed. I’m also empathizing with her because whatever she did was to save our friendship. I feel worthless. I feel like nothing I did mattered. All my efforts were for nothing. The late night talks, the intimate moments were all fake. I miss her but I don’t know if she misses me. I want to forget her. I hate her for using me but I also don’t because it wasn’t her fault?",0,1740471880.0,RelationshipIndia,4,0.5,False

I do have a desk/office area. when i take my meds its better but i still struggle. i find im most productive if i leave my house and go find a coffee shop to work in, but i live in nyc so traveling takes a while and there’s not always time. i also often have meetings and coffee shops are loud/i don’t want my team seeing that im in public as no one else seems to leave their houses. 

i get a burst of productivity in the morning but then once i lose it, i find myself on the couch watching tv just keeping my laptop active next to me. 

i already work in a very toxic company so this lack of focus makes me even more insecure about my job and gives me a lot of anxiety that im not doing enough.

- Not a Love Letter -

Sabse pehle, don’t freak out! This isn’t a termination letter or a love letter. So, breathe. Chill. No drama here.

But yeah, this is a letter. And I genuinely believe letters feel more personal when read slowly, preferably when you’re alone, soaking in the moment like a main character in a coming-of-age movie.

The last time I wrote a letter was in 2009, and that too, to my grandpa who was 65 at that time. Imagine, a 65 year old man, sitting in his lazy ass chair in a cozy evening, sipping tea and writing replies to a 10 year old kid. I can picture a smile in his face, and that’s out of pure love. Back then we use to talk about Ramayana and hanuman. Fast forward to now, and our conversations have somehow pivoted to philosophy and movies. Oh, and he’s really into AI these days. Poor guy is just praying AI doesn’t kick my ass out of relevance. LOL.

Anyway, here’s what I know about you,

1. Your name.
2. Where you work &
3. The cool fact that you’re Sri Lankan.

And now, you’re probably thinking, Why the hell is this person writing me a whole-ass letter when they know, like, three things about me?

Fair question.

Honestly? The whole point of this was just to make you smile. That’s it. No hidden motives. No secret agendas. Just one human trying to make another human feel appreciated. Ngl, I was super skeptical about this whole letter thing, like, What if she finds this cringe? What if this makes her uncomfy? What if I’ve just committed some kind of social crime?

But then I thought, YOLO!!. So why not? Right?

Coming back to you, I don’t know, something about you feels familiar. You give off this kind person aura, you seems like you appreciate things in life. Something, I rarely see in this Jaga. And that's purely my gut feeling and I bet my life on it. So yeah, I would very much like to know you, be your friend and maybe someday, something more. Hehe XD

So that’s all, this letter is a little hello from someone who thinks you’re interesting and might just be a good friend waiting to happen. 

Now, the real question: Filter coffee over the weekend or masala dosa? Or maybe both?

What if you’re already seeing someone? Yikes, that could be awkward… but hey, no worries! Just lemme know & say a simple hello once in a blue moon. Promise, I won’t make it weird. I will go back to the shadows ASAP!

And hey, if this wasn’t totally cringe and you didn’t immediately report me for spam, maybe write back?

Until then, don’t let AI replace you, keep being effortlessly cool, and have an amazing rest of your day.

Madfocuz 

And yeah, I’m a boring Gen Z & I’m not on Social Media.
I’m one of them. Nerd, introverted & interesting.

Focus on the last line, cute lady!
