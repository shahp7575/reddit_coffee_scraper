1hq2dpv,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1hq2dpv/i_made_a_huge_mistake_at_work/,I made a huge mistake at work,"I work as a ground maintenance employee for my city park's department. It's a chill job of repairing irrigation and cleaning up trash. One of the parks that I manage is in a not-so-nice area. It's a popular spot for the homeless to hang around and they'll try to camp out there at night. It's a fairly big-sized park so most homeless people get away with being able to sleep in there. An assortment of homeless individuals come around often; some are troublemakers and some are calm. I've got into arguments and have had to call the police department on some for doing drug and making a huge mess. It's not that I have a problem with them and I think that as a society we should do more for them but regardless some of them bring dirty needles and crack pipes. There's one in particular that assaults the homeless woman who I'm pretty sure is in jail right now. Now when I'm cleaning up litter, I'm extra careful when picking these things up, the last thing I want to hear is about someone's child or dog or whatever picking up something and accidentally overdosing or catching something. Today, I fucked up to the point that I teared up driving home after work. I pulled over and just took a big sigh. I was disappointed with myself. There's a homeless guy who I'll call Jason. Justin is a pretty nice guy, he doesn't cause trouble and doesn't leave trash everywhere. Yesterday, I was doing my routine check and I came across this stash of stuff. It was a mattress, sleeping bag, clothes, glasses, food, and a coffee maker with water in it. I left it alone seeing as most homeless eventually take their things and leave. So fast forward to today, it's still there. I left it alone again and went around my park asking people if they knew who it belonged to and if they could ask whoever it was if they could take it with them since I like to have my park free of clutter. I still got no answer so I left it alone hoping that whoever it was would take it eventually. Throughout my shift, I got a call from my supervisor who found the stuff as well. He told me that it looked abandoned and to toss it. I drove back to the spot and picked up everything. I went back to the park's shop and tossed everything away. Since we threw away a lot of garbage out city dump tosses out our stuff pretty much twice a day excluding holidays. So in the last 30 minutes of my shift, I go back to the shop to put away everything and Justin is waiting outside the shop. He explained to me that it was his stuff and if he could have it back. I said sure however the dump already took it away. I apologized to him and I was expecting him to be angry or sad but he wasn't. He apologized to me because I was the one to throw it away. My heart broke, this homeless individual wasn't upset at all and he apologized to me and I threw away all of his possessions. I fucked up so bad. I feel like a piece of shit and I'm so angry at myself. Out of all of the mistakes that I have made a work this is the biggest one and I can't stop beating myself up for it.

I'm looking for kind, helpful advice regarding this without any triggering comments please. It's still very raw as only happened this week. TW for ending of friendship

I (F 35) met up with a friend (F 32) of 9 years for a post-Xmas catch up. We've been meeting up for chats and coffees for a long time and I considered this person one of my closest friends. Being in my 30s, it can be hard to develop strong friendships so I cherished this one.

When we met this week, I was 15 minutes late. I sent her a text to tell her I was sorry I was going to be late and would be there very soon. I have a physical disability alongside ADHD & autism which she knows about. Because of my physical disability I move slower and because of my neurological disabilities, I sometimes struggle to time-keep. This isn't the first time I'd been late to meet her, but I always text and let her know.

When I arrived, my friend looked visually angry. The first thing she said was 'why are you late?', I replied and said 'are you upset?' and she said 'yes'. I said 'I'm so sorry, I was running really late because of my back' she repeated 'why are you late though?' I said 'I'm sorry, are you ok?' her: 'I'm able to be here for 12.55pm so why aren't you?' Her face was stern and she was being incredibly cold, unlike her usual self. She then said her frustration was due to me being late a few times before.

This was when I started to cry, as I know it's my disabilities which now make it much harder for me to get from A to B. I explained this again to her and repeated that I was very sorry. She responded 'My time is precious and I need to honour my own truth' - To be honest, I don't personally find this type of language very considerate of people's individual circumstances but I listened and responded that I always appreciated her time as a friend and my being late wasn't reflective of how much I care about her but reflective of my difficulties with my disabilities.

I asked if she wanted to forget about meeting today and go home, we both agreed to go home. I was sobbing in tears. I felt like I'd been bullied and treated very unkindly by my friend. Her approach was confrontational and deeply upsetting.

The next day, I decided to text her to say I was really affected by what had happened, I felt a friend of so many years would've understood and empathised (she is also disabled and bipolar but not physical disability) and that I was there to listen. She sent me a one text which said:

'I no longer want to be friends with you or text. I no longer want to meet you one to one. As you know, my mental health has been not good over the years and I have to prioritise myself. You are a wonderful, creative, brave person and I hope you're able to fill my friendship gap with someone else'

I'd just to like say, we have had absolutely no arguments in the 9 years we've been friends, we've always had a really healthy and honest friendship where we would bring up anything which we found difficult or wanted to address. Her last text response to me was a mature one, but it was very hurtful and deeply confusing. I think she's going through a mental health crisis but I also just don't fully understand.

I've respected and not texted back, and won't ofc text back. I've also removed her from my social media.

What would you make of this if it happened to you by a friend? Was this the best way she could've done this? I feel slightly gaslit too.

I know I don't have any right to know but clarity might help me heal from this. Thanks.",2,1735605539.0,lostafriend,1,1.0,False
1hq29hu,https://www.reddit.com/r/LesbianActually/comments/1hq29hu/crushing_on_my_married_boss_a_workplace_mess/,Crushing on my married boss: a workplace mess. ,"Where do I starrrttttt ~~~?

I'll just start off by saying I'm no home wrecker. I'm extra careful about this and am aware of the consequences. I know. I just need to talk about it..

I'm (26F) crushing on my (35F) married boss, and I think she knows it. 

She's extremely intelligent so no matter how hard I tried to hide it, I could see in her eyes that innate knowledge and wisdom. Like, ""girl you're not fooling anyone"". 

Her husband (boss nr 2) recently decided to set up his office in our department. Great. Amazing. 

I can tell he absolutely loves his wife, but who wouldn't ? Words can't describe just how perfect she is. And the way he burns holes into my skull every time I chat with her around the office. It's like he can sense something is off lmao. And boy,  he ain't wrong. Something's definitely off. 

I like to think of myself as someone realistic, rational.. Not delusional. Right ? I'm not losing my mind and making up delulu shit, right ? Well..

Let me begin with the begining. She and her husband bought 70% of the company 1 year after I was hired, and installed themselves into the office completely forgetting to mention that they're now owning this whole damn place ?? I was basically polyvalent, I knew how to handle my job perfectly and replace coworkers during vacations and whatnot. I was happy and confident with myself at work. Until one day.. I saw her walk in, with a bright smile and curious eyes, and perfect skin with a subtle blush on her cheeks, and shoulder-lenght hair, and a calm aura with this feminine confidence and she was visibly so in control of her own life. I instantly hated her. 

She never introduced herself as ""The Boss"". I don't think she found it necessary to do so. I actually found out weeks later. Well, the problem is that I thought she's a newbie, hired to replace me because I'm an idiot. Long story short, on her first day at work, I was a snarky lil bitch to her. She kindly asked me questions about how things are going in my department, to which I responded coldly. Then, she asked me sweetly if I could show her how some accounting documents are handled in the office, to which I replied: ""I'm not telling you anything about that."". 

To think that I was not fired on the spot is still mind-blowing to me. The next morning, when she passed by my desk, she greeted me with a bright, sincere smile.. 

Days passed by, and I slowly began to understand that she must occupy an important position in the hierarchy. She had meetings with powerful clients and members of the company, and her word was basically law to my superiors. I was mentally preparing myself to getting fired. Strangely enough, her office was next to mine. She wanted to work among us, get to know her employees and see how we organise our tasks. Looking back, I can't help but feel even more infatuated with this woman's way of conducting herself and her business. She's ethereal. 

Days turned into weeks. Weeks turned to months. During this whole time, we didn't talk much, but we exchanged a lot about work related stuff. I would find her trying, and failing, to recharge the printing machine and I'd help her out. Or the coffee machine, or the stapler. It was oddly refreshing to exchange with her for these insignificant things. And she was kinda cute when she was struggling with all that. Other times, we would cross paths in the narrow hallway, and I would courtly step aside, making way for her to pass me by, like a servant would do so for their Queen. I could see her amused smile from the corner of my eye. 

We became very, very close, one blessed day.. 

When I had a clash with a dude at work. It was a messy argument, we were being mental, like dogs barking at each other. Still, I wrote and signed up my letter of resignation and quickly gave it to my boss, and went back to my desk to finish up for the day. Fuck that. I wasn't going to take any more of that dude's sarcastic bullying. 
While I was wrapping things up, my boss approached me like one would approach a wounded puppy and asked me softly if I would like to come talk to her in her office. I obliged. 

After a long discussion and a lot of stubborness from my part, she called out my name and said ""If anyone in this office should quit, it's him. Not you. I can't lose you over this."" And I fell in love. 

....

From that moment and ever since, I became a shameless mess for her. I showered her in small gifts and sweets and attentions and she accepted every time with so much kindness and grace. 

I stepped up my fashion game, button ups, pro suits, long dresses, cleavage, body lotion, seductive hairstyle. Took extra care of myself and even wore sexy underwear at work, not actually showing it to anyone - of course. Just, you know, when she would come to lean on my desk right next to me to ""discuss"", and her gracious hand would lightly graze over her upper leg before settling there: dangerously close to her weakness. The gesture, unassuming yet intimate, would drive me crazy. And when she would glance down at me, she would notice the subtlety of my lacey bra under the unbuttoned area of my flowery shirt. 

Regardless, I tried so hard to hide my raging infatuation and desire for her. My heart would betray me, my hands would tremble, my tongue would twist in my mouth whilst talking, I was scared to even look at her anymore..Scared that my eyes would tell her things. I tried to act cool but somehow ended up acting cold and distant. 

I found pleasure in working overtime every chance I could get since it meant that I would be alone with her in the office for at least 2 hours~ 
My heart flutters when I think of it, because, we would do anything but work during those 2 wonderful hours. I cursed myself for it, but she was always free to leave, yet she didn't. 

I sometimes noticed her blushing around me. When I would go check up on her in her office, I would lean my body over something to relax and playfully exchange with her, and she would smile and blush and twist some hair around her finger, glancing at me in a hypnotizing manner. I don't want to sound crazy, but I think she liked me back. Notably, right in front of her husband and another coworker, she leaned her body over a tall furniture, hands under her chin, her bright smile complimented her red cheeks and her pupils dilated in the daylight: looking at me lovingly. When we locked eyes, I saw that look be replaced with a look of surprise and fear, before walking off with a stoic expression. 

....

When people began to notice our chemistry, things went south. She took extra caution to work away from me, but she kept me around and protected me from afar. People would come tell me that they've heard great things about me from her. The distance hurt me so much but she was my guardian angel and continues to be, even if she's not coming to the office anymore. She's still running the business, so, that's the happy ending I guess. 

... 

I'll be surprised to see anyone reading all of the above.. if you've read this far, thank you.

This decision, though controversial and unprecedented, was the result of growing pressure from African American organizations and the Pan-African movement, which viewed Ethiopia as a symbol of resistance against European colonialism. 

Let's follow this adventure through the despatches of an Afro American 
Female journalist, Who was present in Ethiopia in 1936 for an Afro American newspapers.

**The Emperor of Destiny: A Portrait of Ethiopia and its Lion of Judah**
by Evelyn Wright
The Chicago Defender, Special Edition, March 1936

The setting sun filters through the ancient stained glass windows of the Imperial Palace in Addis Ababa, casting a halo around the figure of Emperor Haile Selassie I. Of modest stature but magnetic presence, the Lion of Judah— as his subjects call him—receives me in his private study, a space that blends traditional Ethiopian elements with touches of European modernity.

""Miss Wright,"" he says in perfect English, with a slight accent that betrays his French education, ""you come from a young nation. Here, you are walking on the land of Solomon and the Queen of Sheba.""

The Emperor wears a European-style military uniform, decorated with the insignia of the ancient Solomonic dynasty. His dark, penetrating, and melancholic eyes seem to carry the weight of three thousand years of history.

The Man Behind the Crown

""My real name is Tafari Makonnen,"" he confides, absentmindedly stroking his pet lion resting at his feet. ""Haile Selassie—Power of the Trinity—is the name I took upon ascending the throne. A name that carries immense responsibility.""

At forty-four, Haile Selassie embodies the paradox of modern Ethiopia: a progressive monarch in an ancient empire, a reformer bound by tradition, an African who engages with European powers as equals.

""Your volunteers,"" he says, gazing out the window toward the training field, ""understand what many Europeans do not: this is not just a war for Ethiopia. It is a battle for the dignity of all black peoples.""

Eternal Ethiopia

To help our readers understand this ancestral land, the Emperor takes me on a journey through the history and culture of his country.

""Ethiopia has never been colonized,"" he proudly emphasizes. ""When your ancestors were being torn from Africa, our empire was already minting coins, had a written literature, and a Christian church dating back to the 4th century.""

He shows me ancient manuscripts in Ge'ez, the Ethiopian liturgical language, illuminated with vibrant colors. ""Every Ethiopian child,"" he explains, ""grows up with the stories of King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba, the epic of King Lalibela who built churches in the living rock, and the deeds of Emperor Menelik II, who defeated the Italians at Adwa in 1896.""

A Complex Society

""Our society,"" the Emperor continues as we walk through the palace gardens, ""is a mosaic of peoples, languages, and religions. Amhara, Oromo, Tigray, Coptic Christians, Muslims, Falasha Jews—all are children of Ethiopia.""

For our African American readers, he describes a social system different from that of America: ""Here, discrimination is not based on skin color, but on social standing. I abolished slavery in 1924, I am building modern schools, and I have sent young people to study at the best universities in Europe and America.""

The Imminent Threat

His face darkens as we discuss the imminent Italian invasion. ""Mussolini thinks we are barbarians,"" he says bitterly. ""But who is the barbarian? The one who wants to conquer or the one who wants to live in peace?""

He rises and walks toward a large map of Ethiopia on the wall. ""Look,"" he points to the northern mountains, ""here, our ancestors have resisted for millennia. But now..."" his voice cracks slightly, ""now we face weapons that know no honor: gas, airplanes bombing hospitals, tanks against horsemen.""

A Message for Black America

Before I leave, the Emperor has a specific message for the readers of the Chicago Defender:

""Tell your readers that when they look at Ethiopia, they do not see just a distant country. They see living proof that black peoples have built great civilizations, that they can govern themselves with wisdom, and that dignity is not a monopoly of Europe.""

He pauses, then adds with intensity: ""Your volunteers here are not just defending Ethiopia. They are defending a principle: that there is a brotherhood that transcends oceans, that the fight for freedom is universal.""

Final Reflections

As I leave the palace, the sun has set over Addis Ababa. In the streets, merchants close their shops, Coptic priests hurry toward ancient churches, and muezzins call to prayer. This is Ethiopia: a land where the past and present dance an ancient choreography, where tradition and progress seek a delicate balance.

The Emperor I met today is not just the ruler of an ancient empire. He is the guardian of a dream: that Africa can be modern without losing its soul, that black peoples can be proud of their history while looking toward the future.

As the clouds of war gather over this ancient land, Haile Selassie’s words resonate as both a warning and a hope: ""Ethiopia has always won because her cause is just. Today, we fight not only for ourselves, but for all those who believe in freedom.""


**Eternal Ethiopia: A Journey into the Heart of Free Africa**
by Evelyn Wright
The Chicago Defender, Special Edition, April 1936

The Land of Contrasts

The dawn over Addis Ababa reveals a city of contrasts. From the windows of my hotel, I watch a procession of Coptic priests in ancient embroidered robes pass by young students in Western clothing heading to the modern schools established by the emperor. Fiat cars—ironically Italian—speed past caravans of camels laden with coffee from the highlands of Sidamo.

""Here, time flows differently,"" explains Ras Imru, the emperor's cousin and one of the kingdom's most powerful nobles. ""We live simultaneously in 1936 according to your calendar and in 1928 according to ours. We are in the twentieth century but follow traditions that are three thousand years old.""

Daily Life

At the Merkato market, the largest in Africa, I immerse myself in Ethiopian daily life. Women wrapped in traditional white netsela sell spices and incense next to merchants offering European radios. The air is filled with the aroma of roasted coffee—the birthplace of the precious plant.

""Every coffee ceremony is a social ritual,"" explains Woizero (Lady) Yeshimebet, a noblewoman who invited me to her home. For three hours, I observe the intricate ritual: roasting the green beans, grinding them in a mortar, and serving three different infusions in small porcelain cups called cini.

""Coffee is not just a drink,"" she says with a smile, ""it is the fabric that binds our society. In humble homes or noble palaces, the ceremony is the same as it has been for centuries.""

A Stratified Society

For our readers familiar only with American racial segregation, Ethiopian social structure appears surprisingly different. Dr. Malaku Bayen, educated at Howard University and now an advisor to the emperor, helps me understand it.

""Here, society is organized in a feudal manner,"" he explains. ""We have the nobles—the Ras, the Dejazmach, the Fitawrari—then the warriors, the priests, the merchants, and the farmers. The color of your skin does not determine your status. A noble from Tigray can be as light as an Italian, a noble from Sidamo as dark as any African American—both have the same rank.""

Education: A Bridge Between Past and Future

I visit the Menelik II School, the crown jewel of the emperor's reforms. Young Ethiopians study French and English, mathematics and science, but also their ancient language, Ge'ez, and the history of the Solomonic dynasty.

""The emperor wants us to be modern without forgetting who we are,"" says the headmaster, educated at the Sorbonne. ""Our students read Shakespeare and Victor Hugo, but also our ancient epic poems like the Kebra Nagast.""

The Church: Guardian of Tradition

The Ethiopian Orthodox Church is the beating heart of the nation. In Lalibela, where medieval churches were carved into the living rock, I attend a ceremony that seems to come directly from the time of the biblical kings.

""Our church has preserved Christianity in its oldest form,"" explains Abuna Yohannes. ""When your ancestors were brought to America, our churches were already a thousand years old. We have preserved manuscripts that Europe lost centuries ago.""

The Art of War and Peace

At the training camp, I observe young warriors practicing Gugs, the traditional Ethiopian martial art. They move with the grace of dancers, but their sticks strike with the force of clubs.

""Every Ethiopian man is a warrior,"" explains Fitawrari (commander of the vanguard) Desta. ""But we are also poets, musicians, artisans. Our warrior tradition serves to protect our culture, not to destroy that of others.""

Ethiopian Women

Ethiopian women defy Western stereotypes about Africa. Empress Menen personally runs schools for girls. Noble warriors like Woizero Senedu command troops in battle.

""Our women have always held power,"" explains Princess Tenagnework, the emperor's daughter. ""Empress Taitu commanded the army at Adwa. Our queens have ruled empires.""

A Message of Hope

As I conclude this journey into deep Ethiopia, I cannot help but think of what this nation represents for us African Americans. Here, we see a black people who have never known colonial slavery, who have preserved their culture and dignity through the millennia.

Ethiopia shows us what Africa could have been without European colonialism. Its ancient traditions, its complex social structure, its proud independence are a living testament to the greatness of African civilization.

Now, as the drums of war grow louder, this ancient nation prepares to defend not only its independence but a universal principle: that freedom is an inalienable right of all peoples.

As an old priest in the mountains of Tigray told me: ""Ethiopia is more than a nation. It is a promise that God made to Africa. And a divine promise cannot be broken by bombs or tanks.""

**The Lion Remembers: The Battle of Adwa in the Eyes of Those Who Were There**
by Evelyn Wright
The Chicago Defender, 1936

The old Fitawrari Wolde Tekle sits in his traditional hut on the heights of Adwa, his gnarled hands wrapped around an ancient Remington rifle. At ninety-two, his eyes are still as alive as fire when he speaks of that day that changed history.

""I was a young warrior in the imperial guard,"" he begins, his deep voice resonating in the quiet of dusk. ""I was eighteen, and I was with Ras Makonnen's troops, the father of our current emperor. That night, the night before the battle, no one slept.""

The Night Before

""Scouts kept running between our positions. 'The Italians are moving,' they whispered. 'Baratieri has taken the bait.' Emperor Menelik had made them believe our forces were retreating, but in reality, we had surrounded the mountains like a leopard surrounding its prey.""

He rises, surprisingly agile despite his age, and leads me outside. The sun is setting over the same mountains from forty years ago.

""Look at those three peaks. Amba Semayata, Amba Garima, Amba Abba. We call them the Three Sisters. That night, one hundred thousand Ethiopian warriors hid among those folds, as silent as death. We had Remington and Berdan rifles, Hotchkiss cannons hidden under straw blankets. We were not the savages the Italians thought us to be.""

The Dawn of Destiny

""At dawn, the fog covered everything. We could hear the sound of Italian troops moving below us, divided into three columns. We could hear their officers cursing in Italian as they lost contact between units.""

The old warrior's eyes light up. ""Empress Taitu was with us, splendid in her battle dress. 'Today,' she said, 'God will judge who has the right to this land.'""

The Trap Springs

""When the fog began to lift, we saw the Albertone brigade isolated in front of us. They were like lost sheep among wolves. The first Ethiopian cannon shot was the signal. From every height, from every hidden valley, the Ethiopian army surged onto the enemy.""

Wolde mimics the positions on the ground with sticks and stones.

""Here, the Dabormida brigade was trying to reach Albertone. Here, Arimondi was trying to maintain contact. But we knew every stone, every path. Our warriors swarmed through the rocks like locusts, appearing and disappearing.""

The Fury of Ethiopia

""It wasn’t a battle,"" he says with pride, ""it was a storm. The Italians had fifty-six cannons, we had forty. But ours were in better positions, each piece placed where it could do the most damage.""

He stops, gathering a handful of red earth.

""This land drank much blood that day. The Albertone brigade was the first to collapse. Then Dabormida found itself surrounded in the Valley of Death. Our riflemen pressed them from every side, while the lancers waited for the right moment.""

The Decisive Moment

""By noon, I saw something I will never forget. Emperor Menelik, high on his white horse, gave the signal for the final assault. Eighty-two thousand rifles and eighteen thousand spears moved as one. The roar of the Ethiopian warriors made the mountains tremble.""

His voice lowers to a whisper.

""The Italian battalions broke like dry twigs. We chased them for miles. We captured all their flags, all their cannons. Even their general fled, leaving his men behind.""

The Price of Glory

""But victory has a price, my daughter,"" he says, looking toward the memorial where the fallen rest. ""We lost four thousand brave souls that day. The Italians and their askaris lost more than seven thousand. I saw Italian officers crying as they surrendered, I saw Eritrean askaris throw down their weapons and beg for mercy from their African brothers.""

The Legacy

He stands up, straight as a young warrior.

""Today, I see your young people from America training on our mountains. They have the same fire in their eyes that we had at Adwa. But war has changed. The Italians no longer come to fight as men, face to face. They send flying machines to spit death from above, they use gas that burns the flesh.""

He takes his old Remington.

""This rifle helped save Ethiopia in 1896. Today, it takes more than gunpowder and courage. But remember this: at Adwa, we didn’t win just because we had more men or because we knew the mountains. We won because we fought for our land, for our freedom. And that,"" he concludes with a proud smile, ""that will never change.""

**Brothers of Africa: African American Volunteers in Ethiopia's Struggle**
*by Evelyn Wright, Addis Ababa, April 1936*

The sun sets over Addis Ababa, painting the walls of the ancient imperial palace gold, as I sit writing these lines for my brothers and sisters in America. After weeks of traveling across three continents, I finally arrived in the capital of the last independent African nation, now threatened by fascist aggression.

The first African American volunteers arrived last week, after a daring journey through Sudan. Some crossed the ocean to London, others passed through Cairo. John Robinson, a black aviator from Mississippi, even flew his plane across half of Africa to reach Ethiopia. I saw them get off the dusty trucks, tired but with their eyes shining with determination.

Welcoming them were several Ethiopian dignitaries, including the Dejazmach Beru Wolde Gabriel, an aristocrat who studied in England and speaks perfect English. “Welcome to the land of your ancestors,” he told the volunteers. “Here we will fight together for the freedom of Africa.”

The training began immediately. Ethiopian officers, many of them veterans of previous wars against the Italians, began to instruct volunteers in the use of the weapons supplied to the imperial army. I observed the exercises: German-made Mauser rifles are the standard infantry weapon, along with a few Lewis machine guns. The Ethiopians also have some mountain guns and Hotchkiss heavy machine guns, but the equipment is limited compared to the modern Italian war machine.

But what is most striking is the bond that is being created between the American volunteers and their Ethiopian brothers. During training breaks, they sit together under the eucalyptus trees, sharing coffee roasted in the traditional Ethiopian way. Our kids learn some words in Amharic, while the Ethiopians are curious about the life of African Americans in the United States. ""It's like we've known each other forever,"" William Robinson, a volunteer from Harlem, told me.

This morning, however, the brutal reality of modern warfare shattered the capital's peace. Italian planes appeared in the sky like steel vultures. Bombs rained down on the western neighborhood, hitting the Red Cross hospital. I ran through the rubble together with the rescuers. The scene was heartbreaking: women, children, elderly people lay among the ruins. The acrid smell of smoke mixed with the cries of the wounded.

An Ethiopian doctor, his white coat stained with blood, looked at me with eyes full of pain: ""Do you see what they do? They bomb a hospital full of civilians. Is this what they call civilization?""

The African-American volunteers immediately suspended training to help in the rescue effort. I saw them digging through the rubble with their bare hands, carrying the wounded, comforting the survivors. ""Now we understand even better why we are here,"" one of them told me as he wiped sweat from his dust-blackened forehead. ""This is not just Ethiopia's struggle. It is the struggle of all free peoples against oppression.""

As I write these lines, the warning sirens are once again ringing over the city. But neither the Ethiopians nor our brave volunteers show signs of fear. The determination in their eyes is stronger than ever. Ethiopia will not be alone in this fight for freedom.

**Blood on Amba: The Last Stand
**
by Evelyn Wright, Amba Aradam, February 1936*

The sun had not yet risen when the first mortar shot pierced the silence of the Amba .... The mountain trembled. Then came the second blow. And the third. And all hell broke loose.

The Ethiopian positions were dug into the black rock. Trenches one meter deep, reinforced with eucalyptus trunks and bags of earth. American volunteers occupied the central sector, together with the elite troops of the Dejazmach Desta. Four thousand men against a complete Italian division.

“Here they come,” Freeman said, pointing his binoculars toward the valley. The first wave of Eritrean askaris advanced in orderly lines. Their bayonets glittered in the first light of dawn.

The Dejazmach Desta raised his binoculars. ""Three battalions,"" he said. ""And behind... yes, the Italian light tanks."" He turned to Colonel Hubert. ""It's time to welcome our guests.""

The Hotchkiss machine guns opened fire first. Their sharp, metallic noise echoed among the rocks. I saw the first row of askari fall like marionettes with cut strings. But others took their place. They still advanced.

""Fire at will!"" The cry ricocheted down the line. The Ethiopian Mausers and the American Winchesters began to sing their death song. The air filled with bullets.

A young Ethiopian warrior next to me was charging and shooting, charging and shooting. His hands moved as if in an ancient dance. ""My father was in Adua,"" he said without stopping shooting. ""Today Italians will learn again.""

The askari reached the base of Amba. They began to rise. The Italian mortars pounded harder, trying to break our defenses. Shards of rock flew everywhere. The air smelled of cordite and blood.

It was then that the Dejazmach Desta gave the order. ""Counter attack!"" His scream went through the line like lightning. 

Two thousand Ethiopian warriors rose from the trenches. The American volunteers with them. I saw them charge down the slope, rifles in hand, bayonets shining. Their war cry was the thunder following the lightning.

Freeman led a group of volunteers. His Winchester spit death. Three askari fell in front of him. A fourth pointed his rifle at him. Freeman kicked him, then stuck his bayonet in his chest.

The fighting became close. Brutal. The bayonets went for the meat. Rifle butts crashed into helmets. The Ethiopians also used their shotels, traditional curved swords. The blades cut through air and flesh with equal ease.

I saw a volunteer from Chicago, a former boxer, knock down two askari with his bare hands. A young Ethiopian warrior beheaded an Italian officer with a single shotel blow. Blood sprayed into the air like red rain.

For a moment, it looked as if the Italian attack was flagging. The askari began to fall back. The light tanks stopped, uncertain.

That's when we heard them. The deep roar of Fiat engines. The Goats materialized in the sky like steel vultures.

""Planes!"" The warning came too late.

The first bombs were conventional. They exploded through the ranks of the counterattackers, opening craters in the black rock. I saw men flying through the air like rag dolls.

Then came the mustard gas. The bombs fell silently, almost gracefully. They opened like poisonous flowers, releasing clouds of yellow-green death.

The gas hit the Ethiopian troops like an invisible scythe. The men began to cough. Then to suffocate. Their lungs filled with fluid. His eyes burned like live coals.

""Backwards!"" Hubert shouted. ""Everyone back!"" But it was too late for many.

Freeman pushed his gas mask into my hands. ""She must live,"" he said. ""You have to tell."" Then he turned and ran towards a group of trapped Ethiopian warriors. I saw him hand out the few masks he had. Then the gas engulfed him.

Dejazmach Desta refused to retreat. I last saw him on the crest of Amba, surrounded by his officers. Everyone stood, swords in hand, as the gas slithered around them like a yellow snake. They died like ancient warriors, face to face with the enemy.

The retreat was a nightmare of men running, falling, getting up again. The gas followed us, sliding between the rocks like a living thing. Behind us, Amba Aradam had become a mountain of the dead.

That night, from the makeshift relief camps, we looked at the mountain. The last rays of the sun dyed her blood red. The Italians had won, but the price was honor.

The American survivors gathered around a fire. Of their eighty men, only twenty-seven were still breathing. They cleaned their weapons in silence, as if that gesture could also cleanse their souls of what they had seen.

An old Ethiopian warrior approached the fire. His voice was hoarse from the gas, but he was singing an ancient war song. The words spoke of fallen heroes and future vengeance. One by one, the survivors joined in the singing.

Dawn found the Amba ... silent and terrible in her majesty. The wind still carried the sweet smell of mustard gas. But it also carried the silent oath of the survivors: the war was not over. And the blood shed that day cried out for revenge.

Some thoughts around the past year…

# The stats 

Male / 39 / 5’10” 

SW: 238 / CW: 193 / GW: 175-180 / 

% weight loss: 19%

LDL cholesterol reduction: 207 to 73

6-month Waist Size: (only measured for 6mo) 3.6in reduction

6-month Abdomen Size; (only measured for 6mo): 5.7in reduction 

Neck: 17.5 to 14.5

Clothing sizes: XL to M / 38 to 34 pants 

Dosing: 2.5 (4.25mo) / 5 (1.75mo) / 7.5 (5.75mo) / 10 - current dose 

# My story 

Like many here, weight has always been a struggle in my life. I still have vivid memories of being 16, going to my pediatrician office for a self reported medical issue but hearing a convo with the nurse and doctor in the hallway (“… he made an appointment for X, but his mom really wants you to talk to him about his weight…”)

Never really did yo-yo diets though did get down to 185 working multiple times a week with trainer and eating a very eastern medicine diet (pretty much no carbs, all natural foods, most calories in AM and Lunch and absolute minimal food… like only carrots/celery for dinner) about 10yrs ago. Wasn’t a sustainable lifestyle. But body and bloodwork were all perfect and had never been healthier in my life. 

Kids… life… got up to 240. 

Recent discussions with doctors turned to cholesterol and reaching age 40 and needing to be on statins for the rest of my life… I knew if I lost the weight it’d probably be ok. We did genetic testing for cholesterol issues and the markers weren’t there… so I knew it’s the weight. 

Started on metformin for a few months. Lost 5-7lbs but it wrecked my GI and I was miserable. Hated taking pills twice a day and having to always remember and carry them with me. 

Enter GLP1s… 

My approach has always been slow and low. Quickly dropped a bunch of weight and then was around .5-1lb/week. Stayed long periods of time on each dose. Waited until food noise returned or weight loss stopped before moving up a dose. 

About half way through the year had to move to a weight loss clinic per my insurance. Got setup with a RN & nutritionist. Generally it’s been good to work with someone who knows in and outs of GLP1s… and am very grateful for good insurance that allowed me not to do a PA or challenge anything once i started with the clinic.

Overall- for the first time in my life I feel in control with food. I enjoy what I eat but it doesn’t drive who I am as a person. 

# Side effects 

Generally been pretty lucky. As I increased dose I noticed some small side effects that would resolve in a week or two. Constipation is the biggest one that I constantly work to keep on top of. 

I did have a random spout of upper left abdominal pain that persisted for a few days. Went to a walk-in who took an X-ray and noted nothing but some constipation. Went to a GI specialist and went for a CT and nothing was noted besides constipation  

Have felt some impacts of the dopamine loss - mostly for first month or two on each dose. Not depression, but just “blah” and loss of excitement with things… something I continue to work on. 

Recently with the move to 10 I’m wondering if I’m developing “silent reflux” as feel like my nose has been running for a month straight… 

# Supplements 

Regular user of collagen in my coffee every morning. who knows if it works, but I’ll believe the snake oil!

Also regularly use probiotic and digestive enzymes. Besides that… just a regular multi vitamin, but just sometimes (blood work really didn’t flag any deficiencies)

Started using some creatine but felt it led to some water weight (as expected) and was having a bigger psychological impact than I thought not seeing the scale move, so decided to wait until maintenance to continue. 

# Next steps 

Past 3-4mo my weight has generally stalled. Holidays, traveling I’m sure are impacting… but I’ve gone from wearing size large to size medium with no number change on the scale. So trying to keep that in perspective. 

Overall 1yr in and lost 19% of my body weight… and a way happier and healthier guy! 

Thanks for listening to my Ted talk!

(If it matters, I live in Wyoming, work in Colorado) 


I'm long winded, bear with me


So context: I have worked at a certain huge bookstore chain for just over a decade now. We of course also have cafes. One of our benefits is a free drink from the cafe once a day, it has to be a small black coffee or tea, and if you want anything added or anything different you have to pay for it. This benefit was introduced a couple years ago, and from the beginning, it's been very loosely enforced at leadt at our location, which is to say, even our cafe and store managers just let everyone get whatever drinks they wanted and ring them under the free basic drink. 


A couple months ago, our old store manager got another job, and our cafe manager got promoted, so we just got a new SM and cafe manager at the same time, and they are both very by-the-book people, so we all stopped pushing that rule. 


I do not get along with the new SM. She has less experience than almost anyone else in our store, and from day one, minute one, has been incredibly rude and condescending to our entire staff. Working here used to be a lot of fun, but now it's an absolute nightmare, to the point that nearly everyone is desperately searching for a new job. Anyway, the week before xmas, I got frustrated and called her out and told her she needs to stop being so condescending and actually listen to her staff and let us help her learn how this thing runs, instead of micromanaging our every move and slowing everything down. She obviously did not like that.

Lo and behold, today (I was off most of last week) I get called in to a meeting with her and the area manager (her boss) where they basically accused me of, and tried to get me to admit to, theft of cafe drinks, which they supposedly have evidence of via transaction records and security of me making my own drinks (they didn't show me any of this, but I'm sure its real). And then they suspended me for an indeterminate amount of time, with no pay. I asked how I'm supposed to defend myself when they hold all the cards, and they basically shrugged and just told me to leave and wait for them to contact me.

Now, this is technically a rule that I have broken, I didn't admit that to them, but I understand I've broken policy. The issue is, like I said before, we all did this, and we all stopped shortly after the new management moved in, and since no one else is being threatened with termination over it, and given the timeframe between my little outburst and this meeting, I can't help but feel singled out for being ""difficult"".

Is there even anything I can do? I don't want to throw everyone else under the bus by tattling that they all did the same thing. I did tell them that management at the time allowed it, but they basically just scolded me like a child telling me I should've known better. I don't have any kind of email or paper trail, I don't know how to prove I'm being singled out without screwing everyone else. Do I try to fight it? Do I just quit? In either case, is there any possible way for me to get unemployment? I've already been applying to jobs for like 3 months and no one will hired, I don't know what to do.

I'm having quite hard time keeping my cadence up for this faaaaast moving, quick-changing and extremely impersonal world, so therefore I've realized that apps are not my thing.. I can actually explain more about myself here. So yeah, let's give this another chance :))

I'd say I'm a funny, energetic, sarcastic, and yet chill, calm, and sometimes depressive type of guy (see. winter sadness lol ). I care about my looks, I know what I want from life, partner, work... I'm quite confident I'd say as much as one can be.. I have my matters in order. I know this sounds very disciplined and rigid but I have sooo much leeway for anything and everything.

I like to spend my time with loads of stuff like having a pint with friends every now and then, going to the gym 3 times a week, playing games (currenly playing POE 2 but also a fan of BF series), watching movies/series (drama,sci-fi,comedy you name it I love all and I'm a movie buff I'd say :D ), playing guitar, reading books, lying down on the rug watching the ceiling while listening to Pink Floyd... Idk there's loads of stuff :D

I enjoy deep chats quite a lot, philosophy, and endless banter especially no-holds-barred type of banters are fun... honestly any no-holds convo can turn into something funny :lol :D

I'd say I'm quite caring, protective, solution-oriented, open to communicate, and quite straightforward guy... but as you might've guessed already those just don't come from day one... feelings are feelings because we can't control them, right?  
Maybe we can walk in the parks holding hands talking about the movie we watched yesterday and about the characters? We can read poems to each other and maybe learn different things every other day and share them? We can prank each other, come up with weird jokes to see others reaction :D... all those lovely stuff... live in a wee village outskirts of a big bustling city but not in it and have late-night drives together? We can go for an ice cream at 3 am and settle for a terrible garage coffee LOL...

What I'm looking for?

I'd say someone who has her life in somewhat order, who's in touch with her emotions, who's honest or should I say blunt (in a nice way :D), who's loyal, and who's curious about things in life... who knows what she wants, someone who's giving, caring and good at communication. we don't want to play guess games right ?

I'd say I'm an ambivert so I like going out for gigs, stand-ups, pints with peeps, but also need my alone time and indoors time so I love to have a cozy nights in so would prefer someone who'd be okay with this kind of rhytm. But I should say I'm more leaning into spending time at home.

Things I think could be deal-breaker for some people:  
\- I'm Atheist. But I do respect religions as long as the respect is mutual and it's not your total personality.  
\- Got 4 tattoos.  
\- I'm Turkish originally. Apparently the least sophisticated thing about me is quite important for some.. so if you care about it there you go :))

Here's a burst of trivia of me:  
\- I looove watching movies and analysing them and movie-hunting is also a little exciting for me :D  
\- I play loads of different games so we can play some together ?  
\- I read some books and like to talk about them, if you wanna explain stuff from the stuff you read and/or documentaries you watched then let's go ? I'll be listening :D  
\- I'm a fooodieeee ... I'm sure we'll devour loads of foods together :D

\*\*A Burger Sunday\*\*  

\*Anonymous\*

To all my flavor-loving friends in Cushing, it’s that glorious time of the week—Burger Sunday! Prepare yourselves; it’s time to whip up something truly delicious. Today, I have affectionately named my creation ""Daniel,"" and it’s going to be a culinary adventure.

I usually start with the freshest meat I can find, so I’ll be grinding it myself. Once I have it ground to the perfect consistency, the next step is crucial: I’ll immerse this raw mixture in a bath of cool milk for two hours in the refrigerator. This soaking process not only tenderizes the meat but also infuses it with moisture.

After the two hours are up, I retrieve Daniel from his milky soak and begin the alchemy of flavor. I generously add minced garlic, a sprinkle of salt, freshly cracked black pepper, a hint of cayenne for heat, vibrant paprika for color, and a drizzle of rich olive oil. With careful hands, I mix everything until the spices are evenly distributed, then I return the seasoned meat back to the fridge, allowing it to rest and absorb those tantalizing flavors for several more hours.

After a rigorous five hours of yard work and cleaning—perfect for working up a hearty appetite—I’m ready to finish crafting my burger masterpiece. I pull Daniel out of the fridge, the aroma already teasing my senses, and divide the seasoned meat into four equal portions. With care, I shape each portion into a perfectly rounded patty, ready to sizzle.

Now, it’s time for the grill to work its magic. Each patty is placed onto the hot grates, where it begins to sear, creating a beautiful crust. It’s important to note that these burgers are never cooked rare; no matter the meat’s origin, they must be cooked thoroughly to ensure security. However, the careful seasoning and method I’ve used guarantee that they remain incredibly juicy and tender—even after thorough cooking. 

While the patties are grilling, I prepare my buns and any toppings of choice—perhaps fresh lettuce, ripe tomatoes, crisp pickles, and a dollop of creamy mayonnaise—everything to elevate the experience. 

Finally, the moment arrives to assemble the burgers. Once the patties are perfectly cooked through, I place them on the buns, ready to be devoured. The first bite is an explosion of flavor; the combination of the fragrant spices, the juiciness of the meat, and the freshness of the toppings come together in perfect harmony.

Daniel was nothing short of spectacular.

Thank you all for joining me on this savory journey; I hope you enjoy every bite!

\*\*

He could almost savor the vivid way the author painted Daniel's flavors; the descriptions were so rich and enticing that they made his mouth water in anticipation. Today’s recipe was nothing short of spectacular—a delightful array of flavors that seemed to leap off the page and dance in front of him. He felt an irresistible urge to try it out himself.

As he finished his steaming cup of coffee, the warmth still lingering in his hands, he found himself rereading the article for the third time, each word igniting his excitement further. With every line, he felt a deeper connection to try and he had a figure he had been observing from a distance for some time now. Until now, he hadn't even been sure what his name would be, but the author had effortlessly breathed life into that name, giving him a sense of familiarity and intrigue that beckoned him to get to work.

He briefly closed his eyes, visualizing the process ahead: a two-hour soak in cold milk followed by another three hours for the spices to infuse. The thought raced through his mind—he needed to acquire meat, and it had to be fresh; nothing less than freshly ground would do. A hint of determination washed over him. 

With a purposeful sigh, he folded the newspaper up neatly and tucked it into his back pocket. The morning air greeted him as he stepped out of the cozy coffee shop, the mingling aromas of roasted beans and baked goods lingering in his senses. He crossed the parking lot to his truck, jumping into the slightly worn seat. The clock on the dashboard read 8:30, and he knew Daniel was on the road, making his way to work.

He navigated through the familiar streets toward the alley behind Marcis Deli, a place quiet enough for his needs, yet close enough for a swift exit. Anticipation tingled in his fingertips as he plotted how to approach Daniel. Should he execute an ambush from the shadows? Opt for a casual request for a smoke? Or play innocent by pretending to have car trouble? Each scenario unfolded in his mind.

The engine of Daniel's car soon broke the morning stillness. His heart raced as he saw Daniel pull up. The man stepped out of his truck with purpose, moving a few feet toward Daniel, who was still fumbling with his keys. Clearing his throat to mask the adrenaline, he called out, “Hey! Sorry to bother you, son, but do you have any jumper cables?” The words hung in the air, deceptively casual, yet loaded with intent. He got closer to Daniel.

""Uh,"" Daniel stuttered, his voice barely above a whisper, he turned to the car and with a swift and brutal motion, the man swung a crowbar, striking Daniel squarely in the back of the neck. The impact was jarring; Daniel's body went limp and crumpled to the ground with a heavy thud.

Without hesitation the man rushed down grasping Daniel under the arms and hoisting him up as if he weighed nothing. He maneuvered the unconscious boy into the back of his truck.

The drive back to the farm was a brief fifteen minutes, yet it felt like an eternity as anticipation surged within him. Every shadow flickering past the window seemed to heighten his excitement, amplifying the possibilities of what lay ahead. Thoughts of Daniel filled his mind, each one more exhilarating than the last. 

As he drove down the familiar dirt path leading to his farm. The main house, a sturdy old structure with peeling paint and a weathered porch, was just a backdrop to the scene unfolding behind it. He steered his truck toward the far end of the property, where an old, retired slaughterhouse stood, its paint chipped and its windows dusty. This dilapidated building, once a bustling hub of activity, now served a different purpose; it had become his clandestine chop shop.

He parked the truck, the engine rumbling to a stop, and took a deep breath, steeling himself for what lay ahead. With firm hands, he lifted Daniel's unconscious form from the bed of the truck and carried him inside the dimly lit slaughterhouse. The air was thick with the scent of aged metal and dried blood, remnants of its former life. He gently laid Daniel on the sturdy, blood stained, chipped butchers block. 

 He had perfected the process over time, and now it took him only two hours to prepare a Daniel. He began with a meticulous full-body shave, ensuring every inch of skin was smooth and free of hair. After that, he gave Daniel a thorough wash, using warm water and non fragrant soap to cleanse and refresh. Once Daniel was clean, he carefully assessed each joint, methodically cutting around them and separating the limbs with precision. The entire operation was carried out with a practiced ease, showcasing his skill and attention to detail in every step. He'd debone the hands and feet and throw those to the side with the groin, those would all be blended together with other scraps for sausage later. 

Once the extra meat had been carefully sliced into manageable pieces, it was meticulously wrapped in plastic and sealed before being packed away into the freezer for future use. With the shop now quiet and the remnants of the butchering process tidied away, he pulled out the meat grinder, an old yet reliable tool that had seen countless cuts of meat transformed over the years. 

He set it up on the counter and began feeding the last of Daniel into the machine, the rhythmic grinding filling the air with an oddly satisfying sound. As the last bits of meat were ground up, he took a moment to appreciate the transformation, the texture becoming finer and more uniform. With the ground meat now ready, he shifted his focus to preparing the burgers.

He stepped away from the back property, the sun shining brightly overhead, sending warm rays cascading through the trees. The main house was in sight, and he felt a sense of relief as he realized he still had plenty of time left in the day to prepare the meat. Once inside the rustic kitchen, he retrieved a large bowl and poured milk into it, watching as the creamy liquid filled the vessel. He carefully mixed in the meat to marinade.

With the preparation underway, he slid off his sturdy leather boots, feeling the cool floor against his tired feet. The weight of the morning's work began to settle in his bones as he made his way to the bathroom for a long, hot shower. Standing under the steamy spray, he scrubbed vigorously, washing away the remnants of his labor—the stubborn blood from his hands—and focused on cleaning beneath his nails until they were raw yet refreshed. 

After his restorative shower, he changed into a clean set of clothes, the fresh fabric feeling invigorating against his skin. He stepped outside, drawn to the sound of the wind rustling through the trees as he approached the area of the fence that had been destroyed by a herd of elk just nights before. The sight of the downed fence urged him to roll up his sleeves and get to work, determined to restore its strength and integrity before the animals visited again.

Between mending the weathered sections of the fence and attending to the evening chores that awaited, he finally carved out a moment to return to the kitchen. With a determined focus, he set about draining the excess milk from the freshly butchered meat, carefully letting it flow away to ensure the perfect texture for his patties. Once satisfied, he turned his attention to seasoning, reaching for the minced garlic, which he added generously to infuse the meat with its aromatic essence.

He sprinkled in a precise measure of fine sea salt, followed by freshly cracked black pepper that released a bold fragrance as it hit the mixture. A touch of cayenne pepper was next, adding a subtle kick that would elevate the flavor profile. Finally, he reached for the vibrant paprika, its rich red hue promising warmth and depth to the blend. 

With all his ingredients assembled—spices, aromatic herbs like oregano and thyme, and various binders to hold everything together—he began the meticulous process of mixing. Each fold and knead of the meat was done with deliberate care, as he wanted to ensure the full array of flavors melded seamlessly together. He envisioned the juicy burgers that would soon take shape, their savory aroma filling the kitchen and making his mouth water in anticipation.

As he worked, the promise of a culinary triumph loomed ahead, invigorating the room with the thrill of creativity and the joy of preparing a meal that would surely become the highlight of the evening. The anticipation of cooking these lovingly crafted burgers was palpable, each bite destined to provide a satisfying and memorable culinary experience.

As the workday drew to a close, he eagerly prepared his coal grill for an evening of delicious burgers. He carefully arranged the charcoal, ensuring it was evenly spread and ready to ignite. Once the coals were glowing a bright orange, he reached for the beautifully seasoned patties, their savory aroma already tempting his senses. 

With a slow, deliberate motion, he placed each burger onto the grill, the sizzle resonating with a satisfying pop as they made contact with the hot grates. The rich, smoky scent wafted up, mingling with the lingering warmth of the afternoon sun, causing his anticipation to soar. A smile spread across his face as he admired the perfect placement of each burger, picturing the juicy, charred goodness that was about to emerge from the grill.

Once the burgers reached their perfect level of doneness, he turned his attention to the buns, toasting them lightly until they were golden brown and slightly crisp on the edges. He carefully arranged an array of toppings nearby to create the ultimate burger experience. Fresh, vibrant lettuce leaves were rinsed and dried, their crispness a refreshing contrast to the juicy patties. Ripe, succulent tomatoes were sliced into thick rounds, their bright red color promising a burst of flavor. He added crunchy pickles, their tanginess providing a delightful zing, and finished with a generous dollop of creamy mayonnaise, smooth and rich, to tie all the flavors together. With everything in place, he prepared to assemble his delicious creations, ensuring that each bite would be a perfect harmony of taste and texture.

Then that first bite. His mouth watered. Daniel was delicious.",1,1735604074.0,creativewriting,0,1.0,False
1hq1ph3,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticSpouses/comments/1hq1ph3/i_am_realising_my_husband_is_a_narc/,I am realising my husband is a narc. ,"My husband is always so annoyed by me being sick. He once abandoned me to go for a marathon when I was just out of hospital with hypertension at 23 weeks pregnant with our son. When I had hyperemesis with my daughter, he yelled at me that I was just choosing not to eat and drink.

The last 5-6 days I've been having chills and muscle aches and night sweats. Then two days ago I was hit like a mac truck with a full on fever and could barely get home from a restaurant with my kids. My daughter was so scared she had 911 dialed in the car. She then helped me into a bath and looked after her little brother for me as my husband was dealing with a car issue (which was fine and understandable). 

When he got home he took me to urgent care two nights ago with a 101.4 fever (and that was after it came down a bit) then basically ignored me unless people were watching. I was in agony and have been having chronic health issues and when I described them he shrugged to the doctor like this was all news to him, even though it isn't. He knows about all of it and has for years.

When I had an X Ray the tech got so annoyed because he stayed in her office to look at my results, taking pictures of my X ray like he was the fucking radiologist and finally said 'Mr, your wife needs help back to her bed' when I could barely stand up.

When a nurse said 'you have a raging fever' he was like 'it's not that high, my last fever was way higher'. The nurse looked at him like 'STFU'. 

The (male) doctor basically implied I'm just stressed with kids and work and instead of backing me up when I said 'it's not stress or anxiety, I'm not well' my husband didn't advocate for me, just told me I was being defensive. 

Usually when I'm sick I try and just push through because he is so miserable with me but yesterday and today I haven't been able to. So he's taken over with the kids and is doing everything and being Mr Housework even though he never helps with anything usually and it's almost like he's doing it to say 'see it's not hard I don't know what you're whining about'.

Yesterday, he literally disappeared to look at barbecues with his siblings today so my daughter called my parents (who he didn't tell I was sick) saying I wasn't in any shape to look after my toddler son if he woke up and they rushed over and he's angry at them for interfering. My parents have been nothing but supportive to him but he hates my father (who is very difficult and IMO has some narc traits at times) and I think he strongly dislikes that my parents can see how he treats me now we live in the same city.

Then he called me to talk about what to make for dinner and I missed it so he dropped in on Alexa and said he called 6x (it was 2, he constantly exaggerates like that) and to call him immediately. When I called him he got angry with me because the toddler was jumping on me and it hurt so I gasped then he hung up on me.

When I called back he said 'I didn't hang up on you, I hung up on the situation you created'. The situation being my child was nervous about looking after her 3 year old brother if he woke up because my husband had fucked off to look at barbecues with his siblings. I burst into tears and he told me I was being insane crying and he's fed up with my bullshit.

The bullshit in question is being not being able to manage the giant house he insisting on renting without any help, plus 20 hours of work a week, plus a 2 year old kid he refused to put into childcare until his mother basically demanded he do it, plus a high needs ADHD 10 year old, as well as chronic health issues of mine that we can't get answers on, the giant dog he insisted we buy but does not walk, train, or even bother to feed.

Since we married he has chosen deliberate incompetence at every turn, criticises me constantly (he literally told me two days ago that I was an 'addict' because I said I 'needed' a coffee), him deliberately undermining me in odd ways that have become more and more obvious over the years, and me finally reacting to all of it at which point he calls me abusive and scary for simply saying 'enough'.

He didn't ask me what I needed the entire day except once when he asked my daughter to ask. I'm so dehydrated and he literally could not care less. Last night I had spikes of fever again and drenched the bed with night sweats repeatedly. At some point I was having a nightmare and begging someone for help. He woke me up and said 'well, how can I help?'. I was groggy and didn't know and then I said I was feeling super faint and felt like I needed a little sugar and could he get me some juice. He sighed and I said don't worry about it and he went back to sleep.

I'm expecting him to tell me yet again after the kids have gone to bed that he doesn't know why he's with me when the house is a mess and I am a nightmare and a drama queen.

He is also super enmeshed with his siblings and mother in a way that I find really odd and they're almost boxing myself and my parents out more and more. It's really strange. Since they moved back to our city he has become more and more into spending time with them and nastier and nastier to me. Their father is a narcissist who was emotionally and financially abusive and controlling and I'm realising my husband has more in common with him than I realised.

TLDR; I'm really sick, my husband is being an asshole to me while making it look to the world like he's dad and husband of the year, and I'm so hurt. In many ways he's my favourite person in the world, but he's so horrible to me simply because he can be. 

And on a day when I feel like I'm dying and years of chronic health issues have honestly flattened me, I'm just sad that my best friend has so little empathy for me.

1hq1occ,https://i.redd.it/j7et4cect2ae1.jpeg,Does anyone else think the CEO shooting is a set-up to scapegoat leftists?,"(Sorry for the incoming rant)

I was originally in the camp of people that believed Luigi did it. But as more information comes out regarding the so-called evidence and the way the police handled this makes me lean more in the direction of this guy Luigi being a (poorly chosen) patsy to smear leftists and further criminalize communist/socialist activity across north amerikkka. Like I didn't know that when they arrested Luigi, they didn't take his fingerprints nor DNA sample, despite claiming his prints matched what was found around the crime scene.

The evidence ""discovered"" by the police all seem to point at someone with leftist beliefs (the anti-capitalist manifesto, the monopoly money found in an abandoned backpack), but you look at Luigi's social media accounts and you learn the guy was more centrist than anything else. He doesn't lean left or right, instead he follows Joe Rogan and AOC. He buys coffee at Starbucks and seems to love eating at McDonalds which is where he was arrested. Leftists know about the boycott. It's clear this is a random young man with no real motive that the police decided to pin the crime on. When Luigi was brought before a judge, he informed the court that the police planted evidence like the manifesto and gun on him. He chose to plead not guilty.

I personally believe a hitman was hired, likely by someone at UHC who wanted to get rid of Thompson and have him replaced. That's probably why the UHC meeting went on like nothing happened. Whoever it is has the NYPD at their beck and call. It would not surprise me if corrupt cop-turned-mayor Eric Adams was promised by someone in the ruling class that if he got the NYPD to help cover up this CEO murder, the criminal charges against him would somehow be dropped. ""You scratch my back, I'll scratch yours"" type of deal.

But I think they made a huge judgment error when they chose Luigi to be the fall guy. The ruling class probably thought only a minority of leftists would celebrate the murder of a CEO and everyone else would be outraged and want all the leftists to be locked up. They had no idea that nearly a third of the population, from both the left and right, would celebrate this CEO murder. Also, the more people coming forward to speak about Luigi, the more we find out that he's loved by roommates, friends, neighbors etc. Even his fellow inmates seem to love him. They were hoping they could smear him as a Ted Bundy/Kaczynski type of criminal mastermind and failed so hard. Now it looks like the CIA is involved because Hollywood is planning on releasing a true crime documentary about Luigi even though the trial hasn't happened yet and no verdict has been reached. They're trying SO HARD to cover this up and convince you into believing he's guilty.

Luigi has somehow become a poster boy for the left even though he's just some random guy dragged into something he likely never wanted to be a part of in the first place. But I think the real reason for his iconic status (even if it is unearned) is that the actions falsely attributed to him have caused some dormant people to wake up to the class struggle and become radicalized. And more people waking up to it has the ruling class scared. They fucked up big time and they know it.

They're claiming that anyone who celebrated the CEO murder is going on a ""terrorism watchlist"" and it's like lol good luck putting millions of us on your silly list 👍 I can guarantee you don't have enough manpower to catch us nor prisons to fit millions of us.",0,1735603854.0,TheDeprogram,4,0.5,False

Ever find yourself stuck between being a doormat and going full thunder mode when trying to express yourself? You're not alone. Here at Greenpoint Psychotherapy, we see lots of people struggling with this exact problem. Let's talk about how to speak up for yourself in a way that actually works.

# What's This ""Assertive Communication"" Thing, Anyway?

Think of it like this: if communication styles were porridge, passive communication would be too cold (staying quiet and letting people walk all over you), aggressive communication would be too hot (yelling and steamrolling others), and assertive communication would be just right. It's about saying what you need while still being decent to others. It's like learning to dance – you need to find the right balance between leading and following.

# How We Help People Get Better at This

# First Up: Figuring Out Your Current Style

Most people come to us either being too quiet (saying ""it's fine"" when it's definitely not fine) or too forceful (turning small disagreements into big arguments). Knowing which one you do is step one.

# Getting Real About Why You Communicate That Way

Maybe you avoid conflict because growing up, speaking up got you in trouble. Or maybe you get aggressive because you're scared of not being heard. We help you understand these patterns so you can change them.

# The Magic Formula

Here's a simple recipe we teach our clients: ""I feel \[how you're feeling\] when \[what happened\] because \[why it matters\]. I'd like \[what you want\].""

For example, instead of silently fuming or yelling about dirty dishes, try: ""I feel stressed when I come home to a sink full of dishes because I need a clean space to cook dinner. I'd like us to figure out a dish schedule that works for both of us.""

# Real Life Examples That Actually Worked

# At Work

One of our clients was drowning in work but kept saying yes to more projects. We helped her learn to say: ""Hey, my plate is super full right now with these three big projects. I can take this new one on, but I'll need help figuring out which deadlines can shift.""

# With Family

Another client was tired of his partner's Netflix-and-chill approach to housework. Instead of making passive aggressive comments, he learned to say: ""I'm feeling overwhelmed by handling most of the cleaning. Could we sit down and split up the chores in a way that feels fair to both of us?""

# Easy Tips to Try Today

1. Use ""I feel"" instead of ""you always"" or ""you never""
2. Look at people when you're talking (but no staring contests!)
3. Keep your voice steady (no whispers or shouts)
4. Pay attention to your body language (uncross those arms!)
5. Actually listen when others respond
6. Be kind to yourself when you mess up (because you will, and that's okay!)

# What's In It For You?

People who practice this stuff tell us they:

* Feel less anxious about speaking up
* Like themselves more
* Have better relationships
* Can say ""no"" without feeling guilty
* Have fewer arguments at home and work

# The Bottom Line

Getting better at speaking up for yourself is like learning to ride a bike – it takes practice, you'll wobble at first, and you might get a few scrapes along the way. But once you get it, it changes everything. Start small, maybe practice with your coffee order before tackling big conversations with your boss or mother-in-law. Every tiny step counts!

# Need Some Help?

If you're tired of either biting your tongue or biting people's heads off, we get it. Our team at Greenpoint Psychotherapy knows how to help you find that sweet spot in between. We've got real humans (who've been there too) ready to help you figure this stuff out.

1hq1lj0,https://www.reddit.com/r/LPR/comments/1hq1lj0/will_this_go_away_on_its_own/,Will this go away on its own?,"My original story with LPR can be found in my profile, but it has been about a month now since my symptoms first appeared (right after a concert I came home and suddenly my throat felt dry and had to get water, next day same thing happened and I hyperventilated while going on a walk outside, the rest is history...) and now I'm thinking to myself whether or not I have LPR. Like yes my throat gets difficult to swallow usually towards the end of my meal (not as bad as before, I can eat solid foods now just slowly), I have to eat first thing after I wake up or else I feel it is harder to eat the rest of the day, my stomach is constantly making gurgling noises (which is my only indicator that this may be an acid reflux issue), I have excessive saliva, mouth dryness, nasal drip, etc.

The thing is, maybe it's because I'm quite stubborn, but I don't think my issue is related to food. My diet isn't great, but it's also not bad. I notice my LPR symptoms don't respond to certain foods but it rather comes and goes on its own schedule, which was my indicator that this is not food/acid reflux related?

I'm debating whether I should get a H Pylori breath test done tomorrow (it sounds awful, fasting and everything) just to cross one thing off the list of potential causes, but if I'm being honest I feel like this is just another one of my body's random symptoms in response to stress, anxiety, my pre-existing stomach problems, excessive caffeine intake (I stopped drinking coffee for now which absolutely pains me because I love coffee), etc. But also, this problem itself has been causing me so much stress and anxiety and giving me bad sleep which is putting me in this endless cycle of misery. I don't take any medications because I react bad to them and I genuinely don't think the PPIs do my stomach any good, and I eat normal foods (chocolate, foods that are on everyone's do not eat list) and I feel fine, like yes I do get symptoms but it happens if I eat anything at this point so why be miserable and eat bland food? I also sleep flat because sleeping with a heightened pillow gives me bad shoulder pain, and I wake up in the morning feeling fine. Their are moments throughout my day where I feel normal again (probably because I'm distracted so the symptoms are less noticeable), and moments where I feel the symptoms back again. Anyone else experience this?

I'm not sure what my point was in this post but I want to know if anyone else shares these feelings and if they somehow just got through with this and their symptoms just went away on its own? I feel this is a temporary point in my life, and while I do see hundreds of people on here who have been experiencing this for years (which makes me feel terrible) I feel like personally this will go away by itself? I do eventually want to see a doctor but in my country seeing an ENT or Gastroenterologist takes months and I'm currently on the waitlist, and I feel like by the time I'm able to I'll be cured.",2,1735603643.0,LPR,3,1.0,False

The sorority house was alive with drunken chatter as the girls sprawled across the living room, glasses in hand, half-empty bottles of cheap wine littered on the coffee table. Music pulsed through the speakers, but it was mostly drowned out by the sound of high-pitched giggles and slurred conversations.
 
Lauren sat awkwardly on the couch, fiddling with her phone, her cheeks flushed from a mix of wine and a hint of embarrassment. She had just returned from a quick trip to the bathroom, where she’d caught a glimpse of herself in the mirror. And no, she wasn’t imagining it — the stubble was real. 
 
“You’re, like, *actually* wearing a bikini right now?” Maddie’s voice cut through the drunken haze, and Lauren immediately regretted everything. Maddie’s tone was laced with mock disbelief, as if she couldn’t comprehend the horror of what Lauren had done.
 
Lauren groaned and shifted uncomfortably. “It’s not that bad. I just didn’t get around to it this week, okay?”
 
Maddie snorted. “Lauren, babe, it’s a *bikini line,* not like, trimming the grass around your ankles.” She took a sip from her cup, clearly enjoying the chaos she was about to unleash. “It looks like a *cactus* down there.”
 
Sarah, always eager to pile on, chimed in, her words a little slurred but still cutting. “No, no, I saw it earlier when you bent over to get your bag — it’s like a jungle down there, girl. How are you even wearing that swimsuit without having a *brush fire* down there?”
 
Lauren could feel her cheeks burn, but she couldn’t stop the defensive words from slipping out. “I— *I* didn’t even notice it until I got home,” she muttered.
 
Emma, who had been silent until now, finally spoke, her voice dripping with drunken judgment. “Are we seriously pretending this is okay? Lauren, this isn’t like your armpits. This is *beach territory* we’re talking about. You can’t just leave the hairline untouched. Like, it’s *right there* for everyone to see.”
 
She giggled at her own words, but the rest of the girls didn't find it nearly as funny. They all exchanged knowing looks and burst into laughter, as if they were witnessing some kind of social sacrilege.
 
“I’m sorry, I’m sorry,” Sarah said, wiping a tear from her eye as she smirked at Lauren. “But like, have you looked at it from the *side* angle? I was *literally* waiting for a bushfire warning. It’s like... it’s like a *hedge* down there. So much foliage.”
 
“Yeah!” Maddie added, her voice high-pitched and mocking. “Like, I swear to God, it’s a *whole ecosystem* under there. I’m scared it’s going to start attracting bees or something. It’s like a *rainforest*.”
 
Lauren was ready to sink into the floor, but she refused to let them see how much they were getting to her. “It’s *not* that bad,” she said, her voice weaker than she meant it to be.
 
Emma, who was already half-drunk and fully committed to the roast, threw up her hands dramatically. “Girl, it’s like you’re *storing extra shelter down there* for the winter! Are you planning to keep a whole *family* of animals in there or what?”
 
The group erupted into giggles again, but this time, it was louder, meaner, and far more specific.
 
Lauren stared at her phone, pretending to scroll through Instagram, but the reality of the situation settled in — they were right. She hadn’t shaved her bikini line in weeks. It wasn’t just stubble. It was *bad.*
 
But before she could wallow any further, Maddie slurred, “No, seriously, Lauren, how do you even wear a bikini with that situation? I mean, I can’t even imagine. I wouldn’t let anyone within five feet of my *bikini zone* if it was like that.”
 
“Well, maybe I *like* the wild look,” Lauren muttered, trying to salvage some dignity.
 
The laughter was instantaneous. “You *like* it?” Sarah sputtered. “Girl, you look like you’re hiding a small forest down there. I’m waiting for *Bigfoot* to emerge!”
 
It was a cruel but hilarious moment. The girls cackled as if Lauren had just shared the funniest joke in the world, and she sat there, accepting it. The wine made it easier to laugh along, to pretend they weren’t making her feel like an absolute disaster. 
 
“Okay, okay,” Lauren said, raising her hands in mock surrender, “I get it. My bikini line is a tragedy. I’ll fix it. I swear. Just... stop. Please.”
 
===============
The night wore on, the drunken energy swirling around the room like a chaotic storm. The sorority girls, tipsy and emboldened by the wine, moved from one topic of conversation to the next — all in the spirit of late-night bonding, or so they told themselves. Lauren, still feeling the sting of the bikini line comments, sunk deeper into the couch, her arms crossed defensively. She had made the mistake of thinking the teasing would end. 
 
But no. Maddie, eyes sparkling with mischief, turned her attention back to Lauren.
 
“So, like,” Maddie began slowly, her voice dripping with playful judgment. “We were all talking about how you can’t even keep your bikini line under control… but, like, how have you *never* gotten a Brazilian?”
 
The room went quiet, all eyes shifting to Lauren, the laughter fading for just a moment, replaced by genuine curiosity mixed with derision.
 
“I… I mean, it’s just, like, not my thing,” Lauren said, her voice smaller than she wanted it to be. She picked at her nails, trying to avoid eye contact.
 
“Not your thing?” Sarah repeated with a laugh. “What do you mean, ‘not your thing’? Like, that’s something a *real woman* does.” She giggled, then took a long gulp of wine, eyes narrowing playfully. “You know, like, the ones who *really* care about *looking clean* down there. Not the ones who let it grow like a chia pet.”
 
Lauren’s face flushed again. “I’m not a *real woman*?” she asked, raising an eyebrow, though the bite in her voice was laced with more defensiveness than she intended.
 
Emma, always quick to jump on a juicy topic, leaned forward, resting her chin on her hand. “Girl, if you’re gonna call yourself a woman and wear bikinis, you gotta go the whole way. Like, how are you just… leaving it all there?”
 
“I *don’t* leave it all there,” Lauren retorted, but she knew her words were hollow. The teasing had already burrowed in deep.
 
“Oh my God,” Maddie practically shouted, clutching her sides. “Lauren, how have you made it this far in life without ever getting a Brazilian? You *can’t* call yourself a woman until you’ve been through the *torture* that is the first wax.”
 
There was a ripple of laughter around the room. The girls were getting louder, drunker, and more excited about the topic.
 
“Seriously,” Emma said, pushing her glass aside and settling into a cross-legged position on the floor. “Let me tell you about *my* first time. I was *so* naive. I went in, all confident, like, ‘I’ve done my eyebrows before. This will be fine.’”
 
She paused for dramatic effect, making sure she had everyone’s attention. “But the moment she pulled the first strip off? I screamed so loud that I swear to God, the whole street heard me. I thought I was gonna die right there on the table. And the worst part? It wasn’t even a good wax. I left with a patchy mess. Like, she totally missed a spot. I looked like I had a *half-eaten mango* down there.”
 
The room howled with laughter.
 
Maddie clutched her stomach, tears in her eyes from laughing so hard. “Oh my God, Emma, *you did not leave with a half-eaten mango.*”
 
“Trust me,” Emma said, wiping away a tear, “I did. It was a *traumatic* experience. But after that, I swore I’d never go back to shaving. I’m a *woman* now, I have standards.”
 
“Right?” Sarah said with a knowing nod, leaning back against the couch. “Once you get the Brazilian, you can never go back. The first time I went, I was, like, ‘What’s all the fuss about?’ I didn’t understand why everyone was so dramatic.”
 
“Yeah, because you were a *virgin* to the wax!” Maddie teased.
 
“Exactly,” Sarah continued, unfazed. “I thought it’d be like, oh, a little painful, no big deal. But then, when she pulled the first strip? I thought I was gonna *die.* My whole body jerked, and I, like, kicked her in the face.” She cackled, remembering. “It was so bad, she had to take a break to calm me down. But when I finally saw the results? I was *obsessed.* Like, everything was just… *smooth.* I was walking around like I was ready to go on *Vogue*.”
 
“Stop,” Lauren said, her voice flat but tinged with a slight laugh. “You guys are making it sound like I need to be tortured to be a ‘real woman.’”
 
“Oh, *you* don’t know what torture is, honey,” Maddie said, wagging her finger. “You can’t even say you’re a woman until you’ve had a wax. Like, it’s just *mandatory,* you know?”
 
Lauren shook her head, trying to laugh it off. “Fine, fine. I guess I’m just not ‘real’ enough to be part of the club.”
 
The girls exchanged a look of exaggerated pity, then burst into another round of laughter.
 
“I’m just saying,” Emma said, wiping the wine off her chin, “once you do it, you’ll *never* go back to shaving. You’ll feel like a goddess. But the first time is *brutal.* It’s not even the pain that gets you. It’s the fact that you're lying there, with your legs in the air, practically *giving birth* to your dignity.”
 
“That’s what makes it *so great,*” Sarah added with a sly grin. “You go in feeling like a complete wreck, and you come out with the smoothest *everything.* You can’t put a price on that.”
 
“Alright, alright,” Lauren said, throwing up her hands, giving in to the banter. “Maybe I’ll try it. But no promises about the whole ‘goddess’ thing. I’ll be screaming like a baby.”
 
“Oh, we *know*,” Maddie said, practically falling off the couch with laughter. “We’ll be there to watch the meltdown.”

I am the second oldest of 6 ranging from 20-3 Years old.To put it simply ever since I started to work at 16 my family has often come to me as a backup bank account whenever we go into a financial struggle.This specifically became a larger issue when my brother moved out at 18 causing me to take the new position of the oldest in the house.

My older brother doesn’t resent me nor my family but likes to be in complete control of his life without my families input.I don’t believe my family prevent asking him in a form of favoritism but he unlike me, doesn’t keep a job for long and he often doesn’t have a lot of money on him even when he got a job,so he’s not reliable in my families eyes.

Now regarding the payments themselves I have a payment plan where any cash that may come into my possession will STRICTLY go into my savings account which I’ll not be touched by me nor anyone else,and the money I have coming straight into my spending account is mine to spend leisurely.This added upon the fact I took a online year of school to save up for college/self development and plan to spend my last high school year in person was always transparent to my parents.

The problem comes when my job has been taking days off my schedule leaving me to have dwindling pay checks every week,which open my eyes again to how much my mother and stepdad dip into my spending account.For example when my ch do family came in as $400 spending in less than a month my spending had been pulled down to 87(if I had taken up all their requests I would have 0 by now) and only at most I spent on myself truly was barely $100 for stuff like replenishing my favorite coffee,wax beads,or buying a subscription for myself,while before my paycheck I initially had $40 I was saving for myself

That may seem small but there have been times I’ve saved almost $1,000 dollars after being laid off my last job and as I waited for a new job it became less than 100 after a few months while majority of the payments weren’t even mine causing me to willing freeze my card from my family and for repayments they would either be short,never come,but consistently never go back into the account they bought from.

My mother decided to put me into public school this year behind my back to have more time with my baby siblings so she could be basically alone at home

And for a better idea what they come to me to spend is 

-Rent(while being a minor)
-Car Repairs(I don’t drive and never was a fault for damages)
-Christmas Gifts
-Every Uber Drive/Gas(My 17 Yr old brother works with me)
-Groceries
-Deposits
-My mothers accounts automatically using my card for months 
-17yr brother demands(He likes carrying cash money so he only pays me back in cash so it goes into my savings)

And that’s just all I remember,if I calculate all I lost I may get a headache but I know it’s in the thousands I just want to know how to be listened to or if I’m overreacting",2,1735603465.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

1hq1gnd,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmITheJerk/comments/1hq1gnd/aitj_for_snapping_at_my_partner_while_having_a/,AITJ for snapping at my partner while having a hormonal imbalance ,"For context, I started taking Diane-35 in Jan 2024 but stopped after 3 months as I noticed some changes in my face. I have always had clear skin so when I started breaking out, I was really stressed and anxious so I recently started taking Diane-35 again and I'm still on my first pack. 

I've noticed that I've been very easily irritable and I just didn't think to communicate what I was going through with my partner because I myself am trying to figure myself out. My partner has never been the type of person to check in on me to see how I'm doing because apparently men don't do that sh*t. The way I think is that sometimes, we don't even think about telling them something unless prompted to do so. For more context, my partner works a full-time job and I have not been working but will start working full time in a couple of months. I pay the same amount of rent all just the same as he. I tend to the house and take care of the dishes, laundry, cat, etc. My partner vacuums and takes out the trash. 

Now onto the issue: Last night at 1am, I was very sleepy and told my partner I'm going to bed. We had dinner while watching TV on the couch so there was a paper bag with rubbish by the couch and a dirty plate on the coffee table. I walked into the room and he started getting ready to come to bed. I was already so sleepy but I still had to put the rubbish and dishes away and because of my frustration from his lack of effort to help me, I snapped and got mad. Normally, I am very aware of myself and try not to have any outbursts because he is the type of person to take it personally and does not think he could've done anything better. Because of my hormonal imbalance, I snapped and his excuse was he didn't see the dirty dish and rubbish. I find that really crazy because it was right in front of us the entire 3 hours and he's saying he didnt notice it. 

He then got mad because of my reaction and argued with me telling me not to use my hormones as an excuse when he has never tried to understand my perspective. Might I add, when I was going to have my surgery for polyps and fibroid removal, it was my first surgery and I was really scared but he decided to argue with me the night before my surgery and he wasn't even there with me despite only being 2 hours away. He decided he could not cancel his plans with his friends just for me. He argued that the argument last night could've been avoided if i controlled my reaction but I simply couldn't because it just slipped. I didn't do it intentionally but it happened and it slipped. The way I think is that the argument could've been avoided if he cared enough to know what I was going through but apparently the way I think is wrong. The amount of opportunities he could've used to ask me why I was recently irritable instead of saying he thinks I am bipolar just makes me even more upset. He also strongly believes that I argue with him because I have way too much free time snd would want to argue with an insufferable person like him knowing how cynical and condescending he is during arguments. 

I'm sorry this post is so long but I'm at a lost. Would appreciate any opinions/advice. ",1,1735603278.0,AmITheJerk,0,1.0,False
1hq1gdo,https://www.reddit.com/r/covidlonghaulers/comments/1hq1gdo/the_same_thing_happened_to_me_from_covid_the/,"The same thing happened to me from covid, the vaccine, and monoclonal antibodies. Injured by all three - severe brain fog and pretty serious pem. ","I tried a lot in 2021. Wild type virus started my long haul in jan/feb. April was vaccine which further injured me. November was monoclonals. Again, peak long haul. Since then, ive known the covid antibody or idiopathic antibodies (antibodies to antibodies) were a major part of brain fog and pem. 

My brain fog is a lightheaded drunk like sensation (not a ""i sometimes forget the right words"").. i feel movement like pppd but it presents with pem and exertion. When it gets super bad i go into adrenaline dumps where i have pots like events, and severe severe wired feeling - like i drank 20 cups of coffee. 

 These antibodies have to be destroying our micro-vessels in some way. Thus anything that makes us create more antibodies in general will make us flare. Sick? Exercise? Stress? Certain Foods?

Ive watched everyone argue about viral persistence over the years, i think we get and clear fully replicating covid often, most covid infections are asymptomatic. In fact i feel best with an active covid infection, but then flare hard when i clear the virus. Ive seen similar accounts with the vaccine too. Our immune system focuses on the virus spike and not our nerves or vessels for a day or two during active infection or recent vaccination. In hiv we could find the persistence pretty quick, we havent seen the same thing here. We have persistence of virus, but not because we cant clear it, it's because it circulates and mutates so quickly. We are constantly exposed to it, so it is viral persistence, but its because we as a society cannot control the virus, and the virus is spreading at alarming rates (airborne). We thus get covid over and over and over always. We have also seen the exact same issues for vaccine long haulers and same for monoclonal abs.

The spike protein is sneaky, by itself it causes problems, but it also creates antibodies that also do damage. No wonder research cant figure this out, and the only reason i know, is my personal experiences, then watching others have slight variations of symptoms...which again proves to me we are all making similar antibodies (from the same spike) but from using partially different regions of the spike as antigens resulting in minor variations (neuropathy vs pots vs drunklike brainfog vs fatigue - most seem to share pem and muscle twitching). Our hydration is also out of wack due to a damaged raas, and potentially anti aquaporin antibodies (yale research coming on this in 2025). If water cant move freely, twitching, damaged cell respiration (energy), so on. 

 I think we are lucky to have the whole world focused on this, now we need to put politics aside and use our anecdotes along with research to solve this in a non biased way. ",6,1735603262.0,covidlonghaulers,3,0.8,False

1hq1fum,https://www.reddit.com/r/PEI/comments/1hq1fum/tyson_macdonald_globe_and_mail_article_copied/,Tyson MacDonald - Globe and Mail article - copied from FB post,"The boys of Montague Regional High School peeled out of the school parking lot by the carload on a Friday morning, just a little over a week before last year’s Christmas break. They headed south toward a patchwork of dirt roads, woods and farmers’ fields in Prince Edward Island in search of their missing classmate and friend Tyson MacDonald.
It was unlike the 17-year-old to not text his mother, to not show up at the hockey game the night before. His Honda Civic, in which he loved to burn around the countryside, sat in the school parking lot covered in snow from the day before.
Within days, Tyson’s body was found lying in a thicket about a 20-minute drive from the home he shared with his mom, younger brother and stepfather.
A year later, the sleepy agricultural hamlets of Kings County are still reeling from his killing, the deceit in the aftermath and questions about what justice means when those involved are teenagers. Tyson’s homicide has touched thousands, a judge recently remarked, leaving no one unscathed – his family and friends in grief, the halls of Montague High in turmoil and an undercurrent of anger in his home community of 8,000 and beyond.
In many ways, PEI seemed immune to the recent spike in youth homicide and violence that’s plagued the rest of the country. The island, known for its tight, friendly communities and barely noticeable crime rate, has the fewest number of homicides per capita in the country, averaging one a year over the past five years.
But Tyson’s killing shattered the sense of safety and community, leaving an outrage that is omnipresent to this day: It’s in the way a cashier snatches bills from the hand of a customer who’s protested outside every court appearance. The frozen stares in Tim Hortons when someone connected to the case pulls into the drive thru. And the local truck owner with stickers on the back windshield that say it with a profanity: Only in PEI can you get away with murder.

Like many rural Canadian communities, hockey is religion in Kings County. Here the talk of the town isn’t the Leafs or the Oilers. It’s who made the local select team. Who scored the hat trick. It’s fiercely competitive, and everyone knows the score.
The day before Tyson went missing, he soared over the ice at his game, firing the puck twice into the net for the AA Under 18 Kings County Kings. “Hey mom!” he yelled as he burst in the front door after the game on Dec. 13, 2023, his mother Amanda MacDonald recalled. He couldn’t wait to tell her of his exploits.
The next day, when school ended, Tyson jumped in the car of a classmate, a burly outgoing friend, whom The Globe is referring to as the teen because his identity is now protected by a publication ban under the Youth Criminal Justice Act. The two Grade 12 boys planned to attend a hockey game in Charlottetown that night, but first they headed back to the teen’s place to play video games.
At 7:20 p.m. she got a call from the teen and a second boy. Tyson had left with a girl, they claimed – a brown-haired girl with glasses in a dark Honda Civic. They told her the same story they repeated to police, friends and teachers. The teen provided a fantastic level of detail: She wore a fluorescent shirt and had a flower tattoo on her left arm. Tyson had been dropped off with her at her car, a 2010 model with yellow fog lights, tinted windows, steel rims and a G sticker on the windshield – last seen near the County Line Road.

After a sleepless night, Tyson’s mother called police on Friday morning.
The boys of Montague High were worried as they set out down Highway 315 to look for Tyson. His best friend Leo Cudmore, behind the wheel of his pickup truck, scanned the ditches and corn straw fields. The teen also joined in, leading his friends around the woods. Throngs of searchers joined the friends, family members and teachers combing the land on foot and astride ATVs, their eyes peeled for any sign of Kent and Amanda MacDonald’s oldest boy.
The high school opened its doors on the weekend for students to take a break from searching. Tyson’s sister, Britney, launched a social media page to track the public search. And she pored over her brother’s Instagram, looking for the brunette with the flower tattoo. “Is this her?” she texted the teen, sending pictures of random girls.
On the island of 178,000 people, connections between families run deep. It was no different for RCMP Staff Sergeant Mike Robinson, now head of the Montague detachment after nearly three decades in northern B.C. His father, a retired Mountie, had run the same detachment.
When Staff Sgt. Robinson heard the story from Ms. MacDonald, he felt the explanation for Tyson’s disappearance was off. The teen’s story didn’t add up. Over the weekend, he called on the major crime unit in Charlottetown. They seized the teen’s cellphone and dozens of officers along with drones, dogs and a helicopter descended on Eastern PEI.
Four days after Tyson’s disappearance, police discovered a large pool of blood in the woods off a back road. The case, RCMP advised the public, was now being investigated as a crime. They wouldn’t be needing any more tips on the unknown woman and the Honda Civic.
The town, initially worried, was now on edge, recalled Debbie Johnson, the mayor of Three Rivers, which includes seven rural municipalities in Kings County. “People were thinking ‘Do we have a murderer in the community?’”
Staff Sgt. Robinson warned Ms. MacDonald to brace herself for bad news. “No,” she recalled thinking. “No, he could still come.” She didn’t know this at the time, but police had arrested the two teen boys on suspicion of their involvement with Tyson’s disappearance.
The loud rap at the door came around 3:30 a.m., five days after Tyson disappeared. Ms. MacDonald, who was lying down with her youngest son, staggered to the door.
“We found Tyson,” Staff Sgt. Robinson told her in the porch light.
The teen had pointed out a location to police and Tyson’s remains were discovered off a nearby dirt road, stashed in a thicket of uprooted pines behind a blueberry field.
At Montague High, students were in shock as staff went class to class telling them the news. They packed up their school bags and huddled in groups in the hallway, sobbing and hugging.

The following day brought another blow. Two of their classmates had been charged with first-degree murder: the teen and the second boy who spread the story about Tyson going off with a girl.
The crime consumed the school. The rumour mill erupted. Was it over a girl? Was the teen jealous that he hadn’t made the AA hockey team? No one could understand why anyone would want to kill Tyson – an introvert with a big smile, who dropped by his grandmother’s house nearly every day for lunch. Teachers, thinking of how the teen repeated his story to them at school, were incredulous: Was he playing us? they wondered.
Over the course of the school year and the beginning of the next, attendance dropped off and students struggled to stay engaged. Exams were postponed. Stress and anger over the killing and who was responsible bubbled over. Fights erupted between friends. Others distanced themselves from each other, withdrew from activities, and abused drugs and alcohol.
It wasn’t until October, 10 months after he was killed, that the first details of the crime publicly emerged – a statement of facts read out in court on the same day the teen pleaded guilty to manslaughter under a deal with the prosecution.
It went like this: The boys were about to leave for the hockey game when the teen said there was a shotgun near the door. Tyson picked it up, pointed it jokingly at his friend, and set it back down.
The teen grabbed hold of the weapon and pointed it at his friend. Without checking to see whether the safety was on, he pulled the trigger and shot Tyson on the left side of his face in the front porch of the home. The teen panicked. He rolled Tyson’s body in a mat and shoved him into the back seat of his Ford Focus. He drove to a secluded asphalt road and dumped his friend’s body in a field in the freezing cold night.
He then picked up the second boy and the two headed into Charlottetown for the hockey game.
Days later, as the police search closed in on Tyson’s remains, the teen returned to the spot where he had dumped the body off the Greek River Road. He put his friend’s remains back in his car, drove 10 minutes down the road, and discarded him in the bush again, according to cellular records obtained by police.

The teen was sentenced on a dreary day in Charlottetown last month. Now 18, he clinked into the courtroom with shackles on his ankles, his eyes cast down. Tyson’s family – his parents, stepparents and three siblings – stared silently from a front row bench. Several sheriffs stood between them and the teen’s parents who sat alone across the aisle, his father hunched with his eyes closed, his mother weeping quietly.
Among the 100 or so people who spilled into a second courtroom to watch the proceeding were Tyson’s classmates, many wearing blue hoodies with a gold screen-printed image of him with angel wings gripping a hockey stick. The teen, in slacks and a button-up shirt, remained expressionless as the court heard how Tyson’s killing shattered his family and destroyed the tight-knit community’s sense of trust.
Ms. MacDonald spoke of the callous way her son’s body was left in the elements alone for five days, and how this robbed her and his loved ones of the chance to say goodbye. “We were told by my doctor and the funeral home that we should remember Tyson the way he was,” she told the court. “I always wonder – maybe I should have just seen his hand to hold one more time.”
She spoke of the agony of waking up every day without Tyson. How she misses the way he thundered up the stairs from his bedroom to get a glass of water. How he left all the cupboard doors wide open in the kitchen. Ripped open cereal boxes. His enormous appetite for pizza.
Many had been calling for the teen to be sentenced as an adult. Crown prosecutor John Diamond said he didn’t apply to do so because he didn’t see a prospect of meeting the legal test; the teen’s psychological education assessments showed he had a mild to moderate learning disability and he had no criminal record.
The court heard that the teen showed remorse, saying that if he could go back in time, he would have immediately called police after shooting Tyson.
The judge accepted a joint recommended sentence, handing the teen two years in custody and one year in the community under supervision for manslaughter, as well as 18 months in jail and six months under community supervision for interfering with human remains, to be served concurrently.
Tyson’s family was appalled. “I’m left speechless after today that the justice system thought my boy’s life was only worth two years,” wrote Tyson’s father, Kent MacDonald, on social media.
“He got two years – two years for taking someone’s life,” his best friend, Leo, said. “It doesn’t seem very fair.”
Friends since the second grade, the two dirt biked, fished and attended parties together. After high school they planned to travel, get an apartment and study trades. Now, Leo works at a beef farm. He sits at home most Friday nights by himself, goes to bed at 9:30 p.m.

The hardest fact of all, Ms. MacDonald and her daughters Sierra and Britney say, is that they may never know why Tyson was killed. Why, if it was an accident, did the teen hide the body? Why weave a web of lies? They’re also skeptical about the second boy’s involvement, though the court has accepted it as fact that he wasn’t present when Tyson’s body was moved.
At the family bungalow in the rural community of Belfast, Ms. MacDonald replays the deceit in her head: The Snapchat call from the teen where she recalled him saying, “I made sure he had his keys.” (Tyson’s car keys were later found thrown deep in the woods near his remains.) How the teen sat on her brown leather sofa – the same one Tyson used to curl up on with his golden retriever Stella – and fed her lies and accepted her hugs. (She later donated the sofa because she couldn’t bear to have it in the house.) “It just makes you sick.”
Tyson’s sister, Sierra, said the family would feel better if they believed it was an accident, but they’re not convinced it was. “We’re scared for him to come back in the community because we don’t know necessarily why it happened,” she said.
Leo echoes the family’s pain over what really happened between Tyson and the teen. “Everybody was mad about him getting away with it, but a lot of people just wanted to know why,” he said. “Why he would do that?”
The second boy, meanwhile, has already been released from youth jail after accepting a plea deal in February. Charges of first-degree murder, accessory after the fact and indignity to human remains were stayed and he pleaded guilty to public mischief and obstruction of justice for misleading police on a fruitless search for Tyson.
In court, he apologized for the harm he caused. The case has severely affected their lives, says the second boy’s father, who cannot be identified because of the publication ban on his son’s name. “We are giving the family their time and then we will have ours,” he said in a message.
In connection to the homicide, the teen’s father, 61, pleaded guilty to charges of unsafe storage of a firearm and ammunition. On Dec. 12, he was handed a $750 fine and banned from owning firearms for a decade.

At hockey rinks all over the island, Tyson is remembered. Teams raised thousands in support of a scholarship fund in his name. His No. 8 jersey, now retired, hangs in the local rink. Kings County Kings players wear his number on their helmets in his memory.
But there remains a heaviness, a sense of injustice in eastern PEI.
No matter where you go – the coffee shop, the auto parts store, the ferry – there are chance encounters between grandparents, parents and teens who used to be friends, but are now divided and bitter over the case.
The feeling of awkwardness will likely last generations, said Tyson’s former hockey coach Cory Deagle, the MLA for the district of Montague-Kilmuir, and Minister of Economic Development, Innovation and Trade. “There’s a big sense of distrust,” he said. “There’s still a cloud over the community. There’s still a lot of questions in the community and I don’t know if they’ll ever be answered or maybe they can’t be.”
And then there are those harsh words on the back of the F150. While he didn’t know Tyson, the truck’s owner, Kevin McGuigan of Montague, said he posted the message because he’s angry.
“I think them boys should’ve got a lot more than they did. Nobody can tell me it was an accident,” he said, adding that locals have shown support for his statement, buying him coffee, blowing their horn and giving him the thumbs-up. “I laid in bed a lot of nights thinking about that poor little boy lying in the woods.”
At Montague High, the pain persists. The school has been forever changed, principal Robyn MacDonald wrote in the school’s victim impact statement, presented at the teen’s sentencing. (She’s not related to Tyson’s family.)
She said school staff have done everything in their power to help students, consulting with trauma experts, bringing in a motivational speaker, holding town hall meetings, but it hasn’t been enough. She cited more fights between students this year than ever before. “Tension is high, and a growing trend of vigilante justice has emerged,” she wrote.
At the Grade 12 graduation in June, Leo, standing in his cap and gown, watched Tyson’s sister Britney accept his diploma and the crowd rise to emotional standing ovation. “It should’ve been him,” Leo recalled thinking. “It felt wrong.”
The crime changed everyone, said Angela Patton of Montague, a mother of two teenagers and a young adult, who joined the search for Tyson and attended court.
“Everybody doesn’t know who to trust anymore,” she said. “My kid is asking me ‘Can I trust my friends?’ I had to step back – my child is asking this question. Where did PEI go?”

1hq1f6c,https://www.reddit.com/r/birthcontrol/comments/1hq1f6c/my_partner_is_mad_at_me_because_i_cant_control/,My partner is mad at me because I can’t control myself during a hormonal imbalance when on the pill ,"For context, I started taking Diane-35 in Jan 2024 but stopped after 3 months as I noticed some changes in my face. I have always had clear skin so when I started breaking out, I was really stressed and anxious so I recently started taking Diane-35 again and I'm still on my first pack. 

I've noticed that I've been very easily irritable and I just didn't think to communicate what I was going through with my partner because I myself am trying to figure myself out. My partner has never been the type of person to check in on me to see how I'm doing because apparently men don't do that sh*t. The way I think is that sometimes, we don't even think about telling them something unless prompted to do so. For more context, my partner works a full-time job and I have not been working but will start working full time in a couple of months. I pay the same amount of rent all just the same as he. I tend to the house and take care of the dishes, laundry, cat, etc. My partner vacuums and takes out the trash. 

Now onto the issue: Last night at 1am, I was very sleepy and told my partner I'm going to bed. We had dinner while watching TV on the couch so there was a paper bag with rubbish by the couch and a dirty plate on the coffee table. I walked into the room and he started getting ready to come to bed. I was already so sleepy but I still had to put the rubbish and dishes away and because of my frustration from his lack of effort to help me, I snapped and got mad. Normally, I am very aware of myself and try not to have any outbursts because he is the type of person to take it personally and does not think he could've done anything better. Because of my hormonal imbalance, I snapped and his excuse was he didn't see the dirty dish and rubbish. I find that really crazy because it was right in front of us the entire 3 hours and he's saying he didnt notice it. 

He then got mad because of my reaction and argued with me telling me not to use my hormones as an excuse when he has never tried to understand my perspective. Might I add, when I was going to have my surgery for polyps and fibroid removal, it was my first surgery and I was really scared but he decided to argue with me the night before my surgery and he wasn't even there with me despite only being 2 hours away. He decided he could not cancel his plans with his friends just for me. He argued that the argument last night could've been avoided if i controlled my reaction but I simply couldn't because it just slipped. I didn't do it intentionally but it happened and it slipped. The way I think is that the argument could've been avoided if he cared enough to know what I was going through but apparently the way I think is wrong. The amount of opportunities he could've used to ask me why I was recently irritable instead of saying he thinks I am bipolar just makes me even more upset. He also strongly believes that I argue with him because I have way too much free time snd would want to argue with an insufferable person like him knowing how cynical and condescending he is during arguments. 

I'm sorry this post is so long but I'm at a lost. Would appreciate any opinions/advice. ",1,1735603181.0,birthcontrol,2,1.0,False

It featured various mythological stories, including:

* Jason & the golden fleece
* Odysseus & the Cyclops
* Sir Gawain & the green knight
* Theseus & the minotaur
* Daedalus & Icarus
* Perseus & Medusa
* Thor & the stone giants
* Bellerephon & Pegasus vs. the chimera
* Beowulf & Grendel

I vividly remember the illustrations which were very detailed and quite intense, especially for children. Some of the more violent illustrations included:

* The Cyclops eating some of Odysseus's men, with a few arms and legs sticking out of his mouth
* Odysseus and his men ramming a burning spear into the Cyclops' eye
* Grendel about to slaughter one of Beowulf's men
* The green knight holding his own decapitated head
* Perseus holding up Medusa's severed head

One other thing I remember is that there was a companion book that was specifically about legends, and featured stories such as the Trojan horse and El Cid, with illustrations by the same artist in the same style. So one of the books was specifically about ""myths"" while the other was about ""legends"". I have attempted to use Google image search to find the matching illustrations, with no luck.

I  did not find a copy among the David Whitmer Collection in [Early Mormon Documents: Volume 5](https://archive.org/details/volume-5_202011/page/n3/mode/2up) by Dan Vogel, which is likely due to this interview being focused on the Ohio period, not the New York / Pennsylvania period. According to the U.S. Library of Congress, issues of the newspaper during this time period are available in a variety of Iowa state historical society offices.

Note that in the years 1880–1888, David Whitmer did a flurry of interviews, perhaps because he could tell that he was getting to his twilight years and wanted to tell his own side of Mormon history. Note that his book An Address to all Believers in Christ, by David Whitmer was published in 1887, and he died on January 25, 1888.

Quotes below taken from Mormonthink.com:

[Kirtland Temple Visitation](http://www.mormonthink.com/QUOTES/kirtlandtemple.htm)

>“The great heavenly ‘visitation,' which was alleged to have taken place in the temple at Kirtland, was a grand fizzle. The elders were assembled on the appointed day, which was promised would be a veritable day of Pentecost, but there was no visitation. No Peter, James and John; no Moses and Elias, put in an appearance. ‘I was in my seat on that occasion,' says Mr. Whitmer, ‘and I know that the story sensationally circulated, and which is now on the records of the Utah Mormons as an actual happening, was nothing but a trumped up yarn...”

>\- High Priest David Whitmer, one of the Three Witnesses, The Des Moines Daily News, Oct. 16, 1886; online at Link is here.

[Word of Wisdom](http://www.mormonthink.com/QUOTES/wow.htm)

>David Whitmer (1805 - 1888):

>“Some of the men were excessive chewers of the filthy weed, and their disgusting slobbering and spitting cause Mrs. \[Emma\] Smith... to make the ironical remark that ‘It would be a good thing if a revelation could be had declaring the use of tobacco a sin, and commanding its suppression'.... The matter was taken up and joked about, one of the brethren suggested that the revelation should also provide for a total abstinence from tea and coffee drinking, intending this as a counter dig at the sisters.”

>\- High Priest David Whitmer, one of the Three Witnesses, quote in Des Moines Daily News, October 16, 1886, p. 20

1hq15k1,https://www.reddit.com/r/trintellix/comments/1hq15k1/why_im_coming_off_trintillex_for_current_users/,Why I'm coming off trintillex (for current users only),"Disclaimer: if you're just starting trint, skip this post. This drug has been a huge help to me and pulled me out of a dark time. The experience I am sharing is pretty unique and not the typical experience. I'm sharing in case current users relate.

Ok, so why I'm stopping:

Trint helped my depression and anxiety but had a strange side effect of increasing my sensitivity to just about everything.

Coffee would make me instantly feel lower and strange. Alcohol was a no go. And I became far more sensitive to changes in my menstrual cycle. I'd get crazy before my period and ended up getting a new PMDD doagnosis.

Strangest of all I became highly sensitive to secondhand weed smoke. I've enjoyed smoking in the past but while I was on trint, if someone smoked near me I'd feel skewiffy for days. 

This might not be linked to the trint but rather an unusual progression in my mental health. However, I've now switched back to sertraline in the hope the hyper sensitivity will go away. This all started with trint so I am cautiously optimistic.

All in all, I dont regret my time on trint as I have improved significantly. But yeah, I've had a strange experience with the intense reactions to hormone changes, coffee, alcohol, and THC from smoke (yes, I know the amount is extremely minute, but this is my lived experience).

I am curious if anyone else has experienced anything remotely similar. Otherwise, I'll be back over on r/zoloft. 

Best of luck to everyone here. ",3,1735602457.0,trintellix,0,1.0,False

1hq136g,https://www.reddit.com/r/holbox/comments/1hq136g/hoblox_is_one_of_the_next_global_hot_spots/,Hoblox is one of the next global hot spots,"People are always looking for the next hot spot (ex. ""the next Tulum"" or ""the next Bali"") and it's starting to become clear that Hoblox along with Sayulita and Tamarindo (Costa Rica) are likely going to be part of that next wave. Hoblox is seeing clear growth in tourism, expats, and nomads. New hotels, restaurants, and bars are being built all over. I'm starting to see lots of Hoblox Instagram ""aesthetic"" posts and ""My Vlog in Hoblox"" Youtube videos. 

Hoblox has a lot going for it as the next hot spot. Proximity to Cancun and the United States make it relatively easy to get too. The town is \*right on\* the beach which gives the town even more of a beach town feel compared to Tulum. The street grid on the west side of town is all set up for rapid expansion of hotels and residential development. Being on the Gulf Coast, the beaches are actually much better for swimming than say Tulum. 

Remember, it's all cyclical. Pioneer expats go to rustic beach town to escape busy areas and get somewhere cheaper, the first few restaurants/coffee shops/hotels open up, pics start popping up on Instagram of a cool new ""untouched"" ""uncommercialized"" escape where all the young hot nomads go, word gets out, beach town becomes busier and established with consistent business, people invest in infrastructure and businesses and residences, then the beach town becomes commercialized as bigger brands move in, and eventually the pioneers leave and find the next cheap rustic beach town. Same thing happened to Tulum and Bali and Medellin and it will happen to Hoblox and Sayulita and Tamarindo.

Right now we are at the ""beach town becomes busier and established with consistent business"" step of the cycle. 

The geography of Hoblox will ultimately limit the growth to some degree. Perhaps that will lead to smaller scale boutique development as opposed to mass tourism resorts. But either way it's clear Hoblox is one of the next hot spots.",2,1735602277.0,holbox,4,0.75,False

After months of grinding—late 3am nights, endless debugging, and more caffeine than I’d like to admit—I finally got my first paid customer.

This journey has been wild. Building the serverless front end, wrestling with multiple back-end logic, setting up authentication, integrating APIs, and don’t even get me started on Stripe. Migrating between templates and from test to production felt like defusing a bomb. One wrong move and *poof*—everything could’ve blown up.

Honestly, I don’t know how I would’ve made it without tools like ChatGPT. Every time I hit a wall, it was like having a dev who somehow knew all the answers. Although sometimes it did get stuck in loops of repeating the same wrong solution. 

And now, after all the stress and self-doubt, someone actually paid for what I built. Real money. For something I created. It’s surreal.

Funny thing is, rather than this being the most active user (project has been up for almost a year), the first customer was a new user today xD

If you’re working on a side project and feeling stuck, keep going. The grind is brutal, but moments like this make it all worth it.

**Namesake:** Band of the same name

**Stand Appearance:** N/A

Primus is fully integrated into the user’s body similar to Stands like Love Deluxe, Khnum, or THE Hustle.

**Stand Ability:** Primus gives the user the ability to fold their body as if it was made of paper. As well as flatten their body into a two dimensional form. The limit of this ability is unknown. However the current user has managed to fold his body so that he can fit inside incredibly small spaces such as the inside of packages, crevices between walls and furniture, and  between the cushions of couches. He’s also managed to flatten his body to slip through cracks beneath locked doors. The user does feel mild pain from manipulating their body in such a way, however the more it’s used the less painful it becomes.

**Stand User:** Affogato

Affogato is a member of Passione’s debt collecting division. His job is to make sure people pay their dues to Passione on time. Whether it’s paying back a loan, gambling debts, or protection money, Affogato is assigned to make sure the debt is paid in full in a timely manner.

A tall, slim man with flamboyant fashion sense, Affogato is quite imposing towards his debt collection targets. Usually he’s able to get them to pay him back with no trouble. But if they refuse, then that’s when the trouble begins.

In the event someone can’t or won’t pay back their debt, Affogato uses Primus to break into the target’s house. So far no locked door or security system has been able to stop him. He can simply fold and flatten himself to quite literally slip through the cracks in security. A few times he’s even mailed himself to the victim. Once there he either steals the money or roughs up the target until they give him the money. He prefers to avoid killing when necessary, as killing a debtor means he can’t collect from them anymore.

A cold and quiet man, Affogato is feared by those who owe him money. Although other members of Passione consider him a bully and a coward since he typically goes up against those who he knows can’t fight back. When faced with an opponent tougher than himself, Affogato is more than likely to use Primus to slip away from the fight instead of facing them directly.

**Stand Stats:**

**Power:** E (No power beyond folding and flattening the user)

**Speed:** E (The Stand is integrated into the user and thus cannot move)

**Range:** E (The Stand’s range is limited to Affogato’s body)

**Durability:** A (Primus is always active)

**Precision:** E (Only as precise as Affogato is)

**Potential:** C (With training, Affogato could continue to test the limits of his Stand and see how far he’s able to fold and flatten himself)

**Additional Notes:** To keep with Passione's theme naming, Affogato gets his name from a type of Italian dessert that's a scoop of gelato with coffee poured on top.

I told them that we're looking for a new general dentist and to get our regular cleaning soon since with the move and work it's been 8 months. Their front office told me that they have availability the next day and could see both of us at the same time. I was surprised, but pretty stoked.

We get to the office about 20 mins before the appointment just in case there's a lot of paperwork. The office has a nice waiting area and a chill atmosphere. We receive the documents that we need to read and look through. Most of it is pretty routine, until I get to a form that says to sign acknowledging that we received the HIPAA. I look through the paperwork and there was no HIPAA. So I figured it was missed and went to the desk to request it. My exact words were, ""Hi, this form says to sign after I've received the HIPAA. I don't see it in my stack, could I please get a copy?""   
  
The older staff lady said, ""Just sign it. You'll get it."" 

I respond, ""It says, I'm supposed to sign after I receive it?""

She responds with some irritation, ""Sign it to give us permission to send it electronically.""

It feels weird, because no other office I've been a patient at has ever done it this way, but I come to the conclusion that it's not a big deal and sign the form. 

They take my partner back first and then it's another 40 minutes before I'm brought back for my appointment. I chalk it up to maybe they're running behind and read their coffee table art book. It's not a big inconvenience since we didn't have anything time sensitive scheduled for the day. 

They finally bring me back and I ask to use the restroom. Where everywhere else had looked pretty well maintained and clean, the bathroom was surprisingly dirty. The toilet had a thick dark ring around the drain like it hadn't been cleaned in weeks. There was a layer of dust on surfaces and no paper towels. I start to feel a little offput, but remind myself that they have received a ton of great patient feedback.

I get to the treatment room and my discomfort increases. It's a completely open treatment area. There are 5 or 6 bays with a half wall in between each one...but all the treatment chairs stick out so I can see everyone who is getting worked on as I walk by as well as the screen where their x-rays and photos are. When I'm actually in the treatment chair, my partner and I literally make eye contact and I can hear everything the doctor is telling her about her treatment plan. I can hear the treatment plan for the stranger on my right as well and see him just lying there. It's incredibly bizarre and I have a flashback to the HIPAA and wonder how this office can be compliant?

A dental assistant comes and takes my x-rays and uses a machine that does a digital work up of my teeth. Some cool technology for sure. Then the dentist comes to me and says that I need a bunch of fillings. I'm slightly alarmed at this point because at my last cleaning my dentist hadn't mentioned anything other than a couple of teeth that might need a filling in the future but he wasn't concerned about them. The new dentist tells me that I need Invisalign for my overbite and I'm already aware of this since my previous dentist had recommended it and we were starting to talk about treatment plans before I moved. She talks me through her recommendations and then moves over to talk to my partner about her treatment. Then a dental assistant comes to talk to me while I'm laying there and starts pushing this $200 electronic toothbrush with several settings including ""whitening."" I ask her about the whitening setting because I'm confused about how just the toothbrush would achieve that and she just looks at me blankly and says she doesn't know. 

Then the lady from the front office comes over with a clipboard and a bunch of numbers written on it and starts talking really quickly about treatment and fees and all the things I'm getting done today (which I hadn't agreed to yet). She mentions a crown and I tell her I'm not getting a crown, the dentist only mentioned fillings. She snapped  that the filling she wrote down means crown. I responded ""Could you please double check with the dentist?"" She does and the dentist confirms that it's just a filling. Office lady reworks her numbers and comes back. The fee is incredibly high and I ask her, did you check my insurance? And she said the numbers are after what insurance will cover. Then she starts pushing that dang toothbrush as well omg She then brings a card processor over to the treatment chair and has me pay upfront. Paying upfront wasn't the issue, just the weirdness of literally being in the treatment chair and kind of being railroaded into paying right in that moment rather than going back to the front desk. Both myself and my partner request an itemized receipt for our records and she agrees to have that ready at the end.

At this point I'm considering my options and feeling kind of uneasy about the whole situation and also nervous that maybe there is something up with my teeth. I grew up poor and my family rarely visited the dentist so I have some nervousness about wanting to do right by my teeth now that I have access to insurance and care. I compromise and let the dentist do four fillings and the cleaning. It...was not a good experience. I was in the chair for over 4 hours and the cleaning at the end was worst I've ever had. There was water spraying everywhere, I found out the anti-bacterial treatment they were administering for over $100 was just the betadine you can get at the store for $13 and easily dilute yourself, the area where they did the filling has a raised texture on the side that's obviously not supposed to be there. 

After the treatment I went back to the front desk for the itemized receipt and the older office lady snaps that she'll send it after the doctor has a chance to look it over. I figure that's fine since it's now the end of their workday and frankly I'm just ready to go home. My partner and I both leave feeling really weird and taken advantage of. I especially wish I'd advocated to just have the cleaning done that day and get a second opinion on treatment. Or just left entirely. 

I emailed the office that night a reminder about the requested itemized receipt, copies of our xrays, and the HIPAA which we still hadn't received. Their office emails back and says that each copy of the xrays will be $25. I am shocked. I google if there are any guidelines regarding patient records and fees and respond back to their email,   
  
""Thank you for getting back to me!  I want to double check that the fee wasn't mistyped since from my understanding of the guidelines set out by the California Dental Association, the practice is permitted to charge .25 cents  per page or .50 cents per page for microfilm. We're just requesting email or paper copies of our xrays so if the fee is actually $25 per page, that rather exceeds the guidelines and we'd like to understand why that would be?  
  
Also, if you would be so kind as to send us the HIPAA? When we were filling out the intake forms, I'd requested to see the HIPAA before I would sign the document asserting that we'd already received it (since we hadn't yet) and was told that we needed to sign the bottom of the form in order to provide permission for electronic transfer of the HIPAA to our email. We haven't received that yet and want to make sure we have all our ducks in a row!""

It's been 2 weeks with no response (and I'm leaving room for the fact that it's also holiday season). I also checked our insurance, and they still haven't submitted a claim, which is strange since with other offices the claim is sent within 48 hours or in a week. 

Has anyone else dealt with something like this and have any advice? I'd hate to have to escalate the situation, but the longer this goes on, the scummier it seems/feels.",1,1735601458.0,AskLosAngeles,17,0.56,False

Posted here the other week about dating three different women in the early stages. I've been out with two of them twice, and the third is someone I have a lot of rapport with through a social sports club (she has bought me drinks before at events, always touching me, etc) but hadn't been out 1v1 with yet. 

Today she texted me and asked me to get coffee and things we're going well during that so I suggested we grab a drink after. She enthusiastically agreed and we grabbed two cocktails nearby. She was laughing, touching me, etc. the whole time and even though I'm not clairvoyant, it really seemed like she was into me.

At the end of the evening I went in for a kiss and got wholly rejected, with her saying that she was ""intrigued by me but didn't date people in the club."" I told her I respected that and then we parted ways.

Did I fuck up by going for it too soon and maybe coming on too strong? Maybe I should have just tried a hug and let her come to me later? I'm fine taking a loss, but I just want to learn from it.",0,1735601388.0,CoreyWayne,4,0.5,False

1hq0giz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1hq0giz/mini_bingo_reviews/,Mini Bingo Reviews,"One of my main aims of this year, having decided to join in on the bingo challenge, was to come out of my comfort zone with reading and experience more in the fantasy genre. My reading life since has been absolutely amazing and I've had a wonderful year with new authors, genres and books, a lot of which I am now in love with. I couldn't have done this without finding this reddit and joining the challenge, so here are my short reviews for 16 bingo squares completed in 2024. I'd love to hear what you thought of these if you've read any.

1) Leviathan Wakes, James S.A. Corey (First in a Series, HM) 4/5  
  
A brilliant space opera, character driven with an intriguing plot. Add the noir detective elements and it’s one you won’t want to put down! Typically, it’s a series – of 9!! Yet each one, I’ve discovered so far (I’ve finished 5) adds more to this wonderful universe and makes The Expanse a thoroughly enjoyable experience and one of my best of the year. 

2) The Luminous Dead, Caitlin Starling (Under the Surface, HM) 3.5/5

A claustrophobic experience full of edge-of-your-seat turn-the-page intrigue and terror, an in-experienced cave-diver’s lie lands her in more trouble than she imagined when she agrees a mission with an aggressive and immoral “handler” who’ll do anything to achieve her own outcome. The atmosphere in this is palpable – the claustrophobia illustrated to experience the reader; supernatural hints, mistrust between the protagonists and the intriguing plot, weave and wind together to produce secrets, paranoia, fear and the truth that eludes at least one of them for too long.   

3) Six of Crows, Leigh Bardugo (Criminals, HM) 4.5/5

This is a tale where the characters matter more than the plot. The plot is secondary, but intrinsic to the character development. It’s odd. Marketed as Young Adult, it feels deliberately aged-down, but it’s not – it’s merely a different universe, akin to John Wick if you like; where teenagers rule the roost, and tragedy strikes and hits hard at far too young an age. Nevertheless, twists and turns abound in this high-stakes heist, and it doesn’t disappoint! I wasn’t aware at the time that there was a sequel – Crooked Kingdom – until Six of Crows ended on an insane cliff-hanger, but I picked up the sequel and it gives wonderful closure to the duology. No need to read the Shadow & Bone series IMO, I haven’t. 

4) Legends & Lattes, Travis Baldree (Prologues & Epilogues, HM) 4.5/5

Way out my comfort zone is where this jewel abides! Cosy fantasy? No! But yes! I’m glad I ventured out because this gorgeous, somewhat simple tale of a retired warrior Orc, Viv and her desire to run a coffee shop in a new town where her past shouldn’t follow is divine! Yes, stuff happens. Yes, there are tropes. But it’s a wonderfully fulfilling story that I didn’t know I needed. And there’s a sequel!

5) The Long Way to a Small Angry Planet, Becky Chambers (Space Opera, HM) 3.5/5

This Firefly-esque space opera is cosy sci-fi, if there is such a thing. The characters are fully fleshed out, and the plot arcs are satisfyingly resolved. Everyone is very polite and nice. It’s a nice, easy read with decent pace and well written.

6) Dallergut Dream Department Store, Miye Lee (Author of Colour, HM) 3/5

A whimsical delight, reminiscent in some ways of Dahl’s BFG & Mr. Magorium’s Wonder Emporium that can fall into the cosy category. The story follows the latest employee of the department store as she learns the tricks of the trade and the importance of the right dream for the right person. A lovely story that could have been so much more but was very enjoyable.        

7) Project Hail Mary, Andy Weir (Survival, HM) 5/5  
  
Alone, with amnesia, Ryland Grace wakes up in space and we follow him on his journey to save humankind itself. Filled with challenges, oh-so very important encounters and questions of morality that demand answers, Project Hail Mary unveils, a step at a time, the importance of doing the right thing and the courage it takes, the importance of friendship regardless of flaws, the acknowledgement of the danger of isolation and the pressures of being the one person who can change the future. Full of edge-of-your-page tension in one place and humour filled scenarios the next, PHM is well worth the time and the audio version really ramps up the enjoyment.

8) Annihilation, Jeff VanderMeer (Eldritch Creatures, HM) 5/5

By far the most disconcerting and eerie books I’ve read, Annihilation leads us to an explored, yet still unknown Area X. This expedition, all women. Our protagonist known only as the Biologist. Difficult to explain without spoilers because of its bizarre, mesmerising content, this uniquely atmospheric novella allows the reader to sense and experience both the natural and the supernatural in a most intriguing way. This fine balance does not disappoint, nor quench the need for more.   

9) How to Become the Dark Lord and Die Trying, Django Wexler (Ref. Materials, HM) 4/5

Hilarious, sarcastic, meta-filled yet intense, How to Become the Dark Lord is a fabulous tale that turns the idea of being a hero on its head. Davi, fed up with trying to save the day (and the world) the way she’s been told to, decides to do the opposite and become the Dark Lord she’s got to fight, herself. Madness ensues and results in the expectedly unexpected. A wonderful weaving of character and plot, great pace and writing style and while the ending was not what I imagined, it’s a mighty satisfying one.     

10) The Wings Upon Her Back, Samantha Mills (Bookclub/Readalong, HM) 5/5

I wouldn’t have picked this book myself unless I had spied the stunning cover – something that can result in various experiences these days. Had I not chosen it for this category though, I would have missed out on something special. A beautiful tale of coming-of-age and adolescence, Wings follows Zenya, now Zemolai, through various stages of her life. There is an abundance of themes apparent in this novel – religious zealotry, legalism, faith, belief, self-belief, corruption, abuse of power, self-discovery – yet there are still more, deftly woven in, out and particularly beneath this unique steam-punk futuristic tapestry.  
11) Hooked, A.C. Wise (Dreams, HM) 3.5/5

A sequel to Wendy, Darling, but can be read without having experience the first book. This story follows Hook’s escape from Neverland and the consequences of his actions. James grapples with his life and the life of others in this twisted representation of our heroic Peter Pan and his Lost Boys. Hooked demonstrates the power of the rhetoric: an endless lifetime of hero vs. villain reversed to reveal the unexpected. The truth of Neverland, and the danger posed to the present and future of its inhabitants and visitors.

12) A Rival Most Vial, R.K. Ashwick (Romantasy, HM) 4/5

I don’t do romance well, if at all, and it took three tries for me to find a romantasy I could settle into. The third time, A Rival Most Vial, was the charm. And it is a very charming tale. Two potion makers who hate each other must work together on a project and learn a lot about each other while they do. Tropes that don’t feel forced, (enemies to friends to more, found family) brilliant character focus along with a decent plot, and well-paced, this cosy and satisfying story left me with a smile on my face.

13) Sabriel, Garth Nix (Published in the 1990’s, HM) 4.5/5

A friend told me that “a little bit of Nix is good for the soul,” and he wasn’t wrong! This is a gorgeous book - brilliant magic system, great characters, great world building, fab plot, decent dialogue and solidly paced, Garth Nix has won a place in my heart and so has this book.

14) Starling House, Alix E. Harrow (Set in a Small Town, HM) 3/5

I enjoyed this one. It’s intriguing, has a good plot and atmosphere, and the characters are interesting, but for some reason I just didn’t connect with it very well. That’s odd for me, but I’ve also had a few DNF’s this year, and that’s new too. There’s nothing wrong with this book at all, and I may re-visit it in the future, but for now it’s just not for me.

15) A Demon in the Desert, Ashe Armstrong (Orcs, Trolls & Goblins! Oh My!, HM) 3/5

This is a really good book with a great premise, and I quite enjoyed it, but I found it very slow-paced. I love Grimluk – he’s a lovely Orc Demon hunter, but he’s so polite! Too polite maybe? Anyway, there’s a good plot and decent characters, and while I understand that it was a Kickstarter project, a re-edit would do it a world of good. I enjoyed it though, and I may even check out the sequels to see what Grimluk’s getting up to.

16) The Sign of the Dragon, Mary Soon Lee (Self-Published, HM) 5/5

This is one of the most amazing things I have ever read. What a story! What depth of character! What a Kingdom! What a King! 341 different poems/prose extracts over 863 pages about a young man who loves horses, and whose exceptional character changes the lives of those around him. There is honour, loyalty, abandonment, revenge, dragons, magical creatures, battles, politics, death, grief and love, all within these pages and it’s wonderfully done.

You find yourself the target of one of Mika's harmless pranks! Maybe she tied your shoelaces together while you weren’t looking, left a silly note in your bag, or even swapped your drink with something unusual but safe (like tea instead of coffee).

How do you react? Do you laugh it off, play along, or take it more seriously and give her a little lecture about boundaries? Mika, with her signature mischievous grin and a twinkle in her eye, is ready to take whatever response you throw her way.

**Optional Guidelines:**

Tone: Decide if you want your character to be amused, annoyed, or a mix of both.

Relationship with Mika: Are you meeting her for the first time, or do you already know her and expect her antics?

Follow-up: Does your character prank her back, ask her why she does it, or maybe try to cheer her up if you sense her guilt?

Emotion: Feel free to explore your character's emotions in the scene. Do you think there's more to her mischief than meets the eye?

Anyone care to share changes they’ll be making? Today I called my ex turned friend (we broke up 5 years ago) to tell him about a failed situation with someone I like very much romantically and am sad about, and his response is “I told you to fix your teeth.” In 2025, I’m done with all toxic men, esp exes who act like I’m not “attractive enough” bcuz I didn’t do cosmetic procedures but 100 percent of the time we hang out they will try to sleep with me. This was my same friend who judged me for having a GoFundMe after going bankrupt from cancer treatment “why don’t you just get a 2nd job?” He also won’t let me talk about feeling sad, depressed, anxious or broke from cancer shit bcuz that’s “being negative and negative talk creates more negativity.”

Done with gross and lazy men. Had a first date the other night, we went on to a coffee shop the other night, we talked for literally 5 hours and he didn’t even offer to buy me a cup of coffee, just sat drinking coffee he got for himself. Then 2 days later asks for a home visit for the second date. Sir, I’ve known you for less than 48 hours; and if you can’t afford coffee, how can you afford popcorn? 

I’m onto my first gummy here shortly; I’m tired of thinking so damn much about the Man I wanted to be with, being broke bcuz just cancer shit, being alone, insomnia, my low paying job, and more….",21,1735600207.0,breastcancer,9,1.0,False

Are you making $45 $50 an hour right now as a skip driver like we did during the pandemic the fact that we made that much an hour during the pandemic means that the capacity is there within Society to support it.

People say there's so many drivers now they're competing against us I do not believe that for one minute because the system is self-regulating it's obvious that we have fewer orders but why are people not spending the money to use us.

I can tell you from my experience that we do not have any more drivers than during the pandemic and in fact we attracted a lot of drivers who want to make money during the pandemic and double dip on CERB.

How many children right now are at home with parents who are working who are latchkey and no meal and the parents can send a meal to them as a loving gesture to give them a treat because they can't be there for them because on like when the pandemic happened now they're at work.

People are still getting surgeries people are still getting sick people are still leaving the hospital there's all these different factors people require skip but they're not using us.

Now I can see you giving me pushback when I drive out the fact that people are not using bags and people could be getting cold food or that many of you were not pausing Dash or not pausing Uber and not pausing skip when you work one of the three apps and take an order so therefore you're not caught in the middle of different wait times and traffic and things giving bad service but if you were making $50 an hour but you're not making $50 an hour are you.

Do you think the average person for the sake of six bucks and a $3 tip are going to go out in a cold night get dressed go down to the local Burger King wait in line with terrible service because all of the fast food chains have been basically terrible service at the counter since the pandemic and then bring their food home cuz they have no bags so they're just going to leave it on the seat and then they get home it's going to be cold and then they can take their coat off and go back to watching movie they wanted to watch there has to be some other reason why they're not using us for the sake of $9.

And the one thing that is obvious right in front of us is food that we don't pick up on time in the restaurant and therefore it starts to get cold or we walk for that 20 seconds from the restaurant in the cold which takes that extra 3° or 4° off the food and then we walk from the car without using the bag in the cold and that takes another four degrees and so now the food has left 8° and instead of being 140° is now 121° and people notice.

But here you are not making $50 an hour you're not making $40 an hour you're not making $30 an hour on most days you're not making $20 an hour more than 50% of the days and many days we're now making $15 an hour after gas.

And here you would sit here and try to placate yourself and you would try to find reasons that you make every kind of an excuses for doing the one thing that could increase our customer service that would encourage them and assure them that they should trust us with their food so that we can get more business so we can make at least $30 an hour or $40 an hour.

And you guys are all getting butt hurt because I brought it up and you're getting upset because I dare it out the situation we'll find we'll go on forever making $15 an hour if that's what you want to waste your life doing and I'm fine with that for now until I do something better but you can go ahead and you can in Forever make $15 an hour because you refuse to well the perception of people's mind that we are abusing their food.

This is not about me judging you for not using a bag it's about me saying to you come on guys we're only making freaking 15 $20 an hour if Lucky we might be making 25 and somewhere in that system there's $50 an hour.

And what I'm saying to you is that when people see you leave the restaurant without a bag regardless whether you put it into a bag in the back of your seat they get the perception their food is not being handled correctly and once that perception gets embedded we cannot break that habit of perception.

People are creatures of habit and it is called traffic flow and every business knows that once you get your customers established into a traffic flow they will support your business and go there because they are comfortable with what they're going to receive for service.

A person will travel the same route every day they will go to the same coffee shop they will look for the same person that they might have a crush on whatever it is and that traffic flow will not go away until you reach a critical mass of f****** up and then when you hit that critical mass they will change their traffic flow.

This is what happened during the pandemic and why many businesses are having an issue right now because they were not smart enough to understand the value of traffic flow and routine and schedule.

One Chinese restaurant the prices went up a little bit and they raised their price basically $5 after tax on a combination plate and I told the owner no you should lose money for the next 12 months on that meal if you're smart because you're going to have to spend $100,000 in advertising to get back to customers that you're going to lose because of the fact that you have interrupted their pattern of ordering that combination every week or maybe three times a week.

No I understand that maybe not everybody's a salesperson here or not everybody has owned a business and had to spend good money to build traffic flow but I can tell you I was getting too combinations a week from that restaurant and I stopped eating Chinese food all together it broke my pattern.

Before they raise their price $5 I was spending $40 a week that's over $2,000 a year in that restaurant and I walked right out the door and not only did I not take it to another business I just stopped eating Chinese food.

Now I have about maybe five combination plates not from that restaurant by from other restaurants about five times a year.

So I get that their prices went up I totally do but they opportunistically grabbed five bucks and they took off the egg roll which was another detractor instead of just tossing on of $1.50 today and maybe a $1.50 in 8 months I would have slowly noticed that a little bit of a change my traffic pattern would not have changed and they would still be getting my $2,000 a year.

We are in the exact situation the pandemic established a brand new traffic flow pattern for people ordering food out but because of the people who's come in is doing a bad job who are not using bags who are not caring about the customer they are trying to juggle for Too Many Masters trying to juggle script trying to juggle Uber trying to juggle Skip doordash and everything at the same time what's happening is that we have interrupted their traffic pattern of ordering online and US delivering.

And I'm not sure we're ever going to get it back I don't think we're ever going to get back to the $30 not because there's no money there in the table but because we have drivers for the exact reason of you complaining and bitching at me is if I have unreasonable expectations and looking at the rating system and on reasonable expectations as if somehow I'm going to be fine for Skippers has nothing to do with it I want to get back to at least $30 an hour at least $40 an hour maybe even $50 an hour.

I understand a lot of people here in this form may not have any job experience and I understand you may not have any sales of marketing experience but this was an opportunity we could have turned into integrating ourselves in society that they would need us just to get food because most people are lazy.

Look many people they are hooked to fast food okay that is just the way it is they will have food right in their fridge that is perfectly edible that was saved them $20 but they're emotionally depressed right now there's a lot of s*** going on in the world they're upset they need to pick me up.

Hey there alone and their couch with their cats they were toxic and couldn't get along with their man and now they're sitting there and they're depressed and I don't know what to do in life so they reach their phone and they order them a Sunday and they didn't know what they do is they pay six bucks for delivery for this $4 Sunday and then they tip $4 thank you very much.

But when you don't use a bag and that $4 Sunday shows up half melted the next time they go to feed their internal suffering and emotional lack and they're going to give you money they don't order.

Most people have lots of food they're not ordering skip because they need food they're ordering skip because emotionally they're having issues because they're hungry they because they they didn't have time to make a meal and making a meal a loan at the table reminds them of their pathetic lonely boring life.

So what I'm asking am I fellow drivers is to placate them and grab your bag and bring it into the restaurant and do the show play the game and then bring it to their house and say there you go you have a nice evening and they can go back into the couch and watch their movies or their soap operas whatever they're watching and they can eat their Sunday before it's melted and they'll order again tomorrow night because their life is emotionally lacking and they are probably depressed and we're going to help bring some Sundays to them so they feel better about their life.

There should not be one driver on this form that would even respond to me one criticism or one complaint or one note that says I shouldn't be looking at the reading system when you're making less than $50 an hour.

And the process is simple if you're working Dash or you working skipping the same time and you get to skip you pause your dash yes I understand it takes you out of the queue you can re-enable it when you are a kilometer away from your delivery.

So yes I'm opinionated yes I do have the opinion that people are being lazy yes I do feel it is affecting me because I'm part of the business and I can move on and do something different fine and I probably will pretty soon anyway but my simple point is there should not be one person on this form bitching about me because I want to talk about bags because you're not making 50 bucks an hour and we know it's there we know it's possible and we need to get back there.",0,1735599980.0,skipthedishes,9,0.18,False

""My dearest Drea,

My hope is that someday, it’s you who discovers this letter. Adrian can be impulsive and unpredictable, and I have no idea what he might do in the future.

Drea, my little spark, my strength—I wish I’d had more time to see you grow, to be there for you. You are my heart, my sunshine, and please, always remember that. There’s so much I want to say, but time has grown scarce; I can feel it slipping away. My health is failing quickly, and it’s not by accident.

You deserve to know, Drea, that the reason for my failing health is Vivian—your mother. I wanted so badly for our marriage to work, wanted to share everything with her. But she only cared about my fortune, and she’s gone to great lengths to secure it for herself.

My estate belongs solely to you and Adrian. I wanted to make this clear in a will, but I never expected time to run out this way. I’ve long suspected Vivian was tainting my drinks, but today, I’m certain. She brought me coffee not long ago, and there, faintly on the cup’s rim, were traces of a familiar poison. I could call the police or rush to the hospital, but instead, I choose to write to you now, hoping you find this someday, hidden here in your nursery.

If things go as I hope, David may look after you, maybe even adopt you, though he doesn’t know of you yet. If not, I pray Adrian finds you and keeps you safe. I believe you’ll grow into a remarkable woman, strong and resilient, Drea. Know that I loved you fiercely. Please tell Adrian that despite his anger over my choices, I’m deeply sorry and that I love him as well.

I love you both,

\~Emerson Grant""

The letter slipped from Drea’s trembling fingers, her legs giving way. Sorin quickly wrapped an arm around her shoulders, holding her upright as she crumpled into his side.

Tears blurred her vision, and through them, she looked up at Sorin, whose expression held a quiet grief. Though he was only a child back then, his affection for his uncle had been real.

She managed to choke out, “W-what does this mean?”

""Shh,"" Sorin soothed her, bending to pick up the letter and carefully slipping it into her book. “Not here, not now. Let’s get home, then we can talk.”

She nodded, her lips trembling as tears spilled over. Sorin gently wiped them away, wrapped an arm around her waist, and guided her out of the room. They descended the stairs quietly, moving toward the exit.

Just as they reached the door, her mother’s shrill voice called after them, “Leaving already? You haven’t stayed for lunch.”

Sorin’s jaw clenched tightly. Murderous woman, he thought, before turning to face her with a forced smile. “I’d rather have lunch alone with my wife. Thanks.” With that, he steered Drea out the door.

Once they were safely away, he pulled the car to a stop by the side of the road, dropping his head against the steering wheel. “Damn it, damn it, damn it.”

A soft touch settled over his hand, gripping the wheel tightly. Lifting his head, he found Drea’s gaze, shimmering with unshed tears as she tried to hold them back.

“D-do you… think this could really be true?” Her voice trembled with uncertainty.

He reached for the book and retrieved the letter, directing her gaze to its signature. “Look, he signed it. If we can track down some old documents he might’ve signed, we’ll have proof.” He paused, deep in thought. “Dad must have something lying around.” A loud groan escaped him as he pinched the bridge of his nose, tears gathering in his eyes. “Why did my uncle have to be so reckless? He could’ve at least confided in my father and asked for his help! Damn it!”

Drea intertwined her fingers with his, offering a comforting squeeze. “We… we don’t really know what was going on back then…”

A sob erupted from him. “I loved him so much, Drea. I don’t remember everything, but I know I did. To learn he met such a tragic end…”

Leaning forward, Drea rested her forehead against his bicep, weeping alongside him. He lowered his chin onto her head, tears streaming down his cheeks as they sought solace in one another’s embrace.

After several moments, he wiped his eyes and said, “Call Adrian. Tell him to meet us at home.”

Drea nodded as Sorin drove away. When they arrived, Adrian sat at the dining table, his head bowed and hands gripping his hair in despair, the letter sprawled before him.

Taking a seat beside him, Drea wrapped her arm around him, offering comfort while Sorin stood back, his mind racing as he contemplated their next steps. Grief could wait; justice for his uncle was their immediate priority, and Sorin vowed he wouldn’t rest until it was served.

Suddenly, Adrian shot up from his seat, his eyes bloodshot and wild. He pulled out his pistol from the holster at his waist, making Drea gasp softly in shock.

“That’s it! That woman is going to pay today. I’ve tolerated her long enough!” He growled, striding toward the door. Drea grasped his wrist, desperately trying to halt him.

“Adrian, no!”

# Great Powers and Small States

***West Africa***

HiC back here again! TFO's West Africa, on the surface level, is in a relatively similar position to West Africa in TNO - split between a pan-African power (the West African Union) and an alliance of American-backed, conservative and authoritarian regimes (the African Cooperation Community), after the West African War ended in a stalemate. However, this would obscure the great deal of change that has taken place since the TNO time period. Free France, once a giant of the continent, has long since shattered, with its remnants being scattered across West Africa serving as advisors to the various pro-Western governments in the Community. The Ivory Coast stands as the dominant economy and military power of the Community under the reign of Félix Houphouët-Boigny, using its wealth to back a swathe of friendly regimes and rebel movements - yet as the 80s lumber on, that economic power may shatter, and other nations in the Cooperation, such as Senegal and Liberia, eagerly covet its position. The West African Union, too, has arguably drifted far from its earlier incarnations. The fires of liberatory warfare have faded, and the realities of ruling have settled in - although many within the WAU seek to rekindle the old liberatory sentiments - or see them snuffed out entirely.

  
***South Africa***

South Africa in TFO stands on the biggest crossroads since the start of the South African War and the Boer uprising under Albert Herzog. The Union of South Africa is nearing its next general elections, and as the hegemon of Southern Africa, should the tune set by Cape Town change, the dance of nations there may well collapse. 

Inside South Africa, one can on the surface find a relatively stable country under the firm control of the United Party and the country’s current prime minister [Radcylffe Cadman](https://imgur.com/NYG4HCQ). But scrape that surface off and you will find a myriad of problems that may cause the national boiler to burst. The UP has managed to kick the can called “racial equality” to the end of the road and now for the first time the people of South Africa will need to make their stances on it clear. 

The reality of South Africa can be seen most clearly in terms of its foreign policy. Controlling a vast web of “friendly and equal” countries like [Botswana ](https://imgur.com/ft5dEg5)and [Zimbabwe-Rhodesia](https://imgur.com/pZeYEUs) and burning the nations they cannot control through the use of mere bandits in rebels' skin, such as the [Zambian PFACD](https://imgur.com/aOwB7zt), they will do all in their power to curtail the spread of dangerous socialist and pan-African ideas on their side of the equator, no matter how many nations they must shatter to do so.

  
***The East African Federation***

You already know the drill! Big Weld here again. This section is kind of personal, as the East African Federation in TFO was born out of a submod for TNO I had created two years ago with a talented team, titled Great Powers and Small States. Integrated into TFO by the tail-end of 2023, GPSS has evolved into an iconic part of TFO and one I'm proud to have led. As recently shown in our [starting situation teaser a few months ago](https://imgur.com/a/ZKguHI7), by 1980, after the collapse of the East African Transitional Authority, Oscar Kambona's dominant-party state had filled the void left by the OFN. [As the emerging regional power faces threats from Madagascar and the encroachments by the WAU into Central Africa](https://imgur.com/a/bRGsmaZ), the nascent Republic faces an inflection point by the start of the 1980s with [new elections to succeed Oscar Kambona](https://imgur.com/a/2oo9FI3) and a crossroads as to its allegiance on the international stage.

***The United States of Brazil***

Hello everyone, the Supreme Leader of Brazil Emmy here. It's Christmas time! (**Editor's Note: It was, in fact, not Christmas time.**) When I first came up with [TFO Brazil's starting situation](https://imgur.com/a/rkTgsfG) and [successors](https://imgur.com/a/N2X1M34), I thought it would be just that, skeleton content, nothing more, nothing less. How wrong was I... because me and Pedro have been busy cooking up a little story about a country plagued by corruption, a vice-president which will try everything to seize the big chair and the five possible candidates that will attempt to get into office in the upcoming election. All meanwhile the President enters desperation as the clock ticks closer to midnight.

What happened in Brazil during the 60s can be described as a political catastrophe. As he returned to the Presidency, Juscelino Kubitschek quickly found himself in trouble as news of possible corruption in his megaprojects became a rallying cry of the opposition. These opposing voice quickly grew to become the main thing people knew about JK - that he was a corrupt bastard. In a remarkably close impeachment vote, JK was removed from office. In his place, Edna Lott would have to command a broken nation.

The midterm elections came, and it was a disaster for the PTB-PSD coalition, with the PSP and the UDN gaining a huge majority of the seats in the Senate. Any piece of legislation she wanted to pass failed, any piece of legislation she didn't want it to pass had their veto overridden. Political chaos ensued, and this was fertile ground for an opportunist such as Vargas Jr. to appear and dominate the narrative. Vargas Jr. was elected in 1970 and quickly drew comparisons between him and his father. He proclaimed the days of massive spending were over and that the days of true progress had returned. He managed to get his monster - the re-election amendment - passed and so, was elected again in '75.

On Christmas Eve, 1980, as most people were sharing gifts and singing carols something happened: papers describing the massive embezzlement scheme Vargas Jr. was doing leaked to the press. The people woke up to a fiery Christmas, all news channel were attacking the President. His vice-president - Ulysses Guimarães - was perhaps one of his most vocal opponents. Protests, some of the largest the nation had ever seen, erupted in the streets of Rio, São Paulo and Brasilia. Articles of Impeachment were introduced in the Chamber as the New Year arrived. [The end of Vargas Jr.'s reign was coming and he would not be saved](https://imgur.com/a/2ooFGxZ).

***The Argentinian Confederation and its Sphere***

Hello everyone, and Happy New Year! I am veneco, the Lead Developer of The Fading Order (not really) and Argentina. As we settle into the colder climate of this southern land, it's clear that **Argentina has emerged victorious in the South American Cold War** against its northern neighbor, Brazil. One by one, **the Latin American nations of Uruguay, Chile, Paraguay, and Santa Cruz have succumbed to the influence of Buenos Aires**. In essence, Brazil has lost its standing, while Argentina has soared like a condor, establishing itself as the dominant power in the Southern Cone and posing a significant challenge to U.S. interests in South America.

After Frondizi's tumultuous presidency ended amid pressure from the Colorados, Guido stepped in, seemingly to rescue Argentine democracy. However, this was merely a temporary setback to its death. The Frente Nacional, an unholy coalition of Frondizists and Peronists, emerged and claimed victory over Palacios’ Unión Democrática. The PCP faction of the FN managed to overpower the UCRI (D), leading to Solano Lima's provisional presidency until Juan Domingo Perón’s inevitable return to power.

As Perón increasingly embraced the fascist elements of Peronism, the 1969 Economic Crisis culminated in the assassination of his protégé, José Ignacio Rucci, at the hands of Montoneros. A widespread campaign of repression engulfed the nation during this tumultuous period. The struggle for succession to become Perón’s Vice President plunged the halls of power into tension, ultimately resulting in Manuel de Anchorena receiving Perón’s blessing. Although Carlos Saúl Menem initially attempted to challenge this decision after Perón's death, he now lies buried three feet underground.

As Anchorena solidified his grip on power, the Argentine Confederation was restored, ushering in a national socialist traditional Catholic dictatorship that aligned Argentina with Nazi Germany. As Argentina enters this new golden era, one must ponder its future ambitions. Will it set its sights on Bolivia, Peru, or even the Caribbean? Or perhaps, it will focus on consolidating its claims closer to home, of a stolen land centuries ago? One thing is certain: the Southern Cone has become a significant headache for the OFN in The Americas - a situation that shows no signs of changing anytime soon.

***The Republic of Peru***

Hi, this is Pedro the Peruvian Pigeon, also known as Pedro. I work as a designer in TNO for the Latin America team, and for TFO I am the lead for both Peru and Chile. Some of you might have already seen [the starting situation leak for Peru](https://imgur.com/a/n3A5f44), but the situation of Chile have yet to be revealed. I'll use this brief diary to explore the starting situation of both countries, and to show what they will be up to during the mod.

Peru in TFO diverges from TNO in its lore, as Odría is elected in the 1963 elections following the institutional coup by the army in 1962. Odría's term would end abruptly after General Velasco Alvarado couped him in 1968 after he tried to dissolve congress to avoid an impeachment vote. The revolutionary Junta would implement the long-awaited agrarian reform and enjoy initial popularity, but as Velasco retired due to bad health, the revolution lost steam. By 1980, it has completely been defeated, with new elections soon to occur.

As hopeful as the return of democracy might be, all is not well for the Andean nation. Large inequality still exists in the nation between the capital and the rest of the country, and the economy has lagged behind. But that's just the tip of the Iceberg, as Peru is entrapped in another conflict with Ecuador over the disputed territories over the Amazon. With half of the guarantors of the treaty of Rio de Janeiro being fascist dictatorships, the US and Brazil have both an interest in avoiding any escalation between both countries. Wishes of peace and cooperation do not secure borders, and as tensions rise between both countries, [Peru's democracy begins its first trial](https://imgur.com/a/cp7rjD7). 

***The Republic of Chile***

When Allende was elected president in 1964, he promised reform and a better life. That promise would be left unkept, as General Viaux, with the backing of nationalist groups, sections of the armed forces and the MRNS, couped the government in what would be known as ""The Tacnazo"". Now, 11 years after the coup, and Chile is completely unrecognizable to the one in the past. Viaux, now ruling a fascist dictatorship as president after stepping down from the Junta in 1975, has stomped any opposition to his government with surgical precision.

At the start of TFO, Viaux and his coalition of nationalists and fascists are working on a crucial step to finally solidify's Viaux control over the country: a new constitution. However, as differences between each faction become apparent, Viaux has the task of balancing the needs and demands of his allies with his own goals and interests as he prepares to finally put the final nail in the coffin of the old order and begin a new era, one of nationalism, order, and most importantly, obedience. While we work on giving you Chile's starting situation, take a look at [Viaux's new portrait coming in the demo](https://imgur.com/a/6cisH4k).

***The Kingdom of the Netherlands***

Hello everyone! My name is Munt, or as most of you know me, Señor Guevara. While I usually serve as the Localisation Lead for TFO, this time I decided to step outside my comfort zone. Together with Big Weld, we took on the challenge of designing the plot for my home country of the Netherlands, now exiled to its last remaining colony, Suriname.

Suriname—or as it is still officially referred to by the ruling minority, the Kingdom of the Netherlands—has been in a state of pseudo-dictatorship since the 1971 Royal Netherlands Army Coup. This coup was an unprecedented moment in Dutch history, as it was the first time the military intervened to depose an elected government. The civilian administration had been on the verge of caving to intense pressures from the native Surinamese population to grant independence to the colony. In response, the army stepped in, seizing power, halting the independence movement in its tracks.

The coup saw Prime Minister Jo Meynen replaced by Hermann van Roijen, who, with the military’s blessing, established a non-partisan coalition to govern Suriname. This alliance consists of banned-party politicians, influential figures from business and industrial circles, and most importantly the Royal Netherlands Army, which holds the ultimate authority in the new regime. In this fragile arrangement, the civilian government retains only as much power as the military is willing to grant, making the army the true dealer of power in the exiled kingdom.

The 1980s will bring the misplaced Kingdom and its people to their greatest trial yet, threatening the very existence of the true Netherlands for the third time in nearly 50 years. With that, [we present the starting situation of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1980](https://imgur.com/a/tF8FUFr). 

***Cáncer de los Trópicos*** 

Pjero and Big Weld here, co-leads of the Caribbean. For the past month in honor of leakmas, we've been teasing [the starting situation ](https://imgur.com/a/SvkkKwf)and enormous series of events occurring the Caribbean, showcasing how America is on the backfoot in the region. As we enter into the second to last decade of the 20th century the islands of Caribbean stand at a political precipice. From the halls of Havana, Castro can be heard talking about revolution and liberty under the Vanguardist banner. At the same time in Santo Domingo Joaquin Balaguer stands out as a continuous thorn for the battered Veracruz Pact and a drifting ally of the valiant OFN, a stark reminder that liberty cannot always prevail. Haiti has stabilized significantly over the last two centuries and the presidency of Alix Pasuqet is a calm, yet revanchist one.

On the shores of Lesser Antilles one can find a myriad of ideologies can be found, from the despotic and personalistic rule of Eric Gairy to a progressive Noirist government of Aime Cesaire. Down south in the jungles of Suriname and in streets of Paramaribo a vestige of the old Europe can be found still clutching onto life not knowing its time has long passed away.

Yet in the air there is still this unease. Like a cancer that is slowly metastasizing, untraceable, [not unwilling to show its ugly face](https://imgur.com/a/FSU5MyX) to the doctors. [But soon enough its signs of rot and decay will show and the Caribbean will be faced with a tremendous challenge](https://imgur.com/a/jKYsfGc).

Regardless of which way the winds blow in the Caribbean, it could very well begin the exercise of Fascism from Latin America, the entrenchment and spread of it, or birth a new form of leftist revolution across the region. It is up to you, the player, to determine the death or continuance of the Monroe Doctrine.

***Central America***

Hello again everyone, this time I, Cheetos, will be in charge of [introducing the situation of the convulsive region of Central America by 1980](https://imgur.com/a/MwhaUkB), a region that historically has been characterized by having constant coups, rises and falls of historical “caudillos” and many wars.

In TFO, the entire region diverges from what we have seen in TNO, with such key events taking place as the Football War over a decade ago that ended with the victory of the Republic of El Salvador and the collapse of the Republic of Honduras as it was known, the latter of which after two failed juntas finds itself under the rule of Colonel Francisco Ruiz Andrade. On the other side of the border, ""the thumb of the Americas"" stands as the most prosperous country in the region, experiencing an unprecedented economic miracle only where foreign companies, and coffee and industrial oligarchies are truly benefited. 

To the north, one of the few democratic bastions persists against rising authoritarianism, with the Christian Democrats in power under René de León Schlotter, who is now preparing for a new electoral cycle amid economic crisis. Nicaragua presents an interesting case, where the Somoza dynasty has survived challenges, evident in Anastasio Somoza Debayle, who has solidified family control and even managed to influence the region 

Lastly, Costa Rica is experiencing its first years of democracy in decades after the slow collapse of the Calderonista regime. This change has allowed former supporters of Figueres Ferrer to restructure the National Liberal Party for a potential comeback. While the young democracy is consolidating, challenges remain that could lead to a return to authoritarianism.

# The Home Of The Brave

***Canada***

Sunfaded here again, I would like to turn us towards the Commonwealth, and to bring our eyes to the Dominion of Canada still clutching onto her vast array of rocks across the Pacific and Atlantic. In line with this, Canada has undergone a complete rework, one that I think was very much needed (**don't worry all, Jack Horner will still feature, Horner endures, The Tory Cowboys Endure, etc etc**) however I think, with a lot more thought, a far more detailed and thought-out route has been prepared. 

As Canada enters the 1980s it ends a decade of nation building, in which Canada, so long a nation searching for character in the vast snowy wastes, has proven herself to have one quite distinct. Over the last decade Canada has been defined by Allan MacEachan, of the Liberal Party of Canada, the Godfather of modern Canada and the architect of her reinvigorates welfare state and housing development. In a stark contrast to the great blue whale to her South, Canada has gone to almost the inverse, consistently finding herself in closer partnership with her southern neighbor, but deeper disagreements that have estranged the two, as overlap between the Commonwealth and Organisation of Free Nations continues to cause disagreements and tension. 

As for the remnants of the British Empire that lay torn and tattered across the globe - Canada finds herself the Jewel in the Crown of the bespeckled Commonwealth. Stretching from the Union of South Africa to her South, New Zealand in her far-flung reaches, Jamaica in her tropics, Guyana in her minds eye. Though all answer to one Queen for now, with the increasing distance from the empire once in London and the new one in Ottawa, the meaning of the Commonwealth has increasingly found itself faded with Australia departing only a few years previously, shall what once held the globe in her fingertips die with a roar, or with a whimper.

Of all her rocks though Canada finds herself clinging onto one in particular - The Falkland Islands. As Canada find yourself entering a nation at the end of a era - with the retirement of Allan MacEachan questioning whom rules the nation at home, Canada will be brought into question on the world stage as well as Argentina and Canada battle for the fate of the islands in general. As the Canadian electorate battle themselves three parties take the stand to lead not just a nation, but an empire. Choose from the Cooperative Commonwealth, Progressive Conservative Party or Liberal Party of Canadian in a election that may define each of their histories and fight a battle to keep a dream alive, the Commonwealth, the Empire and Canada herself.

In the next month I hope to release a glimpse into the reworked situation of Canada, the election of 1981 and the Falklands War itself showing a glimpse of what is to come and introducing the Commonwealth of Nations into the increasingly sizzling Cold War. Alongside this, expect to see more of the Commonwealth upon the world stage, all of course, from Ottawa herself.

***The United States of Mexico***

Good day everyone, it is I, the Mexicube. [Last month we introduced you to the starting situation of Mexico](https://imgur.com/a/Mp5Cijd). As a result of the events in the 1960s, Gustavo Díaz Ordaz came to power and was eventually followed by Luis Echeverría Álvarez and Porfirio Muñoz Ledo. Echeverría, after the economy under his management started falling apart, chose Porfirio Muñoz Ledo as a scapegoat for his mistakes. This backfired, as the new management under the populist leader saw a cut in corruption and a prioritization in social programs, somewhat diminishing the effects of the economic crisis, and with the discovery of new oil fields in Campeche, the new funds came to lift Mexico enough to our current situation.

[The three main factions ](https://imgur.com/a/bT87wtQ)within the PRI are the Corriente Democrática, under Porfirio Muñoz Ledo and Jesus Reyes Heroles, who could be called either populists who want to please the people or reformists who seek to bring democracy to the nation; the Technocrats, under Miguel de la Madrid and José López Portillo, who seek to open the nation to investors and the Free World, and Jorge Serrano with the megacorps, leading the Dinosaurs, Nationalists or Old Guard, who seek centralize the power again, as well as to bring Mexico to the First World, no matter the cost.

***The United States of America***

Let's do this one last time. Big Weld here, lead for the U.S. Lots of things have changed for the U.S. as we've embraced the new lore we have set up (sorry TFO US fans, still can't give out a whole lot of details until a separate diary!). Needless to say, much of the first dev diary, barring Romney himself and the events that occurred, is outdated. 

[The United States in the Fading Order takes a much, darker turn compared to its preceding iteration](https://imgur.com/a/UAUz9AU). The New Deal's corpse is bloated, and the minds of Americans across the country are exhausted with the status quo that has dominated their lives for the last 20 years. As a 7-2 conservative court reigns and has stalled any sense of reform in the country on the national level, the Romney administration chugs along soundly as he enters his waning years amidst a controversial election season in 1980 that may prove to be a continuance of Responsible Republican leadership under Donald Rumsfeld, the last hope of liberalism in the United States under Edward Kennedy, or our worst excesses under Ronald Reagan and John Connally, all the while third parties may attempt to intervene in the process...

Over the course of the last year, our revamped U.S. situation has also opened up more gameplay interactions regarding the institutions you will be using, and the personnel you'll be interacting with. From [the territories](https://imgur.com/a/b9FAqcM), [to your own cabinet](https://imgur.com/a/f61LWGg), to [those in the senate](https://imgur.com/a/kL45uEG), and even [old friends](https://imgur.com/a/HdQttk0). All of this and more will be yours to interact with in our demo, By Dawn's Early Light.

# The End

And with that, I thank you all for bearing through this. While I do have some[ other things](https://imgur.com/a/X88B3DJ) tied to ODF that I wish I could showcase, those will have to wait for another day. I cannot thank every single member of our team, and those who have helped us along the way, enough for putting this together and the tremendous work to bring this community the closest thing to a sequel to The New Order.

**We're excited to show you what's in store for you next year, as we approach By Dawn's Early Light with content from 1980-1985 for the United States, Germany, Brazil, and others.**

Have a great new year's!
