1ga5asa,https://www.reddit.com/r/preschool/comments/1ga5asa/cockroach/,Cockroach? ,"Hi, I am here because I wanted to voice my thoughts on something I think I saw yesterday when I picked up my son from Pre-K. His school is mixed preschool and pre-K. Anyway, when we were heading out the door, I believe I spotted what looked to be a cockroach. 

I noticed there are a few cobwebs on the stairs going upstairs (not where the preschool is, though). The building is pretty old. It‚Äôs a church. Not saying that all churches are old, but just wanted to include the fact that his preschool is on the bottom level of a church. 

I want to add that I don‚Äôt fully know all of what is done during school hours although my son was able to tell me the general routine. I‚Äôd ask him his lows and highs. He says everything is high. He likes school. He‚Äôs already grown quite a bit and working on his numbers and writing his name. He‚Äôs even getting better at playing with his peers rather than enlisting his two teachers to play with him. We do get feedback on how he‚Äôs doing when we pick him up and there‚Äôll be a parent-teacher conference, too which I am looking forward to. Everything is going great, but after seeing the critter on my way out, I am beginning to question the cleanliness of the place. It seems clean and orderly. 

They requested us parents to bring a water bottle for our child(ren) to keep at the school and then take home at the end of the week (it‚Äôs only three days a week he goes to school). We haven‚Äôt had it returned to bring back. I do plan on asking his teachers about it today. 

My other thought on this critter matter is that the church has done a parents‚Äô night out thing, where parents can drop off their kids for a few hours while the parents can get time to themselves. My boys had a wonderful time. When I picked them up, they were working on making candle holders with molding clay. 
Anyway, seeing the critter today made me wonder how clean their kitchen upstairs really is. Upstairs is where the kids play when the weather isn‚Äôt favorable for outdoor play. That‚Äôs where they had the parents‚Äô night out thing. I am going to coffee hour with my youngest in the morning after I drop off my son. I plan to keep an eye out for any more critters or signs of them. 

I also plan to somehow discreetly make his teachers aware, or at least the church folks, of what I saw‚Äîexpressing my concern. I don‚Äôt want to alarm other parents until what I saw is confirmed and am assured it will be taken care of. 

Anyway, what do you think? Am I approaching this okay? Do I have reason to be concerned other than the critter matter?",1,1729670868.0,preschool,0,1.0,False

My issue is my grandad. I love him so much but he is very traditional and homophonic. For instance, he started yelling at a male barista because he put a heart on his coffee, he was yelling how up he isn‚Äôt gay and he didn‚Äôt like being hit on. I don‚Äôt want to go on holiday because of the way he acts, he constantly tells me to stop eating because I‚Äôm getting fat, that I can‚Äôt sit how I was because it wasn‚Äôt lady like, I couldn‚Äôt wear shorts because it made him uncomfortable. He yelled at me because me and my younger brother were at an arcade, won a prize and I joked that it was all mine (something we and my brother had agreed on because we were splitting our prizes evenly). He called m a selfish, disgusting person and how horrible I was. He screamed at me for ten minutes and I was in tears, he wasn‚Äôt even sorry just said that my nanna would get mad at him for yelling at me.

I really don‚Äôt want to go because I want to spend my school break with my friends and doing school work (I have a week break). I politely declined saying I have a lot of schoolwork, which is true, but they should have fun and that I loved them millions. My dad(55) doesn‚Äôt like when I say no because I should go with them , I owe it to them and I‚Äôm selfish for not wanting to spend time with them.

This week I hit 2 months sober. I will say the first month was hardest for me. It felt like a bit of a no man‚Äôs land, not yet feeling like I earned the ‚Äòsober‚Äô badge and that I could easily drink again and reset the clock.

Month 2 is where I felt more solid, and actually felt benefits. I noticed my mood had been so much more stable, I was more level headed and honestly just happier!

I‚Äôve been on a couple of weekends away with girlfriends, dinners and drinks etc. so my social life hasn‚Äôt suffered. It felt amazing to be the first one up in the morning, full of energy and excited to start each day.

The only area I‚Äôve found challenging is the dinner dates, which I‚Äôve learned I should try and request an earlier reservation and don‚Äôt fight a late night coffee. When my friends are drinking wine at a restaurant they could sit chatting until the early hours of the morning - tough going for a sleepy sober person!

1ga50ea,https://www.reddit.com/r/prozac/comments/1ga50ea/20_to_40mg_2_week_update/,20 to 40mg: 2 week update,"I noticed quite a few people have been posting about upping their dose, especially from 20/30 to 40. I have been on 20mg for three years and due to recent unavoidable increase in stressors, I upped from 20 to 40 on Oct 10, so two weeks ago. 

I take my dose at 7:30am. 

Week 1
Day 1-2 started off a little shaky‚Äînausea, insomnia, and mild diarrhea started immediately. 

Day 3-5 were the best days, feeling very positive, motivated, enjoying my favorite music and singing along. Still had insomnia, nausea, loss of appetite, and toilet issues but despite that, I felt great mentally and emotionally. 

Day 6-7 was a bad crash‚Äîmorning depression and anxiety hit, and the physical side effects still going strong. Emotionally hollow, empty, tired, felt like giving up. 

Week 2
Nearly all bad days except for 1 average day. Terrible morning depression/anxiety that decreases to a flat, blank, unmotivated state throughout the day. Cannot bring myself to get anything productive done. Also fatigue was worse‚Äîbeen taking mid morning naps. 

What keeps me going is looking at my notes from 2021 when I first started 20mg. I was having more down than up days until week 4, and only really showed consistent improvement from week 6. 

Even though the last two weeks have been rough, I think the severity of the side effects from increasing are still less than the first time I started 20mg. Back then the bad days were all day long; now it hits worse in the morning but eases from the afternoon and I‚Äôm usually fairly leveled out by the evening. 

The hardest thing is the morning depression and waking up at 4-5am and being unable to go back to sleep. it‚Äôs a real struggle to get out of bed and I‚Äôm so tired in the morning until my cup of coffee in the early afternoon. 

I hope this provides some useful info for others who are going through the same phase. I will try to update again in a couple of weeks.",1,1729669850.0,prozac,0,1.0,False

Lyrics 1:
dust been thrown on my body 
originality over any copy 
fear like some bitter coffee 
better cop me a gun 
before the cops gun me down 
handcuffs, got me planted on the ground 
what a murderous planet I found 
let the dark spirit come in 
I'm too tired of runnin 
sinnin,kickin 
waiting for the dark thoughts to get darker 
take full effect when I feel like a defect
dessect my eyes
 for from the truth I'm already blind 
anger livid of how others live it 
mischief, on to edge of my cliff 
load my clip, as I look at my stick 
make me more sick... headed 
on where I'm headed 
for darkness embedded 
as im soon to be beheaded 
the knives who cut me
say there the knives who love me 



Lyrics 2:
body shivering 
body blisters 
from the mister 
the whip missed ya 
Gave me a few purple kisses 
the most affection I ever had 
the lip stick gave me a infection
inspection, hide trauma and tears in the bottle of empty beers 
reality got beaten by fear 
for windows unclean, can't see clear 
 depend on  there ear and what they hear 
many reps of good reputation
get you your ovation 
word of the street your authentication 
public figures, get you bigger, get you another bank figure 
you make me more sicker, your last one was the kicker, I'm a madman with a trigger 
*gun shot* I just popped the mister 
for those wounds became forever scars
got new ones from the guards
sentenced for life behind the bars
lost touch with reality, I can't make sense 
life getting harder to swallow, more and more dense
alienated me Like ET
chain around the guards neck 
shaking like he got ET 
burned footage on the cctv
his body fell as blood spill from his neck 
more red on the red canvas 
growing number of politicians 
more actors on the red carpet

I know everyone has been dying for details and until I get a chance to take photos, I'll describe it as best I can.  The building used to be a single-family home.  Most of the walls were removed so it's 900 square feet is split into 3 large rooms & one teeny tiny little half bath and a second story.  The upstairs is small, but definitely a useable space.  I'm going to have my office upstairs with all of my (extremely bulky, very VERY heavy) equipment.  Good thing J has been hitting the gym! ü§£  That still leaves about half of the upstairs open.  I'm thinking maybe that will be for sale & clearance items.  Anyone have any suggestions?

I'm picturing a rustic meets glam theme.  I think I've got a good start: an armchair & side table for the dressing room area, an antique hutch and antique oak pedestal table to serve as a fixtures.  I picked up some super fluffy white shaggy rugs and gauzy lace curtains for the windows. For my office I had to get anew desk & office chair.  I also got a laptop for the store (can't just leave the home laptop there!).  I got 4 full-legnth frameless mirrors-the kind with the beveled edges.  They're soooo beautiful!  They add a touch of sparkle abd brighten up the 'back' room.  I also got an antique door & a rustic wooden wire spool.  It was a bit of a splurge, but when I saw a tufted, white burlap sette, I KNEW I just HAD to have it!  

I also got a 2 chandliers: one for the entryway and one for the cash register area. ü©∑  I wanted an area to have coffee & cookies, so I found a refinished hutch on Marketplace.  Another splurge at $500, but don't tell J! Lol

I also got a keurug with a selection of coffees, and a mini-fridge for bottled water.  I still need a few things, but should be able to get everything in 3-4 more outings.

I hope to have the store open in about 8 weeks.  I've got stands & displays to make (well, my DAD has stands & displays to make.  Thank you Dad! ü©∑)  With my craft fair just 4 weeks away, I've got a LOT to do!

**Who am I?**

* *26-year-old white male from the land of kangaroos and coffee (Melbourne, Australia).*
* *Standing tall at 6‚Äô0‚Äù (183cm) with a slim, athletic build. Think of me as a lean, mean trivia machine (more on that later).*
* *I‚Äôm an associate lawyer with a Law/Science degree, so I can help you win arguments‚Äîor at least tell you when you‚Äôre winning them.*
* *I‚Äôm passionate about a million things, so boredom is never an option.*

**What I‚Äôm into:**

* *Learning new things‚ÄîI‚Äôve even been on TV for a trivia show!*
* *Socialising and meeting new people. The more, the merrier (unless they‚Äôre the type who talks excessively during movies).*
* *Sports‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs kicking a soccer ball around or hitting the tennis courts, I‚Äôm game.*
* *Adventures‚Äîhiking, museum hopping, or spontaneous road trips? Sign me up!*
* *Movies‚Äîaction and comedy are my jam, but I‚Äôm open to suggestions.*
* *Creative stuff‚Äîlike graphic design. Who knew being a lawyer could be so artsy?*
* *Staying fit‚ÄîI work out regularly because, hey, someone‚Äôs got to keep the doctors out of business.*

**What I‚Äôm looking for:**

* *A kind and compassionate woman who‚Äôs driven, takes care of herself, and shares a non-religious outlook on life.*

30F, 69.6kg and 158cm height. Want to reduce belly fat and stay lean. 

My trainer has given me the below diet chart to lose weight and I‚Äôm not sure if its right. 

History or the background: 
I‚Äôve been taking PT since August and not a kg has lost. I also included 1000skips a day for 5-6 days each week. I follow my own diet where I take vegetables+fish+egg for lunch and soups for dinner. I also did intermittent fasting 16:8, 18:6 and 20:4. 

Now My job shift doesn‚Äôt allow me for a breakfast or let me follow IF. 
2.5 months in gym and havent lost an inch or kg which is really frustrating and makes me cry. 

In 2021 i did youtube home workouts and lost a good 10kg with same diet as above. 

Current workout schedule at the gym with a PT: 
Workout schedule is: 6 days a week
Upper body*2 or 3 days a week
Legs *1 or 2
Crossfit *2 

2 sets of x weight and the 3rd set with a slight increase foe weighed exercises. 

Train abs on all days except legs, with alternate leg raise, ab crunch, Russian twist & reverse crunch 

Come back home and finish 1000 skips a day. 

I get good 7 to 8 hours sleep from between 2am to 9.30/10am. 

Below is the chart my trainer gave, is this a gpod diet to follow? Im afraid chapathi will be too much of carbs. What do you think/suggest? 
Im thinking my youtube videos were more effective than the gym ones provided i followed my diet. 

Im at a point where I dont know what to do üò≠üòî

1ga4var,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ga4var/i_got_closure_25_years_later_and_it_was_exactly/,I got closure 2.5 years later. And it was exactly what I needed. ,"I see a lot on here about how getting ""closure"" (whatever that means to you) doesn't help. 

Idk. But it my case it did. I will say, however, I have since moved on and am in a very happy relationship now. Despite this, I still found myself going out of my way to avoid her. For 2.5 years I've always wondered what would happen if we were to run into each other again. For awhile, it was in hopes of getting back together. But for much longer, I wondered what she would say/do. 

This feeling is the only thing that stayed through my healing process after that break up. It was rough. I scrolled this sub for HOURS a day at one point. I made so many posts asking for advice (on my main acct). Until it happened, I would think about whether I would run into her at least once a day because we went to the same (large) university, but in very different departments. I avoided her area completely. 

And then I was waiting for the bus, and I saw her sitting 15 feet away from me, clearly waiting for the same bus. I kinda panicked tbh. But I was with a friend and we sat together. I got up to leave and she was just *there* right by the door. We said hello to each other and talked for maybe 30 seconds and I got off the bus. 

And I got home and immediately told my now partner what just happened. Tbh I was relieved and I felt a bit euphoric that night. Then she texted me and wanted to catch up.. we texted for a little bit but it just updating each other on our lives. It was sweet. She was nice to me, and she wanted to get coffee. I turned down the offer. I am so far past that time in my life, and I was really proud of myself for how I responded. 

This was (I think?) 2 weeks ago. And I thought about it a lot over a period of 3 days and suddenly, that feeling of wonder, and the feeling of being on edge if I run into her is just gone. Today I realized I've gone probably over a week without thinking about her. This is probably the first time I have gone this long without thinking about her in a long time. 

So called ""closure"" is exactly what I needed. ",3,1729669194.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

Nothing came of my job search and I was going stir crazy and needed a way to get out of the house (I had no friends in the area so it was just me and my parents there and while they love me and are nice to spend time with in moderation they‚Äôre extremely overbearing and helicoptery and refuse to respect my adulthood) so I let my parents talk me into going back to my Alma mater for a master‚Äôs.

Things seemed fine at first, although the work was much higher quantity and more tedious than what I‚Äôd done undergrad. However, it quickly became clear that the material itself was going to be radically different from undergrad in ways I didn‚Äôt care for at all. These courses seem to be much closer to applied science courses with a political backdrop, with most of the assignments consisting of reading 3-4 20-40 page studies a week and critiquing the nitty gritty of their methodology in some way, as well as doing one of the many, many steps to prep for our final papers.

Then, shit from my personal life blew up out of nowhere. When I moved into my off campus apartment that semester, the person who was supposed to be my roommate fucked off and never came back after his old roommate brought in a flea problem, the fleas resurfaced my 2nd week of classes, I was put in a hotel until they could fumigate the place, and a long chain of events involving me being falsely accused of and arrested for a serious crime ensued from there (I live in one of like two states where if a person complains about you to police the complainant can just go before a judge or magistrate and have you arrested and charged without even an investigation first). Being forced to don the orange jumpsuit for a day and having your phone held by police as ‚Äúevidence‚Äù for a week and a half for shit that you didn‚Äôt do was, well, traumatizing, and I had to move back in with my parents and attend classes on Zoom for a couple weeks until we figured out what to do. My parents were able to get me a good lawyer and this shit‚Äôs pretty close to taken care of now, but it was terrifying at the time and was a constant source of stress my first few weeks.

Just when I thought things were finally starting to settle down, my area gets absolutely bodied by Hurricane Helene and half of town gets flooded. The university shuts down, at first for a week, then two, and that whole time I‚Äôm seeing constant horror stories of people losing their homes, so I assume that school is going to eventually decide to close the whole semester. 

Well, turns out they didn‚Äôt do that and we‚Äôre back after two weeks. Getting back into the flow of things after an unexpected two week break is hard enough, but my internet was wiped out by the storm and STILL hasn‚Äôt been fixed so doing work is much harder now and requires leaving my place. I already had to ask a teacher for an extension on something because of this and he was willing to give it, but he made it clear that he was only willing to make it a one time thing. This week, all of my teachers are kind of cramming in the assignments we missed at once. Tomorrow I have a critical reaction to 4 20-40 page readings, a critical review of a 400-page book, and a 10-source (20-40 page each scholarly articles like the readings) source matrix for my final paper all due. Needless to say, I‚Äôve gotten maybe 9 hours of sleep total this week and I just can‚Äôt do this shit anymore. I tried all day to sit down in a local coffee shop with internet access to get these things taken care of and just couldn‚Äôt motivate myself, constantly distracted myself to take the edge off, and got nothing done. Eventually I just gave up, wrote a long text to my Dad about dropping out, and wrote this. What the hell do I even do at this point?

Barring all of these awful personal coincidences that I‚Äôm choosing to interpret as something up there screaming at me that grad school was a shit idea, I‚Äôm just making myself miserable for a degree I don‚Äôt even rly feel I need because dropping out would piss my parents off, but living with them again would also make me miserable.

Windows update completed an update last night and was restarting. I went to make a coffee whilst it finished the restart. When I got back to my pc no more the 3 minutes later, the screen was black and it looked liked it was about to go into sleep mode. I moved the mouse which woke the pc but the screens did not register any input. After 30 seconds of black screen I forced a shutdown by holding the on button until it shutdown. The 'aorus' led on the motherboard stayed illuminated however. When I powered back on all the fans and led lights were working apart from the 'aorus' led and the pc would not post. I just had a black screen. I then noticed a solid red light on the dram indicator (see pic below). I forced another power down, turned off the psu and unplugged it from the mains before going to bed because I had an early start this morning. Any ideas why windows update would cause this to happen? I have installed several windows update previously and it has always restarted without any issues. Any ideas what the problem might be?

Even day before yesterday Arfeen came to him to ask ration from Avinash, which Vivian denied by saying you all always come to me ration, I am not inventory incharge, go and ask someone else to negotiate with Avinash. 

But yesterday after nominations , shrutika didn't give him single nomination power and kV ,Shilpa expected him to get ration for them ,for which vivian clearly told i will make for the ones who gives me ration so go and ask from Avinash but then KV started gaslighting vivian by saying tu sabka soch ke hi khaayega, kisi ko bhuka nhi rehne dega then Viv said main kuch sochta hu.

Viv went to Avinash to ask for basic ration but chomu Avinash denied stating it's personal because of nominations. He was only giving 1 apple per person but then Viv said give 2 apples per person.. what should have viv done other than that? Ab uske pav pakad ke ye nhi bolta ration de de.. but on the other hand KV and girl gang were mocking viv by saying ' 20 saal bada hoke aise haath karke maangte hue joker lagta' then why did KV go to ask for Apples in the morning and chomu gave 3 apples to him or why did shrutika go to chomu for asking coffee... Don't they look like clown haath phaila ke maangte hue.

Even Nyra and Shehzada went to Avinash and listened to his stupid rants that's why chomu gave ration to them 

First of all ,viv is not Avinash's follower because in voting task the convincing round was cut in which viv and kV both had their own set of arguements with Rajat and Arfeen ,Viv changed his mind when Rajat said wo ration nikalwa dega because Arfeen didn't do anything to get ration being time god.

Viv was the first one to tell Avinash that he was wrong to go personal on someone and he should go to jail.. he was the first one to ask chum if she felt safe or not . When Avinash came back , next day viv made him understand that you can't go personal and they had a long conversation about it. After that , Avinash was behaving nicely with viv so why should Viv burn the bridges with Avinash who has control of ration . If someone is nice to you , you will also reply nicely . If viv would have fought with chomu then no one would have got basic ration also except eisha and Alice .

KV the great always says main turant ration nikalwa lunga but why didn't he? He always asks viv to be mediator and then he and his group says viv doesn't have leadership quality, ask your choosen leader Rajat to get ration for everyone. 

Last week when viv sorted out ration fiasco , none of them credited him for that and even made fun of him to be mediator so why should Viv do charity to those who mock him behind his back ? On that day also,none of the contestants asked him , if he ate or not.. everything is action and reaction, vivian is not here to be doormat of either of the group. He can't scream and fight unnecessarily for footage. 

Shilpa and KV are bitching about Viv since ration fiasco day and they didn't do anything to get ration from Avinash but in the end vivian gets heat from everyone. 

KV and girl gang are biggest hypocrites, they were like oh we would have given ration to everyone but they were the one who made chahat cry on stove issue but no kv and girl gang are god here, they can't do anything wrong.

Shrutika was biased in nomination task and it's fair as she wanted to save her group but they should stop their obsession with viv with their unreal expectations  ",4,1729668356.0,biggboss,5,0.61,False

We dont mind paying naman, sana sinabi sa voucher na we need to pay if may price difference.

walk into the store tell the guy i need to trade in, tells me he cant do a free iphone promotion to put me on my own line because i am already an existing customer on a family plan (idk if this is true). Tell him ill stay on the plan i just need a free iphone and will trade my beat up one in.

anyway i then read yelp and google reviews later that night and my jaw dropped. place is not a company store but an ""authorized dealer"" & has been scamming people for years in a college town. feel terrible for all the stupid kids who have had their phones rummaged thru while they go sip coffee assuming the ""verizon guy"" is doing his job.

1ga4ia5,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/1ga4ia5/i_think_my_boss_has_something_personal_against_me/,I think my boss has something personal against me ,"Hi, this will be a long post because there are so many nuances to this story, but I'll try to be as short as possible.

I started this job 6 months ago. Initially, I was hired to one position, then every month something about my responsibilities would constantly change. To be fair, they weren't giving me more work to do, it was more like my boss didn't know what he wanted from me.

This would happen almost every month, I would go through a mini-training from my colleagues if it was something that they'd been already doing in the company for some time. If not - I had to figure it out on my own. It would always be something new for me, so it would take time to get accustomed to the processes.

As soon as he saw that there were no results over a month, he would switch my responsibilities again. All of that was done with short notice, without any prior discussions about whether I had the necessary skills or knowledge to be even appointed to those projects. Just a simple: ""Here you go, a task for you, I decided you will be responsible for it"", and I would never deny it, on the opposite, I'd view it as a challenge for myself. BUT IT TAKES TIME. For that reason, people have trial periods at work. You can't just change someone's responsibilities every month and expect them to be productive.

Then, there was an issue with my employment. I'm technically a freelancer, but we agreed that I would work 40 hours per week, and he would just pay me for those hours. We even agreed to paid days between ourselves, so it will be fair. When I just started, I barely had any induction, no one explained to me ""the rules"" of the company. I was just assigned a certain number of paid DOs.

During the job interview, I mentioned that I've planned a couple of trips, that are already paid for and those were planned from a year in advance. I made sure to notify him about those, to which he said ""Sure, no problem at all"". Last month, during one of the trips, I get severe COVID. Obv, I need to take some time off to go to tests, checks, etc. and I physically couldn't work with a 102.5F fever. So, I request 3 more days to get better. This is when things started getting heated.

He scheduled a meeting with me to tell me how unserious I am about the job, that I don't follow the rules, that I demand more than any other colleague, and that he doesn't see any initiative from my side. At this point, I just burst out crying over that meeting.

His points were that he pays me more than I actually work. We use this project management system, where you log out time spent on a task, so I would have around 7:45-7:50h every day. I track only the time I spend on a task, if I have a short break to make myself a coffee or take a breath, I just stop it. When I tried to explain that to him, he refused to listen and started referring to the law. In the country where I live, employees are entitled to 30 minutes of paid breaks throughout the day. He even sent me an article where it clearly stated it, however, he kept arguing with me that I have no right to breaks and everyone in the company works that way, so I should too. If I take a short break, I have to work those hours out. Sure, whatever, I agreed.

This month he texted me that I actually have fewer DOs than I thought (just to remind you, he never mentioned how many I have and I assumed it was a standard 20 days, how every employee usually has, and I planned my holidays accordingly). All of those days went to the trips that I INITIALLY discussed with him. I even gave him the dates. So, it would have been the perfect time to tell me about how many DOs we agree on, and how many out of those days when I'm on those trips will be unpaid. I agreed to extract the difference from my salary, then asked to clarify all of the other company rules we have. I was again reminded about the 8h work day. I again try to clarify why I have less than 8h in my timesheet, and that I think it's unfair to bring this up because it's simply a preference of how people track time.  If you start a task, finish it, then start another one, you anyways lose 3-5 minutes to open your documents, find what you need, etc. etc. And you do it multiple times a day. Idk, is my logic irrational?

All of these conversations felt personal, simply because every time I would have a constructive question, he would start telling me that I argue with him when I shouldn't. Like he already formed some sort of opinion about me that he bases all of his judgments on. At this point, I'm afraid to even ask anything related to administrative issues, because I always get looked down upon.

I see him daily checking my work documents, counting my hours, and checking the results. It's just daunting at this point. I feel like he is looking for a mistake to fire me.

Fast forward to today, I saw that he published a job application form for my position around the time we had that big argument. I'm starting to search for a new job. Am I overreacting and this conflict can be resolved?

1ga4h4q,https://www.reddit.com/r/japanlife/comments/1ga4h4q/looking_to_make_my_next_big_step_in_japan/,Looking to make my next big step in Japan,"Hello everyone, I am looking for some advice on my next steps towards improving my life conditions.
Against everybody's expectations, I was able to go to Japan as a student and get a work Visa after only 6 months of studying in Japan. I arrived in Japan in October 2023 with a Japanese level somewhere between N5 and N4, and I managed to pass the N2 in July.

After 6 months of studying, I managed to find a job for a Japanese company (a big company, about 8000 employees). I am extremely grateful, especially considering that I managed to get a 5 YEAR VISA RENEWAL on my first attempt!!! Everyone kept telling me that I'd be lucky to even get 1 year of a working visa, so this came as a shock!!! Only downside is that the job itself doesn't pay very well, so I am planning to look for a better paying job in 2024 in order to put more money in my savings.

With that out of the way, my next big objective is to open my own store in Japan, whether online or physical. I have done some research on how to do it, but I wanted to ask redditors too for some more specific tips and maybe even tips from personal experience.

So far what I have thought are:

-opening a hobby shop: this is the idea that sounds the most fun. I would love to sell gaming goods, trading cards, plushies and all sorts of collectables. The obvious downside is that, living in tokyo, the competition is probably going to be insane. I am willing to relocate elsewhere if it's to open a physical store, but what are your general opinions on the matter? would an online store be better? what would be the obvious downsides of this option?

-exporting goods to europe (I'm from italy): buying goods in japan and selling them in europe sounds very profitable given the euro->yen exchange rate. there are probably a lot of foreigners who have tried something like this, so i would have to think of something that covers a specific niche or a ""revolutionary"" business plan to actually make it work, so any tips would be welcome. I also have trusted friends all over europe who would be willing to work with me on this project.

-importing goods from italy (and/or europe) to japan: doesnt sound as appealing since buying in euro and selling in yen seems less profitable, but people here go crazy for european food and goods in general, so i thought that this might be a good idea too. in this scenario it would probably be best to open a physical store though, so the costs seem much higher and it would probably be much more challenging to start it up.

-opening a simple cafe' in tokyo. That's it, as simple as that. people love cafes here, i love coffee and i like brewing my own.

With these options on the table, what do you redditors think? Which option sounds the safest when taking into consideration initial costs, general risks and competition?

I tried reading as much as I could through the sub so I could get some answers and I‚Äôve also watched some youtube videos but I‚Äôm getting mixed answers so I‚Äôm a little confused and hoping to get it cleared up. 

(I‚Äôm not a coffee fanatic and don‚Äôt have sophisticated taste buds or anything like that. I‚Äôm coming from a nespresso vertuo deluxe and I normally liked the double espressos with oatmilk and a little bit of sweetener (honey, condensed milk, brown sugar depending on my mood). I also make my cold lattes the same way but just add ice to it.)

So I‚Äôm not used to drinking the coffee size, just the double espresso size with oatmilk. 

I‚Äôve been using cafe bustelo just because I saw people talking about it on tiktok. I‚Äôve already used my moka pot twice and my coffee was fine but I just have a few questions. 

1. When do I know the coffee is done? Do I wait for the coffee to stop coming out? I haven‚Äôt seen it ‚Äúsputter‚Äù the way it does on youtube videos, it just kind of slows down a lot and doesn‚Äôt do anything else.

2. When do I close the lid? Never? Once it starts brewing? Up to me?

3. When do I take it off the heat? Once it starts brewing or can I just leave it on the heat if it‚Äôs not sputtering? 

4. I am using an electric stove with the coils. My heat is from 1-8 and I put my moka pot on the 4. It was a nice slow steady brew with no major sputtering in the end. Should I lower it to 1? Or keep it at 4? 

5. I have the 6 cup moka pot. The coffee it produces- is that supposed to be for 1 person or should I halve it for 2 people? I have been halving it trying to get a double espresso size but not sure if the size is correct for a double espresso. 

6. Any coffee recommendations? I‚Äôm trying to keep it simple for now and just buy pre ground. I have tried the cafe bustelo only and have read about lavazzo on here so will try that next.

Trying to start small with coffee grinds and eggshells, which are the two things I dispose of daily. I wanted to also make the most out of them after having my eggs and coffee grinds and I live in an apartment anyway (with a tiny habitat of plants), hence I figured this would be a good idea. 

I have had success with my first batch, where I cleaned and dried the egg shells, crashed them, and then mixed them with air-dried coffee grinds. I put the mixture in a lidded jar and shake it when I walk by. The resulting compost makes my plants pretty happy. It was a one-time experiment, after seeing positive effects on my plants, now I am thinking if there's a way to streamline the process. 

What I am thinking is a large bin where I throw in eggshells or coffee grinds whenever available, stir them, and leave them be. I am asking because I think composting is quite similar to fermentation, which is something I am more familiar with, and I am aware not all ferments like continuous new materials while they do their things. I am wondering if that might be such a case with what I want to do. 

What do you think? Would that be ok? If that's not good, what other process would you recommend?

As an aside: though my plants are happy with this fertilizer, I have way more coffee grinds and eggshells than my plants need. Are there any other ways to use the compost?",1,1729665904.0,composting,3,1.0,False

The gravel crackling on the ground below

As we set off on another grey day

For a massive storm is heading our way



We drive for a long time with no radio

Music plays as the easygoing goes

Through my headphones the ukulele blares

Which sometimes gets a hold of my hair



We stop at the Co-Op to get a cocoa

I take out my book and now I know

Where I‚Äôm up to with my story I write

Pitter patter! Raindrops are in sight



My support worker returns with the drink I need

We park to a place where I can think or feed

I discover my coffee‚Äôs a maple flavour

But still, the autumny taste I savour



There‚Äôs a mug holder in the back of the car

Which is right near me, not too far

I open it up and put my drink in

But something‚Äôs horrid about the taste within



Maple is for pancakes, not chocolate I‚Äôm told

But during this time I had to be bold

I drank every drop and tried to like it

But to my support worker I said I disliked it



We drive through the rain to Tesco in town

Where my support worker drives through the rain with a frown

He‚Äôs gonna get nappies for his daughter‚Äôs bum

All the while I‚Äôm a very reasonable chum



We get our food from Tesco, it looks yummy

Just what I need to fill up my tummy

But my support worker has to get his first

So I grab my book before things get worst



I write and I write while the rain drums beats

Waiting and waiting for something to eat

When my support worker returns, we eat right away

While in my head rice, bananas, beans and veggies play



With me now full, we drive on the bridge

To where the seals live far over the ridge

But they aren‚Äôt here, the storm‚Äôs in full circle

Is it me or am I seeing purple?



So off we drive back home, beep beep

Off on down to my main street

Home at last, oh what a day

"" How do I (‚óèF) tell my husband (‚óèM) that I don‚Äôt want to celebrate my birthday with him? "" from r/relationship_advice on reddit. ( I don't write the age for protecting your personal information. )

My husband‚Äôs birthday was just a few days ago. I wanted to take him out to dinner and he said he just wanted a lowkey birthday at home, so I respected his wishes. We have been married for 3 years and together for 7. We have two children ‚óè and ‚óè years old. In the past years I‚Äôve always tried my best to make him feel special on his birthday. Baking his favorite cake, made his favorite meals, did a surprise bday celebration one year, have decorated the house, and got him presents. His parents and siblings Don‚Äôt do anything for his birthday and always act like it‚Äôs any other day. His own dad forgot his bday this year and I had to call him to remind him.

For this birthday, I got his favorite coffee and donuts when he woke up. Had baked two apple pies per his request the night before with my sister after working a full work day and taking care of my kids (he works nights and isn‚Äôt home till 9:30-10) I Had balloons downstairs and his presents from me and the kids waiting to be ready when he walked downstairs. Everything was going well the morning of his birthday. We got home that afternoon and I stared to get a really bad headache. I‚Äôm under a lot of pressure and get headaches often. I‚Äôm the main caretaker of my children, home, and I work full time in a very difficult and demanding job. My husband tries to help, but always uses his commute and work as an excuse. Anyways, he asked me what was wrong and I told him my head was hurting badly. He was so upset and said ‚Äúwow, even on my birthday I have to deal with your bullshit‚Äù threw a tantrum, then everything went downhill from there.

My ‚óè year old wasn‚Äôt listening during lunch so my husband took him up to his room slammed the door shut, and started yelling at him and I ran up there to rescue my son and told my husband not to ever yell at him like that. I was already in semi tears bc of his response to my headache and then my husband told me in front of my 3 year old ‚ÄúI hate you, yelled and said I want a divorce‚Äù then things escalated very badly. I didn‚Äôt care it was his birthday anymore and I was so overwhelmed with sadness so I left. A few hours pass by and I tell my husband let‚Äôs just have pizza and pretend for the kids since they were so excited to sing happy birthday etc. He then proceeds to tell me this is the worst day of his life & he‚Äôs the saddest he‚Äôs ever been in his life and that I left to punish him & I didn‚Äôt make him feel special. At this point his birthday doesn‚Äôt even matter since he said all those terrible things to me.

My birthday is coming up in 2 weeks and I just don‚Äôt want to do anything with him at all. I promised myself to focus on my health for this birth year and stop putting my energy into him since he doesn‚Äôt give me the energy I feel I deserve. How can I communicate to him the reasoning behind why I don‚Äôt want to spend my birthday with him this year?

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

„Äé My husband‚Äôs birthday was just a few days ago. I wanted to take him out to dinner and he said he just wanted a lowkey birthday at home, so I respected his wishes. We have been married for 3 years and together for 7. We have two children 2 and 3 years old. In the past years I‚Äôve always tried my best to make him feel special on his birthday. Baking his favorite cake, made his favorite meals, did a surprise bday celebration one year, have decorated the house, and got him presents. His parents and siblings Don‚Äôt do anything for his birthday and always act like it‚Äôs any other day. His own dad forgot his bday this year and I had to call him to remind him. „Äè„ÄÄ

„ÄÄ

„ÄêMy view„Äë; I understand your feelings you respected his wishes.. **Have you respected your happiness as well as you‚Äôve respected his wishes ?**

Respecting his wishes **doesn‚Äôt mean** **you abandon your happiness** and **you ignore your happiness** and **you don‚Äôt give priority to your happiness for him.**

Do you understand that ? „ÄÄ

Regarding ‚Äú In the past years you‚Äôve always tried your best to make him feel special on his birthday. Baking his favorite cake, made his favorite meals, did a surprise bday celebration one year, have decorated the house, and got him presents. His parents and siblings Don‚Äôt do anything for his birthday and always act like it‚Äôs any other day. His own dad forgot his bday this year and you had to call him to remind him. ‚Äú, that means **you‚Äôve done your best for his happiness and making him feel special on his birthday as you've written that..**

**Why have you chosen doing that for making him feel special on his birthday ?**

Because **what makes him feel special** means **his emotions and you can‚Äôt control his emotions,** you try to control his emotions.

**Have you followed his wishes on his birthday only but also followed what he wants to do ?**

Because **you have your relationship you don‚Äôt tell him what you don‚Äôt want to do with him.**

Regarding **you‚Äôve done your best for his happiness and making him feel special on his birthday,** that means **you don‚Äôt give you the energy you feel you deserve.**

I feel **you would have given priority to him within your inside.**

To give priority to follow what he wants to do **doesn‚Äôt bring more happiness** to the relationship between **you and him,** because **you abandon what makes you happy** and **you ignore your happiness** and **you don‚Äôt give you the energy you deserve to take happiness while you give priority to his happiness,** so **he doesn‚Äôt know what to do for making you happy** and **he doesn‚Äôt know what makes you happy** so **he can't give you what makes you happy..**

„Äé For this birthday, I got his favorite coffee and donuts when he woke up. Had baked two apple pies per his request the night before with my sister after working a full work day and taking care of my kids (he works nights and isn‚Äôt home till 9:30-10) I Had balloons downstairs and his presents from me and the kids waiting to be ready when he walked downstairs.

He was so upset and said ‚Äúwow, even on my birthday I have to deal with your bullshit‚Äù threw a tantrum, then everything went downhill from there. „Äè

„ÄêMy view„Äë; Regrading you stared to get a really bad headache and you‚Äôre under a lot of pressure and get headaches often, as you‚Äôve written you‚Äôre the main caretaker of your children, home, and you work full time in a very difficult and demanding job, **does that mean a lot of pressure for you ?** or **do you feel like you have to do for making him feel special on his birthday within a lot of pressure ?**

Even you feel like he uses his commute and work as an excuse, **do you give priority to ask him for help ? Have you given priority to what makes you happy for you ?**

Regarding you told him your head was hurting badly and he was so upset and said ‚Äú wow, even on his birthday he has to deal with your bullshit ‚Äú threw a tantrum, I feel **you are not treated preciously by him.** I mean, that means **you would have not cherished yourself** and **you would have given priority to cherish him** and **you would have not told him how you treat yourself.**

When he said that, **you would have been able to be upset, Were you upset ?**

His actions mean **you‚Äôve given priority to him, you‚Äôve done your best for his happiness.**

„Äé My ‚óè year old wasn‚Äôt listening during lunch so my husband took him up to his room slammed the door shut, and started yelling at him and I ran up there to rescue my son and told my husband not to ever yell at him like that.

At this point his birthday doesn‚Äôt even matter since he said all those terrible things to me. „Äè

„ÄêMy view„Äë; Regarding he told you that you left to punish him, **did you really leave to punish him ?** **If you don‚Äôt leave to punish him,** ‚Äú **did you tell him that you didn‚Äôt leave to punish him ? Did you tell him that you were so overwhelmed with sadness regarding his actions so you left ?** ‚Äú

**He would have felt** like you left to punish him, **he would have felt his actions he was so upset** regarding your headache and his birthday and he started yelling at your son **as a sin,** so he would have told you that..

Regarding he told you that you didn‚Äôt make him feel special, I have two perspectives. **Through receiving his words, one perspective** means **you get his mommy.**

**You** **mirror what he has believed about the relationship between him and his mother.**

**He mirrors** what **you‚Äôve believed about the relationship between you and your mother or your father.**

**Sometimes a man can‚Äôt express his feelings by his words so a man says what is against his feelings. Another perspectives** mean **he didn‚Äôt make you feel special, he felt what didn‚Äôt make you feel special and happy and he was so upset** like **a sin.**

He didn‚Äôt make you feel special, **that mirrors what you didn‚Äôt make you feel happy and special,** **you didn‚Äôt give you the energy you feel you deserve.**

**He mirrors what you already give to yourself, how you treat yourself.**

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

„Äé My birthday is coming up in 2 weeks and I just don‚Äôt want to do anything with him at all. I promised myself to focus on my health for this birth year and stop putting my energy into him since he doesn‚Äôt give me the energy I feel I deserve. How can I communicate to him the reasoning behind why I don‚Äôt want to spend my birthday with him this year? „Äè

„ÄêMy view„Äë; I think **it‚Äôs amazing that you promised yourself to focus on your health for this birth year and stop putting your energy into him** since he doesn‚Äôt give you the energy you feel you deserve.

Regarding **you feel like he doesn‚Äôt give you the energy you feel you deserve,** that means **you don‚Äôt give you the energy you feel you deserve,** **mirrors what you‚Äôve done your best for him and making him feel special.**

Because **you don‚Äôt feel what you don‚Äôt give to yourself.**

So I asked you the first, ‚Äú **Have you done your best for you and your happiness ?** ‚Äú

In more deep words, **Have you made him help you for living your life happily ?**

Probably **you would have helped him for making him happy,** you would **have** **given him the energy you feel you deserve.**

It‚Äôs **so important to tell him** your feelings **you just don‚Äôt want to do anything with him at all**, **you promised yourself to focus on your health for this birth year and stop putting your energy into him since you feel like he doesn‚Äôt give you the energy you feel you deserve** for you, **to tell him why you don‚Äôt want to spend your birthday with him this year.**

**Do you have your relationship you can‚Äôt tell him even you don‚Äôt want to do with him ?**

**You can‚Äôt tell him what you don‚Äôt want to do with him,** that means **you would have adjusted to him so much, you would have given priority to him within your inside.**

Do you **fear to tell him your feelings you don‚Äôt want to do with him ?**

If you fear that, ‚Äú **What do you fear ?** ‚Äú

In my counselling,

* **You will get what you give to yourself for telling him your feelings you don‚Äôt want to do with him.**
* **You will get what you give to yourself and him for building trust relationship between you and him.**
