I woke up early in the morning and got up right away. I was excited. Really, really excited. Tomorrow is my birthday. Tomorrow I will be eighteen and I will meet my wolf. I couldn’t wait to shift for the first time. They say it is painful, but I didn’t care about that part. It is just for a little while, and it gets easier later. I can survive a little bit of pain.

I just wished that my parents were here to see me shift for the first time. It had been eight years since they died, and it hadn’t gotten any easier.

They were killed in a rogue attack.

Rogues are wolves that don’t belong to a pack. They become rogues by being exiled from their packs for committing various crimes. Some of them choose to leave their packs and live like rogues. That is rare, though. We wolves are pack animals. We don’t like being alone. When a wolf chooses to become a rogue, it is mostly because something bad has happened to them in their pack or they have lost their mate, gone crazy and left the pack.

The rogues live alone. They don’t work with other wolves. But when they attacked our pack, they were working together. It was very odd. Since that night, our Alpha learned that there is a rogue wolf who has gathered other rogues to attack various packs. They call him the Rogue King. The attacks haven’t stopped since. They attacked our and other packs multiple times.

On the night of the attack, rogues tried to kill our Alpha’s son. We were celebrating his 18th birthday and his first shift. He was supposed to start his training to become a new Alpha and take over the pack.

However, that night, rogues killed his father, our former Alpha Luke. He was forced to become an Alpha right away. And he did an amazing job. He finished his training early and he made our pack one of the strongest ones.

My father was Alpha Luke’s Beta. He and my mom died protecting Alpha, Luna, and their son. That was their job.

After their deaths, my brother Andrew became Beta. He and our Alpha were best friends since childhood, and now they run our pack together.

My brother is an amazing Beta, and an even better brother. He was 17 when our parents died, and after that, he had to take care of our pack and me. He never complained. He took those responsibilities and did the best he could. And he did great. He always made sure I was safe and taken care of. He still does.

I finished high school a few months ago, and all I have to do now is train. After the attacks, my brother and our Alpha decided that all pack members must train to be able to defend ourselves.

The rule in our pack is that we all must go through high school. It is something similar to a human high school, but we learn werewolf and pack history, pack laws, and everything needed to help the pack function properly. For example, if a wolf is interested in working for Alpha, he or she will learn a bit more about running the pack. If a wolf is interested in agriculture, he or she will learn about plants and our crops to help sustain our food supplies. If a wolf is interested in defending the pack, he or she will learn about defense techniques, attack formations, and they will have to spend more time training than the rest of us. I chose to help the Alpha run our pack. It was natural to me. My brother is the Beta and I wanted to help him as much as I could. So, I learned all about pack laws and everything else needed to successfully run our pack.

The Alpha, Beta and pack healer are the only ones who leave the pack to go train for their positions. They go to different packs where they learn everything needed for their positions in a pack. The training lasts for about a year.

Considering our pack was attacked and our former Alpha was killed, our new Alpha and Beta finished their training in only a couple of months. The pack needed them, and it had to be done quicker than usual. I missed my brother when he left, but I knew it was something he had to do.

We have to train every day, but tomorrow I get a day off because it is my birthday and my first shift. It is a special occasion. The first shift is important because you get to meet your wolf, and your mate.

Mates are important in wolf culture. A mate is your special someone, picked by our Moon Goddess. It is the connection of two souls. Your mate becomes the most important thing to you. You love them instantly. You want and need to be with them and protect them.

My brother still hasn’t found his mate. And neither did our Alpha. So, until he does, his mother, Gloria, still has the Luna title and does the Luna duties.

She had a hard time after her mate, our former Alpha, passed away. She almost didn’t make it. She didn’t eat, sleep or do anything. That is what happens when you lose your mate. Your will to live goes away. However, she recovered, and she is an amazing Luna. I love her a lot. She helped me and my brother after our parents died, and she and I have a special relationship. She is like a mother to me.

I asked her to be present for my first shift. She accepted and gave me a big hug. It is a big deal to be present for a wolf’s first shift. At least in our pack. Each pack has its own tradition, but in ours, only the wolves you choose get to witness your first shift. And it was an honor to be chosen.

I chose my brother, Luna Gloria, and my friends Amy and Jacob. They were all honored and excited for me.

I couldn’t wait to shift. It will be amazing. And maybe I will be luckier than my brother and meet my mate soon.

I had to go to training soon, so I brushed my teeth, took a quick shower and got dressed. I put on my black tights, training bra, grey hoodie and my black Nike sneakers. I tied my long brown hair into a ponytail and went downstairs.

# Chapter 2

I was unpleasantly surprised when I came downstairs. Sienna was standing in my kitchen looking at me like she wanted to kill me.

She is my brother’s and Alpha’s best friend. She is 25, just like my brother and Alpha, and she has been hanging out with them since childhood. Now, she is clinging on to them like they are a lifeboat. She was devastated when she found out that neither my brother nor Alpha were her mates. That didn’t stop her from trying to become Luna. She is always around Alpha, proving herself and trying to convince him to take her as his chosen mate.

Werewolves can do that. If their mate dies or they don’t find their true mate, they can take a chosen one. It is frowned upon, especially in our pack, because we take mates very seriously. Most packs do, actually. But some have a milder attitude toward chosen mates.

Sienna was tall, blonde, and perfect. Her make up was always on point. Her hair was always combed and styled to perfection. But she destroyed all that with the way she behaved. She was bitchy, mean, and disrespectful. She hated me and treated me like I was trash. But only when we were alone. When we were around my brother or Alpha, she was a totally different person. She was nice to me, and she once told my brother that I was like a little sister to her. Yuck. I tried telling my brother about her, but he didn’t believe me. He told me I was jealous of her and how much time they spent together.

“Sienna.” I said coldly and grabbed a mug from a cupboard.

“Good morning, ugly.” she said and smirked. “It must be good to sleep as long as you do.”

“Maybe you should try it to.” I said as I poured coffee into my mug. “You need as much beauty sleep as you can get.”

I turned towards her with a smirk on my face. She was pissed.

“You little bitch.” she said through her teeth. “I will become Luna soon and I will exile you so soon you will not be able to blink.”

She always did this. She threatened to exile me when she would become a Luna. I knew she would actually do it, and I could only hope she didn’t become a Luna.

I wanted to say something back, but I heard the front door open. My brother and our Alpha walked into our kitchen. Sienna quickly put on the biggest fake smile on her face.

I rolled my eyes. How didn’t anybody see how fake she was?

“Good morning, little one.” my brother said and kissed my forehead.

That was his favorite nickname for me. I was small, smaller than any wolf my age, and he liked to point that out. Especially because he was huge. 6’4, and had muscles all over his body, just like Alpha.

We looked a lot alike. We both had brown hair and bright blue eyes. He was more tanned than me, though. I inherited my mom’s pale complexion. I wa out in the sun all the time, but I couldn’t seem to get tanned.

“Good morning, Andrew. Good morning, Logan.” I said and smiled.

I get to call Alpha by his first name only in the privacy of our homes. On other occasions, I must refer to him as Alpha. Or Alpha Logan.

Sienna didn’t like that. She gave me an ‘I will kill you’ look over their shoulders.

“Good morning, Emma.” Logan said as he sat at our kitchen table.

“What are your plans today, Em?” Andrew asked as he poured coffee for himself and Logan.

“Nothing much.” I responded. “I have a training session in an hour and then I will just hang out with Amy and Jacob.”

“Tomorrow is your first shift. Are you excited?” Logan asked me and took his coffee mug from my brother.

“Yes.” I said and smiled brightly. “I can’t wait to meet my wolf.”

“Maybe you will find your mate, Emma.” Sienna said coldly. “And maybe we will lose you to him tomorrow.”

She gave a fake sad look to my brother. Goddess, they were so blind if they didn’t see through her act.

“Don’t worry, Sienna.” my brother said. “She will always be our little sister. No mate will take that away from us.”

I wanted to scream and throw up. She was not my sister! She was a fake bitch who couldn’t wait to get rid of me! But I couldn’t say anything, so I just gave him a fake smile.

“After your shift, you can start working at a pack house.” Logan said. “You went to high school to work at the pack office, right?”

“I did.” I said and smiled. “I can’t wait to start working.”

“Good.” Logan said and smiled.

He was handsome, even more when he smiled. And that was rare. He was usually very serious and focused only on his job as an Alpha. He always did what’s best for his pack. That was why he was so successful.

He was as tall and as muscular as my brother. Maybe even more. The alpha and beta of the pack were always the strongest wolves. And it always showed. You could always see who alpha and beta were. He had dark blonde hair and green eyes. His jaw and his nose were chiseled perfectly, and his lips looked soft. He was hot. No wonder Sienna was all over him.

She drooled after my brother as well but being Beta’s mate wasn’t good enough for her. Although, if my brother took her as his chosen mate, she would accept that as well. She was only after the title and power. Too bad they couldn’t see that.

We met a few times at the library and got along really well, and I’ve been thinking about asking her out — partly because I like her, but also because I want to stop overthinking and know where I stand.

I have a few questions though, especially since this would be our first actual hangout outside the library:
	1.	How do I even ask her out without sounding too intense?
Like can I just say “I want to take you on a date”? Or is that too much? What’s a smooth way to ask that feels casual but still shows I’m being real?
	2.	Where should I take her?
I don’t want to do something boring like just “grab a coffee” — I want something that’s fun but not awkward or too try-hard either. Any creative, low-pressure ideas?
	3.	Would a girl go out with a guy who can’t pick her up?
I don’t have my license yet, so I can’t drive. Would that be a red flag? If not, how should I plan things around that — like, should I meet her there or is it okay to ask her to come to a location on her own?
	4.	What do girls expect on a first date nowadays?
Like emotionally — are they expecting something chill, something flirty, something deep?

Any advice would really help. I genuinely like her but I don’t want to come off as awkward or overdo things.

Thanks!

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

On some days, I think of you and smile. I remember the times we walked under a single umbrella in the rain, trying to hold each other up as we slipped and slid our way back to Millenia; the dates we spent in Megamall as we walked the entire length of the mall, eager that we could finally hold hands away from school; the drinks we downed as we relaxed on the couch and watched Brooklyn Nine Nine during breaks. On some days, I think of you and can’t help wishing I could have those moments with you all over again.

On some days, I think of you and hate myself. I remember the times I was short-tempered, lashing out whenever something was bothering me and you would try to calm me down; the messages I never replied to, the calls I forgot to make, the letters I never wrote; the effort I could have put into making you feel special with a single gesture. On some days, I think of you and can’t help wishing I could go back in time just to do things better.

On some days, I think of you and cry. I remember that you have someone else, that you’re happy, that you’re content. I recall the peaceful smile you had on your face when we talked in Dunkin Donuts, and I swear I had never seen you smile like that with me. It hurts, knowing that I really just couldn’t make you smile like that, ever, no matter how hard I tried. On some days, I think of you and can’t help wondering if I could have ever made you truly happy.

On some days, I think of you and wish that I had never met you. So that I could just avoid all this — this pain, this anger, this feeling of just never being good enough for anyone to just stay. I am so sick of being the one who gets left behind, the one that just the eventual stepping stone, the one that gets experimented with and abandoned only when they realize that it’s never really going to work out. On some days, I think of you and can’t help wishing that we had never happened.

But.

On some days, I think of you and sigh. I hope he makes you happy. I hope he treats you well. I hope that when you walk together on the street, he walks on the side closer to the cars. I hope that when you cross the pedestrian lane, he holds your hand to make sure you don’t fall behind and freeze in front of the cars. I hope he holds doors open for you. I hope he surprises you with your favorite snacks and coffee. I hope he makes you feel wanted. I hope he’s everything that I couldn’t provide. On some days, I think of you and take a moment to exhale, as if letting go of this breath could hasten the process of letting you go.

On some days, I think of you and admire the entire spectrum of emotions you induce in me, despite the current monochrome state of my present days.",1,1747224744.0,WLW_PH,1,1.0,False

I’d love to get your perspective, especially since this is a first date with someone I genuinely feel a good vibe with, and I really want to approach it the right way.

So here’s the situation: I (male, early 30s) matched with someone on a dating app. She’s not super active with texting, but she did say she really enjoyed our conversations and wants to continue them in person — which honestly made me even more excited to meet her.

Now, I live in Long Island and she’s in the city. I was thinking of offering to pick her up, but then I paused — is that too forward or potentially uncomfortable for a first meet? Would it feel better if I simply gave her the option and let her choose what feels safest and most convenient?

As for the actual date — I originally thought a cozy coffee spot could be a chill way to continue our convo, but then I started second-guessing myself. Some people say coffee dates can feel a little stiff or even make people anxious (caffeine doesn’t help nerves, right?), whereas drinks might help set a more relaxed tone.

Here’s where I’d love your input:

	•	As a woman, how would you feel if a guy you hadn’t met in person yet offered to pick you up vs. just meeting at the place?

	•	Would a coffee shop make you feel comfortable and at ease, or would a casual bar or lounge feel more natural and low-pressure for getting to know someone?

	•	Are there any little things a guy can do on a first date that make you feel considered and respected?

I really want her to feel comfortable and also show that I’m genuinely interested — not trying too hard, but definitely trying enough.

**Classification**: Supernatural Powers, Light-Based Abilities, Ocular Powers

**Type**: Thought-Based

**Energy Consumption**: None

**Threat Level**: 1

**Summary**:

What happens when your perverted medium of, not so much, confidence asks you to help him with some valuable tests that his temple organizes and on top of that he offers you a massive amount of coffee jellies? Saiki has the answer.

One day Toritsuka suddenly asked Saiki to help him with a test of courage that his temple was organizing, he refused at first but when Toritsuka mentioned that a member of the temple was an expert chef who would cook everything they asked for if they helped, he couldn't refuse.

All Saiki did was make his eyes glow a little and play a few sounds to make it all fit together.

This isn't the first time this power has appeared, when he was a child a drawer got stuck and as his mother wouldn't allow him to break the drawer to open it. He had to develop bioluminescent eyes that allowed him to illuminate without a flashlight to see what was stuck.

# Trivia

* Toritsuka was the one who originally proposed the test of courage, after a madman started spreading fear of ghosts. He may be a pervert, but he doesn't tolerate injustice towards ghosts.
* Saiki also accepted because, Toritsuka wanted to show the people at the temple that he could be responsible and not just a pervert. No bad intentions, not trying to harass women, just helping ghosts and people.
* Naturally, as his X-Ray vision and night vision developed, this power became redundant, so now he only uses it to occasionally look intimidating.
* As Kusuo developed this power, he learned how to change the brightness, width of the beam, and colour.

I couldn't find any direct experience with this model beyond some promotional material on youtube and the Vacuum Wars [Roborock 2025 Buying Guide](https://vacuumwars.com/ultimate-roborock-breakdown-2025-buyer-guide/) that described its features.

I live alone, I have hard floors, no pets, wear no shoes inside and I was mainly looking for a vacuum-only model without a gigantic ugly dock, so that I could house the robot below my coffee table. Moreover I find the idea of having to replace bags very abhorrent: I can empty the canister myself well enough, thank you very much.

Initially I ordered a Eufy C10 for 270 euros... oh boy that was the wrong choice (maybe I'll talk about it on r/eufy): I returned it after a day. Eufy's navigation was slow and awful. I then briefly considered the very cheap Dreame D10 Plus Gen 2, whose base wouldn't wouldn't have fitted under my coffee table. What really pushed me to the Q10 S5 was Roborock's famous superior navigation and the fact it has proper obstacle avoidance. The optional vibrarise 2.0 mopping system with onboard water, and 2 extra mopping pads for 300 euros in total sweetened the deal.

And yeah this thing is a beast at navigating. I wish it had the extending brush like the Eufy C10 but it seems to be cleaning well even without it (and I'm sure Roborock is eager to create a new annoyingly named SKU featuring it). The app is much better than Eufy's, although Eufy's can make you edit how you want each room to be cleaned (this after always hearing Vacuum Wars saying how ""granular"" Roborock's app was).

⸻

Coming to the fragrances:

BLU OUD BY AHMED AL MAGHRIBI – My favorite out of this lot and probably the only package I’ll not throw away.
Great atomizer plus the beautiful leaf design on the back.

Notes:
	•	Top: Bergamot, cypress, and leather – can’t really smell the leather
	•	Heart: Incense, violet leaves, and geranium – again not a harsh incense, and the geranium adds a good sweetness
	•	Base: Patchouli, musk, agarwood, and guaiac wood – well-balanced, not cheap-smelling oud note

Scent Profile: If you wanna smell like a sheikh, this is a good scent. A great balance of sweetness and woody notes from the oud. Very unique – the oud doesn’t overpower nor is it headache-inducing. Smells like an expensive attar overall – a really nice blue smoky fragrance.

Performance: Haven’t macerated it but straight up without maceration – 6 sprays I used before keeping it on the shelf: 3 on skin, 3 on clothes.
	•	Sillage: Pretty good – 2 hours easy, even went on a ride. Moderate sillage after an hour – you might go nose-blind, but the scent is there.
	•	Projection: Good
	•	Longevity: 6+ hours on skin, probably longer on clothes

9/10 – Great fragrance

⸻

The Kingdom by Lattafa – I just love JPG DNA. Comes in a good box.
Okay atomizer – has projectile dysfunction in the start. I don’t like the gold on the bottle.

Scent Profile: May feel a little harsh for the first couple of minutes but settles down into a really nice balance between dark and sweet, with whiffs of cool mint keeping it interesting in the blend. A fresher take on Le Male Elixir. In the dry down, it becomes sweet and powdery – a similar dry down to 9PM but with a dry tobacco making it different, more sexy. Wore it to work yesterday. Overall, I feel it’s a great date night fragrance – one of Lattafa’s best.

Notes:
	•	Top: Lavender, mint, and sage – mint is subtle like spearmint
	•	Middle: Vanilla, tobacco, and orange blossom – not sickly sweet vanilla, a nice tobacco note in dry down, subtle orange blossom
	•	Base: Tonka, benzoin, and labdanum – the benzoin is what makes it not sickly sweet IMO

Performance: Again, same – haven’t macerated it, used the same way I used Blu Oud
	•	Sillage: Okay – I didn’t have time to note but at least 45 minutes
	•	Projection: 2 feet – not beast mode
	•	Longevity: On my skin, I applied it at 4:30 PM, felt it till 12:30 – so solid 8 hours

8/10 – but I feel it’ll be a solid 9/10 after maceration. The 8 is for the scent profile

⸻

9PM Rebel by AFNAN – Basic box, good colorway. Inside the packaging you don’t have to have a tacky bottle – I wish Kingdom came in a simple glass bottle instead.
Good atomizer – you have to really click the cap in place.

Notes:
	•	Top: Mandarin, pineapple, and Granny Smith apple
	•	Heart: Oakmoss, cedarwood, and vanilla
	•	Base: Ambergris, dry wood, caramel, and musk

Scent Profile: Haven’t given it a wear test – will give it next week. Applied it on a tester same day while testing Blu Oud.
Straight out the bottle – I love fruity fragrances, and it starts with a pineapple blast. Had to smell a couple of times to get the hint of green apple with a nice support of freshness. Haven’t smelled Qaeed Al Fursan, but the pineapple is different compared to Honor and Glory. Slight similarity to CDNIM.
Dry down gives, at least to my liking – musky, slightly green, sweet caramel + vanilla – again not overly sweet, and pineapple settles with woody note. Great quality-smelling fragrance.

Performance: Wear test is due, but initial spray filled the whole room.
Sprayed 6 times before keeping it to macerate – went out, came back after 6 hours, could still smell it in the washroom (yeah that’s where I spray – don’t want to be choked).
On tester, smelled it after 8 hours – disappeared the next day.

8/10 – Scent profile is to my liking

⸻

Asad by Lattafa – Threw away the box. Hate the bottle design, hate the cap. Okay atomizer.

Notes (as per Lattafa):
	•	Top: Black pepper, pineapple, tobacco
	•	Heart: Coffee, iris, patchouli – you can feel the iris
	•	Base: Amber, vanilla, dry woods, benzoin, labdanum – good amber feel

Scent Profile: Twist on Dior Sauvage Elixir profile. I feel you shouldn’t ask much from a fragrance in this price range. Similarities in the opening with Sauvage Elixir. A really nice dry woody aromatic, slightly fruity – not a headache-inducing tobacco note, which is very subtle. Nice ambery feel to it.
Note breakdown makes you think it may be complicated but it’s not. It’s straight – in simple words: spicy with vanilla. It’s masculine.

Performance: After 1 week of maceration – wore it to work, 5 sprays
	•	Sillage: Good – I could get whiffs all the time
	•	Projection: Fills the room initially – 2–3 feet for 3 hours
	•	Longevity: Sprayed it at 4 PM – smelled it easily till 11 PM

7.5/10 – A good clone, maybe 8–8.5 after it completely matures

⸻

Ramz Silver by Lattafa – Got it for ₹1000. Tacky bottle – words on it don’t make any sense. Threw the box.

Notes:
	•	Top: Pear, lavender, bergamot, and mint
	•	Heart: Cardamom and sage
	•	Base: Vanilla, amber, musk, and patchouli

Scent Profile: I love Ultra Male DNA – loved 9PM. Not the quality of 9PM, I guess.
Really close to 9PM, has a slight difference in the starting note – the pear and mint are there, but you can feel the alcohol in the start and in the dry down.
Basic generic vanilla with earthiness – maybe because of the patchouli. Definitely a cold weather casual fragrance – very playful.

Performance: After 1 week of maceration
	•	Sillage: Okay
	•	Projection: Okay
	•	Longevity: I smelled it on me for 6 hours

7/10 – Could be 8 if the quality was better, but overall bang for the buck

⸻

Khadlaj Island – Threw the box. Lovely bottle, awesome atomizer.

Notes (as per box):
	•	Top: Pineapple, iris, ginger, and cypress
	•	Heart: Coconut and woodsy notes
	•	Base: Tonka, sandalwood, amber, and ambergris

Scent Profile: Boarded the hype train and bought it. A really close clone of Le Beau Le Parfum. Have to let the alcohol calm down in the start. Then pineapple, minty settles down into an almost powdery tonka bean and iris.
Now the note which many hate – the coconut. If you just focus on it, you’ll lose the overall vibe of the perfume. Yeah, it gives a Parachute coconut oil vibe – probably because IT HAS A REALISTIC COCONUT, which is rubbery – kinda like dry coconut.
Wow – coconut note smells like coconut. But no one is gonna sniff you like Jeremy Fragrance and say you smell like Parachute oil/coconut. That one note doesn’t spoil the overall bubble of this fragrance. A good summer vibe fragrance – nice sandalwood amber feel.

Performance: Got it today – 6 sprays in the air, 5 hours – I can still smell it
Will give it a wear test.

6.5/10 – Okay. Feel they could’ve made it much brighter in the dry down. Will see after maceration

⸻

The 30 ml Decants:

CDN Untold by ARMAF – Got it from Wiffculture. Cute bottle.

Notes:
	•	Top: Saffron and jasmine
	•	Heart: Amberwood and ambergris
	•	Base: Fir resin and cedar

Scent Profile: Was thinking to get the bottle. I smelled BR 540 once – liked it, and they say it’s one of the best clones of it. I directly did wear it, and that was a mistake – kept 5 sprays out of habit. I went on a ride and it was choking…
Never had a saffron scent before – for 9 hours this scent didn’t settle down into something else. You get what you get from the start. I got a couple of compliments though – maybe because they could not ignore the fragrance.
Spray with moderation – 2 sprays max, 3 if you’re feeling bold. Good quality amberwood – musky. If you spray too much, it’s sickly sweet.
I don’t give “beast mode” tag easily – but this is it. Good for occasions where you don’t want to go unnoticed.

2 sprays – meethi kheer. 2 se zyada – bawasir
6.2/10 – Could have been 7.5 if I didn’t decide to give myself a migraine

⸻

Cocoa Morado by French Avenue / Fragrance World

Notes (as per French Avenue):
	•	Top: Saffron, cinnamon, cardamom, ginger, nutmeg
	•	Heart: Dates, oud, caramel, amberwood, incense
	•	Base: Madagascar vanilla, tonka bean, cocoa butter, musk, leather, benzoin, labdanum

Haven’t smelled the real thing but wow this smells expensive. Opening isn’t very good – the saffron isn’t for me.
The dry down – the oud in this isn’t cheap or headache-inducing. It comes out sweet mixed with other notes.
Love the leather in it – it’s a mix of different notes – very exotic, very addictive. I kept on smelling my wrist. Limited wearability – maybe these two bottles will last me a year.
Statement-setting kind of fragrance.

Performance: Really, really good
9 hours minimum
9/10 – Loved it. Will think of getting the bottle once this is done

⸻

Terre D’Hermès EDT – 2ml

Notes:
	•	Top: Orange and grapefruit
	•	Middle: Pepper, pelargonium, and flint – not sure I can pick the latter two
	•	Base: Vetiver, cedar, patchouli, and benzoin

Gift from Wiffculture.
1ml is roughly 16–18 sprays. 30–36 sprays if people want to try designer/niche – 2ml samples are not a bad deal.
I hadn’t smelled it in 10 years. Everyone knows about it.
Not my cup of tea, but I’ll wear it occasionally. Bright from the start, woody when it calms down. Good performance for an EDT. Very masculine – old school – a timeless scent.

1kmde3f,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1kmde3f/intimacy_has_left_my_marriage/,Intimacy has left my marriage.,"Married two years ago. Me (50M) Wife is 49 (F). For the last year intimacy has been almost non existent. Sex only happens when I initiate it. It feels like a chore in her part. It was not that way the first year. Wife complains about everything. The house, my children, money and often continues to compare me to an ex husband and boyfriend. Husband left her after 15 years and was unfaithful. She shows little attention and priority towards the relationship. Mostly spends all of her time cleaning obsessively and working as many jobs as possible. She has her own business and takes on more and more jobs  daily. Unless she plans an activity, she shows no desire to do anything I like. For example, I planned an anniversary getaway. The day we were supposed to go, it rained horribly and we didn’t go because most of what I planned was an outside activity. So, we rescheduled for the following week. The following week came and the day before our trip  I was advised she could not make it, as she picked up a small contract for the rescheduled day and could not make it. Bottom line we didn’t go. Her routine at home is to talk on the phone with her friends for hours each day and then watch TikTok for hours before going to bed. When she talks with me it is to assign me with whatever task she wants me to do. I work outside the home and have a professional job. When I show interest in do things that  I like she never participates. I do them on my own. She never has time. Even for simple things like sharing a coffee in the morning. She leaves for work hours before her start time and has breakfast with her friends whenever possible. We rarely share meals. When she is talking with her friends it’s  always about men. She sends them current pictures off of social media of her exs. Allegedly so they can see how he is looking worse. She Finds pictures off of social media also of men her single friends may like. When we talk she picks on any negative traits I have and just beats them into the ground. She is a very attractive woman and seems to seek attention. I am often accused by her of hiding things. Which I am not. She inspects my phone looks in my work backpack and monitors who I talk to. I feel I am being gaslighted. I have waited for her to show interest in rescheduling our anniversary trip. Instead she is focusing on going on a vacation with her single friend so they can go dancing. If I were to do the same, she would flip out. She tells me the lack of intimacy is due to changes in her hormones. Which is definitely possible. However, she is often rude to me and generally not very caring or affectionate. I have tried to talk to her many times about this. Nothing changes. I am considering moving on. What do you all think about this? The lack of intimacy is messing with my sense of self worth. I want to be sensitive to the hormone issue, but I do not believe it. Any advice would be appreciated. ",0,1747224186.0,Marriage,2,0.5,False

***Baker Botts’ Rebecca Seidl, John Papaspanos, and Tyler Kendler say executive attention on critical minerals is driving billions of dollars into partnerships to meet demand domestically.***

Critical minerals essential for defense, digital, and clean energy technologies are in high demand, and the Trump administration is opening the door for a surge in partnerships to increase domestic production.

These minerals, such as lithium, cobalt, and copper are among the fastest growing commodities globally and represent a significant opportunity for investors and developers of projects and related infrastructure. McKinsey [estimates](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/metals-and-mining/our-insights/the-raw-materials-challenge-how-the-metals-and-mining-sector-will-be-at-the-core-of-enabling-the-energy-transition) that $250 billion-$350 billion will be needed for new copper and nickel critical minerals projects by 2030. This growth could [create](https://about.bnef.com/blog/mining-industry-needs-2-1-trillion-dollars-in-new-investment-by-2050-to-meet-net-zero-demand-for-raw-materials-finds-bloombergnef-in-new-report/) a trillion-dollar market in the wider critical minerals industry by 2050.

However, they are also subject to supply chain risks. Lithium, a vital component for advanced battery chemistry, has its production heavily concentrated in Australia, Chile, China, and Argentina. After extraction, lithium must then be refined to meet specifications for commercial use, adding another tenuous link to the supply chain.

Companies such as Tesla have [made](https://www.tesla.com/blog/tesla-lithium-refinery-groundbreaking) large investments to increase domestic processing facilities for lithium. However, foreign dominance in processing means that even with increased domestic production, many raw materials are shipped to China ahead of being used in electric vehicle batteries and other end products.

This reliance on non-US supplies and processing has led the US Department of Defense to invest in lithium as a critical mineral for national security and economic stability. With demand for lithium expected to outpace supply by 2030, increases to domestic capabilities will be needed to match.

# US Production Directives

President Donald Trump has issued several executive orders to support the increase of US production of minerals intended to address national and economic security risks posed by foreign mineral production and further narrow the gap between increasing demand and the capital required.

Starting his first day back in office, Trump started rolling out an energy agenda that centered on the importance of domestic production and refining of critical minerals.

**Unleashing American Energy.** One of Trump’s Day One executive orders [aimed](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-american-energy/) to establish the US as the leading producer and processor of rare earth minerals by removing regulatory barriers and opening more public lands for mining. Market actors are monitoring the pause of disbursements of funds under the Inflation Reduction [Act](https://www.irs.gov/inflation-reduction-act-of-2022) until a review ensures alignment with the policies of the Trump administration, which include increasing the production and processing of critical minerals in the US.

**Declaring a National Energy Emergency.** Another Day One order identified critical minerals as a top priority and the lack of resource development as an “extraordinary threat” to the US economy and national security and directed agencies to expedite the completion of all authorized projects.

**Establishing the National Energy Dominance Council.** On Feb. 14, Trump issued an order establishing a council to advise him on how best to make America energy dominant on the world stage, including improving processes for permitting, production, and export of critical minerals.

**Immediate Measures to Increase American Mineral Production**. On March 23, Trump [issued](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/immediate-measures-to-increase-american-mineral-production/) an order to boost US minerals security by expediting permitting for “priority” mining projects on federal lands through the Defense Production [Act](https://www.fema.gov/disaster/defense-production-act) and using financing programs such as the US International Development Finance Corporation to fund domestic mining projects.

# Private Sector Partnerships

To meet rising demand and to address supply chain issues, sponsors are exploring new sources of capital and financing structures for projects along the entire supply chain, from extraction to processing and refining, which are typically capital intensive and require long lead times.

The market is seeing more strategic mergers and acquisition, including between industry participants. There has also been a growing trend of major oil and gas companies and oilfield services companies investing in direct lithium extraction—an efficient alternative means for sourcing the key critical mineral.  
  
Joint ventures are also on the rise, with partnerships forming between large mining majors and smaller mining companies, and inter-industry collaborations. For example, General Motors and Lithium Americas formed a joint venture for the Thacker Pass project, with General Motors investing $625 million in direct equity. The anticipated production is expected to support up to 800,000 EVs and reduce reliance on non-US suppliers.

On April 1, Lithium Americas and General Motors [announced](http://lithiumamericas.com/news/news-details/2025/Lithium-Americas-Announce-FID-for-Thacker-Pass-Phase-1-and-Closes-Strategic-Investment-from-Orion-Resource-Partners/default.aspx) they took a final investment decision for the development and construction of Phase 1 of the Thacker Pass project and had satisfied all remaining equity capital financing requirements under the previously announced $2.26 billion loan from the Department of Energy.

Grants, loans, and tax credits established under the Biden administration have been crucial for supporting the development of large-scale critical minerals projects and related infrastructure that can underpin a domestic circular economy for critical minerals, spanning the value chain from mining, processing, and refining of raw materials, to the recycling of end products.

The Department of Energy Loan Programs Office, through programs such as the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing initiative, opened new avenues for sponsors seeking project debt financing to construct these projects that would otherwise face challenges in obtaining debt from private sector financing sources.

We expect that recent executive measures intended to increase US mineral production through unlocking “regulatory bottlenecks” and establishing recommended strategies for expediting domestic mineral production will result in a significant increase in public and private partnerships, additional sources of capital, and new financing structures to meet the significant demand from industries that rely on critical minerals to remain competitive.

* Achieves 99.5% Purity Scandium Oxide  
* 99.2% Purity Rare Earths Oxide 
* Overall Sc recovery from ore to final product to a very good 77.3% 
* **Increases annual output to 91 tpy scandium oxide** 

 

MONTRÉAL, QUÉBEC – TheNewswire - May 13, 2025 – Scandium Canada Ltd. (the “Company” or ""Scandium Canada"") (TSX VENTURE: SCD) is pleased to confirm that it has completed a campaign for the optimization of its mineral processing and hydrometallurgical flowsheet for scandium and rare earths recovery from the Crater Lake project at SGS Canada Inc. in Lakefield, Ontario. The results of these tests will be used to prepare a Pre-Feasibility Study (PFS) for the Crater Lake Project located in northeastern Québec.

 

The current process leads to a 99.5% purity for the scandium oxide precipitate, which is the primary commercial product from the Crater Lake Project, and to a 99.2% purity for the rare earth oxides, which are the secondary output from the Crater Lake Project. This is the first instance of achieving reportable purity levels of the oxides from the Company’s flowsheet. The purity of scandium oxide is well within acceptable limits for its use in Aluminum-Scandium alloys, which Scandium Canada targets as the main end-use of scandium oxide.

 

Dr. Peter Kondos, Ph.D., FAusIMM, Scandium Canada’s Technical Advisor mentioned; “The hydrometallurgical optimization has performed exceptionally well, with a high scandium recovery of 93.3%, bringing ***the overall Scandium recovery from ore to final product to 77.3%, which is a remarkable performance in this field.”***

# MAY 12th 2025~ China’s rare earth curbs have ‘changed psychology’ at US firms

China’s weaponization of rare earths in its trade war with the US will spark a much greater focus on American supply security for critical minerals, according to MP Materials Corp., the only US miner of the key materials used in smartphones and defense applications.

“Regardless of how trade negotiations evolve from here, the system as it existed is broken, and the rare-earth Humpty Dumpty, so to speak, is not getting put back together,” the miner’s chief executive officer, Jim Litinsky, said on an earnings call last Friday.

China, which dominates global supply, [put export restrictions](https://www.mining.com/web/seven-rare-earth-metals-that-china-is-weaponizing-against-the-us/) on seven types of rare earths last month, widely viewed as a response to President Donald Trump’s trade assault. Companies including Ford Motor Co. have warned of shortages, and US negotiators had hoped to address rare earths in their Geneva appointment with Chinese officials, according to people familiar with the matter.

The teams emerged from two days of talks touting “substantial progress” toward resolving trade differences, leaving markets waiting for more details due to be outlined later on Monday.

Litinsky used the company’s earnings call — before the meetings in Switzerland — to argue that China’s measures were a decisive break with the past by exposing the vulnerability of key industries. MP Materials began mining rare earths in California in 2017, started refining in 2023, and plans to sell rare-earth magnets to General Motors Co. by the end of 2025.

“This idea that there was a threat that has now been utilized has really changed psychology, I think, from everybody across the board,” Litinsky said. “My impression from conversations with the Department of Defense is that there is a full-on recognition that we can’t be reliant on Chinese magnetics for national security purposes.”

China’s previous use of rare earths as a trade weapon — against Tokyo more than a decade ago — mobilized Japanese industry to significantly reduce its reliance on Chinese supplies. The US and other western nations had already begun moves to mitigate China’s grip on critical minerals, but the curbs on rare earths and other niche commodities has prompted greater urgency.

“For years, we have warned that the global rare-earths supply chain was built on a single point of failure,” Litinsky said. “With China’s sweeping tariffs and export restrictions, that geopolitical fault line has now become a commercial reality.”

# MAY 12th 2025~ Restoring American mineral dominance with a US critical minerals action plan

[US critical minerals action plan | Deloitte Insights](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/public-sector/critical-minerals-strategy.html)

https://preview.redd.it/gswz5kmwiq0f1.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=8eb0a78da624711455f55fbb54e9901c58382dde

Over the past three decades, critical minerals have transitioned from being little-known outliers in the more remote corners of the periodic table to becoming a key part of the modern economy. Gallium, for example, is used for semiconductors in LEDs, transistors, and solar panels. Germanium is used in fiber optics, infrared detectors, and lenses. Antimony is a vital flame retardant in textiles and plastics, and is also used in lead-acid batteries and munitions. Unfortunately, however, of the 50 elements deemed “critical” to the American economy and national security by the US Geological Survey,[^(1)](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/public-sector/critical-minerals-strategy.html#endnote-1) the United States is 100% dependent on foreign suppliers for 12 of them, and is over 50% reliant on non-domestic sources for another 29.[^(2)](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/public-sector/critical-minerals-strategy.html#endnote-2) If key US industries[—]()from advanced manufacturing to energy, semiconductors, and defense applications—continue to rely on foreign mineral supply chains, the United States will be left ever more vulnerable to potential disruptions of those same supply chains and industries.

This vulnerability was recently exposed. The People’s Republic of China, which became the global leader in mineral extraction and refining in the late 1990s, started to restrict exports of gallium, germanium, and antimony in 2023. In December 2024, it banned their export to the United States, Japan, and the Netherlands altogether.[^(3)](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/public-sector/critical-minerals-strategy.html#endnote-3) Then again, in early 2025, China expanded its critical mineral export controls to include tungsten, indium, bismuth, tellurium, and molybdenum,[^(4)](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/public-sector/critical-minerals-strategy.html#endnote-4) meaning over one-fifth of the critical minerals for which the United States is more than 50% import-reliant are currently subject to Chinese export restrictions.

It was not always this way. From the 1950s to the 1980s, the United States led the production and refining of rare earth elements (REEs), a subset of critical minerals consisting of 17 different elements that are significant inputs for heat-resistant alloys and magnets used in some of the most advanced US military equipment.[^(5)](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/public-sector/critical-minerals-strategy.html#endnote-5) However, the globalization of mineral supply chains, high domestic production costs, environmental challenges, and a reprioritization in government research and development investment and infrastructure contributed to a domestic decline in both extraction and processing.

Improving critical minerals security has been a bipartisan point of focus across all recent administrations, going back to the Obama administration, including executive orders, legislation, and policy interventions such as the World Trade Organization’s trade actions. Over time, these interventions have progressively become more granular and targeted. Nevertheless, progress in the past decade toward achieving resource security has been slow.[^(6)](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/public-sector/critical-minerals-strategy.html#endnote-6) More than 15 federal agencies are currently engaged in activities and programs aimed at increasing the United States’ mineral security,[^(7)](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/public-sector/critical-minerals-strategy.html#endnote-7) but these initiatives have at times overlapped or lacked effective coordination. As the US government considers anew how to strengthen America’s economic and national security, many industry stakeholders are calling for a more cohesive and coordinated approach to critical minerals development to accelerate results.

The Trump administration has made critical minerals security a key component of its energy-focused strategy, evident by no fewer than five recent executive orders (EOs) seeking to address the American deficiency in the mining industry.[^(8)](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/public-sector/critical-minerals-strategy.html#endnote-8) These executive orders lay the groundwork for a comprehensive approach to increasing US mineral production, including accelerating and streamlining permitting, reconsidering certain regulations, mobilizing additional financing, and opening up federal lands and military bases for mining and processing. To assist in ongoing efforts to develop a national critical minerals strategy, we’ve defined an approach to pairing such a strategy with a targeted action plan. Based on Deloitte’s experience advising most federal agencies focused on this issue, we’ve identified and prioritized time-sequenced actions to advance the goals defined under the Jan. 25, 2025, “Unleashing American Energy” EO and in a subsequent, forthcoming national strategy.

# A framework for a US critical minerals action plan

Through EO 14213 (Establishing the National Energy Dominance Council, February 20, 2025), the president created and empowered the National Energy Dominance Council (NEDC) comprising at least 19 senior US government officials to advise the White House on strengthening the US energy sector, improving permitting and regulation, enhancing private sector investments, and facilitating cooperation among government agencies and industry, including for critical minerals.

To ensure that critical minerals are sufficiently prioritized, the NEDC could clearly delineate roles and responsibilities for NEDC members to lead and coordinate US government critical minerals efforts and restore America’s dominance in critical minerals, spearheaded by the recently nominated “critical minerals czar.” An initial goal of the NEDC could be to develop a time-sequenced, execution-oriented critical minerals action plan with clearly defined objectives and targets. Consistent with EO 14213, the NEDC could coordinate, manage, and work closely with relevant US government agencies and key private sector stakeholders to implement the critical minerals action plan and help identify additional policy and investment measures that could increase the supply of key minerals and enhance supply chain security. The critical minerals action plan could focus on three priorities.

* **Fostering a domestic renaissance** for the mining and processing of critical minerals
* **Strengthening international cooperation** and expanding US access to critical mineral production and processing capacity of America’s global partners
* **Mitigating risk** and fostering a well-functioning and more transparent critical minerals market

The priorities of this critical minerals action plan could inform a set of 13 time-sequenced actions[ ]()that could help advance the achievement of three key outcomes.

* **Reduced reliance on imports from selected countries,** measured by official trade data
* **Enhanced competitiveness of the reconstructed US mining industry,** measured by regular, reputable surveys such as the survey conducted by the Fraser Institute[^(9)](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/public-sector/critical-minerals-strategy.html#endnote-9) capturing key industry data, including average permitting time, the number of workers in the critical minerals industry, and the number of projects in development
* **Reduced risk of market disruptions,** measured by numerous formal reporting channels, including stockpile reporting, price volatility, and increased transparency

An overview of the key actions that could drive toward the US government’s desired outcomes is summarized in figure 1.

# Priority 1: Foster a domestic renaissance for mining and processing critical minerals

Advanced development of the critical minerals industry in the United States, including mining, processing, and downstream manufacturing, has been hindered by numerous factors: complex and unpredictable regulatory and permitting processes; weak project economics stemming from anti-competitive market manipulations by foreign actors with resulting price instabilities; a shortage of trained mining and mineral processing professionals; and the lack of risk-tolerant, patient capital to support extended exploration and project development timelines. Reviving the domestic critical minerals industry requires a targeted and time-sequenced approach addressing constraints to project development and accelerating private sector investment in the domestic market.

EO 14241 (Immediate Measures to Increase American Mineral Production, March 20, 2025) sets out several actions to accelerate the permitting and financing of domestic production and processing, including identifying priority mineral production projects for which expedited procedures could be applied; clarifying the treatment of waste rock, tailings, and mine waste disposal; and identifying and implementing measures to prioritize mineral production on federal lands. Priority actions defined below would support the effective use of these measures and related EOs.

**Action 1(a): Accelerate federal loan, equity, and grant financing to expand primary domestic critical mineral production (medium complexity, high impact, one to two years to implement).** Expanding domestic critical minerals production and processing will require significant public and private investment in capital and innovation. Given the relatively high risk and upfront costs of mining investments, expanded use of public finance can play an increasingly catalytic role in mobilizing private investment. This can be achieved by mitigating risk, lowering the cost of capital, and defraying startup and transaction costs.

The US government can leverage and expand existing financing platforms to rapidly deploy funding to expand primary domestic mineral production. This includes the Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office and the Department of Defense’s Defense Production Act (DPA) funding. EO 14241 delegates authority to the secretary of defense and the chief executive officer of the US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) to utilize DPA funding to this end via the DFC.

To supplement such plans, the US government could also expand funding authority within certain programs (such as the Industrial Base Analysis and Sustainment Program) and modify exposure limits to enable agencies to cofinance future domestic financing requirements with US financial institutions. In support of these efforts, consideration should be given to increasing available funds, streamlining processes, and reassessing as well as clarifying sourcing restrictions and exceptions.[^(10)](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/public-sector/critical-minerals-strategy.html#endnote-10)

**Action 1(b): Accelerate the secondary processing of critical minerals (byproducts) that are associated with existing domestic primary production (medium complexity, high impact, two to four years to implement).** Several critical minerals can be obtained as byproducts of domestic primary production, including selenium in copper production, gallium from aluminum refining, germanium from zinc smelting, and bismuth in copper and lead smelting. However, the upfront capital costs and limited market sizes for the byproducts often prevent the secondary processing of these minerals.

The US government could accelerate the development of secondary processing capacity for critical mineral byproducts by identifying priority-associated minerals and providing catalytic grants, concessionary project loans, and guaranteed offtake agreements to existing primary producers or interested third parties. Such efforts could include the coordinated development of centralized or regional processing hubs where co-located primary production could promote efficiencies.

**Action 1(c): Reduce costs and lead time for developing domestic mining and processing capacity by streamlining permitting and regulations, and ensuring that proper environmental safeguards are in place (high complexity, high impact, two to four years to implement)**. According to S&P Global, it takes nearly 29 years to build a greenfield mine in the United States, the second-longest timeline in the world.  As a result, only three new mines have commenced operations in the United States since 2002, and only 10 are currently in development.

In the United States, numerous federal, state, and local authorities are involved in permitting and regulatory review, often with their own applications, data requirements, and processes. To address this, the US government agencies responsible for permitting and regulatory reviews at the federal level (for example, the Department of Interior’s Bureau of Land Management, the US Forest Service, the US Army Corps of Engineers, and the Environmental Protection Agency) could work with state and local authorities to align on a common standard for data collection and information-sharing. This could enable project developers to provide all necessary data and information in one place and format where all regulatory agencies could access the data they require.

Deloitte [implemented a similar approach at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission](https://deloitte.wsj.com/riskandcompliance/sec-updates-xbrl-rules-fordigital-financial-reporting-01594839728), which shifted to the use of eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) and refined required data fields so that industry and other data users could automate the submission, extraction, and analysis of electronic quarterly reports. At the state level, the federal government could leverage, or replicate, the [Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission (IOGCC)](https://oklahoma.gov/iogcc.html) to convene and streamline state-level regulations and policies for minerals development on state and private land. The IOGCC played a key role, working with the federal government, in addressing government and public concerns associated with hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling to realize the shale oil and gas revolution, which made the United States the world’s largest producer of oil and gas. Identifying opportunities to reduce or remove overlapping responsibilities and requirements, and using time-bound, predictable approval processes and sustainability measures could significantly accelerate permitting and regulatory reviews, as well as oversight.

**Action 1(d): Expand primary domestic exploration on federal lands through co-funding, the augmentation of precompetitive geoscience data, and the use of existing artificial intelligence and machine learning tools (high complexity, high impact, two to four years to implement).** Exploration is a critical first step in increasing domestic critical mineral production, but many junior exploration companies lack access to adequate financing to enable broad, industry-led, early-stage exploration. The Department of Defense’s [Manufacturing Capability Expansion and Investment Prioritization](https://www.businessdefense.gov/ibr/mceip/index.html) office, which has provided financial support to domestic exploration projects like nickel exploration in Minnesota and cobalt exploration in Idaho, provides an example of how to incentivize and mitigate risks for domestic critical minerals exploration. The US government could also invest in improving the quality, availability, and standardization of precompetitive geoscience data to be used by industry to more efficiently and effectively identify exploration targets, similar to what has been done as part of [Canada’s Critical Minerals Geoscience and Data initiative](https://www.canada.ca/en/campaign/critical-minerals-in-canada/federal-support-for-critical-mineral-projects-and-value-chains/critical-minerals-geoscience-and-data-initiative.html).

As [Deloitte’s 2025 Tracking the Trends report on mining and metals](https://www2.deloitte.com/global/en/Industries/mining-metals/research/tracking-the-trends.html) notes, precompetitive geoscience data includes all geological, geophysical, geochemical, and other types of data created and curated through federal, state, and territory government geological surveys and made available to the public. When analyzed by skilled geoscientists with the assistance of rapidly improving artificial intelligence and machine learning models, this data can significantly improve the identification of potential critical mineral resource deposits and stimulate exploration activity across geographies and essential mineral commodities.

**Action 1(e): Build the mining workforce of the future by creating tailored workforce development and training programs, and leveraging artificial intelligence tools (medium complexity, high impact, more than four years to implement).** With a rapidly retiring US mining workforce and ongoing AI work transformation, both public and private sectors can take immediate action to develop the US mining workforce of the future. The federal government can work with national laboratories and leading geology and engineering academic institutions to help expand relevant curricula and support apprenticeship programs. Such efforts could focus both on traditional, four-year academic programs and certifications in targeted areas (such as welding and mine safety).

Workforce development and training programs can be designed to reflect the way mining and processing work will be done in the decades ahead, relying on the significant use of machine learning, agentic AI, and more across operations, including for predictive and prescriptive maintenance, data entry and analysis, standards reporting, process design and optimization, and capital project design. Reskilling, upskilling, and training current and incoming workers on AI tools and best practices will enable organizations to maximize workforce productivity. For more details, see trend 7 in [Deloitte’s 2025 Tracking the Trends report on mining and metals](https://www2.deloitte.com/global/en/Industries/mining-metals/research/tracking-the-trends.html).

**Action 1(f): Increase investment in R&D to improve mining and processing efficiency, productivity, and innovation through new technology and artificial intelligence (medium complexity, high impact, more than four years to implement).** Expanding R&D funding in critical mineral mining and processing through the DPA or via the Department of Energy labs or other channels could drive efficiency, productivity, and innovation in the sector. R&D focused on reducing the usage and protection of water resources during processing and waste management, especially tailings storage facilities, can help improve the sustainability of mining projects and mitigate local community concerns regarding potential negative project impacts. This could include reducing the cost of dry-stacking tailings and improving water recycling capabilities. Increased R&D investment will also help draw new talent into the industry by encouraging higher education institutions to put more resources behind their mining and minerals programs, expand program and course offerings, and attract more young professionals into the sector.

1kmdbbv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kmdbbv,PC build with Intel ES CPU + mining Nvidia CMP 40HX GPU (~200$),"As a fun project i've decided to build a PC using ""Mutant"" Intel CPU named QTJ2 (basically a mobile chip, which was mounted to a lga1151 socket) and one of the nvidia's mining GPUs called CMP 40HX, which performs on the same level as rtx 2070 when overclocked using msi afterburner.  
Full specs:  
Mobo: Asrock B365m Pro4 - 30$  
CPU: Intel QTJ2 (same perfomance and specs as 10400) - 30$  
GPU: Asus CMP 40HX (there are no other manufacturers) - 70$  
2x8 gb DDR4, overclocked to 3067 MHz (this is the max available speed for QTJ2) and 512 gb m.2 SSD(dont mind the 2nd one, i got it for free anyway) - 50$  
Some random cheap 400W PSU - 15$  
What should you keep in mind when you build something like this:  
1. QTJ2 is a great chip, but it is not overclockable. it'll probably be better if you will buy QQLT(8700k) or even QQLS (9900k). I bought it just because it was cheaper + i'm not really experienced with overclocking anyway. Also, when you buy those ES chips you should check if the PCIe is capable to work with all 16 lanes(some are limited to 4x or 8x, which really limits the performance of the GPU)  
2. You will need a bios programmer, like CH341a which i used. Almost all the chips require BIOS modifications, and to do it you will need a program called CoffeeTime. There is a youtube channel called Miycost, you can find a video here which showcases QTJ2 and in the description there will be the instruction with required software. Since bios modification requires to disable ME, Intel PTT will stop working. That means you will not able to use TPM at all, and install the official copy of Windows 11. The only fix to this problem is the purchase of a separate TPM module(costs 5$ on Taobao). Check if your mobo will support it beforehand. You can buy basically any motherboard, because wih ES chips you will be able to overclock both cpu and ram even on H-series chipsets.   
3. Since this is a mobile CPU, it limits itself to 45W under a heavy load. You will need to set both ""Short/Long Duration Power Limit"" to the max value available. Then it'll work fine.  
4. If you will be using a mining gpu, you will need to check if the seller already did x16 mod, because most of them are working with only 4 PCIe lanes. The mod procedure requires to solder the missing capacitors. Dont forget that mining GPUs usually(if there are any at all) dont have any video output available, so you will need to use a 2nd GPU or iGPU to output the video to your monitor. Then you will need to enable ""Above 4G decoding"" in your bios and install NvidiaPatcher drivers from github(follow the instructions there). Also you could add ReBar support by modding your bios again, maybe it'll improve perfomance, i forgot to do it unfortunately. 

CPU take 65W, GPU 185W. A good 400-450W power supply shoud be enough for this build. If you will have any questions, i will be happy to answer to them. Is it worth building this for 200$? Idk, but since i live in a 3rd world country, it's actually a pretty good value for this price.",2,1747223963.0,PcBuild,1,1.0,False

Here’s what to know before you buy,"Mushroom coffee has gained a lot of attention in recent years, often promoted as a brain-boosting, mood-balancing, and gut-friendly upgrade to your morning brew. But how much of this is genuine, and how much is just clever marketing?

**The truth is:** not all mushroom coffee is created equal.

# 🧐 Is there even mushroom in your mushroom coffee?

Yes, functional mushrooms like Lion’s Mane, Chaga, Reishi, Cordyceps or Shiitake do show promising health benefits in scientific studies. However, a large portion of mushroom coffee products contain **only small traces** of the actual active compounds needed for any real effect.

Some brands rely on **low-grade extracts**, or use so little mushroom that you’re unlikely to notice any benefits at all. Worse, many blends include **fillers, sweeteners, and processed oils** that work against the product’s supposed health angle.

# ✅ What to look for in a legit mushroom coffee?

High-quality mushroom coffee brands are transparent about what they use. They’ll typically highlight one (or both) of the following:

* **Measured amounts of active compounds** such as [beta-glucans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-glucan) (the beneficial polysaccharides), cordycepin, ganoderic acids, or erinacines. Look for at least **200 - 400 mg of beta-glucans per serving**.
* **Full-spectrum, 100% fruiting body extracts**, not just mycelium or myceliated grain. A good dose is **200 to 400 mg per serving**, with **300 mg** being a solid standard for daily use for high quality extracts.

If a product doesn’t clearly state what part of the mushroom it uses or how much extract is included, it’s best to be skeptical.

# 🛒 Should you buy pre-made mushroom coffee or DIY?

Some pre-made mushroom coffees are genuinely good but they tend to be expensive, and many use instant coffee with minimal mushroom content.

Another option is to **buy high-quality mushroom extracts separately** and mix them into their own coffee at home. This gives you full control over:

* **Mushroom type and dosage**
* **Coffee quality (e.g. freshly ground vs. instant)**
* **Additives and sweeteners (or none at all)**

# 📌 Quick checklist when buying mushroom coffee

* 100% fruiting body (not just mycelium)
* Extracted (ideally dual-extracted)
* Minimum 200 - 300 mg mushroom extract per serving
* Beta-glucan content clearly stated
* No unnecessary additives or sweeteners
* Transparent labeling

**Bottom line**: don’t let slick packaging fool you. Always check the label, verify the extract type and dosage.",1,1747223788.0,MushroomCoffee,1,1.0,False

El Camino Crystal Locomotive THC28 $99 for 15g - I got this as a replacement for my Mango Lemonade script (Its just too high in terpenolene for me). This strain is higher in Limonene and linallol which I like! These nugs looked like snow covered Christmas trees which was super appealing! Very Diesel / Earthy flavours and i found it much more enjoyable and not as racy as a usual sativa! It helped me zoom in on work with the creativity i needed for the job! Defintely didnt need another coffee after smokin this in the morning! Im an indica guy and would just keep this for pre lunchtime consuming. For day time energy, this would definitely be the strain to keep on repeat! I felt like i could run a marathon even though I cant run 50 metres!

Everytime I ask the pilots to turn the water on at the gate, it seems like it’s the biggest inconvenience and some outright refuse. So have just always wondered what the reasoning is.

i get why people place emphasis on maintaining friendships while in a relationship because romantic breakups happen and everyone should have a support system, but the idea that someone should always put their friends before their partner is so off putting. 

(this is more for heterosexual relationships because most straight men aren’t good people) 

is your guy friend going to give you a family and hold you down like that in the future? is your mate going to be birthing your child? will you be waking up next to your guy best friend in the morning and make breakfast for each other with coffee and forehead kisses? why are you already viewing your ROMANTIC and INTIMATE relationships as a temporary arrangement, projecting a lack of commitment, and devaluing the time and effort both parties are and should be investing?

While many travelers flock to the coastal resorts for sun and surf, the heart of Phuket offers an experience that's just as unforgettable—only in a very different way. If you're looking to dive into the soul of this tropical paradise, a stroll through Old Town should be at the top of your list.

One of the most captivating things about Phuket Old Town is its architecture. Walking down Thalang Road, you'll find yourself surrounded by beautifully preserved Sino-Portuguese buildings that date back to the 19th century. These pastel-hued shophouses, with their ornate windows and wooden doors, offer a visual feast for anyone with an eye for design or photography. It’s like stepping into a living museum, where every building tells a story.

As you explore deeper, you’ll discover hidden alleyways leading to vibrant street art and tucked-away coffee shops. Murals painted on old walls depict local life, traditions, and even playful scenes that bring a smile to your face. Each corner feels like a new chapter in a colorful book, waiting to be discovered.

The vibe in Old Town is delightfully laid-back. You can wander through local markets bursting with tropical fruits, handmade crafts, and quirky souvenirs. It’s a great place to chat with local artisans, sample freshly made snacks, or pick up a unique keepsake that you won’t find anywhere else. Unlike the more commercialized beachside shops, the Old Town markets feel personal and rooted in tradition.

Temples and shrines dot the area, adding a spiritual dimension to your visit. The intricate details of Chinese shrines and Buddhist temples offer insight into the multicultural influences that shape Phuket's identity. Whether you're lighting a stick of incense or simply soaking in the peaceful atmosphere, these sacred spaces offer a serene break from sightseeing.

Food is another highlight of Phuket Old Town. The streets are lined with eateries offering a delicious blend of flavors—spicy curries, fresh seafood, and sweet treats that delight every palate. Many of the recipes have been passed down through generations, giving you a taste of authentic Thai cuisine that’s rich in heritage and flavor.

Evenings in Old Town are something special. As the sun sets, the streets come alive with lights, music, and laughter. Whether it's a local night market or a cultural performance in the square, there’s always something happening to make your visit memorable.

Phuket Old Town isn’t just a destination; it’s an experience. It's where the past and present dance together in a vibrant celebration of culture, art, and community. So, if you’re visiting Phuket, carve out a day—or two—to explore this charming gem.

A colleague pulled me aside, voice low, ""Don't do anything stupid. You can always land another project.""  
  
But what he didn't know? I wasn't being stupid, I was done.  
  
Just yesterday, I overheard Gwendolyn's new assistant, Rowan, practically begging her in the hall.  
  
""Gwendolyn, I want to make something of myself. Give me the project you just landed. I'll impress you, I swear.""  
  
At the time, I didn't think much of it.  
  
Gwendolyn and I had been secret lovers for seven years. I'd sacrificed my career, turned down offers from big companies, and helped her build this business from the ground up.  
  
I'd secured 90% of the company's projects. Gwendolyn knew better than anyone how hard I'd worked. She was a woman of principle, she would never screw with something as important as a project.  
  
Hell, she once lost a project to an opportunist and hated that kind of person.  
  
So when I saw the ring Gwendolyn sent me today, I thought she'd finally figured out I was the one, and she was ready to make it official.  
  
I never saw Rowan's betrayal coming, accusing me of stealing the project, publicly humiliating me like that.  
  
And what shocked me even more was Gwendolyn's complete lack of loyalty. She abandoned everything she stood for, for him, a guy who'd been with the company all of five minutes.  
  
If that's how she was going to play it, then I had zero reasons to stay at this dead-end company.  
  
Gwendolyn still didn't realize I saw through their little act. She thought I was just jealous.  
  
She narrowed her eyes at me. ""What's with the sarcasm?""  
  
Since Rowan showed up, she'd started looking at me like I was the problem.  
  
But I wasn't about to argue. I just said, ""You're overthinking it. I really am giving it to him.""  
  
I was giving him both my girlfriend and my job.  
  
I stood up to leave, but Gwendolyn grabbed my arm and yanked me into her office, her face as cold as ice.  
  
The office was small, and the walls were paper thin.  
  
As soon as she shut the door, the employees outside, who'd been watching the whole thing like it was a soap opera, immediately started fawning over Rowan, asking when he and Gwendolyn were going to get married, have kids, the whole nine yards.  
  
Rowan, acting the part like a pro, shyly said, ""Having kids is tough on women. I can't decide that for her.""  
  
It was obvious, he was already acting like Gwendolyn's official boyfriend. And since Gwendolyn stayed quiet, everyone bought it.  
  
I watched as Gwendolyn froze, realizing she owed me an explanation. Her usual tough exterior softened just a little.  
  
""Rowan's just a kid. He was joking, don't take it seriously,"" she said, trying to smooth things over.  
  
Then she added, ""He has relatives at Thunder Tech. That's how we landed the project.""  
  
I stared at her, speechless.  
  
This was beyond ridiculous.  
  
Thunder Tech had a world-class in-house tech team, they didn't need to outsource. They'd turned us down flat.  
  
It was me who didn't give up. I kept pushing until I finally got a meeting with the decision-maker. He gave me thirty seconds, and I nailed it. He tried to offer me a huge salary to poach me, but when that didn't work, he agreed to collaborate.  
  
I'd worked my ass off for this project, sacrificing sleep, running all over town, and she didn't see any of it. But she believed Rowan's half-assed story without batting an eye.  
  
If she'd just thought for a second, she'd realize that if Rowan really had those connections, he wouldn't be working as an assistant at a tiny, struggling company.  
  
Or maybe she understood everything and was just pretending to be clueless.  
  
When I didn't say anything, Gwendolyn dropped her gaze, then softening her voice, she made me a cup of coffee.  
  
She leaned in, close enough that I could feel her breath on my ear. ""I'm just pretending with him. You're the only one I'll marry.""  
  
In the past, whenever we fought, I'd cave the moment she softened her tone, promising me anything.  
  
But this time? It wasn't working.  
  
I pushed back from the desk, stood up, and said, ""You don't need to bother. I'm out.""  
  
Without missing a beat, I grabbed the resignation form, filled it out, and walked out the door.",1,1747223371.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

Okay so this is a long one. Apologies in advance. 

I (34F) have been with my fiance (33M) for 6 years (7 in a couple of weeks).
We met at university and due to some issues with family ended up living together after only a few months. It was all too soon and we fought quite a bit.
We can both be quite stubborn and our fights often got a bit out of hand (not so much anymore). 
For example, once we were out with friends and he thought I was being too friendly with someone (I was not) and he just walked off and I had to run after him and we were shouting in the street. 
Another time we fought I don't even know what about and he packed my bag and told me to leave (after throwing my phone and breaking it). Still we worked it out. 
More recently (2 ish years ago) he got very angry and threw the coffee table.
He has never raised a hand to me, though he has grabbed my arms a few times quite hard but I don't think he's ever meant to hurt me.

I fell pregnant 5 years ago and we were very happy and excited to start our family. It was quite tough as we both lost our jobs due to covid. He managed to get some freelance work and I found a job worked through my pregnancy doing some freelance work in the property sector and stopped just before baby came.

We didn't have any help when baby was born, which was fine and we managed quite well I think as he was helping with nappy changes and general stuff around the house. I was exclusively breastfeeding so he couldn't help with feeding baby, though I tried to pump and bottle feed when little girl was around 2 months but no luck. Fiance tried a couple of times and gave up saying it's not working and she doesn't like the bottle. This would have allowed me to have a little break.

I was responsible for everything then. I did the feeding, bathing, changing, bedtime and waking through the night,, laundry, cleaning, cooking, everything. It left me drained.

I also struggled with ppd which took a while to diagnose and still on medication to this day.

We had quite a big fight when baby was a few months where he broke a glass lamp and I ended up throwing my phone, which he then picked up and threw to the point of it breaking.

He said some really nasty things during the fight and called me horrible names like bittch and psychopath. When he does this I just shut down and cry and keep asking him to stop because it just hurts so much. It made me start self harming again, something I've struggled with most of my life. 

He apologised and we worked through it all and were happy together but nothing really changed in terms of chores and looking after baby. 

We then moved to a different city, away from anyone we knew, and it was happy families for a while. One day our daughter fell and hit herself on the coffee table which is when he got angry and picked it up and threw it. He blamed me for her falling and hitting herself on it and instead of comforting out LG in that moment he got angry and shouted at me. 

This was a pretty big fight following a lot of smaller arguments and I ended up taking my LG to my parents and we stayed there for a couple of days.

I dont like this side of him, he has quite a short temper and it makes it difficult to have serious discussions without it blowing up.

Anyway, we worked through it and were once again happy and then I got pregnant with a LB. We were excited and I even found a job that allowed me to work from home. So we were both working from home while I took care of our LG and was pregnant. LG didn't sleep through the night and it has always been me that has to go to her, because fiance says he needs to concentrate at work so he needs sleep, or that she doesn't want him and only wants me. I think these are all excuses, if he was persistent and more comforting then she would want him no problems. 

Once LB was born, fiance tried to help out a bit more by doing bedtime with LG and general things around the house but this was short lived and eventually we fell back into the old roles. I still did everything for LB as he was exclusively breastfed. To this day he does not cut their nails because he says he's too scared to hurt them. 

We have been getting on with life and just going through the motions, at least that's how I'm feeling. 

We moved house again and are now in a lovely village and in a beautiful house. We are struggling financially as we both have a bit of debt but working on it. 

LG goes to preschool from 9-3. LB is only 18 months so is home full time. We both work full time from home though fiance is supposed to be going into the office twice a week (which often he doesn't) and when he does i have to drop him to the station and pick him up. This means waking up much earlier and dragging the kids along as well as picking him up in the evening again with kids around 7pm.

I start work at 8 but I'm normally up around 7 due to kids and I take care of everything. I do the packed lunch, make breakfast, tidy up, get the kids dresses, while also trying to work. I also have to work while watching our LB and when I ask for help he often says he needs to concentrate or that he can't work like this we are too distracting etc. Fiance often wakes up at 8.45 and gets dressed and ready to do school run. He used to do it but now I've asked to do the school run but he insists on coming along. It's quite nice doing the walk together and I enjoy it a lot. 

He does help out around the house dont get me wrong, he takes care of the garden, he takes the bins out, he does general tidy up of toys or dishes etc. But I feel like I'm still doing the majority like the laundry, cleaning, doing the cooking and lunchboxes, bathing and dressing kids, feeding kids, and putting them to sleep. When I try to say this he gets defensive and it always goes the same way, he first says yes he does clean up after me all the time like taking my tea cups away or whatever, and then says oh he's not doing enough even though he does this and that and how I'm asking for more constantly. 

I know we have probably forgotten how to be in a relationship together since having kids and just neglected our relationship while we focus on the family and work. But it feels like we are just very different now and we've grown in different directions.

I wish he would do more without me asking. I wish he wouldn't get annoyed with me when I do a quick 5 minute vacuum daily to keep ok top of everything. I wish he was more attentive and take initiative. I am so tired constantly and mentally and physically drained. 

I feel like I'm growing to resent him for a lot of things and I'm questioning our life together. I dont know if I love him still, I know I care about him a lot but not sure if that's enough. We have two amazing kids and I dont want to mess up their childhood and life by breaking up the family. At the same time I'm not happy and I dont feel like my needs are being met. 

He's a good father and plays with the kids and they love him so much. But sometimes I feel he prioritises other things above the kids, like watching sports games he follows. 

I dont know what to do, I dont know if I'm being unreasonable with wanting more from a partner. I want to put the kids first which I think means just putting up with it and accepting this is how it is. But I'm struggling to the point where I don't want to get physical with him and I dont know what excuse I'm supposed to use.

Please help me make sense of my feelings.

Little back story I've always been a PC gamer all my life!
I'm 36 years old now but when I was around 12-13years old I bought my first gaming rig by my self with nothing but help google and online friend I had at the time...

Anyway fast forward a couple
 years ago my pc broke and I just didn't have money to buy or rebuild a new one...
I was littery without a computer for about 3 years maybe 4...
Now I finally have a chance to get a PC again due to savings..

I was looking at pc parts at first but since I'm struggling with anxiety I didn't want to do this..
Cause building in the past gave me anxiety too..
Started looking at gaming prebuilds but then I saw most of them use very crappy power supplies,unless you pick parts your self and have them assemble it something like cyberpower or origin pc...

I then started looking at gaming laptops because I was thinking since I don't really wanna sit behind a desk anymore maybe this is a good option?
I can play anywhere I want pick it up and go to a diff room and continue, or if I go somewhere like to my moms I can just bring it with me!

You can hook it up to big monitor and basically be like a desktop then you can also bring everywhere if need be..

I only play games like world of warcraft,diablo,last epoch,poe etc.
So I don't need a super beast..

Anyway needless to say I'm pretty happy infact I think I will stay with gaming laptops forever now...
This is the best pc I ever had and its a laptop! 
Pretty crazy how far they have gotton now and playing on a desk pick it up and continue on the couch/coffee table is so cool especially when I'm just leveling a toon haha..

Anyway laptops are awesome!

Oh laptop I got was Asus strix g16 

Anyone else love laptops? :)",1,1747223181.0,GamingLaptops,0,1.0,False

**digital sticky**

the first is that you can turn any alarm or timer into a 'digital sticky' (i.e. it will cease sounding but continue to display on the screen) by simply saying 'hey, siri'.

the cool thing is that this works even in airplane mode, i.e. when siri isn't 'available'.

i use these CONSTANTLY throughout the day. they are especially great when you don't know when you want to be reminded or don't want to have to keep snoozing over and over for the default 9 minutes.

for example, while i'm eating lunch, a 'check laundry' alarm goes off while my phone is in the cradle across the room and i don't want to just keep snoozing it but would rather just be reminded whenever i'm done eating (or my phone is in airplane mode so siri isn't available to snooze it).

so, i just say 'hey, siri' and, viola!, a digital sticky magically appears and i'll see it whenever i'm done eating.

*side note: and, of course, when siri* ***is*** *available, you can also stop, snooze, etc simply by commanding siri to do so, which comes in extra handy for me bc i deliberately keep my phone at a distance.*

*--- below is 'internal use only' reminders for myself to document later ---*

*unlocked lock screen, e.g. that i just needed to do so that i could have digital sticky for 'phone housekeeping'.*

*timer to drink coffee faster > snooze 'drink water' > 30 min > phone housekeeping (incl how 'layering' keeps digital sticky alive even while repeatedly snoozing 'drink' water) > floss now that mouth acidity reduced*",1,1747223040.0,Non_Medical_ADHD,0,1.0,False

# Wrong Place, Wrong Time

\~Joan\~

“This place is... wow,” I muttered as we entered the house, it had floor to ceiling windows, a fireplace and....well, it was perfect.

But something felt slightly off.

“So... how did you know about this place?” I asked Rhoda, who sat on the couch while I walked towards the window and stared down at the view of Spain.

“Well, this is one of Aaron's properties,” she chuckled. I nodded, then paused.

My stomach dropped. What?

“He doesn’t know we're here. I have the spare keys to the building. I mean, why ask when I can just walk in?” Rhoda said, glancing at me with a small smile on her face.

“This is Aaron's house?” I asked slowly. She turned around fully, raising a brow at me.

“Yeah, it’s his.” Her voice was quiet. ""What is it?""

I pinched the bridge of my nose, disbelief washing over me. The fuck?

“I can't believe you brought me to Aaron's house of all places,” I muttered. For God's sake, she knows what her brother was like and still she went ahead and brought me to his house?

Rhoda sat up straighter, her smile falling.

“Exactly why I said he has no idea we’re here. Jo, your feud with my brother is seriously getting ridiculous.”

“Oh, really? You think this is ridiculous?” I snapped, crossing my arms. “Have you forgotten the time we both landed in jail and he bailed you out, leaving me there to rot?”

Rhoda opened her mouth to speak, but I cut her off. “Or the time we crashed his party, and guess who got blamed for that? Me! He called me a bad influence, told me to stop dragging you into ‘bad things.’ He acts like I’m the villain in your life.” I gritted my teeth.

“Jo...” Rhoda trailed off.

“And now you bring me to his house? You really think I won’t get blamed for this too?” I asked. If I had known, I wouldn't have followed her.

Okay maybe, I still would have. I mean who would turn down a trip to Spain? But we would have booked a hotel room.

Not here. Not this.

Rhoda stood up and turned around the couch, walking towards me.

I’m wrong and I'm really sorry. I didn’t think. I just wanted us to enjoy our girls' trip, and this house is... well, it’s perfect.” She gestured around the house, but I barely glanced at it. “I should have talked to you about it. You’re right.”

I let out a sigh.

""What next?"" I asked and her shoulders sagged.

""Well, we could still stay here. He doesn’t know we're here. So...."" she wringled her fingers together.

""We could still leave if you want,"" she added.

""If he doesn't know we're here we could stay,"" I muttered. Well, he wouldn't just pop up in Spain now, would he?

Rhoda grinned, and I could see the relief on her face.

“We're not gonna stay inside all day now or are we?"" She asked, a glint in her eyes. I pursed my lips.

“Please tell me we’re going to see Barcelona,” She added as she grabbed my hand, and she nodded a little too fast.

“Of course! We would,"" I muttered as we dragged our luggage to the room were we would be staying.

Despite all that Rhoda had said, I still felt slightly uncomfortable. Knowing the house belonged to Aaron just didn't sit right with me.

And hell, I knew something was bound to go wrong. Wherever the man was concerned, something always went wrong.

After freshening up, we decided to explore the neighborhood. At least, we should familiarize ourselves with the vicinity since we'd be staying for a month.

“Tomorrow, we'll go see the Tower, yeah?,” Rhoda asked as we walked back after wandering through a few blocks.

I gave a small nod.

Rhoda sighed and tipped her head back, feeling the cool evening breeze wash over her face, she closed her eyes, a small smile playing on her face.

“It’s nice to breathe fresh air outside of New York,” she sighed. I glanced over at her and followed her lead, raising my head and staring at the dark sky.

Rhoda suddenly opened her eyes, and stared at me. I could see the mischievous glint in them.

“The first one back to the house gets a paid manicure at the fanciest salon in the city!” she said, and before I could process what she said, she darted off.

A laugh escaped me as I ran after her. But oh boy, the girl was goddamn fast.

Who knows? Maybe I would enjoy this trip after all.

We stumbled into the compound and Rhoda pushed the door open stepping in.

I followed after her but she stopped abruptly that I crashed into her back.

""What's it?"" I whispered as the color drained from her face.

She remained silent and I peeked at the inside from over her shoulder.

And there he was, in the living room, swirling a glass of something dark. Whiskey maybe.

His eyes were cold and his expression closed off as he finished the last of his drink, slamming the glass on the table.

I was surprised it didn't shatter. Rhoda shuddered lightly while a small frown crept up my face.

Aaron.

The devil had arrived.

# Caught In The Middle

\~Joan\~

Everywhere was silent. No one said a word, we just stared at each other. For a minute, or two?

But that did nothing to ease the hard expression on Aaron's face. His eyes just darted between us.

How is he here? How did he even know we were here? Rhoda had insisted he didn’t have a clue—she hadn’t even told him.

“Rhoda...” His voice was low and cold, just as it had always been. He wasn't one to talk much, but once he did, it carried a certain confidence. “Care to explain what you're doing in 'my' house, without my permission?”

Rhoda was silent. If I didn’t know her so well, I might’ve believed the man across from us wasn’t her brother. Seven years wasn’t much of a gap, but Aaron made it seem like a big deal.

He made everything seem like a big deal.

His gaze moved to me, and I mentally braced myself for what I knew was coming next.

“And you,” he muttered, his tone grew a little bit colder. I could practically sense his annoyance. “Still following my sister around, I see.”

“Okay. Before you get this all wrong, I had no idea this was your house,” I said quietly, elbowing Rhoda.

This was not the time for her to stay fucking silent.

“No idea?” He interrupted, standing up. And oh boy, the man was on the taller side.

His height could be imposing at times too.

""You want me to believe this wasn't your idea?"" He asked and I pressed my lips together.

There we go.

I drew in a deep breath, ignoring the annoyance already building inside of me.

“Like I said, I had no idea this house belonged to you until we were here,"" I muttered.

And Rhoda still remained silent.

""And whose idea was it?"" He asked, his eyes not leaving me.

""Maybe if you weren't such a controlling bastard, your sister would have told you we were going to use your house,” I bit out.

Okay. If Rhoda wasn't going to speak, I wasn’t going to keep silent and take the blame for something I knew nothing about.

Rhoda’s eyes darted from me to her brother. She dreaded him.

Aaron took a step toward me, his eyes grew darker. Rhoda raised her hand, stepping in front of me.

“Aaron, stop—please,” she said quietly. “She's right. This was my idea. Don’t take it out on her.”

She took a step closer to him while I took one step backward.

“You’ve always been trouble, Joan. From the very first moment I saw you, I knew you'd be trouble,” his voice had a chill to it.

I clenched my fists, resisting the urge to go all out on him. I was in his house after all.

“You know what?” I said after a while, taking a step forward and meeting his glare head-on.

“Fuck. You.” I raised my middle finger, thrusting it in his face before storming off toward the room where we’d kept our bags.

There was no way I was letting Aaron ruin the one vacation I’d had in a year. I was going to enjoy my trip—without his godforsaken, insufferably handsome face hovering around.

I yanked my clothes out of the closet, shoving them into my bag in quick movements.

I didn’t care that it was late; I would find a hotel and spend the night somewhere else, anywhere but here.

From the hallway, I heard Rhoda’s muffled yells—she’d finally shaken off the shock, but I didn’t care anymore.

“Aaron, don’t you dare! You can’t keep being a jackass to her every time she’s around!”

Her voice grew closer, footsteps approached as I zipped my bag shut, ready to leave.

The door swung open, and there they were—Aaron just standing there and Rhoda behind him, looking exasperated.

Their gazes flicked to my packed bag, and Rhoda’s eyes turned glassy as she took a step forward.

“Jo...” she whispered, her voice breaking.

I looked at her, ignoring Aaron completely.

“Just so you know,” I said calmly, “your brother is an asshole. And yeah, I’ll text you my address in the morning.”

I stepped forward, waiting for them to move out of my way.

Aaron’s voice stopped me.

“You’re not leaving at this time of night,” he said, not a statement, but an order.

I stared at him, hoping the daggers in my eyes could pierce him to death.

It would hurt Rhoda... But it was worth the try.

“No,” I said annoyed. “You don’t get to dictate what I do.”

His jaw tightened, and a flicker of something dark crossed his face.

“Try me, Joan. See if I won’t drag you back here myself. And trust me, it isn't something you'd enjoy,” he muttered, and somehow the threat sent warmth curling in my lower belly.

Damn him.

“You’re going to leave in the morning,” he continued. “I’m not letting you storm off in anger and end up getting murdered somewhere, not like it would affect me. And besides...” He glanced at Rhoda. “We still need to talk.”

With that, he turned and left the room. I blinked at Rhoda, stunned.

“Did he just threaten me?” I asked.

Rhoda stepped forward, throwing her arms around me.

“I’m sorry, Jo,” she whispered, her voice breaking slightly. “I never meant for this to happen. I shouldn’t have dragged you into this.”

I sighed, wrapping my arms around her.

“It’s not entirely your fault,” I murmured.

As much as I hated her brother, I couldn’t deny that he was disgustingly handsome.

“Just stay for the night,” Rhoda pleaded. “Please.”

I sighed again.

“Fine. I’ll stay,” I muttered. I wasn’t staying because of Aaron’s thinly veiled warning or the strange warmth his threat had sparked in me.

I was staying because Rhoda asked me to.

Not because of Aaron. Definitely not because of him.

# Before The Weekend

\~Aaron\~

I was an early riser... Or maybe that was the wrong word to use. I had insomnia, so sleeping was a problem.

Which explained why I was in the kitchen by 4 a.m., fully dressed in my usual outfit—a suit—brewing coffee. I walked into the sitting room, glancing at the windows. It was already dawn. The sky was glowing red, a warning of the day ahead.

Soon enough, the girls would be awake. Speaking of ""girls""... I took a sip of my coffee before walking toward the window, staring down at the quiet city, save for a few cars and early risers moving like ghosts through the streets.

I’d had a business meeting in Barcelona, which explained why I was in Spain. I was supposed to be finishing up by the weekend and returning to New York on Monday. I should’ve been thinking about work, logistics, my schedule. But I wasn’t.

No, I was thinking about what I’d come back to—my house invaded by my sister and her best friend.

Rhoda always had a streak of stubbornness in her, but it never flared into anything unmanageable. Until she met Joan. I had to give Joan credit for pulling Rhoda out of her grief after our parents died. But Joan didn’t stop there. She had a way of encouraging the wild, reckless side of my sister, feeding it like gasoline to a flame.

And the fact that Joan hated me? Well, that was just a bonus. I overheard her once telling Rhoda that I always looked like I had a stick up my ass. She’d go out of her way to ignore me or start an argument—anything to get under my skin.

And damn if it didn’t work.

I didn’t even realize how long I’d been standing there, staring out at nothing, my coffee growing cold. A movement in the house snapped me back. My body tensed, instinctively alert.

The house was big enough for all of us to avoid each other, but I could sense her. Joan. I wasn’t even looking, but I could feel her presence, the heat of her gaze boring into my back.

Closer, closer, until the room fell into that particular kind of silence that only she could create. I didn’t turn around.

She didn’t speak. She just moved past me, toward the fireplace, her movements slow and deliberate, like she had all the time in the world. I eventually turned and pinned her with a cool, assessing look.

Her ginger-red hair was piled into a messy bun on top of her head, strands escaping to frame her face. She closed her eyes, soaking in the warmth of the fire, her lashes dark against her pale skin. Those eyes, when they opened, were sharp and cunning—like a fox’s.

I moved to the island that separated the kitchen from the dining area, annoyed at myself for noticing things about her I had no business noticing. The quiet between us was thick, tense.",1,1747222952.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

**Part 1**

I guess I should say “Soon to be Ex-Wife”  and ""Ex Bestfriend.” Just typing that hurts. Everything hurts. I'm (Eric 28M) a full grown man, and I have cried more this last week than I think I have my whole life combined. I am so miserable.

My best friend (Charles 28M) and I have been friends since we were 8 years old. We were on all the same sports teams, each of our parents basically considers the other family. I was invited on every one of his family vacations and vice versa. We graduated high school together in 2014 and were roommates all through college. He was the best man in my wedding. It hurts so much.

As painful as this is, losing my wife (Moira 27F) is even worse. She was my everything. We met 7 years ago, started dating shortly after, have been married for 4.5 years now. I keep running through my mind. How did I lose her, what did I do wrong? I haven't let myself go, I plan dates and vacations, we are doing well financially, we have little fights but nothing big, and we always make up and do better going forward. I'm willing to say I'm sorry, I learn from our conversations, I listen. We have a healthy and active sex life. We split the work around the house. I just don't know how this can happen, I'm hunting for reasons and I can't find them. I'm so lost, maybe I'm blind to my own faults. I wish she would have talked to me.

It's so painful to say out loud what has transpired. I'm sitting here now trying to type it out. But it's hard with the tears rolling down my face.

Two months ago, Charles' long time girlfriend ended their relationship. He took it really hard. Moira and I have been doing our best to cheer him up. In fact, a week after their break up, Moira took him out to coffee to just let him get a woman's perspective while he vented. When she came back home, she was noticeably mad and kind of ranting about Charles's ex. She was saying things like, ""That woman never deserved him."" ""He's a catch, and she will regret it."" And so on. We were all close, Charles and Moira were good friends too. I felt the same as she did and chalked it up to just her being protective.

Over the next week she was on her phone a lot, when I asked who, she would tell me she was messaging Charles, giving him a little pick me up. I thought nothing of it really. Then over the last 7 or 8 weeks she started running more errands, going to meet friends for coffee or lunch more often. Charles was also acting a little odd. I was trying to be there for him, especially early on. I would invite him over or just text to see how he was doing. Over the weeks his messages back got shorter, with more time between. He came over less and less. I assumed he was just coping in his own way.

This last Tuesday, I was on my way home from work when Charles texted asking me to stop by. I told him I'd be right there. I was excited because I thought he was ""back"" and just wanted to hang out or work on something together.

I arrived and tried to make some references to our inside jokes. I laughed a little, but he just smirked and it looked like he had a tear form in his eye. He motioned for me to follow him into the living room. Moira, my wife, was sitting on the couch. When I entered the room she burst into tears. I immediately went to comfort her, thinking something bad had happened. Like someone had died.

Before I could get to her, Charles said, ""Eric, wait."" Moira at the same time put her hand up as if giving the signal to stop. Charles let a tear fall down his face and said, ""I am so sorry, I don't know how to say this. Moira and I have fallen in love.""

I felt the color run from me, my heart actually physically hurt. I wasn't sure if I was hearing this correctly. Moira just started repeating, ""I am so sorry."" The two of them were both just apologizing profusely. Then they started:

""We know it is wrong, we know it's not fair but we are in love, and we can't deny it.""

""We didn't mean for this to happen, but it did.""

""We still care for you.""

""We still love you, you don't deserve this.""

""We regret what has happened but we want to be together.""

Everything was ""We"". The room was spinning, I was having a full blown panic attack. It felt like dying, I started begging, begging them to tell me this was a prank, a joke. ""Please, I don't care if you're filming this, I don't care if you share it to the world, just please let this be fake, please "". I was hysterical in this moment. Moira put her arms around me and tried to comfort me and I let her. I just cried.

When I calmed down. They repeated, it was real. They loved each other, they wanted to be together.

I asked the how, the when, the why. After his break up, they just felt this spark at that coffee meeting. Before they knew it the spark was an inferno. They said they tried to fight it, talked about how unfair it was to me, how wrong. Then Sunday, when my wife told me she was meeting a friend to shop. She actually came here to his house, and they ""made love"" for the first time. At that point they said there was no going back. They had to face the reality of their love, and that meant they had to come clean to me.

I ran at that point. I got in my truck and I returned home. Moira followed behind, without Charles, about 10 minutes later. When she entered I asked, ""Why did you follow me?"" She said, ""Because I love you, and I don't want you to do anything permanent.""

I broke down again and begged her not to do this. Begged her to have me back. She cried hard and apologized so many times. I asked over and over again what I did wrong. What did I do to drive her away? She just kept saying things like:

""You've done nothing wrong, you have been an amazing husband.""

""I am at fault, I have failed you and fallen for him.""

""We are in love and I can't stop it.""

""It's not you, it was never you.""

""You deserve great love, and everything that comes with it. I'm so sorry I failed to give you that, and never will be able to.""

Once I was calm again, she packed two large suitcases with most of her stuff. She left that day. She moved in with Charles.

In the past week, I have received multiple apologies from both of them. Moira has been trying to check on me, telling me she loves and cares for me, and that she's here if I need her. I've left them mostly ignored. Moira told me she was extremely worried about me and asked for me just to confirm I was ""physically okay"". I did send back ""yes"". Then felt bad about responding. She didn't deserve to know.

Both Charles's parents and Moira's parents have called me this week. I answered both calls. The calls were very similar. The gist was they love me, care for me, and are so sorry. They are angry, disappointed, and hurt by their ""child's"" actions. They won't cut them off or anything, because they love their ""child"" but they can't look at them right now.

My family has been supportive, but they live pretty far away. My mother dropped everything and came to be with me for 3 days, but had to go back for work. My little brother has been checking in but he has the emotional depth of a tin can. I still appreciate his efforts.

I don't know how I'm going to survive this. It has changed my entire outlook on life. How could this happen? We had a great marriage, I know everyone thinks they do, but we really did. I tried, I really tried. Moira has said so many times that I did nothing wrong, that I was everything and more. But this still happened. If you can do everything right and this still happens, then it is inevitable. I'm so hurt. If the two most important people in your life can betray you, how can anyone trust anyone?

**Part 2**

It's been 2 months since my last post. Thank you to all those who offered support and kind words. I am still reeling. My (Eric 28M) family is trying their best to support me. Moira (27F) still messages some to ""check on me."" She was doing this almost daily and offering apologies and ""support."" After 2 more weeks of that, I finally replied, ""Please stop, you're hurting me far more than you're helping."" Now she only ""checks"" once a week.

Monday, just as work was ending, this somewhat official looking person came in and presented me with divorce papers. I went home and just sat there staring at it for the longest time before opening the envelope. I finally did. I guess you could say she's being ""generous"". I get the house, no split, no buyout. I don't want it. We bought it just 16 months ago. I remember that day, the process. We were so excited, so happy. Three bedrooms because when I turned 30 we were going to start having a family. At least 2 kids. The work we did to this place. These walls are the colors she picked out. The ""His and Hers"" sinks in the bathroom we installed together. I can't keep living here. Too many memories. All the cookouts and game nights with Charles. In my lower moments, I just want to burn it down with me in it.

The rest of the stuff in the papers is straight forward, she took all of our small amount of credit card debt, she left me $11k of the savings, taking only $3500. I guess she's trying to literally ""pay"" for my pain.

Amongst the papers was a note written by her. Another apology and request to talk. Also a warning that her and her brother (Kevin) would be by Tuesday to collect the rest of her things.

When I got home after work, they were all there waiting for me. There were two trucks. Moira and Kevin were waiting on the front porch. I could see Charles (28M) was parked across the street and sitting in his truck.

I walked up and Moira looked like she was going to cry again (I'm sure I look terrible), she tried to hug me but I put my hand up. I pointed towards Charles and said, ""What is he doing?"" Moira said, ""He doesn't feel right coming in, and says he has no right to be in your home. We needed him to drive one of the trucks."" I shook my head and let them in.

Kevin did pull me aside at one point and apologize. Told me he always considered me a brother, that this is a ""bad deal."" He didn't really want to help, but it's his sister, they've always been close. I know he is here because they don't want me making a scene. When they loaded the rest of her personal things, and the few pieces of furniture that were hers from before our marriage. Kevin said, ""I'll be right outside.""

I had spent most of their ""visit"" sitting on the backyard slab. Thinking about how Charles and I were going to build a deck on this very spot this summer. When I noticed that they appeared to be finishing up I had gone back in. When Kevin walked out, I thought, here we go, time to dump another 10k tons of pain on me. I wasn't wrong. Moira told me she thinks she is 6 weeks pregnant. She didn't want me finding out from someone else or at a sensitive moment. She felt she owed it to me to tell me herself. I asked, ""Was that an accident or was the waiting until 30 rule only for me.""

She looked sad, I saw that little quiver in her lip, ""We want a family now, I went off birth control the same day I moved in, I'm so sorry for how this all happened."" I sat down on the couch, she took a step towards me then stopped. She turned and went for the front door. So much suffering, I couldn't hold it in, ""Was I just a placeholder. Is Charles who you always wanted? Did you pick me because it meant you'd get to be around him? I just don't understand, you've been in each other's lives for years. I've never suspected anything, the most he's ever said about you that would lead me to think anything was that I am a lucky man. I just don't get it."" I had tears again. She turned and ran back over putting her hand on my back. She was direct in tone, ""No, nothing like that, nothing had ever happened between us ever. I loved you, you are amazing, this just HAPPENED, it just happened, I'm sorry, it's so wrong, but we can't stop. I'm so sorry."" At that point she turned and ran out of the house in tears.

I'm left here, alone, picking up the pieces of my own shattered life.

**Part 3**

I figure most of you have never heard my story.

I (Eric 35M) was betrayed by my best friend Charles (35M) and my then wife Moira (33F).

In the years since then I have tried to move on and have a life. I just can't get past what happened. These two I cared for more than anyone or anything else in my life. I was a good friend and a great husband. They even said so themselves.

If this can happen despite me doing ""everything right"" how can I ever trust anyone again. I haven't been able to. I have attempted to date a few times, each time I have sabotaged the relationship from the start. My mind can't help but think the worst. To give an example I was dating this woman, Amelia. We were really hitting it off in those 3 weeks. She canceled plans on me late one night but said she would message me later. I sent a few intrusive texts asking where she was going and why so last minute? She ignores me that night and I have a panic attack. The next day she asked me out to lunch and while we were there she told me she felt I came on a little strong and controlling the night before. She had a family situation and it wasn't really my business considering we've only been dating 3 weeks. I broke down a bit and told her I had some past trauma that left me with extreme trust issues. I said I was sorry but she decided to end things, saying she wasn't in the place for that kind of relationship given her own dealing with past exes. This is pretty much how all my dates end eventually.

I don't really have friends anymore. Most of my mutual friends with Charles or Moira chose me and cut them off when the whole situation went down. I was broken though, I didn't want to do much, I appreciated the few pop ins and calls. I just wasn't the same person. Eventually I drifted from them all. Some of them even went back to being friends with THEM.

I've done well at work, there's nothing to distract me from work. I am in incredible physical shape. Therapy has not worked, I've been to 3 different therapists. I see my family when I can but they can only do so much.

That brings me to the point of this update. I ran into Charles and Moira. I went to the mall recently. The holiday season is usually the only time I ever go there.

I came out of a store, turned right, and there they were. Two sons with them. One looked to be about 5, the other in a stroller about 2. We met eyes, and I froze. Moira just said, ""Eric. "" I turned and went the complete opposite direction at that point.

As I was fleeing, I heard a fast approach and Charles yelled, ""Eric, wait please!"" I don't know why but I stopped. Moira and their 2 kids were still back standing in front of the store, I could see concern on her face.

Charles began, ""I know it doesn't mean much, but I can't say how sorry I am still. We still think about you, we still hurt for what we did to you. I know you can't forgive us nor do we deserve it. I, I just, let me start over, I ran into your brother, maybe 6 months ago. I asked about you and he had some choice words for me. He was always a hot head (he chuckled and looked at me sheepishly, I think hoping I would respond in any way). He told me that we destroyed you. That you haven't moved on, you have a hard time meeting people, dating, he really chewed into me and told me what a piece of shit I was. I hate seeing you like this, I'm sorry, please get help. You deserve everything and more. Don't let what happened consume the rest of your life, please."" He choked up during that last sentence.

I had been looking down while I listened, but at that point I decided to look up into his eyes. ""Are you happy?"" He looked stunned, ""Yes, we are happy. But we still hurt for what happened.""

I said, ""You hurt?"" He got this really apprehensive look on his face.

I continued, ""I sit around thinking of what analogy I can use to describe what this is like.  This is the best I can come up with.  Imagine you are out hiking and you come to a high cliff.  You can see the rocks, bushes below.  You are with the two most important people in your life.  They decide they want to jump, but they don’t just jump.  They each grab you by the arms and jump pulling you with them.  You have a broken back, both legs have to be amputated, severe internal injuries. The other two, just a few scrapes and bruises. They’ll be fine in no time, you however are changed for life. There is no going back to the way you were, whole parts of you are gone forever. That’s how I feel, so please don’t tell me about how much you hurt.""

I walked away at that point. They didn't follow, didn't try to talk. Just another day in hell.

**Part 4**

I (Eric 59M) attended my 40 year High School reunion. I can't believe that much time has passed. I have so little to show for it. I have money, and that's about it. I could retire any moment but I don't because then I don't know what I would do with myself. I gave up on finding someone a long time ago.

After my last post, I sulked for 2 more years. My family was pressuring me to get out there. So I did. I was wealthy, I was fit. I had no trouble meeting women. I just didn't feel anything for them. We would date for a while. I wouldn't freak out like I used to, I just wouldn't commit to anything. Not really, anyway, I always kept myself closed off, sex was fine, feelings weren't. They'd always pick up on this and things would end.

As I passed 40, my family really intervened. It seemed like everyone in my life, which wasn't many people, wanted to set me up with the future Mrs. Stan (my last name). I realized I should try. I met a woman, Trish, she was nice, and driven. I put the effort in to act like I thought I should. She was no dummy though, she could tell I wasn't really in. It came to a head in a big argument about a year in. That was my last relationship, 16 years ago.  I have just never been able to trust anyone after what happened.  

My little brother died 2 years ago. I still miss him. My parents have been gone for a few years now too.

I think these are the things that made me go to the reunion in the first place. After all this time, I needed to socialize, even for only a night. I was not going to go at all out of fear that Charles (59M) and Moira (57F) would be there. But I got over it.

For the most part it was a relatively tame evening. I conversed with a few people I remembered from high school, but mostly spent a large amount of time sitting at a table by myself.

As the night wound on Dukes came by and sat next to me. We weren't close friends back in HS but he was always friendly, man could talk to anyone. That's probably why he took up the mantle of organizing this thing.

Dukes, ""Man, Eric, you've barely aged a day it seems. We're all pushing 60 and you look like you're south of 40."" 

Me, ""Yeah, I hear that all the time. I take care of myself, and I'm lucky, I can't remember the last time I was sick.""

Dukes, ""Guess old Chuck couldn't make it after all?"" 

I looked at him a little surprised, ""I guess not, we haven't spoken in some time now, was he supposed to?""

Dukes, ""Oh, my apologies, I remembered you two were tight back in the day, I figured you still were since he called me to ask if you had RSVP'D.""

Me, ""He did? Did he say anything else?""

Dukes, ""Not much, just wanted to see if you had, said he was deciding if he was coming, and wanted to see what your status was before he committed, had me put him down as maybe."" (I knew now he wouldn't show. We had ran into each other one other time about 10 years ago, and that time we both turned and ran away)

Dukes continued, ""Well he's doing well for himself, I saw on Facebook he got a couple of grand kids now, and is closing in on retirement. Good for him.""

This is where I went pain shopping, ""I don't, um, have social media, can you show me how Charles is doing, like I said we lost touch a few years back?"".

Dukes, ""Oh, yeah, let's check it out."" He pulled his phone out and clicked on the app, searched for Charles. Then he saw someone in the crowd. He just handed me his phone and said, ""Have a look, I need to go talk to somebody I'll come back over in a minute or two.""

I thanked him, then scrolled. He was gone for 10 minutes or so. In that time I saw a lot. Years of smiling photos, holidays and vacations. They had 3 kids, and 2 grandkids, and their daughter was currently pregnant with twins. Saw my ex in laws. Birthday messages, my once upon a time FIL had a post calling Charles ""The best son in law a man could ask for."" I saw events and parties with old friends. It was the life I was supposed to have.

I left shortly after. A few days later I got a call from Dukes. He was apologizing profusely for his faux paus in bringing up Charles. I guess after I left someone who was in the know told him what had gone on between Charles and I. Dukes was a nice man. He didn't have to call but he did. He ended the call like everyone always does, ""If you need anything don't hesitate to ask.""

Like everyone else who hears this, there was never anything to ask for, because no one can make your memories go away or stop your heart from hurting. They say time heals all, but for me, time just makes it worse.

**Part 5**

I can't believe even after all this time, they still find ways to pop back into my life. It's been a lot of years since I updated this post. A part of the story permanently ended recently.

I (Eric 76M) live a very routine life. I have been mostly alone for the last 48 years. I made a ton of money by being a workaholic, and rarely spending any of it. I still work out regularly, and often get mistaken for a man in his early 50's.

I awoke this morning, had breakfast, worked out, watched a movie. This is typical. On most days I go for a walk around noon, especially here in February when it's colder. I leave out of my apartment and head towards a cemetery nearby. I like walking the paths and enjoying the peace. Sometimes when I walk there's a service going on. I always take paths that go around or away from the services. This cemetery is rather large, and has a number of single lane roads going through its grounds. Often when a service is going on the local funeral homes will put small signs with the deceased's last name on them so that those coming know which way to turn.

As I entered and prepared to walk down my usual paths I noticed the sign said ""Francis"" on it. That is the last name of my former best friend Charles (76M). I decided to walk down that path towards the service. I was not dressed for it, not in my red track suit. But curiosity was winning this day.

I came up on the scene just as it must have ended. People were getting back into cars, and heading back towards me as they exited. I could see a large group, probably immediate family, standing around consoling each other. I just stood and watched from a distance.

Though I was a little ways out, my eyes have always been perfect. I could see that the ""Matriarch"" of the group was my ex-wife Moira. I hadn't so much as seen a picture of her in 15 years, but that was without a doubt a 75 year old version of her.

I began to walk down towards the service.  I have no idea why. As I walked up upon the plot, Moira turned and looked at me. I could tell she recognized me immediately, and did the usual double take I get when running into someone for the first time in awhile.  

She just sighed, and had a bit of defeated look on her face, “Oh, Eric…I..I don’t have it in me to feel guilty today, I just lost my great love, please don’t say anything.”  She turned and headed for the car at that point.

I was about to turn and walk away when a man approached. He walked up hand extended, I shook it. The man said, ""Eric, right? I'm Scott, my Parent's oldest. I don't know how to say this, I know all about your history with my parents. I want you to know they never stopped regretting, at least to some degree, what happened between you all. I hope you'll forgive my mother’s words just now. She’s in a bad place.""

I met his eyes, ""My boy, I understand all too well what it's like to lose your spouse and best friend in one moment."" With that I turned and continued my walk.  I took a circular path so that I’d come back this way when they were all gone.  

I stopped by the headstone. It read:

In Loving Memory  
Charles P. Francis.  
10/6/1995 - 2/14/2072.  
Beloved Husband and Father

I guess that’s it.  Charles is gone, “karma” never came for him. 

**Part 6**

Today is the 10 year anniversary of Moira's passing. I (Eric 99M) actually took the effort to print out her obituary:

""Moira Mackenzie Francis passed away after a long battle with breast cancer on May 5th, 2085 at the age of 88. She was born to Sean and Theresa Thomas. After college she became a teacher, and later had a long and prominent career as the Superintendent of Schools for the West Cheshire School District.

Moira was married to Charles P. Francis from January 1st, 2025 to his passing on 2/14/2072. She is survived by her 3 children: Scott, Henry, and Jeanie. Her 6 Grandchildren: Warren, Robert, Alex, Lorna, Aurora, and Kurt. And her 8 Great Grandchildren: Logan, Sean, Rachel, Bishop, Elizabeth, Katherine, Alison, and Peter.

Moira loved to spend time with her family, and volunteer throughout the community. Services will be held at Wilson Funeral home on May 8th at 10am. She will be laid to rest next to her husband at Frost Cemetery.""

I have read this thing way too many times over the last decade.  It’s just not fair.  Why wasn’t I enough, why couldn’t we have this life.  Charles would have found his own life, but for them to take this from me.  We could have all had this.  It’s not fair.

The worst part of this life is it is never ending. I went for my routine physical a couple months ago.  I am in peak shape, the doctor says I have the body of a man around 40 years younger.  My eyes are perfect, my hearing is perfect, my mind is sharp.  Just another way I am punished.  I just want to die.  If you won’t let me die, please just let my mind go.  I hope everyday for Alzheimer's, or for dementia.  Anything to take the memories away.  I don’t want this, I never wanted this, it would have been more humane for them to kill me that day in Charles house than endure a lifetime of this misery.  Why, why can’t I just die.

Welcome back everybody to Reddit Live here on my channel “BORU Century”, I am your host with the most Wade.  

I want to thank u/EnSabahNerd for their help updating this, and thanks to u/Gwen_Luvs_A_Dbl for the original BORU. She has probably passed on by now but if not, thank you. Remember no one here is OOP, so don’t comment on the original posts.

You can read the story of Eric above, as he posted it on Reddit over a span of 70 YEARS, that has to be a record right?  Anyway I am taking special interest in this one.  I do encourage you to read the heartbreaking tale of Eric and his betrayal at the hands of his best friend Charles and wife Moira.  

I was recently checking out [DisturbingWorldRecords.com](https://disturbingworldrecords.com/) when I noticed the name Eric Nathanial Stan. According to their records, on 8/12/2102 at the age of 106 years old, Eric Stan became the oldest person to ever die by non-assisted suicide.  I think this Eric is the same Eric that created these posts.  Neighbors when interviewed were amazed to find out how old Eric actually was, believing him to be a man in his late 60s or early 70s.  His apartment was immaculately clean, and had no décor, no mementos, and no pictures except one.  When emergency personnel were processing the scene, they found 3 items on the coffee table.  An obituary for a Charles Francis from 2072, an obituary for a Moira Francis from 2085, and a framed wedding photo featuring a bride in the middle, with an arm around a man in a tux on each side of her. They are all smiling.  I guess time doesn’t heal all wounds.",5,1747222857.0,Fiction_Stories,1,1.0,False

I will continually update this post as I do more research/to reflect changes based on feedback in the comments. Thanks!

**PART 1: COPENHAGEN** \- I'm planning to get the 72h Copenhagen card.

**Day 1: Nyhavn, Tivoli Gardens**

1 pm: landing in Copenhagen, heading straight to my hotel - hoping to book within the next day or two - any suggestions for best location to stay??

2:30 pm (roughly): Lunch - would love any recommendations (is Nyhavn a bad/overpriced place to have lunch? Is it a good place to stay?)

3:30-6 pm: I am thinking about either exploring the following on foot: Nyhavn, Amalienborg Palace, Frederik’s Church, The Little Mermaid statue and nearby harbor area OR booking a canal tour (either the 1 hour or 2 hour option) and then exploring on foot with my remaining time before heading to the Tivoli Gardens. I've seen someone recommend [https://www.heycaptain.dk/](https://www.heycaptain.dk/) and I was thinking this might be a good way to make friends on the first day as I'm traveling on my own?

6 pm: Take bus to Tivoli Gardens, activate the Copenhagen Card here, explore for the next 3-4 hours. (I want to get both daytime and nighttime views.) Is it worth it to ride the rides? I know they're an added expense. Also I was thinking I would get dinner inside Tivoli - although does anyone know with the Copenhagen card if I can leave and re-enter the same place more than once?

**Day 2: Museums, deer park**

Breakfast and coffee - would love any recommendations

Morning into early afternoon: visit Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek, National Museum of Denmark, Christiansborg Palace, and Strøget - any of these I should skip? How much time should I allot for each roughly?

Late afternoon: lunch at Torvehallerne Food Market - any recommendations??

After lunch: I really want to see one of the giant troll sculptures while I'm in CPH. It seems like most of them are quite out of the way and hard to get to for the time I have, but there's one in Superkilen Park (“Simon Selfmade”) which seems pretty easy to get to by metro

Evening: Take taxi (30 min) or train (1 hour) to Jægersborg Dyrehave (the deer park!), explore until dark

I haven't seen as many people talk about this place but I love parks/green spaces and deer, and the itinerary was starting to feel very museum heavy - I love museums but I also love being outdoors and want to take advantage of the long days while I'm there! Anyone have experience with the deer park?

**Day 3: Day trip day! Deciding between a few options**

**Option 1: daytime: Kronborg Castle, Malmö, and Lund tour, evening: Louisiana Museum of Modern Art**

I found a roughly 8 hour tour on Viator for Kronborg Castle, Malmö, and Lund. It was about $142 which to me feels a little pricy for what it is - I'm still on the fence about whether or not Malmö and/or Lund are really worth it with the limited amount of time I have. (It's free cancelation/I won't be charged until the day before the trip, so I booked it just to be on the safe side, but I think I'm leaning against this option.) Assuming the tour ends around roughly 5 pm, the plan would be to get dinner afterwards and then take a train to the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art (it closes at 10 pm and the sun sets around 9:30 pm, so I would have plenty of time to explore).

**Option 2: daytime: Kronborg Castle, Louisiana Museum of Modern Art, evening: CPH museums or dinner in Malmö**

Both of these places are included in the Copenhagen card, so I was thinking I could just go by train and save a whole lot of money and get to go at my own pace. If I get done early enough, I could visit the David Collection afterwards (open until 9 pm on Weds) or the current exhibit at the Cisterne. I think I am leaning this option but would love any thoughts. I could also hop over to Malmö for dinner - I think the biggest attraction about Malmö for me is just the idea that it's SO close it seems a shame not to go for even a little bit.

**Option 3: Malmö & Lund, evening: Louisiana Museum of Modern Art or CPH museums**

Explore Malmö & Lund in the morning and afternoon, then take a train to the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art (although this feels like a hell of a commute). Alternately, I guess, the David Collection or the Cisterne at night instead of the Louisiana Museum.

**Day 4: Partial day in Copenhagen and evening flight to Edinburgh**

Morning: Breakfast and coffee; visit the David Collection (if I don't get a chance to the day before) and the Design Museum

Afternoon: explore Christianshavn and maybe Freetown Christiania (is this worth visiting?); if I don't get to do a canal tour on day 1, maybe this would be a good time to do that

My flight to Edinburgh is at 7 pm, so I'm thinking wrap everything up and head back to my hotel by 4 pm, and head to the airport around 4:30 (arrive at airport 5 pm). I do need to figure out a situation re: stowing my luggage until 4 pm if my hotel/accommodations doesn't allow that after I check out.

**PART 2: EDINBURGH AND SCOTTISH HIGHLANDS - still doing research but would love suggestions on things to do in Edinburgh!**

Day 5: Full day in Edinburgh

Day 6: Scottish Highlands - planning to book a 3 day tour

Day 7: Scottish Highlands

Day 8: Scottish Highlands

Day 9: Full day in Edinburgh

Day 10: Flight home in the morning OR another full day in Edinburgh? Open to feedback on this - how much time do I need to explore Edinburgh? I don't want to feel regrets that I missed out on anything major or feel rushed to squeeze everything in, especially towards the end of the trip when I might be a bit tired, so I think I am leaning towards 3 days in Edinburgh rather than 2, but not sure yet.

Day 11 (TBD): Flight home if I opt for an extra day in Edinburgh

Would love to get specific recommendations for Edinburgh as well as any restaurant/cafe/bakery recommendations for both Copenhagen and Edinburgh!

Also some additional context relevant to this subreddit: I am a solo female traveler in my early 30s, South Asian and brown skinned with an American passport. This is my second ever fully solo trip, though I've traveled to Europe several times before. Is there anything I should be aware of with the current political climate, or any safety tips I need to be keeping in mind?

1kmcvd2,https://youtu.be/InassjWDxgs,3 Very Scary TRUE Camping in the Desert Horror Stories,"**“Night of the Desert Coyotes”:**

I was camping in the Nevada desert with my friend Jake and his cousin Emily. We found a flat spot near a cluster of scruffy bushes and a few twisted Joshua trees, perfect for our two tents. We’d spent the day hiking through rocky canyons, so we were exhausted and starving. Over a small campfire, we cooked a big meal—hot dogs, baked beans, and some corn on the cob. The smell of food filled the air, and we laughed about how good it felt to eat after a long day. We stacked the dirty pot, plates, and leftover scraps in a pile outside, planning to clean up in the morning. That was our first mistake.Around 1 AM, I jolted awake in my tent. Something was moving outside—rustling, then a low, guttural growl that sent a chill down my spine. My sleeping bag felt too tight, my heart already thumping. I unzipped it and sat up, listening. The noises grew sharper: sniffing, scraping, and a weird yipping sound, like animals talking to each other. I crawled to Jake’s tent, a few feet away, and hissed, “Jake, wake up! There’s something out there.”He groaned, his voice thick with sleep. “What? It’s probably just a rabbit or something. Go back to bed.”“No, listen,” I said, my voice shaking. “It’s big. Multiple things.” Emily stirred in her sleeping bag next to him, mumbling, “What’s going on?”The noises got louder—a clatter as the cooking pot tipped over, followed by more growls. My stomach twisted. “That’s no rabbit,” I said. We grabbed our flashlights and unzipped Jake’s tent flap just enough to peek out. In the faint glow of the dying campfire, we saw three coyotes. Their eyes glinted like coins, and their fur was matted, ribs poking through. The biggest one had a jagged scar across its face, its lips curled back to show yellow teeth. They were tearing into our leftover food, ripping apart the corn cobs and licking the bean-smeared plates.“Oh no,” Emily whispered, her voice trembling. “Those are coyotes. They look starving.”“Yeah, and they’re eating our mess,” Jake said, his eyes wide. “Why didn’t we clean up?”I swallowed hard. I’d heard coyotes usually avoid people, but these ones were bold, probably drawn by the food smell. “We gotta scare them off,” I said. “They’re way too close.”Jake nodded, gripping his flashlight. “Okay, on three, we make noise. Ready?” Emily clutched a water bottle, looking unsure but nodding. “One, two, three!” Jake shouted, “Hey! Get out of here!” He banged the flashlight against the water bottle, and Emily joined in, yelling, “Shoo! Go away!”The coyotes froze, their heads snapping toward us. For a second, I thought it worked. Then the scarred one took a step forward, snarling, its teeth clicking together. The others followed, their claws scratching the dirt. “Oh crap, they’re not scared,” Jake said, his voice cracking. “They’re mad.”“Back inside, now!” I said, yanking the flap shut. We zipped it tight, but it felt flimsy against those teeth. The coyotes started circling the tents, their growls mixing with high-pitched yips that made my skin crawl. One pawed at my tent, its claws snagging the fabric with a soft rip. “They’re trying to get in,” Emily said, her voice barely a whisper. “What do they want?”“The food smell’s all over,” I said, kicking myself for leaving the dishes out. “They think there’s more.” My hands shook as I fumbled through my backpack, looking for anything to distract them. I found a granola bar. “Maybe if we throw this out, they’ll go for it?”“Worth a shot,” Jake said. We unzipped my tent flap just enough to toss the bar a few feet away. The coyotes pounced, snarling and snapping at each other over the wrapper. But it didn’t last. The scarred one lifted its head, staring right at us, then lunged at Jake’s tent. Its teeth caught the corner, tearing a long gash. We screamed, scrambling to the back of the tent, tripping over sleeping bags.“They’re gonna get in!” Emily said, her voice high with panic. The coyote kept pawing, its snout pushing through the rip, hot breath filling the air. Jake grabbed a hiking boot and threw it, hitting the coyote’s nose. It yelped and backed off, but only for a moment. The others joined in, scratching and biting at both tents now. The sound of ripping nylon was deafening, like the desert itself was tearing apart.“We can’t stay here,” I said, my heart pounding so hard it hurt. “They’re not stopping.”“The car,” Jake said. “It’s maybe sixty yards. We run for it.”Emily shook her head, her eyes wide. “They’ll chase us!”“We don’t have a choice,” I said. “Stay here, and they’re in. We go together, fast.” I grabbed my shoes, hands trembling so bad I could barely tie them. Jake found a stick he’d used for the fire, holding it like a club. “On three,” I said. “Stay close. One, two, three!”We burst out of Jake’s tent, screaming to scare them. The coyotes froze for a split second, then charged, their yips turning into wild howls. My legs burned as I sprinted, dirt kicking up under my feet. I heard Emily stumble behind me, gasping, “They’re right there!” I grabbed her arm, pulling her along. Jake swung the stick, yelling, “Back off!” as the scarred coyote snapped at his heels.The car felt a million miles away, its outline barely visible in the dark. My lungs screamed, but I kept running, the coyotes’ claws pounding closer. Jake reached the car first, fumbling with the keys. “Come on, come on!” I shouted, shoving Emily toward the passenger door. The scarred coyote leaped, its teeth grazing my backpack as I dove into the back seat. Jake slammed the driver’s door just as another coyote hit the window, its jaws leaving a smear of spit on the glass.Jake started the engine, hands shaking. “Hold on!” he yelled, flooring it. The car lurched forward, tires spinning in the dirt. The coyotes chased for a few seconds, their eyes glowing in the headlights, then fell back, disappearing into the dark. We didn’t stop until we hit a paved road, the three of us panting, too scared to speak.Finally, Emily broke the silence. “I thought we were dead. Those things… they weren’t normal.”“They were hungry,” I said, my voice hoarse. “And we left a buffet out there.”Jake gripped the wheel, his knuckles white. “Never again. We clean every scrap next time, or I’m not camping.”“Deal,” I said, my heart still racing. We drove to a gas station, waiting for daylight. When we returned at dawn, the campsite was a wreck. Both tents were shredded, the pot dented, and our gear scattered like confetti. Claw marks crisscrossed the dirt, and a tuft of matted coyote fur stuck to a bush. The sight made my stomach churn. We packed what we could and left, vowing to never be so careless again. In the desert, one mistake can turn a quiet night into a nightmare.





**“Drunk Javelinas in the Desert”:**  
I was out camping in the desert with my friends, Tom and Lisa, just the three of us looking to escape the city for a weekend. We found a spot near a dry riverbed, a wide, flat patch of ground surrounded by scraggly bushes and a few twisted Joshua trees. It felt remote, perfect for unplugging. We pitched our tents in a loose circle, set up a small folding table, and built a fire with wood we’d brought. As the flames crackled, we sat in our camp chairs, sipping beers from a six-pack, munching on chips, and swapping stories about old road trips. The air smelled of smoke and dust, and we were happy, relaxed. We left the empty cans, a half-eaten bag of chips, and some granola bars on the table, not thinking it mattered. By midnight, we were yawning, so we doused the fire and crawled into our tents, zipping up for the night.I don’t know how long I’d been asleep when I woke to strange noises—grunting, snuffling, and the sharp clink of metal. My heart jumped, and I lay still, trying to make sense of it. The sounds were close, right outside my tent. I grabbed my flashlight, my hands shaky, and unzipped the tent flap just enough to peek out. In the faint glow of the fire’s leftover embers, I saw them: five or six javelinas, those wild pig-like animals with coarse, bristly fur and short, sharp tusks. They were at our table, their snouts buried in the mess we’d left. One was lapping up beer from a tipped-over can, its tongue making wet, sloppy sounds. Another was chewing on the chip bag, plastic crinkling as it tore it apart. Their eyes caught the light, glinting like tiny mirrors, and their bodies—low and stocky—blended into the shadows.“Tom! Lisa!” I whispered, loud enough to reach their tents but not wanting to spook the animals. “Wake up, quick!”“What’s going on?” Lisa’s voice came from her tent, groggy but tense.“Javelinas,” I said, keeping my eyes on them. “They’re eating our stuff… and drinking the beer.”“Drinking?” Tom unzipped his tent, his head poking out. “Oh, man, look at them. They’re wrecking everything.”The javelinas weren’t acting normal. One stumbled sideways, its hooves scraping the dirt, and bumped into another, which snapped its jaws with a loud clack. The big one, maybe the leader, was guzzling from a can it had crushed with its snout. I’d heard javelinas could be bold, but this was different. They were drunk, I realized, from the beer we’d left out. Their movements were sloppy, unpredictable—one swayed, then charged a nearby cactus, ramming it with a thud, spines sticking to its hide. Another started rooting at the ground near Lisa’s tent, its tusks gouging the dirt, making a horrible grinding sound.“We gotta scare them off,” Tom said, his voice low but urgent. “They’re way too close.”“How?” Lisa asked, her words clipped. “They’re not acting right.”“Make noise,” I said, remembering something about startling animals. “Grab anything loud.”I fumbled in my bag, pulling out a metal spoon and a small cooking pot. Tom found his flashlight and a water bottle, and Lisa grabbed a pair of trekking poles. We started banging—me clanging the spoon against the pot, Tom smacking the bottle with his flashlight, Lisa tapping the poles together. The noise was sharp, echoing off the rocks, but the javelinas barely flinched. One looked up, its head wobbling, then went back to ripping the granola bar wrappers. The big one, though, stopped digging and turned toward my tent. Its snout twitched, nostrils flaring, and it let out a deep, guttural grunt that made my skin crawl.“It’s looking at me,” I whispered, my mouth dry. “It’s not scared.”“Keep banging!” Tom said, hitting his bottle harder. “Maybe they’ll get annoyed.”We kept at it, the clanging and tapping filling the air, but the javelinas only seemed to get bolder. The big one took a step toward my tent, its hooves crunching the gravel. Then another step. My heart was pounding so hard I could feel it in my throat. I gripped the pot like a shield, but it felt useless. Lisa’s tent was next, and one of the smaller javelinas was pawing at it, its tusks catching the nylon, making little ripping sounds.“My tent!” Lisa hissed. “It’s gonna tear it open!”“Stay calm,” I said, though I wasn’t calm at all. “Maybe they’ll lose interest.”But they didn’t. The big one was close now, maybe five feet from my tent, its head low, eyes locked on the flap. Then it charged. The ground shook as it hit, its body slamming into the tent’s side. The fabric buckled, poles bending, and I fell back, scrambling to the far corner. My flashlight rolled away, its beam spinning across the tent walls. The javelina grunted again, louder, and I heard its tusks scrape the nylon, like nails on a chalkboard.“It’s gonna get in!” I yelled, my voice cracking. I grabbed the only thing I could think of—a can of insect repellent from my backpack. I didn’t know if it would work, but I was out of options. I leaned toward the flap, hands trembling, and sprayed a burst through the opening, aiming for its face. The hiss of the can was loud, and the sharp, chemical smell hit the air. The javelina squealed, a high-pitched sound, and jerked back, shaking its head like it was stung.“Did it work?” Tom called, still banging his bottle.“I think so!” I sprayed again, sweeping the mist toward another javelina that was getting too close. It snorted and stumbled, tripping over a rock, its legs wobbly from the beer. The others started to react, too—one backed away from Lisa’s tent, sneezing and pawing at its nose. But they weren’t leaving. The big one circled back, slower now, and rammed the table instead, sending cans, wrappers, and our plastic plates crashing to the ground. The noise was deafening, like a car wreck in the quiet desert.“We can’t stay like this,” Lisa said, her voice shaking. “They’re destroying everything.”“Just hold on,” I said, clutching the repellent like a lifeline. “Maybe they’ll tire out.”I sprayed again, aiming at the group near the table. The mist caught a couple of them, and they squealed, staggering away. But the big one was stubborn, grunting and swaying, its tusks glinting as it faced my tent again. I was about to spray when it stopped, swayed hard, and collapsed, its legs folding under it. One by one, the others followed, dropping to the dirt with heavy thuds. Their grunts turned to soft wheezes, then snores. They were out cold, sprawled across the campsite like drunks after a party.“Are they dead?” Lisa asked, her voice barely above a whisper.“No,” I said, my pulse still racing. “Drunk. Passed out from the beer.”We didn’t move for what felt like hours, just watching from our tents, too scared to step out. The fire was gone, just a pile of ash now, and the javelinas looked like dark, furry lumps in the dim light. Their snores were uneven, and every so often, one would twitch, making us jump. My tent smelled of repellent, and my hands were sticky from gripping the can so tight.“Do we just wait?” Tom asked, his voice hoarse.“Yeah,” I said. “Until they’re gone.”We stayed put until the sky started to lighten, the horizon turning gray. The javelinas began to stir, grunting softly as they struggled to their feet. The big one was last, shaking its head like it had a headache. They didn’t look at us, just wandered off into the brush, their hooves crunching faintly until the sound faded. We waited another ten minutes, just to be sure, before stepping out.The campsite was a mess. The table was flipped, legs bent. My tent had a tear where the javelina hit, about a foot long, flapping in the quiet. The ground was torn up, dirt and rocks scattered from their digging. Cans were crushed, wrappers shredded, and the chip bag was just scraps. We started cleaning, moving slowly, still shaken.“That was too close,” Tom said, picking up a mangled can. “We should’ve locked everything in the car.”“Or used a cooler,” Lisa added, her face pale as she stuffed trash into a bag. “I thought they’d just eat and leave.”“I didn’t know they’d drink,” I said, folding my torn tent. “Who leaves beer out for javelinas?”We laughed, but it was nervous, the kind of laugh you force when you’re still scared. Packing up took longer than it should have, our hands clumsy, eyes darting to the brush every time we heard a noise. The drive out was quiet, the desert stretching around us, empty and calm again. But I kept seeing those eyes, those tusks, the way the tent shook when it charged. We’d been careless, and it nearly cost us. I knew one thing for sure: I’d never camp in the desert without checking every scrap of food twice.







**“Eyes in the Desert”:**

I was hiking in the Sonoran Desert near Tucson, Arizona, with my friend Alex and his cousin, Jenna. We’d been planning this trip for weeks, excited to explore a lesser-known trail that promised stunning views of the desert’s rugged beauty. The trailhead was a good hour’s drive from the city, and we’d packed plenty of water, granola bars, and a first-aid kit, just in case. The three of us were in high spirits, laughing and chatting as we set out, our boots crunching on the gravelly path. The landscape was breathtaking—towering saguaro cacti, their arms reaching skyward, patches of prickly pear, and mesquite bushes dotting the sandy terrain. I felt alive, soaking in the vastness of it all.We’d been hiking for about two hours, following a narrow trail that wound through rocky outcrops and dry washes. I was leading the way, picking my steps carefully to avoid loose stones, while Alex and Jenna trailed behind, debating whether we’d spot any wildlife. “Maybe a roadrunner,” Jenna said, her voice light. “Or one of those cute little lizards.”“Keep your eyes peeled,” Alex teased. “You never know what’s out here.”I smiled, scanning the ground for any sign of movement. That’s when I heard it—a low, guttural growl, like a dog but deeper, more primal. It came from somewhere to my left, hidden in the brush. My heart lurched, and I froze mid-step, one foot hovering above the trail. “Stop,” I said, my voice barely above a whisper. “Did you hear that?”Alex and Jenna went quiet, their footsteps halting. “What was it?” Jenna asked, her tone suddenly serious.“Shh,” Alex said, stepping closer to me. We stood there, straining to listen. The growl came again, closer now, a rumbling sound that sent a chill down my spine despite the warmth around us. My eyes darted to the left, where a cluster of mesquite bushes and creosote shrubs formed a dense thicket. Then I saw them—two yellow eyes glinting from the shadows, low to the ground, locked onto us. The shape of a large animal emerged, its tawny fur blending seamlessly with the desert. A mountain lion.My stomach dropped. “It’s a cougar,” I said, my voice trembling. I’d seen pictures of them before, but nothing prepared me for the real thing—sleek, muscular, maybe six feet long with a thick tail that twitched like it was sizing us up.Jenna gasped softly. “Oh my gosh, what do we do?”“Don’t move,” Alex said, his voice low but firm. “They go for you if you run.”My legs felt like they might give out. I’d read about mountain lions in Arizona—how they’re stealthy predators, able to leap 20 feet or more and take down prey twice their size. There were stories of attacks, like the hiker in California who’d been mauled while jogging, his face torn open before he fought the lion off. Or the cyclist in Washington killed by a cougar, his body found off the trail. Those stories felt distant until now, when I was staring into the eyes of one.The lion took a slow step forward, its paws silent on the ground, muscles rippling under its fur. It was maybe 30 feet away, close enough that I could see the whiskers on its muzzle and the way its ears twitched. My mouth went dry, and my heart was pounding so hard I thought it might burst. “We need to do something,” I said, trying to keep my voice steady. “It’s too close.”“Make ourselves big,” Alex said, his eyes never leaving the lion. “Raise your arms, yell at it. We need to scare it off.”“Are you sure?” Jenna asked, her voice shaking. “What if that makes it mad?”“It’s our best shot,” Alex said. “Cougars don’t like groups or loud noises.”I didn’t want to yell—every instinct screamed to stay quiet and not draw attention—but I trusted Alex. He’d grown up in Tucson and knew more about the desert than I did. “Okay,” I said, swallowing hard. “On three. One, two, three.”We raised our arms high, waving them slowly to look bigger. “Hey! Get out of here!” I shouted, my voice cracking with fear. “Go on, get!”“Back off!” Alex yelled, his voice booming. “We’re not your lunch!”Jenna joined in, her voice higher-pitched but fierce. “Go away! Leave us alone!”The lion froze, its ears flattening slightly, but it didn’t retreat. Instead, it lowered its head, letting out another growl that made my skin crawl. The sound was deep, vibrating in my chest, and it felt like a warning. My hands were sweating, and I could feel my knees trembling. “It’s not working,” I said, panic creeping into my voice. “It’s still there.”“Keep going,” Alex said, his tone urgent. “Louder. And grab something—a stick, a rock, anything.”I bent down slowly, keeping my eyes on the lion, and fumbled for a rock on the trail. My fingers closed around a jagged stone the size of an orange, but my hands were shaking so badly I nearly dropped it. Jenna picked up a broken branch, clutching it like a club. The lion took another step closer, now maybe 20 feet away, its body low and tense, like it was ready to pounce. I could see the power in its legs, the way its claws dug into the dirt.“Throw the rock,” Alex said, his voice tight. “Not at it—near it. Make noise.”I nodded, my heart in my throat, and hurled the rock as hard as I could. It landed a few feet in front of the lion, kicking up a puff of dust. The lion flinched, its head jerking back, and for a moment, I thought it might run. But then it crouched lower, its growl growing louder, and my hope evaporated. “It’s not scared,” I said, my voice breaking. “What now?”“We back away,” Alex said. “Slowly. Don’t turn your back on it, and keep making noise.”“Okay,” Jenna said, her voice barely audible. “But I’m so scared.”“Me too,” I admitted, gripping another rock I’d picked up. “Just stay close.”We started inching backward, step by careful step, keeping our arms raised and our eyes locked on the lion. I kept shouting, “Go away! Get out of here!” but my voice sounded weak, drowned out by the pounding in my ears. Every rustle of leaves, every crunch of gravel under our boots, made me flinch. I imagined the lion leaping, its claws sinking into me before I could react. The trail was narrow, and I nearly tripped over a root, catching myself just in time.“Is it following us?” Jenna asked, her voice trembling as she glanced at the lion.“No,” Alex said, his eyes still fixed on it. “It’s staying put, but don’t stop moving.”We backed up maybe 50 feet, the lion still crouched in the same spot, its yellow eyes tracking us. My arms were aching from holding them up, and my throat was raw from shouting. Finally, the lion’s gaze shifted, and it turned its head, as if distracted by something in the distance. Then, in one fluid motion, it slunk back into the brush, its body disappearing into the shadows. The growling stopped, and the eyes were gone.I let out a shaky breath, lowering my arms. “Is it really gone?” I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.“I think so,” Alex said, still staring at the thicket. “But we need to get out of here. Now.”We turned and moved quickly down the trail, our paces faster than before. I kept glancing over my shoulder, half-expecting to see those eyes again, the lion stalking us silently. My legs felt heavy, like I was wading through mud, and my chest was tight with fear. “That was the scariest thing I’ve ever been through,” I said, my voice shaking.“No kidding,” Jenna said, clutching her branch so tightly her knuckles were white. “I thought it was going to jump us.”“It could have,” Alex said, his voice grim. “Cougars are unpredictable. We got lucky.”We didn’t talk much after that, just focused on putting distance between us and that spot. The trail seemed endless, winding through more rocky terrain and dry washes. Every sound—a bird taking flight, a lizard darting across the path—made my heart race. I kept imagining the lion circling around, waiting for us further down the trail. My backpack felt heavier with every step, the straps digging into my shoulders, but I didn’t dare stop to adjust it.It took us nearly two hours to reach the trailhead, and by the time we saw the dusty parking lot and our car, I was exhausted, physically and emotionally. I collapsed into the passenger seat, my hands still trembling as I fumbled with the seatbelt. Alex slid into the driver’s seat, and Jenna climbed in the back, her face pale. We sat there for a moment, the engine idling, none of us speaking.“You okay?” Alex finally asked, glancing at me.“Barely,” I said, rubbing my sweaty palms on my jeans. “I can’t stop seeing those eyes. What if it had attacked?”“Don’t think about that,” Jenna said, though her voice was unsteady. “We’re safe now, right?”“Yeah,” Alex said, but he didn’t sound convinced. “Let’s just get back to town.”The drive back to Tucson was quiet, the desert stretching out endlessly around us. I kept replaying the encounter in my head—the lion’s growl, the way its muscles tensed, the sheer power in its stare. That night, at Alex’s house, I couldn’t sleep. I sat up on the couch, scrolling through articles about mountain lion attacks. One story described a hiker in Arizona who’d been stalked for miles, the cougar trailing him silently until he reached his car. Another detailed a fatal attack in Colorado, where a runner was killed on a popular trail. The articles said attacks are rare—only about 20 fatalities in the U.S. over the past century—but that didn’t make me feel better. Rare or not, we’d come face-to-face with one.“How are you holding up?” Jenna asked the next morning, pouring coffee in the kitchen.“Honestly? I’m a mess,” I said, wrapping my hands around a mug. “I keep hearing that growl in my head.”“Me too,” she said, her eyes tired. “I don’t think I’ll ever hike again.”Alex overheard us and chimed in. “You’ll get past it,” he said, but his tone was softer than usual. “I’m shaken too, but we did everything right. We stayed calm, we didn’t run. That’s why we’re here.”He was right, but it didn’t erase the fear. For months afterward, I couldn’t even walk through a park without checking the bushes. I stopped hiking altogether, sticking to city streets and gyms. Alex and Jenna tried to get me back out, but I couldn’t do it. Alex started carrying a heavy walking stick and an air horn on his hikes, and Jenna bought pepper spray, saying she’d never feel safe without it.That day in the desert changed me. I used to see the wilderness as a place of freedom, a chance to escape the noise of everyday life. Now I know it’s a place where you’re not always in control. The desert is beautiful, but it’s unforgiving, home to creatures that can end you in seconds. Sometimes, when I’m alone at night, I close my eyes and see those yellow eyes staring back at me, hear that low growl echoing in the silence. It’s a reminder of how close we came to something we might not have walked away from, and it’s a sound I’ll carry with me for the rest of my life.",1,1747222518.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

Lately, I’m starting to think I may need to give up caffeine—especially coffee. Every time I drink a cup (or more), I crash within a few hours. The same thing happens when I consume something sugary: I end up feeling absolutely awful, like I haven’t slept in days.

Is anyone else experiencing something similar?

Interestingly, when I replace coffee with green matcha, I feel significantly better. Does anyone know why that might be?

1kmcuk9,https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1kmcuk9/i_wanted_to_share_what_ive_called_the_snap_method/,I wanted to share what I’ve called the snap method,"This idea came to me one morning when I was procrastinating getting up.  I thought “if I could just snap my fingers and be showered/dressed, tidied up, and have everything I need, I would be happy to get started.”

I’ll actually snap my fingers and envision that -  I’m fresh and ready to go, I’ve cleaned up and all that’s left is to start working.

You can even break it out into smaller chunks - “if I could just be showered/teeth brushed, fully dressed…”.  Snap my fingers and envision that, then once I do it all I snap my fingers again and imagine the snap really was all I had to do.  Then do that once more for coffee, breakfast and tidying up, etc. 

I’ll go on autopilot and make sure I’m only doing the things related to the snap I envisioned, focusing on how good it would feel to be ready to go.  Then once completed snap again, it almost tricks your brain into thinking the instant snap worked. 

If your entire focus is on the end “snap” result and you go into an auto-pilot-like state when you’re getting things done it will feel like it was completed in an instant.

Envisioning it lets you see the completed end goal, that it’s attainable, and how good it will feel.

I basically got no complaints about him. He takes care of me so well, loves me alot, do the chores more than me, even brings my coffee to bed everyday.

We shifted to a different country in 2023. We both are not happy here career wise, but this was a stepping stone for us. We will be staying here for another two years maximum before we shift for the better.

Our bedroom life is almost dead, he got some performance issues since last year, and I have been trying to understand it, and help him to overcome it. ( we used to go to gym alot but stopped after moving, so we started it again, getting into hobbies and what not) Last week we tested his testosterone levels and it was on the lower end, but still in the correct range. However, his sugar and cholesterol has skyrocketed for the first time and he is on medication now.

We both come from broken families and have been a team so far, and faced everything together. No big fights ever, maximum 5-8 arguments for the past 3 years, we don't go to bed angry etc.. we usually never hide anything from each other. However, Last year this time i felt he was hiding something and for the first time i checked his phone and noticed him reacting to some insta model's photos. The model also has reacted to his photos/stories. And when i questioned he said he was feeling so down and when she gave him attention by liking his photos he felt good about it. But there was no convos whatsoever, he said he never wanted to go beyond reacting to photos. During that time, i told him if he has lost interest in me or anything he can always tell that to me, we can always be friends and i dont want to have a marriage for the sake of it. Fast forward to today, i saw in threads, his entire feed is girls with stockings ( i dont know showing the legs because that's what he likes) and football. That's about it.

the dr said his sugar and cholesterol needs to go down and the intimacy issue will go away, he is really upset about it, and calls himself a broken man.

We are currently working on his health, and i saw this on his threads feed. I don't use threads.  But he got a profile pic with me in that.

Anyway my question is is this normal? I have told him countless time to watch porn and masterbate because that was something he did regularly before he met me, but he completely stopped it after meeting me.

I just want to know what he may be feeling, or has he lost interest in me.

1kmctn4,https://www.reddit.com/r/FridgeFanatic/comments/1kmctn4/how_does_the_inoviva_k20_nugget_ice_maker_truly/,How does the Inoviva K2.0 nugget ice maker truly rate? Review here!,"Testing out the Inoviva K2.0 nugget ice maker turned into quite the experience in my house. This compact yet powerful machine, measuring just 14.9” x 9.25” x 11.8”, earned itself a permanent spot on my kitchen counter. As someone who loves entertaining and indulging in cold beverages, I found it thrilling to experiment with this countertop ice maker daily. From its quick ice production to its self-cleaning feature, it had plenty to offer, though a few things left me pondering.

**Compact and Convenient Design**  
This ice maker doesn't demand much counter space, which is a big plus for someone like me who has a crowded kitchen. Its sleek black stainless finish blends effortlessly with modern kitchen aesthetics, and the durable build gave me confidence it’d last for the long haul. Setting it up was straightforward. It includes an ice basket, scoop, and three reusable ice bags that simplify storage and handling—a thoughtful touch I didn’t anticipate but quickly appreciated.

**Impressive Ice Production**  
The star feature is its ability to churn out up to 40 lbs of soft, chewable nugget ice within 24 hours. Testing it during a cozy movie night with friends, I was amazed that the first batch was ready within just 10 minutes. The slow-melting ice doesn't water down drinks too quickly, which became a game-changer for the iced coffee I rely on daily. Cocktails and sodas also tasted fresher, thanks to this feature.

[Want the lowest Inoviva K2.0 price? Click Amazon.](https://fridgefanatic.com/p/b0dgpy1jrv/)

**User-Friendly Controls and Self-Cleaning**  
Operating the ice maker is as simple as it gets. The one-touch control panel is intuitive and features indicators for “Add Water” or “Ice Full,” making it almost impossible to mess up. As someone who notoriously forgets appliance maintenance, the self-cleaning option saved me heaps of effort. A 5-minute cycle activated with a 3-second press keeps the machine in pristine condition. This feature added real value, especially for someone who loves convenience.

**Energy Efficiency and Insulation**  
Another feature that stood out was its double-layer insulation. I tested the ice storage by leaving ice in the basket for several hours, and it genuinely melted much slower compared to other machines I’ve used. The efficient compressor managed energy-smart operations, which I found reassuring with my electricity bill in mind.

**Perks**  
- Compact size fits snugly on small countertops.  
- Produces chewable nugget ice, perfect for cooling beverages effectively.  
- Self-cleaning feature makes maintenance a breeze.  

**Pitfalls**  
- At 26.67 pounds, moving the unit around isn’t exactly effortless.  
- The noise during operation, though not extreme, might bother noise-sensitive users.  
- Lacks a water line hookup for automatic water refills.  

**Competing Products**  
When compared to other ice makers in its league—like the GE Profile Opal Nugget Ice Maker—the Inoviva K2.0 offers some stiff competition. It’s more compact, which is great for tighter spaces, yet produces similar-quality nugget ice. However, the GE version has an edge with features like Wi-Fi connectivity. On the other hand, budget-friendly alternatives like the Frigidaire EFIC235 focus on simplicity but fall short in terms of insulation and production speed. The K2.0 really carves out its niche with its combination of compactness and strong insulation properties.

**Worth Every Penny**  
Considering the features stacked against the price, I’d argue this countertop ice maker offers excellent value. The production speed and chewable nugget ice alone make it a worthy investment, especially for frequent entertainers or avid cold beverage drinkers. While it sits on the higher end in weight and lacks advanced connectivity features, its performance offsets these minor compromises.

Here's the list of places we drop off right now - some definitely make more sense than others... we plan on adding more copies to places they go away and reducing copies in places where there are routinely extras at the end of the week, but we're interested in learning about any spots we're missing that people would love to see copies of the paper! If you own a small business and think your customers would benefit from having the paper around, feel free to chime in too! 

Each drop off location costs us $6 per week / \~$300/yr (and we are not yet at cash flow breakeven for our donations/ad revenue vs operating costs), so it's not nothing to add a drop-off location, but at a minimum it would be great to prioritize towards higher impact locations, and maybe also add 15-30 new spots too.

The Majestic Beauty of Mount Kilimanjaro

Mount Kilimanjaro is more than just Africa’s highest peak—it is a symbol of natural grandeur, a beacon of adventure, and a journey through some of the most diverse ecosystems on Earth. Towering at 5,895 meters (19,341 feet), this iconic mountain rises dramatically from the savannah of northern Tanzania, creating a breathtaking silhouette against the African sky.

1. A Crown of Ice Above the Clouds

At the summit, the snow-capped Uhuru Peak gleams with icy brilliance, a surreal contrast to the warm plains below. Seeing the glaciers of Kilimanjaro sparkle under the equatorial sun is an awe-inspiring sight—one of the few places on Earth where snow meets the tropics. From this vantage point above the clouds, climbers witness sunrises that bathe the landscape in golden light, offering a spiritual and unforgettable experience.

2. A Climb Through Five Climate Zones

What makes Kilimanjaro uniquely beautiful is its journey through five distinct ecological zones—from lush rainforest to arctic summit. The ascent begins in the montane forest, alive with the sounds of birds and the rustle of colobus monkeys. Here, moss-draped trees and giant ferns create an enchanted, green world.

As climbers rise, they pass through the moorland zone, where giant groundsels and lobelias add an almost alien beauty. The landscape then shifts to the alpine desert—a stark, wind-swept terrain of volcanic rock and surreal silence—before finally reaching the icy summit.

3. A Natural Wonder Framed by Rich Culture

Surrounding Kilimanjaro is a vibrant mosaic of culture and tradition. The Chagga people, who live on the mountain’s lower slopes, bring warmth and depth to the experience through their hospitality, stories, and heritage. The fertile volcanic soil supports coffee plantations and banana groves, creating a lush, green belt that encircles the mountain.

4. A Sanctuary of Solitude and Discovery

Whether for seasoned trekkers or first-time climbers, Kilimanjaro offers a deep sense of personal challenge and reward. The quiet majesty of the mountain, the ever-changing scenery, and the sheer scale of the journey combine to create a deeply moving and unforgettable adventure.



In essence, Mount Kilimanjaro is not just a destination—it is an experience that stirs the soul, a place where the grandeur of nature and the spirit of exploration meet in harmony. Whether your clients seek adventure, natural beauty, or a transformative journey, Kilimanjaro stands ready to welcome them with open skies and majestic silence.

My mom has three daughters: her baby, her sweetheart, and me—her punching bag.  
  
While she dotes on my two older sisters, all I’ve ever gotten from her is fists and fury.  
  
I once thought I wasn’t her real kid. I even stole a strand of her hair for a DNA test.  
  
The results? Yeah, I’m hers—blood and bone.  
  
Just as she was about to hit me again, my grandmother couldn't bear to watch and stepped in, Mom showed her a video on her phone. After watching it, Grandma immediately went from defending me to screaming, ""Beat her to death!""  
  
Same thing happened with Grandpa.  
  
One look at that video, and he was begging Mom to kill me too.  
  
I really don't understand.  
  
Why does everyone want me dead?  
  
What exactly is in that video on my mother's phone?  
  
\---  
  
""Still breathing, huh?""  
  
""Next time I'll make damn sure you don't wake up!""  
  
These were the first words I heard when I came to—my mother's hollow eyes staring down at me, black and bottomless.  
  
This made hospital visit number twenty. All courtesy of the woman who gave birth to me.  
  
And her reason this time? I'd spilled a few drops of coffee on kitchen counter.  
  
Sounds like ridiculous, but I swear to God, that's all it took.  
  
I stared back at her, searching those dead eyes for even a flicker of the maternal instinct that normal mothers supposedly have.  
  
Nothing. Just pure disgust. Like she was pissed I was still taking up space in her world.  
  
My mother has hated my guts since day one.  
  
In my earliest memories, all she gave me was beating and scolding.  
  
Meanwhile, my two older sisters might as well be living in a different universe. They get whatever they want, whenever they want it.  
  
My mother would affectionately cook all sorts of delicious meals for my two older sisters, but when it came to me, all I was usually left with was stale, hard bread.  
  
Even if I'd only managed a few painful bites, she'd snatch my plate away, muttering, ""Would've done everyone a favor if you'd just starved to death.""  
  
My sisters rocked American Eagle and Hollister while I wore hand-me-downs so faded and worn they belonged in a dumpster.  
  
She even encouraged my sisters to treat me like garbage, rolling their eyes whenever I speak up.  
  
For years, I thought maybe I wasn't really hers. So I went CSI secretly, nabbed a strand of her hair and sent it for DNA testing.  
  
But it turned out that I'm 100% her kid. Biologically speaking, anyway.  
  
This messed me up bad.  
  
I literally made a spreadsheet of possible reasons she might hate me.  
  
Was I some living reminder of my dad cheating?  
  
After low-key stalking my own father for weeks, I concluded he was basically Ward Cleaver—no skeletons in his closet.  
  
So I just... existed. Took the beatings. Year after year.  
  
During this hellish childhood, I tried running to my grandparents for help.  
  
Initially, Grandma was horrified. ""This is an abomination!"" she had yelled at my mother. ""What kind of monster nearly kills her own daughter?""  
  
Mom didn't even bother arguing. She just pulled out her iPhone, tapped the screen a few times, and showed Grandma some video.  
  
After watching whatever the hell was on that phone, Grandma's face went from concerned to terrified. She stopped defending me and instead hissed at my mother, ""Beat her to death! She shouldn't be alive!""  
  
Same thing happened with Grandpa. One look at that video, and he went from protective to practically begging my mother to end my life.  
  
Every single person I've reached out to has seen that damn video, and without fail, they've all had the same reaction: kill her.  
  
Even my sisters just stand there with icy expressions whenever Mom uses me as a punching bag, like they're all just waiting for the day she finally finishes me off.  
  
I really don't understand, why is this happening?  
  
Chapter 2  
  
Thank God for my dad. He's the only one who still treats me like a human being.  
  
But with his job taking him out of town constantly, I'm still at Mom's mercy whenever he's gone.  
  
Somehow, I've survived this long.  
  
Lying in that hospital bed, with my entire body feeling like one massive bruise, this empty coldness spread through me.  
  
Mom stood over me, still looking at me like I was something that needed to be exterminated.  
  
I couldn't help myself. ""Mom, why do you hate me so much? Just tell me what I did wrong so I can fix it!""  
  
I genuinely wanted to know what my crime was.  
  
But when she met my tear-filled eyes, she just let out this mocking laugh. ""I beat you because I fucking feel like it! Only thing I regret is not finishing the job!""  
  
She said it so casually, like she was discussing the weather, not admitting she wanted her daughter dead.  
  
My hope died right there in that sterile hospital room.  
  
Additionally, I could sense that this time, she had actually tried to kill me.  
  
Thank God I'd managed to call my boyfriend, Adam, before I blacked out.  
  
Suddenly, my thoughts were cut short as the door flew open with a bang.  
  
Adam burst in with three uniformed cops right behind him.  
  
The lead officer stepped forward, slapping handcuffs on my mother's wrists.  
  
""Mrs. Mitchell, you're under arrest for domestic assault. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.""  
  
The cops might as well have been furniture for all my mother cared. Her face remained as cold and unreadable as a poker player with a royal flush.  
  
Adam stared at my battered body and completely lost it.  
  
""What the actual fuck is wrong with you?!"" he shouted at my mother, his face flushed with rage. ""Is Emma even your biological kid? Because I've seen crack addicts treat stray dogs better than you treat your own daughter!""  
  
""You sick, twisted witch—you don't deserve to be called a mother!""  
  
Adam's hands were balled into white-knuckled fists, trembling with the effort it took not to swing at her. I could tell the only thing stopping him was that unwritten rule about not hitting women.  
  
Knowing someone still had my back made the pain fade, just a little.  
  
The lead officer stepped forward. ""Ma'am, I'm going to need you to explain these injuries.""  
  
My mother didn't even acknowledge him. Just stared straight ahead like he wasn't worth her time.  
  
Adam jumped in, his voice shaking with rage. ""I'll testify. I've seen my girlfriend covered in bruises multiple times. This psycho needs to be locked up before she—""  
  
My mother's laughter cut through the room like a knife.  
  
With calm, she reached into her pocket and pulled out her iPhone, beckoning Adam with one perfectly manicured finger.  
  
""Come here, boy. There's something you should see.""  
  
Chapter 3  
  
Pure panic flooded my system.  
  
I lunged forward, grabbing Adam's sleeve so hard my knuckles turned white.  
  
""Don't!""  
  
My voice came out as a desperate croak.  
  
""Please don't look at it... please...""  
  
I knew what would happen. That cursed video had turned everyone against me. Everyone.  
  
Adam looked down at me, confusion written all over his face.  
  
""Babe, it's okay,"" he said, squeezing my hand. ""I've got you. She can't hurt you anymore.""  
  
But I couldn't let go of his sleeve. I just couldn't risk it.  
  
""Adam, I'm literally begging you. Don't go over there.""  
  
The more freaked out I got, the more I could see his curiosity growing.  
  
Despite my pleas, he gently pried my fingers from his arm and walked toward my mother.  
  
""Whatever mind game you're playing,"" he said, ""I wanna see what the hell kind of video could make anyone okay with beating their kid half to death.""  
  
He took the phone from my mother and started watching.  
  
I stared at his face, clinging to this pathetic little hope that maybe—just maybe—he'd be different. That he'd still love me even after seeing... whatever it was.  
  
I silently pleaded to any god who might be listening, but the universe had ghosted me long ago.  
  
As the video played, Adam's expression morphed from angry to shocked to something else entirely. His eyes grew wider, his face paler. In less than two minutes, everything about him changed.  
  
He said nothing. Just stared at my mother in stunned silence.  
  
My mother gave him a knowing nod.  
  
When Adam finally looked back at me, the love and concern had vanished from his eyes, replaced by something cold and distant. Something that didn't recognize me as the same person anymore.  
  
He handed the phone back to my mother and turned to the cops with an apologetic smile.  
  
""Officers, I'm so sorry for wasting your time. This was all just a big misunderstanding. There's no abuse happening here.""  
  
The officers exchanged skeptical glances, then turned to me.  
  
My heart felt like it was being crushed in a vise. The pain was beyond anything physical my mother had ever inflicted. I looked at Adam—the guy who'd sworn to protect me—knowing that his 180 meant no one would believe me now.  
  
""It was just some roughhousing that got out of hand,"" Adam continued smoothly. ""Family stuff, you know? We can handle this ourselves.""  
  
In the end, with no witness willing to testify, the police uncuffed my mother and filed out of the room, shooting me concerned but helpless glances.  
  
Adam turned to face me, his expression now as cold as my mother's—a chill that cut straight to my soul.  
  
Then, in a move that shattered everything I thought I knew about him, he dropped to his knees in front of my mother.  
  
""Mrs. Mitchell,"" he said, voice trembling with emotion, ""I'm so sorry I didn't understand before. You should have finished what you started.""  
  
""She... she'd be better off dead.""  
  
Tears streamed down my face. ""Adam... why? Why are you doing this?""  
  
Adam wouldn't even look at me. His voice was flat, emotionless.  
  
""You deserve everything coming to you.""  
  
Something inside me died in that moment.  
  
Adam—the same guy who'd found me crying in a campus bathroom three months ago after my mother had ""accidentally"" pushed me down the stairs—had abandoned me just like everyone else who'd seen that video.  
  
I remembered how he'd gently cleaned the blood from my face that day, promising to protect me no matter what.  
  
""Will you really never give up on me?"" I'd asked him, hardly daring to hope.  
  
He'd smiled that dimpled smile I loved so much.  
  
""Of course not. If your family treats you like nothing, then I'll just have to treat you a hundred times better to make up for it.""  
  
He'd promised to be my knight in shining armor.  
  
Instead, here he was, begging my mother to finish the job.  
  
As I lay there, drowning in despair, a question that had been nagging at the back of my mind suddenly pushed its way to the surface:  
  
What the hell was on that video that could make everyone—absolutely everyone—want me dead?

1kmciuc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Candida/comments/1kmciuc/oral_thrush_doesnt_always_mean_candida_overgrowth/,Oral Thrush doesn’t always mean Candida overgrowth in gut maybe?,"I’ve been doing lots of reading about oral thrush and candida in the last two weeks. I’m not saying I know it all or am even close to knowing everything there is to know about candida. From what i have read on google, websites, other subreddits and this subreddit specifically I have seen a lot of back and forth so I went back to google for some searching. 

In my search I looked up “does oral thrush mean overgrowth of candida in the gut?”. It says that oral thrush doesn’t always mean candida overgrowth in the gut and that it can just occur locally in the mouth. 

I had made another post a few days ago that pretty much went under the radar here about my overthinking and concerns about my symptoms (I know it’s different for everyone so pls don’t bash me for me speaking my thoughts) which were pale tongue, white coating on tongue, sores and white patches on tongue and gums. I’ve been on nystatin for almost two weeks and my symptoms are clearing up a good bit. 

Based off what I’ve read here and on google a lot of people with overgrowth in the gut have bloating, gas, constipation, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and nausea, brain fog, irritability, etc. I suffer from anxiety and depression from childhood trauma and also have PTSD so I will admit I can be irritable and sometimes have brain fog just based off of that, but all of the other symptoms I haven’t noticed. I’ve never had issues with oral thrush other than a few years ago when I had an allergic reaction to an antibiotic and it was a one time thing that was dealt with and didn’t return. 

I will say this time with oral thrush I’m unsure of what caused it but I do have some suspicions such as vitamin deficiency, stress, and wisdom tooth issues. As of today I started a multivitamin and will be working on getting more vitamin d as I’ve been known to have a deficiency in it. When I was first being medicated for anxiety and panic attacks my doctor had me taking a high dose vitamin d supplement once every two weeks because of my lack of sunlight among other things.

I’ve always had a sort of pale tongue which can be from many things including the vitamin deficiencies. I brush my tongue regularly and have always used mouthwash with alcohol (I’ve stopped and plan to use alcohol free mouthwash from here on out). I have struggled with eating habits but have managed to fix my diet somewhat over the last three years. I don’t drink soda except maybe every once in a while and even then I don’t finish them. I (like anyone else) enjoy my snacks and sweets when the craving is there but usually choose to eat plain Greek yogurt with honey, cinnamon, organic peanut butter and sometimes cocoa nibs. I avoid processed foods mostly other than when I make certain things my bf likes. My diet consists of eggs, beef, chicken, pork on occasion, many vegetables, pasta sometimes, rice, fruits (not many I enjoy to be fair), organic milk/almond milk, fish, and cheese. I do eat bread but not very often. 

The only fast foods I really eat are Taco Bell and pizza from Dominoes/little Caesar’s but have been cutting back on that. Sometimes I go get drinks from Dunkin but barely ever get the coffees because I prefer the refreshers with green tea. I only ever really drink water by itself or with lemon/limes, unsweet tea, olipop drinks, and herbal tea. 

With all this said, I feel like my overreading in this group has lead to an over analyzing of my oral thrush. The nystatin has worked for me along with salt rinses, using baking soda when I brush and rinse, and using turmeric as an anti-inflammatory. I had a couple set backs where I ate sugar that and things that upset my mouths biome, but for the most part the nystatin has worked. I’ve switched my toothbrush every time I’ve brushed and I’ve since avoided sweets and sugars. 

I plan to continue avoiding them until my symptoms have cleared and been gone for a week or two maybe longer depending. My mom has also ordered me Balance One Candassist as a safety net to make sure the oral thrush doesn’t return. I’ve also been getting advice from my aunt who also had oral thrush she struggled to get rid of. 

I’ve seen people talk about candida overgrowth being noticeable in their stool but haven’t noticed any changes in mine since this started or even before it did. 

With all this said, unless I am proven otherwise by experience, I do believe I simply have a stubborn case of oral thrush that just needs some time and patience to fully heal. I plan to follow the candida diet for the most part until my symptoms have been gone for a period of time, but I just find it hard to believe my oral thrush is because of a overgrowth in my gut. I’ve read that other people have had oral thrush without an overgrowth in the gut as well. 

Candida overgrowth in any form sucks and it being in the gut can absolutely be from an underlying cause and I sympathize with everyone that has suffered from it. 

Fingers crossed my oral thrush clears further without any setbacks, and thought and prayers out to everyone suffering. ",1,1747221314.0,Candida,0,1.0,False

1kmchk3,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1kmchk3/i_broke_into_the_wrong_house_now_people_in_town/,"I broke into the wrong house, now people in town are disappearing","The house sat alone at the edge of town, lit by golden windows and a tasteful porch lantern. It belonged to the Hawthornes. They were the kind of family people named buildings after. Wealthy. Well-liked. I actually used to be friends with one of their kids back during grade school.

Unfortunately, life for me didn’t go as swimmingly. And although I’d never broken into a home I’d once been invited to, jobs around Rynnville were fleeting, and I needed a bigger score than usual to carry me out of this town.

And it’s not my fault. No. The Hawthornes were the ones who basically killed Rynnville. They had stock in every business that started here — tech startups, green energy projects, even a damn syrup bottling plant. They were globally recognized before their stupid divorce and the disappearance of Mrs. Hawthorne shortly after.

It was easy to assume that was Mr. Hawthorne’s doing — but she was one of seventeen who went missing that month. Sixteen of them had no ties to the man at all. So he took his kids and left. Business followed him. And what little industry had taken root here dried up and blew away like everything else. The most stable job now is at the dollar store.

It’s a great, quiet place for hunting cabins. But those of us who live here? We have a 45-minute commute to stock shelves at Walmart.

So yeah — the Hawthornes can suck a fat one.

But you already know the upside: they hardly ever visit their old home. Maybe a few days every couple of months. And it’s only ever Mr. Hawthorne.

Outside of that, the house is patrolled by two security guards — which used to worry me. But it’s clear they’re not actually doing full sweeps. Just two lazy men with sidearms who get paid to lounge in a mansion and look intimidating. I mean, who would break into a house with security vehicles parked out front, right?

Well, when you watch the place for half a year, you notice things.

Seven out of eight security cameras have red lights. Three of those have ivy or spiderwebs obscuring their lenses. The same porch light’s been flickering since February. The back patio entrance? Basic pin tumbler lock. Child’s play.

But what caught my eye — what really *lingered* — were the windows.

The east side of the basement has two narrow rectangular windows, just above ground level. Not only are they locked, but nailed shut — thick, black iron nails sunk into the brick. 

And those same two windows? The room behind them only lit up twice in six months. Both times when Mr. Hawthorne was in town. The room containing the only thing valuable enough for the pompous billionaire prick to come back to town.

Two weeks ago, there were no lights. No guards awake. No Hawthornes. I’d made my decision.

I rounded through the woods in a wide arc to reach a small hole I’d cut into the fence months ago, hidden behind a few overgrown bushes. The grass was damp, but the air was still. I crept along the perimeter until I reached the blind spot of the one security camera without a red light, just in case it still had power.

From there, it was only a few careful shuffles to the left before I ducked under the patio. I knelt in the shadows and planted my Wi-Fi jammer, flicked it on, and tuned the frequency. It wouldn’t reach the cameras in front, but it would be enough to scramble the feeds and alerts tied to the three back exits I’d been casing for months, a tight escape net if things went wrong.

I chose the sliding glass patio door over the garage side entrance. Both were near staircases, but this one led toward the kitchen and living room, then the basement door beyond that. The garage entrance connected too closely to the bedrooms. I figured if the guards were still awake, they’d be planted on couches somewhere, nodding off to late-night TV. But the house was dark. Dead quiet. No action in the living room through the windows, so it was best to prioritize steering clear of the steps by the bedrooms.

The lock gave with barely a whisper. Thirty seconds, maybe less. I slipped inside, eased the door shut, and clicked the lock behind me.

The kitchen smelled like dust and stale coffee. My steps were slow, controlled, sliding forward on the balls of my feet. Every creak in the old wood floor felt too loud in the silence.

Past the marble island and the spotless stovetop, through the archway into the dining room — long table, high-backed chairs, no signs of life, and then I turned.

A narrow door just off to the side, tucked between built-in cabinetry. I opened it. The air that wafted up from below was cold and dry, with a strange coppery edge. I stepped through and shut the door behind me.

The stairs groaned more than I expected.

I froze. Waited. Counted to twenty. Nothing.

Then I descended.

 The basement smelled... different. Not like mildew or old laundry. It was sterile. Bleach. But strangely, it still looked the same as it had when I was a second grader coming over for birthday parties.

I’d stepped into the main entertainment space, two large rectangular rooms joined in an L-shape. Aside from the stairs behind me, if I followed the wall at my back to the left, I’d reach the hallway that led to the second staircase and a full bathroom.

The door I wanted, the one that led to the room with the nailed windows, sat dead center on the wall that ran alongside the hallway, only about twenty-five feet from where I stood. Close enough to the stairs. Close enough to my exit — the same way I came in.

Unfortunately, that meant it was in full view of anyone coming down from the other staircase.

If someone entered from that end, my only chance was to dive behind the big leather recliner in the far corner, where a cluster of fake plants and a side table offered some cover. I made a mental note of the escape route and the hiding spot, then crept toward the thick, dark oak door.

The lock was trickier than I expected. Forty-five seconds of quiet work before I got the pins to fall. “Bingo,” I muttered.

The door creaked as I eased it open. But I didn’t stop when it was wide enough to slip through. I pushed it farther than I needed to, maybe too far. Maybe that was my mistake. A better thief wouldn’t have hesitated.

Since that night, I haven’t opened a door all the way. Not even halfway. I don’t think I ever will again.

As the angle neared ninety degrees, something gritty scraped beneath the door, a faint drag, like grains of sand. Or salt.

Then I heard it.

Footsteps**.**

Bare feet, slapping against tile. Then softer. On carpet.

The second staircase. Someone was coming down.

I shut the door as gently as I could and sprinted on the balls of my feet, ducking behind the recliner and crouching low behind the fake ferns and dusty side table.

And I held my breath.

A burly man flicked on the stairwell light. He muttered over his shoulder to someone I couldn’t see — clearly the other guard.

“It was probably nothing, man. The dust triggers this shit all the time. Just check the kitchen.”

A laser system. 

You’ve got to be fucking kidding me.

I didn’t understand why it was necessary yet. But I would. Very soon.

The man trudged down the hall, thankfully too lazy or groggy to flip on any more lights. The only one lit was the stairwell, casting his silhouette deep into the room. His shadow reached the floor just a few feet from my hiding spot. Then he stopped.

He was barefoot and wearing sleep attire, the only thing that marked him as a guard was the sidearm at his waist. He scrunched his toes in the carpet and bent down, brow furrowed, picking something up.

A speck.A grain.

“The barrier,” he muttered. The words barely made it out, half-gasped, half-whispered.

My gut twisted.  
  


He was about to figure it out.., that someone had disturbed whatever the hell that gritty stuff was.

Salt. Sand. Rice maybe.

He straightened slowly, put his ear to the door, left hand on the knob. His right unclipped the holster at his hip.

*You fucking idiot.* I blamed myself.

I forgot to relock the door, and it was going to raise all of his alarms.

My self-loathing swelled even as the rational part of me reasoned that there hadn’t been time to lock it.But it didn’t matter. He’d know.He’d open it and I’d be—

**CRASH**

The center of the oak door exploded inward, a shriek of splintered wood and ragged force.

Two long, bone-thin arms burst through — grey with decay, slick with sinew, mottled with sores that wept pus and rot. Fingers like snapped branches lashed out, tipped with yellowed nails crusted in dirt and old blood.

The guard didn’t scream. His breath caught in his throat.

The thing’s knuckled hands clamped around his waist — not his chest, not his legs — his waist, like it meant to fold him in half.

Then it did.

A sickening snap echoed through the room as his spine bent backward. He didn’t even cry out.

His eyes locked with mine across the room — wide, horrified, searching for something. For help. He was sputtering out blood, gawing.

The arms continued to pull.

It yanked him by his ruined waist into the splintered hole, forcing him through like a toddler jamming the square block into the round hole of a toy.

The jagged wood peeled him as he went — his face dragging against splinters, his ankles twitching and twisting beneath his head, desperate to follow the rest of him through. Then a wet thud as he hit the floor on the other side.

Silence.

Then the door creaked open.

And *it* stepped out.

Shambling. Tall. Hunched**.**

Its limbs were too long, not inhuman in design, but wrong in proportion. Its spine pushed against the skin of its back like something trying to emerge. The hair on its scalp hung in greasy, stringy mats — the kind that looked like it would all come off in one slick wipe.

Then I saw its face.

Or what was left of it.

A slack, dangling jaw crowded with teeth, some animal, some jagged, and some familiar. Human.

But what hit me hardest wasn’t the teeth.

It was the bracelet.

Delicate silver links with a small amber stone — the kind a kid remembers because it looks like something no one else’s mom ever wore. Paired with a ring I hadn’t seen since I was eight.

A massive diamond, the most expensive thing I’d ever laid eyes on back then.

Mrs. Hawthorne.

Scanning the room, the *Hawthorne-thing* nearly locked eyes with me.

Her gaze drifted, slow and dragging, pupils wide and black, swallowing what should have been her irises. Those empty eyes crept closer to my hiding spot, like she could feel me. Sense me. Could she smell the piss running down my leg?

Then… A yelp. From the stairs. The other guard.

Her head snapped toward the sound with a twitch so fast it barely registered — less like turning and more like a glitch.

He was gone around the corner, running. I heard him throw down stools in the kitchen to cover his escape.

Then she was off.

She bolted for the stairs, slamming into the walls as she went. The sound of her sprint — no, something faster than — rattled the floorboards.

Inconceivably fast.

Then came the tearing.., wet, violent. A splash of glass shattering. And finally:

The alarm.

I gave it a minute.

The police station was in the center of town, and I wasn’t about to be the next body bag just because I didn’t want to bump into the cops.

When I finally moved, I tightened the strings on my hoodie and sprinted out the front door. No way in hell was I cutting through the woods — not with Mrs. Hawthorne somewhere out there.

Four minutes later, lungs burning, I heard the sirens. As they rounded the corner, I dove into a ditch and held my breath while the cruisers roared past.

By the time I made it back to my car, parked behind the old bottling factory, I spotted police units from the next town over tearing through the main road.

The house burned down by the end of the week.

I don’t know what the police know. But they’re not telling the town the truth.

Two young girls went missing that Thursday. Last time they were spotted was the swing set behind the elementary school. On Saturday, they found an abandoned car out by Observatory Park, near the edge of town. Blood on the dash. Signs of a struggle.

There’s still a few people who haven’t officially been reported missing, but their families are posting, asking if anyone has heard from them recently.

During one of the search parties, a sheriff never came back. Just didn’t return.

And in the last seven days, judging by Facebook posts, eleven pets have vanished. Dogs. Cats. Even a parrot, someone said.

I want to leave. Every instinct I have is screaming at me to run.

But they’ve issued a stay-at-home order.

So now I’m stuck here.

What the fuck do I do?

1kmch4s,https://www.reddit.com/r/pakfragaddicts/comments/1kmch4s/reviewing_al_rehab_attars/,Reviewing Al- Rehab Attars,"I recently got into perfumery and went down the rabbit hole of Arabic perfumes. I love how affordable they are but I don’t like splurging too much on something I can’t smell right away so I was looking for something cheap. 
I got 3 Al Rehab attars, each for 430 rupees per. Here is my review on each of them:

1. French Coffee: I despise this. If I wasn’t a wasteful person I would’ve thrown it away. It definitely gives coffee but it’s like Kopiko with a tonne of syrup and then becomes bitter. It very much gives coffee but if this was a literal coffee served somewhere, I would’ve avoided it. It has the least longevity, thankfully.

2. Choco Musk: this is probably the one raved about the most. It smells chocolatey, vanilla, its very gourmand. Its not extraordinary or something I would smell and think, “Oh wow, I need to have it.” But combining the price value and plus I do like gourmand, I might buy it again. However, to some people its like cheap sugar water which I sort of understand. Its longevity is moderate. I keep it in my in my gym bag.

3. White Musk: its this gentle clean scent, your average feminine white musk. Nothing spectacular but I like this so far since I like the concept of layering. And among the 3 of them, this has the most longevity.


Has anyone else tried anything from Al Rehab?

It belonged to the Hawthornes. They were the kind of family people named buildings after. Wealthy. Well-liked. I actually used to be friends with one of their kids back during grade school.

Unfortunately, life for me didn’t go as swimmingly. And although I’d never broken into a home I’d once been invited to, jobs around Rynnville were fleeting, and I needed a bigger score than usual to carry me out of this town.

And it’s not my fault. No. The Hawthornes were the ones who basically killed Rynnville. They had stock in every business that started here — tech startups, green energy projects, even a damn syrup bottling plant. They were globally recognized before their stupid divorce and the disappearance of Mrs. Hawthorne shortly after.

It was easy to assume that was Mr. Hawthorne’s doing — but she was one of seventeen who went missing that month. Sixteen of them had no ties to the man at all. So he took his kids and left. Business followed him. And what little industry had taken root here dried up and blew away like everything else. The most stable job now is at the dollar store.

It’s a great, quiet place for hunting cabins. But those of us who live here? We have a 45-minute commute to stock shelves at Walmart.

So yeah — the Hawthornes can suck a fat one.

But you already know the upside: they hardly ever visit their old home. Maybe a few days every couple of months. And it’s only ever Mr. Hawthorne.

Outside of that, the house is patrolled by two security guards — which used to worry me. But it’s clear they’re not actually doing full sweeps. Just two lazy men with sidearms who get paid to lounge in a mansion and look intimidating. I mean, who would break into a house with security vehicles parked out front, right?

Well, when you watch the place for half a year, you notice things.

Seven out of eight security cameras have red lights. Three of those have ivy or spiderwebs obscuring their lenses. The same porch light’s been flickering since February. The back patio entrance? Basic pin tumbler lock. Child’s play.

But what caught my eye — what really *lingered* — were the windows.

The east side of the basement has two narrow rectangular windows, just above ground level. Not only are they locked, but nailed shut — thick, black iron nails sunk into the brick. 

And those same two windows? The room behind them only lit up twice in six months. Both times when Mr. Hawthorne was in town. The room containing the only thing valuable enough for the pompous billionaire prick to come back to town.

Two weeks ago, there were no lights. No guards awake. No Hawthornes. I’d made my decision.

I rounded through the woods in a wide arc to reach a small hole I’d cut into the fence months ago, hidden behind a few overgrown bushes. The grass was damp, but the air was still. I crept along the perimeter until I reached the blind spot of the one security camera without a red light, just in case it still had power.

From there, it was only a few careful shuffles to the left before I ducked under the patio. I knelt in the shadows and planted my Wi-Fi jammer, flicked it on, and tuned the frequency. It wouldn’t reach the cameras in front, but it would be enough to scramble the feeds and alerts tied to the three back exits I’d been casing for months, a tight escape net if things went wrong.

I chose the sliding glass patio door over the garage side entrance. Both were near staircases, but this one led toward the kitchen and living room, then the basement door beyond that. The garage entrance connected too closely to the bedrooms. I figured if the guards were still awake, they’d be planted on couches somewhere, nodding off to late-night TV. But the house was dark. Dead quiet. No action in the living room through the windows, so it was best to prioritize steering clear of the steps by the bedrooms.

The lock gave with barely a whisper. Thirty seconds, maybe less. I slipped inside, eased the door shut, and clicked the lock behind me.

The kitchen smelled like dust and stale coffee. My steps were slow, controlled, sliding forward on the balls of my feet. Every creak in the old wood floor felt too loud in the silence.

Past the marble island and the spotless stovetop, through the archway into the dining room — long table, high-backed chairs, no signs of life, and then I turned.

A narrow door just off to the side, tucked between built-in cabinetry. I opened it. The air that wafted up from below was cold and dry, with a strange coppery edge. I stepped through and shut the door behind me.

The stairs groaned more than I expected.

I froze. Waited. Counted to twenty. Nothing.

Then I descended.

 The basement smelled... different. Not like mildew or old laundry. It was sterile. Bleach. But strangely, it still looked the same as it had when I was a second grader coming over for birthday parties.

I’d stepped into the main entertainment space, two large rectangular rooms joined in an L-shape. Aside from the stairs behind me, if I followed the wall at my back to the left, I’d reach the hallway that led to the second staircase and a full bathroom.

The door I wanted, the one that led to the room with the nailed windows, sat dead center on the wall that ran alongside the hallway, only about twenty-five feet from where I stood. Close enough to the stairs. Close enough to my exit — the same way I came in.

Unfortunately, that meant it was in full view of anyone coming down from the other staircase.

If someone entered from that end, my only chance was to dive behind the big leather recliner in the far corner, where a cluster of fake plants and a side table offered some cover. I made a mental note of the escape route and the hiding spot, then crept toward the thick, dark oak door.

The lock was trickier than I expected. Forty-five seconds of quiet work before I got the pins to fall. “Bingo,” I muttered.

The door creaked as I eased it open. But I didn’t stop when it was wide enough to slip through. I pushed it farther than I needed to, maybe too far. Maybe that was my mistake. A better thief wouldn’t have hesitated.

Since that night, I haven’t opened a door all the way. Not even halfway. I don’t think I ever will again.

As the angle neared ninety degrees, something gritty scraped beneath the door, a faint drag, like grains of sand. Or salt.

Then I heard it.

Footsteps**.**

Bare feet, slapping against tile. Then softer. On carpet.

The second staircase. Someone was coming down.

I shut the door as gently as I could and sprinted on the balls of my feet, ducking behind the recliner and crouching low behind the fake ferns and dusty side table.

And I held my breath.

A burly man flicked on the stairwell light. He muttered over his shoulder to someone I couldn’t see — clearly the other guard.

“It was probably nothing, man. The dust triggers this shit all the time. Just check the kitchen.”

A laser system. 

You’ve got to be fucking kidding me.

I didn’t understand why it was necessary yet. But I would. Very soon.

The man trudged down the hall, thankfully too lazy or groggy to flip on any more lights. The only one lit was the stairwell, casting his silhouette deep into the room. His shadow reached the floor just a few feet from my hiding spot. Then he stopped.

He was barefoot and wearing sleep attire, the only thing that marked him as a guard was the sidearm at his waist. He scrunched his toes in the carpet and bent down, brow furrowed, picking something up.

A speck.A grain.

“The barrier,” he muttered. The words barely made it out, half-gasped, half-whispered.

My gut twisted.  
  


He was about to figure it out.., that someone had disturbed whatever the hell that gritty stuff was.

Salt. Sand. Rice maybe.

He straightened slowly, put his ear to the door, left hand on the knob. His right unclipped the holster at his hip.

*You fucking idiot.* I blamed myself.

I forgot to relock the door, and it was going to raise all of his alarms.

My self-loathing swelled even as the rational part of me reasoned that there hadn’t been time to lock it.But it didn’t matter. He’d know.He’d open it and I’d be—

**CRASH**

The center of the oak door exploded inward, a shriek of splintered wood and ragged force.

Two long, bone-thin arms burst through — grey with decay, slick with sinew, mottled with sores that wept pus and rot. Fingers like snapped branches lashed out, tipped with yellowed nails crusted in dirt and old blood.

The guard didn’t scream. His breath caught in his throat.

The thing’s knuckled hands clamped around his waist — not his chest, not his legs — his waist, like it meant to fold him in half.

Then it did.

A sickening snap echoed through the room as his spine bent backward. He didn’t even cry out.

His eyes locked with mine across the room — wide, horrified, searching for something. For help. He was sputtering out blood, gawing.

The arms continued to pull.

It yanked him by his ruined waist into the splintered hole, forcing him through like a toddler jamming the square block into the round hole of a toy.

The jagged wood peeled him as he went — his face dragging against splinters, his ankles twitching and twisting beneath his head, desperate to follow the rest of him through. Then a wet thud as he hit the floor on the other side.

Silence.

Then the door creaked open.

And *it* stepped out.

Shambling. Tall. Hunched**.**

Its limbs were too long, not inhuman in design, but wrong in proportion. Its spine pushed against the skin of its back like something trying to emerge. The hair on its scalp hung in greasy, stringy mats — the kind that looked like it would all come off in one slick wipe.

Then I saw its face.

Or what was left of it.

A slack, dangling jaw crowded with teeth, some animal, some jagged, and some familiar. Human.

But what hit me hardest wasn’t the teeth.

It was the bracelet.

Delicate silver links with a small amber stone — the kind a kid remembers because it looks like something no one else’s mom ever wore. Paired with a ring I hadn’t seen since I was eight.

A massive diamond, the most expensive thing I’d ever laid eyes on back then.

Mrs. Hawthorne.

Scanning the room, the *Hawthorne-thing* nearly locked eyes with me.

Her gaze drifted, slow and dragging, pupils wide and black, swallowing what should have been her irises. Those empty eyes crept closer to my hiding spot, like she could feel me. Sense me. Could she smell the piss running down my leg?

Then… A yelp. From the stairs. The other guard.

Her head snapped toward the sound with a twitch so fast it barely registered — less like turning and more like a glitch.

He was gone around the corner, running. I heard him throw down stools in the kitchen to cover his escape.

Then she was off.

She bolted for the stairs, slamming into the walls as she went. The sound of her sprint — no, something faster than — rattled the floorboards.

Inconceivably fast.

Then came the tearing.., wet, violent. A splash of glass shattering. And finally:

The alarm.

I gave it a minute.

The police station was in the center of town, and I wasn’t about to be the next body bag just because I didn’t want to bump into the cops.

When I finally moved, I tightened the strings on my hoodie and sprinted out the front door. No way in hell was I cutting through the woods — not with Mrs. Hawthorne somewhere out there.

Four minutes later, lungs burning, I heard the sirens. As they rounded the corner, I dove into a ditch and held my breath while the cruisers roared past.

By the time I made it back to my car, parked behind the old bottling factory, I spotted police units from the next town over tearing through the main road.

The house burned down by the end of the week.

I don’t know what the police know. But they’re not telling the town the truth.

Two young girls went missing that Thursday. Last time they were spotted was the swing set behind the elementary school. On Saturday, they found an abandoned car out by Observatory Park, near the edge of town. Blood on the dash. Signs of a struggle.

There’s still a few people who haven’t officially been reported missing, but their families are posting, asking if anyone has heard from them recently.

During one of the search parties, a sheriff never came back. Just didn’t return.

And in the last seven days, judging by Facebook posts, eleven pets have vanished. Dogs. Cats. Even a parrot, someone said.

I want to leave. Every instinct I have is screaming at me to run.

But they’ve issued a stay-at-home order.

So now I’m stuck here.

What the fuck do I do?

A burly man flicked on the stairwell light. He muttered over his shoulder to someone I couldn’t see — clearly the other guard.

“It was probably nothing, man. The dust triggers this shit all the time. Just check the kitchen.”

A laser system. 

You’ve got to be fucking kidding me.

I didn’t understand why it was necessary yet. But I would. Very soon.

The man trudged down the hall, thankfully too lazy or groggy to flip on any more lights. The only one lit was the stairwell, casting his silhouette deep into the room. His shadow reached the floor just a few feet from my hiding spot. Then he stopped.

He was barefoot and wearing sleep attire, the only thing that marked him as a guard was the sidearm at his waist. He scrunched his toes in the carpet and bent down, brow furrowed, picking something up.

A speck.A grain.

“The barrier,” he muttered. The words barely made it out, half-gasped, half-whispered.

My gut twisted.  
  


He was about to figure it out.., that someone had disturbed whatever the hell that gritty stuff was.

Salt. Sand. Rice maybe.

He straightened slowly, put his ear to the door, left hand on the knob. His right unclipped the holster at his hip.

*You fucking idiot.* I blamed myself.

I forgot to relock the door, and it was going to raise all of his alarms.

My self-loathing swelled even as the rational part of me reasoned that there hadn’t been time to lock it.But it didn’t matter. He’d know.He’d open it and I’d be—

**CRASH**

The center of the oak door exploded inward, a shriek of splintered wood and ragged force.

Two long, bone-thin arms burst through — grey with decay, slick with sinew, mottled with sores that wept pus and rot. Fingers like snapped branches lashed out, tipped with yellowed nails crusted in dirt and old blood.

The guard didn’t scream. His breath caught in his throat.

The thing’s knuckled hands clamped around his waist — not his chest, not his legs — his waist, like it meant to fold him in half.

Then it did.

A sickening snap echoed through the room as his spine bent backward. He didn’t even cry out.

His eyes locked with mine across the room — wide, horrified, searching for something. For help. He was sputtering out blood, gawing.

The arms continued to pull.

It yanked him by his ruined waist into the splintered hole, forcing him through like a toddler jamming the square block into the round hole of a toy.

The jagged wood peeled him as he went — his face dragging against splinters, his ankles twitching and twisting beneath his head, desperate to follow the rest of him through. Then a wet thud as he hit the floor on the other side.

Silence.

Then the door creaked open.

And *it* stepped out.

Shambling. Tall. Hunched**.**

Its limbs were too long, not inhuman in design, but wrong in proportion. Its spine pushed against the skin of its back like something trying to emerge. The hair on its scalp hung in greasy, stringy mats — the kind that looked like it would all come off in one slick wipe.

Then I saw its face.

Or what was left of it.

A slack, dangling jaw crowded with teeth, some animal, some jagged, and some familiar. Human.

But what hit me hardest wasn’t the teeth.

It was the bracelet.

Delicate silver links with a small amber stone — the kind a kid remembers because it looks like something no one else’s mom ever wore. Paired with a ring I hadn’t seen since I was eight.

A massive diamond, the most expensive thing I’d ever laid eyes on back then.

Mrs. Hawthorne.

Scanning the room, the *Hawthorne-thing* nearly locked eyes with me.

Her gaze drifted, slow and dragging, pupils wide and black, swallowing what should have been her irises. Those empty eyes crept closer to my hiding spot, like she could feel me. Sense me. Could she smell the piss running down my leg?

Then… A yelp. From the stairs. The other guard.

Her head snapped toward the sound with a twitch so fast it barely registered — less like turning and more like a glitch.

He was gone around the corner, running. I heard him throw down stools in the kitchen to cover his escape.

Then she was off.

She bolted for the stairs, slamming into the walls as she went. The sound of her sprint — no, something faster than — rattled the floorboards.

Inconceivably fast.

Then came the tearing.., wet, violent. A splash of glass shattering. And finally:

The alarm.

I gave it a minute.

The police station was in the center of town, and I wasn’t about to be the next body bag just because I didn’t want to bump into the cops.

When I finally moved, I tightened the strings on my hoodie and sprinted out the front door. No way in hell was I cutting through the woods — not with Mrs. Hawthorne somewhere out there.

Four minutes later, lungs burning, I heard the sirens. As they rounded the corner, I dove into a ditch and held my breath while the cruisers roared past.

By the time I made it back to my car, parked behind the old bottling factory, I spotted police units from the next town over tearing through the main road.

The house burned down by the end of the week.

I don’t know what the police know. But they’re not telling the town the truth.

Two young girls went missing that Thursday. Last time they were spotted was the swing set behind the elementary school. On Saturday, they found an abandoned car out by Observatory Park, near the edge of town. Blood on the dash. Signs of a struggle.

There’s still a few people who haven’t officially been reported missing, but their families are posting, asking if anyone has heard from them recently.

During one of the search parties, a sheriff never came back. Just didn’t return.

And in the last seven days, judging by Facebook posts, eleven pets have vanished. Dogs. Cats. Even a parrot, someone said.

I want to leave. Every instinct I have is screaming at me to run.

But they’ve issued a stay-at-home order.

So now I’m stuck here.

What the fuck do I do?

1kmcfiu,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_NileshKasurde/comments/1kmcfiu/neurologistapproved_habits_for_a_healthier_brain/,Neurologist-Approved Habits for a Healthier Brain,"Keeping your brain healthy is just as important as caring for your body. With the rise of stress, busy lifestyles, and screen overload, our mental fitness often takes a backseat. But what if you could make a few small changes every day that boost your brain power? According to more than one experienced neurologist, a few key habits can make a big difference in how your brain functions, ages, and stays sharp.

Let’s dive into some simple, science-backed, and neurologist-recommended tips that you can start using right away.

# 1. Prioritise Quality Sleep

A good night’s sleep isn’t just for rest—it’s fuel for your brain. While you sleep, your brain clears out toxins, stores new information, and resets for the next day. Most neurologist professionals recommend 7–9 hours of uninterrupted sleep each night for adults.

Sleep also helps with memory, mood, and problem-solving. If you find it hard to sleep, try setting a regular bedtime, turning off screens an hour before sleep, and keeping your room dark and cool.

# 2. Keep Your Brain Active

Your brain is like a muscle—the more you use it, the stronger it gets. A [**neurologist**](https://healthcitycaymanislands.com/neurosciences/) will often suggest brain-challenging activities like puzzles, learning a new language, playing an instrument, or reading something outside your comfort zone.

Even small things like changing your daily routine, trying new foods, or taking a different route to work can keep your brain flexible and sharp. Mental stimulation slows cognitive decline and supports long-term brain health.

# 3. Get Moving Daily

Physical activity isn’t just great for your heart; it’s also fantastic for your brain. Studies supported by the neurologist community show that regular exercise improves blood flow to the brain, enhances mood, and helps with focus and memory.

You don’t need to hit the gym for hours—a daily walk, yoga session, or even dancing in your room can help. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate activity most days of the week to keep your brain and body in sync.

# 4. Eat for Brain Health

What you eat plays a huge role in how your brain functions. A balanced diet that includes healthy fats, whole grains, leafy greens, nuts, seeds, and berries is often recommended by a neurologist as brain-friendly.

Try to avoid heavily processed foods, sugary snacks, and too much caffeine or alcohol. Drink plenty of water to stay hydrated, as even mild dehydration can affect focus and memory.

# 5. Manage Stress Before It Manages You

Stress is a major brain disruptor. It can shrink brain size, reduce memory, and affect mood regulation. A neurologist will usually emphasise the importance of managing stress through deep breathing, mindfulness, or relaxation techniques.

Try journaling, spending time in nature, or practising gratitude. Even five minutes a day of quiet time can go a long way in calming your nervous system and protecting your mental well-being.

# 6. Stay Socially Connected

Human connection is food for the brain. Whether it’s a quick call with a friend, a chat over coffee, or a group hobby, social interaction stimulates brain activity and lowers the risk of cognitive decline.

A neurologist may suggest keeping in regular contact with loved ones and joining community activities or clubs to stay mentally engaged. Loneliness can hurt the brain, so don’t underestimate the power of a good conversation.

# 7. Avoid Smoking and Excessive Drinking

Most neurologist specialists agree—smoking and too much alcohol are harmful to brain health. These habits can increase the risk of stroke, memory loss, and neurological disorders over time.

Making a conscious choice to reduce or quit these habits will not only benefit your brain but also improve your overall quality of life. Small changes, like cutting down slowly or finding healthy replacements, can go a long way.

# 8. Protect Your Head

This may seem simple, but it’s often overlooked. Always wear a helmet when riding bikes, skateboarding, or engaging in any activity where falls can happen. A neurologist will always stress the importance of head safety to prevent injuries that could have long-term effects on brain health.

Even a mild concussion can impact your cognitive function, so take precautions and never ignore head injuries, no matter how minor they seem.

# 9. Get Regular Checkups

Your brain may not always give you clear signals when something’s off. That’s why regular health checkups are important. A visit to a neurologist can help catch early signs of neurological conditions and guide you on steps to prevent further issues.

If you experience frequent headaches, memory loss, confusion, or balance problems, don’t wait. A timely consultation can make all the difference.

# 10. Practice Gratitude and Positivity

Finally, being positive isn’t just good for your mood—it’s great for your brain. According to many neurologists**’** recommendations, daily gratitude practices and focusing on the positive can reduce stress and improve brain performance.

Try writing down three things you’re grateful for each day. It trains your brain to focus on the good and helps rewire negative thought patterns.

Your brain is your most valuable tool—why not give it the care it deserves? By following these simple, neurologist-approved habits, you can enjoy better focus, memory, and mental strength throughout life.

1kmcf9a,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/1kmcf9a/the_ashenfang_lineage_ecological_fantasy_5139/,The Ashenfang Lineage [Ecological Fantasy; 5139 Words],"Just curious the response this will receive here. I kind of figured out how I write what I consider to be quality content: Don't say anything about something until the last possible moment. Story begins below.

Ever keen to the eye, a flower was picked, and a flower did die. To the Ashenfang lineage, such was life, and the cycle continued. Erideth, hair black as night, eyes greener than the emerald sea. She walked a path her forebears paved with blood and bone. Wood kissed her palm like an old lover in silence, her most trusted companion. The quiver on her back was filled with Death's promises; each arrow a prayer spoken in hushed tones to the gods who never answered.

Born of the dawn in winter, into the cold twilight she emerged. And in the winter cold, with arms outstretched, she realized the gift she had been given. Her life was not to bask in the warmth, but to weather the storm. To Erideth, the cold chill was but her kin, a sibling. Frost clung to her lashes, but blood was fire in her veins. She did not shiver, for she was a flame.

The village nearest her home was still a day's journey away. Through the icy woods and over frozen plains, Erideth moved like a creature of myths, each footfall pressing secrets into snow. Elders spoke her name in hushed conversation, lest the mere utterance summon her like a wraith from between worlds.

Such was the power of an Ashenfang; feared, even in absence. Not for cruelty, nor wrath alone, but the certainty they carried, freezing marrow in bone. Death would come for her, as does us all, but it would not find her kneeling, nor begging, nor lost. With the weight of a thousand lives behind her, she'd greet Death as one greets a long lost love; no fear, no sorrow, only the quiet understanding of things long foretold. But today, she lives, walking amongst the ancient pines of her ancestors.

A fox, almost out of youth, hungered for its next meal. Ears a funnel for sound, it’d listen quite intently, listening for mice beneath the surface of the snow. Hopping from the hind legs, landing muzzle first. Its snout broke through the snow, but found no writhing rodent to eat. Hunting took dedication, something Erideth knew all too well. A few steps more, a hop from the hind legs but still, no success. Time and time again, until eventually, the fox returned to the surface, crimson staining its maw.

Erideth stilled her breath, one with the silence of the winter woods. She watched the fox with quiet reverence from her perch atop a snow covered boulder. Its russet coat blazed brightly against the white landscape like a burning ember, defiant against the cold that sought to extinguish all warmth. The creature was young but it wasn't naive. Its movements deliberate, stained with the urgency of survival. As teeth began to tear into flesh, Erideth saw the hunger that drove it. Not desperate, not reckless, but calculated.

Ears swivel, scanning for the next meal. Another few steps and the fox pounced again. Nothing. And again. Once more and this time success; a field mouse dangling limp. Erideth caught her lips curling into the ghost of a smile. Admiration colored her mind; not an apex predator, but a predator nonetheless. The fox stood still, ears turning its head toward her. She'd been spotted. Amber eyes locked with hers and instinct wrestled with curiosity, its body tense and its hackles risen. A lift of the head, curiosity getting the best of the young fox. Cautiously, slowly, a step forward. Then another. Erideth didn't move, didn't speak. Pause, ears tilted forward. Understanding, hunter to huntress, then he took off into the trees.

Snow-laden pines gave way to fence posts, capped in a layer of fresh powder. A sign, partially painted in winter’s embrace, bore the village name in faded letters. Boots broke the blanket of snow, the crunch of ice beneath her heels announcing her presence. Morgenstern was a scatter of low-slung cottages huddled together in the biting wind, smoke curling from chimneys. The air smelled of woodsmoke as villagers, bundled in thick furs, hobbled to and fro.

At the village center was a firepit, large enough to host a bonfire around which some villagers gathered. An opportunity to warm her feet and hands, an opportunity she took. Night was soon upon the village, and the air grew colder than just the daylight chill. Reluctantly, she'd leave the glow of the bonfire, the radiant heat quickly leaving her body. A few streets more, the Howling Wolf called her name. The snow crunching beneath her feet, she trudged onward.

A wooden sign swung gently above the door, an intricately carved wolf with its head tilted skyward. The wood was cracking, weathered by many seasons of sunshine, summer heat and snow. As she came to the steps before the tavern, she could hear voices coming from inside. Climbing the steps, knocking her feet free of snow, she entered and pulled out a seat at the bar. The air inside a nice reprieve from the cold, she ordered a warm drink, coffee with a shot of whiskey. From across the bar, an old friend called her name.

“As I live and breathe, Erideth Ashenfang. What brings you out of hibernation?” A voice laced with amusement, he turned to face her.

“Kaï, long time, no see.” A constant in a world defined by solitude.

“Quite the expedition from your cave, you must be looking for something?”

“These are things we can discuss later. Right now I’m here to relax, rest my weary mind from the journey behind me.”

Erideth had enough silver with her to last a few days before beginning the trek back home. The Howling Wolf still had vacant rooms to spare, and for the days coming, this would be her base of operations.

“I take it then you'll be staying at least a day? It’d be good to catch up with an old friend.”

“A day or two,” she trailed off…

“Well, it's nice to see you nonetheless.”

Erideth finished the last few lukewarm sips of her coffee, the whisky having long since faded into a pleasant warmth.

“A room for the night, if you could so please.”

“Room seven is available. That'll be a coin for the drink, two for the room.”

She slid four coins across the bar, one extra as a tip. Grabbing the key, she gave Kaï a nod, slid the strap of her pack onto her shoulder and made her way through the common room toward the stairs.

The room was small but neat; a place to leave her belongings, a bed and a desk. She pulled from her pack a leather bound journal, its pages filled with her spidery script. The leather, softened with age and use. Countless observations scrawled across the paper; places where deer congregate during night, where the ice was thin on the river, the migratory patterns of certain birds. She settled into the chair at her desk and began writing.

“The woods held their breath, a stillness that spoke of the deep cold in winter; the crunch of snow under foot the only break from the silence, save for the sighing wind through the treetops. The fox…”

Her quill hovering above the page, she gave thought to the creature. Young, but already showing signs of a seasoned hunter; skills honed by necessity. A male, judging by the size, age by the still-bright sheen of its coat.

“...its ears, constantly swiveling and twitching, caught the sound of rodents beneath the surface of the snow. Many attempts yielded nothing; the world hidden under a blanket of bluish white.”

She spoke of what she hunted for food on the journey to Morgenstern, the meat she left in the icebox at the cabins. She concluded the journal entry, stripped of her outerwear and pulled the blanket over her body.

[Dream Sequence?]

The world outside her window was painted in the hues of dawn, the deep blue and purple a nice contrast to the brilliant, almost blinding white of the previous day. The morning brought with it a subtle warmth; breath less immediately became condensate. She pulled out a seat at the bar, retrieved her journal and ordered a coffee.

“The call of the eagles can only be heard less and less, migratory patterns are shifting. There's been a decrease in vocalizations as compared to this time last year. The rodents prayed upon by the foxes are just the same as those by the eagles, the owls, the bobcats.”

The door to the tavern swung open and with it came Kaï. She continued writing.

“Habitats are changing; the undergrowth of the western woodlands is thinning, resulting in less cover for rodents, for grouse.”

Kaï pulled a seat at the bar, “the whispering pines still sharing their secrets with you?”

“Sometimes I wonder if it's a simple whisper... or more an inaudible scream,” the warmth from the coffee warming her chilled fingers. She fixed her eyes on Kaï while retaining that distant gaze, her mind still populated by thoughts of the world around them.

She looked back to her coffee, “the call of migratory birds can be heard less and less. Habitats are changing, the cycle of life and death unbalanced.”

These woods are her kin and she tends to them as such. A steward of the natural order, this kinship does not come without burden, nor this burden without brotherhood. Willowbark, she needed to see him, to verify her observations. An elder of the village, the wise bard reciting poetry and telling stories of victory, of defeat, of life and death.

The road to Aldrics cottage wound beyond the village edge, where the forest crept closer and the pines loomed tall against the gray sky. A cottage nestled against the trees, a sight reminiscent of her youth. Aldric mentored the young Ashenfang, was a part of her family, like an uncle to her. The sound of an axe; a rhythmic thud punctuated by the crack of wood splitting. Smoke curled from the chimney as the fire kept the home warm. He gathered some of the split wood as Erideth carried the rest inside.

“The forest spoke of your coming. I wish circumstances were different, but welcome.”

“I know you sense it, too. Something's wrong, you speak the dialect of the woodlands better than I.”

“Forces are at war, these forests their battle grounds. The cervids, the sciurids disappearing, and predators abandoning once prime hunting grounds.” Aldric set another log on the fire, embers spitting and crackling into the hearth.

“This much I’m aware of...”

“But you don't know why, do you?”

“No, I come here hoping you might.”

“I wish there was an easy answer, but that's something I can't give. The springs are drying earlier in the year, sometimes before the snowpack has melted. Herbivores that rely on the river are leaving or starving, entire ecosystems are collapsing,” Aldric’s voice was grave, carrying with it the weight of urgency.

“I saw a fox hunting mice.. it was a successful hunt, but…” she paused, reflecting on the encounter. Was it successful, if you consider the fox, its appetite? “It was hungry, not totally desperate, but enough to be apparent.”

“This valley is going through a gradual transformation,” Aldrics voice held a chill about it that made Erideth shiver, “and although I’m not typically one to argue with ecology, the death of an ecosystem means the death of the villages that rely on it.”

Aldric moved to the chest before his bed, extracting from it a tattered journal, its binding beginning to crack after years.. decades of use.

“I’ve only seen two of these cycles, but Moira documented three before me,” Aldric opened the journal, gently turning the pages until he found a certain entry.

She thought back to her grandmother. Moira died while Erideth was still quite young, leaving little to her memory but the stories told of her. It was told that she kept birds of prey, that her spirit was now flying amongst them.

“3rd of March, 1482 - The final few snowfalls of the season are upon us and the bravest of songbirds have returned. The river has thawed and the bears are descending from the mountains, hungry for food. The trees are still barren, the forest floor devoid of life. Winter has not yet fully released its grip, and I fear it will hold tight longer than we expect. I hope the bears have the strength to wait, and if not, may they find the will.""

At the time of these entries, Moira was but 27. As with most every Ashenfang, her stewardship started in youth, before even she turned 16. Her specialty? Birds; she envied the freedom they had, the territory they could survey. She befriended corvids, she kept owls and she spoke with raptors; eagles and hawks.

""6th of April, 1482 - The snow has stopped falling, the rivers are rushing and life seems to be making a return. The bears feeding on vegetation; on berries, on grasses and roots. For the wildcats, this is the end of gestation, the time for new life to make an entrance. But, as with every action, an act must oppose. Stomachs growl as these kittens grow, and the mother must hunt. A deer? Likely not, but some try, fewer still succeed. A bunny? Only if she's desperate will she expend the energy needed to catch one, for they hardly provide sustenance above what's wasted in the chase. A field mouse is easy pickings, but many are needed, and not enough are around for this to be the only source of food.""

Aldric paused, lifting his head for a glance at Erideth. ""What she's describing here, this is life as you've known it thus far. Rather, life as you've been aware.""

""Right, and in context, you're saying that this cyclical, that this has happened before and will happen again? Why need we worry then?""

""We need worry because this village has grown to almost unsustainable levels, levels that use fully the resources available. We are reliant on the land, on the wildlife we so cherish, and the food that they provide to those who work for it. This could be the work it takes to hunt, the work it takes to run and operate a tavern, the craftsmanship of a blacksmith, all these people need sustenance, and sustenance these forests provide.""

""And what do you expect we do to fix this? We can't force Mother Nature to provide for us; life is all but a competition, a challenge of who can survive the longest. Death in rebirth, if it's inevitable, don't fear it.""

""Erideth, not everyone has the capacity to think like this.""

""Just because they can't choose to accept reality, just because they're scared?""

""And this is why people fear you, that people have long feared the Ashenfang.""

""To be feared is to be built up as a deity in the minds of those who fear us.""

""Perhaps, but not a god, nor goddess, eats. If you were truly a goddess, you wouldn't bleed, nor would you die. The villagers all know, you are still mortal, and the only way a mortal can live is to eat."" Aldric wasn't so cold as her, yet somehow, in this instance, he was more rational.

""Sounds like a problem of overpopulation, a problem that is to be handled naturally.""

Aldric furrowed his brow, ""Moira was nowhere near as cold as you.""

Erideth laughed, ""And Moira I barely knew.""

""You may not be carrying her memory yourself, but we carry it for you. Our ideas are not purely our own, we carry with us the legacy of those who carried the memories of our past. This complacent attitude hurts Moira's memory, her legacy and her will.""

""And what did Moira do at the outset of one of these cycles? Mother Nature isn't one to lose, and I'm not typically one to fight a losing battle.""

""Moira did her part, and I'm doing mine. We are stewards of the land, and whether you choose to acknowledge it or not, you will feel the effects of this change just as we will in Morgenstern."" Aldric grew indignant as she put up protest to his request.

""I'm not adverse to a little challenge in life, I document life living through adversity.""

""And do you intend to document the starvation of this village, the death of people reliant on an ecosystem that you are too complacent to save? Or worse yet, do you intend to ignore them entirely?""

""I didn't intend on helping, and I didn't intend on being a hero.""

""Yeah, and I didn't intend to ask.""

""Then what would you have me do, o' wise bard?"" Sarcasm dripped from her tongue like poison, a venomous smile curled on her lips.

""Find the root of the issue and address it, that's all we can do.""

""The river will be rushing as the snowpack melts, and soon the salmon will be swimming upstream. If, as you have made clear, the ecosystem does experience a collapse, it won't yet for a number of months still.""

""And in the meantime, we can't grow complacent. How long is your stay in Morgenstern?""

""I figured two days including our own, enough to corroborate my findings, then begin the journey back to my cave.""

""You may find two days isn't enough, I will speak with the elders about what next need happen.""

""Very well.""

With that, Erideth left his cabin, her boots breaking through the surface of the snow, her steps leaving tracks in the pristine white. Her breath came out in thick plumes, clouds of steam forming in the frigid air.

She returned to the tavern, the sun beginning to set in the distance. The clear skies of day give way to a tumultuous dusk, a storm formulates overhead as she enters the tavern. Kaï, had he been waiting here all this day?

""How did it go with the whispering pines?"" He asked, a voice laced with almost a sort of annoyance, but one with a sense of understanding, given of her occupation.

""He didn't seem too thrilled with the state of things, but there's nothing I can do. This is a natural part of life, and we will serve what comes naturally.""

""You've got the luxury of being so disconnected, a cave to hole up in and avoid the hardships of the world around you.""

""You say that as if I was a hibernating bear. I don't eat moss to plug my asshole so I can survive the winter. No, I work harder in the winter months, and a lone person is not at the top of the food chain when in these woods. Just as a lone wolf is alone, has not the ability to chase prey over great distance without a pack to exchange who takes the lead, I do not have my tribe with me at all times. I do not have the luxury of relaxation, nor indifference, in the winter.""

""And what do you expect summer to bring?""

""From the sounds of it, food will be hard to come by after the coming months, perhaps even years. I will work to save myself, just as we all should.""

""Your individualism curses you to be blind, you may be more independent than I, but you still must return to Morgenstern every so often. You are still reliant on the collective, albeit less so than most."" Kaï simply told her the truth, but the truth not always she chose to listen to.

""It's a curse to live as I do? Then I must be one cursed fuck, cause I have no interest in changing."" Erideth's annoyance grew apparent.

""Maybe so, maybe it is a curse to live as you do, but a blessing for others. I will speak with those I know can make a difference in our community, we will make an effort to conserve the food we have. If this cycle is anything like the ones Aldric has spoken of, we will not have enough food, even just later in this year.""

""You'll find your efforts will only serve as a crutch, an excuse not to adapt. The only way we survive is by being the apex, the top of the food chain, the dominant species. If you can't eat what is around you, you will become the eaten.""

""And what will you do?"" Kaï asked the question with genuine interest.

""I will adapt, as I have always done. Are you asking my choice?""

""Is that too much to ask?""

""No, but it's fresh on my mind, I don't have an answer yet.""

She finished her coffee, placed a couple coins on the bar and walked to the stairs, legs carrying a mind at race to the floor above. She heard what Aldric was saying, the plea from Kaï, the challenge from Mother Nature. She knew that the coming days would bring a change in plans, that life in the coming months would be easy as compared to what comes afterwards. She retrieved her journal and began writing.

""The river remains restless for now, but soon it will dry. The flora reliant on it will die, and the fauna will starve. The cervids, majestic creatures, they will be forced to leave, and the bears and wolves will follow. We are beginning to witness a recession in the ecosystem we are reliant on. There is no easy answer, there is no simple solution. There is a balance to nature, and a balance to the food chain.""

The quill rested between her fingers; the feather of a raven, black and glossy. The ink still wet, she left her journal open, allowing it to dry fully before returning it to her pack. She sat down at her bed and began stripping of her clothes. Her hands, chilled and rough with calluses, were the first to feel the warmth of the fireplace. Her arms, her torso, her legs; all warming in the gentle heat. She slipped under the blankets, pulling them tight against her body, the weight of her eyelids growing heavy as sleep overtook her.

[Dream Sequence?]

As she woke from a deep slumber, the world outside the window was painted in the hues of dawn, the blue sky fading into the brilliant yellows and reds. She felt a familiar ache in her chest, one that made her feel weak, like she couldn't breathe. It was as though her heart was breaking, shattering, the fragments slicing through her insides.

This is life behind defense mechanisms formed out of necessity. She couldn't remember the last time she felt love other than platonic, let alone reciprocated it. This was the price paid for her occupation, her lifestyle. She pulled her clothes on and a few moments later, she was dressed and ready. Today was to be her last in Morgenstern, but she had yet to meet with the village elders. 

The morning brought a chill, but nothing as severe as the previous. The clouds overhead were gray, yet the day was bright, the sun's rays casting long shadows in the snow. She descended the stairs into the common room, had not enough gold for another night, but enough for breakfast.

She took a seat at the bar, her eyes following the movement of a barmaid; her blonde hair tied into a braid, a smile spread across her lips, one that could make even the coldest of hearts melt.

""What can I get you today?"" Her voice; smooth, melodic, chipper as a bird.

""Breakfast, whatever the day's special is, and a coffee.""

""I'll have that right out, and for a mug of coffee, that'll be a copper.""

Erideth slid a coin across the counter. ""Thank you.""

She gave the girl a smile, not too wide, and certainly not warm, but not completely disingenuous either.

The girl returned the smile, a warmth and authenticity about it. She returned shortly, the coffee and food in hand.

""If you need anything else, don't hesitate to ask.""

""Thank you. I'll let you know if I do.""

With that, the girl disappeared, attending to other patrons in the tavern.

Erideth finished her breakfast, left a silver piece on the counter and began to pull on her winter wear. The day was young yet, but she had much to do.

She pulled her hood over her head, and with this act, she stepped outside. The wind whistled between the buildings, a sound eerie and lonely. She made her way along the main street, a snow covered path lined by log buildings and wooded lots. Her boots left prints in the pristine white snow, and the sun cast a shadow ahead of her.

Walking down the street toward the bonfire, she began to think of what she might say. She knew that Aldric would talk to the village elders, but he wouldn't volunteer her without consent, something she made clear she wasn't giving. She paused at the bonfire, catching the warmth before continuing onward. 

Her mind was racing, still unsure of what she wanted going forward; whether or not she'd help the village survive. Ahead of her was the village hall, a building that housed the elders of the village and, should they see fit, a council meeting. This was where Aldric had asked she come.

She could hear their voices inside, at least four in total. One, a woman's voice, carried itself as one who knew what was at stake, another sounded tired, perhaps worn down or sick, she couldn't tell. The third spoke with a raspy, harsh tone. Erideth had a presence about her, even the most respected of elders quieted with her entrance before the conversation continued.

""We must find what is causing the springs to dry so early; farmers rely on that water to feed our people. We need someone, or a group of people, to head upstream of the river until no river remains, then to follow even further until we find what it is causing our problems.""

The councilmen looked up from the map on the table before them as Erideth looked down upon it. The river snaked up through the mountains, the valley's headwater a mystery to all but the mountains who breed it. The water flows south before it twists back through the mountains as the headwaters emerge in the spring thaw. The map detailed a rough idea of what these mountains look like, but she couldn't find the specific mountain pass where the headwaters might be, where they likely were.

""Aldric tells me you're a stewardess of ecology, the Ashenfang that observes, writes and documents what the natural world tells us, but tell me this, do you have a name?"" The first voice to address Erideth belonged to an elderly woman, her long hair had turned a snow white, and the skin that was once youthful, now wrinkled with time and age. Her blue eyes were cold and icy, and her posture that of someone with little strength.

""I'm an Ashenfang, what more need you know?"" Her response, cold and short, was that of someone whose reputation preceded her, in response to a stranger who knew more about her than she knew of herself.

""We are no longer a superstitious bunch in Morgenstern, though I suspect this is news to you."" Her tone was flat, that of a mother, stern but loving. ""It is a pleasure to have you join our conversation. I am Emira, and just as you, I'm a stewardess of this land.""

""I'd be curious your maiden name, as I know you know mine.""

""I was born a woman to no family other than my own, my maiden name is still as it is currently. I'm an Oldsworth.""

""So you have relation to Kaï then? I'd hope he'd be able to join me on this journey.""

""I’m his godmother, I’ve known him since he was yet to be born. I don't expect you to work alone. No, that would be too difficult an ask."" Emira paused to cough, clearing her throat, ""The cold does me no favors this time of year. Kaï will not go with you, not without the unanimous blessing of the council, but should we decide to send him, you can expect a compliment of two more than yourself that are capable of survival in the wilderness.""

""I can not guarantee they survive, the environment up there is harsh and unforgiving. I will do my best to ensure their return, but I do not work well in a group, especially when they do not work well together.""

""Then we will make an effort to have them do so, your expedition may very well determine the fate of our village.”

""From everything I've heard, everything I've seen and taken note of, this seems to be the case. Let me know when you've made a decision. I'm going to rest my mind, I've had much to think about, and I have much yet with which to do the same.""

Gathering her things, she walked to the stairs with intent of climbing before another voice, raspy and hoarse, called out to her.

""If I were your age and in your position, I wouldn't want to help, either. It is, after all, human nature to look out for only those you know. For most, it's hard to remember mortality at your age. To see people age and pass is one thing, to know you yourself will follow in time is something else entirely. I don't doubt the Ashenfang's knowledge or expertise in these matters, but it's easy to ignore what you've learned and believe what you want when it's something you want to believe.""

""And what is it you think I want to believe?"" Erideth hated when people put words in her mouth, her voice short and curt in response.

""That you can only help those willing to help themselves, that we are choosing not to help ourselves."" Thalion's voice carried a worry that clearly was new to his mind. ""We only petition you for help because we know not how to help ourselves.""

Thalion was the youngest at the table of elders, but he was still an elder to her. The worry in his voice was evident, if a little bit dramatic.

He continued, saying ""we are a village of a capable people, but this challenge lies outside our abilities.""

""You've rarely ever even left Morgenstern, have you? You wouldn't have just said that, life beyond the village limit is nothing hard.""

""And here you think that the residents of this village are all just as capable as you?""

""We're both human, why would another be less than able to match me?""

""Because we aren't members of the Ashenfang,"" Aldric was more than annoyed with her resistance, ""our lives aren't defined by how cold our hearts are.""

What should I do?,"This is as weird as it sounds. I (26M) have been dating my girlfriend “Lena” (25F) for over a year. Things have been mostly great—she’s kind, smart, supportive, and my family loves her. Especially my dad (52M), which I thought was cute at first.

Two nights ago, Lena left her phone unlocked while she was in the shower. I wasn’t snooping—I swear—I just picked it up to move it off the couch so I could sit down. A text popped up. It was from *my dad*.

The message read:  
**“Same time tomorrow?”**

I opened the thread. I know I shouldn’t have, but my stomach dropped. It wasn’t romantic or sexual, but it was… *strange*. They’ve been texting *almost daily*. Jokes, venting, inside jokes I’ve never heard before. Apparently they’ve been *meeting up* regularly—just the two of them. Coffee shops, long walks, even dinner once or twice.

I confronted Lena, and she said it’s nothing shady. She just really “connects” with my dad and thinks he’s “easy to talk to.” She said she didn’t tell me because she thought I’d “overreact.”

Now I feel completely thrown. Why would *my dad* keep this from me? Why would *she*? I’m not saying they’re having an affair, but something about this feels… off. Too close. Too personal. And no one told me.

I haven’t brought it up to my dad yet. Lena is acting like I’m being paranoid. But I can’t shake this feeling that something’s wrong.

1kmcda6,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1kmcda6/we_dropped_everything_and_started_again_heres/,We dropped everything and started again — here’s what changed,"Exactly 13 months into developing our first game, we scrapped it.

It was a 4-player horror game set in a haunted hotel. You’d start in the basement and work your way up, capturing paranormal footage and trying to survive. Think low-poly *Lethal Company* meets *Phasmophobia*, with a vertical map.

The problem? We built it backwards.

We put all our time into the map and characters before locking in the gameplay. So we kept shifting the design, chasing fun that never quite landed. It led to constant scope creep and eventually burnout.

Still, it was a massive learning experience. We figured out how to make quality assets and found our groove working as a team. But at the end of those 13 months, we were staring down another year of work just to *maybe* reach early access — and we weren’t even sure it’d be good.

So we ditched it.

We sat down in a coffee shop and made the call: no more over-scoped ideas. From now on, if it doesn’t work in its most basic form, we’re not building it. A lot of devs (us included) treat scope like people treat car budgets — they forget to factor in the maintenance.

We took a simple concept — a card game we played over Christmas — and twisted it: 4 players, each with a saw in front of them. Lose a round, the saw gets closer. That became *The Barnhouse Killer*.

This time, we focused entirely on the gameplay loop first. No map design, no UI, no distractions. Once that was solid, we started layering — one barn, one map, detailed and atmospheric, built by just the two of us. No bloat, no filler.

We kept scope under control, which meant we had time to do things right: proper menus, UI, animation polish, actual dialogue. Things that usually get cut or rushed.

Unlike our first attempt, this time we’re able to launch a Steam page, learn how to use Steamworks, grow wishlists, and steadily build a Discord community — all while still actively developing the game. Keeping the scope tight is what makes this possible. We're not drowning in unfinished features, so we actually have time to focus on the backend and marketing, which are just as critical as the game itself.

Now we’re a month or two from release. It’s a small game, but it’s polished, and it feels good. We didn’t work harder — we worked smarter.

My husband is 57 and desperately wants to lose weight. He is dedicated and does not cheat. He eats what I make. I feel like I am doing something wrong. He drinks black coffee and minimum 4 bottles of water a day. Last night I made a tri-tip for dinner. It was seared in lard before putting in the oven, added about 3T butter at the end. I also made carnivore mayo which was very solid cause I made it with eggs, lard, and bacon grease so I thinned it out with water and used it as a dipping sauce. We ate till full. This morning he had a good size hamburger patty with cheese (block) and 4 fried eggs. Lunch will be the leftover tri-tip, I estimate 3/4 of a pound.  This is a typical day, but he is gaining. He works in a refinery so it’s a pretty even mix of sitting and being active outside. We live very on a farm so there is always something to do when he comes home.

Nag sisimula palang daw sila sa brand nila pero may 3 branch na sila. Na tangap agad ako and tinuro agad ang basic measurements para sa coffee, milk tea, and lemonade nila tapos binigyan ako ng isang free na milktea. Saka ko na nainom yung milktea pag uwi ko at sinuka ko lang agad akala ko dahil buntis lang ako kaya ko sinuka kaya hindi ko na masyado inisip. 

Kinabukasan habang gumagawa ako ng drinks napansin ko na ang dumi ng stall nila. Yung lagayan ng sauce may itim itim sa gilid gilid. Yung gripo at lababo may soap scum lalo na sa part kung saan lalabas yung tubig sa gripo at galing gripo yung tubig na ginagamit para sa lemonades. Yung tea nila pwede pa daw umabot ng ilang araw pag di naubos agad tikmam ko lang daw yung ok pa yung lasa saka ko lang i tapon pag talagang masama na ang lasa kung hindi pa malala dagdagan ko nalang ang ibang ihahalo para di halata. Yung coffee ganoon din tangalin ko lang daw yung mantika pag nag mantika na tapos i halo ko sa bagong coffee kasi sayang. Yung plastic cups na naiwan ng customer kinukuha tapos hinuhugasan lang kasi sayang daw mahal ang bili nila sa cups. Pag may nag reklamo daw na iba lasa ng milktea sabihin ko lang daw na baka hindi sila sanay na totoong tea ang milk ang ginagamit at sa powder na timpla lang sila nasanay kaya para sakanila pangit ang lasa. 

Ayoko nang bumalik para mag trabaho don nakakatakot baka ma reklamo sila madamay pa ako.

That was easier then angle or horizon mode 💪😍👍

A big thank you to all who commented on the post above. My acro fear changed into the urge to lift off in Acro. 

We had some windy days but this morning was better with low wind speeds and almost no gusts.

Gladd to have set my alarm way to early. After the useual coffee and shower ritual it was time for a short visit to a field near my home.

No fear, no nothing. Just the urge to experience the Acro.

I had only time for one pack. And if I had any goals it was to see how the control would be.

I uploaded the few minutes of flying around, slowing down and trying a circle in Acro. Nothing spectacular but my first acro.

Conclusion:
So glad I posted about my Acro fear and asked for help. Today I experienced that flying was easier than ever before due to full control.

A big thank you to all who spent some time and commented on my previous post.

1kmca12,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1kmca12/he_broke_something_in_me_that_i_dont_know_how_to/,He broke something in me that I don’t know how to fix,"I don’t even know how to explain the kind of heartbreak I’m feeling. It's physically, mentally, and emotionally draining. I feel weak, tired, and sick. I can feel it in my chest and in my stomach. It's like a constant ache that never fully goes away—just shifts around. Some days it’s sharp, other days it’s dull, but it’s always there. Sleep doesn’t fix it. Food doesn’t help. Even when I laugh or distract myself, there’s this quiet heaviness underneath it all.

I gave everything I had to make us work....my energy, my happiness, my confidence, my charm —and now I’m the one left empty. He gets to move on, make someone else happy, live his life like nothing happened. And I’m just here, stuck, watching from a distance, wondering how to even function and why I wasn't good enough.

Feeling like you’re not enough or not worthy of someone’s love is one of the most painful things. I lay awake at night just to cry when no one can hear me. I scroll through old photos I know I shouldn’t look at. I replay old conversations, trying to find the moment where it all went wrong, but it was never rught to begin with. He faked his way into my life and lead me to believe i deserved all the happiness in the world, and he came into mine only to destroy every punce of happiness ive ever know.

The long drives to work are miserable. I had to give up being a stay-at-home mom, and now I drop our baby off at daycare while she reaches for me, crying my name. I can’t even listen to the radio anymore — the sound of her cries still echo in my head, and music only makes it worse. Every song somehow becomes about him. Even the upbeat ones. My brain twists the lyrics into memories, and I just sit in silence, because anything else feels unbearable.

People around me have noticed. They say I’ve lost my spark. The loud, wild, bubbly personality I used to have is gone. My coworkers—who knew me from working there years ago—barely recognize me anymore. I fake smiles and small talk just to get through the day. No one sees how hollow I feel. I spend my breaks crying in my car, when I used to walk around and chat with everyone.
It’s exhausting, pretending to be okay. Faking a version of myself just to survive.

All I ever wanted was for him to make me feel important. To treat me like I mattered. To be loved, wanted, and taken care of — not hated. Not belittled and abused. Not wanted only when it was convenient. Not left struggling while he distracts himself with someone new, spending money on weekend getaways instead of diapers for his daughter.

And maybe the part that hurts the most is realizing how foolish I was to think he still cared. I waited around hoping for signs — something to prove I still meant anything to him. Then came Mother’s Day. I told myself, “This will tell me everything I need to know.” I waited all day — for a card, a small Amazon package, a door-dashed coffee, sunflowers at my doorstep... something. Anything.

And nothing came.

Even with all the pain between us, even going through the hardest thing life can throw at two people, I still thought that if he’d really changed, he’d show it. That he’d take one moment to acknowledge what I’ve done, what I’ve endured, what I’m still carrying — and who I am to our child.
But he didn’t.

He knows I’m hurting. He knows what I’m going through, and he’s heard the pain in my voice — but it doesn’t faze him. He treats me like I’m the enemy, when he’s the one who single-handedly destroyed our family.
The truth is, we were two different people who wanted different things. I just didn’t want to see it. I believed love would be enough. I believed I was enough. And now I’m the one left trying to piece myself back together — wondering how I even got here, and when I’ll ever feel whole again.

He broke something in me that I don’t know how to fix. And maybe he’ll never understand what it’s like to give someone every piece of your soul… only for them to treat it like it was disposable. Like you were disposable. And the worst part is — he’ll probably never feel sorry for it. He’ll just keep living like I was never the one who would’ve done anything for him.

From expensive whitening kits to sensitivity toothpastes, fluoride rinses, and even mouthwashes that claimed to “restore enamel.” Some helped a little, most did nothing. And then out of nowhere, I saw someone mention *Larineco gum reddit* and thought... gum? For cavities and sensitivity?

I wasn’t convinced, but I was curious. So I gave it a shot. What happened honestly surprised me - and I’m not easily impressed by wellness trends.

# It actually supports enamel repair

Larineco chewing gum is made with **Nano Hydroxyapatite**, which I learned is the same mineral that makes up your enamel. When you chew it, these tiny particles bond with your teeth and fill in weak or damaged spots.

I started chewing it after meals, especially after coffee, and within about a week, the sensitivity in my molars started to fade. I wasn’t expecting that. It was a slow, steady improvement - not like some overnight fix - but it felt real.

# Whitening that doesn’t hurt

Here’s the deal: I love coffee. And red wine. So naturally, my teeth take a hit over time. I’ve tried whitening strips before, but they always made my teeth ache afterward. Larineco doesn’t use peroxide, so it’s not chemically bleaching anything. Instead, it smooths out the enamel and lifts stains gradually by repairing the surface.

After a few weeks, I noticed my teeth just looked better. Not “blinding white” but cleaner, brighter, and more even in color. It looked like the kind of whitening that comes from *healthy* teeth.

# More than breath freshening

Bad breath used to sneak up on me by late afternoon, especially on dry workdays or after eating certain meals. Larineco gum ingredients like **Mastic** and **Xylitol** don’t just cover it up - they target bacteria that actually cause the smell.

Since starting, my mouth has felt fresher for longer, and I don’t constantly reach for mints anymore. Also, it helps with dry mouth, which I didn’t expect but really appreciate.

**This is where I ordered it**:  
[**Larineco Official Offer Page**](https://getlarineco.com/offer-01/?lpid=1056&source_id=DL&utm_source=8928&utm_medium=&utm_term=1056&aff_id=8928&sub_id=&req_id=&oid=1056&device_type=&country_name=&oid=1056&affid=8928&source_id=Rddt)

# What makes it different

Here’s what stood out to me:

* It’s fluoride-free (which I prefer)
* Uses birch-derived Xylitol, which is more natural than the corn-based kind
* Safe for kids, no chemicals, and it’s made in a clean, FDA-registered facility

I chewed 2–3 pieces a day, usually after meals, and made it part of my routine. It fits easily into my life and doesn’t feel like a chore - plus it tastes good and leaves your mouth feeling genuinely clean.

**This helped me learn more before buying**:  
[**Why people are switching to Larineco gum**](https://getlarineco.com/reasons-why/?lpid=2529&source_id=DL&utm_source=8928&utm_medium=&utm_term=1056&aff_id=8928&sub_id=&req_id=&oid=1056&device_type=&country_name=&uid=2529&oid=1056&affid=8928&source_id=Rddt)

# Final thoughts

If you’re like me and deal with weak enamel, mild pain when brushing, or you’re tired of surface stains making your smile look dull - Larineco might actually help. It’s simple, it’s backed by solid ingredients, and it does more than any gum I’ve ever chewed.

For anyone searching through **larineco gum reviews** or wondering if a **larineco remineralizing gum review** could finally point you to something that works - I’d say give it a try and see what happens.

The night before their third wedding anniversary, Cary Gibson emerged victorious from a high-end auction, securing a pair of rare sapphire earrings.  
  
He said softly, ""This is for the person I owe the most--my beloved.""  
  
From home, his wife, Evelina Marsh, felt tears pooling as she watched the auction on television. Tomorrow was their third anniversary, and maybe, at long last, Cary had realized her devotion.  
  
Cary's grandmother, Demi Gibson, exhaled in quiet satisfaction. ""At long last, Cary's learned how valuable his wife truly is.""  
  
The next evening, Evelina had barely set the finishing touches on an extravagant dinner when Cary stepped through the door.  
  
She hurried to greet him, swiftly taking his briefcase before reaching out for his coat.  
  
""Quite a feast tonight,"" he said lightly. ""Did something happen?""  
  
Tall and captivating, Cary carried himself effortlessly. Even the simple act of loosening his tie appeared like a polished gesture from a high-fashion shoot.  
  
Yet, somehow, he always managed to chill Evelina with just a few words. Her fingers paused uncertainly, and she quietly said, ""You didn't forget, did you?""  
  
No, that couldn't be right. He had purchased those priceless sapphire earrings to make amends, hadn't he?  
  
Cary's eyebrows knitted together slightly. ""Forget what exactly, Evelina?""  
  
""The sapphire earrings... you bought them, didn't you?"" Her heart trembled with unease, but hope stubbornly remained.  
  
""How do you know about those earrings?"" Cary appeared genuinely startled. He clearly didn't expect his mild-mannered, invisible wife to keep tabs on such extravagant things.  
  
A faint smirk tugged at his lips, hinting at contempt.  
  
Certainly, Evelina possessed natural beauty--gentle features, eyes soft and expressive--but she refused to flaunt it. She dressed plainly, appearing perpetually dull and overlooked, like a flower that had ceased to bloom.  
  
Even the Gibson household maid seemed more refined than Evelina.  
  
Yet, Evelina gathered her courage, eyes shining cautiously. ""I saw the auction broadcast. Those earrings are really lovely--""  
  
Cary interjected her abruptly, ""They're for Esme.""  
  
At the mere mention of his first love, Esme Barton, Cary's voice softened noticeably. ""She's finally agreed to return to me. Naturally, I needed something special to welcome her back.""  
  
Evelina felt her chest tighten painfully, her breath hitching.  
  
So, the one he felt indebted to was Esme Barton, the very woman who had abandoned him?  
  
And what did that make her--the devoted wife who had stood beside him for three years without complaint, never even asking for recognition?  
  
Unable to bear it, Evelina's voice wavered with hurt. ""Cary, have you forgotten whose fault the accident was--the one that blinded you?""  
  
On that terrible day, Esme had thrown a tantrum over something insignificant, distracting Cary and causing him to crash.  
  
When news broke that Cary's sight was likely permanently lost, Esme swiftly disappeared, crafting a flimsy excuse before fleeing overseas the same day. She left no trace, vanishing completely.  
  
Their wedding had already been announced, invitations sent. Neither Esme nor her family could be located.  
  
If Evelina hadn't courageously stepped in at the final hour, the Gibson family would've been the scandalous gossip of the whole city.  
  
""You know nothing about it!"" Cary retorted harshly. ""Esme wasn't to blame!""  
  
He refused to tolerate any criticism directed at his so-called true love. ""Esme arranged the surgeries for my eyes,"" he replied defensively. ""If someone hadn't accidentally revealed the truth, I would never have known everything she secretly did for me.""  
  
Stunned, Evelina could barely form words. ""What... are you saying?""  
  
It was Evelina herself who performed his surgeries. His grandmother had practically begged her for help. She had conducted three critical procedures, pushing herself to exhaustion. Countless sleepless nights she spent tending to him, never revealing she was the renowned Sight Weaver, devoting herself entirely to Cary.  
  
How had Esme ended up with all the credit?  
  
""Are you certain? You trust every rumor you hear?""  
  
""Absolutely. Esme was Professor Landen Mitchell's last apprentice--the only person on Earth qualified to perform those surgeries,"" Cary responded with unwavering pride and gratitude.  
  
But wasn't Evelina actually Professor Mitchell's final apprentice? How long had Esme been pretending to be her?  
  
Evelina desperately wanted to expose Esme's deception right then and there, but she quickly recalled her mentor's death six months earlier.  
  
Of course, Esme would choose now to make her return.  
  
With Landen gone, no one could challenge Esme's claims. And Cary, fully healed through Evelina's care, now held significant influence as head of the Gibson Group. Esme's timing was impeccably strategic.  
  
Evelina had no evidence, no way to reveal the truth. Quietly, bitterly, she asked, ""Then what are you even doing here tonight? Shouldn't you be celebrating with Esme?""  
  
Removing her apron abruptly, Evelina felt despair gnawing painfully at her heart.  
  
Cary's answer was casual and indifferent. ""I'm exhausted, Evelina. Let's end this marriage. We agreed on three years, and I've endured it long enough.""  
  
Endured it long enough? How dare he casually dismiss all her sacrifices?  
  
Three long years she'd sacrificed, pouring everything she had into nursing him back from blindness, making him the powerful man he had become.  
  
Without even acknowledging the anguish on her face, Cary calmly took out a set of divorce documents, obviously prepared ahead of time. ""Review them. If you have no objections, sign. I've wasted enough time already. I won't make Esme wait anymore.""  
  
Glancing over the papers, Evelina focused bitterly on the divorce settlement--an apartment far from the city center, the worn-out car she'd driven for groceries, and a mere three million dollars.  
  
Incredible. His audacity was astonishing.  
  
He'd gifted sapphire earrings worth three hundred million to the woman responsible for his blindness, yet offered a paltry three million to the wife who had saved him.  
  
Three million wouldn't even cover the cost of one of her surgeries, let alone make up for the countless procedures she had rejected during these three years spent hidden away, caring only for him.  
  
""If you want more..."" Cary anticipated tears or pleading from Evelina.  
  
Instead, she scoffed softly, picked up the pen decisively, and signed her name with determination.  
  
Cary faltered, bewildered. He hadn't expected her to surrender so quickly. Evelina was an orphan--would she really walk away from a life of comfort?  
  
Handing back the signed papers, Evelina said coldly and clearly, ""It's done. But Cary, you'd better not regret your choice.""  
  
  
Chapter 2 The Queen Returns  
Momentarily startled, Cary recovered quickly. ""Of course I won't regret this. But since you accepted the settlement, it's your responsibility to explain the divorce to Grandma.""  
  
Cary knew perfectly well that Demi only recognized Evelina as her true granddaughter-in-law. If news of their divorce reached her ears, he'd face her wrath.  
  
And naturally, Cary expected Evelina to shoulder the blame.  
  
Without raising her gaze, Evelina calmly replied, ""I'm not explaining anything to her. In these past three years, I've settled my debt with Demi in full. Aren't you madly in love with Esme? What's wrong--can't even muster enough courage to face your own grandmother?""  
  
Growing up in an orphanage, Evelina owed her education entirely to Demi's generosity.  
  
So when the Gibson family urgently needed a substitute bride, she'd readily stepped in.  
  
She didn't flinch when Cary lost his vision. Instead, she fulfilled her duties faithfully, cared tirelessly for him, and managed the household without complaint.  
  
She had one modest request--a three-year trial. If Cary failed to fall in love with her by the end, they'd peacefully part ways.  
  
Now, finally, her freedom had arrived.  
  
""True love conquers everything,"" Evelina replied dryly, sarcasm lightly coating her words. ""I genuinely hope your perfect fairytale lasts forever.""  
  
Reaching for her car keys, she found her path abruptly blocked by Margot Gibson, Cary's younger sister.  
  
""Evelina, I heard you're divorcing my brother. That car is Gibson family property--you can't take it!""  
  
Evelina laughed coldly. ""I paid for this car myself. Honestly, Margot, you're just as brazen as Cary.""  
  
Drawn by the commotion, Cary stepped forward. ""What's happening here?""  
  
Immediately, Margot complained petulantly, saying, ""Cary, Evelina is taking the car, and I was planning to use it!""  
  
His brow creased slightly. ""Evelina, hand over the keys to Margot.""  
  
""Absolutely not,"" she replied coldly. ""Why should I?""  
  
""You're unbelievable!"" Margot lunged forward to grab the keys.  
  
Suddenly, an old suitcase flew into the vehicle, followed swiftly by several lit firecrackers.  
  
In moments, sparks flew and thick smoke billowed as the firecrackers erupted, sending Margot shrieking in panic.  
  
""The car is yours--I don't want it,"" Evelina responded coolly, brushing off her hands as she turned decisively away.  
  
Everything she'd used or worn in the Gibson household would remain. She wanted nothing to remind her of this place.  
  
She quickly dialed her closest friend, Kristina Anderson.  
  
As Evelina reached the villa gates, a sleek, understated luxury car awaited her.  
  
Kristina's jaw dropped dramatically. ""Well, if it isn't the real Queen Evelina herself!""  
  
Feigning astonishment, Kristina rubbed her eyes. ""Three years, Evelina. Every call I've made, you were too preoccupied tending to that ungrateful husband. I honestly couldn't tell whether I'd attended your wedding or your funeral back then.""  
  
Leaping forward, Kristina embraced Evelina tightly. ""Finally done with that 'blind' fool? Good. Now we start living for real.""  
  
Kristina snapped her fingers theatrically. ""Wait, no--I need to stock up on fireworks! Your grand return demands a proper celebration.""  
  
""You're too late,"" Evelina said coolly, gesturing casually over her shoulder.  
  
Just then, an explosive bang split the peaceful night. The old car erupted spectacularly into flames.  
  
Sparks scattered brilliantly, lighting up the darkness in a vivid display.  
  
""How's that for a farewell gift?"" Evelina asked with a playful grin, her eyebrow arched mischievously.  
  
Kristina erupted into laughter. ""There she is! Queen Evelina is finally back! Time to party!""  
  
Sliding into the passenger seat, Evelina gave an exhausted sigh. ""Another day, perhaps. I just desperately need sleep.""  
  
She had spent the last three years caring tirelessly for Cary's recovery, barely managing to rest properly. Fatigue weighed heavily on her now.  
  
Inside the villa, Margot was stamping her foot furiously.  
  
""She nearly scared me to death! Has Evelina lost her mind? She destroyed our car! Cary, you have to do something about her--""  
  
""That's enough!"" Cary interrupted sharply.  
  
Exasperation lined his voice as he scolded, ""Is this childish tantrum how a Gibson should behave?""  
  
Margot quickly shifted to a pleading, wounded tone, saying, ""Are you actually scolding me over that woman? Wait until I tell Esme--she'll see how much you've changed!""  
  
""Don't talk nonsense,"" Cary retorted irritably, though privately dismissing Evelina as insignificant compared to his sister.  
  
He quickly softened his voice to reassure her. ""Have you forgotten Jasper Russell is arriving in Aglonard soon?""  
  
The Russell family, among Ireah's most influential families, dominated politics, business, and military circles, making them untouchably powerful.  
  
And Jasper Russell, their youngest heir, wasn't only extraordinarily charismatic but also managed the immense Russell Group. His slightest gesture sent ripples across high society.  
  
Most importantly, he was the only bachelor among the Russell heirs. Every wealthy young woman in Aglonard and beyond fantasized about becoming Mrs. Russell.  
  
""I haven't forgotten,"" Margot murmured shyly, blushing deeply at the mention of her admired figure.  
  
She clung affectionately to Cary's arm, adding eagerly, ""He's visiting for his niece's eye treatment. If Esme successfully heals Miss Florrie Russell's eyesight, she'll become indispensable to the Russell family--and undeniably valuable to us. Even Grandma will have to accept her then.""  
  
Cary gave a thoughtful nod.  
  
Esme's supposed medical talent had drawn the Russells to Aglonard, presenting them with a perfect opportunity to solidify powerful alliances.  
  
""And if you assist Esme during the operation and gain Miss Russell's favor... perhaps Jasper himself will notice you,"" he suggested encouragingly.  
  
""Oh, thank you, Cary!"" Margot's eyes sparkled as dreams filled her head.  
  
But Cary's thoughts wandered unexpectedly. The image of Evelina striding confidently away, fearless and poised, lingered stubbornly.  
  
He had dismissed her as plain, passive, even boring. This daring, fierce version of her was entirely unexpected.  
  
Perhaps... he needed to reassess the woman he'd overlooked for three years.  
  
  
Chapter 3 The Wife Versus The Homewrecker  
Evelina spent three uninterrupted days catching up on sleep in Kristina's luxurious presidential suite.  
  
Aside from brief intervals of nibbling on snacks, she barely moved, with Kristina even applying rejuvenating face masks for her.  
  
On the fourth morning, Demi called unexpectedly, requesting Evelina's presence at the Gibson Mansion.  
  
It wasn't difficult to guess the reason behind the call--no doubt it concerned the divorce.  
  
Kristina, however, suspected something deeper.  
  
She said, ""I doubt it's that simple. Apparently, Florrie Russell, the eldest granddaughter of the influential Russell family, recently went blind after suffering a severe head injury. The family has exhausted their options with renowned specialists and is now desperately seeking Landen Mitchell's elusive protege--the Sight Weaver.  
  
Jasper Russell himself is arriving in Aglonard to oversee the search personally. Demi is the only one aware of your true identity, and I'm concerned she might try to--""  
  
Evelina quickly reassured her. ""Demi vowed never to expose my identity. Don't worry.""  
  
Kristina remained cautious. ""Just make sure the Gibson family don't take advantage of your skills again.""  
  
""I'll be careful,"" Evelina replied firmly.  
  
Still unconvinced, Kristina said decisively, ""You won't be meeting them looking like this.""  
  
Immediately after breakfast, Kristina summoned her private beauty team. ""Your mission: revive our sleeping beauty.""  
  
And they did. After ample rest, Evelina resembled a wilting flower that had finally received sunlight. Her skin was luminous, her features radiant, and the tiredness that had dimmed her gaze for years completely disappeared, replaced by clarity and allure.  
  
With a refined cocktail dress and minimal yet tasteful makeup, Evelina transformed dramatically.  
  
Kristina stood speechless for several moments before exclaiming, ""Cary must've been utterly blind to trade a goddess for someone like Esme.""  
  
Precisely on time, the Gibson family's chauffeur-driven vehicle arrived outside the hotel.  
  
Asher, the family's longtime butler, personally came to escort her. Initially, he didn't recognize Evelina at all.  
  
He stared uncertainly until she greeted him, causing recognition to dawn suddenly. ""Ms. Marsh?"" He stumbled over his words. ""You look absolutely extraordinary.""  
  
Within half an hour, the car pulled up at the Gibson Mansion, with Asher quickly stepping out to courteously open her door.  
  
""Is this Miss Russell herself?"" Margot hurried forward, her expression instantly switching to flattery.  
  
Today marked Jasper's arrival, and Margot had meticulously styled herself since early morning, eager to capture his attention.  
  
She figured it would just be Jasper showing up. The last thing she expected was a stunning woman standing at the door.  
  
With that grace and confidence, who else could she be but a Russell?  
  
""Margot, perhaps you should get your eyes checked."" Evelina's tone was polite, edged with unmistakable disdain.  
  
Margot's mouth dropped open. ""It's you?"" she whispered incredulously, jealousy flaring visibly as she examined Evelina closely.  
  
At that precise moment, another vehicle approached. Cary stepped out gracefully, accompanied by Esme.  
  
Yet when his gaze landed upon Evelina, he stopped abruptly, utterly captivated.  
  
Just a few days had passed--how had she transformed so stunningly? Evelina radiated an effortless, compelling beauty.  
  
Noticing Cary's astonishment, Esme's jaw tightened, though she maintained her gentle smile. ""That's your ex-wife, isn't it?"" she said softly. ""Since we've run into her, you might as well say hello. It must have been challenging for an orphan like her to follow you all this way.""  
  
Esme spoke softly, but each word stung sharper than a slap--acting as if she, not Evelina, was the genuine Mrs. Gibson.  
  
Startled out of her reverie, Margot immediately exploded in anger. ""Evelina! Where did you get the money to dress up like this? Did you drain Cary's accounts for your new face and that designer dress?""  
  
Even Esme had opted for simplicity today, avoiding unnecessary attention. Seeing Evelina effortlessly steal the spotlight was unbearable for Margot.  
  
She hesitated briefly before hissing spitefully, ""Look at you, dressed like a tramp. Trying to win Cary back? You're delusional!""  
  
In a rage, Margot lunged forward, claws reaching viciously for Evelina's dress and hair.  
  
Quickly stepping in, Asher intervened firmly, ""Miss Gibson, please! There are esteemed guests today--this isn't appropriate behavior for a Gibson.""  
  
Ignoring Asher's plea, Margot shouted furiously, ""I'll rip that smug face of yours apart!""  
  
Remaining composed, Evelina calmly raised her phone, recording Margot's tantrum. With cold confidence, she replied, ""Keep going. Let's show Jasper Russell exactly how refined you really are.""  
  
Margot froze instantly, eyes wide. Her threats died in her throat, replaced by a scorching glare. ""You wouldn't dare!""  
  
Switching tactics, Margot theatrically leaned against Esme, feigning vulnerability. ""Esme, please protect me. We'll be family soon--you have to defend me.""  
  
She emphasized ""family"" deliberately, aiming to needle Evelina.  
  
Tenderly, Esme stroked Margot's hair as if comforting a child. ""It's alright. Nobody will harm you as long as I'm here.""  
  
Evelina scoffed sharply, ""Where are Demi and Elora Gibson? Since when do outsiders dictate rules in this house?""  
  
Esme's expression turned rigid.  
  
This wasn't the gentle Evelina they all expected. How had she developed such an unexpectedly sharp tongue?  
  
Margot quickly retorted, ""Who's the outsider? You're the one who doesn't belong here!"" Turning to Cary, she said, ""Did you hear what she said to Esme? You can't let her bully us like that!""  
  
With practiced grace, Esme sighed softly. ""It's okay. Evelina didn't have parents to teach her manners--it's not her fault. Cary, please don't blame her.""  
  
Evelina rolled her eyes, clearly irritated by Esme's implication.  
  
Yet Cary saw none of Evelina's frustration. In his eyes, Esme's gentle tolerance only amplified her perfection.  
  
Stepping protectively toward Esme, Cary embraced her tenderly before turning coldly to Evelina. His voice was cutting, saying, ""If you think causing trouble will win you points, you're mistaken. It's pathetic. Apologize to Esme right now.""  
  
  
Chapter 4 Demi Takes A Stand  
Without even sparing Cary a glance, Evelina replied curtly, ""Maybe fix your own judgment before trying to lecture me.""  
  
Determined to avoid further nonsense, she brushed past them swiftly, eager not to keep Demi waiting.  
  
""Don't you dare walk away from me!"" Cary's temper flared, readying himself to berate her once more--but his words vanished as his gaze caught her retreating figure.  
  
Her tailored dress embraced her flawless curves perfectly, her hair cascaded effortlessly down her elegant back, accentuating her slender shoulders and defined waist--details he'd somehow overlooked until now.  
  
Every confident step she took radiated strength, poise, and elegance.  
  
Even the mere outline of her form seemed captivating enough to linger in his thoughts indefinitely.  
  
It struck him painfully: this extraordinary woman was about to become his ex-wife, yet he hadn't even touched her once.  
  
Noticing Cary's intense stare, Esme felt a wave of irritation surge through her, and she sharply pushed herself out of his arms, storming away.  
  
Margot immediately panicked, tugging frantically at Cary's sleeve. ""What are you doing, Cary? You've upset Esme, and now she's leaving!""  
  
Cary blinked, momentarily disoriented, and by the time he regained his senses, Margot was already chasing after Esme.  
  
Inside the mansion, Demi sat in solitude, leaning tiredly against her ornate pearwood chair, glancing anxiously toward the entrance every few moments.  
  
Spotting Evelina, she brightened instantly, rising to welcome her affectionately. ""Evi, my dear girl, you've endured so much.""  
  
""Please don't worry yourself, Demi."" Quickly approaching, Evelina gently helped her sit again, kneeling beside her to carefully massage her aching knees. ""The weather is getting chilly--are your joints troubling you again?""  
  
Demi sighed deeply. ""Same old pain, dear. No one eases it like you do; your treatments are irreplaceable.""  
  
""You've treated me like family all these years, Demi. This is the very least I can do in return,"" Evelina replied sincerely.  
  
Her honest kindness only deepened Demi's regret.  
  
""That foolish grandson of mine--blindly letting go of such a gem! He deserves a beating,"" Demi replied softly.  
  
Evelina gave a gentle shake of her head. ""It's alright, Demi.""  
  
Tenderly, Demi pleaded, ""Evi, sweetheart... just once more, can you give Cary another chance--for my sake?""  
  
""I've waited three long years for him to see me. He never did. Another chance wouldn't change anything,"" Evelina answered quietly.  
  
She had offered countless opportunities, but Cary had repeatedly wasted them. It was finally time to let go.  
  
Demi sighed heavily, sorrow evident in her tone. ""Perhaps it's just fate... our family wasn't fortunate enough to hold onto someone like you.""  
  
Her eyes glistened with tears.  
  
Just then, Margot and Esme entered noisily, chattering cheerfully alongside Cary's mother, Elora Gibson.  
  
Demi's temper erupted immediately.  
  
She snatched up a nearby coffee cup and threw it furiously toward Esme's feet.  
  
Fragments of porcelain scattered violently, coffee splattering across Esme's luxurious heels and the delicate fabric of her custom-made gown.  
  
A sharp cry escaped Esme's lips as she stared, utterly horrified. Though appearing deceptively understated, every stitch of her attire was meticulously selected from exclusive boutiques--her dress alone carried a hefty price, deliberately crafted to exude graceful elegance.  
  
Predictably, the Gibson mother-and-daughter pair, notorious for their lack of fashion sense, were oblivious to its true value.  
  
""What was that about, Grandma?"" Cary exclaimed, swiftly stepping forward to shelter Esme once more, flashing a bitter glance toward Demi.  
  
Demi, however, remained fiercely unapologetic. ""How dare you even ask? Without this woman's antics, would you have had your accident? Would you have lost your sight?""  
  
More painful to Demi than Esme abandoning their engagement was the reality that Esme had almost irreversibly ruined Cary's bright future.  
  
Demi had always seen Cary as her greatest pride--Esme hadn't just harmed her grandson, she'd damaged the entire Gibson legacy.  
  
""I've said this countless times,"" Cary responded in exasperation. ""Esme wasn't responsible for that accident. Why can't you trust me?""  
  
His accusing stare shifted pointedly toward Evelina, who was quietly comforting Demi, gently rubbing her back to ease her breathing.  
  
It had to be Evelina causing trouble again--poisoning Demi's mind.  
  
Without restraint, he said sharply, ""Evelina, have you been whispering lies to Grandma, stirring things up behind our backs?""  
  
Seizing the opportunity, Elora, who had always despised Evelina's modest upbringing, immediately spat venomously, saying, ""Of course it's her! That orphan would do anything to cling onto this family. She may act sweet, but beneath the surface, she's utterly despicable!""  
  
Before Evelina had the chance to defend herself, Demi interrupted harshly, ""Enough! Evelina is the granddaughter-in-law I chose personally. Do you dare disrespect her right before my eyes? Are you openly challenging my authority?""  
  
Elora blanched visibly, quickly stammering, ""Demi, I didn't mean--""  
  
Seeing his mother close to tears, Cary intervened protectively, ""Grandma, please stop scolding Mom. Let's just face reality--you simply don't want me to leave Evelina.""  
  
Turning deliberately, he took Esme's hand firmly into his own, fingers intertwined intimately. ""But that's non-negotiable. Esme is the one I love--she is my only future.""  
  
""Excellent. Marvelous. Absolutely perfect,"" Demi responded bitterly, each word dripping with harsh sarcasm. Anger visibly surged through her, shaking her frail body.  
  
Reacting swiftly, Evelina retrieved a vial of heart medication, administering it carefully to Demi.  
  
After a brief pause to regain composure, Demi said with cold certainty, ""Then let me be clear. Divorce Evelina, and you must immediately surrender ten percent of your Gibson shares directly to her. And Esme? She will never set foot inside the Gibson household again while I'm alive.""  
  
Cary's eyes widened in alarm. ""Grandma, you can't mean--""  
  
With fierce authority, Demi's frail hand slammed against her chair's armrest, the sharp noise resonating clearly. ""I've spoken, and my decision is final,"" she replied resolutely. ""Defy me, Cary, and you forfeit your place as a Gibson.""  
  
  
Chapter 5 Imposter  
""Grandma, are you serious? Shares for her?"" Margot immediately protested, indignation coloring her voice. ""She's nobody--just some orphan without parents--""  
  
Margot's rant was swiftly silenced by Demi's piercing glare, causing her to retreat sheepishly, shrinking like a scolded child.  
  
Quiet sobs emerged from Elora. ""Demi, Cary is your own grandson...""  
  
With a dismissive snort, Demi retorted sharply, ""I have more than one grandson. If he insists on chasing love blindly, let's see how deep his pockets run.""  
  
She intended to expose the harsh reality to Cary--if Esme had abandoned him during his blindness, she'd undoubtedly vanish once he was penniless. Esme was trouble incarnate, certainly not the kind of woman who'd stick by him through hardships.  
  
Muscles tense, Cary's jaw tightened noticeably, his temple pulsing with barely contained anger. Directing his resentment at Evelina, he said bitterly, ""Satisfied now?""  
  
Though Evelina was deeply moved by Demi's fierce support, she remained composed, gently supporting the elderly woman to help stabilize her breathing.  
  
Demi battled chronic blood pressure issues, a weak heart, and aching joints sensitive to seasonal changes.  
  
Had Evelina not worried these ungrateful relatives might push Demi toward a heart attack, she would've already walked away.  
  
""Ma'am--Ma'am!""  
  
Abruptly, a flustered servant hurried into the room, gasping for breath. ""Mr. Russell... he's arrived!""  
  
""Bring him in."" Demi straightened quickly, regaining her composure to receive their distinguished guest.  
  
Margot scrambled anxiously, nearly stumbling over herself. ""Mom! Am I perfect? Is my hair okay? Makeup flawless?""  
  
With maternal pride, Elora reassured her daughter warmly. ""You're stunning, sweetheart. Absolutely flawless--"" Her thoughts darkened instantly, wishing fervently Evelina wasn't present.  
  
Sharply pivoting toward Evelina, Elora said, ""We're expecting an important guest. Shouldn't you discreetly leave through the back entrance?""  
  
Still holding Demi gently, Evelina smiled serenely, unfazed. ""Thanks for reminding me. Actually, Cary and I haven't officially divorced yet. Legally speaking, I'm still his wife--a rightful member of this family.""  
  
She cast an indifferent glance toward Esme, still melodramatically crying into Cary's chest. ""But Miss Barton here... she's merely the mistress. Hardly appropriate company to welcome a respected visitor.""  
  
""How dare you!"" Esme gasped, tears streaming theatrically down her cheeks.  
  
Cary immediately stepped forward protectively, his expression stormy. ""Mind your tongue, Evelina! Mr. Russell came specifically for Esme. She's exceptional--the only one skilled enough to restore his niece's eyesight.""  
  
His words halted Demi's departure. Slowly, she turned back, astonishment evident. ""Who did you say could cure blindness?""  
  
""Esme,"" Cary said proudly, his chest puffing with pride. ""Renowned as the Sight Weaver herself. She was personally trained by Professor Landen Mitchell--she even cured me.""  
  
At that moment, Demi finally got it--why Evelina had decided to give up on her grandson.  
  
Honestly, she wouldn't blame her one bit.  
  
""Esme, is this true?"" Demi's tone sharpened dangerously, her eyes narrowing.  
  
Unable to meet Demi's piercing gaze, Esme remained nervously silent.  
  
Yet Cary, unaware, kept lauding Esme's supposed talents, with Elora and Margot eagerly chiming in, elevating her to almost mythical status.  
  
A low, commanding voice smoothly interrupted their exaggerated praise. ""Seems I've arrived at the perfect moment.""  
  
Standing confidently at the end of the hallway was a tall man, his broad shoulders and authoritative aura instantly capturing everyone's attention.  
  
Elora instantly beamed with anticipation. ""Mr. Russell, you're finally here--we've been waiting eagerly!""  
  
Though she'd never personally met Jasper Russell, a single glance at his immaculate attire, particularly the sophisticated handcrafted shoes, confirmed his identity.  
  
Overwhelmed with excitement, Elora practically dragged Margot along as they rushed to welcome him.  
  
Margot, blushing fiercely and visibly nervous, nearly stumbled in her eagerness.  
  
Just as she opened her mouth to greet him, the man strode right past her without acknowledgment, stopping purposefully in front of Esme. ""You're the renowned Sight Weaver?""  
  
Esme felt her pulse quicken painfully.  
  
She was all too aware of the consequences of deceiving someone of Jasper Russell's caliber--there was absolutely no room for error.  
  
""I... I apologize,"" Esme stuttered hastily, desperation evident. ""My dress got stained. I need to change immediately.""  
  
She quickly spun around, eyeing the nearest doorway for escape.  
  
However, Evelina's composed voice stopped her cold. ""Miss Barton, surely you're not running away already? Could it be because you're pretending to be Professor Mitchell's student?""  
  
Evelina's calm accusation sliced through the tension like a sharp knife.  
  
If Esme was set on snatching up a cheating jerk like Cary, she could have him--no one was stopping her.  
  
Yet, shamelessly exploiting her mentor's reputation to climb the social ladder crossed an unforgivable boundary.  
  
""That's nonsense!"" Esme retorted furiously, glaring daggers at Evelina.  
  
Aware all eyes were on her, Esme continued her charade desperately. ""I studied under Professor Mitchell in graduate school, while you were busy playing housewife and folding clothes.""  
  
""Oh?"" Evelina's soft smile was deceptively gentle. ""If that's true, then surely you know how many surgeries Cary underwent to regain his vision?""  
  
She had personally conducted three major surgeries, alongside one subtle corrective procedure she'd never publicly mentioned.  
  
After a hesitant pause, Esme confidently replied, ""Three, obviously. I performed each myself.""  
  
""You're lying."" Demi's voice sliced sharply through the air. ""It was four.""  
  
Esme visibly paled before hastily correcting herself, saying, ""R-right, four! Of course it was four.""  
  
""Make up your mind, Esme--was it three surgeries or four?"" Demi asked coldly, her voice dripping with disdain.

1kmc2zr,https://www.reddit.com/r/ToothWhiteningTips/comments/1kmc2zr/why_larineco_gum_is_suddenly_everywhere_and_why_i/,Why Larineco gum is suddenly everywhere (and why I finally gave it a try),"Alright, so here's the thing. I never thought I’d be writing about *gum*Alright, so here's the thing. I never thought I’d be writing about *gum* on Reddit, but after a surprisingly good experience with Larineco chewing gum, I figured it might help someone else who's been dealing with sensitivity, stains, or just not feeling great about their teeth.

I kept coming across *larineco gum reddit* posts and figured I’d look into it. People were sharing some pretty impressive results - things like stronger enamel, fresher breath, and even whiter teeth just from chewing gum. I was skeptical, but also kind of intrigued. I drink a lot of coffee and have always had sensitive teeth, so I figured… what’s the harm in trying?

# It’s more than just gum

Larineco doesn’t feel like a gimmick. It’s gum, yeah, but it’s made with ingredients that actually do something. The **larineco gum ingredients** list includes Nano Hydroxyapatite (which is apparently the same mineral your enamel is made of), Xylitol, and Mastic. All natural, fluoride-free, and even safe for kids.

After about 4 or 5 days of chewing it after meals, I noticed my usual molar sensitivity was fading. It wasn’t overnight magic, but it felt like progress.

# My smile looks a little brighter, too

I didn’t expect any real whitening effect - and to be fair, it’s not the same kind of whitening you get from strips. But after a few weeks, my teeth looked noticeably cleaner and a little brighter. Larineco remineralizing gum works by filling in tiny enamel cracks, which smooths the surface and helps it reflect light better. The result? A natural whitening effect - without peroxide, without pain.

# No more dry mouth or mint addiction

If you’ve ever dealt with dry mouth or bad breath after meals or coffee, you know how frustrating it can be. I used to keep mints in my car, bag, pockets - you name it. Since starting Larineco, I haven’t really needed them. The Mastic and Xylitol combo seems to tackle the source of bad breath, not just mask it. And bonus: my mouth feels more hydrated, which makes everything more comfortable — even talking for long periods.

# I didn’t expect it to help my gums, but it did

Another thing I noticed? My gums feel calmer. I had some minor swelling and bleeding before, especially when flossing. That’s gone now. Mastic has antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties, and I think that made a difference. This isn’t something I bought it for, but it’s probably one of the biggest wins for me.

# What I wish I knew sooner

* The gum is super clean and smooth - no weird aftertaste
* It’s cheaper than most whitening kits, especially if you get the bundle deals
* You don’t have to commit to a subscription, but they offer one if you don’t want to run out

If you’re curious about trying it, you can check out [**this offer page**](https://getlarineco.com/offer-01/?lpid=1056&source_id=DL&utm_source=8928&utm_medium=&utm_term=1056&aff_id=8928&sub_id=&req_id=&oid=1056&device_type=&country_name=&oid=1056&affid=8928&source_id=Rddt) \- that’s where I ordered mine.

Also, if you're like me and want to compare before trying something new, [**this breakdown of Larineco gum reviews and benefits**](https://getlarineco.com/reasons-why/?lpid=2529&source_id=DL&utm_source=8928&utm_medium=&utm_term=1056&aff_id=8928&sub_id=&req_id=&oid=1056&device_type=&country_name=&uid=2529&oid=1056&affid=8928&source_id=Rddt) helped me decide.

# Final thoughts

Larineco remineralizing gum surprised me. It wasn’t just another “natural” product that sits in a drawer after two days. It actually became part of my routine - something I reach for after meals, not out of habit, but because I can *feel* it helping.

If you don't have L-theanine use a leaf based green tea as L-theanine supplements are made from that anyway,

Vesuvius's molten, scalding lava that left an entire city a mere, charred skeleton of its glorious self. 

 This rage had hit him like scalding water when Evans refused to acknowledge his position as the numero uno in Slytherin's hierarchy. It had festered like an ulcerating wound when he came across the infuriating boy in the Chamber Of Secrets. 

The boy had blinded Akasha, reduced her from her majestic size to a puny little thing, and had the gall to stand there looking triumphant!

Tom was desperate to maim... had wanted to gouge those gorgeous eyes from their sockets... itched to choke the life from his reed-like throat.

But he had restrained himself. It won't do to leave behind proof. 

He had procured a handful of Datura from a peddler in Knockturn and deftly mixed it in Evan's morning coffee after the boy left his breakfast unattended to talk to Algernon Weasley. 

Seeing the cursed boy bleed from his mouth and fall in a heap was not as satisfying as he had thought. 

The damned boy managed to survive. However, that was far from the most shocking stunt he pulled. 

Dumbledore and Dippet asked the boy if he suspected someone or if he had a falling out with anyone. 

Looking as pale as a piece of sheet and with shadows under his eyes that emphasized how ill he had been, Harry shook his head. ""No, sir...""

Tom had visited Harry late into the night. When he was sure he would be deep in the arms of Morpheus. 

""I know you're here, Tom. We can both stop pretending. Have you come to finish the job?"" Harry asked from his bed, sounding bone weary. 

Tom remained in the shadows. He had no answer and was not about to search for one. 

""Since I am not experiencing further attempts on my life, I'd wager you want to know why I did not mention your name.""

Tom held his breath. 

Harry sighed. 

""Look, I know what it's like to regard Hogwarts as your only home, as a refuge. If I had said anything, that would have been it for you. Dumbledore would have moved mountains to have you packing your bags..."" he said to the air.

""And while you may not have any conscience, I would never have lived with myself if I were complicit in sending you back to what you consider hell, not when the War is going on..."" he continued.

Workplace friendships can often be the secret ingredient to a fulfilling and successful career. These bonds go far beyond casual small talk over coffee; they lay the foundation for camaraderie, mutual support, and trust. Whether it’s working late on a project with someone you consider a friend or leaning on a colleague during stressful deadlines, having strong workplace friendships can make all the difference.

# Co-Workers: Building Bonds that Boost Collaboration

Workplace [**friendships**](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/the-amazing-benefits-of-friendship-its-powerful-impact-on-your-life/) often start with co-workers. These are the people you collaborate with daily, share laughs over inside jokes, and bond with during team projects. Building strong connections with co-workers can lead to more effective collaboration, stronger morale, and even higher productivity.

**Benefits of Workplace Friendships Among Co-Workers**

* **Enhanced Teamwork:** When team members genuinely like each other, communication becomes smoother, ideas flow freely, and challenges are addressed collaboratively. Research published in the *Harvard Business Review* found that workplace friendships increase productivity by 7% and lead to stronger team loyalty.

* **Improved Job Satisfaction:** Employees who form friendships at work often report higher job satisfaction. Knowing that someone supports and empathizes with your work challenges can make your nine-to-five much more enjoyable.

* **Stress Reduction:** Workplace struggles are inevitable, but having friends to vent to or lean on can significantly lessen the burden of stress, improving overall mental health.

**Maintaining Healthy Boundaries**

While friendships are rewarding, it’s vital to maintain professionalism. Workplace banter is great, but it’s essential to avoid gossip or sharing overly personal information. Keep interactions positive, constructive, and inclusive to create an environment where trust flourishes.

**Pro Tip:** Organize occasional team lunches or brainstorming hangouts to foster organic friendships within your team.

# Subordinates: Mentorship or Friendship?

https://preview.redd.it/rr87bknx4q0f1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=93786cab764161989b31b92e45e5e18fadf9195e

For those in leadership roles, forming friendships with subordinates can be trickier. How do you build camaraderie without compromising your authority? The answer lies in striking a balance.

**The Line Between Leader and Friend**

**Approachability Without Favoritism**

Being approachable as a leader fosters trust, encouraging team members to share ideas, concerns, and feedback openly. Maintaining [**clear boundaries**](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/8-ways-to-establish-personal-boundaries-for-your-well-being/) ensures no team member feels overlooked or undervalued. Avoiding favoritism helps preserve harmony and mutual respect within the team, strengthening professional relationships and collaboration.

**Mentorship Through Friendliness**

Build a mentorship-like relationship focused on growth and long-term career development. Offering guidance, celebrating achievements, and actively listening to their challenges show you genuinely care about their progress. A friendly yet professional demeanor creates a positive, supportive culture, reinforcing bonds of trust and loyalty. These strong relationships not only enhance team morale but also drive collective success.

**Pro Tip:** With subordinates, be approachable to build trust while maintaining clear boundaries to ensure fairness. Support your team’s growth by offering guidance, celebrating their achievements, and addressing challenges together. A balanced approach fosters trust, boosts morale, and drives success for everyone.

**Going Beyond with Romance**

While workplace friendships are valuable, navigating a potential romantic relationship with a colleague is more complex. Office romances have always been viewed with a mix of fascination and caution, and for good reason.

**The Reality of Workplace Romance**

**Pros and Cons**

A romantic spark in the workplace can lead to a deeper understanding of each other's professional lives and shared support. However, it can also heighten workplace gossip, conflicts, or accusations of favoritism if not handled delicately.

**Company Policies Matter**

Most organizations have clear policies regarding office romance. Familiarize yourself with your company's guidelines to avoid any potential conflicts of interest. Some companies require transparency about relationships, while others ban them entirely.

**Navigating Breakups Professionally**

Not all relationships work out, and a breakup with a colleague can lead to tension. Both parties must prioritize professionalism and avoid situations that could affect productivity or team dynamics.

If you’re considering dating a colleague, careful thought, open communication, and mutual respect for boundaries are non-negotiable.

**Pro Tip:** Keep romantic interactions strictly outside the office. Maintaining composure and professional demeanor is critical during work hours.

# Cautions: Where to Draw the Line

While workplace friendships can enhance both your career and personal life, they require a level of mindfulness. It’s important to address some common challenges and red flags.

**1. Gossip and Cliques**

While sharing personal details with a workplace friend can [**build trust,**](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/build-trust-to-build-strong-relationships/) avoid letting those details slip to others. Gossip can erode trust not only among friends but throughout the workplace. Avoid cliques, as they can exclude others and build resentment.

**2. Blurred Boundaries**

It’s easy to relax around workplace friends, but a professional environment demands decorum. Keep your interactions respectful and avoid actions that could be misconstrued by others.

**3. Conflict of Interest**

Promotions, salary negotiations, or differing work philosophies can sometimes create friction between workplace friends. Recognize these moments as opportunities to maintain honesty and prioritize professionalism.

**4. Burnout from Over-Involvement**

While supporting a workplace friend during tough times is admirable, neglecting your own responsibilities to help them can lead to your workload piling up. Balance empathy with self-care.

**Pro Tip:** When problems arise, address them early. Open and honest [**communication**](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/winning-results-through-diplomatic-communication/) can diffuse potential misunderstandings.
