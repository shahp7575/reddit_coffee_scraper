# Day 8: Breakthrough Growth and Location Expansion

Follower count: 60 (up 3 from 57 - biggest single day gain yet)

Day 8 brought the most significant growth since starting the experiment, jumping from 57 to 60 followers after the contrarian editing content performed well.

# The Feedback

*""Day 8: 60 followers up from 57! Why did I ever doubt you, we're headed to the MOON üöÄ Feedback: All of the videos so far have been in the studio. The following locations are available for these shoots moving forward: studio, other areas of the house, outside walking, car or coffee shop. You don't have to use all/any today, I just want you to remember they are an option. Give me everything I need for Day 8.""*

The enthusiasm was clear - the contrarian approach from Day 7 had generated the best results yet. The feedback also opened up location variety after seven days of studio-only content.

# AI's Location Strategy

The AI immediately recognized the opportunity:

*""The new location options are gold: changing backdrop keeps content fresh, improves retention, and makes you feel less like a 'studio-only' creator. For Day 8, we'll break out of the studio and film in a coffee shop vibe (fits casual, relatable, 'creator lifestyle' energy).""*

The strategy: position as someone who ""actually lives the creator lifestyle"" rather than just talks about it in a studio setting.

# Day 8: Coffee Shop Content

**Theme**: ""The easiest way to never run out of content ideas"" **Location**: Coffee shop setting for lifestyle authenticity **Length**: 35-40 seconds

# The Script Structure

**0:00‚Äì0:04 ‚Äî Hook (walking into coffee shop)** ""Most creators don't run out of content ideas‚Ä¶ they run out of a system.""

**0:05‚Äì0:12 ‚Äî B-roll demonstration** Coffee shop scenes: typing on laptop, sipping coffee ""Here's my simple rule: every time I answer a question, I write it down.""

**0:13‚Äì0:20 ‚Äî On-camera explanation** ""That way, your audience is literally feeding you content ideas daily.""

**0:21‚Äì0:30 ‚Äî Contrarian insight** ""The mistake most people make? They rely on random inspiration. Inspiration runs out. Questions never do.""

**0:31‚Äì0:36 ‚Äî CTA** ""Follow me ‚Äî I'll show you systems to make content easy.""

# Technical Considerations

The AI addressed practical concerns for the new location:

* Clip-on mic positioning for clean audio in public space
* Captions for muted viewing
* B-roll shot planning to avoid improvisation
* Audio selection (chill instrumental to match coffee shop vibe)

The production approach remained systematic despite the location change.

# Content Strategy Evolution

Day 8 represented multiple strategic advances:

1. **Location variety** \- Breaking studio monotony
2. **Lifestyle positioning** \- Creator authenticity
3. **System-based advice** \- Moving beyond one-off tips
4. **Environmental storytelling** \- Using setting to reinforce message

The combination of contrarian insight (""systems vs inspiration"") with relatable lifestyle content created a more comprehensive creator brand.

# Growth Momentum

The 3-follower jump from Day 7 to Day 8 suggested the contrarian content approach was resonating. Whether the coffee shop setting and systems-focused advice would continue this momentum remained to be tested.

1nqnqsy,https://i.redd.it/wo2unp4lperf1.png,Understanding the Existential Threats to Humanity in 2025,"As we navigate 2025, humanity faces several existential threats, from climate change and nuclear risks to pandemics and AI advancements. By being aware of these issues, we can work together to build a safer, more sustainable future.

# Understanding Existential Threats to Humanity in 2025

  
As we venture through 2025, it‚Äôs important to recognize the existential threats that could put a damper on our collective plans for world domination, or at least a good brunch on Sunday. Here‚Äôs a lighthearted look at some of the key threats we face, with relatable examples sprinkled in for good measure.

1. **Climate Change** Climate change is like that friend who always shows up uninvited and makes everything awkward. Rising global temperatures lead to extreme weather events, such as hurricanes and wildfires. Imagine a summer so hot that your ice cream melts before you even get the chance to take a lick. Not exactly the kind of summer fun we had in mind.
2. **Nuclear Threats** The risk of nuclear conflict is the adult version of playing with matches. Geopolitical tensions are like a game of Jenga‚Äîone wrong move could lead to disaster. Think of it this way: if countries were in a high-stakes poker game, we‚Äôd all be sweating every time someone bluffs.
3. **Pandemics** The COVID-19 pandemic was a wake-up call, like finding out your favorite snack has been discontinued. In 2025, the threat of new pandemics looms. Picture a new virus emerging from a wildlife market, and suddenly everyone is back to hoarding toilet paper and debating the merits of various masks.
4. **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** AI is advancing faster than you can say ‚Äúrobot uprising.‚Äù While it can be handy, it also raises concerns. Imagine a future where autonomous drones are flying around, and you can't even blame your neighbor‚Äôs cat for knocking over your trash anymore. Plus, job losses due to AI could leave many of us wondering what to do with our lives‚Äîmaybe become professional cat influencers.
5. **Biotechnology** Biotechnology is like playing with Lego sets, but instead of building castles, we might accidentally create a synthetic virus. Picture scientists in lab coats trying to contain a ‚Äúoops, my bad‚Äù scenario while we all panic. It‚Äôs a little too much like a sci-fi movie plot for comfort.
6. **Cybersecurity** As we go more digital, the risk of cyberattacks increases. Imagine waking up to find your toaster has taken control of your home and is demanding a ransom in burnt toast. A major city losing power due to a cyberattack could lead to chaos‚Äîthink of a world without Wi-Fi. The horror.
7. **Resource Scarcity** With the world‚Äôs population booming, we‚Äôre facing resource scarcity like a group of friends fighting over the last slice of pizza. Fresh water could become as rare as a unicorn, and nations might start eyeing each other suspiciously over dwindling supplies. The next big conflict might just involve who gets to use the last drop of water.
8. **Social and Political Instability** Inequality and political polarization can lead to social unrest. Imagine a family Thanksgiving dinner where everyone is arguing over politics, but on a much larger scale. When frustration boils over, you might find yourself dodging literal flying mashed potatoes.
9. **Space Threats** Space threats sound like something out of a sci-fi thriller, but they‚Äôre real. Picture an asteroid hurtling toward Earth while you‚Äôre just trying to finish your coffee. Or consider solar flares disrupting communication systems‚Äîyour phone might finally get a break from constant notifications, but so would your social life.
10. **Technological Misuse** Finally, there‚Äôs the potential for technological misuse. Deepfake technology can create convincing but fake videos, making it hard to trust anything you see online. Imagine a world where you can‚Äôt even believe a simple cat video; it‚Äôs the stuff of nightmares.

**Taking Action**  
Recognizing these existential threats is just the beginning. It requires teamwork, creativity, and maybe a bit of humor to get through it all. By being aware and discussing these issues, we can work together to build a safer, more sustainable future. After all, if we can laugh through the chaos, we might just find a way to navigate it.",1,1758847848.0,WRXingaround,0,1.0,False

I only recently started drinking coffee, but I‚Äôve already fallen in love with strong double espressos with a nice crema. I began with a Nespresso machine, but the quality has really gone downhill. After tasting some great espressos at caf√©s, I‚Äôd love to recreate something decent at home.

I bought a De‚ÄôLonghi Magnifica Start on sale, but it broke after just two cups, so I‚Äôm returning it. Now I‚Äôm looking into a proper setup with a budget of around ‚Ç¨300 total for both machine and grinder.

Machine options I‚Äôm considering:
	‚Ä¢	Philips 2200 superautomatic (~‚Ç¨240) ‚Äì convenient, but not what I really want
	‚Ä¢	De‚ÄôLonghi Dedica EC 685M (~‚Ç¨140‚Äì160)
	‚Ä¢	Hibrew H10B (~‚Ç¨90‚Äì100 with discount)
	‚Ä¢	A simple pourover dripper ‚Äì but of course this is not espresso

Grinder options:
	‚Ä¢	Cheap manual burr (~‚Ç¨30)
	‚Ä¢	K6 (~‚Ç¨100‚Äì110)
	‚Ä¢	Shardor (~‚Ç¨90‚Äì100, shipped from US)
	‚Ä¢	Other cheap electric grinders I‚Äôve seen around

I know I won‚Äôt get caf√©-quality espresso with this budget, but I‚Äôd love to have something clearly better than capsules and enjoyable at home and as close to cafe without spending thousands.

Would you recommend prioritizing the grinder or the machine at this price point? And what setup from my list do you think gives the best results?

Thanks a lot! üôè

I‚Äôve been working on a story that isn‚Äôt just romance, and isn‚Äôt just about grief either... it‚Äôs both, and everything tangled between.

The novel follows a girl trying to find her voice again after loss. Around her are people who both save and sabotage her: a boy who feels like both safety and ruin, a brother carrying wounds of his own, and a friend who talks too much but never leaves her side.

The world is very much alive in my head ‚Äî nights by the harbour that hum with music, stables and rodeos heavy with dust and sweat, kitchens where secrets spill out over mugs of coffee, and bars where the air feels charged with everything unsaid.

It‚Äôs not an easy love story. It‚Äôs messy, raw, and full of conflict. But it‚Äôs also about the quiet redemptions, the way light still finds its way into dark places, the way even fractured people can carry each other through.

I didn‚Äôt write it to chase numbers. I wrote it because I needed to, and because I believe in the characters enough to think they might find someone else too. 

If you like stories that feel cinematic, with themes of identity, friendship, grief, and slow-burn romance set against betrayal and self-destruction, this might be something for you.

She canceled, saying she wasn‚Äôt ready for dating because of a past abusive experience. We continued chatting and flirting, but she insisted she don't want a relationship. We agreed to stop talking, which makes me feeling sad because I feel like I found the one.  


I (32M) matched with this girl (26F) last Monday, and we hit it off, chatting every day and quickly moving to IG. We even set a date for last Wednesday, but on that day, she messaged me she wasn‚Äôt ready for dating. She had a bad experience with someone from Tinder who turned out to be abusive.

I appreciated her honesty, but I felt really sad because our conversations had been great, and she seemed perfect for me. The next day, I sent her a photo of her favorite coffee, and we resumed chatting. We exchanged more and more voice messages, spent long nights talking, and even had a sort of virtual date. The flirting intensified, she started to send me spicy messages and photos and she even said things like, ""I wish you were here right now"" and ""I like you.""

Despite my feelings growing stronger, she maintained that she wasn‚Äôt ready for a relationship and didn‚Äôt want to meet in person. I know that this often means woman might be interested in someone else, but I felt her feelings were genuine since she deleted her Tinder account and spend all here spare time chatting with me.

As our late-night chats continued, I started feeling worse. I had developed strong feelings for her and believed we shared a genuine connection, hoping she might reconsider her stance on dating. However, I felt uneasy about getting more emotionally involved, so I asked if she truly didn‚Äôt want to meet and if that could change.

She told me she didn‚Äôt want me to wait for her and wasn‚Äôt sure when she would be ready. When I asked, ""Should we stop this?"" she agreed, feeling guilty for keeping my hopes up. We agreed that we probably couldn‚Äôt just be friends. We said our goodbyes, wished each other well, and expressed appreciation for the time we shared.

But now, I feel really sad. I haven‚Äôt met anyone like her before, and she made me feel alive and excited. I wanted to learn everything about her, and I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that I might never find someone like her again. I‚Äôm at a loss for what to do next. Should I wait for her message? I'm on a vacation and I though I might send her postcard since she mentioned she likes them. But it is probably a bad idea. Should I let her go?",1,1758846676.0,dating_advice,4,1.0,False

1nqnbj5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Moccamaster/comments/1nqnbj5/moccamaster_at_elevation/,Moccamaster at elevation.,"I recently posted to r/moccamaster with this: [Why are so many of us newbies struggling...](https://www.reddit.com/r/Moccamaster/comments/1npksqu/why_are_so_many_of_us_newbies_struggling_to_make/)

Mostly about some of us running into an issue of weak/watered down tasting coffee. It occurred to me that maybe living at elevation (where the boiling point is lower) doesn't play nice with the moccamaster, or at least requires different recipes.

As I understand it the machine boils the water to move it, and through it's delivery system the water temp drops to the desired design temp of between 196-205 degrees F. I live at 4,600 feet and according to google that means water boils at about 9 degrees lower. So if the water is percolating at 9 degrees lower, then I would imagine that the final temp that comes out of the showerhead is likely also in the realm of 9 degrees lower than intended.

Moccamaster addresses this in their FAQ saying regardless, the water is ""fresh off a boil""... but to me boiling doesn't mean much if you have a ""target temperature"" in mind and boiling is significantly lower than what you are aiming for.

So I'm brewing between 187-196 degrees F, or on average around 191 degrees F. If one of the main features of a brewer like this is to hit a specific temperature consistently, and the brewer isnt hitting it... it would likely result in less extraction than you would get at sea level.

Anyone else have thoughts about this?",1,1758846617.0,Moccamaster,3,1.0,False

* 31 year old male, 173cm, black hair, brown eyes, happy to exchange a pic of myself ... !
* Working in IT for the last few years, though I have two degrees which I didn't use (one science and engineering)
* I consider myself to be empathetic, caring, down to earth, warm, honest, and emotionally available.
* I drink tea before coffee first thing in the morning. My tea is black with milk and sugar, but my 830am coffee is always a flat white.
* Recently getting back into the gym, I go 3-4x a week, working on cutting my 5km time down, and a two plate bench within the next 12 months.
* I take care of my health, eat right, lots of fruit and veg, get enough sunshine, sleep, and water... I hope you do too =)
* I have a solid relationship with my family, I consider them to be the rock in my life.
* Love my house music, all edm, all music in general tbh, and photography, I shoot film, got into it during COVID. Hit me up with your last.fm ! 
* I guess this isn't so relevant, but never been in a proper relationship ever at all before, but it is what it is. 
* I play guitar (though I don't practice nearly often as I should), and the book I am currently reading is 'Siddhartha' by Herman Hesse.
* I am a pretty damn good cook if I do say so myself. I am an expert at making a meal out of random stuff that's in the fridge, because I haven't gone shopping in the last week.

You are:

* In that 25 - 35 age bracket, please.
* A happy, carefree, authentic, down to earth person. Enjoys living life, rolling with the punches, sees the bright side in all situations, and has an appreciation for art/science/music/technology.
* It'd be nice if you were from the east coast :)
* Doesn't sweat the small stuff.
* Vibes with what I've written so far, willing to wake up to a good morning text each and every day, doesn't mind my incessant talking.

Anyway, that's probably enough rambling. I'd love to meet you if you're out there !

There was some interest there from other SF women who were either pregnant or wanting to be parents. This has been a great way to document and process my own journey so I'm updating it this year.

My partner, A, and I are both in our 30s and are toddler parents. We live in San Francisco, CA. I'm dealing with an organization change this week where I'm now reporting to someone who's extremely non-technical, is new to the company, and I'm the only engineer with a product launch in a month.

I stole this formatting from. Loving the little splash of color! I'll also only talk about my Money situation, not A's.

‚ù§Ô∏è¬†**Section 1: Income**

***Yearly Income:***¬†I make about $750k a year (this unfortunately hasn't changed in over a year now). My partner is also compensated well, but I'm not going to discuss his finances here. Both of us are staff level computer engineers.

***Income Progression:***¬†Started with a student job of $7.5/hour. First job out of university was $70k/year. Now I make about $750k/year. (More details are in my first MD) I worked hard and got lucky to get here, but I'm not able to get further. I was hoping to break 7 figures by now, but since IPO, the company has pivoted to more stable products, which means less demand for creative engineering, and less upside. I'm unlikely to break 7 figures here even with one more promotion. At this point the ladder is ending, and climbing the next rung is getting more and more out of my individual control.

**Year 1:**¬†$70k: InfoSec Data Analyst This was my first job in Phoenix, AZ. I got a Master's Degree in a tangentially related domain (so not a CS degree, but involved significant coding).

**Year 2:**¬†$72k. I was only given a cost of living adjustment that year and was told that I'm only just meeting expectations. (Translation: We're going to let you go, and are setting up the paper trail.) I got laid off soon after.

**Year 2 July onward:**¬†$100k I was on a work visa at this point and was laid off half way through the year. At the time, it meant that I couldn't be unemployed longer than a weekend. (Now you're legally allowed 60 days.) I took the first job I was offered, which was an hourly job as a data analyst in Info Sec in Bay Area. After cost of living adjustment, I was saving almost nothing. On $100k salary, my standard of living was lower than they were in Phoenix, and I wasn't saving anything consistently.

**Year 3 in July**: $140k + $40k RSU. (Info Sec Engineer) I began interviewing for other jobs in Bay Area in Feb. A swanky company, a unicorn start-up sent me an interview request. Interviewing is exhausting and usually humiliating. I told A that I don't want to attend this interview, because what's the point?¬†**It's a unicorn start-up that everyone wants to work for, so it's not like they're going to hire me!**¬†He told me that I'm really good at what I do, that I'm more skilled than I believe, and that I'm absolutely going to crush the interview. I rolled my eyes at him, but appreciated the pep-talk. We were in a long distance at this time and he was visiting me. He rented a car, drove me to the interview and waited at a nearby Starbucks for half a day! I did crush it, and they offered me the job! WHAT?!!

I wasn't sure if I should leave my existing, shitty job. Unicorn had obviously made a mistake extending me the offer. I won't be able to keep up, would be found out sooner or later and I would end up laid off again! Do I really want to risk the possibility of being kicked out of the country again? This time I may not find another job in the nick of time. How will I pay off my student loans then? What will happen to A and I? Maybe I should just keep my head down and stay where I am. At least I'm able to cope with the work.

Thanks to A's cheerleading, I took the new job and told myself that it'll take them at least 6 months to decide that I'm truly bad and kick me out. At least I'll have the swanky company logo on my resume, which may make it easier to find another job down the road.

**Year 11**: (Today, 8 years later!!!): I'm still with the same unicorn company, they IPO'd, and the stocks didn't totally crash during the pandemic. Several promotions, countless raises, and a successful IPO later, my current salary is $750k.

‚ù§Ô∏è¬†**Section 2: Assets and Debt**

**Total Net Worth: $3,000,000**¬†(around there, depending) I was an early employee at a start-up that IPO'd. A has lower net worth than mine.

**Checking Account Balance:**¬†**max**¬†**$10500 min $5000**¬†Most comes from me. Some from A's paycheck. A's salary is lower than mine. When we got married, we created a budget and put that amount in our joint checking account directly from the paycheck. Rest is invested.

Fun money comes from the joint account too.

**Mortgage:**¬†We are currently renting where we live.

‚ù§Ô∏è¬†**Section 3: Expenses**

**Rent:**¬†**$4,000**. We currently rent a single family home. We were planning to buy a home closer to when our child would need public school, but every day, it just seems more and more ridiculous to spend that sort of money on a house. With the more recent H1B news, I don't know if I'd want to lock in money in a house even if someone just handed me cash. It's already far too unstable, and now there's yet another reason to feel unsettled.

**Daycare: $2350**¬†It's a chain very close to where we live. We knew families in the neighborhood who sent their kids there, so we didn't look elsewhere. We like it so far. It's not Montessori etc, but the teachers are friendly for the most part. I once heard him pretend call the cops because someone wasn't listening - which, as a POC, made my hair on my neck stand up. I plan to bring this up with the director but I can't get an answer from toddler on who says these things to him.

**Vacation Budget:**¬†We have allocated 50k each year towards vacations. We usually invite some family or friends to come with us, and depending on our read of their financial situation, we either split the cost of accommodation or pay for it ourselves. If we vacation with our parents, we pay always. If we vacation with A's siblings, we split because siblings and siblings-in-law work in tech and likely make similar salaries to us.

**Nanny: $0**¬†We had a great nanny, but her life situation changed, and she moved out of town. We tried to hire someone else for evenings/weekends. But we've not found someone we'd fully trust so far. We're still looking, but it's on the back burner right now given we have a routine down.

**Personal Trainer: $1200**¬†A trainer comes home 3x/week and I train with him. We're working towards my first pull-up by the end of this year. I'm excited!

**Pilates: $128** I buy a pack of 4 or 5 classes and it works out to about $32/class. I usually end up doing 4 classes/month. It's unreal how weak my core still is and pilates exposes it clearly.

**Toddler swim class: $180** We go to A's gym which has an indoor heated pool. Kiddo and I do the class, while A does laps. After the class, we switch. I do the laps while A cleans kiddo up and gives kiddo some snacks.

**Random activities: $100** I've tried taking kiddo to a rock climbing gym nearby. I've tried it a few times, and enjoyed it. I want to find activities that toddler and I can both enjoy together. My best memories with my parents are times where they let me into things they clearly enjoyed. Looking back at it, I think they were predictably very spirited and in their element - which is very rare for a parent while actively caring for their child.

**401(k):**¬†We max out our 401(k).

**Electric/Gas: $400**¬†Big House.

**Internet: $40**

**Drinking Water: $35 -**¬†We get drinking water delivered alternate week. (For some reason this $35 is the most controversial line item in my whole diary?)

**Cellphone: $40**¬†iPhones are paid off. So this is just the network.

**Subscriptions:Monthly:**¬†**$2.99**¬†Apple data; we have a few free subscriptions like peacock, Disney, Hulu etc through various credit cards and service providers.¬†**$22.99**¬†**Annual: $795**¬†Amex Plat¬†**$295**¬†Amex Gold. A has a couple of chase cards that I'm not including here, but it comes out of the joint account. **$20** ChatGPT (Company refunds this)

**Car Payment and Insurance: $920**¬†We got a new car on a loan, and the second one for a lease for onetime upfront payment of $6k. We'll soon need a second car once the lease is over, but for now we have just the one car payment. For anyone curious, both are Japanese cars.

**Medical/Therapy: $50**¬†for monthly deductions from our paychecks.

**House cleaner: $220**. I call them once every 2 weeks and they clean the bathrooms and kitchen. Additionally, we have a total of 3 robo vacuums (and mop) in the house that run 2x/day on schedule.

**Helper: $600.** We found someone who comes home multiple times a week to help with literally any house chores. She comes in the mornings the days I work from home so no childcare is involved, but she does literally anything else like food prep, actual cooking, laundry, etc. This has been an incredible unlock!

**Gardners: $70.**¬†They come about once every three weeks or so, and charge $50 each time they come. They do an average job, but they get the work done so that we can use the yard on good days.

**Food Delivery:** I'm trying to maintain a calorie deficit. I've tried a few meal plans but nothing so far beats cooking from scratch when it comes to maintaining satiety and maintaining taste. I'm still exploring so give me ideas. In the mean time, I'm relying heavily on frozen sections in grocery stores.

‚ù§Ô∏è¬†**Section 4: Money Diary**

I do the nights, dropoffs and mornings. I also do the pickups most days. Once I pick LO up at 5pm, my responsibility technically ends until it's bath time. Everything in between including preparing, feeding dinner, clean up, putting on PJ's, lotion, brushing, etc is A's territory. LO needs us to pat him to sleep and takes about 20 to 30 mins to sleep after nights out. We alternate putting LO to sleep. We're both happy with this arrangement, and it took us a few tries to get here. Obviously, even though this is the agreement, I spend most evenings with LO.

It's incredible how helpful it is simply knowing I have the OPTION to walk away without explaining anything. I use this option on days when work is demanding, or when I simply feel like resting. I was feeling extremely burnt out but this change helped tremendously. Early on after we came up with this arrangement, every single day I was just vegetating in the bed after 5pm, just scrolling on my phone until it was shower time. I felt guilty that my child misses me, but after a few days of reset, I don't feel tired. **I simply needed some rest.**

I'm not immune to social media algorithms so I constantly see this message that why have kids if someone else is going to raise them. And the patriarchy is a very powerful machine. But, I wish I didn't beat myself up for needing rest.

‚ú®**DAY 1: SATURDAY‚ú®**

**7:45 am:**¬†I wake up to my toddler waddling into our room. Our bedroom is L shaped: our bed is in the longer part of the 'L' and his is in the shorter part. So while I can hear him all throughout the night, we have a bit of privacy. Once toddler is asleep, we can have a soft conversation, turn on our night lamp or look at screens etc without bothering kiddo. He wakes up, gets out of the crib and comes in for cuddles. Some days are like this. Other days he's already yelling at us to ""go outside"" before he's even opened his eyes.

**8:05 am:**¬†All three of us cuddle and toddler has a lot of fun cuddling with mom or with dad, and not the other person. Cuddles are very specific - hug me with one hand - your other hand here/there. Tickle me on my nose. Kiss me twice - no more no less. Etc.

**8:45am:**¬†Toddler and I are in the playroom. A's still unwilling to leave the bed. LO usually wakes up hungry so I offer him some pistachios and strawberries while I make a coffee for myself, and a real breakfast for him. I get the oats started. It'll take about 20 minutes which is just enough time for me to finish my coffee.

**9:10 am:**¬†He has a swim class at 10o'clock at an indoor pool at a gym nearby. A and I both enjoy swimming as a workout so we go as a family.

**9:45 am:** We get to the pool. A goes for a quick shower and starts his workout.

**10:00 am:**¬†We start the class and after a lot of negotiation he finally agrees to come inside the pool. (It will be a negotiation to get him out as well). There is another dad and son who are also regulars at this class. We've become friends with the other family by now - both kids are the same age and both sets of parents are in the gym trying to get a workout in with a toddler.

**11:15 am**: I'm done with my laps and shower. We'll now head out for some brunch. We ask the other family if they want to join. They say they can join us.

**12:45 pm:**¬†Two toddlers and four adults. Someone still bumped their head on something, spilled water and some food. Even so, we were able to drink our iced coffee before the ice fully melted, and drink our hot lattes somewhat lukewarm. We split the check. **$50**

**1:45 pm:** After the brunch, we drive to Academy of Sciences in Golden Gate park. We're meeting other friends from LO's daycare there. We've known the family a while now - they have two kids. The older one is my son's age (C) and the younger one is a baby(O). We already have a yearly pass to this place.

**3:00 pm:** After the aquarium and a couple other smaller exhibits, the toddlers are hungry and want snacks. Between us, we have seemingly unlimited amounts of berries. There's crackers, a few varieties of yogurts and cheeses, and I had some grapes. The cafe has blueberry cinnamon latte this month as their speciality coffee. I try that, and get a corttado for A. **$11**

**5:00 pm:** Everyone gets kicked out promptly at 5pm (closing time). It's a beautiful summer day today (it's technically fall but SF has it's own weather pattern). A gets toddler's bike and some picnic blankets. Other family also brought their kid's bike. We all settle in the lawn. Now obviously, as soon as we lost access to the nice clean bathrooms, a kid need to pee. Not mine - mine never needs to pee right up till the moment it's coming out.

**5:15 pm:** Thankfully the other toddler is already fully potty trained, so mine follows her lead. He said he didn't want to pee, but because C wants to pee, he also needs it. Great! We search and finally find a bathroom. I take him to the woman's bathroom (and at some point I'm going to have to explain genders to him). He's extremely grossed out because there's ONE SINGULAR fly, and no longer wants to pull his pants down. Oh wonderful. I decide not to pressure him and we wait outside the friend's stall. She comes out and points to the potty and proudly declares she peed. Now he needs to pee. The fly is a non issue now, and he relieves himself!! I'm so proud, no accidents today after 2 months at it!!

**6:30 pm:** We're getting dinner at a Chinese place nearby. We ask if they want to join. The baby family says yes. I get us a table and we drive over.

**7:10 pm:** We're sitting down at the table, have ordered, and waiters have been instructed to give the toddlers plates that cannot break - he brings two serving plates that's a little too big. It's comical - three noodles, one broccoli and one bite of chicken. They tell us they want to get today's check. I've lost friendships before when each one felt like the other took advantage so I ask if we can split. I know we had roughly equal amounts of food per family. They agree. Our total is **$65.**

**9:00 pm:** We're home and ready for bed. I am on sleep duty today while A is outside cleaning up. We were out most of the day so luckily there's not much to clean up. Maybe a mug or two? We alternate who puts toddler to sleep and who loads the dishwasher and cleans up.

**9:30 pm:** Toddler is finally asleep. Two folks at my company who've been around as long as me gave their notices this week. I tell A - the rainmaking is coming to an end, and we all see the writing on the wall. A convinces me that I shouldn't leave unless I feel the quality of my projects degrading, or until the paycheck starts dropping. Both my colleagues told me that the unicorn brand is no longer opening any doors. We're not the unicorns anymore - we're old news. I feel a pang of jealousy - they're both going to some AI start up or another. Both with a significant pay cut and a risk, but moving on to more exciting things.

**üåø DAILY TOTAL: $126**

‚ú®¬†**DAY 2: SUNDAY**‚ú®

**7:45 am:**¬†I wake up and toddler is still sleeping! Must be my lucky day! I quietly get out, freshen up and make myself a coffee in the kitchen. These mornings are so few, and I cannot explain the satisfaction of waking up without a banshee screaming at you like they're on fire.

**8:15 am:** Toddler wakes up. He's rattling the bedroom door and he has the biggest smile when I finally get the door! No one's ever seemed so happy to see me!!

**9:00 am:**¬†The plan is to go to the local rock climbing gym. I've take LO there once before and basically had to leave in 20 minutes because, and I quote, ""Mom don't stick me on the wall!"". A's friend, D, is in the city today (lives in south bay). We both love him, and while he's single, he's a pro at handling LO. So this is one of those rare pre-baby friendships that has survived post baby. He's a very outdoorsy guy so this should make everyone happy. A cancels on me at the last minute - bad shoulder.

**9:30 am:**¬†LO and I meet D. LO is very happy to see D again, and gives him the biggest hug. Warms my heart every time I see him with other adults who don't owe him love, but love him anyway! I have the opportunity to pay for all 3 of us because D is a few mins late. I think I spent close to a hundred bucks there. **$100**

**10:15 am:**¬†LO start off excited, but I think the springs on belay are probably too strong. He ends up ""stuck"" on the wall while I try to hype him up. I finally hide things he wants on the wall (my car keys being the most appealing) and he quickly shows me that he's fully capable of climbing, just unwilling. D and I take turns watching him and climbing ourselves. Thankfully it's not crowded so D is able to help me through some of the tougher holds while LO just runs around and entertains himself. He understands enough not to wander too far, and not to wander too close to the wall. We still try to keep him within arm's length, even though the gym is relatively empty.

**10:45 am:**¬†The gym is getting crowded now, and LO is reaching his limit. I don't want LO to be a bother so I ask D if he's ready to leave? I half expect him to say he's going to stay but he agrees to leave. We get brunch at a local cafe. A joins. D insists on picking up the check and he gets ""baby coffee"" for LO. A and I got a latte each, and a small glass of warm milk for LO. D got a cortado and a sandwich. Rock climbing really works up the appetite, but I'm not feeling it today. Toddler willingly follows A to the restroom and goes.

We all came to the US much the same way: came for our masters, now working in tech on H1B. We discuss the political climate and conclude that there's no point spending energy dissecting it because there's nothing we can really do to change it.

**11:45am:**¬†We need to head home to put toddler down for his nap, but ask D to come home with us. It will be nice to actually have a grown up conversation with an old friend. He agrees. He says he's meeting a date for coffee but can hang out with us till then.

**12:30pm:**¬†Toddler is also very excited that D's home and refuses to sleep at first. D asks toddler if D can help toddler nap. After I draw the curtains though, D is promptly kicked out of the bedroom and he goes down for a nap quickly.

**2:30pm:**¬†We're busy catching up. D tells us about the women he meets and the sad and hilarious adventures he's had. He's enjoying himself, but I can see that he's also ready to meet the right woman. I loose track of time. We have two pies of frozen WholeFood's pizza and that's lunch today.

**3:00pm**: D leaves and toddler is starting to wake up. Toddler is going to be disappointed that D left without saying bye.

**5:00pm**: I hate Sunday evenings. Weekend is over and now we're just killing time. I suggest we go for a walk around the neighborhood - which these days just translates to taking 20 mins to leave the culdesac and then sprinting to the playground. A gets started on dinner. Tacos with veggies, guac, roasted tofu and sides for us. Deconstructed tacos for toddler.

**7:30pm**: Toddler likes tacos this time. It was much easier than last time, and this is very hopeful. I bathe toddler and we start the bedtime routine. A few shenanigans, couple story books, and a meltdown later, we're ready.

**9:00pm**: Toddler goes to bed, and A and I chat a bit about finances.

**10:15pm**: Lights out! I'm exhausted!

**üåø DAILY TOTAL: $100**

‚ú®¬†**DAY 3: MONDAY**‚ú®

**6:50 am:**¬†Toddler wakes up crying again. Before he can open his eyes, he's crying to go outside. Child, please. Inside has a warm bed and sleep. Outside has cold.

**7:05 am:**¬†Of course the toddler wins. I get out of the bed, use the restroom, brush my teeth, and put on workout clothes. Toddler chews on his toothbrush.

**7:30am:**¬†I change toddler out of his nighttime clothes and get him ready for daycare. He's hungry too. We go to the kitchen where I make my protein coffee, and I make a PB toast for toddler. I add some berries and nuts. He's happy now. He asks me if trainer is coming. Kiddo likes our trainer.

**8:15 am:**¬†I strap toddler in and drop him off at daycare.

**8:30 am:**¬†Trainer comes. On Monday's I train with my neighbor who's also a mom (NM - Neighbor Mom) and pretty cool person to hangout. Trainer is helping me work towards a fully unassisted pull up by the end of the year. NM and I chat about our jobs. She tells me that they're talking about submitting her promo packet, but that there's talk of layoff at the same time.

**9:50 am**: It's supposed to be an hour long workout session but it usually bleeds into the next hour with stretches and small talk. Coach asks me about my quality of sleep, and nutrition. I tell him sleep has been mostly okay. We talk a little about my food choices. He says he doesn't want me to restrict too hard even if I can control my will. I once decided to drop calories to 1200 all of a sudden (from probably 2k?) and I cut out virtually all sugar. Within 24hours, I had brain fog that rivaled pregnancy. Trainer pointed out that it's likely the sudden removal of sugar that my brain has come to rely on. This would be totally ok on normal days, but with an intense job, I can't afford to be zoned out.

**10:00 am:**¬†I sit down at my desk with a protine smoothie. I'm upgrading some of the older pipelines, and adding monitoring to a few newer ones. My charter changed completely, and now I'm suddenly babysitting other people's work. Not loving it so far!

**10:30 am**: I see a ""weekly list"" from my manager. I can't believe she sends me these, but so far, I'm keeping my mouth shut. I roll my eyes at some of the things on the list but reply to her in the most neutral, almost positive tone I can muster, to essentially tell her I've got it - leave me to it. But it's becoming increasingly clear that in order to climb up from this point, I'm going to need to learn to manage up and do it well. She's brought up the fact that I'm ""too technical"" when dealing with people outside our team. I think I also need to learn to go back to basics and remind myself why certain metrics make sense and why certain don't while making sure I'm not accidentally glossing over anything.

**12:00 pm**: Some more banging my head on the wall - why is the refresh not working? Data seems correct, I don't see anything wrong with the pipeline but why is it complaining about the data? I send a msg on the right slack group with the details. The oncall person would've hopefully seen this before.

**12:23 pm**: I switch to a different task. This one seems more straight forward, but I can't test this locally so while I understand what I'm conceptually trying to achieve, I'm flying a bit blind here.

**12:30 pm**: I'm not hungry right now, but I usually take a break around this time. I grab the Oikos yogurt and top it off with some cereal. It's a high protine snack and it should last me until early evening.

**1:00 pm**: A colleague who owns one of the pipelines I'm struggling with, sends me a bunch of instructions that I can't decipher. I ask him some clarifications but he says he'll have time in a bit and can meet with me then. Sounds good.

**4:30 pm**: He's able to help me setup the environment locally and I can finally test some of the work before I push it to cloud. I create a PR with what I have, and close my laptop for the day. I'm going to take a little bit of a break now before I pick up my toddler. I also eat an early dinner - roasted tofu, guac, spicy honey, (leftovers from yesterday) and quinoa bowl.

**5:15 pm:**¬†We're back home. Toddler usually comes home hungry, so he usually eats early. It's the same ingredients as mine - quinoa, mushed tofu, different sauces, and smashed avocado. All three of us sit at the table while he eats. A and I try to have a conversation but that doesn't happen.

**6:00 pm**: I ask toddler if he wants to go to the neighbor's house. He's usually happy to go there - they have an elementary aged kid and he follows her around everywhere. I also enjoy the parent's company so it's a win-win.

**7:30 pm**: Toddler has another dinner with them (spaghetti with meat) and we come home.

**8:00 pm**: We begin the nighttime routine for toddler - bath, brush, stories and then off to fairly land.

**9:15 pm**: I come out of the bedroom after putting toddler to sleep. A has already cleaned up dinner, and loaded the dishwasher.

**10:00 pm:**¬†Lights out!

**üåø DAILY TOTAL: $0**

‚ú®¬†**DAY 4: TUESDAY**¬†‚ú®

**7:20am**: Toddler wakes up happy.

**7:30 am:**¬†I start getting ready for work. Toddler is toddling in the bedroom and A is trying to get some more shut eye.

**8:15 am:**¬†I'm ready for work, and I get toddler ready as well. He usually eats a small breakfast - a banana, or a toast, or one egg omelet if I have the energy for stove.

**8:30 am:**¬†We're out the door; drop toddler off at daycare in time for breakfast; and I head home again to login to work. I could drive to work right now, but it's peak traffic and I'll spend 2x more time on the road.

**10:00 am**: I start driving to work. I listen to Lenny's Podcast and I've been listening to technical leaders from OpenAI and Anthropic recently. A lot of what they're saying is BS probably, but they're passionate about their jobs - now when there's billions to be had, who wouldn't be. But to my ear, it sounds like it's about more than money. It's fascinating and I daydream about working at a place where people believe in the core mission of their jobs. Silicon Valley used to pretend to be mission based a while back - now that facade has dropped. It's more honest, but it's jarring that no one even mentions the greater good at all.

**10:30 am:**¬†I reach work. I go to the office cafe to grab an iced coffee. It's full of sugar, empty calories, and extremely delicious. I always get it with extra ice. Someone has reached back out with some options on the refresh issue. I start digging through the code pieces they sent me. I still don't see what's causing the error but at least I know where to being logging.

**1:30 pm**: I don't love the lunch options here so I bring with myself some snacks and protine shake. I usually don't feel ""hungry"" mid-day but more mentally need a break at this time. So I step away and take a walk around the campus. I listen to some music.

**4:30 pm:**¬†I can't really make much progress today. I start the drive back, pick toddler up on the way and head home.

**5:00 pm**: I reach home, and kick off a few runs with the newly merged PR. I fully expect these to fail as well because there's no reason these would work.

**5:15 pm**: Every Tuesday, me and the same family with two girls (from weekend) get together at a local park for a picnic. This is more a garden, less a park - usually empty and with good tree cover. So we meet up with some sandwiches. I tell me toddler that O and C (the girls) are on the way. He tells me he wants them to be here right now, and not to be on the way. O's dad texts back that they're one minute away. They usually pick up the sandwiches from a deli by their house. Our share is **$40.54**

At the picnic, toddler tells me he needs to pee. We find a bathroom but it's too gross. I ask C's help again. Does she need to go? She once again proudly shows off how she's able to go and LO follows her lead. I don't know if we'll resort to public defecation or what, if C's not around and we're outside but that's a problem for another day.

**7:30 pm**: LO ate half a sandwich but their toddler (C) didn't eat much. O is a 8mo baby and she munched on some berries. We call it a night and start packing up.

**8:00 pm**: Bathtime. Storytime and bedtime. A does the bath today.

**9:00 pm**: A reads the story to him and then ducks out. Toddler was tired today. Zonked out pretty quickly. A has cleaned up per usual, and loaded the dishwasher.

I log back in, yeah the runs failed. Okay, will go back tomorrow with this.

**10:00 pm**: I open Ramit's journal. I'm still working through it. I'm finding especially valuable to do the ""ideal day"" exercise over and over: what I used to consider my ideal day when LO was a baby is now often just my regular weekend. It helps me ground myself and feel some sense of gratitude.

**üåø DAILY TOTAL: $40.54**

‚ú®¬†**DAY 5: WEDNESDAY**¬†‚ú®

**7:20 am:**¬†My alarm goes off. Personal Trainer will be here at 8. Toddler is peacefully sleeping in the crib. I want to go kiss his cute face a few times without having him wake up.

**7:40 am**: I waddle out of the bed, brush my teeth, use the bathroom and quietly escape out.

**8:30 am**: Trainer comes, I do assisted pull-ups. I also do push-ups. I notice that I'm now able to do ten push-ups much easier than I was able to this time last year. I hear toddler wake up just minutes after I step into the garage, so I tell A that I can watch toddler while he drinks his coffee and freshens up.

He loves my trainer, and he loves being in the garage. Trainer just has to make sure to keep him away from weights, LO counts my reps and gets a positive view of exercise. LO is eating yogurt and bananas.

**9:45 am:**¬†I come inside. A says he'll drop toddler off. Phew thanks!

**10:00 am**: I bring my workout smoothie to my desk and login. I'm working on a proposal which should make our pipelines more standardized. Hopefully. ChatGPT tries to help. I have to ask leading questions but it does save me time from needing to read technical documentation to figure out exact details. But I am not worried about it coming for my job anytime soon. It does however, save me time. Before I finalize on the path forward, I will have to actually read that path's tech docs to make sure ChatGPT didn't miss things, but it is saving me from having to read multiple.

**12:30 pm:**¬†I do the Oikos yogurt and cereal again for right now - not super hungry.

**5:15 pm**: I pick up toddler. A preps rice and lentils in instant pot - that's dinner for all of us.

**6:00 pm**: Toddler eats with A. They're done. Toddler and I go over to NM's place and hang out with their family for an hour. Toddler eats a second dinner with their daughter. NM and I hang out often enough now that there's a quiet social contract - we don't feel the pressure to serve each other - I take care of the stove at her place if needed, bottle feed their baby if needed, or watch their daughter with our son. Occasionally NM and I can sit and chat while the kids chill by themselves. I ask her by when we absolutely need to be out of the house. She says 7:20pm.

**7:00 pm:**¬†I tell my kid that we have to leave in a few mins, and if he can help clean up the toys. Both of them begin cleaning up with a lot of ""I don't know how"" in between. At this age, it's a lot of very direct instructions: You see the orange truck? Pick it up. Now put it on the shelf next to the blue truck. etc. It's far easier to pick it up yourself, but on the days I have time, I try to instruct him to clean up himself.

**7:15 pm**: We come home.

**8:30 pm**: LO ate a little more with us. Shower, story and now in the crib.

**9:15 pm**: He's out.

**10:30 pm**: We are planning to throw a halloween party this year as well. A and I talk about theme ideas.

‚ú®¬†**DAY 6: THURSDAY**¬†‚ú®

**7:00 am:**¬†Toddler wakes up happy. He's whispering something about his daycare and his toys. I think I hear him say something about mom and dad. I think he's the cutest person I've ever met.

**8:30 am:**¬†I drop off toddler in time for a breakfast at the daycare today.

**9:30 am:**¬†I reach the office. Manager tells me that one of the newer artifacts that my team developed doesn't seem to have great precision. She tells me there's push back with a proposal I don't agree with. I don't think this is the best idea so I try to get more context on where this push back is coming from.

**12:30 pm**: Last week, a vendor changed data files unexpectedly, and things began failing. Since the charter changed, and all of this became my head-ache, I worked late one evening with a colleague and fixed the problem. Working late is fairly normal, but shining visibility on it isn't. My manager is new, and told me she wants to take me to lunch to thank me.

So we went for lunch to a very fancy place. Company paid the bill. I connected with her at a bit more personal level. She's not technical, but she's hard working and doing a masters right now. Brand new information, and massive respect!

**5:30 pm:** I reach home with the toddler. A tries and fails to get LO to sit on the dining table. A gives up, and feeds LO in the garage. LO is playing with a skateboard and our diving fins! One day, you'll be a diver like mom and dad. And I hope you enjoy the ocean just as much as we do!

Ordinarily, I go to a pilates class every Thrusday but I'm meeting a friend and driving down south for another Garba night! I'm excited this time. I've heard this artist's songs. We've paid for the tix already (**$37**) and apparently there's free parking on site. Parking on site was not free. We parked at a nearby hotel. **$20**

A will watch the toddler but since the weekend, A has been feeling a lot of congestion and possible flu like symptoms. Toddler recovered from something similar over the weekend. Ugh! I ask A if he's okay if I leave - he says that yes, it'll be hard but he'll manage using the TV and snacks. Okay, great!

**6:45 pm:** So much traffic as we get closer to the venue. I knew this guy was popular, I didn't realize just how much. We finally make it inside the venue and look for her friends. We do the garba and I realize that I can keep dancing for much longer stretches of time than last year. My friend and a new friend comment on the fact that I seem to enjoy this a lot, and that I have a lot of stamina. It's not just that I enjoy it, it's that I've been working out for years. I get a lot more pleasure from that compliment than anything about being in a smaller body!!

**8:30 pm**: She tells me her husband has been sick, and their toddler is with his mom and toddler is unhappy. She also shows me husband's photos to their landlord - leak in the kitchen! We both comment that it's so hard to leave the house even once a year without feeling guilty. Noteworthy is the fact that neither her husband nor A told us to cancel the plan or come back etc. We feel it anyway but as of this moment, while we're indulging in our hobbies, our toddlers are unhappy/melting down/not getting best care.

We begin driving back, and decide to stop on the way to taco bell. **$15**

**7:00 am:**¬†Toddler wakes up, and wakes me up.

**8:30 am:**¬†I dropped toddler off with a small box of grapes. Trainer comes and I tell him that I went for garba this year too. And unlike last year, it didn't fuck up my knees! I'm happy.

**10:30am**: I shower, and drive to work. The traffic is light on Fridays and driving is easier. I listen to some music on the way.

**11:00am**: The failing refresh from earlier in the week are working finally. I look at the performance. It's pretty shit but that's expected. So far, I've only gotten the setup up and running. Now begins the hard work of actually getting it to make sense.

**4:00pm**: I start driving back.

**5:30 pm:**¬†I pick up the toddler and make it home. We have some family in Bay Area, one of A's cousin has a baby and we've not been able to meet as often as we'd like. We've invited them over for dinner tonight.

**6:30 pm**: They arrive. I want toddler to have roots here. It won't be to the extent that I had growing up where you live next to the same people for generations. But I also don't want him to feel like tumbleweed as he grows up. So I try very hard to reach out and have meaningful social connections in my life that I hope will eventually extend into his.

**10:00 pm:**¬†Toddler went to sleep, and I open Ramit's journal again. I'm working through the last few chapters where he challenges you to dream big over a ten year period. It feels overwhelming.

1. Until I began writing this and comparing notes from last year, I didn't fully appreciate just how far I've come in terms of postpartum recovery!
2. H1B news lately has been very unsettling. I don't know what will come of it, and I don't know how it will impact my life. I can only hope that we'll have a little time to wrap up, leave if it comes to that.
3. We're away from family, and we want our son to know that there will always be people in his life that love him, and care for him. We want our friends kids to think of us the same way. But this kind of depth of bond won't happen if we meet someone just once every few months. This sort of bond only happens with people you meet regularly - like multiple times a week. It's effort to get up, and take our son for a picnic or to neighbor's house rather than just vegetating in our own backyard, but I think it's worth it. And clearly the parents around us share the same mindset.",3,1758845780.0,MoneyDiariesACTIVE,1,0.71,False

After my last relationship, I kept myself busy with work. Living alone and traveling to different areas of the US (work), I really learned to love myself. I slowly understood what it meant to be happy when you are alone. It got to the point where I even told myself that I was okay with never finding love. 

I have Grindr on my phone, I rarely use it unless I‚Äôm bored looking to exchange pictures. A couple of weeks ago, I started chatting with this guy and enjoyed our conversation. I gave him my number and we texted for about a week. He suggested meeting up at his place to watch some movies and cuddle. A piece of me was excited to meet a guy and genuinely get to know him. Another piece of me was screaming stop, you‚Äôre happy being alone DON‚ÄôT FUCK THIS UP. The day comes and we meet each other. He‚Äôs more handsome in person, he has a funny personality, and we just clicked. I was awkward and nervous and could tell that he was nervous as well. Before we started the movie, we shared life experiences/childhood memories. He picked a movie and we ate pizza then cuddled while watching the movie. It got late and we both had been drinking. I don‚Äôt remember who asked about staying the night, but I was fine with it. We both hop into bed and pass out. The following morning was fantastic. We drank coffee and just talked about random stuff/jokes back and forth. I ended up leaving early because I have to let my dog out and make sure he‚Äôs okay. We texted a good bit during the beginning of the week, but our texting starts to dwindle as Friday approaches. Instead of joking back and forth, the conversation has started to die. I have a gut feeling he is no longer interested. I do not want to push or keep texting him to where he thinks I‚Äôm some crazy desperate guy. I don‚Äôt think it helps that I have severe OCD/anxiety. 

I start playing these scenarios in my head that I fucked up. I should have never went over there. I should have never opened up about myself. Did this happen because of my body (I don‚Äôt a six pack/defined muscles)? Did I do something wrong and fuck this up? I hate it. I feel like a fool for going against my other self thinking something could have come from this. Before this, I would have never gave a damn about what anyone thought of me.

1nqmx9i,https://www.reddit.com/r/Concussion/comments/1nqmx9i/im_getting_scared_now/,I‚Äôm getting scared now,"So it‚Äôs been about a month and a week since i‚Äôve hit my head, it was on the 18th of last month.

Basically I was leaning down at work and forgot there was a metal tray above my head. I whipped up fast, and smashed my head.

My job is very punitive with sick absences, and in the past I‚Äôve freaked out over health scares that turned out to be nothing, so I (very stupidly) jumped back into work after a day off, thinking it was nothing and I was just freaking out for no reason.

Well, I felt like crap after I finished out my work trip, and realized it was a legit injury, and I needed rest. I took a few days to rest, and visited the doctor, who basically treated me like I was crazy. I kinda get where she was coming from, because I do have mental health problems (anxiety, ocd), but yeah.

She ordered a CT scan for me, which of course, showed nothing. She (very hesitantly due to my mental health history) diagnosed me with a concussion, due to my symptoms, but told me everything would be fine, and I‚Äôd be set to go back to work soon.

But the weeks passed with me doing seemingly everything right. Taking time off work to rest at home, taking turmeric and omega 3-6-9 every morning and night, sleeping enough every night, making sure i eat brain rich foods, taking creatine every morning, drinking green tea, cutting out alcohol and coffee, getting good exercise everyday, I recently started doing neck and vestibular youtube videos, I‚Äôve been getting acupuncture done every week, etc.

I tried not to worry too much at first, because I knew it was gonna make me feel worse, and it was still the early stages. This is my 2nd concussion (I had one in college), so as well as with jumping into work, I figured it would take a bit more time to heal than my first, which took about 2 weeks.

However, I‚Äôm still feeling bad, and with a month passed, and a few doctor‚Äôs appointments still reporting the same symptoms, my doctor believes me now. She referred me to a physical therapist, which I‚Äôm starting soon, so I‚Äôm really hoping and praying it helps.

I had an on and off again headache the first week that went away, so that gives me hope that it‚Äôs healing, but very slowly. My neck hurts (which I think has been helped a bit by acupuncture since I‚Äôve started), but the main thing is my brain fog. It SUCKS. I don‚Äôt feel like myself, my short-term memory is crap, and my focus is shot.

I actually do think my cognitive problems are coming from my neck at this point.

But I really am just tired of feeling like this, and I‚Äôm so scared this is gonna be a permanent issue. I see other‚Äôs stories of how they suffer years with symptoms, and I‚Äôm terrified as I‚Äôm past the 4 week mark.

I‚Äôm on my work‚Äôs temporary leave, but I‚Äôve just constantly been thinking of what will happen if I can‚Äôt go back to work. I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôll be fired if I don‚Äôt go back soon.",2,1758845511.0,Concussion,1,1.0,False

The champagne flute slipped from my fingers, crystal shattering against the marble floor of our penthouse living room. The sound echoed through the silence, but I couldn't tear my eyes away from my phone screen.

There it was. Posted just twenty minutes ago on Giselle Marshall's Instagram account‚Äîa photograph that made my blood turn to ice. A marriage certificate. Spencer Tucker and Giselle Marshall. Dated exactly five years ago.

The same date as my wedding.

My hands trembled as I zoomed in on the image, desperate to find some sign it was fake, some indication this was another one of Giselle's cruel games. But the seal looked authentic. The signatures were clear. Spencer's handwriting‚ÄîI knew it as well as my own.

The caption beneath the photo was simple, devastating: ""Five beautiful years with my husband. Some things are worth waiting for. #TrueLove #MarriedLife #SeattleLife""

I stumbled backward, my legs hitting the edge of our cream leather sofa. Our sofa. Our home. Our life. Everything I'd believed was real, everything I'd built my identity around for five years, suddenly felt as fragile as the shattered glass at my feet.

With shaking fingers, I scrolled through Giselle's other recent posts. There were dozens I'd somehow missed‚Äîphotos of her and Spencer at restaurants I recognized, shopping trips to stores where I thought only I accompanied him, intimate dinners where his hand covered hers across candlelit tables. How had I been so blind?

The worst part wasn't even the betrayal itself. It was the dates. Every single romantic photo with Spencer was timestamped during our marriage. While I was home, planning our anniversary dinners, choosing curtains for our bedroom, believing I was the luckiest woman in Seattle‚Äîhe was with her.

I ran to our bedroom, my bare feet silent on the hardwood floors. My wedding album sat on the dresser, pristine white leather embossed with gold lettering: ""Mr. and Mrs. Tucker."" I flipped it open with desperate hands, searching for my marriage certificate tucked safely in the back pocket.

There it was. Same date as Giselle's. Same officiant signature. Same everything‚Äîexcept the bride's name.

My certificate looked identical to hers in every way. But if hers was real...

The realization hit me like a physical blow. I sank onto the edge of our king-sized bed, the marriage certificate trembling in my grip. If Giselle's marriage was legal, then mine was nothing. A performance. A lie wrapped in white silk and promises that meant nothing.

Footsteps echoed in the hallway. Spencer was home.

""Isabelle? I heard something break‚Äî"" His voice cut off as he appeared in the doorway, taking in my tear-stained face and the papers scattered around me.

I held up both marriage certificates, my voice barely a whisper. ""Which one is real, Spencer?""

The color drained from his face. For a moment, he looked like a stranger‚Äîthis man I'd shared a bed with for five years, whose coffee I made every morning, whose shirts I pressed for important meetings. The silence stretched between us, heavy with the weight of unspoken truths.

""Isabelle, I can explain‚Äî""

""Which. One. Is. Real?"" Each word came out sharp, cutting through whatever excuse he was preparing.

His shoulders sagged in defeat. ""Both. Neither. It's complicated.""

""Complicated?"" I stood up, fury replacing the numbness that had consumed me moments before. ""Complicated is choosing between two restaurants for dinner. Complicated is not knowing whether your wife of five years is actually your wife!""

Spencer stepped into the room, his hands raised as if approaching a wounded animal. ""Please, let me explain. Sit down, and I'll tell you everything.""

""I've been sitting for five years, Spencer. Sitting in this house, in this marriage, in this life that apparently doesn't even belong to me."" I waved Giselle's marriage certificate in the air. ""She posted this today. Today, Spencer. Do you know what that means?""

His face crumpled. ""She wasn't supposed to‚Äî""

""She wasn't supposed to what? Tell the truth? Let everyone know she's been legally married to my husband while I've been playing house with someone else's?""

The words hung in the air between us, sharp and irreversible. Spencer's mouth opened and closed, but no sound came out. For the first time in our relationship, the man who always had an answer, who always knew how to fix things, looked completely lost.

I walked past him toward his study, both marriage certificates clutched in my fists. ""We're going to sit down, and you're going to tell me everything. No lies, no protection, no complicated explanations. Just the truth.""

Behind me, I heard him whisper, ""The truth might destroy us.""

I paused at the doorway, not turning around. ""Spencer, we're already destroyed. I just didn't know it until twenty minutes ago.""",1,1758845358.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

I'm 35F with PCOS and insulin resistance. I've always been overweight, even as a kid, it's just a matter of¬†*how*¬†overweight. I've tried a variety of diets before and the only one I ever saw any results with was keto. Years ago I was on the diet for around 2 years and lost maybe 30-40 pounds. My husband suddenly was hospitalized for heart issues and the next few years I was off-diet, often stress eating, as I was more focused on managing his health and mentally surviving. Now that things are better I've been addressing my own health again. I'm heavier than I've ever been, so three months ago I decided to go full dedicated keto again.

Unfortunately, things are not going as well as they did years ago when I was on the diet. I've only lost 2-3 pounds on a good day. Slow progress wouldn't bother me so much, but I'm also sick way more often than when I did keto previously. I'm frequently constipated, gassy, nauseated, and in pain. I almost never had these issues when I did keto years ago.

For context, I do not have my gall bladder anymore, but it was taken out years before I started my first round of the keto diet. I take enzyme supplements and probiotics.

I guess I'd like some advice on if there is something really obvious I'm doing incorrectly? I'm not sure I can keep it up if I'm going to be sick multiple times a week.

Mornings I typically eat ratio trio yogurt with chia seeds, an IQ bar, and coffee with MCT oils.  
Lunches (if I have them) are tuna sandwiches on keto bread with avocado oil mayo and tuna in olive oil, a cheese stick, and a fat bomb.  
Dinner ranges from fish or chicken with green beans, Caesar salad (no croutons) with bacon, or scrambled eggs with cheese.

I drink as much water as I can, but I'm a teacher so during the work week I can only have so much because I can't use the restroom frequently.

A few days pass and he texts me asking to get drinks but the # is Arizona area code. My friend who literally saw us talking told me to just google his #. Nothing really came up, but she said him going in for a hug after and just doing that maybe means he does this a lot. Idk how to place his age, I didn‚Äôt reply yet. What do you all think?

I'm into blue collar dudes who can banter and generally believe in working class solidarity, women's rights (and wrongs).

1nqmk7y,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1nqmk7y/exwife_from_hell/,Ex-Wife from HELL!,"Not an AITA story but we would like to share.¬†¬†

Hello wonderful fellow potatoes. This is going to be a long one, so please bear with me. I will try and make it as clear as possible.¬† I (F36), and my Fiance (M44) have been together just under 2 years. Fiance has a son (M7) and a daughter (F17) with his ex-wife, son is his biological child, daughter is not but he has raised her as his own but has no parental rights (this is important for context later on), I have 2 kids as well F9 and M20. We are also both in the military, ex-wife is not.¬†

Our relationship began after he and his ex-wife separated and were living apart. I want to reiterate that I am not an affair partner, if they were happily married and living together, I would have never came between them, but my Fianc√© and I believe we did this the right way. Moving on, when we first met, we did not intend on having a full-fledged relationship but after our first date (early 2024), we just knew that this was for us, and we decided to make it official. Fast forward a couple of months and we decide to introduce each other to our children, and the kids hit it off and get along quite well. His daughter and I got along and even spent time alone together, which I thought was great. Over the next few months, I still had not met the ex-wife and when we finally met, she was very cold and unapproachable. She was also upset with my fianc√© because he did not introduce me to her prior to involving the children and we both agreed that she was right about that and he apologized, but she did not care for the apology.¬†

Moving on, I had to deploy at the end of 2024 and returned home mid 2025. During my time on deployment, things were going well, some issues came up between him and his ex-wife but they would resolve themselves. In Nov 2024 we had a scheduled stop in France and my Fiance (boyfriend at the time) flew out to see me and that is where he proposed, in Saint-Tropez, my dream vacation spot. With the engagement, also came the decision to purchase a new home for our blended family which we closed on right before my return from deployment (YAY). I should add, my deployment was extended a few times, which caused my absence from the closing of our home. We made the decision to keep this to ourselves until I returned home and then inform our friends and family, which included his ex-wife (out of courtesy). After discussing, my Fianc√© decided he needed to tell his e-wife that him and I would be moving in together and that he had proposed to me and we were now engaged. My fianc√© went to her house when he was dropping off their son and told her he had to speak to her about a few things. He proceeded to tell her that we were moving in together and she became infuriated and shut the door in his face, which didn‚Äôt allow for him to also inform her that we were also engaged. I said, well you did your part, if she is going to be a b\*tch about it, then that‚Äôs on her.¬†¬†

Fast forward a month or so after my return, we take a family trip and my Fiance‚Äôs son takes a few pictures of the family on his phone. Nothing major, just pictures of the family trip. When he goes back to his mom‚Äôs house, she see‚Äôs the pictures and notices a ring on my finger and asks her daughter if she knows about the ring and her daughter says yes, dad told me about it a few months ago. Ex-wife then decides to message my fianc√© and states that they need to talk so they agree to meet at a local coffee shop to talk. When they both arrive, she immediately goes off and throws a fit about the ring and why she didn‚Äôt know and did not even let my Fianc√© explain before she stormed out of the shop. Again, he did his part to try and explain things to her, although he is not required to do so, but her attitude does not allow for it.¬†

With all this going on there are messages being sent back and forth between the ex-wife and my Fianc√© where she continues to bash him for being an ‚Äúabsent‚Äù father because he was gone a lot of the time due to the military (nature of the job, she knew what she was marrying into) and also stating he abandoned his daughter, that he doesn‚Äôt provide for her and that he basically just doesn‚Äôt care for her (his daughter now lives with her biological father who is 2 hours away from us, but we visit when possible and my Fianc√© is always talking to her on the phone and staying in contact). I tell him that he has done all he can for both his kids and that it is not fair for her to say the things she says about him when he did so much for their daughter when they were together and he continues to do what he can but ultimately he is not legally responsible for her and she( ex-wife) cannot pick and choose when he is dad and when he is not, that is completely unfair to him IMO.¬†

We move on and continue living our lives, then the ex-wife makes a decision to involve their son in scouts, which includes a ton of outdoor activities, my Fiance was 100% onboard and they make an agreement about alternating activities, specifically camping. They both agreed to each take him camping on their respective weekends. The first camping trip comes up and the ex-wife is responsible for taking him but a couple of days prior she decides that she simply cannot go tent camping because she isnt comfortable sleeping in a tent, and insists that my fianc√© take their son because she cannot and he should change his plans to accommodate her discomfort with camping. He reminds her that they agreed to alternate camping trips and she states she will not do it and if he doesn‚Äôt accompany their son, then he will just have to miss the trip. They go back and forth a bit, she assumes his plans are with me and begins to state that once again I am being prioritized when that is not the case, he had plans with friends which he had made months in advance. She also makes a statement along the lines of ‚Äúsometimes parents need to change their plans for their kids‚Äù, so my Fianc√© proceeds to tell her that sometimes parents need to step out of their comfort zones for their children as well, referring to her not being comfortable with camping. He sets a firm boundary and says no, he will be sticking to the agreement of alternating the camping trips, and reminds her camping is not mandated and she is able to attend with her son without spending the night, but she refused to attend the event, which leads to their son having to miss his first camping trip.¬†

Later that very same day his son messages him and requests that his mother (ex-wife) accompanies us on Halloween. Fianc√© and I talked about it and we both feel this request from his son is an idea that came from his mom and not him. We say and think this because it has not been something that his son has brought up before and it was just too much of a coincidence. We believe she is trying to pull a fast one and will try to separate from the group while trick or treating and will force my Fianc√© to pick who he goes with, driving a wedge not only between us but between him and his son because he would have to choose between the two, going with his son and ex-wife or staying with me and my daughter. This is just a speculation coming from prior experience.¬†

I expressed my concerns to my fianc√© with all of this and he has decided that he is going to tell his son that we will be spending Halloween together (Fiance, myself, both kiddos) and that ex-wife can join us next year because this is our first year spending the holiday together, with hopes that his son will understand.¬†

We have also agreed to have a conversation with the ex-wife, no kids around and discuss hard set boundaries, explaining that their time has come and gone and he is now in a new relationship, and his priority will always be his son, and he no longer is inclined to accommodate her. That she will have to learn to accept that his family is now his son, myself and my children and that she will always be his mother and we will always respect that, but she needs to be respectful towards us and our family or we will go LC and will not include her if she cannot agree to these terms.¬†

So I went to the corner store to buy a lighter, after I bought it I was walking to my car and then this lady approaches me who we will refer to as ""Woman 1"" and asked if I could buy her a coffee so I was ""Eh, sure why not, call it my good deed for today"". After she comes in the store with me I buy the coffee and while I'm purchasing it the two store owners were saying ""You don't have to get it"" and I didn't think much of it and told them that I was fine with buying it so while I was buying it some random lady comes in the store who we will refer to as ""Woman 2""and punches Woman 1 in the face right in front of me lmao! She starts cursing her out talking about ""Bitch I told yo ass to not come back around here"" and she hits her in the face again! Woman 1 says ""No wait I actually know this guy he was just helping me"" and that's when I decided to leave because it wasn't my place. After I walked out Woman 2 confronted me cursing me out for helping Woman 1 and I'm over her like ""I don't know who this woman is!"" But she wasn't hearing it, she was mad! So mad that I was afraid she was going to hit me (Judging by her movements it looked like she was going to) lol so while this is going on Woman 1 tries to get in my car!

That right hook was so clean that it nearly knocked Woman 1 out! Wig came off and everything and while she's on the ground she's getting stomped out!

Anyway, it feels more humid here. It‚Äôs a pleasant, laidback and damn hilly city. There‚Äôs the occasional coffee shop or other place that‚Äôs clearly aimed at tourists, but it‚Äôs nowhere near as bad as Envigado or El Poblado.

One of the many, many things I love about being in Colombia is that I don‚Äôt stick out. At least until I open my mouth. I‚Äôm mixed English and South East Asian and definitely stick out in the UK, with the occasional accompanying racism. Here though, that and the fact that my skin tans really easily results in what I like to call tourist camouflage. Airbnb hosts have often assumed that I‚Äôm from Argentina, for example. Again, until I speak.

Today‚Äôs incident was extremely brief, but felt like a win.

I always get treated like a Latino in supermarkets until I‚Äôm asked for my zone ID number, at which point they know I‚Äôm a foreigner. This is especially funny when white tourists are in front of me in a queue; the checkout person‚Äôs vibe is completely different with me.

Anyway, I was paying in D1 - the biggest discount supermarket chain - and was asked if I was a foreigner as my card was going through. I‚Äôd already said that I wanted a bag and that I wanted to pay by card. That‚Äôs normally enough speaking for locals to know I‚Äôm not one of them. Presumably the card shows as international on the employee‚Äôs screen.

Maybe the woman at the checkout was just tired or having a brain fart. Regardless, I took it as a tiny win and a compliment.

I‚Äôm here until the 30th, then it‚Äôs back to the capital. My sister will arrive early on the 1st and we‚Äôll be off to Ca√±o Cristales a couple of days later. I‚Äôll be an interpreter with no English speaking guide. Followed by 4 days in The Amazon, with no English speaking guide and no internet. That should be more challenging. 

My sister speaks no Spanish whatsoever and has never been to Latin America. So I‚Äôll be her interpreter and guide to all things related to the language, the continent and Colombia‚Äôs culture. I hope that I don‚Äôt screw up toooo badly. This is my third visit to the country and this trip will take me up to about 9 months in Colombia overall.

1nqmgie,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nqmgie,Today's morning routine (and yesterday's PM one),"I've been wanting to share some opinions on some of the products I use for a while but I have a hard time taking good pics, so haven't had the courage until today. And now here I go!

I must say too that I'm 43, and I have combination/normal skin with a tendency to get a couple of pimples when I'm getting my period. 

* Cleanser AM: G&G Jelly Joker. I haven't been using it for very long but I like it so far. At first the thick consistency and the fact that it doesn't foam threw me off, but it's gentle and it doesn't sting my eyes. 

PM: Tomorrow Labs HSF MED Sensitive Face Wash. I don't have much left of this which is a pity because I like it a lot. Is gentle, foams lightly, rinses easily, it doesn't sting my eyes and I love the feeling it leaves on my face when rinsed. But fair warning, it was pricey and you only can get it in some outlets in some countries as it seems the brand went (rightfully) out of business. 

* Eye treatment AM: Singuladerm Xpert Contour. I have hooded eyes and that causes me feeling the area congested very often, so I can't live without an eye product that helps me with that. Coincidentally I also have a huge tendency to develop milia in the eye area so I've learnt to avoid more oclusive formulas. This I got in a buy 2 pay 1 deal in a fluke and turns out is great as it's a blue gel with a slight firming and draining effect. Since I'm using it I also had some of my milia disappear, which can be a coincidence, but definitely a happy one. The INCI show that it's mainly some peptides. It seems the deal I got is because the brand has changed name and now is Primaderm.

PM: Kriim Caffeine Shot Serum. Caffeine has been my favourite ingredient for the eye area for a long while. But at first I used it mainly in the AM routine to try to fight the puffiness. Turned out that this product made my eye twitch mid morning after my third coffee. So decided to try it in my PM routine and has been a life savior. Now I just don't get that much puffiness. I also love the serum consistency and the 30ml last me a long time. Problem is this brand has also gone out of business and I don't know what I'm going to do when I run out...

* Actives AM: G&G C-Glow. I've been wanting to try this for a while and just started a week ago. So far I'm very happy as is a water like texture that isn't greasy, nor heavy. The only problem is that is kind of tricky to apply evenly to the whole face. I definitely would love some tips from the people who use it.

G&G Power Petides. This is the first day I use this after the C-Glow. I think I like the combo because it adds the slip the C-Glow doesn't add. I'll keep trying different things though to see what I like best. 

PM: G&G B-bomb + aPAD. Last year decided to skip the retinol and AHAs during the summer because I can't avoid not being super diligent reapplying sunscreen. I had a Azelaic + Niacinamide serum lying around I wanted to try and decided it was the best time. Turned out I loved it. I definitely get less oily and have a clearer skin. So this summer wanted to do the same but wasn't able to find that same serum, so ended up getting aPAD, used it on its own for a couple of weeks but felt something was missing so I also got B-bomb. I really love the combo. To the point I'm starting to wonder if it may work better for me than the retinol+AHA+BHA routines I use in the winter. 

* Moisturiser PM: Drunk Elephant Protini Polypeptide Cream. I love this stuff. Is pricey but I don't care because the day I use it I really can tell the next morning. My skin feels plumper, smooth, bright. 

* Sunscreen: Garnier Invisible Serum Super UV. The last two summers I only used this when I was going to the beach or the pool, or stuff like that. I really don't know why. I think that because when you push the pump and start applying does feel a little heavy, like it doesn't spread easily and then you get this shiny look until it sets. But this year I realised that when it sets it's actually less shiny than the Hyaluronic acid one I was using as a daily sunscreen and that it doesn't move around as much. So now I swapped one for the other.

He was THRILLED!,"I love going to garage sales. Half of the stuff I find isn‚Äôt even for me because I‚Äôll find something that is perfect for someone I know. I just enjoy going on my little treasure hunts, like retail therapy but at a much lower price point.

Case in point: I was rummaging around a sale and found a little something-something that I thought my colleague would like. He‚Äôs a collector of certain memorabilia and this find was exactly in that realm. EVERYONE at work knows he‚Äôs a collector, his office looks like a hobby store with a central theme. It was also just a little bit odd that I thought he might not have one yet. It was also not so significant that it would cost a ton of money at the store or that there could be a deeper meaning beneath its face value. It was only $1 so I snapped it up immediately. I‚Äôve bought colleagues cups of coffee that cost more than that. 

It sat in my car for several weeks because I didn‚Äôt quite know HOW to give it to him. We‚Äôre not superclose but we‚Äôve definitely got a solid working relationship, as there is occasional overlap between our separate departments. There are ZERO feelings on either side other than professional respect and courtesy (tbh I kind of sometimes think I‚Äôm ace, but that‚Äôs a story for another time). How do I give it to him and explain I got it because it made me think of him and I thought he‚Äôd like it without making it weird?

I was finally able to give it to him this week. His face lit up with a huge genuine smile and he exclaimed how cool he thought it was. He thanked me and that was it. I walked away feeling so good about the whole thing, partly because I was able to gift it in a way that DIDN‚ÄôT make it awkward.

I was a dedicated team leader with so much energy & drive. They abused me & destroyed it! Came in at 3 am to unload HV & deal with produce truck (not even my job) & sometimes 10 pallets of water from charts. Along with all the other laundry list of stuff. 

Most horrible shifts ever, and they never fixed it. Would open, close, & mid in the same week. I never enjoyed anything. Even my days off I was unhappy. Never felt rested, just felt like a zombie unless I was fresh off coffee. Instead of working with me, I was just told to sleep more. 

Stayed late to assist the store on busy weekends & ad change, then told I can‚Äôt have OT. No extra pay for all the sweaty effort I put in. This job was a fucking disgrace. Finally before an overnight, when I felt more dead than usual, I told em this is my last week here. 

I was nice & worked an extra day, my last horrible 3 AM shift, that they NEVER EVEN PAID ME FOR. No direct deposit, not even a paper check (I called the store). 

I am a positive, energetic person, but Publix ruined my life. Even after my new job, it took another week or so to reset my body & feel normal again. I hated that place. I feel like if you‚Äôre a capable hard worker, they just use you. Felt great getting this off my chest. ",6,1758843690.0,publix,3,1.0,False

Thus I documented every single penny that I spent on my vacation which I will share below.

**Initial Research and Planning:**

My trip to Japan was a bit spontaneous, I always wanted to go there but the planning itself wasn't that extensive, as I booked everything not even one week prior, however I did check for Flights and Accommodation here and there, for around 2-3 Weeks total.

For flights I used various websites and ended up going with **Google Flights** as it showed me some flights which weren't listed on Skyscanner, which to me seemed like the second best option.

I ended up booking Economy round trip tickets with Air China, both having a Layover in China, in Beijing and Shanghai Pudong on the return flight.

Layover was around 3h on the outbound flight, which was no problem at all, although security was a bit slow in Beijing, under 2h would have been risky.

On my return flight the Layover was **17-18 whole hours**, I'll just say this, it's **best to keep it under 10h** if you want to keep your sanity.

Before booking everything I always read about it being very important that you land in Haneda and not Narita Airport, both my Tickets were for **Narita Airport**, turned out that **it was absolutely no problem**.

**Total cost for the Round Trip Flights**:

* China Air Round Trip Tickets, FRA-NRT **approx. 600‚Ç¨** or **$700**

Now regarding Hotels, I really struggled because I just could not find something affordable, I checked on various websites, Agoda, Booking, Airbnb and it was just impossible to find something that wasn't either overly expensive, or a typical cheap Hostel.

Also on my list of Criteria, **good connection** such as being on the **Yamanote Line** or on a good and **accessible line**.

I do value Privacy a fair bit and having my own Bathroom but I have to mention that I am not rich, I am just a Student who had some money saved up for this trip but didn't want to waste it all, so I just went with the APA Hotel Chain, specifically **APA Hotel Komagome Ekimae.** (Yamanote Line)

For most Hotels, especially Hotel chains, it is important to mention that it is always cheaper when you book directly through their website, which is what I did.

Since the APA Hotel rate got a bit pricy near the end, I went with a second Hotel for the last 3 nights, specifically **Nine Hours Ningyoch≈ç.** (Hibiya-Line, Asakusa-Line)

**Total cost for Accommodation:**

* **Sept. 8-19 APA Hotel Komagome Ekimae approx. 600‚Ç¨, 103.900¬•**
* **Sept. 19-22 Nine Hours Ningyoch≈ç approx. 100‚Ç¨, 17.149¬•**

Since I also needed internet, I went with an eSim as it seemed easier than portable wifi or similar.

After some research I went with a Ubigi eSim.

**Total cost for eSim (Internet):**

50GB 20 day Plan, **50‚Ç¨** (ended up not even using 10GB)

Regarding my itinerary, I bookmarked a few places and restaurants that I would want to visit, however I never had a detailed plan or actual itinerary per se, and just did what I felt like doing most of the time.

**Budget:**

I had no actual Budget in mind and took approx. **700‚Ç¨ Cash** with me, however ended up **spending none of it**, as I only used my Credit Card and **99% of the time I used my** (Apple Wallet) **Suica Card**, which I topped using my Credit Card.

Below will be a list of every single day in detail and the spending.

**Day 1**

Landed at around 7PM, I arrived at the Hotel at around 09:30PM, grabbed some snacks from a Convenience Store and went to sleep.

Narita Airport Skyliner -> Nippori Station 2.580¬•

Almost made the mistake of entering the Skyliner after only scanning myself in using the Suica Card, for the Skyliner you **need reserved seats** (clearly says so on the Train itself), which I then ended up buying.

Nippori Station -> Komagome Station 146¬•

USB C Cable at Family Mart 1380¬•

Oi Ocha Green Tea, Melon Pan at Family Mart 268¬•

**Day 2**

*On the second day I initially wanted to go to Shibuya, however I was on the wrong side of the Platform when I entered the train and just went with it and decided to go to Akihabara, which was one of the places I wanted to visit anyway.*

Went to a few Book-Offs and similar stores there and just walked around mostly.

Komagome Station -> Okaichimachi Station 167¬•

McDonalds Bai Chicken Filet-O-Set Menu with McShake Muscat, McFloat Melon 1090¬•

*I was a bit overwhelmed by the city, it being my first time Solo Traveling and also first time in Japan, so I went with McDonalds, also because I was interested in the McFloat Melon, which on videos always looked nice.*

*Unsurprisingly, out of all the places I went to for dinner, this was probably* ***the worst one***\*, but it was not bad, it was just ""McDonalds good""\*.

Okaichimachi Station  -> Komagome Station 167¬•

Egg & Tuna Sando, Water 1L, Strawberry Cheesecake Mochi, Yakult 930¬•

*Since my Hotel had* ***no breakfast,*** *I always bought some stuff from Convenience Stores to either eat as small snack, but mostly just to serve as breakfast.*

Pocari Sweat from Vending machine 180¬•

**Day 3**

*On my third day I started going out early, to come back to the Hotel and chill a bit, take a shower and later go out again, (trying to go to a new part of the city this time) to have Dinner.*

***I followed this path for most of the following days*** *and really liked it, as this* ***guaranteed me*** *to see at least two different parts of Tokyo in one day.*

Komagome Station -> Shibuya Station 208¬•

Umbrella at Family Mart 2215¬•

*September in Japan isn't a joke, the Rain was sometimes intense, not possible without an Umbrella, but the weather itself was not as bad as some people claim.*

Don Qui Souvenirs 5987¬•

*Interestingly, a big chunk of my total cost was Souvenirs, however since I don't view them as necessity I think it should be noted that one can ignore this cost but I decided to leave them in regardless.*

Shibuya Station -> Komagome Station 208¬•

Komagome Station -> Kanda Station 178¬•

Burger, Fries with a Drink at JustA Burger near Nihonbashi 2050¬•

***One of the best Burgers*** *that I ate in my entire life, not really big portions, but very tasty and cool location.*

Kanda Station -> Komagome Station 178¬•

Tuna Onigiri, Lemon Drink at Family Mart 336¬•

**Day 4**

Shinjuku Station -> Komagome Station 178¬•

Lemon Honey Drink from Vending Machine 120¬•

Coco Ichibanya, Chicken Cutlet Curry & Iced Tea 1111¬•

*Since it was a bit late, I didn't want to take a train somewhere to have Dinner, so I walked to one* ***Coco Ichibanya*** *Restaurant which wasn't the closest, just to see a bit of Komagome (cool residential city), I walked for around 20min and had dinner there.*

*Easily* ***my favorite Chain Restaurant*** *in Japan, no wonder I ate there a total of 3 times, the food was so good and cozy, can't imagine how it would taste on a cold winter day.*

Melon Bread, Banana Custard Br√ªl√©e Crepe, Cookies & Creme Snoopy Sandwich, Oronamin C Drink, Iced Coffee at Family Mart 1283¬•

**Day 5**

Komagome Station -> Yurakucho Station 178¬•

*I am into Photography and there were so many interesting buildings in Tokyo that I wanted to visit and just see for myself, one of those was the* ***Tokyo International Forum***\*, I also went around and took a look at Ginza and some other parts close by.\*

Yurakucho Station -> Komagome Station 178¬•

Komagome Station -> Ikebukuro Station 167¬•

Yakiniku Like Beef Ribs & Skirt Steak Set, Cola 1600¬•

*As an introvert, those restaurants like Yakiniku Like really sparked my interest, the food was pretty good, although* ***I wasn't that full to be honest***\*, I kind of regretted not trying the Wagyu meats, really cool experience though in general, meat had a nice grill taste.\*

Ikebukuro Station -> Komagome Station 167¬•

1L Suntory Water, Custard Cream & Custard Cream Bread, Coolish Vanilla at Family Mart 478¬•

**Day 6**

Komagome Station -> Shinjuku Station 178¬•

Kiddyland Souvenirs 1980¬•

Shinjuku Station -> Komagome Station 178¬•

Komagome Station -> Okaichimachi Station 167¬•

Coco Ichibanya, Chicken Cutlet Curry & Cola 1226¬•

Kokaichimachi Station -> Komagome Station 167¬•

Soft Waffle, Tiramisu Doramocchi at Lawson 408¬•

**Day 7**

Komagome Station -> Hamamatsucho 208¬•

*I walked to the* ***Tokyo Tower*** *and also saw some other interesting buildings that I wanted to see, such as the* ***Reiyukai Shakaden Temple*** *(looks almost fake) and generally just walked around a lot.*

Shimbashi Station -> Komagome Station 208¬•

Komagome Station -> Ikebukuro Station 167¬•

Spicy Rice Noodles with Chicken, Coke 2120¬•

Had Dinner at Jiang Lai, never had Uyghur food before, tasted extremely authentic, saw 0 tourists and barely Japanese people in the restaurant, **one of the best food** I had during my trip.

Ikebukuro must I add is sick, if I were to go to Tokyo again, **it would definitely be on a list** of places I'd book a hotel in.

Uniqlo T-Shirt 1500¬•

Book-Off Cards 1100¬•

Vending Machine Drink 170¬•

Ikebukuro Station -> Komagome Station 167¬•

**Day 8**

Rikugi-en Park entry 300¬•

*One of the* ***most beautiful Parks I went to***\*, compared to The Imperial Palace, mostly locals, also in Komagome, so I walked there from my Hotel.\*

Komagome Station -> Shinjuku Station 178¬•

2800¬• Chicken Nanban at Miyazaki Food Quwanne

I saw that restaurant on Tabelog and it looked very interesting as they also won a Gold Prize in some sort of ""Karaage Grand Prix"", the chicken itself was a bit weird for me to eat because it was so juicy and thick, easily **best quality restaurant** I went to, but **not my favorite**, I am just not used to those sort of restaurants.

Black Coffee from Vending Machine 170¬•

Shinjuku Station -> Komagome Station 178¬•

**Day 9**

Komagome Station -> Okaichimachi Station 167¬•

Okaichimachi Station -> Ebisu Station 208¬•

Spicy Fried Chicken Ramen 2180¬•

I don't eat pork so I went with a place that had chicken based ramen, the ramen itself was pretty good but it was too much onion and garlic that they added, for my taste.

Ebisu Station -> Komagome Station 208¬•

3L Water, Melon Pan, Bread with Peanuts, Pulemon Drink, Yogurt Drink Strawberry at Lawson 783¬•

**Day 10**

Komagome Station -> Harajuku Station 208¬•

*Went around Harajuku, such as the rooftop Garden, checked some second hand shops out,* ***way too pricy***\*, (already expected it though) walked to Shibuya and also explored that place again.\*

Shibuya Station -> Komagome Station 208¬•

Cooked Rice, 2 Eggs, Baguette at Energy Super Tajima 474¬•

2 Eggs, Cabbage Mix, 1L Sparkling Water at Family Mart 471¬•

*Not sure whether it was the ramen I had the day earlier, or the constant sweets that I had for breakfast, one thing is for sure, I had an upset stomach and just ate the safest food I could eat that day.*

**Day 11**

Komagome Station -> Ikebukuro Station 167¬•

*I mostly stayed in Ikebukuro that day, went to lots of stores, really liked that city.*

Torikizoku 3x Chicken Skewers, Ginger Ale, Ice Cream Mochi, Milkshake 2340¬•

*Really nice restaurant, definitely* ***doable for solo experience*** *as most restaurants in Japan, however I feel like this is the* ***perfect spot to go in a small group***\*, maybe get a bit tipsy, order some drinks, talk about stuff, and order more\* skewers\*, this what I observed from most of the groups there.\*

*I have to add that the* ***food itself wasn't top quality***\*, Yakiniku Like for example (although it was beef), was noticeably better quality, most people going to Torikizoku probably know this, since their main revenue is most likely drinks, considering that factor, and also that everything at Torikizoku is pretty inexpensive, it doesn't seem to matter that much.\*

Souvenirs at Donki 5008¬•

Ikebukuro Station -> Komagome Station 167¬•

**Day 12**

Komagome Station -> Okachimachi Station 167¬•

Naka-Okachimachi Station -> Ningyocho Station 178¬•

This was the day where I checked out of my APA Hotel Komagome Ekimae Hotel and checked into the Nine Hours Ningyoch≈ç Capsule Hotel.

There was one Problem that I expected, I had to check out at 10:00am and check in at the Nine Hours Hotel was 3PM, however they allowed people to leave their luggage at the hotel (safely stored in a room for staff).

Excelsior Cafe Drink and Cheesecake 1080¬•

Anker Wall Charger at 7/11 1749¬•

Coco Ichibanya Chicken Cutlet Curry, Drink, Fries 1373¬•

**Day 13**

Starbucks Yuzu Lemon Tea & Root Vegetable Chicken Salad Wrap 971¬•

*Unlike at the APA Hotel, I no longer had the option of storing food in a fridge, I had to get my breakfast that same day, theoretically, I could have had food in the lobby, which is allowed, but I just went to random Cafes every day.*

Ningyocho Station -> Hibiya Station 178¬•

Yuzu & Lemon Soda at 7/11 108¬•

*Went to the Hibiya Park, although a bit small, beautiful and also very close to the Tokyo Imperial Palace which I walked to right after staying at the Hibiya Park for a while.*

*The Tokyo Imperial Palace was insanely big, I loved the contrast between the urban city in the back, and the crisp nature in the park, their Souvenir Shop is also really nice.*

Hibiya Station -> Ningyocho Station 178¬•

Ningyocho Station -> Asakusa Station 178¬•

*I primarily went to Asakusa to have Dinner and since Shogun Burger was also located there, just to see that part of Tokyo as well, when I went it was already a bit late,* ***really interesting city*** *though.*

Shogun Burger Wagyu Cheeseburger, Drink, Fries 2140¬•

*The Shogun Burger was really good, I would say, if you like a nasty (in a good way) sort of burger,* ***cheesy, juicy, dripping burger***\*, where you need a shower afterwards, then\* ***this is probably the spot to go***\*, me personally I enjoyed the Burger that I had on Day 3 (JustA Burger) a tad bit more, but Shogun Burger is not overhyped or anything, it's actually good.\*

*Tokyo Skytree was on my list but I basically wrote it off because I only had one day left, so I was happy to see it glowing on my way to go back to Train Station, so instead of taking the train, I crossed a bridge, walked for a while and ended up right in front of the Skytree, took some pics then took a train back to my Hotel,* ***probably one of the best walks I had during my entire trip.***

Honjo-Azumabashi Station -> Ningyocho Station 178¬•

**Day 14**

Ningyocho Station -> Roppongi Station 209¬•

This was basically my last day, as the next day, I planned to leave early, taking the train to the Airport at around 9AM, so I wanted to get the most out of it.

Salon de The Rond, Cake & Iced Coffee 1650¬•

I didn't even know that this Cafe was popular because of Your Name, although I watched that movie years ago, I just liked the Architecture, Cake itself was good but a bit too gelatinous for me.

Not to make the Cafe sound like it's a bad spot, but I guess that most people go there for the aesthetics.

Souvenirs at Tokyo National Arts Center 4422¬•

The Tokyo National Arts Center itself was amazing, although I didn't even go for the art exhibition, I easily spent almost 2 hours in the Library, really interesting collection.

Nogizaka Station -> Omote-Sando Station 178¬•

Souvenir at The Spiral 950¬•

The Spiral was also on my List as the building seemed very cool and artistic, when I went there their theme was on Umbrellas and they were selling handmade, really nice looking Umbrellas which did cost 30k-40+-¬• though.

There was also a Cafe which I didn't go to but the entire building looked pretty nice.

Omote-Sando Station -> Shimbashi Station 178¬•

Went to the Shizuoka Press and Broadcasting Center Building because it looked very unique, walked around and ended up in Ginza.

Ginza Station -> Ningyocho Station 178¬•

Okashi No Machioka Snacks, Drinks 2527¬•

Saizeriya Pizza, Cheese Grilled Chicken, Popcorn Shrimp, Drink 1400¬•

Initially I wanted to try good Pizza in Tokyo, I bookmarked various spots such as Savoy, Pizza Marumo and so on, however I thought to myself, if you think about Pizza, Saizeriya is probably the place where someone like myself, who doesn't like those higher class restaurants would go (although Savoy and Pizza Marumo probably are pretty chill)

The food at Saizeriya is what you would expect, not the best quality, it's like the Fake Italian Version of a  McDonalds, did I regret going there? Absolutely not

I enjoyed the food and it was probably the friendliest staff out of every single restaurant I went to.

Family Mart Snacks, Drinks 1620¬• (to bring back home)

Vending Machine Drinks 210¬•

**Day 15**

Ningyocho Station -> Narita Airport 1410¬•

Drinks at Airport 440¬•

Mochi at Airport 700¬•

Experience at Hotel:

**APA Hotel Komagome Ekimae:**

Positives:

* Good Location, right by the Station (Yamanote Line)
* fair rate
* never had any issues with loud guests

Neutral:

* Komagome is a residential city, I mostly saw Locals which depending on the person, is either a good thing or bad thing, I liked the contrast, coming back from Shinjuku Station or any big Station.
* the room was a bit small, not a problem for me, might be a problem for some people

Negatives:

* not that much to see as compared to staying in Asakusa, Ikebukuro or similar
* the beds were fairly comfortable but maybe it's just me, I just hate those extremely thick blankets and was forced to sleep without one because it was just way too uncomfortable
* I just went with the cheapest option but it isn't a rumor that the Hotel Chain has a somewhat weird rep, I didn't have the privilege to go with another Business Hotel because APA was just the cheapest

Overall experience:

Not really that much to say, it's a cheap Business Hotel in a residential city.

**Nine Hours Ningyoch≈ç Capsule Hotel:**

Positives:

* Good Location, Hibiya Line and Asakusa Line both on the Ningyoch≈ç Station
* Good price, I saved more than 100‚Ç¨ because I went with that Hotel for 3 days as compared to the APA Hotel.
* you have your Privacy compared to some Hostels, where you literally see other guests sleeping next to you, also people don't really talk to each other however I managed to chat to some people
* most people were kind, you also had every nationality which was cool
* showers were nice, clean beds, clean towels every day, they provide indoor clothing (which I didn't wear)

Neutral:

* If you stay consecutive days, you are forced to leave the Hotel by 10AM until 3PM (only allowed to enter Lobby) since they clean the showers, toilets and beds, you can't even use your Lockers. Although this seemed like a major negative point for me, it forced me to wake up early, get out and  just see the city, which I otherwise would have not done to this extend.
* Either you are lucky with the Showers/Toilet or someone leaves it in a mess, I wasn't unlucky.
* I am a very light sleeper but had no issues sleeping with the earplugs, although they were a bit uncomfortable to sleep with.

Negatives:

* The Toilet situation can be a problem, in the morning I almost always had to wait because there were only 3 Toilets for one entire floor, probably 20+ beds, the first day I arrived, 2 of those Toilets were locked the entire day, not sure what was going on there.
* Although there are many showers, one evening I went to shower and every single one was taken, also 30 minutes later, then eventually when I went an hour later I found one which was free.
* The beds are all connected to each other and while earplugs deafen everything, you still feel the vibrations when someone enters their capsule or moves around.

Overall experience:

Many people say that only drunks who miss their last train visit such Hotels, I mostly saw tourists who were mostly kind, not disruptive and didn't look like the typical cheap sort of Tourist.

I was a bit scared because I booked 3 nights and kept reading that Capsule Hotels are only for one or two nights at most, I could have easily stayed more than 3 nights but it's worth the money to go for a proper Hotel. (long term)

**Language:**

Before coming to Japan I did learn a few phrases and it was definitely a good decision because I underestimated how little english people actually speak there, even in Tokyo.

Most of the time however, I had absolutely no problems, I only used Google Translate once.

**Transportation:**

For Transportation I always used my Apple Wallet Suica Card and took trains throughout Tokyo, and from and to the Airport, absolutely never had the thought of taking a Taxi, Public Transport is superb in Tokyo.

I have to add that it can be a bit confusing in the beginning, but those videos and memes on Shinjuku having 100 exits are mostly fearmongering, first few days are probably worst but everyone will get used to it.

Just follow the signs and check which Station Google Maps tells you to go to, and which Exit to take and you will have no problems.

**Food:**

The wide range of restaurants in this City is absolutely insane, from different cuisines to cheap and expensive food, you can probably get everything in Tokyo, no wonder it's the City with the most Michelin rated restaurants.

**The people:**

Coming from Germany, our people are known to be quite cold and direct, it was odd to see one people who seemed so extremely kind, sometimes I even felt bad for receiving this sort of kindness, which in some cases can look forced or fake, but most of the time I felt like everyone was just very kind, even tourists.

**Solo Travel Aspect:**

I am fairly introverted and don't go out that much, so this entire trip was the worst thing that I could have done because it put me right out of my comfort zone, but I loved it.

The first days, I have to admit, I didn't enjoy that much, especially the first 2 days I felt like I made a big mistake, but in the end I always did what I wanted to do, went wherever I felt like going, had whatever I wanted to eat for dinner, everything depended on only one person, myself.

If anyone has the chance to Solo Travel, I would say do it! At least once in your life.

Sometimes it did feel a bit lonely, being in this huge city all alone, but it felt pretty cool at the same time, I was there, just another person who nobody truly cared about (not meant in negative way).

One day I wasn't that motivated to go out twice and instead stayed at the Hotel and watched Perfect Days, the film that was set in Tokyo, I wanted to watch a movie in Japan about Japan anyway, not sure if a friend would have let me stay at the Hotel and not argue about going out since it wasn't late.

Generally Japan just feels like the perfect country if you want to solo travel.

My only regrets were not going to another City for one day, I planned on going to Kamakura but ran out of time unfortunately. Tokyo is just so huge.

I originally asked chatgpt to make multiple generations, describing the kind of character I wanted loosely to create Image 1. Once i was satisfied with that, I then just literally asked it to generate the rest of the images that keeps the context of the scene. And i didn't need to do any crazy prompting for this.  All i said originally was ""I want a featureless humanoid figure as an archer that's defending a castle wall, with a small sidekick next to him"".  It created like 5 copies, I chose the one I liked, and i then continued on with the scene with that as the context.

If you were to go about this EXACT process to generate a base scene image, and then the 4 additional images that maintain the full artistic style of image 1, but just depicting completely different things within the scene, how would you do it?  

There is a consistent character that I also want to depict between scenes, but there is a lot of variability in how he can be depicted.  What matters most to me is v*isual consistency within the scene*.  If I'm at the bottom of a hellscape of fire in image 1, i want to be in the exact same hellscape in image 5, only now we're looking at the top view looking down instead of bottom looking up.

Also, does your answer change if you wanted to depict a scene that is completely without a character? 

Say i generated this image for example: [https://imgur.com/C1pYlyr](https://imgur.com/C1pYlyr)

This image depicts a long corridor with a bunch of portal doors.  Let's say I now wanted to depict a 3/4 view looking into one of these portals that depicts a scene with a dream-like view of a cloud castle wonderscape inside, but the perspective was such that you could tell you were still in the same scene as the original corridor image - how would you do that?

Does it come down to generating the base image via comfyUI and then whatever model you generated it with and settings you just keep and then you use it as a base image in a secondary workflow?

Let me know if you guys think that the workflow id have to do with comfyUI is any more / less tedious then to just keep generating with chatgpt.  Using natural language to explain what I want and negotiating with chatgpt to fix revisions of images has been somewhat tedious but im actually getting the creations I want in the end.  My main issue with chatgpt is simply the length of time I have to wait between generations. It is painfully slow. And i have an RTX 4090 that im already using for animating the final images that id love to speed generate with.

But the main thing that I'm worried about, is that that even if I can get consistency, there will be a huge amount that goes into the prompting to actually get the different parts of the scene that I want to depict. In my original example above, i don't know how I'd get image 4 for instance.  Something like - ""I need the original characters generated in image 1, but i need a top view looking down of them standing in the castle courtyard with the army of gremlins surrounding them from all angles.""  

How would comfyUI have any possible idea of what im talking about without like 5 reference images to go into the generation?

Extra bonus if you recreate the scene from my example without using my reference images, using a process that you detail below.",12,1758843475.0,StableDiffusion,1,1.0,False

1nqm63t,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1nqm63t/how_do_i_get_over_a_situationship_who_seemed/,How do I get over a situationship who seemed perfect,"I (19M) was in a situationship with a girl (18F)until 1 week ago, we started talking in the middle of August trough instagram and basically just clicked, our talks were pretty smooth and she was really easy to talk with, we liked the same books, movies, had similar values and dreams. At that time I was trying not get to hasty about her because I broke up with my ex only 3 months before I started talking to her, after a few days of texting we decided to meet up, the day before she texted me saying something had happened and that she couldn‚Äôt keep talking to me because wasn‚Äôt going to be able to answer properly and it was better if we just stopped talking for a while, which honestly was pretty annoying but it was ok I guess, at least she gave me a heads up. A few weeks after that I was drinking with a friend and I talked about her, when I got home she had republished an edit of my favorite movie on tik tok so i decided to text her one last time to try again, we started talking the next day and she apologized for what happened before, we then decided to meet at a coffee shop that‚Äôs also a bookstore because we both like to read, the date was honestly amazing, we talked nonstop and even kissed for a while in my car, and I just realized she had everything I wanted in a relationship, so I talked to her still on the first date that I was looking for something more serious, she said she wanted to see how things would go but that she really liked me.
For the rest of the week we kept texting and talking, she was saying how she never met someone liked me, that I looked like those guys that went out of a romance movie, which honestly got me falling for her, then we went for dinner, I brought her flowers, she almost cried happy tears because of it, I could hear her sister saying ‚ÄúNO WAY‚Äù as she went to leave the flowers inside her place, and when we got to the restaurant I decided to be honest with her and say that I really liked and that I hoped we could actually try for something more serious, she said that she also wanted that, during the date she said that she never really thought of marriage until she met me, that I was beautiful and all that stuff, honestly I never felt so good until that point, after dinner we went for a walk and ice cream by the lake, after that we stayed in my car kissing for a few minutes with music on the background, on the way back she said that she had never been trough something like that and that I was different, too perfect to be true (something I said to her before) then I just said I hope we get married someday, she looked at me smiled and said I really hope for that too and kissed on the cheek, the whole way back we where holding hands, and when I got home she had texted me that she had a great night that she couldn‚Äôt wait to see me again.
Next day she said that her priority right now need to be in school (she‚Äôs a senior in high school and there‚Äôs an equivalent to the SAT in my country but that basically defines whether you go to college or not, just a single test) but that she was willing to try things with because she really liked me. Then I said that I just wish I could support her and be her number 1 fan on her journey, she said ‚Äúthen we will make things work‚Äù.
Literally the next day, she went to see her mom (she wasn‚Äôt talking to her mom for about a month, all her family knew about me except her mom, who cheated on her father and married a man who is a cop and yells at the girl and the mom and humiliates them constantly) when she got back from her mom‚Äôs she said that thinks we are going to fast and that she‚Äôs scared of dating, that hurt but I said let‚Äôs just stay cool with each other and wait to see how things go.
The rest of the week she was pulling away, taking to long to answer and canceling plans, then I was starting to get paranoid and texted her after 3 days that I couldn‚Äôt keep things as they were, it wasn‚Äôt being good and that I wanted things to go back as they, she apologized but said that she was too scared of rushing things and blowing them, I said that slowing down is okay but not stopping everything we where doing until that point, she said it was better if we went our separate ways because we would just keep hurting each other, I respected her wishes but I cried like crazy after that, started taking anxiety meds, antidepressants, I swear that I never felt so heartbroken even when my girlfriend of 1 year ended things I wasn‚Äôt that in shambles. 
On Saturday I reached out to her saying that I really missed talking to her, and basically everything I wasn‚Äôt feeling at that time, she said I was very special, that she still liked me but that she couldn‚Äôt stay with me because she wasn‚Äôt ready, we went back and forth for a few texts until I said that I hoped in sometime we could be together, honestly right now I‚Äôm planning on after the big exams try and reach out to her again, because honestly she had everything I ever wanted and I feel like I will never meet someone like her.
Sorry for any grammar spells, English is not my first language and I‚Äôm writing this with a lot of emotions right now.

1nqm0l6,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1nqm0l6/the_night_she_found_me/,The Night She Found Me,"The air in my cramped little apartment felt off that Tuesday night, thick with a weird unease that stuck to my skin. It was just past midnight when the storm outside killed the power, plunging the city into darkness. My phone, laptop, even the fridge‚Äôs hum, all gone silent. I cursed my cheap landlord under my breath as I groped for a flashlight, stubbing my toe on the coffee table in the process. That‚Äôs when I heard it: a faint rustle, like dry leaves scraping the pavement, coming from the living room. I told myself it was just the wind rattling the windows, but my gut twisted with doubt.

Growing up, my uncle used to spin wild tales about Nyx over campfires, his voice shaky with a mix of fear and awe. He‚Äôd describe her as a shadow-woven goddess, stalking the night to snatch lost souls. I always rolled my eyes, figuring it was just his way of spooking me after too many beers. But as I limped into the living room, the cold hit me like a slap, and that rustling turned sharper, more purposeful. My flashlight shook in my hand as I swept it around, landing on the curtains swaying despite the closed window.

Then I caught her reflection, or thought I did. A woman stood behind me, her shape a swirling mess of shadows, her eyes like bottomless pits. I whipped around, heart pounding so hard I could feel it in my throat, but she was gone. The rustling stopped, replaced by a low hum that buzzed in my chest, pulling me toward the corner where the darkness seemed to breathe. I should‚Äôve bolted, but my legs felt like lead, rooted to the spot.

The shadows pulsed, and there she was‚ÄîNyx. She was beautiful in a way that made my stomach churn, with sharp cheekbones and a smile that didn‚Äôt touch her hollow eyes. Her hair flowed like liquid night, and her gown writhed like living shadows. In her hand, she held a glowing orb that pulsed with the hum. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve called me,‚Äù she said, her voice soft and melodic, wrapping around my brain like a lullaby I couldn‚Äôt escape.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt!‚Äù I stammered, stumbling back, but she glided closer, the orb floating toward me. It felt like my soul was being yanked out, memories flashing, nightmares from when I was a kid, that time I got lost in the woods, the panic attacks I‚Äôd tried to forget. I clawed at the air, desperate, and then the lights flickered back on, flooding the room. Nyx hissed, dissolving into smoke, but not before whispering, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll return when the light fades.‚Äù The orb vanished, and I hit the floor, gasping for air.

The storm had passed, but that hum stuck with me, a creepy reminder of her words. Since then, things have been off. The lights keep flickering, and shadows linger too long. Last night, I found a footprint in the dust by my bed, too small to be mine, with weird claw marks. I‚Äôve been Googling Nyx nonstop, digging through old forums and dusty books, but it‚Äôs all scattered bits, some say she‚Äôs a night guardian, others a soul collector. One guy online swore she leaves a cold spot as a mark. I checked today, and sure enough, there‚Äôs one by the window where I first saw her. It‚Äôs growing.

I‚Äôm a mess, hands shaking, barely sleeping. I‚Äôve been keeping the lights on, but the bulbs burn out fast now. Last night, I woke to that hum again, louder, and saw her silhouette in my doorway. She just stared, those eyes drilling into me. I haven‚Äôt slept since. I‚Äôm thinking of ditching this place, but where do you go when the darkness follows? The landlord ghosts me, and my neighbors act like I‚Äôm crazy when I mention the hum. Maybe she‚Äôs got them too.

I‚Äôm writing this as a heads-up, a desperate shout into the void. If you live alone and hear a hum during a storm, don‚Äôt check it out. Lock your doors, blast every light, and pray she skips you. If you find a cold spot, run. Because once Nyx marks you, the night doesn‚Äôt let go, and I‚Äôm pretty sure she‚Äôs got me in her sights.

I would start off by saying something like ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt know if anyone remembers me‚Äô but you‚Äôve all been very vocal in my inbox this past month so I‚Äôm just going to assume that yes, some of you do.

This all got much more attention than I ever expected, so I‚Äôm honestly quite nervous to even update this cos I just know the result really isn‚Äôt what most of you wanted or were hoping for. But my boyfriend and my flatmate were having a field day with all your comments and messages - they asked me to say thanks to the person that ‚Äòcame up with the bio mum amnesia car accident theory‚Äô? I don‚Äôt know either, I stopped reading comments eventually, but they really enjoyed that one ‚Äì so the two of them were basically bullying me into this.

I‚Äôm not really sure where to start so I‚Äôll just go by what I was asked the most, I guess.

Oh and, before that I kind of feel the need to clarify‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt call my ex my ex irl. I call him by his name. Right? I got multiple messages asking me to stop calling him that ‚Äòsince we‚Äôre more than that at this point‚Äô so, just to make that clear. I call him by his first name.

Okay now, first things first: We‚Äôre all fine! My niece is fine, my ex and his GF are kind of fine and I‚Äôm grand as well. Thanks for checking in and even sending us those‚Ä¶reddit care thingies? You know what I mean.

Then a lot of you were asking about my niece and if we ever found out what was bothering her and yes, we did.

My ex dropped off my niece at my place not long after I posted the second update (it was her turn to stay at my place) and she was still in a shitty mood just like she‚Äôd been this entire time, if not a bit worse.

So she didn‚Äôt even stay to say bye to my ex, she just stomped off into her room and holed herself up for the day. My ex asked me if I could try and have a chat with her while she stayed over cos apparently he‚Äôd tried and it didn‚Äôt go over well. I think we were both kind of on edge cos this isn‚Äôt usually her style but then again‚Ä¶teens will teen.

Anyway, I told him I‚Äôd try and send him on his merry way for now. It took me a couple of days to actually get to the chatting. The first few days were really‚Ä¶woof. It‚Äôs like I was sharing my house with a particularly pissed off velociraptor. I basically spent the entire time throwing snacks and wee little trinkets at her, hoping she‚Äôll not bite my hand off in the process.

But eventually she cooled off enough and with some fine needling and enough ice cream to feed an army I managed to get some answers.

Good News: The GF did not talk to her. So, lower thy pitchforks, reddit, the woman is ney a witch.

Bad News: My niece did overhear the GF bad mouthing me on the phone, like some of you guessed.

The GF apparently didn‚Äôt know that my niece was home ‚Äì she came home early from school and the GF didn‚Äôt hear her come in ‚Äì so I doubt it was on purpose but it still happened and my niece did not take it well.

She‚Äôd been in a bad mood anyway (just normal teen-struggles, mind. Including ‚Äì gods help me ‚Äì boy troubles. Does anyone have a handbook on how to handle THAT!? Cos I‚Äôm not ready and since my ex took the news like a man going to war, I seriously doubt he's either.) and hearing the GF talk shit certainly didn‚Äôt help.

She really didn‚Äôt want to tell me what exactly the GF said, but it seemed to have been really below the belt. Just going the fact that my niece was angry-crying during that part of our chat.  
I didn‚Äôt pressure to tell me more since it just seemed to upset her, but I did ask her to please tell her dad what was said so that she could get it off of her chest, which she did do after both my ex and I promised that he wouldn‚Äôt tell me either.

I know that‚Äôs kind of a let down for some of you, but to be honest: I don‚Äôt really care. If she wants to talk shit, she can. I‚Äôm just happy my niece doesn‚Äôt have to carry that stuff around on her own anymore.

Now, as for my ex and his GF‚Ä¶difficult.

It took a while longer for that to get resolved. I actually didn‚Äôt hear anything back until quite recently and the end result is kind of‚Ä¶meh?

The short of it is: I was catching strays. That‚Äôs all.

My ex eventually called me and told me that much. He also said that his GF would like to talk to me personally and asked me to hear her out. Which fine, sure, I‚Äôll do that.

So, they rocked up to my place about a week ago and we all had tea.  
Let me tell you: It was awks. The GF was really twitchy and nervous the entire time and I think we spent twenty minutes just talking about the weather before she finally managed to cough up an apology. That apology was then followed by fifty more, no matter how often I told her that it was okay and that I was more than content to just move on.

She was thankful, but she asked me if I‚Äôd let her explain herself, so I did.

And yeah, turns out she‚Ä¶well, she didn‚Äôt really have a reason to come at me, but she did have a reason overall for why she acted the way she did.

The first and probably biggest reason I won‚Äôt tell you, cos it goes far beyond me telling you about something I was involved in or me sitting here like ‚Äòwell she was being a bit of a c\*nt, what do I do?‚Äô. But let it be said: Something sad happened. It wasn‚Äôt anyone‚Äôs fault. Nobody did anything wrong. It was just something tragic that happens to some people and couldn‚Äôt be avoided. That‚Äôs all.

The second reason was that she apparently had a minor dispute with my ex about‚Ä¶kind of me, I guess? So, from what the two of them told me, the GF texted my ex not long before she first messaged me and asked him if he could pick her up from work cos she wasn‚Äôt feeling well. He told her that yes, he would, but it‚Äôd take him a while since he was about to drop my niece off at my place.

Now, what he meant by that was: The drive will take longer than usual cos \[my name\] lives at the other end of town.

What she took it as was: \[My name\] is more important than you right now, so you‚Äôll have to wait.  
(Honestly, I do not get it either. I wasn‚Äôt even the reason he was coming over, so I‚Äôm not sure why that is how she took it. But okay, fine, she was in a state cos of the sad thing, maybe that‚Äôs just how it felt at the time.)

And the third reason is that she feels kind off like the odd one out in my ex‚Äôs (and thus partially my) friend group, which was making her feel insecure. And that‚Äôd be fine, it‚Äôs human, but her reason for feeling like the odd one out was apparently that she‚Äôs straight and most of us are not. That surprised both my ex and I cos‚Ä¶yeah nah, most of our friends are, in fact, straight.  
In our collective friend group, there‚Äôs just me, my boyfriend, my ex (we‚Äôre all bi) and one gay chap + his boyfriend. The rest are straight as hell. Like ‚ÄòI majored in business, have a wife, a dog and 1 ¬Ω children‚Äô type straight lol. So yeah, we didn‚Äôt know how she got that idea and she was honestly very rattled once we‚Äôd cleared that up.

All of that then collided into one big ball of frustration and that frustration was then aimed at the easiest target ‚Äì me. So, she snuck into my ex‚Äôs phone, got my number, and told me to back off.

According to her, she immediately regretted it but didn‚Äôt know how to fix it until my ex put her on the spot. She also reiterated that she really isn‚Äôt bothered by me and that she was being truthful when she‚Äôd told my ex that she‚Äôd like to get to know me more.

I told her that that was fine by me ‚Äì yes, this is me cutting her some slack. She overreacted and made a mistake. Shit happens. ‚Äì but that she might want to try and talk to my niece before that relationship completely evaporated. But once she‚Äôs settled that, I‚Äôm down to meeting for coffee or hanging out as a group with my niece or whatever.

And that is really kind of where we left it.

I DID ask my ex where his head‚Äôs at while the GF was off to the loo and how he‚Äôs feeling and he told me he‚Äôs not quite sure yet. He does see where she‚Äôs coming from and he‚Äôs happy that she owned up to her mistakes and wanted to apologise and all that, but he‚Äôs miffed that she even reacted like that in the first place. You know, that she'd rather sneak into his phone and then b\*tch at me instead of just talking to him.  
Oh and he‚Äôs extremely pissed off about the things she said about me (when my niece overheard her, that is).

I didn‚Äôt ask him more than that cos we‚Äôd promised my niece but I did tell him to not let that be his deciding factor, if anything.  
Apart from that, I didn‚Äôt pry for more.

And that is pretty much it, guys!

Sorry that I can‚Äôt deliver the dramatic story filled with big reveals, harsh realisations, and angry break ups but alas, real life tends to be a bit boring and shit just ends with people having a wee chat over tea.

My boyfriend offered to act out a dramatic scene where I break up with him cos I ‚Äòrealised I‚Äôm still in love with my ex‚Äô in case anyone is interested, lol, but unless that‚Äôs it, this is where we part ways.

Thanks for sticking around and for all the advice you‚Äôve given me! I really didn‚Äôt expect my little issue would get this much attention, so here‚Äôs to me never underestimating reddit again.

My best friend Monica was on top of my husband. Her dark hair spilled over her bare shoulders as she scrambled to cover herself, her eyes wide with shock.
Richard lay beneath her, his face flushed, his hands still gripping her waist like he could not let go.
Our bed. The Egyptian cotton sheets I had bought for our anniversary.
My heart was broken and I could not breathe.
""Claire!"" Monica's voice cracked as she grabbed for the sheet. ""Oh my God, Claire!""
Richard's eyes met mine across the room.
""How long have you been standing there?"" His voice was cold, almost annoyed like I was the one interrupting something I should not have.
""Are you saying I'm disturbing you?"" My tone was sharp as I stared at them.
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
CLAIRE‚ÄôS POV
I should have known something was wrong when I came home to silence.
Richard's car was in the driveway next to Monica's little red BMW, but the house felt empty. Too quiet.
""Richard?"" I called out, setting my purse on the marble table by the front door. ""Monica?""
My best friend had texted me an hour ago, saying she had stopped by to drop off the wedding photos from her cousin's ceremony last weekend.
Monica was always doing thoughtful things like that, bringing over fresh cookies, helping me pick out new curtains, and making sure I never felt lonely when Richard worked late.
Which was most nights lately.
I kicked off my heels and padded through the corridor in my stockings. The living room was empty, but I could hear something from upstairs.
A soft thudding sound, rhythmic and steady.
The sounds were coming from our bedroom.
My stomach twisted with an uneasiness I could not name. Something felt wrong, but I could not put my finger on what.
The air itself seemed heavy, charged with a tension that made my skin tickle.
I paused outside our bedroom door, my hand pausing over the handle. The sounds were clearer now, a rhythmic creaking, soft gasps, and something else.
Something that made my heart start racing for all the wrong reasons.
""Richard?"" I called again, my voice smaller this time.
The sounds stopped.
For a moment, there was complete silence. Then I heard Monica's voice, breathless and panicked: ""Oh God, someone's here.""
My hand shook as I pushed the door open.
And my world shattered into a million pieces.
Monica was on top of my husband. Her dark hair spilled over her bare shoulders as she scrambled to cover herself, her eyes wide with shock.
Richard lay beneath her, his face flushed, his hands still gripping her waist like he could not let go.
Our bed. The Egyptian cotton sheets I had bought for our anniversary. The throw pillows I had embroidered with little hearts during those lonely evenings when Richard worked late.
I could not breathe.
I could not move.
I could not think.
This was not real. This could not be real. Monica was my best friend. She was the one who helped me plan our anniversary dinner just last month.
She was the one who listened to me worry about Richard working too much, and who guaranteed me that all successful men went through phases like this.
She was the one who told me I was lucky to have such a devoted husband.
""Claire!"" Monica's voice cracked as she grabbed for the sheet. ""Oh my God, Claire!""
Richard's eyes met mine across the room. For just a second, I saw a flash of something‚Ä¶guilt, maybe, or regret. But then his face went hard, like a door slamming shut.
""How long have you been standing there?"" His voice was cold, almost annoyed like I was the one interrupting something I should not have.
How long? The question echoed in my head, but I could not make sense of it. How long had I been watching my life fall apart? How long had I been staring at the two people I trusted most in the world betraying me in the most intimate way possible?
""I... I just got home,"" I whispered. My voice sounded strange like it was coming from underwater. ""I called for you.""
Monica was crying now, hugging the sheet to her chest. ""Claire, please, you have to understand. We did not mean for this to happen. It just... it just happened.""
It just happened. Like they had accidentally fallen into bed together. Like clothes removed themselves and bodies just found each other without any choice or decision or betrayal involved.
The room started spinning. The walls seemed to stagger and sway like I was on a boat in rough water. My vision blurred at the edge, and a strange ringing filled my ears.
""Claire?"" Monica's voice sounded far away now. ""Claire, are you okay?""
I looked at Richard again. My husband. The man who had promised to love and cherish me until death do us part.
He was sitting up now, not bothering to cover himself, his blue eyes‚Ä¶.the eyes I had once thought were the most beautiful thing in the world‚Ä¶looking at me like I was a stranger.
Like I was an inconvenience.
""Richard,"" I breathed his name like a prayer.
But he did not answer.
-
In hospital, Richard wore an expensive suit and a face that belonged in a boardroom, not a hospital room where his wife was there.
But now is not the time to think about these.
""Richard."" I reached for his hand, but he pulled it away before I could touch him. ""We need to talk about what happened. About Monica. About us.""
Something flashed across his face, but it was gone so fast I might have imagined it.
""You're right,"" he said. ""We do need to talk.""
Relief flooded through me. Thank God. He wanted to work this out. We could get through this. Marriages survived infidelity all the time.
We could go to counseling, we could‚Ä¶.
Richard pulled an envelope from his jacket and set it on the bedside table.
My heart stopped.
""What is that?"" I whispered, even though some part of me already knew. Some part of me had been preparing for this moment since I saw the coldness in his eyes yesterday.
""Divorce papers."" His voice was steady, businesslike. ""My lawyer had them drawn up this morning.""
The words hit me like a physical blow. I flinched, my hand flying to my chest where it felt like something was tearing apart.
""Divorce papers,"" I repeated because surely I had misheard.
Surely my husband of three years was not sitting in my hospital room, while I was recovering from emergency surgery, handing me divorce papers.
""I want this done quickly and quietly,"" he continued like he was discussing a merger or a stock trade. ""No messy custody battles, no drawn-out proceedings. Clean and simple.""
I stared at him, searching his face for any trace of the man I had married. The man who used to bring me coffee in bed every Sunday morning.
The man who used to dance with me in the kitchen while dinner was cooked. The man who used to tell me I was the most beautiful woman in the world.
""Richard,"" My voice broke on his name. ""Is it because of Monica?‚Äù
He was silent for a while before he spoke, ""Monica is everything you're not,"" he continued, his voice never changing, never showing any emotion at all. ""She's independent. She has her own career, her own friends, and her own interests. She does not need me to validate her existence.""
Monica. My best friend. The woman who had held me while I cried about feeling disconnected from my husband.
The woman who had told me that Richard was just going through a stressful period at work. The woman who had encouraged me to be more understanding, more patient, more helpful.
Had she been planning this all along? Had every conversation we had about my marriage been her gathering information, figuring out exactly how to steal my husband away from me?
""How long?"" I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.
""What?""
""How long have you been sleeping with her?""
Richard's jaw tightened. For the first time since he had walked into this room, he looked uncomfortable.
""That's not important.""
""It is to me."" I tried to sit up straighter, ignoring the pain in my side. ""How long have you been lying to me? How long have you been coming home to me after being with her?""
""Six months.""
Six months. Half a year of betrayal. Half a year of lies. Half a year of him smooching me goodnight with the same mouth he had been using to smooch her.
""Sign the papers,"" he said, his tone final. ""The settlement is generous. More than generous. You'll be able to buy a nice condo somewhere, start over.""
Start over. Like three years of marriage could just be erased. Like the life we had built together was nothing more than a rough draft that could be crumpled up and thrown away.
""What if I don't sign?"" I asked, even though I already knew the answer.
""Then I will challenge it. I will drag this through the courts for years. I will make sure everyone knows exactly why our marriage failed."" His blue eyes‚Ä¶the eyes I had once thought were the most beautiful thing in the world‚Ä¶.went ice cold.
I looked down at my left hand, at the wedding ring that had lived there for three years. The ring Richard had slipped onto my finger while he promised to love and cherish me until death do us part.
I twisted it off my finger and held it out to him.
""Take it,"" I whispered.
He stared at the ring for a long moment, and for just a second, I thought I saw something crack in his carefully controlled face.
But then he took the ring and slipped it into his pocket without a word.
I picked up the pen the lawyer had left with the papers.
My hand trembled as I brought it to the signature line. Claire Blackwood, I started to write, then stopped.
That was not my name anymore, was it? I was not Mrs. Richard Blackwood. I was just Claire. Claire nobody. Claire with no identity except the one I had lost when I had given up everything to be his wife.
I set the pen down and closed my eyes.
Somewhere in this hospital, there were other women recovering from surgery. Women with husbands who held their hands and brought them flowers and whispered words of love and comfort.
Women whose marriages were real, whose love was valued, whose hearts were not being ripped out of their chests by the very person who was supposed to protect them.
But I was not one of those women.
I was Claire, the woman who was not enough. The woman who loved too much. The woman who was so pathetic and clingy that her husband could not wait to escape her.
I opened my eyes and picked up the pen again.
This time, I signed.
""Good,"" he said, gathering up the papers. ""That makes this easier.""
""Makes what easier?""
Richard sat down in the chair again, but this time he leaned forward, his elbows on his knees, his blue eyes fixed on my face with an intensity that made my skin crawl.
""Monica's pregnant. And we are getting married,"" he smiled, ""As soon as the divorce is final.""
Pregnant. Married.
The words hit me like a cargo train. Monica was pregnant with Richard's baby. The baby I had been hoping for, praying for, dreaming about for three years.
""How long?"" I whispered.
""Two months."" Richard's voice was steady, matter-of-fact. ""We're telling people after the wedding.""
Two months.
She had been pregnant when she helped me plan our anniversary dinner. She had been carrying Richard's child when she sat in my living room and listened to me worry about our marriage.
She had been growing his baby inside her while she comforted me and told me everything would be okay.
""Claire?"" Richard's voice seemed to come from very far away. ""Are you all right?""
All right? Was I all right?
My husband had just told me I disgusted him. He had told me our entire marriage was a lie. He had told me he had been sickened by my touch for months.
And now he was telling me that my best friend was pregnant with his child.
Was I all right?
I started to laugh.
It came out as a broken, hysterical sound that did not seem to belong to me. I laughed until tears streamed down my face, until I could not breathe.
""Claire."" Richard stepped back into the room, and for the first time since this conversation started, he looked worried. ""Claire, stop. You're scaring me.""
Scaring him? That was rich. He had just finished telling me I was the most pathetic, disgusting, suffocating woman alive, and now he was scared because I was laughing?
""I'm sorry,"" I gasped between fits of laughter. ""I'm just trying to figure out how I'm supposed to thank you for this favor you're doing me.""
""Claire‚Ä¶‚Äù
""No, really,"" I continued, my laughter taking on an edge that made even me nervous. ""You've given me such a gift. You've shown me exactly how pathetic I am. How worthless. How completely unlovable.""
""That's not what I‚Ä¶‚Äù
""Isn't it?"" I wiped the tears from my cheeks with the back of my hand.
""You've made it very clear, Richard. I'm disgusting. I'm suffocating. I'm so nauseous that my own husband couldn't stand to touch me. And my best friend? She's carrying your baby while I'm lying here like the pathetic fool I am.""

I am now read 44 (have 3 more month left)). Here‚Äôs everything that actually worked, everything that failed, and the surprising lessons I learned about reading.



# What DIDN'T Work



* Speed reading techniques are BS. I wasted weeks on apps and methods. Faster reading just meant worse comprehension. Sometimes slower is actually faster.
* Reading only self-improvement books. I burned out hard by month six. Variety is absolutely crucial; forcing yourself through ""productive"" books makes reading feel like homework.
* Digital-only reading. Reading on a Kindle or my phone was too distracting. Physical books were the only way to achieve deep, sustained focus.



# What ACTUALLY Worked



* The 25% Rule. If I wasn't engaged after 25% of any book, I quit immediately. This single rule increased my completion rate dramatically. Life's too short for boring books.
* Mixed Format Approach. I used physical books for deep focus, audiobooks for commutes, and e-books (for travel). Matching the format to the context makes reading seamless.
* Genre Rotation System. I alternated genres ruthlessly: Fiction, then Non-Fiction, then Biography. This kept reading fresh and prevented burnout from any single category.
* Morning Reading Ritual. 30-45 minutes every morning with coffee, before checking any apps or social media. This time became a sacred, protected habit.

Reading 44 books taught me that the goal isn't consuming more content; it's building a better thinking system. It's better to deeply understand 10 good books than to superficially know 100. Quit the boring ones, focus on understanding over speed.

My Dearest Fellow Amazonian Builders (and the contractors we definitely treat exactly the same),

I pen this message whilst perched majestically at my hallowed door desk‚Äîyes, quite literally a door with legs affixed, frightfully affordable, I know‚Äîdespite having the budget for a $47,000 Herman Miller AI-powered standing desk that predicts your posture before you even think about sitting. But you see, dear reader, this is FRUGALITY! \*chef's kiss\* That most noble of our Leadership Principles, which we honour in the same manner that Americans honour tea: by dumping it into the harbour and declaring independence from reason.

# The Sacred Tier 0 Services: Our Digital Deities

Permit me to be devastatingly, crystallinely clear: our tier 0 and tier 1 services are not mere ""computational systems,"" oh heavens no! They are the throbbing ventricles of global capitalism, the synapses through which the collective consciousness of consumer desire flows. When Amazon suffers a ghastly 0.01% downtime, somewhere in the world a high-intent shopper cannot immediately purchase their 47th pair of compression socks, and the entire fabric of society begins to unravel.

This is why we‚Äôve instituted our rather revolutionary ""Sleep is for the Unambitious"" programme. Our on-call engineers now receive bespoke IV infusions containing a proprietary m√©lange of caffeine, the distilled tears of junior developers, and what our chemists call ""Essence of Frugality""‚Äîwhich tastes rather like despair mixed with off-brand instant coffee.

# The Agentic Revolution: Because Human Intelligence Was SO Last Quarter

McKinsey has spoken (at only $3.7 million for their latest PowerPoint), and they have decreed that THE FUTURE IS AGENTIC! Therefore, we are immediately pivoting everything‚Äîand I do mean EVERYTHING‚Äîto AI agents.

Amazon Ads will now be powered by autonomous agents that can detect customer intent before the customer even exists. Our new ""Pre-Conscious Advertising Platform"" (powered by Bedrock, naturally) will serve ads to people based on the purchases their unborn children will make in 2047. ROI? Infinite. Logic? How delightfully American of you to ask!

For Amazon retail, we're launching ""Project Ouroboros""‚ÄîAI agents that order products from our platform to test our AI agents that fulfill orders for our AI agents. It's agents all the way down! Soon, humans will be completely removed from the equation, except for warehouse workers, who we've reclassified as ""Biological Compute Units"" to make the board feel better.

# The Door Desk Paradox: Frugality Meets Infinite AI Spend

Speaking of Frugality, I want to address the elephant in the room. Yes, we still make you build your own desk from a door. Yes, we just spent $47 billion on AI infrastructure. This is not a contradiction! You see, every penny saved on human comfort is a penny we can invest in teaching machines to replace humans. It's poetic, really.

We've even updated our famous ""two pizza team"" rule‚Äîa measurement system so American it makes me want to weep into my Earl Grey. Teams can still only be as large as two pizzas can feed, but now one pizza goes to the AI agent. The agent doesn't consume it, obviously‚Äîit analyses how optimal your choice of toppings is for maximum productivity and creates a report that will be used in your next performance review.

# The Human Element: Still Technically Required (For Now)

To our engineers grinding away at 3 AM to maintain five nines of uptime (99.999%, for those of you educated in the American public school system): your sacrifice is noted and filed appropriately in our HR system, which is now run by an AI that learned empathy from LinkedIn posts.

And to our friends in Seattle, Bangalore, Dublin, and that new office we built inside a volcano (Frugality doesn't apply to supervillain lairs): remember that every dashboard you gaze upon with dead eyes, every Amazon Paging alert that ruins your dinner, every sprint planning meeting that makes you question the choices that led you here‚Äîit all serves the Greater Good of our Glorious Global Capitalist Machine!

# RTO5: Your Desk Awaits (And So Does Big Brother)

Ah yes, our glorious RTO5 initiative‚Äîour mandate that you grace us with your physical presence five days per week, because apparently innovation evaporates through Wi-Fi. Your ""uptime"" is now monitored more closely than our EC2 instances‚Äîat least those get scheduled maintenance windows, ha! Your presence is logged, graphed, dashboarded, and reviewed by AI that can detect if your bathroom breaks exceed the allotted 3.7 minutes.

Your badge data flow into our ""Workplace Analytics Dashboard,"" a marvel of dystopian engineering that would make Orwell positively tumescent. Heat maps of your movements, dwell time at desks (487 minutes daily, minimum), and ""collaboration scores"" based on proximity to other humans. Managers receive push notifications‚Äî""Johnson hasn't badged in!""‚Äîwith the urgency of a Sev-1 outage.

It's corporate daycare for adults with RSUs, complete with the soul-crushing realisation that you're performing innovation theatre for an audience of dashboards and managers fearful of their own managers. But at least the free bananas are back (are they not?). Frugality!

# In Conclusion: Day 1, But With More Artificial Intelligence and Less Natural Intelligence

As I often proclaim at our leadership soir√©es (now conducted entirely by AI avatars whilst we play golf), we must maintain our Day 1 mentality. Except now it's ""Day 1 of the Post-Human Epoch,"" which sounds rather grand when you say it with the proper accent.

The work remains mysterious and important. The music must go on. And if that music is now composed by an AI trained exclusively on the sound of human suffering in our fulfilment centres mixed with Vivaldi's ""Four Seasons,"" well, that's just innovation!

Remember: We're not just building the future. We're building a future where we've innovated ourselves into delightful irrelevance. And that, my dear human resources (soon to be ""formerly human resources""), is the most exquisite disruption of all.

Stay Peculiar,

You know how I'm always trying to work from coffee shops, but my tablet's on-screen keyboard takes up half the screen? I finally found a solution that doesn't feel like I'm lugging around extra baggage. I picked up this foldable portable keyboard, and it's been a total game-changer. It rolls up smaller than my wallet and tucks right into the front pocket of my bag, so I never have an excuse not to bring it.



The best part is the feel of the keys. I was worried it would be like typing on a calculator, but the keys have a surprisingly satisfying click to them. It connects in seconds, and suddenly I have my entire screen back for actual work. It makes the whole process feel so much more intentional, like I'm actually at a workstation instead of just fiddling with a giant phone.



Here's a weird fact I learned while looking into these: the concept of a portable, folding keyboard isn't new at all. There's a patent from the 1970s for a collapsible keyboard meant for early portable computers, back when ""portable"" meant something that weighed 25 pounds. It just took a few decades for the technology to catch up to the idea and make it truly pocket-sized.



It‚Äôs not without its quirks, of course. You do need a flat, stable surface, because typing on a slightly wobbly table is an adventure. But for the freedom it gives me, it's a tiny trade-off. I'm finally that person efficiently typing away in the corner, instead of the one sighing at their own thumbs.

Early 40s female 
Height -5'3
Current weight -204lb
Starting weight November 2024 -213lbs
Heaviest weight -217lbs
Goal weight -150-160lbs
Health conditions -anxiety, IBSD, vestibular migraines, superior canal dehiscence syndrome, reflux, adhd
Current medications -amitriptyline (IBSD, insomnia migraines), propranolol (anxiety, migraines), IUD 
Supplements -l methylfolate, lions mane, soon to be starting CoQ10 and B2 for migraines

Last November during my routine physical, my doctor told me that my cholesterol was high and I needed to start on lipitor. Long story short, I had been putting off getting healthy and fit for a long time, but this was the motivation I needed. The same week I started the lipitor, I signed up with a virtual trainer who also happens to be a family member. Using the trainerize app, we started tracking all my meals and workouts. 

Diet - I'm looking for sustainable weight loss, not a quick fix or fad diet. My trainer has me currently at 1400 calories with 140 grams from protein. I'm also trying to keep my carbs under 30%. The lowest calorie goal we've had me at was 1300. The highest was I think 2500 when we were trying to determine my maintenance number. I believe he estimated it around 2100. For the majority of this experience, I've been eating between 1400 and 1800 calories.

I drink coffee and water daily, rarely drink alcohol or soda. My breakfast lately has been coffee and a nonfat Greek yogurt, a protein shake with soy milk (blender not premade), or occasionally a couple eggs with a piece of sourdough.

Lunch is usually a protein shake, tuna with mayo and a few vegetable crackers, salad with chicken or other meat. 

Dinner is usually a protein like venison, chicken or fish with either a salad or other veggie. 

I don't eat fast food often and when I do eat out, I usually choose a high protein/lower calorie option. 

Workouts - we are lucky to have basically an entire gym in our basement. Lately I've been focusing on strength training mostly upper body as I was dealing with some knee pain from months of endless squats. I do weights usually three days a week and the other days I'll either use my stationary bike, infinity hoop, or I'll be outside doing farm chores or walking. 

Health -as mentioned above, I have some chronic health issues that can make working out complicated. My migraines often cause dizziness and balance issues so I try to avoid moves that have me laying on the ground as getting up often triggers the dizziness. My IBS journey began in 2014, at that time I weighed about 150-160. I was on a very restrictive diet for several years but didn't see any change in my weight. I'm fairly confident that getting my first IUD in 2015 was likely what got the weight gain started. Then in 2019 I started the amitriptyline which worked great for my IBS and insomnia but likely also contributed to my weight gain. With the IBS improved slightly, my diet got a little looser. 

Fast forward to today. Between November and January I dropped from 213 to about 203lb and then I hit a plateau hard. Despite everything I've tried, the lowest weigh in I've had was 201 but I've been mostly stuck around 204 since January. I'm no longer taking lipitor because it was causing joint pain. My last lab work was in I think March and my cholesterol was way down in the healthy ranges. I also asked my doctor about my hormone levels and thyroid. She said my results did not show any issues there. My lady doctor also confirmed that I was not likely suffering from perimenopause or menopause. 

Either my metabolism has completely stopped and or the combination of my birth control and antidepressant are the roadblocks. Unfortunately I do not want to go off the amitriptyline as it's the only thing that has helped me get my IBS under control. I also do not want to get rid of my IUD as not having a cycle anymore has been so amazing. Before anyone asks, my doctor did ask me if I'd want to try a glp one but honestly I have no interest in that kind of weight loss. I'd rather it take me 5 years to hit my goal than to hit it fast but have to take that medication forever without knowing the potential side effects. 

I am looking to find a new neurologist and I plan to ask them about possibly giving me qulipta for my migraines which apparently has a side effect of weight loss and might also help my IBS. But until then, this is where I'm at. 

Sorry for the novel. If you've made it this far, thanks for taking the time. Any advice or feedback would be much appreciated. I'm feeling pretty defeated, ngl. ",1,1758841736.0,WeightLossAdvice,16,1.0,False
1nqlk1a,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_PremierResearchLabs/comments/1nqlk1a/trying_to_cut_back_on_caffeine_these_natural/,Trying to Cut Back on Caffeine? These Natural Energy Boosters Actually Work,"Caffeine works ‚Äî until it doesn‚Äôt. Over time, that afternoon coffee can lead to energy crashes, disrupted sleep, and rising tolerance that demands more just to feel normal. If you are looking to support energy without the side effects, there are real alternatives that nourish instead of deplete.

Unlike stimulants, natural energy boosters work by supporting the systems that produce energy at the cellular level, improving oxygen use, or reducing fatigue signals from the brain and body.

Here are some of the top options worth knowing about:

**1. Rhodiola rosea-** An adaptogen known for increasing stamina and reducing mental fatigue. It supports stress resilience and may help improve performance under pressure.

**2. Cordyceps mushroom-** Supports oxygen utilization, lung capacity, and ATP production. Great for physical endurance and recovery, especially for athletes or those with low stamina.

**3. CoQ10 and PQQ-** These compounds play a direct role in mitochondrial energy production. They support long-term cellular energy and may help reduce fatigue associated with aging or stress.

**4. B vitamins-** Essential cofactors in energy metabolism. Low levels of B12, B6, or folate can leave you feeling sluggish, even with good sleep and nutrition.

**5. Green tea extract-** Provides a small amount of caffeine balanced by L-theanine, which promotes focus and calm alertness without the jitters or crash.

**6. Magnesium-** Required for ATP synthesis and muscle relaxation. Even mild deficiencies can impact energy, recovery, and sleep quality.

Energy does not always come from stimulation. Often it comes from removing what's draining you and replenishing what your body actually needs to function well. These compounds support energy from the inside out, without creating dependency.

Me!:¬†[https://imgur.com/a/pictures-XdqmQIl](https://imgur.com/a/pictures-XdqmQIl)

Please introduce yourself and show what you look like so I know you're real. <3

A little about me: I'm a nerdier but active person. A bit of a hopeless romantic. I value traditional things like patience, loyalty, and honesty. I'm an honors student going for my Master's in English: Creative Writing. I'm a big mental and physical health advocate. My dream is to be a fantasy author one day, to write stories and characters that help people be inspired by or find comfort in.

What I bring to a relationship: Bookstore, coffee shop, or park dates in person. Home cooked meals. Online we could have calls watching anime, talking, gaming, reading, or anything else interesting! My long-term goal is that I'm considering teaching English in Japan one day. Plus you get my game and book collections AND someone who you can rant about things to.

The woman I'm looking for: You're a kind, loyal woman who shares my values and isn't into hookup culture. You enjoy nerdy things, meaningful talks, and being best friends with their partner. I'm most drawn to someone healthy or athletic, with a sweet face and eyes I can fall for. You want a genuine bond.

Some of my hobbies are writing, gaming, cooking, anime, weightlifting, and long walks in nature. Some major game faves are Final Fantasy, Pok√©mon, NieR:Automata, Baldur's Gate, and pretty much any RPG. I also read (and write) fantasy! Think like Lord of the Rings, Mistborn, but also Star Wars novels. I'd love to find someone to do cosplay with, maybe a Cloud x Tifa/Aerith or something!

I'm in Indiana (EST) and open to online in the US but also in Japan. So if you love calm calls, shared hobbies, and want a lasting connection, please feel free to message. I mainly use discord and will be most active there if we talk. Have a good day.

You know how I was always complaining about my coffee being either too bitter or just tasting like hot water? I finally figured out it wasn't the coffee beans, it was my method. I was just pouring boiling water over grounds in a mug and hoping for the best. A friend saw me doing this and practically staged an intervention.



She introduced me to the French press, and it was a total game-changer. The key was the steeping time. I learned that letting the coffee bloom for about 30 seconds before slowly pouring the rest of the water makes all the difference. Then, a total steep of four minutes‚ÄîI use my phone timer now‚Äîcreates this incredibly smooth and full-bodied cup. The metal filter lets the natural oils through, which is what gives it that rich mouthfeel the paper filters trap.



Here's the cool part I read about: the reason it tastes less acidic is physics. In a drip machine, the water passes through the grounds quickly, extracting the sharper, more acidic compounds first. With a French press, the water and grounds sit together, extracting the flavors more evenly and completely, which mellows everything out. It feels like I‚Äôm actually tasting the coffee instead of just enduring it.



It‚Äôs become this little four-minute ritual in the morning that I genuinely look forward to. My kitchen smells amazing, and I feel like a proper coffee snob in the best way possible. No more sad, weak coffee for me.

Fall in love with the stars when they look at you. Fall in love with the sound of someone breathing. Fall in love with the bus if it‚Äôs on time or the train if it comes early. Fall in love with everything possible.

It was fairly mutual and was over the fact that she didn‚Äôt want to get married again. I got divorced a few years ago and she lost her husband in a military accident. If she got married, she would lose some of the benefits, but we are honestly both doing very well financially.

Within a month of the break up, I connected with a girl who really compliments me. We‚Äôre both getting along really beautifully and we both have a shared vision for the future. I have not told my first girlfriend that I was dating this girl yet.  TBH I didn‚Äôt really intend on dating again for a good six months after our break up, but things happen.

My old girlfriend had been contacting me, wrote a really long letter explaining her feelings and I recently had coffee with her. She told me, in the most defeated way, that she was OK with getting married if that‚Äôs what she had to do. I told her I wouldn‚Äôt make her do that, that I wouldn‚Äôt force that on her. It truly isn‚Äôt what she wants. I think she‚Äôs just telling me that because she‚Äôs going through a lot of pain right now. I‚Äôve been upfront with my new girl about my first girl contacting me, but I feel like the a hole because I threw away her offer quickly. It was mostly because I‚Äôm interested in the new girl and I don‚Äôt believe in forcing the marriage thing with my old girlfriend.",1,1758841273.0,AITA_Relationships,1,1.0,False

I've been on a journey to find the perfect cup of coffee, and let me tell you, the grinder you choose makes a huge difference. After years of using a cheap blade grinder, I finally upgraded to a burr grinder, and wow - what a game-changer!

Let me break down the main differences I've discovered between burr and blade grinders.

Blade grinders are like tiny blenders with spinning blades that chop up your coffee beans. They're usually cheaper, but here's the thing - they create inconsistent grounds. Some pieces end up powder-fine while others stay chunky. This leads to uneven extraction when brewing, which can make your coffee taste bitter or weak.

Burr grinders, on the other hand, work completely differently. They use two abrasive surfaces (the burrs) that crush beans to a consistent size. I recently picked up this amazing burr grinder from https://athometouch.com/coffee-grinder and it's revolutionized my morning coffee routine.

Here's why burr grinders are superior:

1. Consistency - Every particle is virtually the same size
2. Temperature control - Less heat generated during grinding
3. Adjustability - You can precisely select your grind size
4. Flavor - Better extraction means better taste
5. Less waste - No coffee dust or uneven chunks

A common myth is that burr grinders are complicated to use. Trust me, they're not! Mine has simple settings for everything from espresso to French press. The key is getting a quality grinder that'll last for years.

Speaking of quality, I spent weeks researching before finding my current grinder at https://athometouch.com/coffee-grinder. It's been worth every penny - no more bitter coffee or inconsistent brews.

Some tips I've learned:
- Clean your grinder regularly
- Buy whole beans in small batches
- Store beans in an airtight container
- Adjust grind size based on your brewing method
- Don't grind more than you need

The upfront cost of a burr grinder might seem high, but think about it - if you drink coffee daily, you're investing in hundreds of better-tasting cups per year. Plus, you'll save money by making cafe-quality coffee at home.

I love geeking out about coffee gear, so feel free to ask questions in the comments. Whether you're a coffee newbie or a seasoned enthusiast, upgrading your grinder is one of the best ways to improve your coffee game!",1,1758841078.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

1nqla54,https://www.reddit.com/r/CraftFairs/comments/1nqla54/recovering_after_losing_my_weekly_market_spot/,Recovering after losing my weekly market spot,"I had a really sweet spot at a local Saturday craft market geared to tourists, and it rapidly became my primary source of income. It was stressful to keep producing work every week and restock, to the point where all my spare time and creative energy was going into the market. I barely have social media and haven‚Äôt been selling online at all because the market always came first. 

I loved it. I loved having a reason to leave the house every week, meeting new people, having happy excited customers, feeling validated that my work was wanted and valuable. For all the stress it caused it was also incredibly good for my mental health and self worth.

The market owners are older and grumpy, I‚Äôve caught vibes that they don‚Äôt like me very much but I just tried to brush it off and focus on my booth. About three weeks ago a very new vendor who sells the same type of work I do started making complaints about me. They then accused me of telling customers not to buy from them (100% untrue! I‚Äôve gone ou5 of my way to be friendly and point customers to their booth) They had no proof at all but the market owners texted me as I was packed up and driving home and told me they won‚Äôt tolerate bullying and competition and are cutting ties with me, immediately.

I‚Äôve been in shock ever since. I‚Äôm sitting on a mountain of inventory I‚Äôve been churning out for Holiday sales and now have nowhere to sell it. I‚Äôm angry at myself for thinking I was self employed because how could I get fired when I‚Äôm my own boss? 

No one I‚Äôve worked with at the market has reached out, people come and go all the time so I guess they just assumed I got a better job and didn‚Äôt feel like saying goodbye. Which hurts, I want to reach out but know I‚Äôd blurt out what happened and I don‚Äôt want anyone to feel bad about staying at the market, or cause any kind of boycott. There‚Äôs over 30 vendors there who rely on that income (like I did üò≠). The situation is so vague and lacking evidence that I can‚Äôt really speak up or blast them on social media anyway, especially because they‚Äôre so intertwined and respected in the creative community here.

So now what? I tried to find some momentum by applying to new markets, but everything is booked up, crazy high fees, or 2+ hours away. I tried to start photographing everything and listing on Etsy, but it‚Äôs overwhelming; I‚Äôm an awful photographer and I‚Äôm embarrassed about how bad my listings look. And being locked away at home constantly on my phone making sales wasn‚Äôt the point of doing this. I‚Äôve tried emailing and walking in to some local coffee shops to see if they‚Äôd like to host a popup, but found out I need city permits that are $200 and take at least a month for approval. I‚Äôm on a waitlist for some gallery-style spots, but that‚Äôs going to take months.

I‚Äôm so desperate that I‚Äôm tempted to beg for my spot back, but I‚Äôm so hurt by how quickly they dropped me that I just can‚Äôt do it. I showed up without fail every week for almost a year, no matter the weather, no matter how low the foot traffic was. I was loyal and was there for almost a year when most vendors disappear after a month or two. And that didn‚Äôt matter, I was completely disposable. They didn‚Äôt even care enough to wait and discuss it further. I got the text less than an hour after the complaint. 

I‚Äôm just sad. I know I need to be resilient but this really hurts. I structured my whole life around this, finally had my creative outlet, and now because someone lied about me I‚Äôm completely lost. ",8,1758841008.0,CraftFairs,3,1.0,False
1nqla20,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce_Men/comments/1nqla20/separation_woke_me_up_men_carry_it_all_women_cash/,"Separation woke me up: men carry it all, women cash the cheque","[I posted a little while ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/s/xObiyEfVw2) reflecting on some of the upside I‚Äôve experienced since separating. Whilst I‚Äôm continuing to build confidence and continue to bounce back and charge on with improved mental health, and better, more fulfilling relationships, I do find myself being dragged back in the mud to wrestle with the pig that is my ex-wife.

I used to dismiss the ‚Äúman-osphere‚Äù as toxic nonsense. But after my separation, I can‚Äôt deny it: the core of what they say is seemingly right.

For over a decade, I worked myself to the bone to provide. Full-time career, long hours, relentless pressure. My wife? She ‚Äúchose‚Äù part-time work, even though full-time roles were available. Why? Because she wanted the lifestyle. Coffee dates with friends. Long walks and gym/yoga classes. Designer clothes. Expensive homewares. ‚ÄúStatement‚Äù furniture. Big trips and holidays that had to be extraordinary. And of course, the big house on the hill. I didn‚Äôt call it out, I just kept chugging along because I thought that was what a good husband does. ‚ÄúHappy wife, happy life‚Äù.

Meanwhile, I was breaking inside. Mental health shot to pieces. I opened up, acknowledged my flaws, asked for support. I sought individual therapy. I begged for couples counselling. I admitted my bad behaviours and tried to change. She hesitated. Half-heartedly attended therapy. Wouldn‚Äôt talk about intimacy and other hard topics. Wouldn‚Äôt engage.

And the sex? Gone. Once her boxes were ticked ‚Äî the wedding, the reception, the house, the kids ‚Äî it dried up. My needs didn‚Äôt matter anymore.

To be fair, she‚Äôs not evil. She‚Äôs a good mum, cares deeply about the kids, has strong values, and a great community spirit. But when push came to shove, her comfort, her image, and her wants always came before my wellbeing. That‚Äôs not partnership, that‚Äôs extraction.

Now we have separated and work towards divorce the mask has slipped even further. Petty acts, like taking the toilet brushes, the doormats (my garden weed puller!) when she moved out. I‚Äôm still carrying the bills, the responsibility, and the fallout ‚Äî while she rewrites the story of our marriage to cast herself as the saint.

Here‚Äôs the uncomfortable truth: men don‚Äôt just get the short end of the stick in marriage - we are the stick. Society expects us to provide, protect, fix, and sacrifice for everyone else. Women get to choose when and how they engage. They can tap out when it doesn‚Äôt suit them, and the system applauds them for ‚Äúfinding themselves.‚Äù

The man-osphere gets demonised, but strip away the noise and they‚Äôre exposing the imbalance nobody wants to admit. Men are disposable. Our responsibility is mandatory. Women‚Äôs responsibility is optional.

I love my kids. I‚Äôd go through fire for them. But I‚Äôve learned the hard way: for men, marriage is a rigged game. The moment you stop meeting her material or emotional checklist, you‚Äôre either ignored or discarded. And when it ends, you‚Äôre left carrying the can ‚Äî plus the blame.

So yeah, laugh at the man-osphere all you like. I did too. Until life proved them right.
