1lukugd,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1lukugd/help_with_brew/,Help with Brew,"Hi all,

Long time coffee lover and observer, want to know more and be better but have not done much about it yet 😂

Because of work, i generally make 2-3 V60s per week. 

Today, I have had Los Nogales (Colombia, washed, Swevern, Bristol) and tasted very different to yesterday with the only difference that I overtly changed being ration (1:14 yesterday and 1:16.6 today). 

Today’s tasted sour but I don’t think the grind is too fine or was too quick to drawdown and don’t think the water was too cool as it was almost just off the boil. Granted I was distracted by a toddler and he tared my scales mid pour after the bloom but hey - perks of the job!

I definitely would say the end of the cup tasted sour and I want to be better at noticing this because I want to be able to better copy the flavour of a cup I get in a shop (need to start testing different water, I use tap and it’s hard in Bristol) but I’m also not sure my palette is refined to say something is acidic, bitter etc etc…

I have watched a few videos about dialing in coffee before but get a bit lost with it to be honest so any suggestions and help is appreciated. 

I use a gooseneck but don’t have ability to measure water temp. ",1,1751969617.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

His Real Wife Isn’t Me
👉 CONTINUE READING 👈
Chapter 1
It was the third year of Savannah Reed’s marriage to Grayson Whitmore when their marriage license accidentally got soaked and ruined by a spilled cup of coffee.

Savannah brought the damaged license to the City Hall for a replacement.

The clerk typed a few keys in her computer, then suddenly looked up with a puzzled expression.

“Ma’am, according to our system… your marital status is listed as single.”

Savannah froze, thinking she must have misheard.

“That’s impossible. My husband and I got married right here three years ago.”

The clerk double-checked, her expression turning awkward.

“The system shows you as single, but Mr. Whitmore is registered as married…”

She paused.

“His listed spouse is someone named Claire Monroe. Do you know her?”

A sharp ringing filled Savannah’s mind, leaving only a shrill ringing in her ears.

Everyone knew Savannah and Grayson had been childhood sweethearts.

She was the girl he had once called the light of his life—the one he used to protect with quiet devotion.

While Claire Monroe?

Claire was just a stand-in Grayson had found while Savannah was studying abroad because he missed her so much.

Still gripping the ruined license, Savannah numbly got into her car.

Her phone buzzed.

It was a message from Grayson.

“Baby, I skipped out on a billion-dollar deal just to be home early. Got your favorite rose tartlets and strawberry cakes. I miss you so much—do you miss me?”

Savannah stared at the message.

And then, suddenly, she laughed.

The laugh rolled out of her chest like something broken.

And as she laughed, tears spilled silently down her cheeks.

For three years, he had asked her the same question every day.

Had showered her with love and affection.

But behind her, he had already become another woman’s husband.

Memories flashed through her mind—

Grayson, at thirteen, breaking his arm falling from a tree to retrieve her kite.

Yet he still handed her the kite with a smile, saying, “Don’t cry, Sav. It doesn’t even hurt.”

At fifteen, waiting in the rain all night beneath her room, just to be the first to wish her happy birthday.

At eighteen, kneeling under a sky of fireworks in a rented amusement park, whispering, “Marry me when I’m twenty-two, okay?”

At the airport, the day she left for college abroad, eyes red-rimmed as he pinned her to the wall. “Two years. That's all time I'm giving you. When time's up, I'm flying over to take you back.”

During those two years, they video-called almost every night.

Once, she was buried in deadlines and missed his calls for three days.

When she finally reached out, she found out he’d been hospitalized with alcohol poisoning.

In the hospital, he looked into the camera, eyes bloodshot.

“Baby, I can’t live without you.”

She had coaxed him gently, “Just a little longer. I’m coming back soon.”

When she returned, she hadn’t told him. Wanted to surprise him.

But when she opened the private room at The Brambleton Club, she saw him kissing another woman—deeply, desperately.

That woman had the same soft features. The same gentle smile. She looked almost like Savannah.

Her purse dropped to the ground with a thud. She turned and walked out without a word.

Grayson chased after her like a madman. She wouldn’t answer his calls, so he stood in the rain outside her apartment, texting nonstop. Begging.

“It’s not what you think!”

“You didn’t let me come see you—I missed you too much. She was just a replacement…”

“I swear it was only kissing, nothing more!”

“Sav, I’m sorry—I love you so much it’s driving me insane…”

He stood there for three days and nights in the pouring rain. He collapsed from a high fever that turned into pneumonia. Even after being rushed to the hospital, he refused to leave.

Only then did her heart soften, and she forgave him. After that, he treated her with the same devotion as before.

Until after their wedding, when Savannah noticed a new assistant around Grayson. Claire Monroe.

The girl he had sworn he’d sent away.

He explained again, “Her parents are sick. She couldn’t handle being away from home. She begged to come back here…”

“She applied for the assistant position—I didn’t even know it was her.”

“She’s actually pretty good at the job, went through all the screening rounds. I couldn’t just fire her.”

So Savannah tolerated it. Again.

Until one day, she looked up and realized the joke was on her.

By the time her car pulled into the driveway at Everpine Estates, Savannah’s tears had dried.

She inhaled deeply. Just as she reached for the front door, she heard voices from inside the house—Grayson and his friend, Logan.

“I just saw Claire at the hospital,” Logan said. “She’s fine. Just a few scrapes. You can relax and stay home with Savannah.”

Grayson’s voice came next. He was stretched out on the couch, black shirt unbuttoned at the collar, long legs crossed.

“You know the rule,” he said coldly. “No smoking in this house. Savannah hates the smell.”

Logan chuckled. “Man, you are whipped.”

Then, more seriously: “I still don’t get it. You're so obsessed with Savannah. Why’d you even marry Claire? Be honest—was she really just a replacement?”

The room went quiet for a second.

Then Grayson’s voice, low and hoarse: “What if I do?”

“I used to think once Savannah came back, I’d forget all about Claire.”

“But after she left, I kept dreaming about her.”

“I couldn’t tolerate anymore. I brought her back. Gave her a job. Kept her close.”

“I can’t live without Savannah… but I can’t let go of Claire either.”

“Savannah gets all my above-board love. Claire can only stay in the shadows, and I'll give her a title as compensation. That’s fair, isn’t it?”

Logan exhaled. “You know if she discovers this, even you bleed out at her feet she still walks away without looking back.

Grayson was silent.

“Then I’ll just make sure she never finds out.”

Savannah stood frozen on the doorstep. Her blood felt like ice in her veins.

She thought she’d collapse. Break down. But the tears didn’t come.

Because pain like this wasn’t loud. It was silent. It clawed a hole in your heart and left it beating anyway.

She remembered that morning, he had kissed her forehead before heading out the door.

Every time he came home drunk, he’d hold her tightly and whisper, “Baby, I can’t live without you.”

He used to warm her frozen fingers with his own, pressing her hand to his chest. “This heart beats only for you.”

And it was all a lie.

The entire time she was trying to understand, to forgive, to believe in his love.

Now, she saw the truth: he'd just fallen head over heels for two women simultaneously.

He never intended to choose.

He wanted both.

Fine.

Grayson was afraid she’d find out?

Then she’d show him what she will do.

Savannah turned and walked away.

1lukt0h,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1lukt0h/aitah_to_my_husband_snoozing_the_alarm/,AITAH to my husband snoozing the alarm?,"Im 36 weeks pregnant. I work from home, my husband works from home 2 days/week. Im responsible for getting our son to and from camp or school or whatever activity or doctors appointment he has bc my husband is the breadwinner and it makes sense that he focus on his career.

He's a good dad and husband, has been doing things around our place that im too pregnant to do. And I appreciate that. 

However this stage of pregnancy is so difficult. Like im starving but can only eat 2 bites of food bc I have a massive baby in me (95th %, like his 10 lbs + brother) = no energy ever. My entire body hurts from carrying this weight around. I roll around all night long with a combination of heartburn and hip pain. Point is I could really use the whole working from home advantage to sleep in until our son gets up at 7. 

This guy sets his alarm for 5. 5:10. 5:20 - you get the picture. By 5:30 im irate, frustrated, definitely cant get back to sleep. And it's every single day. You know when he finally gets up....? 6:45... can some one please explain to me the reason my husband needs to snooze the alarm for an hour and 45? 

Then he acts all mad at everyone bc he has legit 10 min to leave for work. A tiny window to shower, get in a suit, pack up his stuff and have coffee.  And I've been up for hours, constipated - another lovely pregnancy symptom.

I've asked him politely to please just get up and he yells at me saying - I'll just sleep somewhere else. Like thanks, use fear of abandonment at 9 months pregnant to make me feel like an ungrateful b*tch. 

I know hes tired too, but am i the asshole for expecting him to get up when he sets HIS alarm??

Touchdown at Schiphol. Sorted the OV-chipkaart at the station – dead easy. Straight onto a train to Centraal (quicker than the Piccadilly Line, frankly). Dumped my bag at the hostel near Dam Square. Right, priorities: frites from Manneken Pis (went full Dutch with mayo, obviously) and started wandering the Jordaan. Got gloriously lost down narrow lanes, over humpback bridges, past gabled houses leaning like tipsy uncles. Did a canal cruise – touristy, yes, but seeing the city from the water makes sense of it all. Evening vibes in De Pijp: street food at Albert Cuyp Market (managed a stroopwafel without wearing it), then found a cosy brown cafe. Solo pub rule: smile, make eye contact, chat ensues. Easy. Crashed early, knackered but buzzing.

Day 2: Giethoorn's Fairytale Quiet  
Up early! Train from Centraal to Steenwijk (grabbed a coffee, admired the Dutch countryside whizzing by – flat, obviously). Quick bus hop to Giethoorn. Blimey. Felt like walking onto a film set. No roads, just emerald canals, thatched cottages, and ducks giving me the side-eye. Rented an electric whisper boat – solo mission! Got a quick lesson (""Left is right, right is left? Cheers, mate."") and puttered off. Absolute bliss. Gliding silently under wooden bridges, past gardens bursting with flowers, only the putt-putt of the motor. Found a spot, switched off, just... quiet. Heaven. Wandered the footpaths after, scoffed a massive pannenkoek (bacon and cheese, proper fuel). Back to Amsterdam by evening, feeling properly chuffed.

1lukoyw,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lukoyw,My review of the Lattafa Vol. 1 Discovery set,"Hello everyone! I stumbled across a tiktok promoting the Lattafa vol. 1 discovery set and had to buy it simply to try ""Her confession""! Been wanting to try it for so long! And ofc i was curious for the other ones. I bought it on Notino (germany) for around 11€ on sale. Got it today! So here is my review:

(I'm going to go in the same order as pictured, so to not confuse people)

1. His confession :
Definitely a very beautiful scent! At first it smelled like a generic mid range Men's perfume but changed into this very beautiful incense. The incense is similar to that one big brand called ""Wildberry incence"". It basically smelled like you passed a dude standing infront of those incense lol. Its definitely something I really like, so in my shopping cart it goes (number 3 out of the 6)

2. Her confession :
The main reason I got this set and I am SO happy I did. Its such a gorgeous smell! At first it was very creamy and smelled like a very good tea i had before. So basically tea with milk lol and than it developed into this gorgeous incense smell the same way ""His confessions"" did but even better. This is definitely in my top ultimate favorite scents and I keep smelling it on me as I'm typing this. I am in love with it and going to buy the full bottle asap (number 1 out of the 6)

3. Teriaq :
Do NOT buy this if you hate the candy licorice!! This smells EXACTLY like the Haribo licorice candy rolls. Awful. I hate this smell. My husband loves it BECAUSE he loves the candy but not me I'm sorry. Definitely beware (number 6 out of the 6)

4. Angham :
What Burberry tried to do with Burberry Goddess but Lattafa actually did it right. I've been hating on Burberry goddess since it was released because the ginger note in it is so overpowering. All I smell is ginger and I hate it. I tried to love it bc so many people do but I couldn't. Lattafa did it right tho! The ginger is well blended and its not too much but enough to give the perfume a ""spice"" or ""sharpness"" to it. Now THIS is what I believe Burberry goddess supposed to smell like and I get the hype now. Definitely adding this to my cart too ( number 4 out of the 6)

5. Ajayeb Dubai :
A perfect Autumn perfume! It literally smells like you're at a bakery/ coffee shop drinking coffee while the crispy leafs are falling to the ground and you're all cozy. I didnt expect to like this that much! I barely see people talking about this. As someone obsessed with Autumn, this is a must have. Also smells like bath & body works ""pumpkin pecan waffles"" without the pumpkin and coffee instead.
( number 2 out of the 6)

6. Al Nashama :
There isn't much to say honestly. It smells very generic. Like a mid range generic men's perfume. Its not the best but not the worst. Just not going to buy it bc I already have scents like that. (Number 5 out of the 6)

I highly recommend buying this set! Its very lovely and cheap. Lattafa also have a vol. 2 which I'm planning on buying too ",2,1751969040.0,Perfumes,1,1.0,False

This isn’t depression. Not a tragedy. Just a quiet, persistent feeling that I exist — but I’m not like the others.
Not like the ones who succeed, who move forward, who attract people, who are listened to. I watch them — from outside.

I have two friends.
One has been with me since birth — our parents are close.
The other — since fifth grade.
But both of them are the type people choose. They shine.
I’m always nearby, but never in the center. They text only on holidays or when we bump into each other. I feel like a shadow in their lives.
And I know they’re not cruel. They just have something I don’t — energy, charisma, gravity.
I have silence.

In sixteen years, I haven’t formed a single new, real friendship.

⸻

I don’t have hobbies.
Turns out, other people have been doing things all this time — dancing, drawing, coding, clubs.
And I guess I was… there too. Somewhere. Doing something. But now, looking back, there’s nothing left in my hands.

I’m not great at anything.
Not at school, not at extracurriculars, not in life.
I’m not particularly smart.
Not especially pretty.
Mostly, I just feel invisible.

I’m not someone. Just… here.

⸻

My family is simple. And complicated.
We’re not poor — we have an apartment, a car.
We run a little coffee shop. My mom, my sister and I take shifts.
My mom never says no to me. I can ask for food, for little things, and she always finds the money.

But I know where that money comes from.
I see her spending nothing on herself.
My dad often has 100 tenge — sometimes 200 — on his card. That’s it.
Because all the earnings go to mom’s card, to reorder supplies, pay bills, run the business.

And me? I ordered pizza for 3,500.
While they were maybe choosing between cheese and eggs.
And I hated how that felt.

It’s not about the money.
It’s about the constant dull ache of watching my parents live in pause mode.
They’re tired.
Always below average. Always “barely enough.” Always sacrificing.
And that feeling — it’s been with me since I was small.

⸻

Recently, they spent 3 million tenge on stock.
Something went wrong. It won’t sell.
They won’t get the money back.
I don’t think they’re stupid.
But I can see that the world is moving faster than they are.
There’s ChatGPT, digital businesses, new systems.
And we have… a coffee shop. And boxes of unsold cookies.

⸻

My dad told me my mom wants him to go abroad.
Pick fruit, send money home. Pay the debts.
He said, “If I go, I might not come back.”
I don’t know what he meant. Death? Escape? Just fear?

I couldn’t look at him.
I stared at the floor, tears behind my eyes, throat closing.
He said, “You and your sister need to help now. Learn how to earn. Use those AIs.”

And all I could think was:

But don’t I have a life too?
Aren’t I still a child?
Why does this burden belong to me now?

⸻

And so here I am.
Afraid to talk to people — because no one ever really wanted to be close.
Unsure I’ll pass exams — because I’m not one of the smart ones.
Uncertain about the future — because it just looks darker every year.

They keep saying: “Decide. Think. Plan.”
And inside me, I’m screaming: “Don’t you think I’ve been thinking this whole time?”

⸻

I’m not complaining.
I’m just looking for even a flicker of meaning.
Just a hint of belief that life isn’t just obligation and slow collapse.

Maybe for others it’s different.
Or maybe it’s exactly the same — they just never say it out loud.
But I did.
Even if just like this.

“Are you just going to ignore me the whole day?” asked Kylie, steering the Jeep down the dusty forest road. “I asked you to drive, it’s your car. Don’t act like I stole it, dude.”

Blake shook his head, still staring out through his window. The interaction with the warden earlier wasn’t bad, actually. The man didn’t give him shit for being a failure, nor did he treat him like a criminal. Nah, that was a great experience for sure.

They drank coffee and chatted as Kylie fried up some bacon and pancakes, just talking about everything and nothing. Blake had to admit, the annoying little thief was a phenomenal cook. Fuck no, he didn’t tell her that. The warden did, though.

“Shut it, please?” he asked, grabbing the door to keep his face from smashing the door. “And slow down, damn.”

Kylie rolled her eyes, but downshifted to a stop. Checking for cross traffic, she gunned it, giggling as the V8 engine roared to life. 

“Oh my gosh, this thing is healthy!” she gushed, shifting to the next gear with ease. “Did you buy it like this?”

“Built it,” he mumbled, reclining his seat as much as he could.

“No way!” Kylie glanced at him, but had to focus on the twisting road guiding them from the canyon. “Is it a 350 or something?”

Blake raised a brow, curious about how the hell her type would know anything about engines. “No, a 283 Chevy. Fits better in the engine bay.”

She was fit to burst, with both hands clutching the wheel and back straight, all attention on the road. 

“I love it, Blake. Thanks for letting me drive, it’s the best!”

“Uh-huh.”

***

They drove west, winding down the mountain until they reached the next mountain town off of Highway 4. Kylie pulled into the shopping center, stopping in front of the pharmacy. Pulling the keys from the ignition, she pushed her door open, frowning when the July heat met her skin.

“Come on, big guy.” She fixed her sun dress, smoothing the front. “Out, let's go.”

Blake shot her a quizzical look. “For what? I have zero business in there and no money.”

Kylie sighed, shaking out her hair. “I need my prescription, and you sir, cannot be alone right now. Come on, move out, cowboy!”

“I'm good, not going anywhere.” He yawned, fixing his position in the seat. “Go ahead, I'll wait.”

***

Prescription in hand, Kylie gave the cashier a hurried, “thanks!”, and rushed outside. She had absolutely no idea if Blake would be in the car, or if he snuck away. No.

No, he wasn't there, not in that state of mind at the moment. She stood on the sidewalk, staring at him through the dusty windshield while he reckoned in the seat, head back and mouth open, snoring away peacefully. To her right, just down the sidewalk there in the shopping center, the smell of savory pizza wafted from the open door.

Not wanting to wake him since she knew all too well that sleep was the ultimate medicine… she went on in to the restaurant to order a pie. But that wasn't it, oh hell no. There was twenty minutes until it’d be done, and discovering Blake's 12 volt portable fridge, the urge to fill it couldn't be shook.

Luckily the grocery store had a public restroom as well. Her prescription had been ignored for the last week, causing her hormones to spin out of wack. So, slapping a fresh patch on her thigh and draining the bladder, she hurried to grab some fresh produce and meat before retrieving that pizza.

***

“Who the fuck-” Blake shot up in his seat when the door of his Jeep swung open. “Oh, it's just you,” he yawned. 

Kylie stood outside, two plastic bags hanging from one wrist and a flat box in her hands. Grinning, she passed him the pie, then flipped her seat forward to access the fridge.

“Just me, buddy.” Packing the fridge full of meats, veggies, and some dairy, a beep sounded when Blake pushed the plug into the outlet. “Thank you, kind sir!”

“Yeah,” he said, tone neutral. “Is this a pizza?”

“Uh-huh, half veggie, half pepperoni.” She closed the lid on the fridge and pushed her seat back, climbing in. “I don't know your preference, so I got us some options.”

He nodded, lifting the box lid to peek inside. “Cool.”

“Ranch is in the fridge.” Kylie started the engine, giving him an appraising look. “How was the nap?”

Nothing but a shrug.

“Good! I really appreciate you not sneaking away.” Pulling onto the highway, she pointed them east again, rumbling up into the mountains once more. “So I don't want to go back to the lake - obvious reasons. Have you ever been to Mono Lake?”

“Nah.”

“Me neither.” She fixed her hair with a hand, the other resting lightly on the wheel. “My Papa said it is one of the most beautiful areas in the state and I always wanted to see it for myself.”

“Okay.”

“Are you hungry? We can pull over to eat if you're feeling it.” She stole a quick look, still focused on keeping the Jeep straight, its big tires liking to wander. “At least one slice, keep your energy up.”

“Kylie,” he sighed. 

He didn't want to eat, definitely wasn't keen on traveling, and really wanted to sleep for the rest of his days. However, the stupid annoying scrawny woman was adamant about keeping him around. Why? Who knows 

“Blake,” she mimicked, smirking. “Half a slice, please?” She reached behind her, pulling a bottle of cola from the back seat. “Saw this brand of empties in your trash bag. Will it help wash down the food?”

Was she trying to seduce him, or what? Seriously, nobody had ever paid this amount of attention to him, not even his ex wife when they “loved” each other. Hell, the bitch couldn't even be bothered to pick him up from the mental hospital years back.

Okay, his daughter loved him. Did she still, or did Jessica fill her little mind with lies? God, just the thought of it hurt. What he would give just to hug her one more time.

“Blake, oh, are you alright?” Kylie asked, voice full of concern. 

“Fine,” he choked out, wiping his eyes. “Don't worry about it.”

“No, you tell me, really,” she insisted. “Keeping things-”

“I said, no!” he snapped.

Kylie jumped, clutching the wheel tighter. “Not today, then,” she whispered. 

After an hour of driving with the radio on low, Kylie tried again. Blake rested his head against his window, quietly finishing his second slice of pizza.

“Can I tell you about myself? You won't have to say anything if you don't want.”

He remained silent, eyes fixed on the front window. Maybe it was a yes?

“So before, I told you that my Papa once forced me to stay put, only allowed to wander where he could see me.” She slowed for a bend in the road. “It was because of what I wanted to do, or I suppose, tried to do.”

Kylie paused, checking Blake's reaction. None that she could tell. Not yet.

“I was twelve, just starting puberty I guess. Things… something in me never quite felt right, but it got worse at that age. As a kid, before twelve, I didn't like things that I was supposed to.”

“Normal,” Blake grunted, wiping his hands clean with a napkin. “So what?”

“So I tried telling my parents over the years, but of course my mother told me to get over it.” She scowled at the memory. “The bad feelings got so bad, like, I hated looking at myself in the mirror and my body wasn't mine.”

Blake looked her over for a second, but made no comment. Kylie swallowed hard, eyes misting.

“We lived on a cattle ranch, my Papa's. In the field, we had a very old barn that was like, almost falling down.” She sucked in a shaky breath. “I assumed it would be the perfect, quiet spot to… to do it.

But when I carried some of my dad's rope out there, Papa was already there. His tractor broke down and he was fixing it.”

Kylie wiped at her eyes, sniffing some. Blake stared.

“He saw what I was carrying and - and all he did was talk to me like it was a normal afternoon,” she said with a laugh. “But he knew, somehow.”

“Huh, okay.” Blake adjusted himself in the seat, finding a more comfortable position. “So you gave up?”

“I didn't have the option, Blake! He stuck by me like red on a tomato, never let me out of his sight until I told him why I was out there that day.” She lowered her voice. “And then he took me to the doctor.”

“Yeah, I've been there,” Blake said, clearly not interested. “Mental hospital, shrinks, meds, you name it.”

Kylie nodded. “Me, too. That's when I was diagnosed.”

“Bipolar?” asked Blake. “Schizophrenia, chronic depression, what?”

“I'm transgender,” Kylie said, shifting uncomfortably in her seat. “Dysphoria, that's why I never felt right.”

“Oh, bullshit,” he groaned, rolling his eyes. “You look nothing like that, spare me the crap. You honestly think some made up fake story will help me somehow?”

Kylie set her jaw with a shrug. “If that's what you want to think, then fine. But I'm not lying, and yes, I thought my real story might at least show you that I do know what you are going through.”

“You have no clue what I've dealt with in my life, lady!”

“Maybe not detail my minute detail, but the depression that holds you down like a lead blanket?” She barked out a harsh laugh. “So exhausted from simply breathing, no energy to care if you live or die, wanting it all to fucking stop so you can hopefully scrape up a moment of peace?”

“It's not-”

“No please, tell me more about how your feelings are so rare and unique!” Kylie shouted. “How we got to that point doesn't matter, Blake! It's the now, the thick, sticky funk that pulls you closer to the false promises of escape!”

“Fuck you,” he mumbled, laying on the door again. 

“Keep telling it that,” Kylie said, sniffing again. “Tell it to fuck off, because I'm not letting it get you.”

1lukkcu,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawyerAdvice/comments/1lukkcu/confused_on_what_constitutes_as_working_for_a/,Confused on what constitutes as working for a boss to benefit from a tip pool?,"i tried reading about it but im just confused. a boss/employer/manager cannot benefit from a tipped pool unless tipped services were rendered. so if my boss worked the coffee machine while in the building, she can be tipped?

does this apply to every day or only days they work?

we don’t get tipped out from the tip jars, ever. my manager from the past told me the tips were saved for a “staff party” that, now thinking about it, only the owners and the managers would benefit from since employees get shifted around constantly

and no, to my knowledge i never signed a document stating i consent to having no tips from the tip jar in favor of a “staff party”

is this worth reporting to someone or am i unaware of what it takes to run a business… the tip part specifically confuses me. they literally take the bills out and put them  in a jar behind the counter. never pass them out to us and as far as i know, doesn’t reflect on our paychecks (i also cant access the system to look at my paychecks, they didn’t give me the log in info)",1,1751968555.0,LawyerAdvice,1,1.0,False

1lukjd5,https://www.reddit.com/r/pchelp/comments/1lukjd5/biosmotherboard_bricked_but_pc_still_working/,Bios/motherboard bricked but PC still working?,"Was initially looking at replacing the motherboard but perhaps there is a way around it since I just discovered the machine actually boots into an OS...

  
So, in short:

I have a Legion T7 tower-computer.

I am trying to install a OS and start using it after having it in a closet for a year. However I try on boot, spamming F1,F2,F8,F10,F12,del,escape etc etc I just get a black screen.

I've been trying to clear cmos with the 3 pins ""clear cmos"" moving the pin over and back (and powering it on while it's on the reset/clear position), removing the battery for a couple minutes etc.  
I had resolved to the motherboard being broken.

However, since I had to start opening it up etc I replaced the disk with a different NVMe-disk that has an old windows installation and booted it, went for coffee, and came back fairly surprised to look at a windows boot/login screen. I could login... the machine works(?).

I have kept trying to boot into bios or get a boot-menu up so i can boot from a USB-stick and install my OS on it, but it's just a black screen unless I let it run for 1-2 minutes and then get windows login.  
I get no ""legion"" / boot graphics on boot, it's black until windows login.

I did just discover I can spam F2 on boot, get a black screen, but then press F9 or F10 and press enter (I think this is the quit without saving and quick with saving options), and that reboots the machine... so it seems to be a graphical issue with the machine ACTUALLY being in bios boot?

  
Does anyone have any suggestions on how I can actually manage to:

  
a) boot into bios... somehow.

b) at least boot from a usb to install an OS.

  
since I CAN enter the windows installation I could run any type of bios-tool. The only one I've tested was the bios-update from lenovo that didnt work (It just stops with some error messages, I gave it 5 minutes but it was late and I kinda gave up).",1,1751968446.0,pchelp,1,1.0,False

*Alt text: Professional business people collaborating in a corporate setting.* company here, the answer surprised me. The legal environment had shifted. When I visited the Ministry of Industry & Commerce (MOICT) in the Diplomatic Area, I saw stacks of paperwork—much of it from solo founders like myself. But is it really that straightforward in 2025? Below is a complete, experience-based walkthrough.

## Bahrain Company Formation: 2025 Scene

![Feature Image: Business environment in modern setting](https://images.pexels.com/photos/325185/pexels-photo-325185.jpeg)
*Alt text: Business environment in modern setting.* and [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/bahrains-non-oil-growth-forecast-2025/). With GDP growth forecast at *4.2% into 2025*, the kingdom remains the Gulf’s most pro-entrepreneur regulatory environment. The Economic Development Board (EDB) reports over 6,500 new commercial registrations in Q1 alone, a trend fueled by international founders and solo operators.

Importantly, Bahrain’s business culture blends modern efficiency with deep-rooted traditions—majlis-style meetings are just as common as Zoom calls. While the UAE and Saudi Arabia set high bars for foreign investment, Bahrain offers even more flexibility on ownership, licensing, and capital requirements (see [99% foreign ownership in Bahrain](https://keylinkbh.com/99percent-foreign-ownership-in-bahrain/)).

Ramadan brings unique business rhythms—shorter working hours, more networking over coffee—or gahwa—in the lobby of the Ritz-Carlton or the conference halls at Seef Mall.

## Can a Single Person Form a WLL Company in Bahrain? (Short Answer)

**Yes**—as of the 2025 regulatory update, a single individual can register and own a WLL (With Limited Liability) company in Bahrain. The process has never been more accessible for solo founders, including non-residents and foreign nationals.

But, there are technicalities you must understand. WLLs (akin to LLCs elsewhere) used to require two or more shareholders. However, new MOICT guidelines (Circular 8/2025, effective 1 March 2025) allow a sole founder to establish a ""Single Person Company WLL"" (SPC-WLL), provided they comply with the latest Sijilat portal documentation and capital requirements.

*I once almost submitted a dual-shareholder application out of old habit, only to be redirected by an LMRA officer who’d already processed three successful single-person WLLs that morning!*

For founders—especially foreigners—this change slashes both bureaucracy and partner risk. See [foreigner-friendly activities and 100% ownership](https://keylinkbh.com/foreigner-friendly-activities-100percent-ownership-allowed-for-foreigner/) for a full list of eligible business activities.

## Bahrain Business Entity Types: Key Differences

![Feature Image: Business structure and collaboration](https://images.pexels.com/photos/1181406/pexels-photo-1181406.jpeg)
*Alt text: Business structure and collaboration.*:** Now available as a Single Person Company (SPC-WLL). Most flexible for SMEs and solo consultants.
- **SPC (Single Person Company):** Structurally similar to the new SPC-WLL, with some differences in permitted activities.
- **BSC (Bahrain Shareholding Company):** Suitable for larger ventures; requires multiple shareholders.
- **Branch Office:** Extension of a foreign parent; no independent legal status.
- **Free Zone Company:** For export-driven businesses or tech startups; see [Bahrain free zones](https://keylinkbh.com/free-zones-in-bahrain/).

More entity details: [Bahrain business type structures](https://keylinkbh.com/bahrain-business-type-structures/).

**My firm opinion:** For most solo entrepreneurs or consultants, the new SPC-WLL model provides the fastest, safest, and most cost-effective entry route.

### Bahrain’s WLL vs. UAE and Saudi Arabia

- *WLLs in Bahrain now allow 100% foreign and single-person ownership, even outside free zones—something that remains more restricted in the UAE mainland and Saudi.*
- Business setup fees and renewal costs are significantly lower than in Dubai or Riyadh, especially if you know the right shortcuts (more on saving money soon).

## Formation Process: Step-by-Step with Insider Tips

![Feature Image: Business process and documentation](https://images.pexels.com/photos/669610/pexels-photo-669610.jpeg)
*Alt text: Business process and documentation.*.
- Reserve your trade name online; check eligibility for WLL or SPC-WLL.
- **Insider tip:** Early mornings (8:00-10:00am, especially Tuesdays) see the shortest queues both online and at the MOICT desk in Seef Mall.

### Step 2: Prepare Documents
- Passport copy (and, if resident, CPR ID).
- Lease agreement for physical office (virtual offices are accepted for many activities as of June 2025).
- Business plan (brief for most activities).
- Bank reference letter.

*A personal aside: In 2023, I wasted two days chasing notarized office lease documents. Now, the Sijilat portal accepts unsigned draft leases for initial approval—saving at least 48 hours!*

### Step 3: Apply Via Sijilat
- Upload all documents.
- Pay the registration fee (starting from BHD 65).
- Track application status daily; if it’s still “Under Review” after 3 days, call the MOICT hotline or—better (my pro tip)—visit the main counter in the Diplomatic Area just before closing (1:30pm), when staff are eager to clear the day’s queue.

### Step 4: Open Company Bank Account
- Major banks in Bahrain Bay (Bank ABC, BisB, Ahli United Bank) process SME accounts faster than those in Manama’s older business district.
- **Time-saver:** Book your account meeting for just after lunchtime, when bank queues thin out.

### Step 5: Finalize Labor Market Authority (LMRA) Steps & Receive CR
- Complete LMRA registration if you plan to hire staff.
- Receive your Commercial Registration (CR) within 5-10 business days.
- *If you operate as a solo consultant, LMRA steps are minimal. Tamkeen offers free advisory sessions for first-time founders.*

**Full process details:** [Bahrain company formation process](https://keylinkbh.com/bahrain-company-formation-process/) and [commercial registration in Bahrain](https://keylinkbh.com/commercial-registration-in-bahrain/).

> **Insider shortcut:** Always bring extra passport-size photos and keep soft copies (PDF + JPEG) of all scanned documents—MOICT requests unpredictable extra “copies” at least twice during CR processing.

## Costs & Budgeting for Solo WLL Setups

![Feature Image: Financial planning and costs](https://images.pexels.com/photos/4386375/pexels-photo-4386375.jpeg)
*Alt text: Financial planning and costs.*:**
- MOICT Application Fee: **BHD 65–100** (approx. USD 170–265)
- Trade Name Reservation: **BHD 25–50**
- Office Lease (virtual): **BHD 300–600/year** in Seef, less in Juffair; physical offices start from **BHD 1,200/year**
- Legal setup/attestation: **BHD 70–250** (factor in additional notarization charges if you want to avoid future amendments)
- Annual renewal: **BHD 80–150**
- Bank capital requirements: minimum **BHD 50** (for most solo WLLs, raised in March 2025 from BHD 20)

**Recommended budget:** Set aside **BHD 800–1,500** for complete registration, rent, and first-year fees for a virtual-office, no-staff SPC-WLL.

> **Save money:** Use a virtual office lease to cut overhead, and check out [Bahrain company formation cost](https://keylinkbh.com/bahrain-company-formation-cost/) for the latest fees and discount offers from local providers.

*Common mistake: Budgeting for one year of licensing but forgetting to account for mandatory accounting and annual audits (see below for compliance).*

---
## Compliance, Tax, and Accounting: 2025 Requirements

![Feature Image: Legal compliance and documentation](https://images.pexels.com/photos/4427616/pexels-photo-4427616.jpeg)
*Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation.* introduced a new VAT compliance notification service (March 2025). This makes it easier to avoid late filing fines.

- No corporate income tax on most business categories.
- VAT (10%) applies to many activities—register if turnover exceeds BHD 37,500.
- Must maintain books and annual returns even for zero activity.

My strong advice? Use a specialist service for routine filings. [Accounting and bookkeeping services in Bahrain](https://keylinkbh.com/accounting-and-bookkeeping-services-in-bahrain/) can automate most compliance at low monthly rates. I once missed a VAT filing deadline (during Eid, offices closed early)—since then, I haven’t handled my own statutory filings.

## Navigating Challenges: Top Mistakes & How to Avoid Them

![Feature Image: Professional business support and consultation](https://images.pexels.com/photos/7097/pexels-photo-7097.jpg)
*Alt text: Professional business support and consultation.* before proceeding.
* Underestimating the time needed for bank account opening.
* Not preparing correct lease documentation. Virtual offices are allowed for many activities, but not all (especially in fintech, which may require approval from the EDB).
* Skipping required annual compliance filings.
* Misunderstanding local sponsorship requirements—unnecessary for most WLLs, but still required for some regulated activities ([Local sponsorship in Bahrain](https://keylinkbh.com/local-sponsorship-in-bahrain/)).

> The first time I attended a majlis-style business meeting in Manama, I wore a navy suit—only to find everyone else dressed in relaxed national attire, shoes-off, enjoying traditional qahwa. That informal networking led to a faster CR approval. Relationships matter in Bahrain.

**Pro tip:** Attend a Tamkeen SME clinic or pop by the EDB office in Bahrain Bay to get *free guidance* on minimizing paperwork. And always respect the local custom of receiving coffee with your right hand during meetings (trust me, details matter).

## 2025 Regulatory Update: What Changed?

Surprisingly, the most impactful 2025 change is *Circular 8/2025*, which officially allows full single-person ownership of WLLs—even for foreigners, with nearly all commercial activities included. Previously, only specific activities were SPC-eligible. Now, the majority of activities—including consultancy, trading, and IT—are open.

**Implementation date:** 1 March 2025
**Practical implication:** No more need for a local partner or nominee shareholder—cutting both risk and complexity. As a result, more foreign founders are bypassing UAE free zones in favor of Bahrain’s open mainland setup.

Official policy link: [Bahrain.com regulations](https://www.bahrain.com/business-setup/company-formation/).

## Unexpected Tangent: The Power of Ramadan Networking

During the holy month, routines—and business practices—shift: government counters open earlier, but close by 2pm, while the best networking happens during iftar events. The *Bahrain Chamber of Commerce* and Seef district hotels host free mixers. One year, I met a key government contact over a surprise majlis at the InterContinental who untangled a Sijilat portal issue for me in days.

This story matters: building your Bahraini network—no matter how solo your company—remains the fastest way to save time, clarify regulatory roadblocks, and grow a local client base.

---
## Single-Owner WLLs: Advantages & Nuanced Drawbacks

**Pros:**
* 100% ownership—even for foreigners
* No minimum share capital (for most activities)
* Fastest registration process, especially when using the Sijilat portal and virtual offices
* No need for a local partner or sponsor

**Cons:**
* Some regulated sectors (like banking or insurance) still require CBB approval or local partnership
* Annual audit and VAT compliance—even for zero-staff startups
* Certain activities (especially professional services) may require additional professional qualifications

**My advice?** For most solo entrepreneurs, freelancers, and digital consultants, the SPC-WLL structure in Bahrain is the ideal balance of flexibility and protection.

---
## Recommended Resources & Service Providers

- **Keylink Bahrain:** [company formation](https://keylinkbh.com/company-formation-in-bahrain/) and [cost breakdown](https://keylinkbh.com/bahrain-company-formation-cost/)
- **Tamkeen:** Free business advisory for new founders
- **MOICT Helpdesk:** Seef Mall counter, for face-to-face troubleshooting
- **Sijilat Portal:** [Official online CR registration](https://www.bahrain.com/)
- **Accounting Services:** [Automated compliance support](https://keylinkbh.com/accounting-and-bookkeeping-services-in-bahrain/)

My strongest recommendation: work with a service provider who has *physical presence* in Seef or Diplomatic Area to avoid paperwork delays. I recovered three lost days simply because my agent had a pre-existing relationship with the Sijilat processing team!

## FAQ: Solo WLLs in Bahrain

### 1. **Can a foreigner own 100% of a WLL (SPC-WLL) in Bahrain?**
Yes, as of March 2025, foreign nationals can own 100% of a WLL (SPC-WLL) across almost all business activities, without needing a local sponsor. More details: [foreigner-friendly activities](https://keylinkbh.com/foreigner-friendly-activities-100percent-ownership-allowed-for-foreigner/) and [99% foreign ownership in Bahrain](https://keylinkbh.com/99percent-foreign-ownership-in-bahrain/).

### 2. **How much does it cost to register a solo WLL company?**
Expect to pay around BHD 800–1,500 for full setup, including all government fees, lease, and basic compliance. Specific fee breakdown: [Bahrain company formation cost](https://keylinkbh.com/bahrain-company-formation-cost/).

### 3. **Do I need a physical office?**
No—for most activities, a virtual office lease is sufficient. However, certain sectors (like finance or regulated consultancy) require a physical presence. For office rules, see [Bahrain company formation process](https://keylinkbh.com/bahrain-company-formation-process/).

### 4. **Can I open my company in a free zone for extra benefits?**
Yes—free zones offer tax incentives and 100% foreign ownership (also available on the mainland via WLL), but require a different licensing process. See [Bahrain free zones](https://keylinkbh.com/free-zones-in-bahrain/).

### 5. **What are the annual compliance steps?**
- Annual audit (mandatory since 2025)
- VAT registration (if turnover exceeds BHD 37,500)
- Annual CR renewal and MOICT filings
Outsource these to [accounting and bookkeeping services](https://keylinkbh.com/accounting-and-bookkeeping-services-in-bahrain/) for peace of mind.

---

**Final Expert Word:**
Bahrain’s 2025 reforms have made solo entrepreneurship easier, faster, and safer than ever before. A single person—local or foreign—can now launch a WLL company and access the Gulf’s most founder-friendly market. Focus on preparing your documents, leveraging virtual offices, and building relationships in the Seef or Diplomatic Area. If you want to skip queues and sidestep the old paperwork maze, follow these steps and you’ll enjoy Bahrain’s uniquely open business landscape—one where tradition, modernity, and opportunity blend every day.

Six months ago, my business newsletter felt like screaming into a void. I had about **12,000 subscribers**, but you know what? Barely **8%** were opening my emails. Click-throughs? Pathetic. Sales? Trickling in at best.

I was this close to deleting half my list because every “expert” told me dead subscribers just kill your deliverability. But something about that felt so wrong — I mean, these people *signed up* once. They *cared* once. So I figured: before I blow it up, why not try to wake it up?



**What I Tried First (And Why It Failed)**

Like any clueless marketer, I blasted a generic “We Miss You!” email. No segmentation, no personalization. Results? Brutal. A handful opened it. No one clicked. I realized I was treating these people like a mass blob — not humans.



**Where Betaitsolution’s Mailer Came In**

I stumbled on a re-engagement guide from **Betaitsolution** — they have this tool called **Mailer** that basically *thinks* for you. It doesn’t just do regular email blasts; it builds AI-powered segments and sends different messages to different people, based on how *dead* they are.

So, here’s what I did:

* I imported my list into Mailer.  
* It grouped people into buckets: ghost openers, clickers who stopped buying, and total zombies.  
* For each group, it built a short re-engagement flow — super short, like 3–5 emails.  





# The Secret Sauce: Making It Human

The best thing? The content wasn’t spammy discounts. It was real:

* For long-time ghosts, I wrote a plain text email, like I’d write a friend: *“Hey, you probably don’t even remember me. That’s on me. Here’s what I’ve been working on, and here’s something just for you — no catch.”*  
* For people who abandoned a cart months ago, it sent a reminder — *“You were so close. Want 10% off? Here’s your link.”*  
* For my “almost buyers”, it sent a micro-survey — *“What do you want to see from me?”*  

I wasn’t begging. I was inviting. And the AI handled all the heavy lifting: timing, subject line tweaks, even the best day to send.



**What Actually Happened**

Two weeks in, my open rates doubled. But the real win? People replied. Like *actual people* — *“Hey, love that you reached out. Here’s why I stopped reading…”* Those replies turned into product tweaks, better offers, and guess what? By the end of month three, I didn’t just get engagement — I closed **20% more sales** than when I was paying for cold leads.



**My Big Takeaway**

Look — if you’re reading this and you’ve got a dead email list, do *not* write it off. Don’t throw money at new ads until you’ve tried re-engaging who you already have. But don’t half-ass it with generic spam either.

Tools like **Mailer** from **Betaitsolution** basically give you a “smart second chance.” They don’t just blast — they *listen*. It felt like having a mini copywriter, data analyst, and psychologist in one.



**If You Want My Advice**

* Treat every dormant subscriber like a person who *once* trusted you.  
* Use AI to personalize, but keep the tone *human*.  
* Make your message feel like a coffee chat, not a pitch.  
* Test tiny offers. Reward them for giving you another shot.  

Seriously — my only regret is not doing this sooner. Your “dead list” is just a bunch of future buyers waiting for you to show up *like a real human*, not a robot. And if you want to do it right, check out **Betaitsolution’s Mailer** — it honestly saved my business’s email game.

Got this seller Sunny’s digits from my girl Jess (shoutout to the plug 🙌). Hit him up on WP– dude replies fast AF. Sent me a fuckton of bag pics/vids like a damn museum curator. Knew I wanted that brown bowling bag IMMEDIATELY – low-key flex but won’t scream ""ROB ME"" in downtown LA.

Hi everyone!

I'm an incoming graduate student at American University, originally from India. I’ve been working as an academic researcher for the past five years and will be joining AU as a research assistant this fall.

I’ll be moving to DC around August 10th and am currently looking for housing options in the $900–$1200 range (including utilities). I’d love a furnished place if possible!

I'm open to:

A short sublease for August–September

A longer sublease through the fall or beyond

A full-year lease (ideal!) for the duration of my program

I've lived in shared spaces for most of the last five years and have always been respectful of boundaries and shared living. I'm tidy, easygoing, and love making coffee and cooking Indian food (happy to share meals if you're interested!). 

Since I’ve never been to DC before, I’m hoping to live in a place that also gives me a soft landing socially in a new city and country.

If you have a space or know of anything coming up, I’d love to connect.

Hi everyone,
I’m currently looking for a barista internship or entry-level job around Bhaktapur or Kathmandu. I’m genuinely interested in coffee and café culture, and I want to gain real experience working in a coffee shop.

Even if it’s just an internship opportunity, I’m more than happy to learn and grow from the basics. I’m hardworking, quick to pick things up, and excited to be part of a café environment.

-Open to internship or paid work

-Preferably around Bhaktapur or KTM (can travel nearby)

-Flexible with timing

-Really looking to build experience in this field


If anyone knows of cafés hiring interns or baristas, or if you have any suggestions, please feel free to comment or message me. Thank you  in advance!",1,1751966898.0,NepalSocial,1,1.0,False

we have a peculiar finance situation and we are running into some arguments around nuisances, and i'm looking for feedback on how to split finances to avoid any disputes between me and my spouse in our peculiar situations.

\------------------

Context: We initially had joint finances and we ran into problems with discretionary spending, and so we've decided to split our finances a little further.

I'm building my own business, the business currently does not generate any income for us, and i'm spending full time working on it. My spouse is a stay-at-home-spouse and she is in charge of taking care of our 4 year old child.

We are currently living off of my savings, my spouse just has very small savings to her name, and we have following arrangements:

1. I pay for mortgage / property tax / housing / utilities / food / gas / etc
2. I pay for daycare fees / any child expenses / medical insurance / etc
3. My spouse is in charge of taking care of our child, feeding, bathing, potty times, dropping off and picking up the child from daycare, play with the child afterschool and putting the child to bed, also most of household chores, like cleaning, dishwashing, taking out trash, etc
4. I pay for my spouse's cellphone plans ($20/m)
5. I give my spouse $500 / month stipend for her own private spendings, and to acknowledge her hard work taking care of our child as the primary caretaker

we ran into some  arguments around small nuisances, which led us to re-evaluate this arrangement, specifically around the following:

1. If my spouse spends more on household goods than average (like toilet papers, wet wipes, shampoos, etc) should she chip in some from her own account to split the cost of household goods? (this would be something like $20 a month i'm asking from my spouse for the extra spend)
2. The stipend I'm giving my spouse ($500 / m) is purely and only for her own discretionary purchases for her own use (to buy things like her own makeups, snacks, etc), when she goes out with her friends, gifts she buys to her family and friends, clothes and toys she buys for our child without having to ask my permission, is this too little, given how expensive things are getting in 2025? My spouse carries joint credit card for household spending, so the stipend is used strictly for her own use
3. If my spouse goes out to a playdate with another parent, and she buys coffee, should that be from her own account or can she count that as ""family expenses"" and use the join account to pay for that?
4. If my spouse gets a part time job of sorts, and starts generating some sort of income, would it be fair to ask her to chip in for housing expenses, and gets less pay for stipend, etc?

(And Why It Actually Matters),"https://preview.redd.it/gvy8gngtbmbf1.jpg?width=5248&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e41be24080dea95a9bf387620e455872e4c83779

Let’s be honest for a moment. You’re scrolling through Pinterest or binge-watching HGTV. Suddenly, everything looks like it came from a Joanna Gaines dream. 

You spot shiplap, distressed wood, and burlap wreaths. Then the labels start flying: “rustic charm,” “farmhouse chic,” “modern rustic farmhouse.” What’s the difference?

**Spoiler alert:** Rustic and farmhouse décor are *not* the same. I know, it’s a shock 🤯. But don’t worry—I’m here to help. 

Let’s break it down like we’re chatting over coffee (or let’s be real—wine).

# Rustic vs. Farmhouse: Why People Get It Twisted

Let’s start here because, IMO, this is where the confusion usually begins.

**Rustic and farmhouse styles share a lot of DNA.** Both love natural materials. Both lean into simplicity. And both give major cozy vibes.

But—**and this is a big but**—they’re *not* identical twins. They’re more like cousins. Y

ou know, the ones who kinda look alike but one’s definitely into camping in the woods and the other’s into cute vintage bakeware.

**Recommended Post:-** [**Farmhouse Outdoor Decor Ideas** ](https://www.bestosmosisexperts.com/farmhouse-outdoor-decor-ideas/)

So what makes them different? Let’s dig in.

# What is Rustic Décor, Really?

# It’s Rough, Rugged, and Real

Rustic décor is basically what happens when nature meets design and skips the fancy stuff. It's all about raw textures, imperfections, and earthy tones. If you love the idea of a log cabin or a mountain lodge, rustic is probably your vibe.

**Core Features of Rustic Décor:**

* **Natural, unfinished woods** – Think rough-hewn beams, reclaimed barn wood, knotty pine.
* **Earthy color palette** – Browns, grays, greens… basically everything that makes you feel like you’re in a forest.
* **Handcrafted touches** – Wrought iron, stone, pottery, and hand-carved details.
* **Texture over polish** – If it's glossy and glam, it’s *not* rustic.

**IMO:** Rustic is like the bearded lumberjack of home décor. Rugged, a little wild, but undeniably charming.

# Common Rustic Elements You’ll Spot:

* Exposed wooden ceilings
* Stone fireplaces (the chunkier, the better)
* Rawhide rugs or distressed leather furniture
* Antlers, animal hides, or vintage outdoor gear (I mean… why not?)

**FYI:** Rustic doesn’t *have* to look like a hunting lodge. It can still be cozy and warm without looking like Paul Bunyan decorated your house.

# What is Farmhouse Décor?

# It’s Country-Inspired with a Soft Side

Farmhouse décor brings in the warmth of country living, but with a little more polish and purpose. It's lighter, brighter, and definitely cleaner (I mean… have you *seen* how white those kitchens are?).

**Core Features of Farmhouse Décor:**

* **Shiplap galore** – Thanks, HGTV. We get it. It’s timeless.
* **Neutral, airy color palettes** – Whites, creams, soft pastels.
* **Mix of vintage and new** – It loves a good flea market find as much as it loves Target.
* **Functionality** – Think large farmhouse sinks, oversized tables, and open shelving.

# Common Farmhouse Elements You’ll Spot:

* Painted furniture with distressed edges (because “perfect” is boring)
* Galvanized metal accents
* Mason jar *everything*
* Enamelware, wire baskets, and cozy textiles (hello, plaid throws)

**In short?** Farmhouse décor is like your sweet grandma’s house—but make it Pinterest-worthy.

# So, What’s the Actual Difference?

Ah, the million-dollar question. Let’s get specific. Here's a handy side-by-side for all you visual learners (ahem, me).

|**Feature**|**Rustic Décor**|**Farmhouse Décor**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Wood Finish**|Raw, rough, unfinished|Smooth, often painted or lightly distressed|
|**Color Palette**|Earth tones – browns, grays, forest greens|Whites, creams, soft neutrals|
|**Furniture Style**|Heavy, rugged, primitive|Practical, vintage-inspired, lighter|
|**Textures**|Stone, leather, rawhide, bark|Linen, cotton, galvanized metal|
|**Vibe**|Outdoorsy, cabin-like|Cozy, lived-in, country-chic|
|**Overall Look**|Masculine, rugged, grounded|Feminine, polished, homey|

**Bottom Line?**  
Rustic says, “Let’s go chop wood and build something.”  
Farmhouse says, “Let’s bake cookies and sip tea.”

# Can You Mix Rustic and Farmhouse Décor?

Absolutely! In fact, *some of the best designs come from blending the two*. Rustic can bring in the texture and grounding elements, while farmhouse keeps things fresh and friendly.

**Checkout This Post:-** [**Farmhouse Garden Decor Ideas**](https://www.bestosmosisexperts.com/farmhouse-outdoor-decor-ideas/)

# Here’s how you can pull it off:

* **Pair a rough-hewn wood dining table (rustic)** with **whitewashed chairs (farmhouse)**
* **Hang an iron chandelier (rustic)** above a **shiplap-paneled entryway (farmhouse)**
* **Use reclaimed barn wood (rustic)** to frame a mirror in a **bright white bathroom (farmhouse)**

Just keep the balance right. Too much rustic and you’re in a log cabin. Too much farmhouse and your space might look like a milk-themed Instagram post gone wrong. 😬

# Rustic or Farmhouse: Which One Fits You?

Still stuck on which one feels more *you*? Ask yourself a few questions:

* Do you drool over **stone fireplaces and leather armchairs**? → You’re probably into rustic.
* Do you swoon for **white cabinets and apron sinks**? → Farmhouse is calling.
* Do you love both? → Welcome to the *rustic farmhouse* club. We have cookies (and distressed coffee tables).

# Quick Quiz: Rustic or Farmhouse?

Just for fun, count how many of these you say “yes” to.

**Rustic:**

* You’d rather hike a trail than stroll through a mall.
* Your Pinterest is 80% log cabins and cozy fireplaces.
* You say “the more wood grain, the better!”

**Farmhouse:**

* You own at least one “gather” sign. (Be honest.)
* You think white paint is the answer to everything.
* Your dream kitchen has open shelves and vintage glassware.

If you checked more on one side, there’s your answer. If you said yes to both... you're just stylishly indecisive. No shame. 🙂

# Final Thoughts: Rustic and Farmhouse Might Be Cousins, But They’ve Got Their Own Swagger

Here’s the deal—**rustic and farmhouse décor may walk the same path, but they wear different shoes**. Rustic stomps in with boots caked in mud. Farmhouse floats in wearing vintage lace and a woven basket in hand.

When it comes down to it, there’s no “wrong” choice. It’s your space. If you love raw textures and rough edges, rustic’s your jam. If you adore cozy, clean, and a little vintage, farmhouse has your heart.

Or, you know, mix 'em. Because rules in design? Meh. They're more like suggestions 😉

# Ready to Redecorate?

Next time you're scrolling décor inspo or strolling through the thrift store, keep this little guide in mind. Don’t just follow trends—**follow what feels like** ***home*** to you.

And hey, if anyone tries to argue about “what's rustic vs. farmhouse,” you can hit 'em with the facts. Or just send them this article and say, “You're welcome.” 😉

I messed up. I really did. I didn’t get the help I needed in time for me to realize what I was doing was wrong. I wasn’t even trying at one point in our relationship. I hated how I felt around her. Now I know I was just disassociated and couldn’t figure out my emotions but the guilt of how badly I treated her eats me alive. 

She was my everything. She was kind, understanding and loving. She was terrified of Winnie the Pooh but adored cows. Her favourite character in helluva boss is Stolas and she related to him deeply. She liked tea better than coffee and loved David’s tea. She would take her showers boiling hot to the point where her skin would be red when she came out the bath. She was the Angel I needed when nobody was there to pick me up. She was a sap and never liked to admit she liked being romantic. 

We had plans of getting married and getting her a cottage house in the woods. We even thought about having kids. A little boy to be more specific. She wanted to call him Theodore. She was the unconditional love I craved so much. She was my family. My fiancée. I ruined everything by not listening to her. 

She has a boyfriend of a year now. They seem happy together. It kills me to see her so much happier with another person. I truly hope she gets the best in life. I wish I could go back in time and hug her one last time before leaving. 

I wish I had asked for help. I wish I had talked to a therapist. I wish I told her she was beautiful every single day I got to wake up next to her. We both blamed it on being dumb teenagers but I know deep down, I will never forgive myself for how I treated her. She’s the only person who saw me for me, who cared and loved me no matter what. I can’t even tell her I still love her. I will never find another woman as beautiful and kind hearted as she was. 

The day I apologized to her, she looked away from me. I know our connection is still there. She knew it too. I wish it wasn’t there anymore because now I have hope that if they break up, I’ll be able to see her and comfort her like she did for me. I would drop everything in a heartbeat if it meant I could see her again. For now, I just watch from a distance as she lives her best life with this better person. 

I know I deserve the pain I feel right now. She has suffered so much more mentally because of me. I worked on myself a lot and feel I have become a better person but a piece of me will forever be missing. I dread the day she gets married. I genuinely don’t think I can or ever will love someone like I loved her. She will always be my fiancée in my heart. The ring will forever be in my jewelry box. 

I miss you.

It is always about 10-step skin care routine, yoga, nutrition, journaling- all of which are great but none of those can work if you do not get a good 7-8 hour sleep.

I am that person who was doing all this but still having bad sleep. I was like Why me? I looked and felt exhausted even after doing everything right. My under eyes were getting darker and I had low energy even after my morning coffee. I then started making more changes like switching off screens early, drinking chamomile tea before bed but the real turning point was when I paid attention to where and how I was sleeping.

I saw that my old mattress had become uneven with dips in places and this might be why I was waking up with stiffness in my shoulders and lower back. I thought it was just part of getting older, Lol.

Anyway, I made an adult decision to invest in a proper **mattress for back support**. I wanted something that would be comfy, support my body and help in recovery.

I looked online and went to several **Indian mattress brands** stores. There were many good options and I went with the Luxe Royale Mattress from The Sleep Company after I saw they use an extra comfort layer for that plush feel and have firm support.

No other brand I saw had such a special technology based mattress. All others were normal spring or **memory foam mattress**. This was a premium model so it cost more but I am happy with it as it is worth the comfort and support.

The mattress feels luxurious and adjusts to my body shape and weight automatically. The only thing that troubled me was the weight. It is heavy and you cannot move around it easily.

I had started sleeping deeply in few days and stopped waking up multiple times at night. I was not feeling hot like I used to before on my old mattress. This stayed cooler all night and now sleep feels like part of my self-care. Not just because of the mattress, but because I finally started treating it as something important that deserved investment.",1,1751966033.0,u_DistrictFun8173,0,1.0,False

**The Problem:** Was doing market research last month and kept hitting paywalls. After burning through ""free articles"" on 5 different sites in one morning, I rage-quit and started building.

**The Solution:** OpenPress Hub ([https://openpress-hub.vercel.app](https://openpress-hub.vercel.app/)) - a news aggregator that only shows free articles. No paywalls, ever.

**Build Stats:**

* Time to MVP: 2 weeks (nights/weekends)
* Cost: $0 (Vercel free tier)
* Stack: Vanilla JS + Node.js (kept it simple)
* Current: Soft-launched yesterday, getting initial traffic

**What Worked:**

1. **Scratched my own itch** \- I use it daily myself
2. **Dead simple value prop** \- ""Google News without paywalls""
3. **Constraints = clarity** \- Only free sources made decisions easier
4. **Vanilla stack** = fast iteration, no build complexity

**Surprises:**

* 70+ quality sources are actually free (BBC, Reuters, NPR, etc.)
* ""Report paywall"" feature could create an engaged community
* Simple > clever (no fancy algorithms needed)

**Early Stage Growth:**

* Starting with Reddit posts
* Word of mouth potential (people hate paywalls!)

**Challenges:**

* Maintaining accurate source list
* Soft paywall detection (those ""3 free articles"" sites)
* Building an initial user base

**Revenue:** Added Buy Me a Coffee button but not expecting much. 

**Lessons So Far:**

1. Your frustration = others' frustration
2. MVP can be REALLY minimal
3. Free tier hosting has come so far
4. Launching is just the beginning

**Next Steps:**

* Get user feedback
* Browser extension version?
* API for developers?
* Focus on organic growth

Would love feedback from this community. Anyone else building in the news/media space? What worked for your early days?

My psychiatrist said there's nothing terribly wrong with this. I had the worst withdrawals and depression of my life, it was really hell on earth. It didn't go away for about 2 months so I consulted with my psychiatrist and we reinstated 100mg Fluvoxamine and I was instantly better. I stayed on 100mg for about 3 months. Then I tapered again to 75mg. I had withdrawals for a month -- again, apathy/anhedonia and fatigue/weakness. After that it went away for  2 weeks and I tapered to 50mg (my psychiatrist said I could), and since then I've been in withdrawal (at least that's what I think it is) for 5 months with strong apathy/anhedonia and strong fatigue and weakness and sleepiness coming and going in phases -- I'll be okay for 10 days and then the next days I have intense withdrawals. During all this I was also forced to switch from European Fluvoxamine manufacturer to Turkish for a while which also affected me a lot, I'm back on European now. I was also always drinking energy drinks, coffee, and taking caffeine pills during all this time which now I think might've contributed heavily to withdrawals. I cut out all caffeine for now.

I'm just looking for any advice on what to do and how to rehabilitate myself. I'm living as healthy as I can -- exercising if I can, eating healthy, going out in the sun, getting plenty of sleep. Not always able to do all this, obviously. I really don't want to up the dosage unless I absolutely have to because I'm scared I'll have to go through this again even if I microtaper. Also is there any chance it's not withdrawal but something else? I don't recall experiencing these symptoms before tapering. The only help I've gotten from my psychiatrist is her recommending another drug.

TL;DR: I'd been taking 100mg Fluvoxamine, 2.5mg Olanzapine and Clonazepam (0.5-1mg) for years. I quit clonazepam cold turkey in 2024 and then tapered to 25mg Fluvoxamine fast and had the worst withdrawals ever. Stayed for 3 months on reinstated 100mg Fluvoxamine and tapered to 75mg > 50mg again and I've been in withdrawal for 5 months now. Also had to switch to another brand for a while, which affected me badly. Was also always taking caffeine in some form during all this, which now I cut out.

1lujs6l,https://v.redd.it/4huask1i8mbf1,Agaro Imperial is Not Bad At All,"This sub reddit is too overcritical of Agaro Imperial coffee maker, with a few tweaks. 

Overall It is a good machine capable of making DECENT coffee that is borderline cafe level. Consider the price point of approximately 7k (with card discount). This machine is not a bad deal at all. Ofc with a few tweaks

Tweaks
#Depressurise your porta filter  
#Puck screen (200rs only) 
I cannot recommend it enough. Get a screwdriver and open all the screws in the porta filter that includes 3 in the basket and the one in the filter. Doing this will get you real cremma, which you will get out of your own efforts, not because of the porta filter. This will also enable you to tweak your own espresso according to your own taste. At the end of the pour, you will see that the crema you get is a bit broken. That is because of the porta filter, and if you really wanna go all the way you can get a bottomless porta filter, which will definitely get you thick cremma on top.  

I am using 16 g of coffee. You will only be able to fill 7 g of coffee when the filer is pressurised, which is not enough so its more of a reason to depressurise, your Porta filter. The extraction time was around 30 seconds and gave me a good 1:2 extraction ratio that is, I got 32-40 g of espresso. When I used 16 g of ground coffee. 

Now talking about the grinder, the grinder I am using is a grinder that I have locally bought, and I think it’s possibly Chinese, but it is able to grind fine enough, not professional level, but it’s fine enough and and also level tapping properly will also help, it doesn’t matter if you have a good tamper or a bad tamper as long as you’re making sure tamping is level you will get decent, shot.   

Now, as you see in the video that the cremma is not as perfect as we see in YouTube videos, but it tastes amazing. You only need to make sure that there are no clumps, tamp it flat and put a puck screen over.   

So my final word is even though in the video, the crema is not layered flat. It has holes in it, and the extraction looked very slow, was because of our modded filter but the espresso shot that came out of It tasted amazing and thats all that matters.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Golden State Valkyries vs. Indiana Fever: A Snail’s Pace Showdown**  
**Date:** July 9, 2025 | **Time:** 4:00 PM ET | **Odds:** Indiana -6.5 (-110), Golden State +6.5 (-110) | **Total:** Over/Under 160.5 (Under: -115, Over: -105)

**Prediction:**  
The Golden State Valkyries (9-8) will take their ""slow-mo defense, baby!"" mantra to Indianapolis, where the Indiana Fever (11-7) will likely sputter like a car with a coffee addiction. With the Valkyries ranked 2nd in defensive efficiency and the Fever’s offense as inconsistent as a TikTok algorithm, look for the **UNDER 160.5 total points** to cash like a broken ATM.

**Why?**

* The Valkyries’ defense allows just 98.3 points per game—roughly what you’d expect if you asked a wall to score.
* Indiana’s Caitlin Clark, while a magician with the ball, is priced at **-115 for Over 17.5 points**. But with Golden State’s D clamping down, she’ll likely hit her **Under 8.5 assists** prop (-154) instead.
* Tiffany Hayes, Golden State’s ""hot hand"" from two games ago, is due for a regression to her average 12.3 PPG. Don’t expect her to torch the Fever—her **Over 20.5 points** line is a 500/1 long shot on DraftKings.

**Final Score Prediction:**  
**Indiana Fever 72, Golden State Valkyries 78** (Under 160.5 by 0.5 points).

**Key Prop Bet:**

* **Caitlin Clark Under 8.5 Assists** (-154 on FanDuel). If she’s handing out dimes like a broke college student, this is your play.

**Play it Safe or Go for the Triple?**  
While the Fever are favored (-6.5), the Valkyries’ defense could make this a closer game than a Netflix password fight. But hey, if you *must* bet on points, go with the **Under 160.5**—it’s the only number these teams agree on.

*Tipoff: 4 PM ET. Bring snacks. This game might take longer than your average Zoom call.* 🏀✨

1lujpjv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sofia/comments/1lujpjv/2_days_in_sofia/,2 days in Sofia,"I will be visiting Sofia with two of my friends mid-August. We’re coming by bus from Skopje, North Macedonia.

Before I post this here, I was wondering if it would be smart to post at the main /bulgaria sub as well - there seem to be more people following that one.

We will be staying at an Airbnb in Studentski Grad. Although our apartment is on the top floor of a newly built apartment complex, I was wondering if the neighbourhood itself is safe, esp. at night? How’s the situation with night buses and metro? I see that there is a line N2 that would take us to the city center, but this line doesn’t seem to run the opposite direction and Google Maps suggests that the next train ride is in the morning. Do you guys use Bolt in these situations? How’s the Bolt in Bulgaria?

Also when it comes to public transportation, it seems that the metro in Sofia is our best option. Are there any better options for ticket purchasing than daily passes? Since we’re located in Studentski Grad, we will be using public transportation a lot. Also, my friends are fans of Shisha bars and I found a Bar Nargile and Urban Rebel close to our place - would you reccomend any of these two? Esp. at late night - they seem to be open, though.

Also, I read some comments how Sofia Airport has become one of the most efficient in the EU in the last couple of years - considering this, is it okay to arrive at the airport 1.5 h before your flight? We have no baggs to check in and we’d like to spend as much time in Sofia as possible (our flight back to Vienna is leaving at 9:20 pm local time). I was also thinking about having a dinner at the airport, but it seems to me that the dining options are not that many - is there any good dining spot on the yellow metro line you could recommend to us? Something authentic, but also a quick bite option we could grab before we get to the airport.

Since both of my friends are Lithuanians, we have noticed some distinct links between two countries - for instance, T Market is owned by the Lithuanian Maxima Group - we def need to visit one of these during our trip. Any specific store you could recommend? Like big in size and product variety. We also want to visit Hesburger - this place is so big in the Nordics and it’s so cool that you guys have it in Bulgaria! How are your experiences with Hesburger there?

Although I did an extensive research on restaurants serving traditional food, did my research on traditional dishes, found good coffee spots and bars (Ozone Skybar looks so cool!) - if you guys have any further suggestions or if you wanna promote some of your spots - feel free to drop it in the comments. No limits at budgeting!

Also any unique tourist attraction or tours that I might not have come across - any help is appreciated.

My Bulgarian is prob not even at A1 level, but as a native Serbian speaker I can only say blagodaram mnogo! :)

I was previously living and working in Dubai, but just shifted here for a new opportunity. It’s been an exciting change, but I’ll admit, I don’t really know many people here yet, and it’s starting to feel a bit quiet.

I’m hoping to connect with some like-minded people in the city who are open to getting to know someone new and maybe building a solid friendship over time.

A bit about me:

I love exploring cafes and trying out new coffee spots or dessert joints.

I enjoy reading fiction, especially thrillers or emotionally deep stories.

Always down to visit local events, town festivals, or cultural spots. I really enjoy soaking in the vibe of the city.

I also hit the gym occasionally, mostly to clear my head rather than chase six-pack dreams lol

I’m not a super extrovert by nature, and making friends IRL has always been a bit of a struggle for me, especially in a new city. So, I figured I’d give Reddit a shot and see if I could find people who vibe with me here.

If you’re someone who's open to chatting, maybe grabbing coffee, or just sharing recs and random convos online to start with, hit me up! Always great to meet people who are kind, chill, and not afraid of a little small talk turning into a deep conversation.

Cheers!

I was thinking of Barista Touch Impress with extra hopper, but unsure if the software has support for changing hoppers (beans) so that the saved coffee profiles understand what beans are being used, or will I end up re-calibrating it multiple times a day whenever I want to change beans.

_EDWIN: “Attention traitors, admin wing permissions have been revoked. And no, you can’t clear out your desks! You stole my work. Now your jackets, purses and coffee mugs and anything else belongs to me. Maybe I’ll go find someone to sell your stuff to. How does that feel?”_

One of Ralph’s messages says: _""The doors are locked, what are we supposed to do... sleep here.""_


This detail is important to note because it may help confirm or debunk a recent theory claiming that [Edwin is Sleepy Moon.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fivenightsatfreddys/s/akuYyNGvj8)

If the answer is that Ralph’s audio refers to a moment before the expulsion, then the timeline of events goes like this:

•Sleepy Moon is locked in the basement by the employees;

•Sleepy Moon leaves the message you can find in the game from the person trapped there;

•Employees leave MCM, so there's nobody to read the message of help from Sleepy Moon;

•Edwin locks down MCM and records his ""attention traitors"" tape;

•Edwin is attacked by M2 and the last Edwin tape happens;

•Fazbear sends people to get the schematics;

•They all die until Arnold arrives.


In other words, if Ralph’s message comes before the expulsion, then Edwin cannot be Sleepy Moon — meaning the theory falls apart.
But if it comes after, then this detail is a red herring meant to distract fans from the real goldmine.

Throughout the entire factory, we see dead workers stuffed into costumes. Could these be employees Edwin didn’t realize were still trapped in the building when he locked himself inside his mansion?

34M, 177 cm, 85 kg. My symptoms started last year after I fell ill with a flu. Headache, ear fullness, fever. A few weeks after that, I started to have the following symptoms (some more recent and ongoing, some soon after being ill or have since subsided):

\-dizziness: like a sudden surge that make me feel lightheaded, 2 seconds at most. started two weeks after illness.  
\-chest pain: a pain that got worse over time and goes away for days at a time but comes back. This is also a very sudden kind of pain, like stabbing on the left side, inside and at the same level as my left breast. sometimes it radiates to my back. Gets worse when I lay down on, or swallow. Happens every 1-2 minutes or every 2-3 swallows. started some time after illness.  
\-headaches: kind of like ice pick headaches, very sudden and almost always on the right side. sometimes indescribable

\-felling of fullness and weird sensation behind face: feels like something is stirring behind my face, like in the middle of my head.

\-fatigue: feel like I want to sleep, happens when other symptoms spike

\-metallic taste in mouth: started about two months ago, happens randomly and at the back of my mouth. I feel like they coincide with the dizziness but I'm not sure since the dizziness happens without the taste as well. hasn't happened for a while.

\-tinnitus: I've had this for a long time but it seems to have gotten worse. sometimes I'll also have spikes where suddenly it will increase in one ear for like 15-20 seconds.

\-shortness of breath: feels like I'm not getting air into my lungs and that my breathing is shallow, usually lasts a few hours. not as bad as it used to be but still happens

\-getting jerked awake just as I am falling asleep: feels like I have suddenly stopped breathing and my heart has stopped, and I am jolted awake. started about a month ago.

\-nausea: this happens whenever I have a spike in other symptoms. I also feel bloated even if I haven't eaten a lot. Feels like my food isn't digested properly

I have been to numerous doctors (cardiologist, ENT, physio, internal medicine,gastroenterologist) and 4 times to ER when some of these symptoms either first happened or got worse.

\-cardio: EKG, echocardiogram and heart enzymes came back normal. BP slightly elevated with average readings of 130-140(sys)/90-100(dia) with resting bpm of around 75. cholesterol and blood sugar slightly outside of normal range.  
  
\-ENT: I had previously been diagnosed with cochlear hydrops due to hearing loss in left ear (3 years ago). hearing tests again confirmed this and two ENT's said it could be due to meniere's, and one told me to reduce salt for a week which I did. It worked somewhat but the dizziness is still there. Brain scan from ER visit when dizziness first started also showed clogged (or swollen?) sinuses.  
  
\-gastroenterologist: told me its stress related, gave me pentaprazole and told me if it helps then it could be gastro related: I took the medicine but I'm not sure it helps   
  
\-physio: did a balance test for the dizziness and told me it was vestibular, and to see ENT.

\-internal medicine: presribed zinc because saw it was low on blood test and told me my issues were pyschological.

\-ER: heart test came back normal, lung x ray okay, brain CT scan showed congested sinus according to ER doctor.

I quit smoking 6 months ago and decreased alcohol consumption, before that a regular drinker and occasional smoker. I take b12, vit d and zinc supplements because they came out low on blood test, and also omega 3. No medication. Don't drink coffee anymore and haven't eaten meat (only fish occasionally) for the past 1.5 years. I have had anxiety for the past 15 years but haven't had any physical symptoms that are associated with it, other than the occasional panic attack and accompanied sweating (the most recent one about 6 months ago due to these symptoms and health anxiety, and the associated fear of death).

I recently had a spike in symptoms that made me feel like I was going to die (extreme dizziness when breathing in, sweaty hands and feet, strange feeling in chest), and have been feeling slightly off since then.

Sorry for the long post, I know these symptoms may seem unrelated but I haven't been able to list out my symptoms in detail to any doctor since they wouldn't listen for that long and I'm at my wits end trying to figure out what may be wrong with me. My question is, do these symptoms sound like dysautonomia? I have searched the sub but see people only with some of the symptoms I list. Any help is appreciated!

I'm writing this  hoping that I might help a few people who wish to visit without a car Palau/La Maddalena.

Me and my wife spent 7 days in Palau in **June 2025**. We had a good experience overall. 

**Transport** from Olbia to Palau: Our plane arrived around 11 am in Olbia, we took a bus Nr2/ Nr 10  to centre of Olbia , near port and afterwards we took bus Nr 601 to Palau. Buses were not too crowded, tickets were cheap 1.5 and 4€ per person. To  return from Palau we did the same thing in reverse. We took the bus from the street Viale Razzoli ( you can take it also from Palau port) to Olbia centre and form there we took bus nr 10 to Olbia airport. According to their timelines, the bus is scheduled hourly but sometimes can be late as all buses are.

If you think about getting a taxi or uber for the same distance expect to pay between 100-150€ a trip.

**Palau/La Maddalena experience & costs**:  Amazing views, great beaches, chilled people. Food was outstanding and not  as expensive as I thought. We paid for two pizza and one large water under 30€. One coffee+ croissant 4€. To cross from Palau to La Maddalena is a ferry which goes both ways costing about 14€ per person. 

Is definitely worth taking a boat trip to see the northern  small islands, we took a trip recommended by our hotel which was 120€ per person, lasts all day, we only had 12 people on the boat  and we had drinks, snacks and lunch included. I think there are cheaper ones around but  you need to check in Palau port.

Spending 7 days just in Palau was a bit much for us, I think 4-5 days is enough unless you like to spend a more days at the beach/pool. Here is what we did: 1st day- settle in, take a walk in town, booked boat trip. 2nd day- boat trip, 3rd day- Visit one of La Maddalena beaches. 4th and 5th day- Beach Spiaggia de La Sciumara,  6th day- Visit La Maddalena town, 7th day- All day at the hotel's pool. At the beach you can get 2 sun beds and umbrella for 25-40€.

I am resorting to asking on Reddit as I've already been to an ENT a couple of times but so far I haven't had a definite diagnosis yet. 

So my symptoms started around the middle of last year. It first started with some weird taste on my tongue that kept going on and off weeks at a time. Sometimes it would be like a peppery kind of taste, on other times it tasted more minty.  I frequented my dentist back then, who only prescribed me mouthwash. I am not sure if the symptoms during that time are related to what I am experiencing now, but I am including them nonetheless. 

Then in December, I started experiencing what I think were globus sensations. There were days I would feel like there was a lump, or something stuck  in my throat. Other days I felt like my throat was tightening up. The symptoms worsened as I worried about them, especially since during that time I was dealing with a lot of anxieties. I visited an ENT who looked down my throat with a scope and saw nothing and said that it might just be a viral irritation that would go away on its own.

However, the symptoms persisted on-and-off for a couple of months, so I went back to the ENT and was prescribed omeprazole which I took for a month, and I also avoided coffee and acidic food. However, this didn't seem to help, and by this time my throat also started to become constantly mildly sore.   
  
I was told to get an x-ray and to see a pulmonologist just to write off the possibility of TB of the throat. However, as I needed to cough up phlegm to test for TB (which I couldnt manage, even after taking expectorants) I could not proceed with the test. Either way, the pulmonologist said that TB was unlikely.   
  
I have not been back to the ENT yet, and I have since just re-initiated the low-acid diet. Currently, my symptoms are:

\- frequent throat clearing  
\- constant mild sore throat / throat pain  
\- ""tangy"" (almost citrusy) taste on the tongue  
\- sometimes feeling hoarse (though my voice still sounds normal)  
\- post nasal drip

I do not experience any chest pains, gassiness, or bloatedness. I also never had any problems with swallowing or breathing. In fact, swallowing food seems to temporarily relieve me of my symptoms. 

Does this sound like LPR? And if so, is this something that I can manage myself without going back to the doctor or taking any medications? 

Any feedback or advice would be greatly appreciated.

What’s your homework this week? No homework? She (or he, shout out to Dan) may have given up. And a therapist doesn’t always want to burden someone in a bad state with more work and feelings of guilt for not doing it. I think it’s potentially a disservice.

It’s how things change. There are 168 hours in the week and therapy is (less than) one. What else are you doing?

As someone with depression, my view has always been dark. If there’s an event coming, I’m pretty sure it’ll suck (for me). It takes real work to start to include the possibility that it might be mediocre.

Doing your homework changes your brain tissue. After a year of successful therapy, your brain will look different under a microscope. It’s called neuroplasticity. People think of it as a software problem but it’s really hardware. Our hardware is our software. It’s closer to firmware, like an EEPROM which has programming but can be updated.

My brain had a superhighway straight to depression-ville. I was talking to my therapist Patty about it, who did trauma work after Sandy Hook, and it felt like carving a new path through the woods. Every time you do the homework you’re walking that path, smoothing and widening it.

Three months of daily homework is enough to change things for the better and it doesn’t go away with a bad mood or a bad day. It’s physical brain tissue and you can rely on it. I cant tell if it took longer than i expected or a lot less.

Think of them as push-ups and you can do it in a pile of blankies and pillows. I did some of that, along with sitting alone in the garage month after year plowing through it with a coffee a smoke and a smoke, one of which was prescribed for PTSD.",8,1751964450.0,selfimprovement,11,1.0,False
1lujjw2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthygamergg/comments/1lujjw2/re_natural_selection_vs_dating_youtube_video/,"Re natural selection vs dating youtube video. Woman's perspective on ""approaching"".","

Some points I agree are true:

- women are more risk averse than men
- women are more selective than men
- economic times suck. lots of men have fewer resources
- a huge driver, though not the only factor, in dating and marriage and relationships, is sharing resources
- the world is less set up today for the average man to acquire a sufficient amount of resources that can support a family or treat a date
- the appearance of abundance on dating apps makes all parties less satisfied with choices

What's true for me personally:

- Men can be scary
- I assume strangers who approach me either want sex or money
- When a man approaches you, there's no way to know in advance whether he is a safe person
- I have my own specific preferences and desires in life and relationships - I don't just exist for men to practice
- It's typically not worth my time to engage with random men romantically - high risk, and low chance they're what I'm looking for

So, when I hear men complaining about being afraid of approaching women, I think 2 things will help.

- reduce fear
- increase desire

If you're ""approaching me"" and it involves semi-cornering me at the back of a coffee shop, or running after me in a park when I'm on a run to hand me your business card, or start a conversation by asking where I live at night at a bus stop, (all have happened multiple times) I don't care about how the modern economy impacts your dating life, I don't care if someone has said insensitive things about you on twitter, I don't care that telepathic powers would reveal you're clueless but well intentioned - I'M SCARED.

These experiences with men sour every single experience with a man that I don't know because if you don't know me, the primary driver for you talking to me is because I'm a woman and you probably eventually (or, immediately) have some desire for sex that you think I can fulfill. 

As a man, you have to reduce the fear women have for you by virtue of other experiences with men before I'm even interested in talking to you as a PERSON (never mind romantically) instead of engaging with you like you're a THREAT. 

You can either pressure other men to just ""be better"" (good luck), or, you can go out of your way to not seem intimidating. 

This is why hobbies are recommended so often. If you go into the hobby to focus on the hobby, women will be around and not your focus. Women feel safer around you when you're not focused on us. We don't like feeling like a goal - it feels like we're prey. Minor inconsequential interactions over time with anything leads basically all mammals to feel safer around the thing that they're exposed to. Every single relationship I've had started at a hobby or through meeting a friend through a friend.

So, in my opinion, there is no approaching. I have never given my number to someone I man I ""met in the wild"", who I didn't already know. Frankly, I don't think this is normal behaviour for humans. Imagine interacting with a man who was a stranger any time before the 1800s? I don't think we evolved under situations where that was normal. You met men around other people, you were rarely alone with them, and there was always some social pre-vetting process, whether you knew them through church or family traded grain with them, or went to town halls, etc etc. Even when a man approaches me and I think he's well intentioned, I feel used either for my attractiveness (I feel slightly offended that the only reason to interact is physical), or, I feel like I'm being used for practice to improve someone else's social skills, which I don't entirely necessarily mind if I already think you're a safe person, but to be *expected* to do this for men at their will when I'm going about my own life is extremely off putting.

Increasing desire is a whole other subject I'm not going to touch. 

But aside from men, what about me?

I have a very specific lifestyle with respect to my desire for children, religion, politics, housing, and plans for which cities to live in for the long and short term. Without considering the desires of men I don't know, and outside of my own romantic desires, I have plans, goals, and motivation to have my life in a specific way that brings me the most peace and happiness. On a practical level, I experience enough difficulty adjusting or modifying my work schedule, educational goals, and being fulfilled in other areas like relaxation, family, social life, and hobbies, and just taking care of my physical and mental health, that even when I find a man I want to bring into my life, it takes a lot of compromise and adjustment. 

So, even if find a way to ""approach me"" that isn't intimidating, I'm old enough to know that fewer than 0.1% of men fit into my life (I've done the math). It's not a height or income thing, I've just learned through what doesn't work through trial and error and the list is long. That's not your fault, and that's not my fault - you're not required to be what I want, but I'm not obligated to give every person a chance.

There's very little reason to interact with a man who approaches you. And, you probably scare me, even if that's not your fault. The fastest relationships I've had with men are the ones who seemed less threatening or dangerous.

TDLR

Participating in IRL hobbies is where I have met all my partners. It's easier to not fear men when you encounter them in situations where they are not your focus. It allows you to learn about each other in a way, slowly, over time, that doesn't make you feel like prey, or used as practice so you can get better at interacting with women.",6,1751964442.0,Healthygamergg,7,0.75,False

[€1000],"Hi , I am going from Sage touch impress, this machine is half good half bad(or maybe i am just too demanding). I drink mainly espresso and lungo and wife drinks latte. Budget is 1000eur just machine (Europe), ideally with options - I dont want single temperature and manually clicking start/stop. I dont plan to go deeper into a hole.

I decided to go with eureka specialita and I wanted sage dual boiler as it has 58mm PF and a lot of options, but I looked at dimensions and with size bigger than touch impress and separate grinder, it takes all table space I have in my kitchen. I started thinking about something smaller for temporary time, in that case I dont want spend a lot. I have few accessories for 54 PF, so currently considering only 54 or 58mm. I found bambino plus for 322eur in sea salt color, looks as a good deal, except that I am not sure if I will be happy with this machine.

More info about touch impress: At first it was nice, then I found grinder(baratza) is struggling with a lot of beans even medium, and as I was trying to improve my brew, I started to hate intelligent dialin and dosing, hot water flow, tamper has small diameter for 3rd baskets, automilq does not give good results with low fat milk.

 ""I don't break the laws of physics. I give them anxiety.""




---

🧬 Origin Summary

Heavenborn is a cosmic, angelic being crafted from the very fabric of pure light and divine will, the first of his kind, existing before time, above gods, and outside the comprehension of mortals. He was handcrafted by God Himself and considers omnipotence a bit... boring.


---

🔱 CORE ABILITIES


---

☀️ 1. Absolute Light Manipulation

Manipulates light on every scale: photonic, conceptual, emotional, and divine.

Signature Move: “Solar Oblivion Beam” — a galaxy-obliterating, reality-tearing beam of focused divine light.



---

🧠 2. Omniscience (Selective)

Knows everything at once but can “tune it down” for sanity and sass.

Sees past, present and future simultaneously and at the same time.

Can recall any event in any reality instantly.

Roasts people using information from their darkest, most embarrassing secrets.



---

💀 3. Invincibility

Literally cannot be harmed by any known power, weapon, or force.

Has tanked:

Collapsing multiverses.

Conceptual erasure attacks.

Reality reset events.

Attempts by the UN and all global powers to contain him.




---

🌀 4. Absolute Transcendence:
  exists beyond all possible frameworks, including but not limited to:

Time

Space

Dimensions

Narrative

Logic

Causality

Concepts

Systems of power, cosmology, or metaphysics


---

⛓️ 5. Cosmic Strength.

Snapped a planet in half like a breadstick for comedic timing.

Can lift entities made of pure concept or dense time particles.



---

🚀 6. Incomprehensible Speed

Exists in every point of space simultaneously when he feels like it.

Once raced light... and stopped mid-race to get coffee, still won.

Perceives time so slowly that moving at infinite speed feels like a stretch.



---

😇 7. Divine Aura

His mere presence:

Causes celestial phenomena to erupt.

Makes lesser beings kneel, weep, or disintegrate.

Short-circuits advanced technology (and egos).




---

🧬 8. Reality-Shattering Energy

Has to actively limit his power at all times or he’ll break reality like glass.

Once sneezed and a star cluster evaporated.

Has never gone all-out... until that one enemy pushed him to 100%.



---

🎭 9. Shapeshifting / Masked Form

Wears a glowing mask to hide his true form, which is too beautiful and too dangerous for reality to handle.

Claims taking it off would “fold reality in on itself.” and he's ""too hot and gorgeous for reality to handle.""



---

🧠 10. Divine Intelligence

Holds infinite PhDs for fun.

Can teach every form of science across every multiverse... to toddlers.

Built a toaster that runs on paradoxes.

I know everyone's *just a little* upset about the latest Dune: Awakening patches that might have deleted player's inventories, made the game unplayable with constant disconnects, and left the PvE zones completely wide open for hackers to stroll in, steal your vehicles, erase your base, and take your spice.

But like... can we please have some compassion?

Funcom is a small indie studio. They've barely been around since 1993 and that's like three weeks in game dev years? They've only released tiny passion projects like Conan Exiles. It's not like they've had **over 30 years** to figure out how to run a server or detect blatant cheaters or anything. Be reasonable. That kind of technical expertise takes at least 300 years to master, probably.

They have a mere 400 employees across their studios in Norway, the US, and Portugal. That's barely enough people to run a lemonade stand, let alone a survival MMO set in the Dune universe with real money riding on its success. Come on, have a heart. 💔

And yes, I know that Funcom is fully owned by Tencent, a plucky little upstart from China trying to find its place in the world. They only make like $84 billion in revenue per year. Probably just barely enough to buy a cup of coffee in Norway. ☕️

So please, next time you log in and find your base destroyed, your vehicle stuck in quicksand, and your character falling through the terrain while a Russian hacker laughs in local chat .. just remember: **Funcom is trying**. And trying is all that matters. Asking them for more is just toxic gamer talk.

Let’s give this brave little indie startup the space it needs to grow. Maybe in another 30 years they'll figure out how to patch without deleting the universe.

(She’s probably bi, though, but that doesn’t matter so much.) Similar things have happened before with some of my other friends (outside this friend group), and they really disturbed me.

I feel both loved and confused, because I don’t know how she sees me. I don’t know how to feel or what to do. Should I talk to her? Should I come out to her?",1,1751963524.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

By noon, I always feel completely drained, and to push myself to keep working, I have to promise myself a candy or another cup of coffee.

So I started wondering, what if I quit coffee and sugar altogether? Would my energy levels stabilize? Would my body react to the absence of those dopamine spikes?

The way it works is pretty simple: when we drink coffee or eat something sweet, our body gets a short burst of energy — followed by a crash. Imagine a steep mountain peak if you were to plot it on a graph.

I switched to tea and started eating a bit of dark chocolate and fruit instead.
After just three days, I noticed real progress. It turns out my body and brain were totally exhausted — basically begging me to stop feeding them this stuff. “We’re already working for you 24/7, give us a break!”

My overall state improved, and quitting those habits wasn’t that hard once I had a clear motivation.
That’s my little experiment. What do you think, coffee lovers and sugar fans? Worth it or should we keep these treats as life’s little joys?",1,1751963519.0,productivity,1,1.0,False
1lujbvg,https://www.reddit.com/r/mainlineprotestant/comments/1lujbvg/the_ship_of_fools_an_oddysey/,The Ship of Fools: An Oddysey,"Once upon a time, in the sleepy town of Middling Heights, there stood a grand but half-empty church called First United Congregational Lutheran Presbyterian Methodist Church of Respectable Fellowship (F.U.C.L.P.M.C.R.F. for short).  
  
Inside its beige-carpeted sanctuary, the faithful gathered every Sunday, mostly to stave off the creeping suspicion that their best days had sailed long ago.  
  
Reverend Mike stood behind the pulpit, thumbing through his Bible while scratching his rear end.  
  
""God is alive,"" he intoned, ""behind my well-prepared notes about decency, procedural efficiency, and...""  
(he flipped through Reader's Digest),  
""Honda Accords"".  
  
The congregation of politely embalmed widows nodded in solemn approval. One might have been deceased since last Lent, nobody was sure, and it seemed rude to check.  
  
In the fellowship hall, Reverend Sarah was arranging folding chairs for her 9th self-discovery workshop titled:  
  
""Celebration of Life: Embracing Your Inner Narrative After You've Outlived Your Pets.""  
  
She wore a flowing purple shawl and spoke in the soothing tone of a woman who'ld recently discovered herself and was determined to never shut up about it.  
  
Meanwhile, Reverend Ted arrived in his convertible with his boyfriend Pedro riding shotgun. Bursting through the doors, he shouted:  
  
""Rejoice! For I have reinterpreted the Epistles as a fabulous coming-out story, and St. Paul was DEFINITELY a closeted queen!""  
  
Sister Mabel clutched her pearls. Reverend Sarah dabbed her eyes and whispered, ""So brave"".  
  
During coffee hour, everyone gathered around the sacred potluck table:  
  
Tuna casseroles congealing in Pyrex.  
  
A holy mountain of powdered donuts.  
  
And the Green Jello, quivering ominously in the corner.  
  
Suddenly, a hush fell over the room. The doors creaked open, and Grimace, the Great Purple Embodiment of the Ache, waddled solemnly into their midst.  
  
He lifted a blessed McNugget heavenward and spoke in a voice like the deep fryer of the soul:  
  
""Behold, when you eat the pink goo, the goo also eats you.""  
  
The entire congregation shuddered. Reverend Mike dropped his Reader's Digest, stunned, his jaw agape. Reverend Ted clutched Pedro's hand tighter. Reverend Sarah wept into her shawl.  
  
Grimace slowly turned, waddling back to the parking lot, leaving only the faint scent of processed wonder behind him.  
  
And in that moment, just for an instant, the Ship of Fools realized the mystery they had been missing all along.  
  
But then Reverend Mike cleared his throat and announced:  
  
""Well, time to review the budget.""  
  
The spell was broken.

I have a spray can of glossy, transparent “lacquer”, but that would definitely ruin it I think.

He has been working there for 3 months and he had a curiosity since the start, why are there no non Indians in the team. After 6-9 months and post some meetings with his manager, he has observed the following things:

1) We Indians have the worst sense of work life balance amongst the other ethnicities.
2) People come early to the office and stay late just because the manager sits late.
3) Many complain about you if you try to leave early and bitch about you.
4) Some even go to the extent of justifying it, by saying we worked for 14 hours a day at the start of our career, 8-9 is normal for us.
5) They like to send emails and chats late in the night too and expect you to respond immediately.
6) There's a general expectation that you need to work overtime if the workload is much more than for one person to handle.


Just to let you know, Sweden being a Nordic country has one of the best work life balances. Here people take vacations for 4-6 weeks mandatorily and do not send emails or chats outside of working hours.

It just seems that Indians are bound to destroy the very same thing that we came for to these countries. And no, we are not the most productive people. We spend hours gossiping in office, taking multiple coffee/tea breaks as well as long lunch breaks.

Eventually, no non Indian guy wants to be in a team with Indian managers and this causes some bias towards Indians getting promoted as managers.",120,1751963224.0,IndianWorkplace,18,0.95,False

1luj3u8,https://www.reddit.com/r/HarmonicTsukuyomi/comments/1luj3u8/episode_31_the_authors_gambit/,Episode 31: The Author's Gambit,"**Setting:** Blackrock Depths (BRD), Azeroth (Hana’s timeline WoW server) & Austin, Texas, Mizkif’s Apartment, November 20, 2032

The air in the **Blackrock Depths** was thick with the stench of sulfur and desperation. Zackrawrr, now **Level 38 (Human Warrior)**, roared as he cleaved through a Dark Iron Slaver, his **Slayer's Shiv** gleaming in his off-hand. Hana, a calm yet deadly **Level 40 (Quantum Arcanist)**, weaved arcane energy around him, her eyes constantly scanning for the metadata anomalies that betrayed their reality's true nature. They’d pushed deep, past the Ring of Law, past the Grim Guzzler, towards **Emperor Dagran Thaurissan**.

""Alright, chat, this is it,"" Zackrawrr muttered, glancing around the dimly lit corridor. ""Last boss before we get to the real juicy stuff. No wipes this time, okay? I can't take another quantum reset. My brain feels like scrambled eggs after the last one.""

But as they rounded a corner, the dungeon itself seemed to **rebel**. The stone floor buckled, cracks spiderwebbing with unnatural speed. A group of Dark Iron Guardians, previously easily manageable, suddenly became **invulnerable**, their health bars replaced by a flashing ""ERROR: PLOT ARMOR ACTIVATED.""

""What the hell is this?!"" Zackrawrr bellowed, his sword bouncing harmlessly off a dwarf’s chest. ""This isn't a mechanic! This is some... *developer oversight!*""

In his Austin apartment, Mizkif clutched his head, surrounded by empty coffee cups. His monitors were a kaleidoscope of chaos. He was trying to write a dramatic setback for Zackrawrr and Hana, convinced that only a major crisis would force his story back into line. He’d typed: *“The heroes face an insurmountable obstacle, a testament to the Void Lord’s escalating power.”* Now, the digital realm was literally breaking apart.

“Why won’t they just *die* and follow the narrative?!” Mizkif screamed at his screen, typing frantic commands. He tried to introduce a sudden cave-in, trapping them. *“A catastrophic rockslide seals their path forward.”*

In BRD, the ceiling above Zackrawrr and Hana began to rumble, dust and pebbles raining down. ""RUN! IT'S A CAVE-IN!"" Hana yelled, Quantum Flickering backwards. Zackrawrr cursed, turning to follow. But as he ran, the floor ahead of him **flickered**, turning into a solid, unyielding wall of code before snapping back to stone. Their path was inexplicably blocked.

""You've gotta be kidding me!"" Zackrawrr yelled, kicking the stone. ""First invulnerable dwarves, now a literal invisible wall? This is worse than retail WoW!""

Hana, however, was no longer looking at the ceiling. She was staring at the shimmering distortion that had momentarily blocked their path. Her **Tsukuyomi’s Whisper** was buzzing wildly, picking up coherent thought patterns now. It wasn't just metadata; it was a voice. A familiar voice.

*""No, no, no, you idiots! Go the other way! I wrote a surprise boss down this corridor! Don't ruin the suspense!""*

The voice, clearly Mizkif’s, resonated directly in Hana’s mind. She turned, looking at Zackrawrr, then back at the glitch. It was him. The author.

""Zackrawrr,"" Hana said, her voice surprisingly steady. ""The voice… you hear it too? It's our author. He's... trying to force us into a specific plotline.""

Zackrawrr’s jaw dropped. ""The actual Mizkif?! My hype man?! He’s writing us?! This is the *most insane* stream content of all time! Dude, this ain't a game anymore, it's his fanfiction! Mizkif, you son of a b—""

Mizkif, hearing Zackrawrr’s voice, a clear, furious roar emanating directly from his monitor’s speakers, screamed and fell out of his chair. “THEY CAN HEAR ME?! OH MY GOD!” He scrambled back, staring wide-eyed at his screen, where Zackrawrr was now shaking his virtual fist directly at the camera.

A chilling, familiar whisper snaked into Mizkif’s ear, louder than ever: **""destroy.""** It was a seductive thought, a promise of control. *Just delete the file. Reset the variables. Burn it all down and start fresh. You are the author. You have the power.*

Mizkif’s fingers hovered over his keyboard, tempted by the urge to simply hit ""Delete"" on the entire ""Harmonic Tsukuyomi"" project. His world felt like it was teetering on the brink, his friendships strained, his mental state fragile from the blurring lines of reality.

On Earth-Prime (Amina’s universe), Amina stood with Dr. Holt, watching the volatile quantum signatures from Asmongold’s shard. “The link is becoming two-way,” Holt stammered, pointing at the graphs. “The characters… they’re pushing back against the narrative. The causality loops are in overdrive!”

Suddenly, the shard in Amina’s hand flared, and she heard Mizkif’s panicked voice, faint but clear, echoing from it: *""They can hear me?!""*

Amina’s eyes widened. ""He's losing control,"" she breathed. ""The narrative is gaining sentience. And the Void Lord… it’s feeding on the instability."" She knew the ""destroy"" whisper was not just Mizkif's stress, but the insidious influence of a cosmic entity craving true chaos.

Back in BRD, the invulnerable dwarves continued their relentless, unscripted assault. The path forward was still blocked by the invisible wall. Hana looked at Zackrawrr, then at the glitching, impossible wall. She knew this was her chance. She channeled all her available energy, focusing her **Tsukuyomi’s Whisper** not on the dwarves, but on the very fabric of the distorted reality. She envisioned a message, a plea, a direct demand for autonomy.

“Mizkif!” Hana’s voice, amplified by the quantum distortion, cut through the chaos, echoing not just in the dungeon, but directly into Mizkif’s frantic mind. “Your story is alive! We are not just characters! You cannot simply *delete* us! This reality… it’s unstable because of your attempts to control it!”

Mizkif froze, his fingers inches from the delete key. He could hear her. He could *feel* their resistance. The weight of their sentience, the consequences of his casual authorship, crashed down on him with the force of a collapsing star. The Void Lord's whisper turned into a tantalizing, almost desperate plea: *“Destroy… control… restart…”*

The fight with the invulnerable dwarves raged around Zackrawrr. “Mizkif, you absolute gremlin!” he yelled, adding his own, less eloquent, but equally desperate plea. “Stop trying to make me trip! Let us play the damn game! We got a raid to clear, bro!”

The fate of their reality, their story, now hung in the balance, a chaotic blend of quantum physics, authorial crisis, and one very annoyed streamer-turned-protagonist.",1,1751962603.0,HarmonicTsukuyomi,0,1.0,False
