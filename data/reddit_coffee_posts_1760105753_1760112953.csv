1o35bdz,https://i.redd.it/dsayk0407buf1.png,"He Gave My Ring to Her, So I Wedded His Rival","Chapter 1



After discovering that Kason had been secretly seeing his mistress for three years and was planning to marry her, I decided to leave him and return home for an arranged marriage.



On the first day, I handed the engagement ring he had given me to his mistress.



On the second day, I discarded everything that reminded me of him.



On the third day, I put on my wedding dress and married his arch-rival, Ronan.



From that day forward, Kason and I were no longer connected.



Kason scoffed, thinking I was just throwing a tantrum.



Until he saw the news of my marriage to someone else.



Only then did he panic.



==============================



In the office, the two of them were completely unaware of my presence outside the door.



I poured out the coffee I had made for Kason and left.



Kason had always kissed me with such care, so I had never seen him so passionate before.



Now I knew it was because he had given that side of himself to someone else.



I had thought I could marry for love, but reality had hit me hard.



Numb and disheveled, I wiped away my tears and took a cab back to the mansion.



As soon as I got out of the car, several unfamiliar messages came through.



They were from Ximena.



""You heard it, didn’t you? Mr. Henry is going to give me a wedding even grander than yours.""



Reading those words, my heart still clenched.



He had once said that he would only ever step into a wedding hall with me.



But now, the wedding we had been looking forward to for so long had become a tool to placate his little bird.



Seeing that I hadn’t replied, Ximena sent several more photos.



In them, she and Kason were entwined, their intimacy unmistakable.



""Has he ever loved you like this?""



I gave a bitter smile and didn’t respond.



Instead, I saved the chat history and walked into the mansion.



Less than half an hour after I got home, Kason arrived with a large bouquet of roses.



The roses were fragrant, but I could still detect that unique sweetness on him.



Before, he had only carried my scent.



But now, it was no longer mine.



When I pushed him away, Kason looked momentarily stunned but quickly recovered.



He kissed the corner of my mouth, as if coaxing a child, and spoke softly to me for a long time.



In the past, this was how he would calm me down when he made me angry, and I would always forgive him after just a few words.



But this time, I didn’t want to forgive.



Seeing my lack of response, Kason pulled out a red velvet box from his pocket.



""Luisa, look what this is.""



I opened the box to find the royal diamond ring I had wanted for so long.



Back then, Kason had felt guilty for not being able to buy it for me.



But now, seeing the hidden guilt in his eyes, I knew it was just a bribe after his betrayal.



Remembering the promises Kason had made to me, I instinctively looked at him.



""Luisa, I’ve finally given it to you, this ring that belongs only to you.""



""From now on, it’s just you and me, forever.""



My fingers traced the ring, but my heart felt as if it were being torn apart.



Kason, you still remember the promises you made back then, so how could you change your heart now?



With a bitter smile, I took off the ring, but Kason grabbed my hand, his voice urgent.



""Luisa, what are you doing?""



""Don’t you like it anymore?""



A flash of panic crossed Kason’s eyes, but I hid my feelings and spoke calmly.



""Rings are most meaningful when given on the wedding day.""



I saw Kason visibly relax, but my heart ached unbearably.



Once, I had hoped to grow old with you, to spend our lives together.



But now, Kason, we have no future.



He put the ring away, slapping his forehead in frustration.



""It’s my fault for being so impatient, Luisa.""



""But the thought of finally being able to marry you makes me so eager.""



Kason grew more and more excited as he spoke, and in the past, I would have been moved to tears.



But now, I just looked at him calmly, my face expressionless.



Seeing my calm demeanor, a flicker of guilt passed through his eyes, and he was about to say something.



But then his phone lit up, and Kason’s face darkened, only to turn excited the moment he saw the message.



He scrolled through the screen, his Adam’s apple bobbing, a flash of desire in his eyes.



Then he turned off the screen and sighed, feigning regret.



""Luisa, I’m sorry, but something’s come up at the office. I have to go.""



Before I could respond, Kason rushed out, not even grabbing his coat.



I still called out to him, ""Is it really something important?""



He froze at my words, then smiled and said, ""Of course it is. Why would I lie to you? Wait for me, I’ll be back.""



Then he turned and left without hesitation.



I knew he was going to see Ximena.



And I knew he wouldn’t be coming back tonight.



Looking at the empty room, I suddenly laughed.



I had once told him that if he lied to me and I found out, I would leave his world forever.



Kason, since you lied to me.



We’ll never see each other again.

Chapter 2

Four hours later, I got a text from Ximena Mills.

“Guess what I found in Kason’s clothes?”

She sent me a photo.

It was the ring Kason had given me.

I stared at the picture, my heart feeling like it was being crushed.

Ximena’s messages kept coming.

“This ring, Kason gave it to you, right?”

“Too bad, with just a little charm, it’s mine now.”

My vision blurred, and my hands shook so much that I dropped my phone.

In just a few hours, the ring he said was meant only for me had ended up with someone else.

Just like our years together, it wasn’t mine anymore.

The phone screen was still glowing, but I couldn’t bring myself to look at it.

I numbly washed my face, scrubbing away the last bit of feeling I had for him.

The next morning, when I woke up, Kason was already back.

He looked smug, with faint red marks on his neck.

I didn’t say anything, just stared straight at him.

Kason avoided my gaze, then tried to cozy up to me.

“Luisa, I’m sorry, work’s been crazy. I couldn’t get away.”

His body pressed against mine, his breath warm on my skin, but I felt cold inside.

Resentment bubbled up in me.

I gently pushed him away and spoke casually.

“I’ve changed my mind. Wearing the ring would show how much we care about each other.”

“Kason, where’s my ring?”

I held out my hand, making it clear what I wanted.

Kason hesitated, his face unreadable.

In that moment, I felt like I was falling into a frozen pit.

I already knew what he was going to say.

Sure enough, after a pause, he pursed his lips, his tone almost begging.

“Luisa, I think that ring’s outdated. It doesn’t suit you.”

“How about we pick out a new one? I know a place with some gorgeous designs…”

I shook my head, cutting him off. “Never mind, it’s not important anymore.”

Even though I’d expected it, the truth still hurt.

A flash of panic crossed Kason’s face. He grabbed my hand tightly, speaking quickly.

“Luisa, are you mad at me?”

“Why wouldn’t it be important?”

“We’re about to get married. You can’t scare me like this. I’ll get you a better one right away.”

Kason’s voice kept echoing in my ears, but all I felt was disgust.

“It’s fine, I’m not mad. Just take me out to dinner to make it up to me.”

Kason immediately relaxed. “I’ll take you now.”

Looking at his relieved expression, I suddenly wondered.

If he knew I’d already decided to leave him, would he still be so calm?

Chapter 3

In the restaurant, Kason Henry thoughtfully cut the steak for me and placed it in front of me. He then called the waiter to pour me some warm water. However, the person who arrived looked familiar—it was Ximena Mills. When she saw me, she flaunted the diamond ring on her finger with a smirk. Kason frowned, glanced at Ximena, and spoke coldly. ""After pouring the water, leave. Don’t linger."" Ximena stormed off in anger.

Kason stayed by my side, but it was clear his mind was elsewhere. He kept fidgeting, his gaze distant. Finally, he squeezed my hand and stood up. ""Luisa, I’ll be right back. I need to use the restroom."" I nodded and watched him walk away.

A few minutes later, I received a message from Ximena. ""Come to the restroom."" I pushed open the restroom door and heard their voices from one of the stalls. Kason said in a hushed tone, ""Don’t show up in front of Luisa again. I’ll give you whatever you want."" Ximena purred, ""Then I want you to spend the night with me."" Kason sighed, seemingly relenting. ""Fine, but I need to go home and be with Luisa first.""

The moment the words left his mouth, I closed the door and walked out of the restaurant. I then sent a message to my arranged marriage partner, Ronan Cooper. ""Didn’t you say the wedding dress arrived? I’ll go try it on now.""

When I returned home, Kason was pacing anxiously. Seeing me, he pulled me into a tight embrace. ""Luisa, where did you go? I’ve been looking for you everywhere."" I pushed him away and walked to the couch. Thinking of the wedding dress I had just tried on, I smiled slightly and said, ""I went to try on the wedding dress.""

Kason seemed pleased, his tense body relaxing. He spoke softly, ""Luisa, I know you’re excited about our wedding. But next time, don’t just leave without saying anything, okay?"" I nodded gently, not arguing. But I didn’t tell him that the wedding dress I tried on wasn’t for our wedding. After all, in just one day, I would leave him. While he walked into the wedding hall with someone else, I would also marry someone else.

Kason knelt down, his face pressed against my knees. From this angle, I could see the red marks on the back of his neck. ""Luisa, I’ve had a ring made for you."" The diamond was enormous, and the craftsmanship was exquisite. It was clear Kason had put a lot of thought into it. But I wasn’t as excited as I once would have been. Instead, I smiled and handed the ring box back to him. ""Give it to me at the wedding.""

Kason didn’t notice my indifference. He looked at me with the same love as before. But I knew he wasn’t the same man who only loved me anymore. And I wasn’t the same woman who only loved him.

My phone rang, and when Kason saw the caller ID, a flicker of panic crossed his eyes. ""Luisa, the company has some urgent matters to attend to during the holidays. I need to go back and check on things. You go to sleep; don’t wait for me."" I nodded obediently and watched him rush out. As the sound of his car engine faded, I slowly stood up and began packing my things.

When there was no trace of me left in the villa, I finally let out a long breath. I opened my phone and saw a boastful message from Ximena. ""Tomorrow, Mr. Henry is throwing me a wedding even grander than yours. Take a look at the wedding dress he bought for me—it’s even more expensive than yours."" I smirked and calmly replied, ""What a coincidence. My wedding is tomorrow too.""

Then I placed the printed chat records on the coffee table and walked downstairs. Outside, a Maybach was waiting, and the distinguished man inside had been there for a while. I got into the car, glanced at the villa where I had lived for so long, and closed my eyes. Kason Henry, from now on, we’re strangers.

Coffee

Watermelon sometimes

[21M],"I’m 21 years old and wanted to ask about some recent heart flutters I’ve noticed. I started drinking energy drinks in college and kept the habit after graduating when I got a corporate job that required early mornings. I also work out about four times per week, and since I was always tired after work, I started relying on caffeine to push through workouts. Over time, that turned into a pretty strong energy drink habit—usually one drink per day (160–300 mg of caffeine), but sometimes up to three on really tired days (around 600 mg total, though that wasn’t every day). About two weeks ago, while sitting at my desk drinking one, I felt a single brief flutter in my chest that caught my attention. The next day, during cardio, I felt another short flutter and got nervous enough to stop and go home. There was no pain, dizziness, or shortness of breath beyond normal exercise fatigue.

Since that day, I’ve quit caffeine cold turkey. For about a week I completely cut out energy drinks, soda, coffee, and tea. Since then, I’ve noticed the palpitations less often—they still happen occasionally but are infrequent and brief, lasting less than a second. None have come with pain, dizziness, or shortness of breath. The most caffeine I’ve had in a day since quitting was about 205 mg (from a couple of sugar-free Mountain Dews and a lightly caffeinated sparkling water), and I didn’t notice any issues afterward. Sometimes I feel a vague sensation in my chest that I could describe as mild discomfort, but it doesn’t actually hurt, and I honestly wonder if I’m just psyching myself out and it’s not really there. I usually only notice it when I’m thinking about the whole thing. My plan was to stay off caffeine for about six weeks to let my body reset and then reintroduce it in moderation (no more than one drink every two days, max three per week). I’d just like to know if what I’m describing sounds concerning enough to see a doctor or if this is something benign that I can keep monitoring.",1,1760112534.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

Seeing all the posts regarding Pilot Iroshizuku’s Fuyu-Syogun, convinced me to try this ink, and I’m really glad I did. It’s a lovely ink, reminding me of some of the atmospheric inks for Lennon Tool Bar, who’s Cloudy Day is one of my all-time favorites, not the least of which it is also a permanent ink. Fuyu-Syogun is not a permanent ink, but it does have a surprising amount of water resistance.

Swatching Inks has been a nice pleasant way to decompress and relax, sort of like gardening, or hand-washing a vehicle, I would imagine, though I don’t do those things nearly as much anymore, hence the Ink Swatching :) 

I got to play with my Sailor Horcoro dip nibs, as well as ink two pens with Fuyu-Syogun—a Pilot Falcon SEF (metal), and my Lamy Safari Broad.

The ink flow is good in both pens and very easy to use in terms of dip pens. 

The color is just beautiful—a haunting grey with deep purple undertones that gives it a stormy weather feeling and makes it stand out on the page, while still retaining its muted expression.

In terms of water resistance, I was pleasantly surprised by how well it held up on Rhodia 80 gsm paper. 

All in all, a beautiful ink that works well with different nibs, very readable and expressive on the page.

About me:

1) I speak Russian and English.

2) I don’t drink, smoke, or go clubbing. I’m in bed by 10pm.

3) I love cinema (especially horror, drama, mystery thrillers) and my work is kinda connected to film. Do you have a Letterboxd account? In my dream scenario we’d have cozy movie nights together. I also enjoy reading books in the same genres.

4) I wouldn’t say that I’m very feminine when it comes to fashion and makeup, but I love the idea of going to markets or thrift stores (I’ve never thrifted anything in my life) together, browsing, and pointing out cute things. I enjoy just awkwardly walking around shopping malls without buying anything.

5) I’m all for going on simple walks or to cafés or museums/exhibitions. I don’t drink coffee but I like tea.

It had been six months since my last flare up and I thought that everything was going great (eating lots of fiber, low red meat intake, low alcohol intake, etc) but then BAM!  Symptoms started on Tuesday evening and had me in pain with chills.  I’ve been intermittently using Tylenol and ibuprofen to combat the pain and they seem to keep me good. 

So I took the advice of many on here and started a fast at 7pm on Wednesday evening. It has now been 38 hours without any food (water, black coffee, and chicken broth only) and I have to say…is this for real and working?  The pain is almost gone now and I didn’t even have to take pain meds this morning.  Of course I’m hungry, but I’d much rather deal with hunger than dv pain, another trip to the hospital, and another round of Cipro & Flagyl. 

Anyone here had any success with taking the fast out to 72 hours and seeing their flare up disappear?

Curious to hear.

Mindset is honestly everything. You can have the skills, the tools, even the opportunities, but if your head isn’t in the right place, it feels like you’re just spinning in circles.

So I wanted to write this down *“seven ways I’ve been learning to upgrade my mindset.”*

Think of this less as a “self-help checklist” and more like advice from a friend who reminds you that you’re capable of more than you think.

It’s so easy to only get excited about the *final result,* the campaign launching, the art finished, the approval email. But the upgrade happens when you start loving the in-between moments. The rough drafts, the messy brainstorming, even the late-night “I have no idea if this will work” thoughts. When you start seeing the process as the actual art, you stop rushing, and you start enjoying.

# 2. surround yourself with inspiring energy

Mindset shifts when your environment shifts. And no, that doesn’t mean you need to move to Paris tomorrow (though, yes, that would be chic). It means curating your space with energy that fuels you books, playlists, Pinterest boards, the people you talk to. Who and what you let into your space becomes the background music of your mindset.

# 3. say no to noise

An upgraded mindset isn’t about doing *more*; it’s about choosing *better*. Every time you say yes to something that drains you, you’re saying no to your creative energy. Get comfortable saying no, even to opportunities that “look good on paper” but don’t align with who you are becoming. That’s how you create mental clarity.

# 4. play with perspective

I think one of the biggest creative flexes is being able to zoom in and zoom out. When you’re stuck, ask yourself: “Am I too close to this? Or too far away?” Switching perspective makes you realize that most blocks are just angles. Change the angle, and suddenly things click.

# 5. invest in your taste

Mindset isn’t just “be positive.” It’s also about what you feed your brain. Upgrade your inputs: read better books, watch films that move you, explore art outside your comfort zone. Taste is something you can train, and the more refined your taste gets, the sharper your mindset becomes.

# 6. let yourself be a beginner again

This is a hard one, but it’s important. An upgraded mindset isn’t about being the best at everything, it’s about being brave enough to be a beginner again. To try, to mess up, to not look polished, to learn. Every time you let yourself be new at something, you’re expanding who you are.

# 7. build rituals, not routines

Routines can feel rigid, like a schedule you’re forced into. Rituals feel sacred, like you’re choosing them. Turn little daily things into rituals—your morning coffee, your journaling, even how you shut down your laptop at night. Rituals anchor your mindset and remind you that creativity is woven into the ordinary.

At the end of the day, mindset upgrades aren’t giant leaps. They’re small shifts that add up. And when you treat your mind with the same care you treat your work, everything around you starts to feel lighter, freer, more aligned.",1,1760112118.0,CosmosCreative,0,1.0,False

That is my preferred type of date, but, specially in online dating, many girls won't like the idea of going out for drinks, specially if the guy didn't waste time meeting eachother through text, as 3% men do. That's why I wonder if a coffee first date is as bad as Corey says.

Tbh many people do coffee as first dates, specially when being younger, it's something that often works.

What if you do coffee as a first date and then go for drinks the next dates? I've never done it, I guess it slows down the process, but do you think it could be worth it?

1o34te5,https://i.redd.it/g0ppej5z3buf1.png,Mike Dewine Hemp Ban Emergency Order,"Governor DeWine’s emergency order banning intoxicating hemp products may be framed as a public safety measure, but it’s built on assumptions and fear rather than evidence and understanding. The real danger here isn’t hemp... it’s the reflex to control what we don’t fully comprehend with government overreach. Hemp is not a ""loophole"" or a ""threat"" It’s a plant recognized under federal law for its agricultural and therapeutic value. The cannabinoids being targeted, Delta-8, HHC, and similar derivatives aren’t synthetic narcotics like the RCs (research chems of the last 2 decades)... they’re naturally occurring compounds refined through chemistry, its no different than how caffeine is distilled from coffee or aspirin from willow bark. The issue isn’t the plant or the molecule , it’s the absence of clear, consistent regulation and instead of addressing that gap, this order chooses the easy route... prohibition.

Haven't we learned anything? Blanket bans don’t solve problems they just create vacuums. They force responsible business owners, (those who test, label, and verify), into the same category as careless operators. They drive commerce underground and hand the market to unregulated vendors with no incentive to follow safety standards. Meanwhile, small Ohio businesses like farmers, manufacturers, and local retailers lose inventory, income, and credibility overnight.

As a parent, I get it, but if the concern is child safety, there are rational tools available, like enforcing child resistant packaging, ID verification, and transparent labeling. Educate uninformed parents and regulate these products with clarity. I rarely indulge anymore but common sense tells me that none of this requires declaring a “state of emergency” over legal, federally recognized products. That phrase should be reserved for actual crises, not political discomfort.

The order claims intoxicating hemp poses a “serious threat” because of its similarity to marijuana. But similarity isn’t harm and Marijuana has been proven to be one of the most safest mind altering compounds. Comparatively, alcohol, caffeine, nicotine all psychoactive, are all regulated. We don’t just go and ban them... we manage them. Why should cannabinoids be any different?

This move also sidesteps legislative debate. Lawmaking is meant to be deliberate, collective, and accountable. Emergency powers are for floods, outbreaks, and imminent danger, not complex policy discussions that deserve transparency and time. When one branch of government unilaterally halts an entire industry, it undermines trust in democratic process. This order isn’t protecting people, just their perception. It signals authority instead of wisdom and sends a chilling message to innovators and entrepreneurs ""if your success becomes politically inconvenient, it can be erased"". 

Requireing lab certification and contaminant testing, mandating accurate THC content disclosures, enforcing packaging that distinguishes adult products from candy, and penalize those who ignore the rules... Regulation builds trust while prohibition builds resentment.

Hemp isn’t a threat to Ohio, our tyrannical government with too much overreach is. This order solves nothing while sacrificing so much, especially with all the program cuts by the current administration, jobs are lost, opportunities are squandered, our infrastructure from the tax money back to the black market and crime syndicates that aren't paying taxes,  trust me.  Meanwhile the principle that law should be guided by reason, not reaction is completely overlooked. We deserve a government that governs with understanding and tries to work with its people, not against them.

TLDR (definitely don't blame you, the AuDHD is real here) - I've been catching feelings for one of my best friends for years and ignoring them out of fear. Feelings are getting stronger and I am scared. I think I need time to work on myself, and I would break if I lost him so I have never said anything. I have no idea how he feels about me but I don't wanna ask. Help me suppress this nonsense please!!!

Here we go.

Yeah, I'm probably the five BILLIONTH person to ask about suppressing feelings since the dawn of time. I know. But it's so hard trying to figure out what to do here.

TW!!!! TW!!!! ...Suicidal thoughts mention, abuse mention, SA mention... and a very long AuDHD ramble, particularly at the end (I'm so very very sorry, but my brain cannot figure out what to cut right now because it currently says every detail is important... TL;DR is at the start, apologies again 😭)

I (27NB) have had a relatively crappy track record in my relationship history (mainly just crappy taste in men) since I started dating my first boyfriend in tenth grade. I'm not proud of it. The start of it back in high school was just a lot of emotions thrown around when we all didn't know what we were doing yet, but it kinda just kept getting worse, and I have been the target of controlling and abusive relationships/situationships on more than one occasion.

My last relationship (1.5 years) ended over this past summer and I know I need to take time to heal and work on myself because I think that relationship ended in part because I didn't take almost any real time to heal and process my issues and thoughts from the significant trauma that has happened in the last two partnerships before that; a 3.5 year relationship with my emotionally abusive ex-fiance, and a five-month manipulative situationship with someone who was really, really good at the whole lying and manipulating thing, coerced me into sexual situations I wouldn't have agreed to normally, potentially SA'd me [still processing that one], and nearly tore apart one of my friend groups. It all kind of happened in quicker succession than I knew how to deal with (it's complicated), and I think I clung to the person I had dated because they felt safe. But I hadn't actually known this person long enough to really understand what my feelings for them could be; I knew them for less than a year before we started dating, and I do care for and adore them, but I would far rather be friends. Once my excitement and clinging and ""honeymoon phase"" feelings were over, I realized that quickly. There were other incompatibilities, but we just seemed to be two different people whose lives, mental/physical health needs, and lifestyles didn't match up in this context. 

Anyway, trauma aside (lol I wish), the real complication right now comes in the form of one of my best friends (26M). Cliche, I know, it's always a best friend isn't it? Let's call him Spencer. 

Spencer and I have been friends for a much longer time than I have known any of my previous partners, or even many of my current friends. We've known each other since around the middle of high school (for nine years of which we've been close/good friends), and he is the only person from our mutual friend group that has purposely and specifically kept in regular contact with me since we graduated. Even through months or years where one or both of us were struggling, we still exchanged the occasional meme and tried to catch up a bit, even if it was only over text. We've never gone a particularly long time without talking. We've never been on bad terms and the line of communication was just always casually open. We've just always been there for each other, really.

Cut to now. I am coming out of a deep period of illness and depression. I am working on myself like I had promised myself I would, and I am genuinely doing far better than I was even a month ago. I am getting better sleep, have better eating habits, and am getting decent exercise (which is better than the ""none"" I had before). I am drinking more water and socializing more. I have never been this motivated and this eager to practice self-care.

And it is, truly without exaggeration, in no small part thanks to Spencer. He's been encouraging me to leave the house more, has been inviting me to hang out with our old friends with him for months despite me not being able to join until recently with the issues I had going on -- and there was no expectation or harshness for all the times that I couldn't go, just a gentle open invitation and a reminder on the days they had something on. He brought me to the gym with him last week, too, with two of our other friends, and was gladly showing me some routines and how some of the equipment worked. He's never made me feel bad for not knowing something or not being able to do something (as a disabled person, it's sadly less rare than it should be). 

We've been talking regularly again for months, and we've gotten a lot closer, like how we were in high school. We've been talking even more in these past 5-6 or so weeks that I've been working harder on myself, and he's been incredibly supportive. He's been one of the few sorts of people where if one of us suggests ""hey, let's go for a walk at the river"" or ""hey, let's go for coffee"", it'll actually happen. He was the first one to specifically say ""oh, hey, that workshop you said you're attending is close to my work, want to grab lunch?"" six weeks ago, and the hangouts continued from there. 

This isn't the first time Spencer has helped me feel so much more stable in such a chaotic time, either. When I was at the peak of my high school suicidal thoughts, and nearly ended up admitted to the hospital, he was one of the few people I told about it at the time, and he was texting with me the entire time I was in the Emergency Room, checking up on me and sending me stupid jokes and memes to try to keep me cheered and distracted. He kept checking up on me for days afterwards, and would always teasingly but sincerely tell me ""don't die"", and that I was ""not allowed to die"" (pretty sure he even wrote it in my yearbook).

Honestly, my friendship with Spencer is one of, if not the top of, the most stable friendships I've ever had in my life, or even of stable relationships across multiple contexts. He's been there for me through a lot of crap and despite anything that's happened, despite the fact that he's seen me at my worst, despite me being disabled, despite the mess of teenage moods and adult chaos, he's never made me feel like I'm anything less than a good person and a good friend and a fun companion to spend time with. I'm never ""less than"" when I'm with Spencer. I'm never ""the one that can't do XYZ"". It's never ""well, they probably can't do that, so let's not bother inviting them or telling them we're hanging out"". Our mutual friend group is really good for trying to find things I can do, but Spencer is always the one most on top of it, and he's good at it when we hang out alone, too.

Thus... my dilemma. 

My feelings for him are growing from platonic to something very obviously deeper and more intimate, shifting and blooming into something that could be beautiful if it could go somewhere but is stuck inside a lockbox... again. I say ""again"" because this has happened before. Like, a lot. To varying degrees in unpredictable waves since high school, dependent on how frequently we're talking at the time. I've just sort of squashed down the feelings every time for some reason or another (ranging from ""he's moved out of town right now"" to ""I'm in a relationship right now""... or, really, ""there's no way he feels that way about me"" usually). The feelings have definitely never been this strong or this deep, and I truly don't know how to get rid of them or squish them back down this time. I don't even know if I should.

My brain's dilemma goes with this. In theory, we're both single, and we get along incredibly well. I'm AFAB NB, and I openly go by they/any pronouns (mainly they/she), and he's very casual and respectful of this. He's also very open overall (we have a lot of queer and neurodivergent friends, and we are also both neurodivergent), and has described an ideal for a partner as ""woman or woman-adjacent"" and has specifically stated a fondness for she/they folks... yes, specifically, straight to me, directly, in a one-on-one conversation, knowing my pronouns. My brain likes to try to read into that one, I really doubt it's actually ""something"" but it won't shut up about it. I have it in here so y'all understand what my brain is picking at.

But like....... why not, right? Unfortunately I feel like my reasons for ""why not"" feel obvious and are valid in halting me in my hopes and thoughts. 

I KNOW I need healing time. So much healing. And I'm in therapy, I'm getting my Master's towards my dream job, and am working hard on myself currently and it's really sticking this time. I am confident that I'm actually on a recovery and discovery path for the first time even if/when I stumble along the way. I've been disabled my whole life and I've never felt this confident that I can actually do better for myself and feel BETTER despite being permanently disabled. It's never felt this upward before. And I don't think it would be this positive without Spencer.

I know that, in theory, I can work on myself and heal while in a relationship with someone. But I've tried that, a few times, and it's... not gone over very well. In a couple of contexts,  it's actually gone horribly wrong and become an abusive/manipulative situation. It's been proven to me that sometimes being in a relationship where both parties need healing can be incomparably stressful (especially with men who won't go to therapy; ""I can fix him"" indeed), and the efforts I make are not returned equally, and I end up stressed and exhausted and angry and depressed, and it makes a lot of my illness/disability symptoms flare, and I feel worse, and I end up in a horrible place. 

But then again, nothing has EVER felt so effortless as spending time with, or talking to, Spencer. I've never felt like I had to put in more than I was receiving in our friendship. It's never felt one-sided. If I don't message first in the mornings, he will. Even if it's a meme or something to start a conversation. He actively engages in our conversations, whether it's in-person or over text. The last time we hung out as a large group, he seemed to keep drifting back to me, to check up on how I was doing (my neurodivergent brain doesn't much like new people and there were five people I didn't know out of the dozen or so that were there and he kept asking me how I was feeling or if I was overwhelmed), to just chill and talk, to make sure I was drinking water, or whatever it happened to be. He's a solid and attentive friend, and I couldn't ask for more in terms of someone who doesn't seem like he would ever make me feel like I'm doing things all myself or trying to do the work and healing of two people at once. 

Plus, Spencer has already been in therapy, and he's already (independently of any relationship or whatever) working on himself, taking care of his health, practicing self-care. People who've dated men will understand this feels like striking gold, right? He's a wonderful person and an incredible friend and he would be an amazing partner to someone.

But y'all, I would be absolutely crushed to lose him by trying to say I want to be that partner. I can't do it. I cannot take that risk.

I don't want to ruin our friendship by saying anything stupid. I don't want to scare him away or make anything awkward. I don't want him to think I'm trying to get close and spend time with him just in the hopes of dating or something because that feels disgusting and predatory and its nowhere close to the truth. I spend time with him because I want to spend time with him. I enjoy his company. He is a good person and a good friend. Those feelings don't change that fact. 

But I feel so scared of fucking up one of the greatest things that has ever happened to me. So maybe if I can just... get rid of these feelings again or something?? They've been squashed down before (for almost nine years here and there), I'm sure it can happen again, right?

I just... I can't lose Spencer, y'all. Losing him would be horrible, especially right now as he's helping me so much, even if he may not realize how much of a difference it makes, or how much his seemingly effortless actions are making my recovery feel so much more smooth and supported. I don't think I could ever express enough how much he's helping me and I doubt he even knows how deeply it's affecting me. He's become a more crucial part of my life than ever, and I would be so, so angry at myself if I fucked it up in any way, or if I hurt him. 

But I adore him so damn much. We get along so well and we can talk about basically anything. We exchange stupid memes, silly reels, and we've introduced each other to new media by way of endlessly harassing the other to watch the thing... okay, actually, that may just mainly be me having caved into watching Dimension 20 because of his ""bullying"" as I teasingly call it. I've suggested things too, of course, but it's mainly him trying to excitedly and neurodivergently share his fixations, and me wanting to see more things that make him happy. We play a good amount of the same video games, and we're both open to trying the faves of the other if we haven't already. We like a lot of the same shows/movies/etc, and are both particularly obsessed with LOTR. 

We have very similar senses of humour, and we both like to roast and tease people as a love language including each other. One specific thing that makes me feel more comfortable with him, and with our mutual friend group, is that nobody seems to be afraid of making jokes about my disabilities and illnesses. Most of the time when people say something forgetting about what I can't do, it's followed up with a dramatic apology that makes me feel irritated or awkward. Last time Spencer casually said something and I mentioned not being able to do part of what he said, he grinned at me and said, ""Skill issue."" and I nearly pissed myself laughing. Most of our friends are like that, and it makes me feel more included to be teased for my limits than for people to dance around them like landmines. Spencer is, as a rarity among people I know, really quite good about making me feel cared about and included in part BECAUSE of my illnesses and disabilities and not in SPITE of them; he doesn't hold back on questions if he doesn't understand something, he doesn't treat it like a taboo topic or an elephant in the room. He still doesn't fully understand everything (hell, my doctors and I barely do) but he never shies away from trying or complains about limitations of what we can do together. That's been really rare for me. Other disabled people and spoonies will understand that.

And really... hell, we just talk openly about a lot of things, anytime. I know there's still more we don't know about each other, because there always seems to be more, but everything I learn just seems to keep solidly and logically adding pieces and building blocks to the person I already know, and it makes me understand him better, and I love learning new things about him because of that. I love knowing him. I love talking to him. I love spending time with him. I love seeing his smile when we talk, or even make eye contact across a room or over a bonfire pit. I love hearing his laugh. I love learning more of his quirks and triggers because I want to be a stable person for him the way he is for me. And I love the way he jams out to his music when he's driving, tapping his fingers on the wheel and bobbing his head (at red lights of course), and I love the grin he has on his face when he catches me watching him jam out. 

And I also love seeing him talk with our other friends and get excited about things. In the past I've sometimes been a jealous and possessive sort of person, where I've felt FOMO in every context ever with anyone from my mom (sorry to my older brother and sister), to a partner, to my friends, but it's been changing lately and I don't ever feel it with Spencer. Honestly I don't think I ever have. I want him to have friends, enjoy himself, be happy, be excited, get passionate and riled up about things, roast our other friends for the choices they make in the games we play. I don't want him to only talk to me. I want to see him enjoy himself. I don't feel like he needs to include me in everything. I just feel amazing and cared about when he does (which happens far more often now that I've been recovering enough to leave the house more; I've seen him minimum once a week for the last month). 

I've only ever had a little twinge of jealousy with him once that I can recall at all, ever, which was a few weeks ago when he said he had just gone on a casual date with someone he met on a dating app. He didn't seem all that enthused about it (he's not had great luck with dates), but I didn't press him for a ton of details -- all I know is that it hurt just a tiny bit. I wished I could have gone out with him in a date context. But if he finds some cute girl and chooses to date her, marry her, have a family with her, I wouldn't be mad. I barely feel jealous or envious or anything at the thought. Just a bittersweet vibe of wishing I was in that role, but far more strongly hoping that wherever he ends up, he is happy, and hoping that I'm still in his life as at least a friend, for as long as I can be, until the world stops spinning. I know I've tried to pretend the same for others before, because I know caring for someone and loving them is supposed to feel selfless, but I've always either felt way more jealous or way closer to indifference than I ""should"" if I thought about a partner or potential partner growing old with someone else. 

Sometimes I question if my feelings may be reciprocal or not, like the comment about she/theys I mentioned, or the checking up on me while we were all hanging out, or helping me at the gym and checking up on me there too and making sure I had water and stuff and felt comfortable, or wanting to hang out just one-on-one even for something as simple as running errands... Last weekend he wanted some company in the afternoon so I came with him to get new shoes and then we sat at the waterfront park for lunch together, and then the same day was the day we all hung out with those new people, so honestly I figured he'd probably be sick of me by then but he really didn't seem to be as per the checking up on me and hanging out together parts, so that was nice.

But for real? This dorky cute little idiot (affectionately) could absolutely do better. He's an absolute catch. He's incredibly good-looking (he has literally the nicest hair in the world and very soft and sweet eyes) and he is sweet and thoughtful and all those other things I've said already but I could say a thousand times. And in comparison... yeah I'm hot, but I am also certainly a hot MESS. I have a lot of baggage and trauma and mental and physical health issues that I would bring to the table that I wouldn't really blame someone for not wanting to deal with. My self-esteem is on the rise lately, but I still don't particularly feel like I would deserve him. I don't know if I will ever feel like I would deserve him. He's not even one-in-a-million -- he's way more than that. The earth's population is like 8 billion and something, right? So he's certainly one in 8 billion and something. I think he's the most incredible, safe, comfortable, lovely, patient, magnificent person I know, or that I will ever know. 

I don't even know how to fully describe how I feel about him. Every other crush or relationship or love I have ever had has started like a spark, has had something that burns, that feels like friendship set on fire in an exciting way. Something passionate in a way that feels like fireworks that are bright and loud and beautiful, or like birthday candles that mean joy and excitement and being important just for a day, or like an old fireplace in a large cold cabin that stands out and feels like comfort from a harsh environment but really only heats when you stand close to it rather than helping you all around. Every light that I've had before has gone out. ""Honeymoon phases"" are way too real.

But a light that knows its limits? That's not Spencer. Spencer's light feels so different. Spencer doesn't have those limits. Spencer is like a campfire on a cooling summer night, familiar and safe and warm and bright, with comfort and activities and relaxation and friends and jokes and love all around him, with so many possibilities and yet one stable presence in the middle of it, with a light that can burn forever as long as you stay with it and nurture it, with warmth that spreads to everyone and envelopes like a hug.  

Spencer is like coming home to candles of your favourite scent lit by your favourite place to sit and relax, with a cup of hot cocoa and your favourite show or game already ready to go for you, with your favourite dinner on the way, with the promise of current and future comfort and love and care, with the smells and tastes and sights and feelings that mean the most to you. Spencer is like the stars in the sky, burning bright and beautiful, helping you get to the place you need to be, there with you every step of the way and beyond, with a presence that's stable and constant and breathtaking. 

Spencer is like the moon, amazing and gorgeous and the most wonderful thing the sky has to offer (imo), a wondrous piece of nature that's familiar and shining just as bright and beautiful as any star even if it can't be seen, a force that's able to be there in any way you need, a mysterious marvel that legitimately takes your breath away when it shines its best. Spencer is like a firefly, a miracle and a wonder and a gorgeous sight to behold, a delicate creature that needs love and care as much as you do, a light that shines whether you are there or not, but maybe he just wants to shine for you anyway. Spencer is like the reflection of the sun and the moon on a lake, a light that cannot be taken away easily, a light that can remind you of youth and excitement but also provide calmness and comfort and relaxation, something that brings with it a promise of life, joy, nourishment, anxiety, ease, and home all at once.

Being with Spencer feels like I set a very deep friendship on fire, but the fire is burning proper kindling rather than a trash pile or just things I found around the pit that are flammable. It's like the fire is there to slowly grow, to keep me warm and steady and ready to go, to keep me safe and comfortable. It'll burn, it feels hot, it IS hot, and I love the heat of it, but it's also there for functionality and warmth and strength rather than for light and entertainment. I don't know when the spark happened. I can't pinpoint even a time in high school where I first thought ""oh, I have feelings for Spencer"". I just know it's been burning a long time; comfortable, stable, waiting in the back of my soul as patient as Spencer himself. 

...dammit, that was long-winded as hell. I'm really down bad, aren't I? 

Ugh. Reddit. Please help. How do I stop feeling like this? How do I push it down this time when it's so strong? I don't want to scare or hurt Spencer, I don't want to ruin anything, and I definitely don't want to lose him. SOS ",1,1760111612.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

Layla Phillips had never experienced pain like this before.  
  
The sound of flesh tearing roared in her ears, mixed with the metallic tang of blood. Her legs gave out, her hands were gone—she didn't even know where they had fallen—and her throat, ripped open, could no longer produce a sound.  
  
""Crazy bitch, get off me.""  
  
A man's panicked voice fought against her weight, trying to shove Layla away.  
  
Her eyelids, glued shut by heavy layers of blood, refused to open. She should have been dead already. Yet, somehow, she kept hanging on, and latched onto the man beneath her with everything she had left.  
  
This was her enemy, the man who had killed her mother, the one she hated with every ounce of her being.  
  
The mutated beast gnawing at Layla wasn't about to let the prey beneath her escape. Drawn by the scent of fresh blood, more creatures swarmed in, tearing into him with ravenous delight.  
  
The man's screams grew weaker, fading into silence. The necklace around Layla's neck was snapped off in the chaos.  
  
\*\*\*\*\*\*  
  
A burst of strange light flashed before her eyes. The searing pain vanished, replaced by a warm, unfamiliar energy. Dazed, like a newborn, she stiffened. Her eyes flew open.  
  
What she saw made her heart lurch—she was back in the office of the internet company she once worked for. On the wall hung the old company slogan, ""Innovation, Struggle, Infinite Future.""  
  
Just across the wall, employees tapped away at their keyboards, their faces buried in screens. Coffee cups were lifted for absentminded sips between clicks.  
  
She raised her hand. The slender fingers, the polished nails, the delicate woven bracelet on her wrist—this wasn't her hand.  
  
At least, it was not the blood-stained, scarred hands she had lived with in the apocalypse.  
  
What was happening? Had she really time-traveled? Back from that brutal, hopeless wasteland where only the ruthless survived?  
  
She had fought through ten long years of the apocalypse.  
  
Scorching heat waves, endless torrential rain, and lethal cold fronts had wiped out cities, reducing the global population by seventy percent.  
  
Earthquakes and supervolcano eruptions destroyed the shelters humanity depended on, drenching the world in acid rain.  
  
Under volcanic ash, the earth was plunged into eternal darkness and freezing temperatures.  
  
Resources vanished. Animals and plants mutated. Viruses spread unchecked.  
  
But the worst threat wasn't nature. It was humanity itself—stripped of law and morality, revealing raw, naked cruelty.  
  
Her thoughts spun wildly. A moment ago, she had been ripped apart by a mutated monster, the agony still vivid in her bones. Yet in the blink of an eye, she was here again.  
  
This was before the end began. She had time-traveled.  
  
""Layla? Layla? Are you even listening to me?"" A familiar male voice snapped her out of her daze. The sound stabbed at her chest like a blade, dredging up memories soaked in blood and hatred.  
  
She lifted her head and came face-to-face with a man who wore a bright, handsome smile.  
  
""Your design represents our team in the competition. What difference does it make if you win or Emily wins? If you keep pushing this, you'll drag everyone down with you. If it blows up, even the company could get dragged into it. Can you handle that kind of responsibility?""  
  
In that instant, everything came flooding back.  
  
The man in front of her was Logan Johnson, her project team leader, four years older than her.  
  
And she was just a fresh-faced newbie, barely surviving the brutal grind of 996. Naïve. Foolish.  
  
Logan's occasional kindness had tricked her into believing he was different, that maybe there was something between them.  
  
She thought they were secretly seeing each other. But the truth? She was just one of the many girls he had his eye on.  
  
And this so-called sunny, reliable man? He was nothing more than Emily Smith's devoted lapdog.  
  
Emily, the boss' illegitimate daughter, had joined the company around the same time as Layla, but spent her days idly scrolling on her phone or fixing her makeup.  
  
Most of their colleagues didn't know her true identity. They thought she was the boss' mistress instead, and one by one, they bent over backward to curry her favor. Logan was no exception.  
  
That wasn't even the worst part. Emily was lazy, too lazy to work, too lazy to create. She wanted to steal Layla's designs and pass them off as her own, so she sent Logan to steal her USB drive. The only reason he had pursued Layla in the first place was for Emily's sake.  
  
Layla lifted her eyes, cold and sharp, fixing Logan with a stare. He was still rambling on.  
  
""And think about it. I'm the one managing this project. If you make a scene, I'll get dragged into it, too. Can you really stand by and watch me—""  
  
""Why the hell should I care?"" Layla suddenly cut him off.  
  
Logan froze.  
  
Just a second ago, she'd looked like she was on the verge of tears—easy prey, easy to manipulate. But now, in an instant, her voice and her gaze had turned razor-sharp.  
  
For the first time, Logan felt a chill crawl down his spine.  
  
What he didn't know was that just moments ago, he had been dancing at death's door without even realizing it.  
  
Layla had survived ten years in a world drowned in darkness, living each day on the knife's edge. She had spilled so much blood that she'd lost count long ago.  
  
Right now, she looked like nothing more than an ordinary office worker.  
  
But underneath that façade, she was a demon wrapped in human skin—her hands trained to kill as easily as chopping vegetables.  
  
One quick glance around the office, and she knew she could make do with anything—a metal keyboard, the kettle on the desk, a chair, a thermos, even a fruit knife. She was fully confident she could pick any one of them up and crack his skull open in a heartbeat.  
  
In the apocalypse, she held on to her last breath just so she could drag Logan down with her, her hands locked around his throat as mutated beasts tore them both apart.  
  
But this wasn't the apocalypse. Not yet. Society hadn't collapsed. The order was still intact. If she killed him now, she'd just end up in prison. This could cause her a lot of trouble.  
  
She would deal with him later.  
  
With that thought, Layla turned on her heel and walked away, ignoring Logan's stunned expression.  
  
She sat down at her desk, closed her eyes, and forced herself to organize her thoughts.  
  
Her coworkers, having watched her spat with Logan, quickly turned away. Still, the whispers spread like wildfire.  
  
Of course, Layla knew Emily was the office's it-girl. And Layla—foolish, stubborn Layla—was the only one dumb enough to pick a fight with her.  
  
""Unbelievable. I just hope she doesn't drag us down and make Emily look down on our team.""  
  
""Let's stay out of it. She's just jealous. She can't compete with Emily. Emily's prettier, dresses better, comes from a good family, and she's talented, too. She submitted work the moment she joined.""  
  
""Blaming Emily won't change anything. It's not her fault. Layla wasn't born into the right family.""  
  
Layla didn't so much as flinch. She tuned out every word, opened her browser, and scanned the news, the updates, the calendar—over and over again. She needed to be absolutely sure she really had time-traveled.      



**Chapter 2 Compensation**



It was June. Only two months remained before the apocalypse. In two months, the already unbearable summer heat would grow even harsher, temperatures skyrocketing until countless people collapsed and died in the sweltering air. And that was only the beginning.  
  
Since God had given Layla a second chance, she would never be the pathetic fool she once was.  
  
This time, she would be prepared. And for that, she needed money.  
  
Layla wasn't some heiress with billions in her account, able to stockpile supplies on a whim. Her savings barely scraped together fifty grand.  
  
So her top priority was clear, and that was to get money. Whatever it took.  
  
She opened her laptop and created an encrypted spreadsheet, carefully drafting a list of everything she would need.  
  
When the workday ended, she slipped the computer into her bag and walked straight out of the office.  
  
As expected, Logan was waiting at the elevator.  
  
""Layla, are you mad at me?"" His tone had changed completely from the afternoon's threats. A smile softened his face, his voice coaxing, almost sweet—the kind of act meant to charm naive girls.  
  
""I know I sounded harsh earlier. Did I scare you? I was only thinking of you. Emily has connections—why bother going against her? Just let this go, okay?""  
  
""Sure,"" Layla cut him off without hesitation. ""Settle it with cash.""  
  
Logan blinked, stunned. ""What do you mean?""  
  
""One price—two hundred and fifty thousand. You give me the money, and I won't tell the boss you're sleeping with his daughter while stealing designs for her. Those designs are mine. And I've got plenty of proof.""  
  
She paused, then added coolly, ""Also, since you stole from me, I should be filing a police report. Think it over.""  
  
Logan's jaw dropped. For a long moment, no words came out. He simply stared at her, dumbfounded.  
  
""How do you even know about our...""  
  
""Are you paying or not?"" Layla snapped, impatience seeping through her voice. ""The boss is upstairs in the conference room with a client, isn't he? I wouldn't mind giving him a little surprise right now.""  
  
Logan's face darkened. ""You're insane. Over one lousy design, you'd go this far?""  
  
He stepped closer, threatening, trying to intimidate her. Layla shifted aside, then drove the tip of her shoe hard into the back of his knee.  
  
""Ah—Layla."" Logan buckled with a cry, collapsing onto one knee in agony. His teeth clenched as he glared up at her. ""What the hell is wrong with you? Are you crazy?""  
  
""Two hundred and fifty thousand,"" Layla repeated, her voice icy.  
  
Logan forced himself to swallow his fury, his mind spinning.  
  
Why had she suddenly changed? The girl he knew had been meek, soft-spoken, easily flustered in front of people. Now she seemed unhinged.  
  
He weighed his options. Emily was the boss' illegitimate daughter. Money meant nothing to her—she spent freely, handed him cars worth hundreds of thousands just to drive around. If he stayed on her good side, his future would be secured.  
  
He couldn't let this bitch ruin everything.  
  
Grinding his teeth, he muttered, ""I don't have that much on me right now.""  
  
""That's your problem,"" Layla said, lifting her chin. ""The deal closes when the money's in my hand. Then I'll erase the evidence. You've got until tomorrow. After that, no deal.""  
  
She watched his expression twist with rage as he hobbled off, then turned away without another glance.  
  
Stepping out of the building, she drew a deep breath of the evening air. Her pace slowed as she looked around at the city—the towers soaring overhead, the crowds moving between glowing storefronts, the blare of horns and engines echoing through the streets.  
  
Ten years had passed since she'd last seen all this, yet her body remembered the way home. She followed her memory to the bus stop, rode the familiar route, and walked through the winding alleys.  
  
The elevator climbed floor by floor. Her heartbeat grew faster, heavier, thudding against her ribs.  
  
When the doors slid open, her knees nearly buckled. Hands trembling, she fumbled in her bag until she found her keys. Standing in front of the door she remembered so well, she tried again and again, but the key wouldn't slide in.  
  
""Calm down. Yes, chill down,"" she whispered to herself, tracing the lock with her fingertip until finally—click. The key turned.  
  
The door swung open.  
  
""Woof. Woof. Woof."" A sharp, joyful bark rang in her ears. A black-and-white husky bounded straight toward her, tail wagging furiously, circling her feet.  
  
It was her dog.  
  
It was the husky she had raised since it was just a clumsy little pup. Its eyes were a striking sapphire blue, its fur soft and clean. But not long after the apocalypse began, it went missing.  
  
When Layla finally told Logan to get the hell out and tore all pretense apart with him, he spat out the truth.  
  
""That mutt kept barking at me. I'd had enough.  
  
""Bad temper, yeah, but the meat was tasty.  
  
""Though it was a bit scrawny. You used to feed it really well—back when it was fat.""  
  
He was saying all that crap. What a bastard.  
  
Layla crouched down, wrapping her arms around the husky's head, sobbing so hard that she could barely breathe. The dog, clueless about why its master's mood had plummeted, just stood stiffly, letting Layla bury her face into its fur.  
  
""Hey, you're home early today.""  
  
Layla lifted her head. A middle-aged woman, dressed in a short-sleeved shirt and apron, stepped out of the kitchen, her face lighting up. ""Layla, perfect timing. Come taste the soup for me.""  
  
""Mom?"" Layla couldn't hold it back anymore. Tears spilled down her face.  
  
Layla was a pampered little princess, never having done any chores. In the apocalypse, her mother shielded her. When danger came, it was her mother who picked up the kitchen knife and swung it fiercely, driving intruders away.  
  
And in the end, it was her mother who blocked a whole mob with her own body, shouting at the top of her lungs, ""Layla, run.""  
  
So Layla ran. She ran for ten years.  
  
Layla scavenged trash, chewed on rotting food, drank filthy water, and fought mutated beasts until her body was covered in scars and wounds. She lived like a beast. Every time she thought she was about to die, she remembered her mother's voice. She knew her mother wanted her to survive.  
  
Aria Evans had no idea about any of this. Seeing her daughter in tears, she panicked, quickly closing the door and helping Layla up.  
  
""What's wrong? Didn't get picked for that competition? You're really worked up.""  
  
She assumed it was because Layla's design project, the one she had been pulling all-nighters for, hadn't gotten good results. Layla didn't explain. She wiped her tears away, slowly regaining her composure.  
  
""Don't be upset. I'll get you a bowl of bone broth to warm you up first,"" Aria said, hurrying back into the kitchen.  
  
The husky stayed close to Layla the whole time. Finally, it lay down on the couch, licking her fingers with worried eyes.  
  
Layla stroked its head gently. ""Don't worry. I'll protect you.""  
  
Then she looked toward the kitchen. She would protect her mother.  
  
This time, she would protect their home. 



**Chapter 3 The Necklace**



The broth Aria made with fresh marrow bones had simmered in the clay pot for over an hour. She tossed a few bay leaves into the soup, and the fragrance filled the room. The very first bowl was set in front of Layla.  
  
She took a sip. Carrots, onion, and celery had been added, the sweetness spreading across her tongue, blending with the rich, milky-white broth. The flavor was so good it almost made her doubt reality.  
  
In the apocalypse, clean food had been a luxury Layla could hardly ever taste.  
  
She had gone hungry day after day, gnawing even on rats as long as they were alive. She had convinced herself long ago that her sense of taste was gone forever.  
  
""Mom, what did you put in this? It tastes amazing.""  
  
""Nothing much. Just some garlic and salt. Fresh bones like this don't need heavy seasoning.""  
  
""Mom, can Heliy have some, too?"" Heliy was the husky's name. Layla had once come up with a list of elegant names, but none of them fit its goofy, straightforward vibe. So she settled on something simple, almost silly.  
  
""I set some aside without seasoning.""  
  
Aria fetched a small bowl with little bone patterns on the bottom and ladled out plain broth for Heliy.  
  
Upon watching her mother move about, Layla's resolve to live well grew stronger.  
  
When they finished eating, Layla jumped up to wash the dishes, leaving Aria a little bewildered.  
  
Their family wasn't well-off. It had always just been the two of them. Layla's father had passed away early, so Aria, worried her daughter would grow up deprived of love, spoiled her relentlessly. She feared Layla would be bullied, feared she would feel less cared for than other children.  
  
People often said poor kids matured early. But Layla had grown up like a little princess. The most she ever did was help keep an eye on her mom's stall when she was small.  
  
Otherwise, she never touched housework. As long as she claimed it was for studying, Aria indulged her in everything. Dolls and toys because other kids had them, interest classes she didn't understand but wanted to try—her mom made sure she had it all.  
  
But Layla hadn't fully appreciated any of it. In her past life, she had stayed up countless nights, overwhelmed by design deadlines. Aria would see the dark circles under her eyes and fuss. ""Sweetheart, your health comes first. That project can wait.""  
  
""You don't understand, so stop nagging me. The deadline's too close—where am I supposed to find extra time?""  
  
That had been her, always brushing off her mother's love.  
  
Layla turned off the faucet, silently promising herself.  
  
It was fine. From now on, things would be different.  
  
After dinner, she finally stepped back into her room, a place she hadn't seen in so long. There was no time for nostalgia. She opened her laptop and pulled up a file—her survival plan for the apocalypse.  
  
She would need supplies. Lots of them. She would need warehouses to store them. And, most importantly, a safe, long-term shelter.  
  
What she needed most right now was money.  
  
Layla's family only had a few tens of thousands in their account. Their most valuable asset was the two-bedroom apartment in a school district. Day-to-day expenses came solely from her paycheck.  
  
It was far too little.  
  
Almost unconsciously, Layla touched her neck. She wore a necklace—Aria's wedding gift, passed down for generations. It was made of ruby and emerald, but the design struck Layla as gaudy.  
  
She'd never cared for it. But one day, Aria had dug it out, eyes lighting up as she insisted Layla try it on, showering her with praise about how beautiful it looked.  
  
Layla had planned to humor her mom, wear it for a few days, and then tuck it away. But she'd gotten used to it and forgot to take it off. Strangely enough, even during those desperate early days of the apocalypse, she'd never thought to pawn it for food or supplies.  
  
Now, in this moment, her fingers found nothing.  
  
The necklace was gone.  
  
That couldn't be right. Her memory was sharp—she should be wearing it now. Panic rising, she grabbed a mirror, but all she saw near her collarbone was a strange scar. The necklace had vanished without a trace.  
  
As she ran her fingers over the spot again, dizziness hit her. A vision flashed before her eyes, like another world superimposed on her own.  
  
A small, misty plot of land. In the center stood a shabby wooden hut. Its roof sagged, its walls were stained dark and filthy, and half the front door had rotted away. A fence beside it, made of decayed wood, leaned crookedly. Beyond it lay barren, withered fields.  
  
Everything was stiff and lifeless, as if time itself had withered.  
  
Layla shook her head. The dizziness vanished, and she was back in her own room. What was that? A hallucination?  
  
She focused, recalling the sensation from before.  
  
Slowly, the vision reappeared. Layla felt as if she were holding a camera, viewing the desolate little space from a first-person perspective.  
  
She edged closer, slipping past the ruined door. The roof had gaping holes, the walls were stripped bare, and the whole place was empty—except for a single vanity table by the window.  
  
Drawn to it, she moved nearer. And there, displayed neatly on top, was her missing necklace.  
  
She reached out, trying to grab it, but her hand passed through like it wasn't really there, as if it belonged only to this place.  
  
The necklace, once tacky in her eyes, now gleamed with solemn grandeur. The ruby shimmered brightly, while the emerald pendant beneath pulsed with a deep, unfathomable glow.          ",1,1760111320.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

This bundle includes a PP filter, CTO filter, PCF filter, and the RO membrane, designed to deliver fresh, clean, and great-tasting water. As someone who values quality water filtration but also dreads complicated setups, this product promised a lot—and I was eager to test it out.

**Exceptional Design and Build Quality**  
I was immediately impressed by the thoughtful design and sturdy components of this replacement filter kit. The polypropylene (PP) filter feels durable, while the activated carbon (CTO) and post-carbon filters (PCF) are compact and ready for action. The crowning piece is the advanced reverse osmosis (RO) membrane, which doesn’t just work—it thrives. The design ensures compatibility with the RO100ROPOT system, and everything fits snugly, making the entire setup feel professionally crafted. It’s not often that I find myself admiring the look of water filters, but here we are.

**Ease of Installation**  
Replacing these filters? I kid you not—it’s about as easy as making a cup of instant coffee. No tools were required, and the process was a breeze. I especially appreciated not needing to shut off the water supply, which felt like a lifesaver during my busy mornings. Even for someone like me who doesn’t consider themselves particularly handy, the straightforward instructions made the whole task practically foolproof.

**Hassle-Free Maintenance**  
With filters lasting an impressive amount of time—one year for the PP, CTO, and PCF types and two years for the RO membrane—there’s very little to worry about. Unlike some other systems I’ve tried, which practically remind you weekly that replacements are due, this pack feels like it was designed for people who value their time. After installation, resetting the filter lifespan was equally simple, thanks to the clear instructions that came with the product. I did have a question about settings once, and reaching customer service was refreshingly easy. They were helpful, quick, and actually solved my issue. Shocking, I know!

**Benefits of Everyday Use**  
- Filters efficiently remove a noticeable range of contaminants, offering water that tastes reliably crisp.  
- Extended filter lifespan minimizes replacements and saves money.  
- User-friendly installation with zero tools required is perfect for those not inclined toward DIY projects.  
- Compact design integrates seamlessly with the countertop system without eating up extra space.  

**Shortcomings to Note**  
- Lifespan monitoring relies on manual reset functions; forgetting to reset could lead to confusion.  
- While the installation is easy, the initial instructions could be slightly clearer for complete beginners.  
- The kit is exclusive to the RO100ROPOT system, so it’s not as versatile for users with other filtration setups.  

**Competing Brands**  
Compared to competitor brands like Brita or Aquasana, the standout features of this product include the layered filtration process and long-lasting RO membrane. Brita, for instance, is more about quick fixes with basic filters and doesn’t offer the same thorough contaminant removal. Aquasana, while a premium brand, often comes with a steep learning curve during installations and pricier replacements overall. What sets Bluevua apart is the balance between advanced technology and practicality. However, I will say that Aquasana systems might be a better fit for larger households or those looking for whole-house filtration. The RO100ROPOT kit is strictly personal-sized, tailor-made for countertop convenience.

**Bang for the Buck**  
While the exact pricing can fluctuate, the multi-year lifespan of these filters effectively justifies the investment. What struck me most is the relative affordability combined with the high efficiency. I’ve bought cheaper replacements from other brands in the past, but they wore out within months, requiring constant upkeep. This set really impressed me by offering longevity without cutting corners in quality. However, if you’re expecting to use filters for more general purposes outside of their intended design, it’s worth reassessing if it provides the versatility you need.

Background: my MIL and FIL have always been difficult and cold toward me, but I tolerated it because my husband is close with them. Three years after we married, I met my MIL for coffee to try and repair the relationship (she had just sent some unhinged messages attacking me for “not making enough effort”). Instead of apologising she said “sorry if my message hurt you” and basically doubled down on me not being a good daughter in law. I’ve always tried really hard with her and my FIL. I didn’t accept that I had never made effort and pointed to all the times I had tried with her and actually pointed out all the times she had been really rude towards me. That didn’t go down well and it escalated. MIL told me my wedding day was “the worst day of her life,” insisted my husband never wanted to marry me, criticized my parents, and demanded back a necklace she’d given me when I got engaged. I dropped the necklace round a couple of days later and that was the last time we spoke.

Since we got married my husband has had on/off contact with them (off only when they were behaving rudely to me), but a few weeks ago he decided he’d had enough of how they treated me and cut off contact temporarily. We’re in the middle of IVF and he wants to focus on me and our future family, and to remove sources of stress (i.e. his parents) for now. He’s supportive of cutting contact for the time being, but he’s made it clear that in the future he wants his children to have some relationship with his parents and he doesn’t want them out of his life forever.

I got a birthday message from my MIL a few days ago. I haven’t replied. Part of me wants to send a very firm message listing everything she’s done and telling her our relationship is irreparably damaged - partly for my own satisfaction (not because she will apologise)  - but I’m afraid it will make things worse / not achieve anything other than being cathartic. 

So: ignore the birthday message, respond with a firm boundary, or wait until our situation is more settled? ",16,1760111228.0,JUSTNOMIL,16,0.9,False

⸻

☕️ **Coffee I tried:**

* Iced Americano - 170₹ - 10/10 - The pricing was great. The coffee was great. Nothing to add here. Would recommend wholeheartedly.
* Basil Cold Brew - 220₹ - 8/10 - The pricing is not high enough to be an issue. The beverage was great in the beginning but turned quite sour after the ice had melted towards the end of the drink. The taste of coffee was also a little weak for my taste but that is very subjective. 
* Aeropress - 250₹ - 7/10 - The taste was great but the pricing was a tad bit high. Won't recommend. 
* Sparkling Cold Brew - 210₹ - 7/10 - The taste was okay. The pricing was okay. Nothing special here. 

⸻

Here’s my take:   
With 7+1 branches, Piccolo ( By The BRewed Leaf) is the biggest cafe chain in Nagpur (if you don't count brim and Corridor 7 as one entity). So the expectations were quite high with them.  I would say this is some Haldirams vs Ajit Bakery kinda rivalry between TBL and C7, but instead of sweets and snacks it's just beans and brews. 

""I am a coffee fanatic, Once you go to proper coffee, you can't go back. You just cannot go back"" - Hugh Laurie (Dr. House)

We asked them for the exact beans that they use, and we were told its a special medium roast that they source directly. General decor of the place was very uniform and felt rigid in a good way, with the dark green eco type of color theme. The place was well lit, with a stream of young crowd always keeping the place look busy, they also had quite a good range of food and dessert options. 

Overall, Piccolo is good enough. The service was very quick, fastest for all the cafes we have visited thus far. Would recommend  for a parties of size 1-6, especially if you enjoy your Iced Americano. Specialty coffee brews like V60, Aeropress etc were too expensive for what the other places in market offer. All the Piccolo branches have a smoking zone, if that’s something that you look for.

What do you  guys generally opt for? Haldirams or Ajit Bakery? C7 or Piccolo?

i started a job as a paralegal at the firm i have a training contract for and start as a trainee next september. i was offered the position back in January of this year whilst doing the SQE and was told the firm is really busy and could do with an extra pair of hands to support the team i am now in. however, having been here for four weeks now, i have been so so quiet to the point of the days being painful. 

i have raised my concerns that im not busy enough to my supervisor and HR during a welcome meeting and was told to ask around to see if anyone needs anything doing. i do this on a daily basis and am consistently met with“ill think of something” or very small ad hoc tasks that take me a few minutes to complete. 

i have also tried arranging coffee chats with a partner to learn more about their practice and hopefully get some more work but he has been too busy to meet with me in the past two weeks and keeps asking to reschedule. 

i started at the same time as the current trainee cohort who have been a lot busier by comparison but are in completely different departments so there is so no way i can assist in supporting their workload. my main concern is that because i am doing so little now, i am not being exposed to a lot of tasks so i can train and improve. therefore i haven’t had the opportunity to learn that many things and i am concerned this would reflect badly in my performance review.  luckily as a paralegal i don’t have billable targets but i am “supposed” to be recording 7 hours of time a day but i have only ever hit that about three times. 

i have been very vocal about the fact i have capacity to the fee earners and my supervisor but have been told “it’ll pick up” or that i’ll regret asking for work when it gets too busy. im just wondering what the hell to do! i feel like i have exhausted my options but if anyone has any advice or has been in a similar situation im open to hearing it 

EDIT: i have regularly been reading the firms trainee resources and practical law/lexis, making my own notes in my spare time but can only do this for so many hours a day without going insane ",3,1760111104.0,uklaw,5,1.0,False

1o34fkg,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewMomStuff/comments/1o34fkg/some_tips_as_a_ftm/,Some tips as a FTM,"Hey mamas — just wanted to share a few things I learned after giving birth. Everyone’s experience is different, but if any of these happen to you, know that it’s normal and that it will get better. 💗

1. Swelling in your legs and feet:
Totally normal after labor, especially if you had an epidural or lots of IV fluids. It can last 3–5 days. Try to take it easy, elevate your feet, and cut back on salt — your body is just flushing everything out.


2. Engorgement (when your milk comes in):
When your colostrum turns into milk, your breasts might suddenly feel huge and painful. It’s called engorgement, and it usually only lasts a couple of days. Warm compresses or a shower can help, and it does get better fast.


3. Feeling “fine” too soon:
Around week 1–2, you might feel great and ready to get up and move — but your pelvic floor is still healing. Avoid long walks or lifting anything heavy. That pelvic pressure feeling is normal from pushing; rest as much as possible. By around week 6, it’ll ease up a lot.


4. Baby’s weight loss:
Newborns always lose a bit of weight the first week, even if your milk supply is good. As long as baby is sucking and having wet diapers, you’re doing fine. Skip the pump if you can — nursing directly helps your supply. Most babies regain their birth weight by week 2.


5. Jaundice:
Some babies get a little yellow from breastfeeding-related jaundice. It usually peaks and resolves by week 3. Your pediatrician will keep an eye on it.


6. Gas and grunting around week 3:
Super common! Their little digestive systems are still adjusting. Stick to easy-to-digest foods if you’re breastfeeding, and it should improve by around week 7. If your baby seems really uncomfortable and is grunting so much that it’s hard to watch, you can try gas drops like Mylicon on those especially rough days — it can help take the edge off. Many moms also notice that reducing dairy in their own diet helps ease baby’s gas and fussiness a bit.

7. Reflux and spit-up:
Some babies have reflux or big spit-ups, especially if your letdown is strong. Try burping more often and pause feeding if your flow feels fast. Spit-ups usually peak around week 6 and improve a lot by week 12.

8. Hemorrhoids (ugh, yes):
Some people get them in the third trimester or after labor because of the extra pressure from the uterus or constipation. They’re super common, but hard to fully get rid of naturally. Sitz baths, witch hazel pads, and hydrocortisone creams can really help make things more comfortable. Keep your stools soft — fiber, plenty of water, or Miralax can be your best friends. If it turns into a skin tag, it’s okay to just leave it be until you’re done having babies.

9. Mental health during the newborn phase:
The constant feeding and sleep deprivation can be really hard, even though you love your baby. You’re feeding 8–12 times a day, and sometimes each session can last close to an hour — it’s exhausting and repetitive. Once you get past the early weeks of figuring out latch and positioning, try to make it easier on yourself: listen to podcasts, watch a show, or do something that helps you zone out a bit while feeding.
When you’re cleared by your OB, start light workouts and work toward a gentle routine — for both you and baby. Try to fit in small things that make you feel like you again — reading, a short walk, a quiet coffee outing, anything that fills your cup.

---

You’re doing great — postpartum recovery is no joke, and the early weeks can be rough. It does get easier. Take care of yourself and rest whenever you can 💕

1o34d9i,https://www.reddit.com/r/tron/comments/1o34d9i/many_reviewers_critical_of_the_movie_really_didnt/,Many reviewers critical of the movie really didn't understand the point of Ares,"Spoilers ahead. Read only if you've seen the movie. You've been warned!


I do not mean to belittle any reviewer who has negative opinions of this film but from what I've read, I think they just genuinely don't understand the movie. That isn't to say that the film was too intellectual in any way but rather they didn't understand the purpose of the film nor how it connects back to the first two Tron films. 


The plot of this movie more or less is what Joseph Kosinski was planning on making, just with Eve Kim replacing Sam and Quorra, and Julian Dillinger replacing Ed Dillinger Jr. The original plot more or less remains unchanged, so don't lament the film we could have gotten less than a decade ago. It would have starred Jared Leto all the same. 


I recall reading that it ""wasn't a proper sequel to Legacy"", with some reviewers not even noticing all the not so subtle hints to the previous title. While it doesn't take place immediately after or focus on Sam and Quorra, it certainly does acknowledge the world and how it changed after the events of Legacy. Sam is mentioned as the previous CEO, his influence of making Encom a friendlier, more social company is shown in their focus on videogames and Sam having decorated the office with Kevin's memorabilia. Little details like the security guard with his feet on the security desk while holding a coffee mug and dropping it once the servers get hacked was a nice call back. The look of identity disks for users and non-MCP programs was very much in the style of Legacy. Kevin Flynn's home in his personal Grid has the piano from Legacy with a similar floor plan, to say nothing of the Dude himself in his white robes from Legacy. And of course, the ending features Ares on a quest to find Sam and Quorra, riding off on Kevin's Ducati. 


Side note 1, my personal headcanon is that Kevin derived the permanence code from the ISOs. Isomorphic algorithms were going to change the world by being the key that bridged the digital world and the real one. The permanence code is visually DNA, the very same thing ISOs possessed that standard programs didn't. Perhaps the ISOs originally came into being because the system assimilated Flynn's human DNA with the programs running and created an ideal hybrid of both. Either way, I believe that the concepts of the ISOs changing the world was partially implemented in Tron: Ares through the permanence code since it allows Encom to literally change the world with 3D printing solutions to the world's problems. God willing this movie does well enough to justify a sequel, perhaps this headcanon becomes codified and we can learn more about Sam and Quorra's exploits. 


Side note 2, Flynn as a ghost in the machine with the permanence code makes him a figurative and literal Deus Ex Machina. Just thought that was funny. 


Obviously the influence of the first Tron cannot be understated either. Kevin Flynn's personal Grid has become a hybrid of the old Encom grid and the one from Legacy, featuring the retro artstyle, retro light cycle, Bit, the hole in the wall from the light cycle battle and film grain overlay. The choice to make the first permanence test seen in the movie an orange tree is a direct reference to the Encom engineers test with an orange in the first film. 


This is all to say that reviewers who decried the film for being flat or one dimensional didn't get it. Yes, character development and story weren't the most complex or center stage, but that was never the case in Tron or Legacy. The world of Tron, both the real one and the Grids, is and should be viewed as the primary draw and in a way, the central character of the films. The multiple iterations of the Grids grow and change. The real world is affected by elements of those Grids escaping and changing the status quo. 


I think Tron: Ares lives up to its potential by carrying the themes and cool ideas introduced in Tron: Legacy and making good on the idea of Flynn ""changing the world through a digital frontier to reshape the human condition"". Unfortunately, only real Tron fans would have picked up on that and real Tron fans many reviewers are not. It's a shame that their negative opinions due to lack of source material knowledge and rigid expectations about what character and story NEED to be may hamper the box office take, similar to what happened to Legacy. Ironically, for those reviewers upset that the story wasn't about Sam and Quorra, all the negativity may result in us never finding out what they were up to since we may not get another sequel if negative reviews dissuade people from seeing the film.

I used to take her on play dates with a friend where we’d get coffee and head to the park, is that considered done?
I’ve asked these questions to her oncologist and she basically told us to keep her out of indoor spaces unless we need to then mask up, to keep her away from anyone sick or possibly sick (obviously), but that little play dates outside at the park are okay.

I’m **Justin Lewis with Five Star Real Estate**, and I’m excited to share that I’ve officially opened a **real estate office in downtown Lake City**! You’ll find us **inside the same building as LC Tax & Accounting at 102 S. Main Street** — right in the heart of town.

This has been a dream of mine since moving back to Northern Michigan creating a local space where people can stop in, ask questions, or just chat about the market, the lakes, or life around here. Whether you’re thinking about **buying, selling, or investing**, I’m always happy to help and share what’s going on in the community.

If you’re walking downtown, **stop by and say hi!** You’ll probably catch me talking real estate, coaching baseball, or planning my next coffee run ☕️.

Hoping to find some people who are looking to make long term friends, with the view to starting on or moving over to Discord (same username), that are hopefully are at least on their way to being as nerdy as I am, have some stuff in common we can talk about and are happy chatting about anything and everything, from what they had to eat for dinner all the way through to your top five things to do if you were the first person to discover time travel.

I have a habit of not knowing when to stop typing if you give me a keyboard, so I'm going to summarise in a sort of user profile thing. Hopefully it will make it a bit more readable and with any luck keep the word count down. I make no promises.

**Preferred Name:** Strix (pronounced like 'sticks')  
**Age:** 39  
**Gender:** Male (he/him)  
**Location:** East Midlands, England, UK (GMT/BST time zone)  
**Personality:** Sarcastic, loyal, friendly, empathetic, open-minded, idealistic, unserious, imaginative, logical, introverted, opinionated, unfocused, emotional, introspective.  
**Hobbies:** Video games (on PC, play a lot of Fortnite ZB, pretty sure my Steam profile is public, same username again), TTRPGs, board games, music, anything fantasy or sci-fi, reading fiction, anime, alternative music (my taste is actually pretty eclectic, this is more of a lean) and walking  
**Likes:** Decaf coffee, storms and 'bad' weather, dogs, baked beans on toast, starting hobbies, greenery, giving advice, an aimless drive around, discussion  
**Dislikes:** Working, sleeping, bigots, sports, practicing hobbies, hot weather, crowds, feeling unhelpful, impatience  
**Other info:** I've lived in the Midlands my whole life. I work in IT and have done for several years, work is a means to an end for me and careers don't feel all that 'important' but I do enjoy the IT side of things. I'm happily married and we've been together for 14 years this year, both of us forgot it's our wedding anniversary this weekend... No kids and no interest. Would like a pet, but want to move in a year or 2 first. I have ADHD and Social Anxiety, this is either just info or a warning, I'll let you decide.

So if all that sounds acceptable, just a few additional points of order:

* I can't constantly reply as I have life, work and other commitments
* Conversely I also won't indefinitely carry the conversation either
* We're both looking for friends, sure, but everyone is different and we may not get on, that should be accepted beforehand
* Voice chat isn't a short term aim. I don't like that my anxiety is like this and want to VC in the long run, but it's a work in progress
* Chill vibes only. Closed-minded, judgemental, toxic or volatile people need not apply
* Adults only; beyond that, anyone is welcome!

If you haven't already closed this tab, thanks for getting to the bottom and hope to hear from you!

Welcome, fellow adventurers! The call to explore new horizons is a powerful one, but it doesn't have to come with a hefty price tag. Forget the notion that travel is a luxury reserved for the few. With a little planning and an open mind, you can experience the rich tapestry of our world without emptying your wallet. This guide is your passport to smart, affordable, and unforgettable journeys.

# The Smart Way to Get Around: Private Transport & Rentals

While flights and accommodation are often booked in advance, on-the-ground transportation can be a puzzle. How do you explore at your own pace without costs spiraling? Renting a private vehicle—be it a car, a scooter, or a taxi for the day—can be a surprisingly pragmatic and cost-effective solution. Here’s how to make it work for you.

# Before You Go: The Essential Checklist

* [**International Driving Permit**](https://www.e-itca.org/) **(IDP):** Don't leave home without it. While your home country's license is the primary document, an IDP is its official translation, recognized globally. Many rental agencies and all traffic police will require it. It smooths out the process and prevents any language-barrier headaches.
* **Know the Rules of the Road:** This is non-negotiable. Driving etiquette, road signs, speed limits, and right-of-way rules can vary dramatically. A quick online search for the ""driving rules of \[Country\]"" will save you from potential fines, accidents, and stress. Remember, in some countries, a honk is a friendly ""I'm here!"" while in others, it's an insult.
* **Check Your Insurance:** Your travel insurance or credit card might offer some rental coverage, but always double-check the fine print. It's often wise to take out the local, comprehensive insurance offered by the rental company for complete peace of mind.

# Why Renting Saves You Money and Time

* **Group Travel Economics:** For groups of two or more, the math is simple. Splitting the cost of a single rental car for a day is almost always cheaper than buying four separate bus tickets or taking multiple individual taxis.
* **Transparent, Fixed Pricing:** When you rent a vehicle or hire a driver for the day, you agree on a price upfront. This eliminates the anxiety of a running meter in city traffic or the need to haggle after every ride, preventing unexpected surcharges.
* **Unlock Remote Areas:** The most magical places are often off the beaten path, far from train stations or bus routes. A rental gives you the freedom to discover that secluded beach, remote monastery, or breathtaking viewpoint that public transport just can't reach.
* **Ultimate Itinerary Freedom:** See a beautiful spot and want to stay longer? Want to start your day at sunrise to get the perfect photo? With your own transport, you are the master of your schedule, free from the constraints of bus or train timetables.
* **Safety and Reliability:** Renting from a reputable agency ensures you have a well-maintained vehicle and a point of contact in case of any issues. It helps you avoid common tourist scams associated with rogue taxi drivers.



# The Destinations: Four Corners of Affordable Adventure

Now for the exciting part! Let's journey to some of the world's most enchanting and economical destinations.



# Vietnam: A Symphony of Sights, Sounds, and Flavors

Vietnam is a country that assaults the senses in the best way possible. From the chaotic ballet of scooters in Hanoi to the serene beauty of rice paddies, this is a destination that offers incredible value.

* **Best Time to Travel:** The sweet spot is **November to April**. This period brings cooler, drier weather across most of the country, making it ideal for everything from city exploration to trekking.
* **Visa Requirements:** Many nationalities can now get an e-Visa online before they travel, which is a simple and efficient process. Always check your country's specific requirements well in advance.

# Must-See Places

* **Hanoi:** Dive headfirst into the Old Quarter, a maze of streets where vendors sell everything imaginable. Visit the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum for a dose of history, and don't miss a traditional water puppet show. **Pro-Tip:** Start your day with a cup of rich, creamy *cà phê trứng* (egg coffee) at a local café overlooking Hoan Kiem Lake.
* **Ha Long Bay:** These iconic limestone karsts rising from emerald waters are a UNESCO World Heritage site for a reason. Opt for an overnight cruise—even a budget-friendly one—to experience the bay's magic at sunset and sunrise, away from the day-trip crowds.
* **Hoi An:** Step back in time in this enchanting, lantern-lit port town. The ancient town is a pedestrian-only zone in the evenings, making it perfect for a leisurely stroll. **Insider Tip:** Hoi An is famous for its tailors. You can get high-quality, custom-made clothing (from suits to dresses) for a fraction of what you'd pay at home.



# Mexico: A Kaleidoscope of Culture and Coastlines

Look beyond the all-inclusive resorts and you'll find a Mexico brimming with profound history, vibrant art, and landscapes that range from desert canyons to jungle-swathed ruins.

* **Best Time to Travel:** For inland cities like Mexico City, the drier, cooler months of **November to April** are most comfortable. The coasts are beautiful year-round, but be mindful of the hurricane season (roughly June to October).
* **Visa Requirements:** Citizens of many countries (including the US, Canada, UK, and EU nations) can enter visa-free for up to 180 days. Just ensure your passport has at least six months of validity.

# Must-See Places

* **Mexico City (CDMX):** A world-class capital. Explore the Zócalo (main square), be awestruck by the ancient artifacts at the National Museum of Anthropology, and visit the vibrant blue house of the Frida Kahlo Museum.
* **Oaxaca:** This is Mexico's culinary and cultural heart. Wander its colorful colonial streets, explore the sprawling Monte Albán ruins, and take a day trip to witness the mezcal-making process (with tastings, of course!).
* **Tulum:** Experience a perfect blend of history and paradise. Explore the stunning Mayan ruins perched on a cliff overlooking the turquoise Caribbean Sea. Afterwards, cool off by swimming in a *cenote*, a natural freshwater sinkhole considered sacred by the Mayans.

# Street Food Fiesta

Forget fancy restaurants; the real magic is on the street. Devour *tacos al pastor* shaved directly from the spit, snack on *elotes* (grilled corn slathered in cheese, chili, and lime), and indulge in fresh *tamales*. It's delicious, authentic, and incredibly cheap.



# Bulgaria: Europe’s Hidden Historical Gem

Nestled in the Balkans, Bulgaria is a land of ancient monasteries, rugged mountains, and a hearty welcome. It offers the richness of European history and nature at a price that feels like a delightful secret.

* **Best Time to Travel:** **May to September** offers pleasant, warm weather perfect for hiking, exploring cities, and enjoying the Black Sea coast.
* **Visa Requirements:** As part of the EU, Bulgaria allows visa-free access for other EU citizens. Many other nationalities can also enter visa-free for short stays, but always confirm the latest rules for your passport.

# Must-See Places

* **Sofia:** The capital is a vibrant city with layers of history. Marvel at the gold-domed Alexander Nevsky Cathedral and discover Roman ruins sitting casually beneath the modern city. **Pro-Tip:** Take a free walking tour to get your bearings and learn fascinating stories about the city's past.
* **Plovdiv:** Arguably one of Europe's most beautiful and oldest cities. Get lost in the cobbled streets of the Old Town, catch a performance at the incredibly well-preserved Roman Amphitheater, and soak up the creative vibe in the Kapana arts district.
* **Rila Monastery:** Tucked away in the pristine Rila Mountains, this monastery is the spiritual heart of Bulgaria. Its stunning frescoes, checkered archways, and serene location make it an unmissable and soul-stirring day trip.

# Balkan BitesBulgarian food is hearty and delicious. Start with a fresh Shopska Salad (cucumbers, tomatoes, and sirene cheese). Try Banitsa, a flaky pastry filled with cheese, and for a main, enjoy Kavarma, a slow-cooked meat and vegetable stew.

# Romania: Where Fairytales and Forests Meet

Journey into a land of medieval castles, whispering forests, and charming Saxon villages. Romania is a budget traveler's delight, offering a rich history that feels straight out of a storybook.

* **Best Time to Travel:** Visit from **May to September** when the weather is warm, the landscapes are lush and green, and the mountain roads (like the famous Transfăgărășan) are open.
* **Visa Requirements:** Romania follows similar visa policies to Bulgaria. EU citizens have free access, and many others can enter visa-free for tourism. Check the specific rules for your nationality.

# Must-See Places

* **Bucharest:** Romania's dynamic capital offers a fascinating contrast of elegant Belle Époque buildings, a charming old town, and the colossal, imposing Palace of Parliament from its communist era.
* **Brasov:** Set in the heart of Transylvania, this is the perfect base for exploring. Wander the beautiful Council Square, hike or take the cable car up Tampa Mountain for panoramic views, and use it as a launchpad for a trip to Bran Castle (famously linked to the Dracula legend).
* **Sighișoara:** This is a true fairytale town. A UNESCO World Heritage site, it's one of the last inhabited medieval citadels in Europe. Climb the clock tower, walk the cobbled streets, and visit the birthplace of Vlad the Impaler, the real-life inspiration for Dracula.

# Dracula's Delicacies

Romanian cuisine is pure comfort food. Don't leave without trying *Sarmale* (cabbage rolls stuffed with meat and rice) served with *Mămăligă* (a creamy cornmeal porridge similar to polenta) and a dollop of sour cream.

Your dream adventure doesn't need a millionaire's budget—it just needs your curiosity. These destinations prove that a rich travel experience is measured in memories made, not money spent. So pack your bags, choose your path, and let the world unfold before you. Happy travels!

Picture this: you’re at a coffee shop, your friend wants to send you Bitcoin for that double espresso, and instead of fumbling with a 34-character address (which may or may not have a typo), you just *flash* a QR code and—boom—transaction done. That magical moment? That’s the kind of magic we bring with our free Bitcoin QR code API.

Our service is all about ease, speed, and reliability. Developers — you’re in the spotlight: with a few lines of code, you can embed a live, scan-ready QR in your app, site, or widget. No fuss, no plug-ins, no ugly hacks. Once you point your front-end to the API, the heavy lifting is on us. Want to see it in action? Check out the full docs and let your imagination run wild at [https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com/bitcoin-qr-code-maker-api-and-widgets/](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com/bitcoin-qr-code-maker-api-and-widgets/).

# 🚀 Why This API Rocks

**1. Simplicity meets power**  
You’ve got a Bitcoin address? Great. Just plug it into our API endpoint, and you get back a QR image ready to scan. It’s that easy. No need to mess with low-level QR encoding libraries or image generators—just a clean HTTP call and done. Our generator also adheres to best practices for crypto URI schemes, combining address, amount, and optional memo/labels into one coherent payload. ([Bitcoin QR Code Maker](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

**2. Always free (yes, really free)**  
Many QR APIs start free and then hide behind paywalls or request limits once you grow. Not here. We believe in giving developers a tool that scales with your creativity—not your bankroll. Use it in side projects, production apps, donation pages, or coffee shop POS systems.

**3. Stylish & flexible QR output**  
We know looks matter. So we let you tweak size, style, and branding (while keeping scan reliability high). The API supports crypto-style badges (Bitcoin logos, etc.) and auto-resizing so your design never gets in the way of readability. ([Bitcoin QR Code Maker](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

**4. Secure & reliable operation**  
Your privacy and trust matter. All API traffic is encrypted over HTTPS. We also validate address format server-side to reduce bad QR outputs. Since QR codes are often irreversible (you can’t “un-scan” a wrong address), we take extra care to guard your users from mistakes.

# How to Use It — (No Dev Sorcery Required)

Here's a minimal example (in plain HTML) to embed a QR:

    <img src=""https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com/api/?style=bitcoin&address=YOUR_BITCOIN_ADDRESS_HERE""
         alt=""Scan to pay in Bitcoin""
         width=""200"" height=""200"">

Swap in your address (and tweak `style` as needed), and voilà—you have a working Bitcoin payment QR. Behind the scenes, that URL calls the API which returns a fully formed QR image. ([Bitcoin QR Code Maker](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

You can also wrap that in widgets or front-end logic so your site dynamically generates a QR whenever someone wants to pay. Combined with server-side orders or bookkeeping, you can build a full crypto-checkout flow in minutes.

# Real Use Cases (Beyond Coffee)

* **Donations & tipping** — Artists, streamers, or nonprofits can embed a “Donate Bitcoin” QR in their site or merch.
* **E-commerce checkouts** — Let customers pay in BTC by scanning a generated QR at checkout.
* **Point-of-sale systems** — For in-person crypto payments, display the QR on a tablet or screen.
* **Peer-to-peer exchanges** — Swap meets, events, or local trades get simpler and safer with QR-ized address sharing.

# A Little Heads-Up (Because we care)

* Always verify that the QR embedding reflects the *correct* address & amount. QR encoding is powerful—but mistakes can be unforgiving.
* Some wallets and hardware devices expect the BIP-21 URI format (address + amount + label). Our API supports that pattern to maximize compatibility.
* QR codes, by design, are **one-way**. You generate them; users scan them. If you need tracking, dynamic updating, or analytics, that’s a separate layer your app can handle or extend.

So go ahead—stop making your users type out blockchain gobbledygook. Give them a seamless, visual way to pay. To get started, dive into our API and widgets at [**https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com/bitcoin-qr-code-maker-api-and-widgets/**](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com/bitcoin-qr-code-maker-api-and-widgets/) and build something people will actually enjoy using.

Last year, my cousin (22M) introduced his girlfriend to our family, the first ever to bring someone home. Since then, on every occasion, he brings her around. Medyo nainggit ako? 😆

He was the first to bring a partner into our family and I was so happy seeing them. 

But, made me think: “ama namin, nasa’n ang akin?” LOL

I’m well aware that this platform should be my last resort. But truth be told, I’ve had more meaningful conversations here than on Bumble. 

Hence, I’ll get straight to the point, I’m giving love one last chance. Sawa na ko magpaka girl boss, gusto ko na maging lover girl ulit hahahahahahaha. 

About me:

- **25 F.** Turning 26 this October. 
- **5’6 in height,** tall girl, I know!
- **I have a curvy build.** I’m a plus size, but I have always been active, and I try to be! Sabi din ng moveit rider ko kahapon, cute naman ako. ‘Di ka naman lugi!
- **Clean and hygienic.** Pati mga nakakatabi ko sa bus tinatanong ano pabango ko eh. 
- **I’m a freelance digital marketer**, also trying to build my own staffing agency (now in the works). I’ve always been independent, I pay my bills on time, provide for my parents, and I’m always hungry for work.
- But **I work from home and live solo in Makati**, so I can always make time for you. 
- **Outgoing and a sucker for traveling.** I highly believe that I am in my prime era so I’m making the most out of my time. 
- **I’m a yapper and also a listener.** ‘Di ako mauubusan ng kwento pero mahilig din ako makinig ng kwento. I’ll often ask how your day went — if that’s something you won’t mind.
- **I have 2 cats.** They’re my kids, and a top priority next to my parents. You don’t have to be a cat lover, but I’d love for you to understand how much they mean to me.
- **Even at my most evil, I love immensely.** Despite this dating generation, I know my heart. I give every ounce of love and respect once I start loving you, and I hope to receive the same energy. 
- **Single.** And you should be too.

About you:

- **Older than me.** I’ve dated younger men, and through experience, I’ve realized it just doesn’t work for me. Every time, it falls short of the kind of connection I’m looking for. I hope you understand that this is a boundary I’ve set with intention.
- **Taller than me.** Tall girl kasi ako, and while height isn’t everything, I find that most men also prefer to be taller than their partners. It's a preference rooted in comfort and compatibility.
- **When it comes to looks, I genuinely don’t have a checklist.** Over the years of dating, I realized that I’m drawn to people who are respectful lang talaga, like the kind who never forget to say *thank you* to the guards who open doors for us, that kind of kindness and presence speaks volumes.
- **Clean and hygienic.** This is a bare minimum, right? 
- **Working professional.** I’m someone who has always been driven in my career, and I’m looking for a partner who shares that mindset. Ideally, I’d love a DINK setup if things progress.
- **Sincere and do not play around.** ‘Di ko kailangan ng manchild. I’m not here for the drama, confusion, or half-hearted intentions. 
- **Loves traveling and outgoing too.** I’d love to explore new places, or even just discover a new coffee spot in the neighborhood on a quiet afternoon. 
- **Single.** No explanation needed.

1o33xtc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o33xtc,REVIEW: Westward Chardonnay Finish Lost Lantern,"Bottle number three on my awestward journey is another Single Cask from Lost Lantern. I was excited about this one when it was it was released because Chardonnay is not a common finishing cask for whisky. 

The nose is dry, a little bit sweet and a little bit nutty with aromatic wood in the background. The palate is decently oily, then some sweetness, leather, coffee, nuts and a pleasant creaminess. It finishes rather dry with lightly sweet fruit bordering on sour. 

To be honest, this is my least favorite bottle from Lost Lantern. That’s not to say it’s not good, rather so many other barrel picks they’ve done are just so very good that this settles to the lower end. It is interesting, just doesn’t have flavors that draw me back in. I also feel that the Chardonnay cask still allows a lot of the base malt to come through. 

Age: 4yr

Mashbill: 
100% Malted Barley

Casks: 
New Oak barrel (28 months)
Ex-Chardonnay cask (20 months)

ABV: 60.5%

Price: $100

Bottle from my collection. 

My Rating: 70💧

So I looked all over and I found a reddit post where someone explained how to get into test mode, got into test mode and tried all mechanisms all were working expect for the motor, just clicking sounds.

I took it to a shop and when I got it back he told me he couldn't figure what the problem was, now in test mode the crusher is the only thing that works, pump doesn't work and one motor movement only makes the same clicking sound.

Any help or guidance would be greatly appreciated!

Also worth mentioning that in test mode, it shows that the water tank is empty but it is actually full to the max level, when in normal mode the only lights showing are the red triangle, single and double cup.

If I missed out any information or you need further questions I'd be more than happy to assist.

An office feels cold and drab, like something out of Severence. No one wants that.

What people long for is the warmth of being together with friends. Our competitors are working towards a world of metrics-driven hyper-productivity. We’re taking a contrarian stance.


Teracy is building cozy productivity. Moments like:

・Sitting next to a friend in a coffee shop

・Working late at night in your school library

・Discussing ideas with friends on a beautiful lawn

These are moments I want to emulate through Teracy.
To use Teracy, simply open the app, create a space, and invite your friends. You’ll have a co-working space you’ll want to open every day. There’s no pressure to talk, just the quiet presence of someone working beside you.

Over the past year, we’ve run a private beta, gathered tons of feedback, and iterated. This release is the culmination of everything I’ve built.

To get started, download Teracy here and invite your friends.

If you want to try it yourself, you can also access public rooms that are filled with fellow builders from around the world.

“You know who you’re speaking with, do ya?”

I didn’t. But I also didn’t trust the sound of his voice; it was too mechanical, too inhuman.

“Um, well...” My phone felt heavy in my hand.

“This is Lester, you idiot!”

He said his last name, but I couldn’t comprehend it – the name doesn’t exist in our reality – so I smartly kept my mouth shut. I was exhausted, and needing my morning coffee. I groaned. Why did I call that number before coffee?

“I run the music biz!”

That caught my attention. I regarded the business card Ivan gave me the previous night; it had no name on it, only a phone number and email address, plus a creepy symbol of an eyeball floating over a treble clef.

“So,” I said slowly, while lumbering toward the coffee maker, “what does this mean for me?”

An uncomfortable silence ensued, long enough for me to fill the coffee maker. Finally, as I was about to repeat the question, Lester – presumably a lizard person – spoke up.

“I want to record you, you idiot! Why else would I have you contact me?”

More silence. After the horrific week I’d had, my tolerance for nonsense had greatly diminished. I filled my mug to the brim and had a sip. The caffeine came quickly to my aid.

“Say that again,” I said, buying time. “This time, nicer.”

Lester chuckled; it was a heartless laugh. Already, I was suspicious. Monsters, I’d learned the hard way, are not to be trusted.

“I run the music biz,” he repeated himself. “Most of it, anyhow. But with the emergence of AI, I could lose everything. I need another hit song. Fast.”

He paused.

I gulped the coffee and refilled my mug.

“I’m not gonna name drop,” he continued, “but let’s just say I’ve helped many pop artists over the past twenty-five years.”

I didn’t believe him. But as a freelance musician, I didn’t dismiss him either. This could be my big break.

“Soooo,” he slithered, “Frank...”

“Hank,” I interrupted.

“Right, Hank.” He hissed. “I’ll cut to the chase. The monster community feels grossly unrepresented in the music community. Unfortunately, they can’t carry a tune to save their lives. Not even autotune can help. Believe me, we’ve tried.”

I ran to the washroom, and urinated. Why was I having this conversation before noon?

Lester kept talking, “We like your rendition of Last Train to Deathsville...”

Ugh, that song again.

“I want to record you playing it live. Then I’ll have my guys fix it up. We’ll do a remix, slap on a pretty face, and voila! Hit song.”

Remix? Really? I couldn't believe it. Then again, was I really shocked that the music biz was run by lizards? And what did he mean by ‘slapping on a pretty face?’

“Which means...” I tried to think of something clever to say, and failed, “the song won’t be under my name?”

“Don’t play dumb!” he snapped. “You’re ugly. And stupid. But you have a nice voice. And you play a mean piano. You’ll be properly compensated for your efforts, of course. But you’ll need to sign a contract, and keep your mouth shut. Except, of course, when you’re singing.”

This was his attempt at humor. I wanted to stick a fork in my ears. “How much money are we talking?”

He made me an offer; one I couldn’t refuse. The piano – which was destroyed by a pack of dogmen – would be replaced, he promised. (And taken off my pay, of course).

He emailed me a contract, and I signed it.

And that’s how I started writing songs for monsters. A decision I deeply regret.

When I showed up for the gig that night, there was a keyboard waiting for me. It looked really expensive. Top of the line. I ignored the prying eyes penetrating me, and meandered towards the minuscule stage.

As I passed the bar, Ivan shouted, “Hank!”

I stopped. Hearing monsters speak my name is something I’ll never get used to.

“The man of the hour.” Ivan was surrounded by a lounge of lizard people dressed like old fashioned pimps: purple suits, polyester, high-heeled boots and bowties. The way they licked their faces was sickening.  “Everything is all set up for you.”

His eyes were gleaming, his hair extra greasy. I spotted a splattering of blood on his cheek.

As I pulled away, he said, “Here. The boss wanted you to have this.”

He handed me a list of songs; none of which were real, of course.

I took the list, and found my way to the keyboard. At least the keys weren’t bones. I fiddled with the settings and tested the microphone. Everything, it seemed, was good to go.

A throbbing spotlight found me. Already, I was sweating. I tried not to notice the headless zombies sitting in the front row. Not only did they stink, they were shoving plates of food and drink down their necks. I nearly vomited. Why were they even here? They couldn’t see me, nor could they hear the music. None of this made any sense.

The lizards sitting around the bar stared at me with beady little eyes. I wondered which one was Lester. Probably the one sitting in the middle, with the checkered suit and dark sunglasses. On cue, he waved and licked his face. I gagged.

There were thirteen songs on the list. Ten of which I knew from the previous night. The others I’d have to make up on the fly and hope for the best.

I opened with Deathsville – the song Lester planned on recording – and nailed it. The monsters went crazy, packing the dance floor. Food and drinks were spilled. Before I started the next song, the pixie flew over and blew me a kiss on the cheek, much to the dismay of Bronzie the Brute. He came over and punched me square in the nose.

My face exploded.

Pain was instantaneous. I needed medical assistance. Fast. Blood was pouring out of me like spilled wine. Bronzie was standing over me, fists like anvils, ready to rumble. I closed my eyes and prepared for the worst.

To my surprise, Ivan came rushing to my aid. “Get him out of here” he shouted, pointing to Bronzie.

A team of security rushed over and dragged Bronzie away. The headless zombies were standing over me, poking me with their pudgy fingers. Ivan shoved them aside and threatened to have them ejected.

I must’ve fainted, because I awoke in a stuffy office next to the kitchen. Ivan was patching me up. I was leaking blood by the barrelful, and in great distress. I didn’t trust the way his eyes sparkled at the site of my blood. Pain meds were offered, and I gobbled them.

Tony came charging into the office. “Did you get what you needed?” he asked Lester.

Lester nodded.

“Excellent.”

They shuffled out of the office and started bickering back and forth.

I sat slumped on an uncomfortable chair. The office stank. Even with my broken nose, I could smell the rot and decay. An aging laptop sat atop a rickety wooden desk, with pencils and pens scattered across it. Next to it was a picture of Tony with his hideous children – all boys as far as I could tell – plus his picturesque wife, who looked like a robot. Brown boxes were stacked to the ceiling. Weapons were scattered haphazardly around the room: machine guns, pistols, knives, handcuffs. You name it. Plus, weapons I couldn’t comprehend, nor wanted to.

Tony and Ivan were still bickering; I heard Tony ask, “What are we gonna do with him?”

“We can’t kill him,” Ivan said. “We need more songs.”

My heart turned to ice. I needed to escape. But how? If I could get my hands on some serious cash, I could split. Move up to Canada, perhaps. They’d never find me there; it’s too cold.

By now, the pain meds were making me queasy; I tried not to faint again. Tony reentered the office. He came over, grabbed my face, and snapped my nose back into place.  I screamed; the pain was extraordinary. He slapped me across the face, and told me to shut up, then he knelt down on one knee and put his fatty face close to mine. His breath was unforgivable.

“Listen here, you little shit.” His face was twisted and bent, his eyes cold and calculated. “You’re lucky we need you. Otherwise...” he cracked his knuckles.

Ivan spoke next. “We have what we need,” he assured Tony. “The song is already in preproduction. It should be out next week. Two weeks, tops.” He regarded me pitifully. “First take, too.” He laughed horribly as he patted me on the back.

I wanted to die. Death would be better than this. A strange aroma was coming from the kitchen. I looked over and gagged. The cooks – squid-like creatures wearing bloodstained aprons – were serving up human brains.

“Get him home,” Tony ordered. He snapped his fingers. A pair of giants entered the office and dragged me towards the back door. They threw me out, then kicked me in the ribs for good measure.

My face was numb, my ribs hurt like hell, and my legs were wobbly. With tremendous effort, I lifted myself to my feet and regarded the long flight of stairs leading to the deserted parking lot. There were bloodstains on the stairs. And graffiti.

“I’ve got to leave town,” I muttered. “Pronto.”  As I was halfway up the stairs, the back door opened.

Ivan poked out. “You forgot something,” he said. His pasty lips stretched as he spoke. He was holding an envelope stuffed with enough cash to replace my crappy Honda.

I loped downstairs and snatched it.

“See ya Tuesday,” he said, before slamming the door in my face.

Once home, I plopped onto my bed, trembling. Everywhere, I hurt. How did I get myself in the mess? But I knew the answer. The Redhead. She was to blame. Whoever she was. I closed my eyes and succumbed to nightmares.

The weekend went by in a drunken blur. I drank enough whiskey and beer to forget my problems, something I hadn’t done since college. But I was lonely. And scared. Every time I looked out my window, a black SUV drove past. Sometimes it was parked across the street. Waiting.

They were watching me.

Why was I surprised?

By Tuesday I was sick of booze and sick of my one one-bedroom unit, and sick of being alone. Mostly, I was sick of monsters. Yes, I had more songs to sing. But this time, I was prepared. This time, I’d have my [revenge](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesFromStarr)",2,1760109450.0,TheCrypticCompendium,0,1.0,False
1o33rbw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Europetravel/comments/1o33rbw/a_weekend_in_málaga_my_experience_and_impressions/,"A weekend in Málaga: My experience and impressions around it's food, the city itself and other aspects","I recently attended a wedding in Málaga (a city I had never visited before), and here are my thoughts:

We spent two days exploring Málaga in mid-September. We flew from Amsterdam to Madrid, then took a high-speed train to Málaga, which got us there in just about two and a half hours. The train ride was incredible—the views were stunning, and the seats were nothing like airplane seats, which usually feel like sitting in a matchbox.

We spent half the trip in the dining car, enjoying a sandwich, coffee, and some toasted bread with tomato and ham.

When we arrived in Málaga, we immediately understood why so many people want to visit the city. The weather was perfect—around 82°F (28°C)—though quite humid, but the city itself was breathtaking.

As we walked past shops and restaurants, the air was filled with the aroma of candied almonds and fried dishes typical of the city.

The wedding took place at Málaga’s City Hall, which, by the way, has beautiful architecture and interiors.

The celebration and dinner were held later at a beachside *chiringuito* (a seaside restaurant).

When it comes to the food, the highlights were definitely the *jamón serrano* croquettes, the *boquerones al limón* (fried anchovies marinated in a lemony, spiced batter), and the grilled cuttlefish.

One interesting local custom I noticed: in Málaga, it’s quite common to serve *jamón serrano* with roasted almonds. At first, it seemed like an odd combination, but once you try it, the flavors just make sense together.

And then there’s the wine… Spanish wine is among the best I’ve ever had. While French and Italian wines are excellent too, Spanish wine has a flavor that pairs perfectly with food—a great balance between the oaky notes from the barrel and the natural sweetness of the grapes.

Even though it was a quick trip, the weekend was absolutely perfect. Still, after chatting with some guests, here are a few takeaways:

People in Málaga are used to tourists, but the influx of expats and visitors has reached its limit. Many locals are frustrated because some tourists don’t know how to behave, and landlords prefer to rent to foreigners who pay higher prices rather than to locals.

So if you visit Málaga, try to blend in. Don’t be a disruptive tourist or stick to fast-food chains. That kind of tourism is really frowned upon, and there’s a growing “Tourists go home” movement in the city.

I hope this article gave you a taste of Málaga’s gastronomy and its local quirks!

He broke me 😭😭,"While on a trip to Italy, I met a guy he was 34 (I’m 23 )who worked at the hotel bar. He was always smiling, polite, and it was clear he found me attractive. I gave him some sweets from my country, and he loved them, so I handed him the whole box😂I saw him few time and in total probably spoken to him for 2 hours. On my last day, I said goodbye and asked if he wanted to grab a drink after work. He told me I was a very beautiful girl but he had a girlfriend, so he couldn’t. I respected that, and we parted on good terms — he said he hoped to see me again someday.

A week after I returned home, I found him on Instagram and added him. Two months later, he messaged me saying he’d love to see me — he was now single. He told me my age was not a problem but he did normally date girls his age…For six months, we texted and FaceTimed, laughing a lot and never crossing any inappropriate lines. He planned to visit me in October, but I couldn’t wait, so I booked a trip with my mum in September to a hotel near where he lived. I thought she could go enjoy the town and I will stay with him. 

He was so happy I was coming, counting down the days. I brought him the sweets he really liked , and a shirt with his favorite band. When I arrived, he invited me over, cooked dinner, wine, and we spent the evening watching movies and cuddling, kissing so gentle and sweet, he kept looking at me smiling and kissing my forehead.We didn’t sleep together that night. The next day we went for coffee, lunch,walked around, and he took me on his motorbike. That night I stayed over,and we became intimate. It was loving, tender, and felt real. He was so delicate with me kept asking if I’m okay kissing my hands my neck. I spend most of the night on his chest. We fell asleep in each other’s arms, his face was on my face literally felt his every breath. Even his little cat came under the covers and slept with us. Durning the night I was cold he woke up and went got me extra blankets. He kept kissing my hand every time I moved in my sleep I felt it🥹

The next day he took me on a beautiful bike ride along the Sorrento coast, and later we watched movies and fell asleep together again. When I told him I had to go pack for my flight, as I was up early he held me tightly in silence for a few minutes , he didn’t want to let go, he almost turned into a child that just didn’t want me to go. Just so raw and vulnerable 😫😫We layed there while I was moving my hand through his hair and he kept kissing my hands— it felt so emotional and real. He dropped me off to my hotel on his bike and picked me off the floor and kissed me so fucking passionately. he said  his goodbyes and thanked me for coming over. When I said I’d love to see him again, he said he’d be very busy until January ( he has 2 jobs) but that we’d see each other sometime — he just didn’t know when.

That broke my heart. I spent 500 euros on hotel and tickets took days off work, brought gifts, and shared such intimate moments — and now it felt like he didn’t care if we ever met again. After I got home, four days passed with no message, so I texted him saying I loved our time together and asked if we could plan something. He replied, “What do you mean plan? I told you I’m busy until January sorry “

I just can’t believe someone who seemed so happy and affectionate with me can’t find even one day to see me again when I’m offering to fly to him 😟😟 He managed to take 3 days off then and didn’t even know me so why not now after we had such beautiful moments that were not just sex. There was much more kissing cuddling and talking… 
I’m lost 😞 before him I only had one long term bf so he was the second person in my life.
I feel so stupid I can’t comprehend that those loving moments we had meant nothing. 😣

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

1o33j8e,https://www.reddit.com/r/composting/comments/1o33j8e/bokashi_comprehensive_guide/,bokashi comprehensive guide,"Hello friends,

I posted this on the r/bokashi sub  a while back and forgot to post here as well, so here it is!

I've been experimenting with bokashi and biological innoculants for composting and garding for a while and i wanted to write a detailed post with all of the information i've gathered through out this process to help beginners have some basic understanding of the process to be able to experiment better and have some options while doing so. So here it is!

I'm not a micro biologist , so this explanation is based on my understanding from 2 years of research and experimentation with different ways of making the liquid culture and bokashi bran. Feel free to do your own research and please correct me if I'm wrong about any of this.

So bokashi is not true composting, it is a pre-composting stage that speeds up waste material decomposition and loads the material with beneficial bacteria before breaking it down completely using normal composting methods, basically pre-digesting the organic waste to make it easier for soil micro and macro organisms to finish the process by pickling the food waste using lactobacillus bacteria(LAB). 

 Japanese Prof. Teruo higa refined an ancient traditional process of composting by selecting for specific beneficial anaerobic Effective Micro-organisms(EM) in his innoculant which include lactic acid bacteria(lactobacillus strains) , yeast and photosynthetic bacteria as the 3 major families of beneficial anaerobic bacteria(many different strains of each to my understanding). There are many companies that produce commercial EM currently and each company has their own proprietary mixed culture of many strains of bacteria that they claim offer different benefits but the base of e of them are aforementioned 3 families of bacteria.

The most studied LAB strain for composting,soil and plant health to my knowledge is lactobacillus plantarum.

The major benefits of using bokashi instead of traditional hot or cold composting imo are:
Speeding up decomposition: the lactic acid and enzymes produced by the bacterial culture soften and breakdown the organic waste to make it much easier and faster for soil micro organisms to finish the process.

Composting animal organic waste:  bokashi can handle material that isn't traditionally composted because of very high nitrogen content and potential for causing problems like attracting critters and smelling very stinky and avoid these issues.
Low PH: the lactic acid produced by the lactobacillus by consuming the simple sugars in the organic waste inhibits the growth of a lot of pathogenic micro organisms and the sour smell deters critters away from the compost.

High beneficial bacteria load: the organic waste is pre-loaded with beneficial bacteria that offer alot of benefits to plants including growth stimulation, pathogen inhibition, neutrients solubalization and creating suitable habitat for other beneficial micro organisms to colonize the compost and nitrogen fixation just to name a few. 
Propagating EM1: this is the most reliable method, mix commercial EM with mollases and water at a 1:1:19 ratio and let it ferment for a week or 2. You can experiment with fermenting it in indirect light to promote photosynthetic bacteria propagation as well.

Traditional method for making LAB: according to Korean Natural Farming(KNF) , you can make a wild LAB culture by letting rice wash water ferment for 2 weeks and then mixing it with milk 1:10 and letting ferment again for a week with a breathable lid, this method selects for LAB by using lactose from the milk as the as the primary simple sugar to promote LAB colonization in the liquid culture. This has the added benefit of using locally adapted strains of LAB already present in your environment and the starches from the rice water also promote some fungal diversity. This method can be hit and miss imo depending on your local environment and the micro organisms that happen to be present on the material you used. Generally the lactic acid inhibits the majority of pathogens if the lactic acid bacteria are able to outcompete other micro organisms in time but some pathogens are resistant.

I like to use an otc probiotic that has l.plantarum in it to ensure i have sufficient population for it to colonize the starter culture and then experiment with mixing it with other wild cultures, the propagation method is the same , mix the probiotic with water and mollases amd let it ferment for some time ratios not really important within reason , if you really want to ensure the culture is stable according to terragnix the ph of the liquid culture should be below 4. You can also experiment with adding starchy liquids from this like potatoes , rice, etc. To promote fungal diversity in the liquid culture.

None of these liquid cultures are pure cultures as they are not done under sterile conditions but the idea is that the low inhibits most of the unwanted pathogenic micro organisms.

You can use any of the aforementioned liquid culture to soak a powdered substrate like grain bran , sawdust, shredded paper, coffee grounds , etc. And ferment it anaerobically for a week or 2 and dry it to make bokashi bran. 

The bokashi buckets setup is very simple, you need a bucket with a sealing lid(raised bottom and tap to drain liquid optional) and you add the food waste periodically and alternate it with layers of bokashi bran, compress it to get out air pockets and keep it sealed between additions. When the bucket is full you seal it and let it ferment for at least a week, i've had buckets forgotten for over 6 months on my patio with no issues , it doesn't go bad, the longer you ferment it the faster it breaks down in soil. After the bucket is done fermenting you can use is as a soil amendment, bury it your yard , use it as a compost accelerator in a hot compost pile , or mix it and bury it in any container(soil factory) , if your soil is dry and dead the process might benefit from adding a little bit of high quality compost to introduce soil micro organisms, it can also be used in a worm farm after curing it in a soil factory for a while as the acidity might irritate the worms initially.

The liquid culture or dry culture(bran) can also be used as a soil amendment and foilar spray and to ferment organic waste to make fermented plant juice(FPJ) which is an organic liquid fertilizer. Also these cultures and bokashi don't have to be used in a strictly organic gardening setup , it also offers a lot of benefits when used with synthetic fertilizer , what you want to try to avoid while using biological gardening amendments are chemical pesticides if possible.

Some other well studied beneficial micro organisms to further research if interested that can be used as well to solve many other problems and enhance overall gardening/farming experience.

Trichoderma: a predatory fungus that outcompetes and inhibits soil fungal diseases and root rot issues
Mycorrhizae: a symbiotic fungus that has many growth promoting properties.

Bacillus Thuregensis: a bacteria used as a biopesticide for many kinda of larvae of pests.

Beauveria bassiana: an Entomopathogenic fungus that infects and kills many pest insects used as a bio insecticide.

There are many more but those are the ones I'm aware of.

Some additional resources to nerd out on if anyone's interested. 

Prof. Teruo higa's book on EM:An Earth Saving Revolution: A Means to Resolve Our World's Problems Through Effective Microorganisms (EM)

Matt powers youtube channel has multiple videos on EM and discusses different customized composting techniques to solve a lot of gardening/farming problems.

Dr. Christine jones and Dr. Elaine ingham work on soil ecosystems and quorum sensing: not directly related to EM or bokashi but it is scientific research on the roles of microorganisms in promoting soil and plant health.

Chris trump's KNF channel: not very scientific but it documents the traditional methods of Korean natural farming which alot of the scientific methods are refined , studied and derived from.

( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

1o33dje,https://i.redd.it/wzlmduzkuauf1.jpeg,IGHRA'A By Ahmed Al Maghrabi an alt for Sauvage Elixer.,"Disclaimer: I don’t own the original, so this review is purely based on my personal experience with this fragrance — not a comparison.

Many reviews mention that it’s an excellent alternative to Dior Sauvage Elixir, which is known to be the darker and more masculine version among the Sauvage line. This fragrance comes with a pressurized atomizer and around 40% oil concentration, making it a potent performer that literally lasts for days on clothes.

While Lattafa Asad is quite popular in the market, this fragrance is seriously slept on. It’s incredibly masculine, seductive, and yes — women absolutely love it.

The moment you spray it, you’re hit with a strong burst of spices, especially black pepper and nutmeg. As it settles, cardamom and grapefruit emerge, blending beautifully with a fougère, soapy lavender that stays throughout the life of the scent. In the dry-down, you’ll notice hints of earthy patchouli and a subtle touch of coffee, which, though not dominant, adds depth. Finally, the sandalwood base gives the fragrance a slightly powdery and creamy finish.

Surely not a safe blind buy, but if you do decide to get it, you’ll definitely enjoy the scent. I picked this up three days ago, and I’m already planning to use it like crazy this winter. I’m sure the fragrance will evolve over time and more of the hidden notes will start to shine through — so yeah, I’ll give it some time to really develop.",3,1760108619.0,DesiFragranceAddicts,6,1.0,False

1o33ayj,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1o33ayj/why_choose_waterdrop_wdg3w_replacement_undersink/,Why Choose Waterdrop WD-G3-W Replacement Under-Sink Filter Review for Pure Water?,"The Waterdrop WD-G3-W replacement filter bundle has been a daily companion for weeks in my kitchen routine, promising consistent and purified water for every need. Designed as a replacement for the WD-G3-W, WD-G3P600, and WD-G3P800-W reverse osmosis systems, these filters cater to a niche market of homeowners who prioritize top-quality water filtration. After testing it extensively, both strengths and areas for improvement were evident.

**Ease of Installation**

This was surprisingly straightforward, which is not something I say about most home improvement products. Replacing the filters genuinely took less than three seconds—no tools, no mess, and certainly no frustration. A simple twist to the right and the new filter clicks into place. Even my spouse, who hates dealing with household maintenance tasks, found it ridiculously easy. Convenience is clearly a high priority here.

**Build Quality**

Crafted from coconut shell-based activated carbon, these filters scream eco-consciousness, which resonates with my family’s values. The smaller pore size ensures that residual chlorine and organic materials get adequately filtered. I was initially skeptical about whether I'd notice a difference in taste, but even a water snob like me could detect the elimination of odors and impurities, resulting in noticeably fresher water. However, it may be worthwhile to check for coconut allergies within your household, as the material plays a central role.

**Positives**

- Installation in under three seconds without any tools.
- Significant improvement in water taste, leaving it crisp and clean.
- Premium-quality coconut shell-activated carbon for eco-conscious consumers.
- Compatible with multiple models, making it versatile for a range of users.

[Grab Waterdrop WD-G3-W price on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b0cy1j2fjz/)

**Filtration Performance**

The filtration performance genuinely stands out. The water quality isn't just improved; the taste becomes almost addictive. Tap water, when filtered through this, feels more enjoyable even compared to bottled water. It’s a perfect choice if you hate the hint of chlorine or that metallic aftertaste from older piping. With this, coffee, tea, and even boiled vegetables tasted noticeably better. Testing it back-to-back with unfiltered water made the comparison feel almost unfair.

**Compatibility and Target Audience**

This replacement filter is tailormade for those using the WD-G3 series systems. If you’re already invested in Waterdrop's OS hardware, this purchase feels like a given. But for users of other systems, compatibility becomes a restrictive factor—I'd double-check product specifications to ensure this model will actually work for your setup before purchasing.

**Drawbacks**

- Has limited compatibility outside of the WD-G3 series.
- Coconut-shell materials may not suit users with allergies.
- Slightly pricey compared to generic filters (but quality does justify it if you’re serious about water).

**Competing Products**

I also compared this product to other under-sink filters like Brita’s replacement cartridges and Culligan’s filter series. While Brita is globally renowned for its brand presence, the taste and quality felt lagging when compared side-by-side with Waterdrop's crisp results. Culligan impressed me with durability; however, its replacement installation was frustrating in comparison. Waterdrop excelled here with its efficiency but did lose marks on the limited compatibility with non-Waterdrop systems. Still, for users of the WD-G3 family, the smooth installation process and quality outweigh these concerns entirely.

**Price to Quality Ratio**

Considering the cost of some replacement filters available on the market, the price for the Waterdrop replacement filter feels justified if water purity is a priority in your household. It’s an investment that pays off in terms of consistent performance. Many cheaper options skimp on filtration capacity or ease of use—this bundle doesn’t compromise in these areas. Knowing my family uses this every single day, from drinking water to preparing meals, makes every penny feel well spent.

*Moncilat Prime, Foreign Terran Legion Ship* Freelord's Gyrfalcon

Captain Drysel glanced around, still getting accustomed to the new bridge layout. On the one hand this was part of the shakedown; on the other hand there were still the occasional incursions from the outer portions of the system - ships that jumped in and left before they could get anything more than a basic type scan, never in the same place twice. He tapped his fingers nervously on the chair of his arm, finally looking to his XO.

""Analysis, Teemu?""

His XO leaned back a bit; Teemu's form and a few of his mannerisms had changed along with the ship. He seemed a touch more aggressive, like a defensive footballer converting to offense. His voice still held the same warm rounded tones it had. ""Freelord, if I didn't know better, I'd say whoever's doing that is doing some fishing. They're taking on a bit of a pattern and avoiding the standard cross-system jump points. We'll need about five more appearances before I can confirm it.""

""Can we divert the local Militia patrol ships to scan and prepare?""

""We can, but they're truly only good for scans and defense.""

""Then we utilize them as such."" Drysel nodded toward his comm station, addressing the only Terran bridge crewman currently on station. ""Whistler, request the local patrol ships swing wide through the system and leave a few passive buoys. I'd like more information before we move in. Then message the *Lofty Mountain* and the *Fjordhammer* to pass by the buoys after the next jump and pull the data.""

There was a nod as the tall-even-for-a-Terran whistled softly as he tapped and opened a channel to relay the request. ""Done and dusted; also, the *Twilight Rose* is going to be in-system in a few days. Mailburst came in with the latest, they did their usual thing and they just left Terra.""

Drysel swallowed nervously. ""Thank you, Whistler.""

Teemu sniffed at his captain. ""Sir, I've got five credits that say Freelord Gryzzk can smell your nervousness from R-space. You've taken several ships, collected bounties, and you cleaned up the bases that he missed. The Throne's Fortune groups are theoretically smart enough to work a comm station, which means they talk. Freelord Drysel and the Foreign Terran Legion are not to be fucked with, and they know that.""

""Not everyone - there appear to be a certain group of fishermen who are rather dedicated to discovering our capabilities."" Drysel sipped at a cup of rich dark coffee before speaking again. ""Also, I'd like to know what's happening in Draconis. A few of the prisoners we spoke to said there's someone new in the system cobbling together a fleet for something.""

""Respectfully Freelord you have just described every system in the galaxy."" The XO's voice held its usual dry sarcasm.

""I should like to know more about what's happening there.""

""So would just about everyone else. Kindly stop trying to fight two wars at once before I message Freelady Dinoae. She would not be offended to spend an evening consulting with you.""

Drysel took a deep breath and held it for a moment. ""Freelady Dinoae has made her feelings quite clear.""

There was a soft snort from tactical, as Cleista turned to look at the command chair with amusement. ""Freelady Dinoae is a traditionalist. The year of testing has begun - and begun well. At worst, her clan will owe yours a child. At best, two clans become one. She looks after her clan first, even above her own desires.""

Drysel sipped his coffee and considered. ""Thank you for the information. Now about the sides of your skull..."" he indicated the freshly-shaved-and-tattoed portion of his tactical NCO's head, which complemented the normal warbraids. If Drysel was being completely fair, it didn't look too bad, but he was quite certain such a fashion statement would have put Lord A'bantir in the hospital from shock.

""Ran out of room on my shoulders, Freelord. Didn't want to give my new clan any less of a position just because it's led by a Vilantian.""

""Fair enough.""

*Terran Foreign Legion Ship* Twilight Rose

Gryzzk wasn't entirely sure about the cause of it, but the ship felt warmer somehow. He'd consulted with Rosie and confirmed that the ambient temperatures hadn't changed. His mandated recreation hours had been cut in half, but he still lingered to talk to whoever was around. Gro'zel was almost constantly in motion, listening to recordings and helping the unlettered with their words - the rumor was that she had shamelessly offered feathers and bird-skritches as rewards for good work at reading. Movie nights were something of a treat; *The Clanlord Sighs Forever* was a hit on the second night in R-space, with the Clanlord attempting to marry each of his would-be spouses in turn and each wedding being interrupted by some crisis or another. He'd even caught Delia wearing a t-shirt and talking to all the pregnant women the next morning.

But this was their last evening in R-Space and it was Moncilat Day. Rosie was making a general announcement every hour with some fact or another about the Moncilat homeworld. Some facts were interesting, like the fact that traditional Moncilat craftsmanship didn't use tools, instead they grew things using the local wood in combination with shaped crystals from Moncilat V in order to produce bespoke items of daily life. To Gryzzk it seemed a bit tedious, but Yomios seemed quite proud of the fact.

There was a soft bugle call of the speaker system, alerting Gryzzk to the latest fact. ""This hour's Moncilat Fact is brought to you by Apeldorn Farms, where she's always knee high by the 4th of July and the ugliest Apeldorn'll be the first to tell you. So did you know that out of all the species in the Collective, the Moncilat were the only ones to invent fur-care product before the wheel? You do now. Rosie out for another hour.""

Gryzzk was going to have to check with Miroka on that later.

As he approached the dayroom he felt the subtle shifts before he saw the multitude of warnings that the area gravity had been tuned to Moncilat standard. With that, he entered the dayroom and felt his stomach flip slightly. Rosie was there with most of the off-duty company members as they began looking forward to a few days off. From what he'd heard, there were several individuals who were planning an excursion to the surface later.

At the normal lectern for announcements, Yomios and Miroka were standing and looking a bit concerned while O'Brien waited for the crowd to settle down. Being more than idle curiosities was something novel and possibly a bit frightening for the two, and their postures reflected that. They were using the sergeant major as something of a shield while she spoke as their eyes kept swiveling toward the exit.

""...now I know you got questions, and these two tall drinks of water'll answer as many as they can. Normally I'd say there are no stupid questions, but I don't tempt fate like that. There are stupid questions, and anyone who asks them - *Reilly* \- might find a surprise in their duty roster on the way home. So think long and hard before you ask how Moncilat take a piss.""

Reilly tried to look offended at being called out. ""Question - why am I always the bad behavior example?!""

O'Brien gestured. ""See? Stupid question, right there. Totally forgets her first question about the major was 'Is he single?', and also conveniently ignores the fact that her normal shore leave outfit is commando...so. Reilly, ask your stupid question.""

Reilly stood and grinned. ""So, question for Yomios - scale of one to ten, how loud is Miroka when Hoban's taking her to Pound Town?""

There were scattered groans and O'Brien shook her head. ""Reilly, you are the reason we have warning labels on our warning labels.""

Reilly managed to look indignant as she replied. ""It's a legitimate sociological question - I was gonna ask Miroka the same thing about how loud Yomios gets when U'wekrupp is introducing Tab A to Slot B. ""

O'Brien glanced at the pair of Moncilat who were both varying degrees of embarrassed that their proclivities had been publicly advertised, rather than quietly noted and commented upon. ""Corporals you are authorized to give yon horny bint one smack upside the head after the movies are done. For the record Reilly, I noted the cargo lockers are filthy as I passed through earlier today.""

The rest of the Q&A went fairly smoothly, with only a few hiccups when something didn't quite scan culturally. The oddest part of Moncilat society was that they didn't have deities or objects of worship. When pressed, the Moncilat simply shrugged awkwardly and whispered for a moment before Yomios admitted that according to their history, the gods had been devoured by the predators of Moncilat before the predators themselves destroyed each other. Other than that, the questions ranged from the innocuous (""What is the obsession with chocolate?"") to the curious (""What's the worst gravity-related injury you've had?"") to the Reilly-inspired (""Just how illegal is streaking on Moncilat, and will the cops let you go if turns out you're just wearing Bear Booty Shorts?"")

Gryzzk groaned softly at the more scatological inquiries, and was a bit pleased that the sergeant major was prepared for such inquiries - O'Brien had a small supply of squishy throwable objects for those who earned her ire. A few times she simply chucked one at Reilly for no apparent reason except to remind the comm sergeant to be quiet.

Finally mats were spread on the grass of the dayroom and the lights dimmed for the evening holo, which was advertised as a Moncilat classic. It seemed a romance of sorts, with two large families preparing for a wedding – the clans involved appeared to be of equal status, which created complexity as they were being joined together. There didn't seem to be a single protagonist; rather as each scene developed there appeared to be a protagonist for the scene itself as one family member or another pressed to advance their own plots as each of the family elders took turns at playing a game of stratagem, with scents conflicting as each character seemed to have multiple different goals.

Gryzzk was lost, but attempted to learn the intricacies, slowly sliding his tablet out to make tiny notes before . Finally it seemed that the game had been decided, and the original spouses were set aside in favor of a younger couple - as the twenty-day affair concluded, the original couple in the back whispered their own oaths as the second couple was given the grand ceremony, which involved every guest giving a speech of approval to the new couple. As the holo concluded, the original couple stole away in the night to where a shuttle was waiting to take them away to some unknown destination.

As the lights came back on, Kiole gently elbowed Gryzzk as they walked to her quarters.

""You're not supposed to take notes. It's an entertainment, you should *feel* what's happening and not try to be apart from it."" Her voice was gently reproachful.

""How can I feel something if I'm not sure what the meaning is?""

""Use the senses the gods gave you, husband. Close your eyes and be a part of the experience.""

""So you say.""

""I do. Now kindly guide us to our next destination.""

Gryzzk looked around before giving Kiole a discrete nuzzle. ""Then we go home and give our wife the attention she deserves.""

Kiole softly hummed into Gryzzk's ear. ""I look forward to it with a shiver of antici..."" Kiole let the word hang for a near-eternity. ""...pation.""

Gryzzk shook his head as he walked to the bridge, working on a few things and going through the rosters for shore leave - it seemed that almost everyone was planing on going to Moncilat; and to be fair Gryzzk was considering it. Terran gravity was an experience, and there were probably not going to be many opportunities to experience what life was like at one-third of what he considered normal. That said, he did have two company members who weren't going there. He contemplated if it would be better to stay on the ship and see if he could figure out the subtexts of the movie. There were similar contemplations, but what truly let him staring at the ceiling far longer than it should have was the thought that he was unleashing his company on Moncilat Prime with only a day's notice.

If he was lucky, Reilly would be kept in check by Edwards. Mostly.

In the morning, there was the normal functions of the ship, and Gryzzk was in his command chair in good time for the return to regular space. Hoban casually set course for Moncilat Prime but waited for the checks to be completed before actually moving toward the system.

Edwards called out softly. ""Major, ship on intercept course. Ident says *Freelord's Gyrfalcon*, squawk coming back as Foreign Legion of Terra. Weapons warm, shields are up."" Her voice belied a level of uncertainty, as if there was something amiss that she couldn't put to words.

Gryzzk considered for a moment. ""Maintain course. Sergeant Reilly, hail them when they're in range.""

After almost an hour, communications were established. Gryzzk's face lit up unintentionally when he saw his old friend from the before times.

""Captain Drysel. Moncilat treats you well, I hope?""

It took a moment, but Drysel nodded stiffly. ""It does, Freelord. Our world prospers, and we have you to thank for it.""

Something about Drysel seemed off, and Gryzzk cocked his head slightly. ""Well, it's not just me - my company is quite responsible for our collective success. Just like yours.""

There was a too-casual shrug from the other end. ""It's said that the gods look after fools, children, and ships named *Twilight Rose*.""

This conversation was veering from odd to uncertain. Gryzzk tapped a message to the bridge team, and gave a nod to Rosie to bring the company to readiness. ""Captain Drysel, since we're both here, would it be possible for your ship to make its way to Moncilat Prime in a day or so? Lord A'Ponile would never forgive me were I to treat his Lead Servant poorly.""

The overly enthusiastic scent from the other end brought a chill to Gryzzk's spine. ""That sounds like an excellent idea, Freelord. We could escort you to Moncilat Prime, if you would not be offended.""

Gryzzk kept his own emotions in check to radiate his own pleasant enthusiasm at the prospect. ""I could never be offended at walking next to an old friend."" He nodded to Hoban. ""Captain, maintain current vector and allow Captain Drysel to match."" Gryzzk then returned to regard the holo. ""Apologies, old friend but duty requires a few things of me at the moment. We'll speak again soon.""

There was unbridled enthusiasm from the other end. ""I certainly hope so.""

The transmission ended, and Gryzzk stood, tugging his tunic down snugly. ""XO, stand the company to. Sergeant Major O'Brien, exercise all weapons, Reilly send a message to the militia that we have an issue that needs attending - if they have any weaponized ships we would appreciate their diverting to our position. Edwards, sets scanners to maximum - anything that's not empty space approaches I want to know.""

Everyone immediately set to their tasks, and after setting the weapons up, O'Brien finally glanced back. ""Alright, this is the part where you explain what in the name of Dagda's hairy ballsack is happening.""

Gryzzk's voice was soft. ""That's not the real Captain Drysel.""

""And you know this from a five minute conversation how?""

""When we were on Vilantia, Drysel's sworn lord was Lord A'Bantir - not Lord A'Ponile. Everyone check your stations for something unusual. Whoever that actually was, they have discovered trickery and I should very much like to find out who they are and how large a bounty they have on their heads.""

Reilly was the first to report. ""They don't have anything on the War Frequency. That ain't right - everyone responds to the War Freq, even if it's just telling me to fuck off. So either Whistler's drunk again, or that ain't Whistler.""

Edwards spoke next - and her news was not good. ""Ship configuration looks like they cobbled something together - I think they were trying to put on a fake outer shell and ran out of time or material.""

O'Brien added her two credits afterward. ""Tactical assessment, no railguns. At all. Coming back with some Vilantian plasma turrets gussied up to look like they're railguns. Now I'm kinda curious.""

Gryzzk took the information in for a moment before coming to a decision. ""XO, get the boarding parties loaded to shuttlecraft - whoever they are, I don't want them to get too close.""

Rosie nodded, her form taking on a set of combat armor as various systems activated. ""Alright titfuckers, this is not a drill. Seal off engineering. Non-essential personnel to your quarters, stand by for damage control ops. Boarding parties, load up to your designated shuttles. Set the fuckin' tone and show these mange-farmers that pokin' the bear is a bad idea.""",27,1760108445.0,HFY,9,1.0,False

The diner is typically Boomer Central, and my GenX self is invading their space, so probably my fault in the first place. 

Waiting on my companions, and new Boomer comes in with a dog. I should point out that there is a large sign on the door that says ""due to allergies no dogs allowed."" It's also a seat yourself place so no one said anything when they came in. They take the both behind me. 

Waitress comes over and let's him know that there are no dogs allowed in the restaurant. He IMMEDIATELY goes from zero to sixty. It's a service dog, and it's mandated by the ADA that he's allowed to have it and it's discrimination to even ask him to take the dog out. In five years, no one has ever asked him to take the dog out. Where's Mary? Waitress is blindsided but calm and days she will get Mary for him and exits the scene. 

Apparently, Mary didn't show up quickly enough because when the waitress comes to refill coffee for the table next to us, he gets up and starts to follow her asking if there's not any service for him. She says she let Mary know. He just keeps right on going about the dog being allowed. He's just loud and hateful.

I'd had enough. I say, ""Sir please don't be so hateful this morning.""

""Stay out of it you stupid bitch.""

I stay seated. I'm not going to get in his face ( he was tiny; I could've easily taken him). I tell him to fuck off and to have the day he deserves. (I wish I'd've though to ask about his care giver like y'all have suggested, but alas.) 

He sits back down, stewing. He starts in on me about how his dog is allowed. I told him I don't give a fuck. Even if he's right, he doesn't need to be a dick. He keeps mumbling. Telling me to look up the law. He finally gets mad enough that he leaves. Nobody clapped. 

After about ten minutes, he actually came back and apologized to me. Not the waitress mind you. Just me. Told me to have a blessed day because of course.  So someone somewhere gave him a dressing down that I didn't see. It was a sincere apology. No snark detected. 

When the waitress came back to fill my coffee, I apologized and her response was that is just another day at the restaurant. 

Anyway. I left a $20 tip on a $10 breakfast since she didn't deserve that this morning. Or ever, really. ",30,1760108353.0,BoomersBeingFools,7,0.97,False

1o337ng,https://www.reddit.com/r/AfterOpening/comments/1o337ng/explore_mollys_suds_sink_scrub_does_it_really/,Explore Molly's Suds Sink Scrub Does It Really Shine Your Kitchen,"Testing out Molly's Suds B07PW65M6X Sink Scrub for a week in real-world scenarios felt almost like embarking on a proper cleaning experiment. I have a family of five, which means our sink sees an extraordinary amount of activity daily – piles of greasy pans from dinner, coffee cups resting in the sink after breakfast, and the occasional marker stains from kids' craft adventures. This scrub had a lot to prove, and I was eager to see whether it lived up to its claims.

**A Fresh Citrus Aroma That Stands Out**  
One of the first things I noticed about this product was its delightful citrus scent. It’s a blend of sweet lemon and light herbal undertones – incredibly fresh and clean without being overwhelming. Scrubbing away stains and grime almost felt therapeutic with this scent filling the room. The aroma gave our sink and surrounding area a freshness that lasted for hours.  

**Ease of Application**  
Using this cleaner couldn’t have been simpler. The instructions advise sprinkling a bit of the scrub onto the surface, giving it a gentle scrub with a brush or sponge, then rinsing it off. On day one of testing, I used it on an embarrassingly greasy pan. The scrub worked through the caked-on mess with ease, leaving no scratches behind—a definite win. Its baking soda formulation does all the heavy lifting without being too abrasive.  

[Check Molly's Suds B07PW65M6X price on Amazon.](https://go.senaar.com/p/b07pw65m6x/)  

**Versatile Cleaning Genius**  
This isn’t just limited to the kitchen sink. Over the week, I discovered that the scrub is equally effective for bathrooms, pots and pans, and even a couple of carpet stains my toddler ""tested"" it on. Whether it was the bathtub that collects soap scum or the stovetop with grease spills, this cleaner came through consistently without any harsh chemical smells or residue. My niece (who has sensitive skin) used it barehanded without issue, which says a lot about its gentle formulation.  

**Strengths**  
- Exceptional citrus scent that lingers for a pleasant clean feeling.  
- Multi-purpose: works not only on sinks but also on other surfaces like tubs, pans, and carpets.  
- Gentle yet effective; doesn't scratch delicate surfaces.  
- Eco-friendly ingredients that feel safe to use around kids and pets.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Packaging isn’t resealable, making long-term storage a bit tricky.  
- The product could benefit from a slightly more granular texture for tougher stains—it sometimes takes a bit more scrubbing effort.  

**Product Competitors**  
Compared to similar products like Bar Keeper's Friend or Bon Ami, Molly's Suds sets itself apart with its plant- and mineral-based formula. Bar Keeper's Friend may offer slightly more abrasive power for stubborn grime, but it lacks the appealing citrus scent and gentle formulation. Bon Ami, while gentle, doesn’t quite have the versatility that this scrub offers. This cleaner nails the right balance between being tough on messes but kind to surfaces, making it user-friendly for households with kids and pets. It’s precisely this versatility and eco-conscious approach that makes it shine.  

**Price Worthiness**  
Considering what you’re getting here—a safe, eco-friendly, multi-purpose all-surface cleaner—the value is exceptional. Many competing brands with similar features tend to fall into a higher price bracket, which makes this product stand out. While it’s not the cheapest option, it offers an undeniable balance of quality for the price. Chemical-heavy products might be a tad cheaper, but the peace of mind that comes with this cleaner’s natural formulation is worth the trade-off.

1o337gm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Regretsy/comments/1o337gm/searching_for_meaning_of_life_here_is_practical/,searching for meaning of life ? here is Practical explanation - Nigrhitani,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

I travel a ton for work, so I’m on the road more than I’m home. Honestly makes online friendships way easier to maintain than trying to coordinate schedules in person. Though if we click and you happen to be around when I’m actually in town, I’m always down to grab coffee or catch a game. When I do have downtime, I’m definitely a homebody who watches way too much TV. I’m always in the middle of three different series, and I also love baseball, soccer, and hockey so fall/winter is my happy place with games always on in the background. Yes I’m a Mariners fan. Yes I know what I signed up for. The pain is part of the experience at this point.

When I’m actually home and not parked on my couch you might find me hiking when it’s not freezing cold, experimenting with cookie recipes, or wandering through local coffee shops with a book. I’m into fantasy novels and true crime, I burn through candles like it’s my job, and I genuinely love getting to know new people through conversation. I’ve been told I’m a pretty great listener and I think there’s something special about real connection, even if it starts online.

I’m hoping to meet people who are down for chatting about life, swapping show recommendations, talking about whatever game is on, or just having those random conversations about nothing and everything. 

I love long messages, and actually getting to know someone beyond surface level stuff.

1o33557,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o33557,Meet the crimson spider,"Theron Kaine grew up learning how to survive on his own, in silence.

His mother, a high powered lawyer, was always in court, too busy defending the guilty to notice the son she was slowly losing. His father, Dr. Elias Kaine, a lead scientist at Oscorp, was more obsessed with his research than with family dinners. That left Theron to raise himself. a boy molded by neglect, discipline, and intellect.

He became the kind of student teachers whispered about, an academic prodigy with a cold stare. A natural athlete, yet detached from every social circle. The kind of brilliance that made others uncomfortable.

When Oscorp opened its doors to a select group of ten exceptional students, Theron was at the top of the list. It was supposed to be a reward — a glimpse into the future of science. Instead, it became the day his life burned to ash.

Behind the pristine walls and green glass labs, Dr. Kaine had discovered something monstrous: the SOLDIER program, a secret Oscorp initiative to create bio enhanced super soldiers using hybridized DNA — human and animal. When he tried to expose them, Norman Osborn silenced him the only way he knew how: by turning him into an experiment.

When Theron arrived for the tour, his father was no longer human. The serum had torn his mind apart, leaving only primal instinct and rage. The Lizard was unleashed. The lab erupted into chaos. Screams, alarms, fire. Students fled but the Lizard tore through steel and bone alike.

Theron was left broken and bleeding under the wreckage, his father’s roars echoing through the shattered glass halls.
In desperation, he crawled into a containment wing marked SOLDIER: SPIDER — a prototype program meant to blend arachnid adaptability with human physiology. The canister cracked open and a spider unlike any other bit him before dissolving into his bloodstream.

His body convulsed. His mind fractured. But he lived.

Oscorp declared that only four of the ten students survived, the rest “tragically deceased.” In truth, those survivors were taken for further experimentation.
They would become the next generation of soldiers — Octopus. Vulture. Rhino. Scorpion. Sandman. Electro.

Theron escaped before they could take him, his DNA permanently rewritten. The spider’s logic merged with his own cold intellect, giving birth to something new — a predator who weaves webs not of silk, but of strategy and vengeance.

1o333kz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o333kz,Meet the Crimson Spider,"Theron Kaine grew up learning how to survive on his own, in silence.

His mother, a well known lawyer, was always in court, too busy defending the guilty to notice the son she was slowly losing. His father, Dr. Elias Kaine, a lead scientist at Oscorp, was more obsessed with his research than with family dinners. That left Theron to raise himself. a boy molded by neglect, discipline, and intellect.

He became the kind of student teachers whispered about, an academic prodigy with a cold stare. A natural athlete, yet detached from every social circle. The kind of brilliance that made others uncomfortable.

When Oscorp opened its doors to a select group of ten exceptional students, Theron was at the top of the list. It was supposed to be a reward — a glimpse into the future of science. Instead, it became the day his life burned to ash.

Behind the pristine walls and green glass labs, Dr. Kaine had discovered something monstrous: the SOLDIER program, a secret Oscorp project to create bio enhanced super soldiers using hybridized DNA — human and animal. When he tried to expose them, Norman Osborn silenced him the only way he knew how: by turning him into an experiment.

When Theron arrived for the tour, his father was no longer human. The serum had torn his mind apart, leaving only primal instinct and rage. The Lizard was unleashed. The lab erupted into chaos. Screams, alarms, fire. Students fled but the Lizard tore through steel and bone alike.

Theron was left broken and bleeding under the wreckage, his father’s roars echoing through the shattered glass halls.
In desperation, he crawled into a containment wing marked SOLDIER: SPIDER — a prototype program meant to blend arachnid adaptability with human physiology. The canister cracked open and a spider unlike any other bit him before dissolving into his bloodstream.

His body convulsed. His mind fractured. But he lived.

Oscorp declared that only four of the ten students survived, the rest “tragically deceased.” In truth, those survivors were taken for further experimentation.
They would become the next generation of soldiers — Octopus. Vulture. Rhino. Scorpion. Sandman. Electro.

Theron escaped before they could take him, his DNA permanently rewritten. The spider’s logic merged with his own cold intellect, giving birth to something new — a predator who weaves webs not of silk, but of strategy and vengeance.

I woke to the taste of rust and rot.  
 Rain slammed through the tarp above me, soaking me to the bone, and the stench of piss, oil, and something sweeter clung to my tongue—blood, old and fermented.

My left arm.  
 I froze. It wasn’t gone—not entirely—but it wasn’t mine either. Purple and black threads stitched it together, crude and uneven, the work of someone desperate or deranged. It twitched when I willed it to move, but it felt alive, almost watching me.

I coughed, breath rattling out like sandpaper. The alley was empty, but that meant nothing. Night in Ink City wasn’t empty—it hunted. Every puddle was a mirror. Every neon sign was a lure.  
 Somewhere above, a melody drifted through the storm—soft, warped, like a lullaby from a broken throat. The Meat Choir, maybe. That sound crawled under my skin, sweet and wrong, pulling at the edges of my mind.

I pushed myself up. The stitches bit deep with each movement. The air tasted electric, alive. The rain carried whispers, the kind that only came out at night—movement behind dumpsters, shadows that didn’t belong to anyone. The city was breathing. Watching.

The street stretched ahead, slick with color and reflection. Even now, even this late, people moved—small groups clinging together, heads low, prey acting like it knew it was being hunted. Their eyes were hollow, their steps rehearsed. Survival choreography.

My arm twitched again, hard enough to make me flinch. It pulsed with something not entirely blood.  
 I kept walking.

A bar glowed ahead, its yellow light spilling into the wet street. Warm. Human. Dangerous. The kind of place that didn’t ask names or offer help—just noise and momentary shelter. I slipped inside.

The door moaned shut behind me. Smoke. Whiskey. Sweat. Neon fractured through the windows, painting everything in jagged streaks of pink and green. People hunched in corners, whispering over half-empty glasses, pretending the rain outside wasn’t full of teeth.

I took a seat at the far end of the bar. My left arm rested heavy on the counter, twitching beneath my sleeve. I could feel its pulse, the faint hum of something mechanical beneath skin.

Then a shadow slid into the edge of my vision.

He didn’t sit—just leaned on the counter a few stools down. Black lab coat soaked from the rain, hair plastered to his forehead, eyes sharp, assessing. He didn’t look like the rest of them. He looked like someone who *belonged* in the dark.

“You look half-dead,” he said, calm, almost casual. His voice carried a rhythm like he was used to being listened to.

I glared. “You here to kill me too?”

He smirked faintly. “Not tonight.” A pause. “Name’s Tive. I can help you. Maybe even keep you alive long enough to help me.”

He said it like a fact, not an offer.

“Why would I trust someone in a lab coat in Ink City?” I asked, keeping my voice steady.

“Because everyone else is either trying to kill you, eat you, or sell you something.” He shrugged. “I don’t lie—unless it helps. You’re lucky I like rainy nights.”

He leaned closer, his voice lowering to a whisper. “Outside, it’s hunting time. Glass-Eyed Men. Peelers. Night Hounds. The rain doesn’t slow them, and the crowds won’t save you. Stick with me if you want to survive tonight.”

I wanted to say no. I wanted to tell him to go to hell.  
 But there was something in the way he watched the street through the window—the way he seemed to *see* the predators hiding in the reflections before anyone else did.

“Fine,” I muttered. “But I’m not letting you experiment on me. Or any weird shit like that.”

He smiled then—a sharp, patient grin, the kind that knew exactly how this night was going to end.  
 “Good,” he said. “My car’s around the corner. Let’s move before they start thinking you’re food.”

He turned toward the door without looking back.  
 For a second, I stayed where I was, watching the rain blur the world outside into streaks of light and shadow. My arm twitched again, almost eager.  
 Then I followed.



CHAPTER TWO - NIGHT DRIVE



The bar’s warmth clung to my skin, but the rain outside still called.  
 Tive didn’t hesitate—just shoved through the back door into the alley, coat plastered to his back, moving like he owned every cracked brick and puddle in the city.

I followed close, shoes slapping against the wet ground. The air was heavy with ozone and rot. Somewhere far off, sirens sang, muffled beneath the downpour.

Then something *moved* in the dark.  
 A shuffle. Metal scraping concrete.

Before I could even look, Tive spun—his hand blurring beneath the coat. A massive three-barreled revolver appeared in his grip.

The shadow lunged. Too fast. Too wrong. Limbs bending where they shouldn’t.

The first shot cracked the rain in half.  
 Then came a wet *snap*—followed by a shriek that didn’t sound human.

Two more shots. Each one louder than thunder.  
 The thing hit the ground hard, black ichor spilling out across the alley, hissing where it met the rain. The smell burned my nose—like tar and blood and something *alive*.

I gagged, stepping back. “What the—what *was* that?”

“Move,” Tive barked, already walking.

I stumbled after him, slipping on the slick pavement. The black car waited under a balcony, engine purring low like a sleeping animal.

I slammed the passenger door behind me, chest pounding. “What the fuck was that thing?”

He didn’t look at me. “What do you mean? You new here or something?” His voice was flat, clinical.

“I don’t… remember much. Woke up in an alley. Dumpster. Rain. Pain.”

He nodded once. “Good. Less you remember, the safer you are. Safer for both of us.”

The car growled to life. We tore through neon-blurred streets—pink, blue, green light flickering across his calm face.

Outside, Ink City bled color into puddles.  
 Shapes twisted in the reflections, maybe shadows, maybe eyes. Something darted along a rooftop, then vanished.

Tive didn’t speak again. He drove like he knew the veins of the city—every alley, every dead end, every trap. I gripped the seat’s edge, the stitches in my arm twitching with every jolt of the road.

Alive.  
 Watching.  
 Waiting.

Finally, he turned down a narrow street that barely existed—swallowed by scaffolding and shadows. The rain thinned. The world went quiet.

He parked in front of a small, unmarked building. One light flickered above the door, buzzing like it might die any second.

“This is it,” Tive said. “Temporary safe house. Off-grid. Should keep you out of sight for the night.”

I stared at the place. “Safe” didn’t feel like the right word. The walls looked old, sagging under their own history.

Inside, the air was stale—smelled like metal and burnt coffee.  
 Tive moved automatically, removing his coat, setting down weapons: knives, syringes, strange metallic tools that didn’t look legal anywhere.

“You need rest,” he said, voice steady. “That arm of yours—it’s not just a wound. It’s something else. We’ll figure it out later. For now, stay alive.”

I sank into a couch that creaked under my weight. The rain still whispered against the windows, turning the neon outside into ghostly streaks of color.

I didn’t know what that thing in the alley was. Or what had happened to this city. Or why my arm wouldn’t stop *twitching*.

But for the first time since the dumpster, since the pain and confusion and rain—  
 I felt almost safe.

Almost.



CHAPTER THREE - NEW FRIENDS



I woke to a light I didn’t trust. Not sunlight—something harsher, slicing through the blinds in jagged lines of pale neon. My arm throbbed, stitched threads tugging at my skin like they had a mind of their own. Every breath tasted of wet concrete and old metal.

“Get up,” Tive said, leaning against the doorway, voice calm but firm. Lab coat dry now, shoulders squared, hair still damp from the rain.

I groaned, muscles stiff, head pounding. “Where…?” I croaked.

“Breakfast can wait. You need to meet the others,” he said, moving off to the living room. His tone demanded obedience, not agreement.

I stumbled forward. The floor was cold, slick with rain tracked in from outside. The living room was crowded but strangely quiet, each person absorbed in their own ritual. The rain tapped against the windows, a relentless reminder that Ink City was still hungry.

First, Raz. Tall, lean, leather jacket faded, stubble unkempt, half-empty bottle in hand. He caught my stare and grinned. “You new?” he drawled. “I’m Raz. Used to play stages, now I play for keeps.” He patted the axe head welded to a shotgun resting against the arm of the couch. “This is *The Encore*. She’s heavy, honest… beautiful.”

Next, a pale, cross-legged young man on the floor grinning ear to ear, carving into the wooden boards with a large knife, he smiled at me—wide, unsettling, almost warm. “Hey there,” he said. “I’m Guts. Don’t worry, I only cut the bad people.” The knife glinted, precise as his grin

I walked over to a small table, someone working over a mix of wires and mechanical parts, she looked up. “Name’s Celare,” she said softly. “I patch people—our people—and I patch systems. I used to be a doctor. Still am, in a way.” Her hands moved deliberately, almost like the arm wasn’t the first strange thing she'd seen.

Finally, leaning against the far wall, cowboy hat low, long black coat draped over broad shoulders, another figure didn’t look up from the rifle resting in his lap. “Linus,” he said simply. “I work best from a distance.” Fingers traced the trigger guard like it was a habit as steady as his gaze.

And Tive, standing at the edge of the room, calm, calculating, glasses catching the light. His three-barreled revolver rested on the window sill, silent but ominous.

I swallowed. My stitched arm throbbed. Celare's gaze lingered on it.

“That’s… not normal,” Celare murmured. Fingers hovered above my arm, inspecting the stitches. “This isn’t just stitched skin… it’s something else. Something alive.”

Tive crouched beside me, fingers brushing over the stitched shoulder. “I knew it. You’re… different. Special. That’s why last night… why the city didn’t finish you.” His eyes were dark, calculating, but a small, approving smile tugged at his lips.

Raz slurred,  arms around The Encore. “Looks like we’ve got ourselves a wild card,” he said, grin lazy. “Always room for another performer.”

“You're drunk again aren't you?” Linus said, still looking out the window. “When am I not?” Raz laughed while lifting a bottle to drink.

Celare’s hands were careful, examining the purple veins and rot. “I thought this was just necrosis but… it's something more, something alive.” She studied it like she's never seen anything like it. “You can get him a new arm right? Prosthetic or something?” Tive said bringing over a swivel chair to examine my closer.

 “Sure can”  Celare pulled a small toolkit closer, wires and mechanical parts mingling with the strange organic tissue. Her movements were precise, deliberate, like she had stitched people together under worse conditions.

The rain hammered the roof, neon reflections flashing across the room. Outside, Ink City waited—hungry, patient, indifferent. Inside, Celare continued to worked quietly on my arm, delicate and precise. Guts polished his knives with an almost ritual patience. Raz polished The Encore lazily, grinning at the chaos like it was a song he was about to finish. Linus watched the shadows outside, cold and deliberate, fingers brushing the triggers of his weapons. And Tive… Tive watched me like a chessboard.

I didn’t know what this arm really was. I didn’t know what it would mean for me. But Celare’s hands were steady, Raz’s grin was genuine in a way that made me want to trust him, and Tive’s eyes were sharp. For the first time in what feels like an eternity I had a family even if they were weird as shit.  


CHAPTER FOUR - GETTING STARTED



Rain had picked up during the night, turning streets into mirrors of pale light. I woke to the slow hum of the safehouse, Tive standing by the doorway, calm as ever. No words wasted on pleasantries. Just that quiet, calculated presence he carried—always watching, always weighing.

“Time to get to work,” he said, voice steady, measured. No hint of urgency, just expectation.

My arm throbbed. The stitches tugged at me like they had a mind of their own. When I flexed my fingers, the purple-black ichor slowly crawled along the prosthetic, coiling around the mechanical joints as if alive. It slithered through the gaps, threading into wires and pistons, it felt like it was syncing with my thoughts in a way that unnerved me.

“interesting” Tive thought aloud, tilting his head. His glasses caught the dim light, gleaming like small alarms. “Good, probably. We’ll see what that arm can do.”

I swallowed, flexing again. The ichor pulsed, following the shape of the prosthetic, lacing around metal and sinew, almost like it knew what I wanted before I did.

We moved through the safehouse. Tive stopped at a heavy steel door with a keypad set into the wall. He typed in a long complex code, and it hissed open.

“Y’know,” he said, finally breaking the silence, “I never got your name.”

I paused, looked at him. “Oh, uh I… think it’s Pry,” I muttered, voice rough. “I don’t remember much before the dumpster… only bright lights, incisions, and pain.”

Tive nodded slowly, as if that explained everything. “Pry,” he said. “I’ll remember that.”

The room beyond the door smelled of oil and gunmetal. Racks of weapons glinted under dim light—silenced pistols, sniper rifles, combat knives, a row of swords I could barely believe were real. Everything was organized chaos, each weapon chosen with care, every edge honed to perfection.

“You’ll need to pick what fits you,” Tive said, gesturing to the rows. “Not what you like. What fits.”

I ran my fingers along a silenced SMG, light and balanced. My arm reacted immediately, ichor crawling further up the prosthetic, feeling for the contours, syncing to the grip. Then my eyes fell on a samurai sword, sleek, precise, with a grip that seemed almost too small for my armored hand. My fingers itched.

“This,” I said, lifting both. The ichor pulsed, coiling tighter into the prosthetic like it approved. Tive nodded.

“Smart,” he said, voice calm, approving. “Speed, silence, precision. We’ll see how it works in the field.”

Outside, the night was a sheet of rain. The city smelled of wet concrete. We moved to Tive’s car, a low, black sedan that blended into the darkness. He drove slowly, tires hissing on rain-slick streets, neon reflecting in the wet windows.

“What’s the target?” I asked, keeping my voice low. The ichor in my arm throbbed, crawling closer to the surface.

“Corporate tower,” Tive said, calm, calculating. “One of the smaller fronts. Their public face is charity, but the floor below hides a lab. They hold data we need—intel on experiments, shipments, names.” His eyes never left the road. “We don’t know who’s inside yet. Could be guards, scientists, or both. We need to do this quietly.”

I adjusted the SMG, checking the silencer, feeling the ichor swirl through my prosthetic, linking to the grip. The sword hung across my back, heavy but balanced. “Quiet,” I repeated, letting the word settle. “Alright.”

We arrived at the tower. Rain pattered on the roof like tiny drums, and the puddles reflected neon advertisements in fractured colors. Tive slid out first, quiet, deliberate. I followed, each step a negotiation with wet concrete. The ichor wrapped tighter around the prosthetic, sensing, reacting, alive.

The lobby was empty—or at least, it appeared so. Rainwater dripped through the ceiling vents, and the antiseptic scent of the building mixed with wet asphalt from outside. Tive crouched behind a planter, eyes looking for guards, and cameras.

“Look. Observe. Don’t move until you know the rhythm,” he whispered. I mirrored him, letting my senses tune to the environment, letting the ichor pulse in tandem with the space.

The first guard came into view, umbrella dripping. He didn’t see me—he couldn’t. I slipped a foot forward, letting the ichor in my arm pulse, almost alive in the shadows. One motion: SMG pressed to the back of his skull, silent squeeze of the trigger, body collapsing without a sound.

Tive didn’t look at me. He simply continued scanning. “Next.”

The second guard turned just as I ducked behind a planter. A flick of the wrist, SMG to his temple, another collapse. The ichor spread slightly, tendrils brushing the weapon like it had a mind of its own, anticipating every move.

It made me almost want to throw up.

Tive’s hand rested briefly on my shoulder—just a touch, measured, acknowledging. No praise, no words. Just that calculated approval that said more than anything could.

We reached the elevator bank. Tive pressed a hidden panel, fingers sliding over a biometric lock. The door clicked open. I followed, moving into the elevator, eyes scanning every reflection in the polished steel. My arm thrummed, ichor pulling tighter around the prosthetic’s metal bones, integrating further, seeking, reacting.

When the doors opened on the corporate floors, the fluorescent light stung. Lab coats, security cameras, and the faint hum of computers filled the air. I drew the sword, sliding it into a fighting stance, while the SMG rested ready against my chest. The ichor twitched, almost anticipating the movement of the guards.

Two scientists turned the corner, surprised. Tive’s hand lifted briefly, a signal: “Do it.”

I moved. The SMG’s suppressed bark was sharp but quiet. Purple-black ichor slid along the prosthetic, moving almost like liquid shadow. One guard dropped before he even registered pain. The sword followed, swift and clean—slicing through the second threat, the ichor tracing the blade, reinforcing my grip, my strike.

Tive moved alongside me, calm, precise, dismantling cameras and doors, letting me focus on movement and timing. We weren’t just fighting—we were a machine.

A stairwell led us higher. Guards rotated on the mezzanine. The ichor pulsed, weaving into the prosthetic like tendrils of instinct, almost thinking for me. I swung the sword when one came too close, a clean strike, SMG ready for the next.

We reached the lab floor. Screens flickered, servers hummed, and a lone security officer scanned monitors. Tive whispered, “Intel is here. But you’ll need finesse.”

I didn’t answer. The ichor twined around my prosthetic, merging, responding, feeling every pulse of the room. I slipped past the cameras, SMG low, sword ready. One step—another—then a swift strike to the guard at the door. Silent. Efficient.

Tive moved to the console, fingers flying over the keyboard. “Get what we need,” he said. “Names, shipments, research. Fast. Clean. No mistakes.”

I knelt at the nearest terminal, sliding the ichor-enhanced fingers across the keyboard. The prosthetic felt like it had a mind, linking to the interface, bypassing security protocols with eerie precision. Files decrypted, copied, and stored.

A shadow moved behind me. Reflexes honed over years, weapons ready. I spun, sword slicing a clear path, SMG covering the other angle. The ichor pulsed in response, reinforcing strength, speed, precision.

Within minutes, the data was ours. Tive backed up the servers, motion sensors disabled, cameras looping footage of empty hallways. No evidence we’d been there.

We exited via the fire escape, rain lashing, neon slicing across wet metal. The city outside was alive, hungry, and indifferent. My prosthetic arm throbbed and pulsed, the ichor now fully embracing the grafted metal—part of me, part weapon, part shield.

In Tive’s car, I finally let myself breathe. He drove slow, rain hitting the windshield like a drumbeat. “Tower intel secured,” he said. “Shipments, names, experimental subjects. Tomorrow, we analyze. Tonight… we get ready for a big score.”

I ran a hand along the prosthetic, ichor pulsing in sync with my heartbeat. “Feels… alive,” I admitted.

Tive’s eyes, calm and sharp, caught mine. “Good. That’s what I want to see.” His words were precise, measured—approval without praise. Just acknowledgement, calculation, and challenge.

Outside, the rain never stopped. Neon reflections fractured in puddles like broken promises. Inside me, the ichor moved, alive and ready, intertwined with the prosthetic, intertwined with me. And I realized: this was only the beginning.

1o331nf,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeRigged/comments/1o331nf/should_you_trust_the_best_rotary_tool_dremel_8250/,Should You Trust the Best Rotary Tool Dremel 8250 Review,"Testing the Dremel 8250-5 has been quite an adventure. This cordless rotary tool is marketed as a high-performance, versatile powerhouse, and, having used it thoroughly, I can confidently say it lives up to many of its promises. Packed with advanced features like a variable speed dial, a 12V brushless motor, and compatibility with all Dremel rotary accessories, it’s a compelling option for craftsmen and DIY enthusiasts alike. However, as with any product, there are merits and quirks to delve into.

**Brushless Motor Power and Performance**

The standout feature of the Dremel 8250 is undoubtedly its brushless motor. I tested it across various tasks like cutting, sanding, and grinding, and it consistently provided smooth and powerful performance. The 20% higher power compared to Dremel’s corded 4300 model was immediately noticeable when I tackled denser materials like hardwood and metal. Whether I was cutting through thick bolts or refining the edges of a wooden frame, the tool never faltered, maintaining precise control even under pressure. The brushless technology doesn’t just enhance performance; it also promises better durability, which is something I value when investing in a premium tool like this.

**Versatility with Accessories**

As someone who likes to experiment with projects, I appreciated that the 8250 is compatible with all Dremel rotary tool accessories. Switching between cutting, sanding, and grinding tasks was effortless due to the EZ Twist Nose Cap, which eliminates the need for a wrench. From cutting ceramic tiles to sharpening my garden tools, the versatility of this rotary tool was seriously impressive. It came with five accessories including cut-off wheels and an EZ Lock Mandrel, which got me started immediately without needing to buy extras.

**[Check Dremel 8250 price on Amazon.](https://raifords.com/p/b09rkv6rqw/)**

**Battery Life and Ease of Use**

When it comes to cordless tools, battery life can either be a blessing or frustration. The Dremel 8250 packs a 12V, 3.0Ah lithium-ion battery that provided solid runtime during my testing. In fact, it lasted longer than I anticipated, allowing me to finish sanding an entire coffee table and drilling multiple small holes without needing a recharge. The 100% more runtime compared to the older 8220 model wasn’t just marketing fluff—it proved true in my daily use. Recharging it took about 95 minutes, which was quicker than expected and convenient for back-to-back tasks. The ergonomic design made it comfortable to hold for extended projects, though my wrist did get a bit tired after long grinding sessions.

**Strengths**

- Cordless design with corded-like power  
- Advanced brushless motor ensuring durability and peak performance  
- Compatible with a wide array of rotary tool accessories and attachments  
- Quick and easy accessory changes with EZ Twist Nose Cap  
- Long-lasting battery life with quick recharge  

**Negatives**

- Slightly heavier compared to older models, especially noticeable during prolonged use  
- The price might be steep for occasional hobbyists or casual users  
- Limited accessory options included in the kit  

**Competitive Options**

The rotary tool market has plenty of competition, with models from brands like Milwaukee and DeWalt offering solid alternatives. Comparing the Dremel 8250 to the Milwaukee M12 Rotary Tool, for instance, the Dremel edges out on runtime and accessory compatibility. Conversely, DeWalt’s corded DWE4887 might come out ahead in terms of raw power, but the Dremel’s cordless convenience and brushless motor make it far more versatile for on-the-go projects or those without easy access to a power outlet. The compact design and better ergonomics of the 8250 put it above many competitors, though its heavier build might deter users accustomed to lighter options. 

**Cost Efficiency**

Considering the features and performance of the Dremel 8250, it offers a compelling value for frequent users who need a reliable rotary tool for various tasks. The initial investment may feel steep, but the time saved due to its efficiency, the wide range of capabilities, and the durability due to the brushless motor justify the spending over time. Though it might be overkill for someone who only plans to use it occasionally, professionals or advanced hobbyists will likely find it worth every penny.

1o330sb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1o330sb/marriage_looks_peaceful_until_bedtime/,Marriage looks peaceful until bedtime,"I am not married, but I have seen enough couples to know that the real test of love does not happen in arguments or anniversaries. It happens in the bedroom.

Not like that. I mean bedtime.

It always starts peacefully. Two people, one bed, a movie playing softly, promises of “let’s sleep early tonight.” Then, chaos begins.

One wants the fan on full speed because “fresh air helps me dream.” The other wants silence, darkness, and zero movement. Someone’s leg is always halfway across the border. Someone steals the blanket. And someone, somehow, ends up sleeping diagonally like they paid for the entire bed.

By two in the morning, it is no longer romance. It is survival. But every morning, they wake up pretending nothing happened. The blanket thief makes coffee, the victim forgets, and peace is restored, at least until the next night.

Maybe that is what love really is. Not grand gestures, just the quiet decision to share a bed and still like each other the next morning.

Married people, be honest, is this what bedtime diplomacy looks like? 😂

1o32z2w,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypastachannel/comments/1o32z2w/never_trust_anybody/,Never Trust Anybody,"This is a warning to everybody who see's this. One day I met a man. I was at a hotel in the town I lived in and I decided to go to one of the local hotels to look for work. I took a bus to get there and when I arrived, I went to the office. The owner was an Indian man that couldn't talk. They wrote on a chalk board there is no work. I thanked them for the information and left. After I left I knocked on a door where that man was. They opened the door and said you may come in. To be clear I will not use my real name. That is to stay anonymous. Because of that I will use the name George. 

 

I asked the man what their name was. They said Aaron. I said my name is George. You seem to be quite the man Aaron because you are alone here at the hotel. This could be a dangerous place. Aaron answered I am aware of that George. But I am not concerned. We had a long conversation. Eventually I asked that man since you are that type of person would you ever consider disappearing. Also, if you do how would you use the internet and by all means avoid the dark web. After I asked that Aaron said see this coffee mug, this mug came from the dark web. After Aaron said that I felt intrigued. We had a long conversation about the dark web. I left after that and took a bus back to the area where my house was. The next day I thought about what happened. 

 

I am aware of what the dark web is. The dark web is the part of the internet you can’t get to with the general web browser. You need a TOR browser and you need to be cautious and use common sense. The dark web has illegal porn, disgusting videos, red rooms, and things you are better off never even thinking about. I considered going there again. I decided to and decided to just be cautious and aware to not do a stupid thing. I went to that hotel a few more times and had discussions with that man. One day I went there and asked Aaron if he could explain a few things. Aaron answered Yes, I would not mind. My name is Aaron. I work for a dark web agency as an agent and I am familiar with the dark web from the inside out. I have devices that can access the dark web and have seen things that you would never even imagine. I was thinking DAM. JESUS FUCKING CHRIST. What are the chances of that ever happening? I asked Aaron if we could exchange phone numbers. He agreed and I put the name Aaron in my phone and put the number below it. I left the hotel thinking be cautious and use common sense. 

 

Eventually Aaron moved out of the hotel and moved to the countryside of the area we were in. I called Aaron and asked him if we could have a few meetings. Aaron indicated yes, and texted his address and how to get there. I drove there and parked near a trailer park. I walked down the road and saw Aaron lived off grid in a mobile trailer. I knocked on the door and Aaron answered. We sat in the living room area and Aaron explained quite a few things. Aaron said I do jobs for people. It is $200 a job and the way it works is I scan the money and it is transferred into bit coins. That means $200 becomes $200 million in bitcoins. This trailer has an AI called aphes. I am the only person who can hear aphes. I own an organization called the LRA. That stands for liberation resistance army. The LRA runs the dark web that means I own and run the dark web. When I left that day I was thinking Jesus. That is mind blowing. I considered everything and decided to have Aaron do a few jobs. The thing is there are places I am banned from and I was thinking if Aaron did things to change how that place worked I wouldn’t be banned anymore. The first thing I had to do was save up cash. I set aside a few hundred dollars and I met Aaron on the street to pay him. After the first time I waited to receive a phone call. About one-week later Aaron called and said that man is no longer a part of that organization. I felt amazed. But the thing is that was just one time. 

 

I drove to the trailer park where Aaron lived a few times and paid him to do jobs. Every time I was there Aaron always said I own the LRA. There was times Aaron said there are trillions of members of the URA. We own the world. There was other times Aaron told myself I was in the militray, got shot in the abdomen and my bladder does not work because of that. As time passed, I hired Aaron to do more things. But it was never cheap. One job was $400. There was times Aaron said there is a fee you have to pay to make things stay the way they are. Later Aaron told myself I changed the name of the organization to URA because I don’t agree with Donald Trump. That stands for Umbrella resistance army. If you are a member of the URA you are a ghost. You have no identity. You don't exist in any database in the entire world. You are invincible. The thing is I believed him. I was thinking. This is amazing. This is incredible. As time passed I had Aaron do more and more jobs. The total amount I spent was unfathomable. One day I went to Aaron’s trailer again to do one last job. To make things clear when I say do a job, I mean Aaron would make a person get fired from a place, or hack into a database to amend things or do other things. That day I was there Aaron had a bag of m&m’s. I asked him why he was eating that. They are good food. Aaron answered I own Hershey. All hershey products are healthy. I will explain George. Hershey products are healthy. I eat just organic healthy food. Hershey products, are healthy, reese’s cups are just peanut butter and cocoa, soda is just flavored water, little debbie products are heathy, a u in a circle on a food label means its healthy. But the thing is Aaron was lying. Soda is just carbonated water with artificial flavoring, caffeine, and sugar, hershey products are garbage, little debbie products are garbage, a u in a circle on a food label does not mean the food is healthy. That means the food is koshered that means not made with animals or by animals. But I will get to that idea later.             I paid Aaron to do quite a few things. I was thinking the whole time this is actually happening. I’m changing the world. However, I noticed that things never changed at all. I went to the internet and saw those people still worked at those places. Rules that were there before were still there. It was as if nothing happened. Eventually Aaron moved again. He was still in the countryside but he lived at a different facility. The thing is Aaron always lived off grid. After Aaron moved that time, he moved to a landlords apartment and lived in a spare room and paid that landlord cash each month to be off grid. At about that time I received a phone call from Aaron. Aaron said Jude you need a URA ID. This ID will give you infinite power. You can drive any vehicle, you can do anything with the ID. Also when you get the ID you will receive a URA uniform, a phone, and a gun from the URA. It will be $200. I informed him that that will never happen ever again. I will purchase the gun, phone, ID, and uniform but never ever hire him to ever do a single thing ever again. I drove to Aaron’s new place and paid him for the items. I left hoping that would arrive soon. A few months passed. I called Aaron asking where the package was. He never responded. A year passed and I had had enough. I drove to where Aaron lived knocked on the door. Aaron didn’t answer but a different man answered. I asked him where is Aaron. They answered Aaron moved out. I asked them where. There answer was to a large town about 40 minutes. 

 

A few days later I did more research. I looked online and saw those people were still at those places. Nothing had changed. I decided to get to the bottom of this. There was a neighbor of Aaron’s who had a son near where I lived. I went to there house and knocked on their door. Their son answered and said what is it George. I answered I have a few questions for you. We discussed Aaron and I found out the truth while I spoke to that man’s son. I found out from the research I did and from that man’s son Aaron was a liar. All Aaron does is lie and steal from people. Aaron is not what he says he is. Aaron does not own a company that runs the dark web, Aaron was never in the military, Aaron does not own hershey, everything Aaron told myself was a lie. Every single, solitary thing. I found out Aaron had stole from myself over $4,000. That buffoon never did a single, solitary thing. Everything was a lie. There is no URA literally everything Aaron said was a lie. I found out from that man’s son that Aaron was nothing but a fat, worthless liar who lived off of SSI. Aaron received SSI because Aaron’s bladder didn’t work. 

 

I told that man’s son I will not get mad or obsess over this. I will bring Aaron to justice and retrieve that cash. A few weeks later I saw the man who had moved to where Aaron had lived in the countryside. He said George Aaron moved to Florida. He paid his mother over $900 to drive him to Florida and drive herself back here. I thanked him for the information. Wherever you are Aaron I hope you get what you deserve. I will end this now. I made a mistake. I trusted a liar and that was wrong. Aaron is a worthless piece of garbage. Everything Aaron says is a lie. Every single, solitary thing. When Aaron talks Aaron lies. I will not get mad or dwell on this. I learned and I hope this changes. Aaron is nothing but an out of shape man that lives off of SSI that does nothing but lie and steal from people. I’m aware Aaron might see this. If you see this Aaron, go to hell you liar, you thief, you monster, you bull. Thank you for listening and letting me be able to cope with this. Also always remember if a thing sounds too good to be true it is. That means it’s not true, it’s a lie, its bull, it’s evil.

I’m currently wrapping up my stint at a fine dining restaurant in Europe , where I’ve been working in the hospitality space and learning about operations, service design, and customer experience.

I’ll be returning to India in Coming weeks to start a modern café and bakehouse in Karnataka (likely Bengaluru or Davanagere). The concept blends a warm, minimalist interior with quality coffee, pastries, and bakery products.

I’m looking to connect with a like-minded pastry chef or entrepreneurial partner who shares a love for F&B and wants to build something fresh, local, and design-driven. Ideally, someone who understands the creative and operational side of cafés — or is eager to grow into that role.

The goal is to create a space that feels handcrafted and community-focused, with a scalable model for future outlets.

If this sounds interesting to you, drop a comment or DM me .

Thanks!

If a parking ticket - will it be mailed to my vehicle registration address, or left on the windshield?  
How much will the ticket be?  
What's the allowable duration before another ticket is issued - can you get multiple tickets in 1 day?  
How long before they tow?  I assume if I leave my vehicle there for a few days, I assume I'll get 1 ticket (or more tickets?) and then they'll eventually tow me.

Look, I don't like messing with apps, QR codes, etc as I'm trying to get to where I need to be, nor do I really like using my phone for financial transactions/CC.    Your opinion may differ, but I don't like installing apps, scanning QR Codes, blah blah blah - depending on the cost, I might rather just get a bill in the mail, and pay it as I sip my morning coffee.  

Feel free to share your experiences and two cents.  Also, we know there's various parking garages that are either free or you can pay with a credit card upon leaving the garage - locust street, state street, etc. - feel free to add others you know of.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

We kept it on grind 5 setting and the espresso has a decent amount of crema but I may play around with it to see if I can do better. 

The swappable hopper are excellent. You do need to either make a drink or purge the beans leftover in the grinder. What I’ve been doing is having my coffee in the morning before my husband, then when he wakes up I unlock the hopper which prompts the “make a drink or purge the beans” button. Then he has the final caffeinated coffee and I can swap over to decaf for the afternoon with no waste. 

My parents have the delonghi dynamica plus and the drinks taste exactly the same. The chute was handy for making a decaf but it just isn’t as good as with fresh beans. 

100% recommend delonghi to anyone looking to buy a machine. As a former barista, the drinks are really good and the average coffee drinker will be happy with it.

Sometimes life doesn’t let up. You’re juggling classes, work, and, somehow, you’re also supposed to have a social life. A couple of years back, I hit a wall in my sophomore year. I wasn’t failing, but I was skating close enough that I could hear the ice crack.

Let me be clear: I always thought I had to do it all myself. I was raised by a mom who believed in tackling everything head-on. But then I got three assignments in one week - one for a group project, one for a history paper, and an essay for my biology class (which still feels unfair, by the way; why essays in STEM?). I did what I always do first: I tried to power through. By the end of the first night, I was drinking cold coffee and watching the cursor blink on a blank page. That’s when a friend told me, “Why not just pay someone to do your homework sometimes? No shame in using backup.”

Here’s what happened next, what I learned, and a breakdown if you’re also sitting in the dark with too much on your plate.

# Decision Time: Why I Paid for Homework Help

Honestly? I needed to pass, but I also needed to sleep. I began searching:

* pay to write essay
* pay for an essay
* pay for college essay
* buy essays
* buy essay online

I compared options, read reviews, and worried about plagiarism and being caught. I learned this:

* Many sites promise fast, cheap work, but are sketchy. Triple-check reviews and guarantees.
* Plagiarism checks are non-negotiable - ask directly.
* Communicate your own voice and style; otherwise, a professor will know the difference.

# What Worked for Me (Actual Steps)

1. **Start Small**
   * I first tried a short essay, not something with the weight of a final.
   * Feedback was good. No one in my class noticed, and it sounded enough like me.
2. **Clarify Your Needs**
   * Want just an outline? Research? Full essay? Be specific.
   * Ask if the draft comes with the package, or final only.
3. **Pick Wisely**
   * I tried a few sites. My top three:
      * [leoessays.com](https://leoessays.com/?rt=fiEEIaYL)
      * [speedypaper.net](https://speedypaper.net/?rt=bpKLOzH2)
      * [essaymarket.net](https://essaymarket.net/?rt=2uPTaTNC)
   * Each had their perks (good communication, decent prices, flexibility on deadlines).
4. **Fess Up to Yourself (Why Are You Buying Help?)**
   * It's not about being lazy - it’s about needing breathing room.
   * Sometimes you just need to hit submit and know it’s taken care of for once.

# Comparing Sites: Quick Breakdown

|Platform|Price Range|Edits Allowed|Plagiarism Guarantee|Notable Perk|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|leoessays.com|Mid-high|3 Free Revisions|Yes|Clear outline option|
|speedypaper.net|Mid-high|3 Free Revisions|Yes|Very fast responses|
|essaymarket.net|Varies|3 Free Revisions|Varies|Marketplace, so you choose|
|writepaperfor.me|Medium|3 Free Revisions|Yes|Clean, easy interface|

They all passed the plagiarism test - never risk that, because you’re not just buying an essay, you’re buying peace of mind. If you want a discount on your first try, a lot of these sites offer codes if you sign up by email or dig around the home page. I got 15% off on my first order, and I checked out [writepaperfor.me](https://write-paper-for-me.online/?rt=9DCYN3Zk) because the layout was less overwhelming than some others.

# Top Mistakes to Avoid When You Pay for Essay Writing

* Don’t wait until the night before - rush orders are not your friend
* Never skip on checking for feedback/reputation
* Make sure the service lets you request changes
* Copy-paste is a red flag; ask for sources and originality proofs
* Don’t use these services as a crutch for every single class (you want to actually learn something)

# My Mini-Stories: Three Times, Three Outcomes

1. **Biology Essay (C+)**
   * Used a service to buy an essay online because I just didn’t get the assignment. It wasn’t my best work, but it got me through.
2. **History Paper (B+)**
   * Paid for an essay on a topic I liked, but had no time. The writer matched my style - totally blended into my other submissions.
3. **College Entrance Essay (A-)**
   * For my roommate: she tried to buy college essay help from a different brand that’s not on my list. The results were generic and less useful. I told her to go with LeoEssays for edits, and her essay was much sharper.

# Why This Worked for Me

Paying for homework support gave me space to breathe. It’s a way to catch up, not check out. I learned to balance when I needed to study versus when I needed to just submit. I also learned more by reading the essays than writing exhausted nonsense at 2am.

If you’re considering this, approach it thoughtfully:

* Start small; test the service with a draft
* Communicate your needs (topic, outline, formatting, citations style)
* Make sure it’s plagiarism-free
* Use these for help in a crunch, not a habit

I know it’s not for everyone. But sometimes, you need to build yourself a little bridge over the chaos. Thoughtful homework help is just that - a bridge, not a shortcut. And if it buys you a few nights of sleep or lets you show up to a friend’s birthday, maybe that’s worth it.",1,1760107451.0,BrainBoostHub,0,1.0,False

NOTES: This roast has definitely been the best one so far but the notes are slightly bitter/a little flat/ not super velvety and the fruit is there but only mildly.

I tried to keep my charge temp at 378F but I can’t seem to stabilize it at the beginning, is there something wrong with my settings on artisan? The RoR curve is wonky too. Sorry for the incredibly small font, artisan was not allowing me to zoom in. TIA!!",0,1760107435.0,roasting,3,0.33,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

And yes, they’re right it is very cheap (compared to where I’m from). But to me that’s exactly why it’s dangerous, you don’t realise how much you’re spending until it’s too late.

When I went last time, I didn’t spend my money on 5-star hotels or crazy clubs. I wasn’t buying designer crap or going wild every night. I just kept buying small, “cheap” things all day, and before I knew it, I’d burned through thousands of baht and couldn’t even remember what I’d bought.

It’s the small things like 7/11 trips, tuk tuks and taxis, going into local coffeeshops and spending 400baht on coffee and cakes thinking it’s cheaper than where I’m from, basic mid range western food. 

None of it felt expensive in the moment. Every time it was just like “oh, that’s cheap.”
But at the end of the day I’d check my wallet or bank balance and think, how the hell have I spent 6,000 baht today?

And to me that’s the Thailand trap. Nothing is expensive on its own, but you’re constantly surrounded by things that tempt you to spend a little bit. And you do. Over and over again.

Thailand is cheap if you treat it like you live there.
But if you treat every purchase like “it’s only a few quid,” the country will slowly empty your wallet while you smile through it.

I’m a self-aware coffee snob, and I’ve been hanging onto my Nespresso—not because I love it, but because I refuse to buy any espresso machine under $1,000… yet I also never pull the trigger on anything over $1,000. So I just sit here, drinking “barely acceptable” espresso pods while scrolling reviews like a maniac.

Here’s what I actually need:

	•	I don’t care about milk frothing — it’s straight espresso or maybe a short americano in this house.

	•	I love the ritual and nerdy side of coffee, so something like a Flair 58 sounds tempting.

	•	But I’m also making a 5am double shot every morning for my wife… so going full-manual every day might get old fast.

	•	Current grinder: Baratza Encore for pour-overs. Probably not good enough for espresso, so I’ll likely need to upgrade. If that pushes my budget to $1,200, I can live with it.

So… do I go all-in on the Flair 58 + grinder? Or is there a better no-nonsense, high-quality espresso setup under $1K that won’t make me regret skipping the “real deal”?

As the air turns crisp and fall foliage paints the landscape, it's time for brands to embrace the magic of the season's most popular drink: the pumpkin spice latte (PSL). Starbucks has turned this seasonal favorite into a masterpiece of marketing strategy, and it can offer invaluable insights to any business looking to make a splash during these months.

### Why Pumpkin Spice Works
The pumpkin spice latte isn't just a drink; it's a cultural phenomenon, thanks to effective **sensory marketing tactics** that invoke feelings of nostalgia. Think about it: the blend of cinnamon, nutmeg, and clove doesn’t just taste good; it transports customers to cozy autumn memories. By tapping into **nostalgia-driven branding**, your campaign can resonate deeply with customers, fostering emotional connections.

### Seasonal Marketing Campaigns
Starbucks masterfully employs **limited-time offer marketing**. They release the PSL just as fall rolls in, creating a sense of urgency and excitement that drives customers into stores. This concept can work for any business — crafting seasonal campaigns that launch around holidays or trends can help capture attention and increase sales.

### Engage with Social Media
To enhance your outreach, leverage **pumpkin spice latte social media** strategies. User-generated content is a powerful tool. Encourage your customers to share their PSL experiences, tagging your brand in their posts. This not only creates community but can lead to **viral product launches** as their content circulates among their friends and followers.

Utilize platforms like Instagram with beautiful visuals of your offerings. Seasonal drinks could be showcased with capturing **reel-format stock videos** that highlight the enticing details of their preparation. Pairing this content with **hooks, CTAs, and catchy captions** can significantly increase engagement, drawing in your audience even more.

### The Next Steps
Whether you sell coffee or cosmetics, it's essential to stay on top of **fall beverage trends** and align your product strategies accordingly. Check out resources available at www.thebusinessbench.com to find exclusive templates, checklists, and content prompts specifically designed to help your branding flourish in this seasonal tide. 

Remember, while the allure of a pumpkin spice marketing strategy is potent, execution requires genuine effort. The journey will be challenging, and results depend on you but don’t shy away from strategies that can elevate your brand this fall.

My bf at the time who we will call B 16M and me 17f went to the same school and while I was a junior and he was a sophomore he seemed truly sweet and ATM I was into country guys....he fit that perfectly as I am a southern girl myself my mom is from Texas and my dad from Tennessee and though I was born and raised in good Ole Michigan....you wouldn't be able to guess it. 

Anyways back to the situation, in our friend group there was 2 of his exs one we will call D 16f and the other we will call L 18f. I was friends with L...to an extent and had been for going on 4 years though D I knew nothing about. Before dating him I had no idea that L had been with him as he was a small fling and they're relationship didn't last ling.......she cheated with his best friend which was another reason her and I had always been a bit distance friend wise as I knew to an extent she wasn't to be trusted. When finding this out tho into our relationship I had already build trust with him so it was all good but I knew to keep her at a distance of us and our relationship and he understood this as well. With F though I didn't know too much but she was known for being a bad stealer and though I gave her the Benefit of the doubt, there were several times I watch her try to flirt with B in which he would ignore her or walk away once he realized what she was doing. With being in the same friend ground though there was an extent that they would be ther wand even if distanced not completely cut out would they be. 


For context though within the first week when we were dating 2 girls went up to me and said he asked for nudes. While many of you may say that was a clear sign he was cheating and I was stupid for cutting it off there. I had never been Ina proper relationship and before then my first one lasted a month and he broke uo with my on valentine's day. As well as one of the girls who told me had liked him and started drama with me through text which I had blocked her cuz what even. She had said I stole him from her and when I asked her for proof that he asked she said she didn't have any and further more couldn't even show me proof she had him added....mine you this will make sense later why not. 

Fast forward to 6 month in our relationship and I thought we had guild something great. During this we had made memories and he had come over for my birthday ( mind you when we first started dating he was 15 and I was 16) so it was ,y 17th and he had surprised me at my house when I opened my bedroom door with gifts and a hug. A week before mine it had been his as my day  is on 13th of December while his is the 4th of December and we had gone bowling. Originally he asnt able to go as there was a family get together planned and it would be family he never gets to see as they live in Tennessee and though I was sad, I understood. Back to the end of the 6 months though, I was at church my B's little sister 14f, L and 2 of my other friends. I enjoyed hanging out with them all and I had gotten close to B's sister, it ws like she was my own. While chilling outside the sanctuary as we have a coffee shop in our church as well as a lounge spot where you can listen from outside, L had gotten a reply to her story from B and it was where you send emoji to describe how you feel about the person who puts it up. B had put the emoji that said he thought she was pretty. L showed me as I had been sitting next to her and was watching something with her anyways on her phone. At first she acted all shocked but I felt a weird feeling....like it wasn't the first time it happened but I had no proof and wanted to believe I was overthinking. 

Later when B came to church I had a one on one condo with him and told him how it made me uncomfortable and that I understand if maybe he didn't see how that isn't okay but that he is in a relationship with me and going out of ur way to do that towards another females gives the wrong impression and especially not an ex. He understood and had apologized but after that I felt myself grow distant as I was trying to build the trust again but it was extremely hard. I've always have problems with people breaking my trust so for that to happen it made ti so much worse as I thought I could trust him with it all. 

Going into  month 8 we had moved on somewhat and though I kept having the distrust to an extent I was pushing to make it better. One day I give him ym Snapchat account as one of my other friends said it would build trust and is like a mile stone, I've never heard of that but did it and said I just wanted to show him how muchi am all in for our relationship. He said thank you and that it meant alot but also that he can't sign out of his account as it had a bug and wouldn't let him back in as it happened in the passed and he had to make a whole new account. I trusted him and more so said maybe i could help which he declined and a I'd it was okay. I asked him if that meant I couldn't go on his account and he said no as it would sign him out on his phone and I said I was sorry for the inconvenience in the account but asked if I could use his phone ever to at least take photos of us together at school. He said it ws fine and I had done so, I never thought to go and sign out....though later I would wish I had. 

A week before valentine's day B and a few of our friends including L were going Togo to the bowling alley as we all enjoyed it and it was also where his bowling team was at so he could also practice. I was originally go but found out later I had family event but when it wax canceled I told him I would be able to come along and how I couldn't wait to see him there. When he opened the message, he left my on read and as I waited I went through people's stories. On L's story she had posted couple goals and on it was B driving a cart in Walmart with her in it while his best friend...the she cheated on him with was driving his gf. I was shocked and told him I wasn't comfortable with this and further more that I wasn't okay doing it behind my back. He said it wasn't like that and that he just didn't want drama which I replied with no he just didn't want to get caught. 

After such he said L was spending the night with his little sister....whichnis a bit odd cuz she doesn't rlly like her an further more during this I was otp with her and she said L was in his room. Her, B and his best friend were goofing off doing dumb s*** ig. I messaged him that there wS no way he was really gonna not tell me and that it want okay....he messaged back that we needed a break. For some r3ason I let it fly that night and I guess I was just trying to fight for the relationship...even though deep down I knew there wasn't anything to fight. The next fay I told him I was done and if he xouldnt respect my boundaries it is clear he also wasn't actually looking for a real one at least not a committed one. He said he was sorry and said don't go which I replied that I would put his goodies in his locker. I should have kept them...could have at least sold them and gotten something out of that relationship as the next week would be he'll. 

The following Monday as I walked into school I was trying to keep it together as I put his hoodies in his locker, D walked up to me and hugged me in which I broke down. I've never been the person to cry and non of my friends had ever seen my shed a tear, not once so for me to do so was...definitely a sign I was not okay 😅
She told me she was passed at Band further more would kick his a**. She also told me that another one of our friends had sent to and with him that night before...we will called her M 15f. I knew her and was not close but meverthoyght much as she liked a different guy in the group. When finding that out it just broke me more. Later that day m told me was sorry and her excuse was she ws cross faded as well as B....doesn't make it right though...clearly. she apologized but I wasn't even there, it was numbness at that point. Further more another girl we will call K 14f told me that he had asked her for nudes but she said no and later found out we had been dating....she didn't tell me though cuz she thought I seemed happy and she didn't wanna be the one to ruin it. When she showed me the chats...that's when it got worse. 

He had another account and even more so everyone knew about it except me and again they're  e cases were that they saw me happy and have never seen me that much...didn't wanna ruin it. Context to this I had asked everyone at lunch if they knew about it and I got...silence before any if them finally responded. I also found out K had access to this account and had gone on it to SOS times do his streaks ""yay such a good friend ☠️"". She went on it with me ans there were about 38 girls on it and even worse....I found D and L on there and read the not okay chats. There was also abt 10 other girls from my school and who I had several classes with who had congratulations our relationship and said how cute we had been at the winter dance together. I didn't know what to do except feel betrayed, all my friends or so I thought had keoted it from me saying how it was to keep me safe but in turn just made it worse.  

When confronting him he said he did it also cuz I wouldn't have s** with him as I told him I wanted to wait till we had been dating for at least 10 months as I wanted to make sure he as in it for the long hall and also in general told him I just wanted to feel comfortable and it to be meanignful when we did reach that step bht because io he is a dude and i guess to an extent feelinf like maybe it wasnt fair on him when or if he ever asked for nudes from me I would sometimes say yes but kept my face out of view...when I said no though I found out he would go on the other account to get nudes saying it was only I wasn't a good gf to him. BecUae of all of thianhe said he needed to have s** and it wasn't fair me making him wait, mind you when we had spoken about it he was fine and said it was perfectly okay and he respected me for setting those boundaries. Mind you all of this happened in one week so yeah yikes.

By that Friday though all of them were bulling me and ,making fun of me for being ""so stupid and pathetic"" and saying how could I have thought he would ever love me. I was done and within the following 2 weeks my grades I fallen off, I was failing everything, kept skipping class as during it all I was breaking down and was in all honestly getting high off my mind just to numb the emotions. By the 3rd I left the school and went to an online school as i couldn't stand the constant bullying and put downs for people I used to call friends. As well as the second week B had started dating D and more so had gone to the valentine's dance with one another. 

The months to follow were full of helplessness and them making fake account or TikToka putting me down and shaming me for not having s** with him as well as not knowing how he wa cheating. I couldn't wrap my head around ti as there were  so, any good memories and it sounds sad but even going into shops like Walmart I broke down as he ahd gone shopping with me and my family just to have time with me but now everything seemed ranted that I did.....even going to church. 


3 years later though my mental health is so much better, I graduated that year early... whole year early despite the things that happened. I am engaged to my handsome English man and though we are long distance e we are ,voing into our apartment coming early next year and getting married in July of next as well. He has been truly the kindest caring, an ever and has stood by me throughout some many things and during each and ever visit just melted me along with his family as his 2 little brothers are th sweetest ever.

1o32m9r,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1o32m9r/never_trust_anybody/,Never Trust AnyBody,"This is a warning to everybody who see's this. One day I met a man. I was at a hotel in the town I lived in and I decided to go to one of the local hotels to look for work. I took a bus to get there and when I arrived, I went to the office. The owner was an Indian man that couldn't talk. They wrote on a chalk board there is no work. I thanked them for the information and left. After I left I knocked on a door where that man was. They opened the door and said you may come in. To be clear I will not use my real name. That is to stay anonymous. Because of that I will use the name George. 

 

I asked the man what their name was. They said Aaron. I said my name is George. You seem to be quite the man Aaron because you are alone here at the hotel. This could be a dangerous place. Aaron answered I am aware of that George. But I am not concerned. We had a long conversation. Eventually I asked that man since you are that type of person would you ever consider disappearing. Also, if you do how would you use the internet and by all means avoid the dark web. After I asked that Aaron said see this coffee mug, this mug came from the dark web. After Aaron said that I felt intrigued. We had a long conversation about the dark web. I left after that and took a bus back to the area where my house was. The next day I thought about what happened. 

 

I am aware of what the dark web is. The dark web is the part of the internet you can’t get to with the general web browser. You need a TOR browser and you need to be cautious and use common sense. The dark web has illegal porn, disgusting videos, red rooms, and things you are better off never even thinking about. I considered going there again. I decided to and decided to just be cautious and aware to not do a stupid thing. I went to that hotel a few more times and had discussions with that man. One day I went there and asked Aaron if he could explain a few things. Aaron answered Yes, I would not mind. My name is Aaron. I work for a dark web agency as an agent and I am familiar with the dark web from the inside out. I have devices that can access the dark web and have seen things that you would never even imagine. I was thinking DAM. JESUS FUCKING CHRIST. What are the chances of that ever happening? I asked Aaron if we could exchange phone numbers. He agreed and I put the name Aaron in my phone and put the number below it. I left the hotel thinking be cautious and use common sense. 

 

Eventually Aaron moved out of the hotel and moved to the countryside of the area we were in. I called Aaron and asked him if we could have a few meetings. Aaron indicated yes, and texted his address and how to get there. I drove there and parked near a trailer park. I walked down the road and saw Aaron lived off grid in a mobile trailer. I knocked on the door and Aaron answered. We sat in the living room area and Aaron explained quite a few things. Aaron said I do jobs for people. It is $200 a job and the way it works is I scan the money and it is transferred into bit coins. That means $200 becomes $200 million in bitcoins. This trailer has an AI called aphes. I am the only person who can hear aphes. I own an organization called the LRA. That stands for liberation resistance army. The LRA runs the dark web that means I own and run the dark web. When I left that day I was thinking Jesus. That is mind blowing. I considered everything and decided to have Aaron do a few jobs. The thing is there are places I am banned from and I was thinking if Aaron did things to change how that place worked I wouldn’t be banned anymore. The first thing I had to do was save up cash. I set aside a few hundred dollars and I met Aaron on the street to pay him. After the first time I waited to receive a phone call. About one-week later Aaron called and said that man is no longer a part of that organization. I felt amazed. But the thing is that was just one time. 

 

I drove to the trailer park where Aaron lived a few times and paid him to do jobs. Every time I was there Aaron always said I own the LRA. There was times Aaron said there are trillions of members of the URA. We own the world. There was other times Aaron told myself I was in the militray, got shot in the abdomen and my bladder does not work because of that. As time passed, I hired Aaron to do more things. But it was never cheap. One job was $400. There was times Aaron said there is a fee you have to pay to make things stay the way they are. Later Aaron told myself I changed the name of the organization to URA because I don’t agree with Donald Trump. That stands for Umbrella resistance army. If you are a member of the URA you are a ghost. You have no identity. You don't exist in any database in the entire world. You are invincible. The thing is I believed him. I was thinking. This is amazing. This is incredible. As time passed I had Aaron do more and more jobs. The total amount I spent was unfathomable. One day I went to Aaron’s trailer again to do one last job. To make things clear when I say do a job, I mean Aaron would make a person get fired from a place, or hack into a database to amend things or do other things. That day I was there Aaron had a bag of m&m’s. I asked him why he was eating that. They are good food. Aaron answered I own Hershey. All hershey products are healthy. I will explain George. Hershey products are healthy. I eat just organic healthy food. Hershey products, are healthy, reese’s cups are just peanut butter and cocoa, soda is just flavored water, little debbie products are heathy, a u in a circle on a food label means its healthy. But the thing is Aaron was lying. Soda is just carbonated water with artificial flavoring, caffeine, and sugar, hershey products are garbage, little debbie products are garbage, a u in a circle on a food label does not mean the food is healthy. That means the food is koshered that means not made with animals or by animals. But I will get to that idea later.             I paid Aaron to do quite a few things. I was thinking the whole time this is actually happening. I’m changing the world. However, I noticed that things never changed at all. I went to the internet and saw those people still worked at those places. Rules that were there before were still there. It was as if nothing happened. Eventually Aaron moved again. He was still in the countryside but he lived at a different facility. The thing is Aaron always lived off grid. After Aaron moved that time, he moved to a landlords apartment and lived in a spare room and paid that landlord cash each month to be off grid. At about that time I received a phone call from Aaron. Aaron said Jude you need a URA ID. This ID will give you infinite power. You can drive any vehicle, you can do anything with the ID. Also when you get the ID you will receive a URA uniform, a phone, and a gun from the URA. It will be $200. I informed him that that will never happen ever again. I will purchase the gun, phone, ID, and uniform but never ever hire him to ever do a single thing ever again. I drove to Aaron’s new place and paid him for the items. I left hoping that would arrive soon. A few months passed. I called Aaron asking where the package was. He never responded. A year passed and I had had enough. I drove to where Aaron lived knocked on the door. Aaron didn’t answer but a different man answered. I asked him where is Aaron. They answered Aaron moved out. I asked them where. There answer was to a large town about 40 minutes. 

 

A few days later I did more research. I looked online and saw those people were still at those places. Nothing had changed. I decided to get to the bottom of this. There was a neighbor of Aaron’s who had a son near where I lived. I went to there house and knocked on their door. Their son answered and said what is it George. I answered I have a few questions for you. We discussed Aaron and I found out the truth while I spoke to that man’s son. I found out from the research I did and from that man’s son Aaron was a liar. All Aaron does is lie and steal from people. Aaron is not what he says he is. Aaron does not own a company that runs the dark web, Aaron was never in the military, Aaron does not own hershey, everything Aaron told myself was a lie. Every single, solitary thing. I found out Aaron had stole from myself over $4,000. That buffoon never did a single, solitary thing. Everything was a lie. There is no URA literally everything Aaron said was a lie. I found out from that man’s son that Aaron was nothing but a fat, worthless liar who lived off of SSI. Aaron received SSI because Aaron’s bladder didn’t work. 

 

I told that man’s son I will not get mad or obsess over this. I will bring Aaron to justice and retrieve that cash. A few weeks later I saw the man who had moved to where Aaron had lived in the countryside. He said George Aaron moved to Florida. He paid his mother over $900 to drive him to Florida and drive herself back here. I thanked him for the information. Wherever you are Aaron I hope you get what you deserve. I will end this now. I made a mistake. I trusted a liar and that was wrong. Aaron is a worthless piece of garbage. Everything Aaron says is a lie. Every single, solitary thing. When Aaron talks Aaron lies. I will not get mad or dwell on this. I learned and I hope this changes. Aaron is nothing but an out of shape man that lives off of SSI that does nothing but lie and steal from people. I’m aware Aaron might see this. If you see this Aaron, go to hell you liar, you thief, you monster, you bull. Thank you for listening and letting me be able to cope with this. Also always remember if a thing sounds too good to be true it is. That means it’s not true, it’s a lie, its bull, it’s evil. Never ever do that at any time for any reason imaginable.",1,1760106931.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

I’m  currently wrapping up my stint at a fine dining restaurant in Europe , where I’ve been working in the hospitality space and learning about operations, service design, and customer experience.

I’ll be returning to India in Coming weeks  to start a modern café and bakehouse in Karnataka (likely Bengaluru or Davanagere). The concept blends a warm, minimalist interior with quality coffee, pastries, and bakery products.

I’m looking to connect with a like-minded pastry chef or entrepreneurial partner who shares a love for F&B and wants to build something fresh, local, and design-driven. Ideally, someone who understands the creative and operational side of cafés — or is eager to grow into that role.

The goal is to create a space that feels handcrafted and community-focused, with a scalable model for future outlets.

If this sounds interesting to you, drop a comment or DM me .

1o32lc6,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1o32lc6/rainy_dayz/,Rainy Dayz,"Ray stood on the corner of 145th and Lenox, hoodie soaked, eyes low. Rain hit the pavement like snare drums, tapping out a rhythm only the broken could hear. He had twenty-three years behind him, most of them spent dodging systems—school, cops, family, fate. He wasn’t dumb. Just tired. Tired of being smart in a world that paid in pain.

The block was quiet, except for the hiss of tires and the occasional cough of a passing soul. Ray lit a Newport with hands that shook like loose wires. He’d been up three nights straight, chasing a plan that kept slipping through his fingers like wet dice.

He used to dream in color. Now it was grayscale—concrete, steel, and the ghost of his brother Tone, who got caught in a sweep two summers back. Tone had vision. Ray had survival. That was the difference. Tone painted futures in rhyme. Ray patched holes in the present.

He ducked into the bodega, nodding at Mr. Singh, who never asked questions. Ray grabbed a coffee, black, no sugar. Bitterness kept him sharp. Outside, the rain hadn’t let up. It was the kind of storm that made the city feel honest. No filters. Just wet truth.

He walked past the mural of Malcolm X, faded but still watching. Ray felt the weight of legacy pressing down on him like wet denim. He wasn’t trying to be a martyr. Just a man. But even that felt like a stretch some days.

At the laundromat, he spotted Keisha folding baby clothes. Her eyes met his, and for a second, the rain stopped. Not outside—inside. She had that effect. She used to call him “Professor” back when he’d break down biology metaphors in the stairwell, comparing cell walls to prison bars, DNA to destiny. She said he made science sound like scripture.

“You still writing?” she asked, voice soft like vinyl static.

“Nah,” Ray said. “Just surviving.”

She nodded, like she understood too well. “Survival’s a story too.”

Ray left before the silence got heavy. He walked aimlessly, letting the rain baptize him. Somewhere between 138th and reality, he ducked into the community center. Miss Laverne was still holding court, teaching kids how to code and how to dream.

“Raymond,” she said, like his name was a promise. “You ready to stop running?”

He didn’t answer. Just stared at the chalkboard, where someone had written: “Rainy days ain’t forever. But they teach you how to walk.”

That night, Ray sat in his room, pen in hand, notebook open. He wrote like the rain was watching. He wrote about Tone, about Keisha, about the block and the blood and the biology of pain. He wrote about how trauma replicates like cancer, but so does hope. He wrote until the sun cracked the sky open like a secret.

Ray wasn’t fixed. But he was moving. ",1,1760106867.0,stories,1,1.0,False

Looking for other comps I should be reading too. I'm also debating whether to call this ""paranormal romance"" or ""rom-com""... The first 300 words are posted below. Any feedback is appreciated! Thanks. 

\---

I am seeking representation for my debut paranormal romance, THE FULL BLOOM BAKESHOP, complete at 70,000 words. It blends the comical, forced proximity romance found in Sarah Hawley’s *A Witch’s Guide To Fake Dating A Demon*, with the witchy whimsy in Sangu Mandanna’s *The Very Secret Society of Irregular Witches*, and adds a dash of *Gilmore Girls*. 

Millie DeBloom knows the first rule about being a witch: don’t let the Normies find out. So she and her mother lay low in their one-town island off the coast of New England. No one questions why her enchanted chickens lay a few more eggs than normal, or why her bakery’s coffee is the best brew in town. When she’s not subtly slipping her Normie neighbors love potions through her pastries, she’s busy preparing for the island’s summer solstice festival. She has no time to deal with nosy investigators like Agent Cartwright, no matter how good looking he is. 

Leo Cartwright, a by-the-spellbook investigator from the dreaded Bureau, is called to the island after detecting an unusually high level of magic. He’s determined to find the source before it’s discovered by a nefarious sorcerer–or worse, he’s fired. After losing his coworker in a magical accident, this assignment is his last chance to prove himself to his boss. While stopping at a coffee shop run by one of the island's two registered witches, the last thing he's expecting is to immediately fall for the scrumptious baker. 

His accidental ingestion of a love potion is incredibly inconvenient to Millie and her questionably legal activities. But she needs Leo’s help in finding her missing mother, whom the Bureau believes is responsible for the suspicious magical surge. Between beach walks, baking sessions, and searching for her mom, Millie’s feelings for him begin to rise like her croissants. But when Leo discovers the source of the surge is actually Millie’s errant sourdough starter, he begins to question what else she's hiding. Leo must decide if he’s willing to break his number one rule: don’t fall in love with a suspect. And where the heck is Millie’s mother? 

\[bio\]

\---

They say the way to someone’s heart is through their stomach. Millie DeBloom knew this fact all too well. That’s precisely why she was baking an extra batch of doughnuts at four o’clock that morning. Except one required a special ingredient. She took out the folded napkin from the pocket of her apron and set it on the metal table alongside her other ingredients. 

She fanned herself off with her prep list. The back door of the bakery was propped open with a milk crate, letting in the soft summer breeze. It must be low tide, Millie thought to herself as she scented the sulfur and saltiness in the air. No matter where you were on the island, the beach was never far as the crow flies. 

The tiny hairs that had escaped her bandana were either stuck to her sweaty forehead or standing straight up. If the delivery guy ever showed up, he would think she had been struck by lightning. 

A whisk lazily stirred the lemon curd on the stove by itself. She’d have to check on it soon or else it might curdle. Even a magic whisk couldn’t save a curd from burning. And it needed to be perfect – it was Adrian’s favorite. 

He was the island’s handyman, the guy everyone called when a pipe burst or a door needed to be adjusted when it swelled with the humidity. He was in his mid-forties with salt-and-pepper hair and a handsome, weathered face. He was also a complete grouch. 

But Millie’s lemon curd doughnuts always put a smile on his face, and she was determined that this particular doughnut would change his life. 

She slowly unfolded the napkin, careful not to let its contents blow away in the breeze. She picked up the single strand of auburn hair...

Surprisingly, the answer in most cases is NOT.

I will give one example, there was recently a post about eating beef, so I am from Brazil and I know my country is the biggest producer of cow meat in the world, I myself can't afford eating it more than once a week, I think the rural workers who are taking care of the cattle are probably in a similar situation. Brazil is also the biggest coffee producer in the world and I as a brazilian can barely afford to buy any coffee anymore, so does the rural workers who pick coffee all day. I am not talking about the farmers, but the people who work for the farmers.

The same logic applies to many different thins, often times, factory workers who produce Iphones can't afford to buy one for themselves, people who work in factory building cars can't afford to own those same cars and so on.

I’m Monica 👋 Local NP here — need your opinion on something!,"Hey neighbors! I’m Monica — nurse practitioner, mom, and professional coffee drinker ☕️. I run a little clinic here in town called Impact Family Wellness, where we ditched insurance (on purpose!) so we can actually spend time with patients instead of paperwork.

I wanted to say hi and also pick your brains a bit:

**If you could wave a magic wand and change one thing about going to the doctor, what would it be?**

I’m genuinely curious — I’m trying to make healthcare feel less like a chore and more like a partnership, and your feedback helps a ton.

Also open to any favorite coffee spots or hidden gems — I’m always up for discovering new local favorites! 😄

I keep going back cause I’m still human that needs social interaction and the coffee is really good but maybe it’s stressing me more than anything.

I’ve come across a deal on a Lelit Bianca V3 - 3400CAD (~2400USD). Regular advertised price is around 4300CAD. I’ve read elsewhere that European prices are around 2000USD and that’s quite competitive vs other dual boiler machines. Other machines in the price range in Canada currently are Profitec Drive, ECM mechanika, Bezerra Duo, Breville Oracle Touch, Rancillio Silvia Pro X. 

We’ve had a Breville Barista Pro for ~3.5 years and recently upgraded to a stand alone grinder which has really improved our coffee. We do minimum of 2 double shot drinks per day, mostly milk based (cappuccino or flat white for me, iced coffee for my wife). Therefore my typical morning workflow involves two shots and steaming milk back to back. I enjoy a good light/medium roast my wife is less picky. 

We were considering getting a Jura as an upgrade but after trying the coffee at the store and at a friends I realized my Breville was producing better coffee at a fraction of the price. 

Appreciate thoughts on whether this is a good deal relative to other options and experience from owners. Should I pull the trigger or wait and see what Black Friday brings? ",3,1760106265.0,espresso,2,0.81,False

I’m looking for a genuine, fun, and confident female friend who doesn’t take life too seriously. Someone who enjoys good conversations, likes to hang out, and understands basic male-female dynamics would be perfect.

I already have plenty of male friends, but I don’t have many female friends these days mostly because of my work-from-home job. That doesn’t mean I’ve lost touch with women, just that interactions have become limited. I’m not looking for a relationship, a fling, or any kind of “situationship.” I just want to connect with a cool person who can challenge me, teach me something new, and learn from me too.

If you’re just looking to waste time, scroll past this post. I’m not interested in games, drama, or “time-pass” chats. I’d much rather connect with someone from Nagpur, but if you’re from another city, that’s fine (just know I already have friends outside Nagpur). We can start with texts and, if we vibe, meet up for coffee, a movie, or a spontaneous trip the kind you wouldn’t tell your parents about. We’ll always split the bills, and I’ve got a car and a bike for exploring anywhere in the city or for quick getaways. That’s just part of the adventure, not a flex.

Also, if you’re the type who just doom-scrolls, binge-watches Netflix, and doesn’t do anything interesting, this probably isn’t for you. Share something real about yourself tell me something unique or intriguing that might actually make me curious to know you better.

I’m not here to make a dozen efforts to win your heart, and I’m definitely not putting anyone on a pedestal. I respect independent women and expect the same in return. If you’re looking for a boyfriend, a caretaker, or a future husband, you’re in the wrong place.

I’m just a chill, good-looking, and adventurous guy open to new experiences, places, and genuine connections. If you relate to any of this, drop a comment or a DM, and I’ll reach out.

If you think I am gonna pay your bills and I expect some physical connection and provide everything you're barking at the wrong gate there are already those types of women who are in my dms.",0,1760106224.0,nagpur,11,0.1,False

I made this for the Great Jones Manhattan competition last month. Didn’t place but I felt like it was a good showing so I’m bringing it here.

2oz Infused and Washed Great Jones Straight Rye Whiskey* 
0.5oz Byrrh Grand Quinaquina Aperitif 
0.5oz Carpano Antica Formula Sweet Vermouth 
.25oz Giffard Frais de Bois Liqueur 
2 Dashes Regan's Orange Bitters 
3 Dashes Angostura Bitters 
Absinthe Rinse

I did a toasted rye bread infusion for the rye, doubling down on the spice, caraway, and pepper you get from the whiskey and bringing it more forward. Washed that with milk cause honestly Great Jones doesn’t make the easiest drinking rye and it softened it up a bit. I split the aromatized wine component with Byrrh which leaned into the red fruit characteristic I was looking for and complimented that with the strawberry liqueur. The absinthe was a late addition to bring out more caraway and anise that finished really pleasantly in the glass. It was balanced, complex, and delightfully spicy and herbal. Alas, we’ll get ‘em next time (probably won’t, but you won’t win if you don’t try).

* To make the Whiskey infusion: combine 1 part by weight Toasted Rye Bread Crumbs or Pieces with 4 parts Great Jones Rye and allow to steep for 2 hours, then add 20% by weight of milk and let sit under refrigeration for 2 more hours before filtering through coffee filter for clarification/texture.",4,1760106186.0,cocktails,0,0.83,False

I run on strong iced Americanos (more bitter, the better), and on nights I can’t sleep, I end up making some questionable but amazing food combos… like instant noodles with peanut butter. Don’t knock it till you try it.
 
I’d call myself more of a quiet romantic, not about grand gestures, but the little things that make someone feel seen and cared for. I like deep conversations, wit, a bit of playful banter, and those rare comfortable silences. Small talk isn’t really my thing, I’d much rather hear about what excites you, what keeps you up at night, or even just your random thoughts on a slow evening.

First dates for me aren’t about being flashy, I’d rather grab coffee, take a walk, or find a quiet corner with a good view where we can just talk. I’m spiritual in my own way, and while, I’m also pretty laid back about it, I believe love and kindness matter more than labels.

What I’m hoping to find is someone patient, nurturing, witty, and kind, someone who values attention, effort, and honesty. Ghosting and breadcrumbs aren’t my vibe; I’d rather build something steady, playful, and genuine, even if it takes time.

If that sounds like your pace, maybe let’s skip the surface-level chatter and actually get to know each other.

I’m the girl who hums MCR or ATL songs while brewing coffee, tears up every time Sam says, “I can’t carry it for you, but I can carry you,” and still insists Star Wars is really about love that never gives up. I will always be proud of my Hogwarts house (🐍) and my Demigod lineage (🔱)
My shelves are stacked with books, manga, and a few Pokémon save files I swear I’ll finish someday. Somewhere between all those worlds, I learned how to be happy on my own.

A little chubby, a little cheeky, glasses slightly crooked from laughing too much. I live solo, surrounded by stories, my Switch, and quiet nights that feel like end credits. I’m independent, sentimental, and hopelessly attached to fictional universes (and coffee).

I love conversations that wander from favorite anime arcs to the strange, beautiful meaning of life. My love language? Quality time, soft touches, and thoughtful little gestures that say “I see you.”

Not searching for a hero, just someone smart, witty, and nerdy enough to join the quest, trade playlists, and maybe be player two on cozy Sunday adventures.

If you think we’d vibe, send an owl or a message, it’ll be more fun if you can name your all-time favorite comfort movie/anime or Pokémon. 😌✨",1,1760106057.0,singleph,0,1.0,False

I'm a small content creator on YouTube under the same name, and I edit videos for other people as well, primarily friends of mine and streamers. When I'm not making videos for fun I work at a coffee shop. I've started playing on PC more often after switching over from Xbox. I'm relatively new to this subreddit and would love to be more active here.

I've had three pet cats in my past and I loved all of them with all my heart. I heard about this game when it came out and it looked like so much fun. I also saw this game when it was nominated for a few rewards at the Game Awards. However, when this game came out I was working a lot and couldn't find time to buy this game or play games in general. Also, I was playing on a Xbox One at the time which was slowly started to get less and less newer games. Now I play on PC primarily and have been trying to expand my library to play more amazing games that my PC can handle. I'm a small content creator who occastionally posts stuff for fun and I edit videos for other friends of mine who want to upload stuff or stream. If I get this game I may record me playing it for fun. The reason why you should gift me this game is because I would be very grateful and appreciative towards any act of charity. I'm currently in between jobs and don't really have the money to buy a lot of games so I would be so happy if someone would be able to gift me this game. Thank you for your time in reading if you made it this far, im also pretty new to this subreddit so if all goes well for me maybe I'll use it more often ^ ^ <3
