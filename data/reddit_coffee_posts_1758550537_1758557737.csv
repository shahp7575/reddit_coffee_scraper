All the ""stuff"" was removed and the area where he dripped on to was taken out.  I realize in order for it to be conpletely cleaned requires completely replacing the interior - seats, carpet, headliner, etc...

But I'm not going to do that.  I want to sell it, as it was signed over to a friend as collateral for a loan.  I have used 30% vinegar, baking soda, bleach, ammonia, fabuloso and a few other things.

What are some tips to get the smell out of this thing to help with the sale?
Any tricks or hacks when using baking soda, coffee, vinegar, airing it out, a fan?   Anything I am missing, please suggest


I would like to have this cleaned and not smelling so bad ASAP.

**TL;DR:**  
Starts with sweet fruit and cream on the pre-light, lights up with some pepper and cream, then settles into creamy coffee basically the whole ride. Smooth, tasty, and easy to smoke.

# The Cigar

The Hellas Box Pressed (Habano wrapper over Nicaraguan binder/filler) comes in a couple vitolas: the Dolos (5.5x52) and the bigger Kleos (6.8x54). Medium to medium-full bodied, nice construction, and marketed as a value stick.

# My Smoke

Pre-light sniff and cold draw gave me fruit sweetness and cream, like a fruit tart you steal from the dessert tray when nobody’s looking. First light brought pepper and cream, that quick jolt to remind you it’s a Habano. From there it leveled out into creamy coffee and just stayed consistent. Honestly, I didn’t mind the lack of big transitions because it was such a comfortable profile. Burn and draw were trouble-free, ash held steady.

# Pros / Cons

**Pros:** Solid burn, creamy coffee core, good balance of sweet → spice → smooth. Doesn’t get harsh or bitter. Great price point.  
**Cons:** If you’re looking for a powerhouse or a wild flavor journey, this isn’t it. Strength builds a bit, but it never gets past medium-full.

# Final Thoughts

The Hellas doesn’t try to be flashy; it’s a reliable medium stick that hits the sweet spot between smooth and flavorful. You get a touch of sweetness, a quick kick of pepper, and then it cruises in that creamy coffee lane all the way down. It’s consistent, well-built, and a great value when you just want a no-fuss cigar that delivers.

“What are you going to do now?” Olivia asked.

“I’m going to kill him. I’m going to kill General Constantino.”

“Kai...”

“But I promised to take you home, so that’s what I’m going to do first.”

Starlit night. The earth glowed purple as far as the eyes could see. They wouldn’t be taking the Rifts route this time.

He walked alone in the ghostly haze, far ahead of her.

Olivia ran, trying to catch up with him.

“Kai.”

She grabbed his hand, but his fingers didn’t twitch.

Kai didn’t even seem to notice her either, walking alone in the purple haze of the wastelands.

After a while, in silence, they set up camp with some supplies left behind by Constantino’s army.

Olivia hugged her legs as the fire cracked, hot orange tongues rising before her.

Could she turn him away from revenge? That’d be end of him.

She glanced at him over the campfire.

Kai stared at the flames with unblinking, sleepy eyes.

*No.* *What do I know? A couple days ago I wasn’t different from any of Constantino’s soldiers.*

She hugged herself tighter for comfort, remembering their conversation in the Rift.

*“I don’t have all answers myself, Olivia. Who do you think started this?”*

*“You did. With your warrior obsession, your hunger to conquer. We’re just trying to live our lives...”*

Olivia looked at him and saw the perfect body for war, and the most unfit soul for it, all merged in one.

*You didn’t start anything, Kai. With your gentle ways, your tender heart.*

She laid back and turned on her side, preparing herself to sleep.

“Good night...” she said, unanswered, as her eyelids hugged the sight of him.

The next day they had to cross a swamp to avoid Viker territory. Twisted trees. Steam fog hovering above the water surface. There was an old canoe with paddles at the shore, surrounded by fireflies.

“Let me help you,” Kai said, taking her waist.

That was unnecessary, but Olivia smiled; it was good to hear his voice again.

“Thank you.”

He lifted her to the canoe, and entered afterwards, kneeling in front of her.

They paddled, the muscles on his back drawing on his skin as he pulled water.

“Kai.”

“Yes?”

“Are you... alright?”

He glanced over his shoulder at her.

She stopped paddling when he turned, making the canoe sway slightly. There was something wrong with him.

Without warning, Kai closed the distance between them and pulled her to him by the shirt.

Olivia’s head flew back on its own when he kissed her neck. She squeezed his bare shoulders like her life depended on it.

“Kai, wait...” She murmured between gasps, then bit her lip, forcing herself to continue. “Wait... you’re not yourself.”

Her voice didn’t seem to reach him, and she was beyond speaking point now. Olivia stomped her feet, pushed and pulled him, her mind fighting her body, her body fighting her mind, between sighs and wild kisses. She gave up despite her better judgment. He was too much.

Olivia was dizzy when Kai stopped without warning. He pulled back slowly, looking at her eyes.

“I’m sorry,” he said.

Olivia shook her head without a word, her heart pounding like a war drum.

Kai returned to his side of the canoe and reclaimed his paddle.

She fixed her clothes, wishing she hadn’t stopped him, while thankful that she had strength to do so.

They continued as if nothing had happened, on the surface, at least. But his paddling became increasingly heavy.

The vegetation had grown thicker now, as tangled roots emerged from the water to breathe, branches and vines, slowing them down considerably.

Kai shifted in front of her, growing annoyed like she hadn’t seen him before. He grabbed his paddle, bringing them to a complete stop, then poked at the root that clung to the side of the canoe.

“Kai, let’s just keep going...”

He clicked his tongue, fighting harder against the root.

“This cursed swamp...” he said, ignoring her.

“Kai...”

Olivia latched to the swaying canoe for safety as he sprung to his feet.

He swung the paddle wildly at the vines, the misty air, smashed it against the water.

The paddle snapped in half.

Kai stopped, staring down at it.

“Come here,” she said, tears mounting under her eyes. “Let me hold you.”

He ignored her, hurling the broken paddle into the fog, then shouted at the top of his lungs, as the swamp echoed back his voice.

Dark clouds swelled in the sky. They found a cave to avoid the incoming rain and spend the night. Olivia did her best to make the interior of that damp cave habitable for them.

She dropped the hard ration they found into some boiling water. It smelled like used socks, like the HQ’s coffee.

Home came to mind, her friends, and those under her care as well.

She might never look at Paris the same way after everything that happened, and when it came to Marcus it was even more complicated...

*“Our enemies are cunning mimics, that’s for sure. They imitate human behavior to trick us.”*

Her words. Old ones, but still hers. Now it was hard to pinpoint who was the mimic and who was the human.

Could true humanity even be found in this world?

She glanced at Kai, pouring the stew on a dented bowl.

Perhaps not in heaps, but some here and there, buried under a hardened shell, hard enough to survive the world.

He prepared makeshift Viker traps and alarms at entrance in silence, true to his word despite everything.

Olivia was thankful for every second he was with her, as that meant he wouldn’t be seeking revenge for a little while.

Kai finished setting up the defenses and came back.

Food was ready.

They ate by the fire as rain poured outside. No words spoken, just glances.

“Thank you,” he said, wiping his mouth. “Good night.”

Kai lowered the bowl and stood up, turning towards his sleep spot.

Olivia took his arm.

“I’m sorry, Olivia. I didn’t mean to—”

“No.” She shook her head. “Come here.”

She reached for his head, pulling it gently to her chest.

Kai gasped as if he’d been holding his breath for a long time, then broke into tears as if he’d never cried before, soaking her clothes.

Olivia hugged him tighter as he did the same.

Inside a damp cave that smelled like old ration and moss, in the middle of the land of beasts, true humanity could be found.

It seemed Kai had already extinguished the fire when she woke up. Their camp was mostly packed up as well.

She rose to a sitting with a wide stretch of her arms, then saw him standing at the sunlit entrance.

He was busy disassembling the traps and alarms when his hands stopped.

Kai turned to face her, his eyes and voice soft once again.

“Good morning, Olivia.”

Olivia smiled.

“Good morning, Kai.”

She stood up and went to help him, as there was still a long way to go.

1nnqkcz,https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3325932/chinas-exports-africa-25-trumps-tariffs-bite-hard,China’s exports to Africa up by 25% as Trump’s tariffs bite hard,"Beijing has diversified its export routes amid the tariff war with the US, with high-value shipments to Africa growing by 25 per cent in the first eight months of this year.

According to China’s General Administration of Customs, exports to Africa totalled US$140.8 billion (1 trillion yuan) and grew between two and four times as fast as those to other major regions, such as Europe, Asia and Latin America.

Meanwhile, shipments to the US fell by 15.5 per cent in the period, as Beijing moved to diversify and divert its trade in response to new US tariffs. The US imposed tariffs of up to 100 per cent on electric vehicles and 50 per cent on solar cells, forcing Chinese firms to turn to emerging markets like Africa.

China-Africa specialist Lauren Johnston, a senior research fellow at the Melbourne-based think tank the AustChina Institute, said that soaring Chinese exports to Africa were a result of pressures elsewhere, especially following China’s tariff wars with the US.

“Tariffs to the US must be biting,” she said, adding that production might not be slowing proportionately.

Johnston said China was exporting its new growth areas, such as green transport, construction machinery and agricultural trade.

“Manufacturing construction goods was a big growth area,” she added.

As Chinese exports grew, the trade deficit between China and Africa widened to US$59.55 billion in the first eight months of the year, favouring Beijing. African exports to China grew by only 2.3 per cent year on year, reaching US$81.25 billion.

Total two-way trade between China and Africa was US$222 billion for the eight-month period, a 15.4 per cent year-on-year increase.

Africa’s exports to China are dominated by raw materials and commodities, with a smaller but growing share of agricultural goods. In contrast, China’s exports to the continent are mainly high-value manufactured goods, including machinery, electronics and green technology products.

Moreover, the demand for heavy machinery is soaring in Africa, as countries like Nigeria, South Africa, Egypt, Tanzania and Algeria undertake massive infrastructure projects that are either funded or built by China.

Solar exports to Africa rose by 60 per cent to 15 gigawatts in the 12 months to June this year, according to a new analysis from the energy think tank Ember.

Johnston added that Africans appeared happy to see construction, jobs and manufactured goods arriving to foster growth, and China was emphasising what it was buying in return, such as new agricultural exports.

Sub-Saharan Africa geoeconomic analyst Aly-Khan Satchu said the headline and eye-popping increase in Chinese exports to Africa revealed a significant shift in trade dynamics.

He said the stand-outs were construction machinery, which increased by 63 per cent; solar panels, which grew by 60 per cent, strong steel products and passenger vehicles, which more than doubled.

Satchu said this reflected China’s lock on the continent’s infrastructure and electrification roll-out.

“I look at these numbers as uniquely constructive as they speak to a much needed and overdue African \[capital expenditure\] acceleration,” Satchu said.

The continent attracted the largest volume of construction projects related to the Belt and Road Initiative – US$30.5 billion – in the first half of this year, a jump from US$6.1 billion recorded in the same period last year, according to a recent study by the Green Finance & Development Centre at Fudan University in Shanghai.

The study ranks Nigeria as the African nation with the highest volume of Chinese-funded or Chinese-built construction projects in the first half of this year.

In terms of scale, China’s trade with Africa may not be as important as with Asia, Europe and North America, but the continent is key to China’s long-run growth and market ambitions.

“Africa is where China takes its firms and brands global and where they get experience, create markets and brand recognition,” Johnston said.

Beijing has also removed tariffs on all products from all African countries, except eSwatini, which has diplomatic ties with Taipei.

Du Xiaohui, who oversees African affairs in the foreign ministry in Beijing, said in August that due to the zero tariff policy, China’s coffee imports from Africa totalled US$246 million from January to June 2025, surpassing the US$157 million recorded for the entire year of 2024.

However, Yufan Huang, a pre-doc fellow with the China-Africa Research Initiative at the Johns Hopkins University school of advanced international studies, said the Chinese government might need to do more to address the structural imbalance in trade to ensure sustainability.

“China has eliminated tariffs for African products, but Africa’s exports to China have not grown as quickly as expected,” Huang said.

Further, the government had encouraged Chinese companies to invest more in the continent, yet investment flows had remained sluggish, he added.",1,1758557060.0,Export,0,1.0,False

But Swiss restaurants? Most of them you won't find on the internet doing delivery. Most of them will have ridiculous prices of 20-30 or more for one portion, where ppl could buy 3 Kebabs or 2 pizzas with that money.

New Caffe Nero app customers can get a free barista prepared hot drink following their first purchase using the Caffè Nero app (scanning the app when paying). 

I go for the hot chocolate as I don’t like coffee and £2.50ish for a cup of tea is ridiculous!

You may also receive a voucher for a **free cake** on your birthday. Unsure if a previous purchase is required but each year they send me a voucher.

——————————

Steps:

* Download the Caffè Nero app: **https://nero.app.link/iaMgO58MQQb**
* **Register** an account.
* **Visit a Caffè Nero store, purchase a drink, and scan the app when paying**.
* **Your free drink voucher should appear in the app**. Go to the “wallet” section then “vouchers”. 
* To redeem your free drink ask the server to pay using the app. They will invite you to **scan the voucher QR code**.

——————————

Scan the app each time you purchase a hot drink to earn a stamp (or 2 stamps if using a reusable cup). Once **9 stamps** have been awarded you will automatically receive a **voucher** for a hot drink or iced drink (any-size) for free. Speciality Drinks and Extras are also included.

Pro tip, you only get 1 stamp per drinks order (2 if using a reusable cup). So if buying coffee for you and a friend ask to pay in 2 transactions and so scanning your app twice. Thus getting you 2 stamps (or 4 if using reusable cups).

1nnqe2j,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nnqe2j,"Laptop battery caught fire, can I just replace the battery?","I have a 2020 Razer Blade laptop that I use for work. I've done several upgrades to it over the years from RAM, to bigger SSDs, and last year, I replaced the battery with an aftermarket one... As the original battery was showing its age. 

This morning, while at a coffee shop, I started to smell burning plastic. Immediately turned off my laptop and went to investigate. After taking off the back cover, I've noticed the battery had a small fire at the point where the cable meets the battery pack. I was able to resolve the problem quick enough, to where there was no damage to the laptop chassis, and the laptop was running fine before I turned it off. 

Would it be safe to just replace the battery? I've done a quick inspection of the hardware, and it seems like the problem was isolated to the battery itself. It was running on the battery at the time of the fire, so I don't believe there's any issue with the charging port or anything. 

I know the proper etiquette would be to replace the laptop, but work has been slow, and that is an expense that I don't want to have right now. Additionally, I have a lot of work I need to get done in the next couple days... Which wouldn't be possible if waiting for a new laptop.

Wegwerf-Account, weil dummes Thema. 

Ich (35m) bin seit etwa einem Jahr mit meiner Freundin (31f) zusammen, soweit läuft es zwischen uns auch gut. 

Vor etwa 6 Monaten ist sie recht überraschend zu mir gezogen. Anfangs war das nur eine Übergangslösung, da ihre Wohnung abgebrannt ist und sie nicht zu ihren Eltern wollte. Nur ein paar Wochen, damit sie etwas neues finden könnte. Aus ein paar Wochen wurden 3 Monate, wir haben darüber gesprochen und offenbar wohnen wir nun zusammen. Ich meine, ich hätte eventuell schon skeptisch werden sollen, als sie die ganzen Umzugskartons auspackte und sich häuslich einrichtete. Naja, nun ist es eben so. 

Sie ist chronisch pleite - täglich Coffee to go, min. einmal die Woche Essen vom Lieferservice, Kino, Bars und Clubs, das läppert sich. In meinen Augen ist das rausgeworfenes Geld. Ich bin auch kein Sparfuchs, aber ich würde niemals täglich an die 10 Mäuse nur für Kaffee ausgeben. 

Natürlich habe ich ihr vor 3 Monaten auch gesagt, dass sie zumindest anteilig Miete & NK zahlen muss, wenn wir zusammen wohnen und da konnte ich ihr die Enttäuschung förmlich ansehen. Ich nehme an, dass sie dachte, dass ich sie einfach so bei mir wohnen lassen würde. Sie willigte aber ohne Diskussion ein. Diesen Monat hat sie mir nicht den abgesprochenen Betrag überwiesen, entschuldigte sich artig dafür und bat mich um Aufschub und Verständnis. Gut, kann schon mal passieren. Kein Problem. Ich würde auch nichts dazu sagen, wenn sie diesen Monat nichts dazu beiträgt, dann ist das eben mal so. 

Was mich aber auf die Palme bringt ist die Tatsache, dass sie mir eben eröffnet hat, dass sie spontan dazu entschieden hat am Donnerstag mit einer Freundin zusammen nach München zum Oktoberfest zu fahren. Wir wohnen nicht ansatzweise in der Nähe von München, sie wollen 8h+ mit dem Zug dorthin fahren, aufs Oktoberfest und es sich übers Wochenende einfach mal gut gehen lassen. 

Kein Geld für die Miete aufbringen können, aber aufs Oktoberfest wollen. Das ist genau der Humor, der mir gefällt. Nicht. Als ich ihr in Erinnerung gerufen habe, dass sie noch eine offene Rechnung hätte, da meinte sie beiläufig, dass es nicht nur eine sei und sie sich schon darum kümmern würde. Aber sie bräuchte einfach mal etwas Spaß und ich solle nicht so engstirnig sein.

He doesn’t post selfies, he doesn’t write captions, and he definitely doesn’t spend hours thinking about hashtags. Yet somehow, people line up to like his every nap, snack, and tail wag.

The truth is, pets have the perfect formula for Instagram fame without even trying. They’re cute no matter what angle you shoot from, they don’t overthink their “brand,” and they never accidentally post a blurry night-out photo. Meanwhile, I’m stressing over filters and wondering if people will judge me for posting twice in one week.

Turns out, people just want joy. My feed might be a mix of coffee shots, sunsets, and “deep thoughts,” but my dog? He’s pure serotonin with paws.

So if you’ve ever wondered why your pet is more popular online than you are, it’s simple: they’re living their best life, while we’re too busy trying to make ours look like it.",1,1758556474.0,InstagramMaster,0,1.0,False

I have had a quite a few people reach out to me with interest in joining such a group or wanting to find time to grab coffee/ drinks/ etc.

Also big thank you to everyone who had awesome recommendations.

I was thinking of planning a happy hour soon to gather everyone together and get some movement on the idea while making it low stakes and low commitment for anyone interested.

Would anyone be interested in joining something like this?

I was thinking of making a flyer for like a Thursday night at like Forward or somewhere easy to gather outside but am willing to take any ideas that yall may have.

I figure if a lot of us are struggling socially here, let’s make this a group effort and get to meet all our fellow young-ins in town. Maybe even make this a once a month event??

I (20F) only drank two 12 oz cans (1 can each day for two days). Now, the thing is that caffeine doesn't really seem to work on me at all so I never really drank coffee or other caffeinated drinks. Hence why I wanted to try Red Bull out of curiosity. Well, right after that I began to wake up with joint pain in my fingers and wrists, along with swollen fingers that would go down during the day and swell back up in the morning. Fast forward to today and I still have these symptoms. I thought that with time it would get better, but these symptoms are persistent and also seem to get worse especially with more caffeine intake. Before this happened, I was generally healthy and had a balanced diet and I do not take any medications.

I've tried to search up this issue on Google and tried looking into allergic reactions to caffeine, but I don't think my symptoms fit the ones listed for a caffeine allergy. Now I'm at a loss for what is happening to me.

1nnq4vo,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nnq4vo,"Lost Pubs of London - The Markham Arms, Chelsea SW3","I have been digging into the past of another lost pub of Chelsea, the Markham Arms that stood at 137 the Kings Road (image 1). The Markham Arms presents a classic mid-Victorian public house frontage, distinguished by its gently curving façade on the King’s Road. Tall Corinthian pilasters divide wide, arched windows, framing a central entrance with double doors. Above, an ornate wrought-iron balcony runs the length of the first floor, softening the solid brickwork and echoing Chelsea’s decorative tradition, being often vividly painted during its later life. The attached photos (images 2, 3, 4 and 5) span its post Second World War life and sadly I could not locate a 19^(th) Century image.

The Markham Arms takes its name from Matthew Markham (or the Markham family in general), who owned Box Farm, a tract of land on the north side of the King’s Road, north-west of the Chelsea Hospital and what is now Burton Court. You can see the farm on John Carys 1824 map of Chelsea (image 6), that also shows in the early nineteenth century, how Chelsea was still semi-rural. The King’s Road was increasingly opening up as a public thoroughfare rather than just a private or semi-royal carriage route, with it being officially opened to the public in 1830. This made it an attractive area for speculative land purchase and suburban residential development. The placement of Box Farm provided just such an opportunity.

In 1825 a private Act of Parliament (the Markham Square Act 1825) was passed to facilitate development of part of the old orchard and farm land. Following that, the first houses in what became Markham Square were completed on the west side by the early 1840s. Over the course of the Victorian era more of the terraces and streets including Markham Street and other associated property fronting King’s Road that would include the pub were built up. The development and building progress can be seen in the comparing the 1851 (image 7) and the 1867 (image 8) London OS maps.

I believe the pub must been completed it must have been completed in the early 1850s, as it is missing from the 1851 census records for the Kings road. However, I found an 1854 advertisement in *Bell’s Life in London* (image 9), announcing that a “Stallion Greyhound, Mansoor, will serve bitches this season … Apply to W. Marshall, Markham Arms, King’s Road, Chelsea.” This is the earliest known printed references to the Pub I could find, suggesting that by the mid-1850s the Markham Arms was trading on the newly built frontage, serving locals and sportsmen amid the fields and new terraces of west Chelsea.

By the mid-1960s the Markham Arms had become part of the King’s Road’s new social geography; a stylish stop amid the boutiques and coffee bars of “Swinging London.” A 1967 feature in *The News* described it as one of the “in pubs” of Chelsea, alongside the Chelsea Potter, places “where a few people go to be looked at and a lot of others go to oblige them,” (image 10) marking the road’s passage to the capital’s fashion strip (Chelsea News, 16 June 1967). Through the 1970s the Markham retained that cachet, its atmosphere amusingly described in the *Kensington Post* as “roomy, pleasantly arranged, and dark enough to make everybody look beautiful” (Kensington Post, 5 May 1972). Beyond its appeal to models, musicians and weekend sightseers, the pub was also known for its openness to Chelsea’s emerging gay scene; Saturday afternoons were an established meeting time for local gay men (image 11), making the Markham one of the friendliest and most visible mixed pubs in west London during an era when few venues offered such welcome.

Despite its storied past, like many London pubs in the late 1980s and 1990s the Markham Arms began to feel the effects of changing tastes, fashions and economic pressures and it eventually closed as a pub in the early 1990s. It was then converted into a bank branch (image 12), but in recent years the building too has been shuttered and is without a commercial tenant. Perhaps a new entrepreneurial publican will see its potential, and the Markham Arms may once again throw open its doors to the Chelsea crowd.

A notable post-pub episode was that during the 2008 siege in nearby Markham Square, the bank branch (at that time a Santander) was used as a police on-site headquarters. The siege began around 5 pm when Mark Saunders, a 32-year old barrister living in Markham Square, opened fire with a shotgun from his flat. Armed police units responded; over the course of about five hours there were exchanges of gunfire with marksmen from the Metropolitan Police’s CO19 unit. Ultimately Saunders was shot dead by police after refusing to surrender",1,1758556109.0,london,1,0.6,False

For those of you who don't know me and are new to the game I am **d3adr1nger!**  I've been working on [ShadowShowdown.com](http://ShadowShowdown.com), a deck builder and overall useful app for Shadowverse Evolve, for the past 6 months, and just dropped what I think is a pretty unique feature for TCG sites.

**Card Price Alerts are now live!** 🔔

You can set **target prices** on any card and get email notifications when they hit your price point in **TCGPlayer**. You can set alerts for price drops (*great for players wanting better deals*) or price increases (*perfect for collectors/sellers tracking value*).

>This is only limited, **for cards with prices**, I'll code in the future a way to get notified when a card without a price gets listed

**How it works:**

* Go to any card's profile page
* Set your target price or percentage change
* Get emailed when it triggers

**The cool part:** If multiple alerts trigger on the same day, you get one consolidated email instead of spam. I check prices 4x daily, so worst case you'd get 4 emails per day (but realistically probably just 1).

Everyone gets 5 free alerts to try it out, and supporters get 20.

**Soon to come:**

* A Datatable to see all your price alerts gathered. For now, you can only see them on the card's profile.
* ***HOPEFULLY:*** CardMarket support! ( Still waiting for the game to be listed ) 



**About the supporter thing**

I try to keep everything free and always make sure new features have free options, but I've got a little $**2/month supporter tier** for anyone who digs what I'm building and wants to help keep the servers running! You get some cool extras like more alerts, better deck search filters, and whatever new stuff I'm cooking up (still working on some fun features 😄).

But yeah, no core features are locked away - it's just a ""buy me a coffee monthly ☕"" kind of deal for people who want to support the project and get some cool features out of it! Here is the [plan page](https://shadowshowdown.com/plans).

  
Enjoy guys! And as always please feel free to interact! join the [discord server](https://discord.gg/jwP4xPT3vM), tell me what you don't like, if you found a bug, what you would like to see, and more importantly what would help **you** as a player.

one morning she freaked tf out and started screaming at my dad and smashing a bunch of stuff running around the house saying nobody loves her and a bunch of stuff and 10 year old me was trying to console her but then my dad just took me to a coffee shop and we just stayed there for awhile and came back to my mom packing her stuff. my 2 older brothers were at friends houses during this so they didn’t see what i saw. it was pretty traumatic. 

throughout middle school i wanted to see her but my dad wouldn’t let me and i didn’t know why. we would literally sneak around to see eachother but it was tricky. my mom would talk a bunch of crap about my dad and his new gf (i love her now but disliked her at the time because of what my mom was feeding me) and she would fill my head with bs meanwhile my saint of a dad protected me and never talked bad about her (even though later found out she cheated on him and was doing drugs). she played victim a lot and i believed it until i was in like mid highschool i started being like hmmm.

our contact has been very dodgy over the years like ill see her for holidays and stuff and once in a blue moon just to see her but i dont feel the biggest motherly connection with her like i did as a child. what’s sad is i had such bad separation anxiety with her as a child i would cling to her, sleep with her every night, cried when she dropped me off at school and begged her to stay. and now its just nothing. i want so badly to feel about her how i did as a child but its all so tainted now. 

i’m 21 for about a month now and i didnt see her for my bday or even answer her. i just have so much anxiety to answer her and she’s been calling me everyday now. she called me 4 times back to back last night and now im almost worried something might be happening but i still can’t get myself to answer her. i think my brothers would tell me if something happened though because they’re in contact with her. 

my brothers are both 2 and 3 years older than me and my younger older brother has given me so much shit for not talking to her and me and him haven’t talked in months. i texted him happy bday in june w no response and he didn’t say anything on my bday last month. his girlfriend texted me happy bday though and she still checks in with me and understands my pov cuz ive talked with her about it when we used to work together. my oldest brother doesn’t even talk about it with me and me and him are chill and talk pretty regularly. 

my dad and his gf are understanding too and just tell me to do what makes me feel comfortable and they’re supportive no matter what i decide to do. my problem is i don’t know what to do. i find myself feeling super sad for my mom and wanting to be there for her because it’s still my mom but there’s also not the same connection. it’s ironic too because im so quick to read posts like these and immediately be like “bruh just don’t talk to them anymore” but it’s also so difficult when you’re in the situation.

i think i want to atleast text her back soon just to ease the stress in my mind but i don’t know what to say because i don’t want her thinking i don’t love her but im also not exactly ready to be seeing her and i don’t know why. it’s like i do but i dont. AGGGHGHH!!! another issue is that ive told her so many times like “yo i dont really like calling or texting it makes me anxious” so she’ll be like “ik it makes you anxious butttt…..” and goes on about whatever. i feel sad for her but again im just not ready.

i just feel so conflicted and don’t know what to say to her because its really been taking a toll on my mental health. my boyfriend has been a huge support and my friends are also really understanding and supportive so atleast i have that going for me but its still up to me to figure it out. 

if anyone has been through similar or even if u haven’t i just need some advice because im getting to the point where i get a pit in my stomach when thinking about it because its causing so much anxiety. help >.<

Bleu de Chanel? Also good.
Cool Water? Classic for a reason.
Nautica Voyage? At ₹1500? Absolutely brilliant.

I'm tired of frag snobs trashing on fragrances that literally millions of people enjoy. Like the entire world has anosmia except for 2000 people on fragrance forums who've ""educated their nose.""

## The Popular Fragrance Hate Timeline

It goes like this:

**Stage 1**: You smell YSL Y at a mall. You think ""wow, this is nice and versatile."" Maybe you buy it.

**Stage 2**: You discover online fragrance communities.

**Stage 3**: You learn that Y is ""generic,"" Sauvage is ""synthetic garbage,"" Bleu de Chanel is ""boring,"" and Cool Water is ""dated.""

**Stage 4**: You start repeating these opinions. Not because your nose changed. Because you want to fit in with people who own 47 bottles of niche.

**Stage 5**: You buy some ₹20,000 niche that smells like a medical experiment gone wrong because someone with a YouTube channel said it's ""challenging and artistic.""

**Stage 6**: You wear it twice, then go back to your ""basic"" fragrance when nobody's looking.

## Let's Decode the Complaints

**""It's too common/everyone wears it""**

You know what else everyone wears? White Shirt. Blue Jeans. Black Shoes. Popularity isn't a flaw - it's usually a sign that something works.

Bleu de Chanel didn't become the global best-seller by accident. It became popular because it smells fucking good to most humans. Revolutionary concept, I know.

**""It's boring/safe/generic""**

Translation: ""It doesn't smell like a moldy tomb from 1347 mixed with burnt tyres.""

Cool Water is ""boring""? It literally created an entire genre. Every fresh fragrance you love is Cool Water's grandchild. That's like calling the Beatles boring because you've heard modern music.

**""Nautica Voyage is a cheap freshie""**

 It costs ₹1500 and smells better than half the ₹10,000 niche freshies that fragrance influencers push. If Nautica Voyage was in a Tom Ford bottle for ₹15,000, the same people trashing it would call it ""a masterful aquatic composition with remarkable artistic nuances.""

**""These are for people who don't know fragrance""**

No, these are for people who want to smell good without taking out a personal loan. Sorry we can't all drop ₹30,000 on  some niche house to impress three people who are nose deep in the fragrance rabbithole.

## The Numbers Game Nobody Wants to Play

Sauvage - #1 globally for years
Bleu de Chanel - Top 5 consistently  
Cool Water - Still selling after 30+ years
YSL Y - Destroying sales charts
Nautica Voyage - The budget king that won't die

But sure, the 3 people in your  fragrance group who worship discontinued Guerlains have better taste than literally millions of consumers worldwide. 

It's like claiming butter chicken isn't good because your foodie friend prefers some unknown Naga curry. Both can be great tasting. One just happens to please more people.

## The Hipster Mathematics

The formula is simple:

Fragrance quality when unknown = 10/10
Fragrance quality when popular = 4/10
Fragrance quality when discontinued = 11/10

Watch how fast the community turns on current favorites. Aventus went from holy grail to ""overpriced and reformulated trash"" the moment regular people started buying it. 

Rasasi Hawas has started to get the ""too popular"" treatment with Akshay Khanna pic.  Give it two years and people will pretend they never liked it. In fact, ask any person on the street to take sniff and they would say it smells great. 

## What These Fragrances Actually Are

They're perfectly engineered solutions to ""I want to smell good.""

**Sauvage**: Fresh, mass pleasing, works everywhere
**Bleu de Chanel**: Sophisticated, versatile, office-safe
**Cool Water**: Fresh aquatic that defined a generation
**YSL Y**: Sweet-fresh that's actually interesting and very versatile
**Nautica Voyage**: Smells expensive at ₹1500
**Rasasi Hawas**: Fresh, sweet and budget friendly

Are they challenging art pieces? No.
Are they effective at their job? Absolutely.

They're the Hyundai Creta of fragrances. Reliable, well-made, gets you where you need to go. Not everyone needs a vintage Ferrari that breaks down every 100km but ""has character. There’s a reason we see so many Cretas on the road.

## The Secret Everyone's Hiding

Check any fraghead's collection. I guarantee behind those Xerjoffs and Amouages and Penhalligons, there's one basic mass pleaser they mostly wear. 

They wear their niche to fragrance meetups. They wear their ""basic"" fragrances to actual life.

## The Newcomer Tragedy

Someone discovers fragrances. They smell Rasasi Hawas and love it. They excitedly join online communities to learn more.

Within a week, they're convinced their nose is ""uneducated"" because they don't appreciate fragrances that smell like ""wet cement mixed with cardamom and existential dread.""

They end up buying Zoologist Bat because a reviewer said it's ""animalic genius."" Then they wonder why people flinch their nose around them.

Meanwhile, that Rasasi Hawas would've had them smelling great.

## The Real Crime

People are spending ₹50,000 on niche collections they barely wear while trashing ₹5,000 mass pleasers that would actually get used.

Your unused bottle of Oud for Greatness isn't superior to someone's daily-worn Cool Water. One brings joy daily, the other you really need to find an occasion to wear.

## Why This Actually Matters

Because gatekeeping is killing the fun.

Newcomers can't enjoy Hawas without Akshay Khanna memes.
People preface ""I know it's basic but..."" before admitting they like YSL Y.
Someone wearing Cool Water is called they smell like an Old Man.

Imagine if every time someone ordered a cappuccino, coffee snobs appeared to explain why they should be drinking single-origin Ethiopian pour-over. That's what we've become.

## The Truth That'll Get Me Banned

Popular fragrances are popular because they're good.

Not ""good for beginners."" Not ""good if you can't afford better."" Not ""good enough.""

Just good.

Bleu de Chanel smells sophisticated and pleasant. Sauvage smells fresh and powerful. Cool Water smells clean and aquatic. Hawas smells fresh and sweet. And Nautica Voyage smells good and is cheap.  That's it. That's the review.

Your wife probably prefers your ""basic"" YSL Y over your ₹25,000 oud collection. Your colleagues appreciate your ""boring"" Bleu de Chanel more than your ""interesting"" Nasomatto. The general public likes when you smell like Sauvage, not like you fell into a vat of Cambodian frankincense.

## The Conclusion

Wear what you like. If that's Creed, great. If that's Cool Water, also great. If that's Bella Vita because that's what you can afford, respect.

Stop letting people with 100 bottles (95 unused) tell you that your 2-bottle collection of ""generic"" fragrances is boring.

The fragrance community has convinced itself that inaccessible equals better. That challenging equals sophisticated. That popular equals bad.

But sometimes, millions of people like something because it's actually good. ",6,1758555815.0,DesiFragranceAddicts,3,1.0,False

So here I am fellow Dads. If anyone would be open to chatting...I'd be more than welcome talking. 

Maybe someone has gone through something similar? Has some advice? Anything to help my process this complex life. 

I’ve been with my wife for over 20 years. For the longest time, kids weren’t in the cards so we traveled, worked hard, and built a life. Then three years ago we got our miracle: our son Ezra. He was born with Cloacal Exstrophy and a handful of other serious conditions, and from that moment, everything changed.

We found the best doctors, sold what we had, and rebuilt our lives around him. I sold my business and took a third-shift dispatch job so my wife could stay by his side through surgeries and hospital stays. It’s cost us hundreds of thousands, more sleepless nights than I can count, and just about every comfort we used to know. I used to be a world-class pyrotechnician I’ve got a world championship trophy on my wall now I’m 40 and living check to check. And I’d still choose this fight every single time.

And as if God wanted to crank the chaos to eleven, a year later we were blessed with **twins**. Ezra’s little brother and sister are two now. So yeah… three kids under three. The house is wild, loud, messy, and absolutely full of life. It’s beautiful and exhausting all at once.

Some days Ezra’s unstoppable laughing, curious, full of light. Other days, the weight of his condition hits harder. I’m tired in a way I never knew was possible. Some mornings, dragging myself out of bed feels like lifting a mountain. But I still put my armor on and march forward, because being their dad is the most important fight of my life.

**Here’s the part that eats at me:** I can’t even bring myself to buy simple creature comforts anymore. A new pair of shoes. A coffee out. Anything just for me. Every time I think about it, anxiety kicks in because I know the next big hit is always coming: a new prosthetic leg, more colostomy supplies, another surgery that means weeks off work. So I go without because they never can.

I’m proud of them. Proud of my wife. Proud of the life we’re building even in the middle of all this chaos. But I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t worn down. Some days I just feel like John Coffey in *The Green Mile* whispering, “I’m tired, boss.” </3",3,1758555326.0,daddit,1,0.71,False

1nnpr1o,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nnpr1o,Had the best time in Baltimore,"I will preface this by saying that I went to school here around a decade back so not totally unfamiliar with the food/drink scene but Baltimore has evolved so much since that I keep coming back time and again to try new places. 

I have a very long list of things to try but could only fit so much in a day and a half plus my main goal this past weekend was to explore the cocktail bars. 

Day 1: We reached around noon. Took the bus to Blueprint cafe. I had so many good reviews about their asian inspired pastries that I was dying to try it. I hate to say but the Pandan cake and Matcha Pan de Sal was a little disappointing - looked really good on paper and irl. My black sesame latte was very mild but husband’s Vietnamese iced coffee was pretty good. 

From there we were too full and left for our Hotel. After a break at our hotel, we went to Ejji to try their Fiery dry pork noodles and they were just outstanding. Perfectly spicy without burning my insides and full of flavor. Loved the thicccc Udon noodles. 

Our original plan was to get Arepas at Alma Cocina Latina but unfortunately their Arepa window was closed this past weekend. But no worries as it gives us another reason to visit Baltimore again. 

From their we went directly to Mama Koko’s for some cocktails. We only got 1 each because our plan was to bar hop and didn’t want to get drunk too soon. I saw Mama Koko saying hi to everyone and gosh is she enigmatic. Loved her sense of style! 

After this we went to Dutch Courage: the bartender was so friendly and the menu so impressive - we had 2 cocktails each - one of them being the PSL Ramos Gin Fizz which I urge everyone to try at least once. The smoothest cocktail I have had. 

Next was W.C. Harlan: wow what a vibe! Not onlu did I absolutely enjoyed my drink with Pistachio and rose petals but I was absolutely stunned by the interior. I hate to say but Philly (where I live now) unfortunately doesn’t have anything close to it. 

Then we went to The Elk Room: I know a lot of people will hate me for giving my money to the Atlas group but I honestly had no idea about it until I read about them intrigued by the Atlas Quarter signage outside. To be honest, I didn’t really like my drink there so there’s that. I was hungry at this point looking for Pizza which is the only food I want to eat after 5 drinks and found myself next door at the Italian Disco. We ordered the Diavolo and oh gosh was it spicy but so good!!! This was the end of our night (around 1 AM) as we had a brunch reservation at Ammoora the following morning and wanted a good night’s sleep before that. 

Day 2: Brunch at Ammoora: first of all the interior and decor - can I just say that it is one of the most beautiful restaurants I have been to? Also hospitality - right from the hostess to our server, everyone was so friendly and welcoming. We sat outdoors and I felt like being transported to some beautiful middle eastern country. We enjoyed everything we got but their deserts were especially phenomenal. I can attest that no restaurant in Philly holds a candle to Ammoora in terms of hospitality and flavors. 

That was it for last weekend but I have many more places on my list to try and I will be back soon! I will most definitely visit Dutch Courage, W. C. Harlan and Ammoora again! And of course can’t wait to try the Arepas at Alma Cocina.

1nnppur,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1nnppur/snapped_at_my_ex_girlfriend_and_feel_terrible/,Snapped at my ex girlfriend and feel terrible about it,"I’m a barista in an office building, my ex worked in the office which is how we met. I broke up with her because it wasn’t working, but we still loved each other and I was completely heartbroken. 

For the first month after our breakup, she continued to come into the cafe every day. It was really upsetting to me because I felt trapped; I didn’t have a choice whom I served or where to go. But I didn’t want to tell her what to do so I put up with it. 

But after a month, I was still getting triggered every time I had to make a drink for her. So I decided to send her a text. It said something like:

“Hey, I’m sorry but I feel like I need some more space at work. I don’t always feel comfortable seeing you every day, and I want you to understand it’s different for me because I’m not ready but I don’t have a choice. And it hurts me that we ignore each other and pretend like we’re invisible. I can’t tell you what to do or where to go, but I’d appreciate it if you could try and order during my break. But again, you can keep doing whatever you want, I just want to let you know how I feel.”

She got really angry and responded: 

“If you want more interaction, you can initiate them because you ignore me too. And frankly, it’s not about you, I just come for my coffee.”

That really set me off because I felt like I tried setting a boundary and it got minimized and blown off completely. I felt like she was saying, “I do what I want” and I’m just forced to deal with it and shut up. 

I said something like:

“If you’re in a place where I mean nothing to you, congratulations, but that’s not how I feel. I was hoping that by opening up to you about my feelings, we could work together. But you’re right you don’t have to give a fuck about me. Just remember these drinks are made by your ex boyfriend. It might be easy for you to pick them up, but I’m the one who has to make them for you. And if I wanted more interactions, I wouldn’t have sent you a text asking for more space. I just want it to not be weird.”

She never responded and has never come back to the cafe. 

I think I was in the right to let her know I needed space, but I feel ashamed and embarrassed about losing my temper and getting angry with her. She has completely avoided the cafe for the last two months, which isn’t what I wanted; I just wanted to ask for some space. I didn’t want her to feel like she had to avoid the cafe entirely. 

I feel guilty because she was my partner for over a year. I care about her so much and I wanted to be on good terms, but instead I set off an emotional bomb. I was in a lot of pain; I was heartbroken by the breakup too. I loved her so much and every time I saw her it was like reopening the wound. But I should’ve handled it better. I know it was wrong of me. 

I want to reach out and apologize and invite her back, but I know I can’t do that. It’s been two months of silence and complete avoidance. I think she’s pretty much done with me. And that just sucks. She, and our relationship, deserved better than this messy painful end. I really wanted to be able to reach out one day, have a conversation, be on good terms, cus like I said we still loved each other and she means so much to me. But I think I slammed that door shut.

\----------

I woke up at the sound of another truck's brakes hissing as it settled in for the night. I fumbled for my phone to check the time. The cold blue glow hit my eyes like a slap.

***03:12 A.M.***

I dropped it back down, scrubbed at my face, put my glasses on, and got dressed.

The truck stop was basically dead at this hour. The cashier printed out my shower ticket and handed it to me.

“Customer number four, your shower is now ready. Head to shower number one,” the cold robotic voice said over the speaker.

The shower was dry; I was the first person to use it. I let the hot water beat against me, loosening my muscles and rinsing away the last of my exhaustion. After drying off, I pulled on the clean clothes I’d brought in and laced up my dusty boots.

The diner lights spilled warm yellow over the lot. Inside, the air smelled of coffee grounds and fryer grease. A waitress walked over, slid me a menu, and walked away.

“Eggs, toast, and a short stack. And can I get some coffee to go as soon as I’m done here?” I said when she came back to take my order.

“Sure thing, hon’.”

My phone started ringing as I put my wallet back in my pocket. I grabbed my coffee and answered as I walked back to my rig.

“Mornin’, Ron. Where are we heading today?”

“Morning, Jake,” Ron said. “You’re heading over to Billings for a pickup and delivering in Flagstaff. Trailer’s preloaded, so you just gotta hook up.”

“That’s quite a run, Ron. Sounds like fun. Send me the details.”

“Glad you think so,” Ron replied with a chuckle.

“Just sent everything over to you. Keep me updated. Have a safe drive, brother.”

“Will do. Talk later.”

I took a sip of coffee, started the engine, and eased out of the lot.

About an hour later, I rolled into the shipper's yard. I pulled my brakes, letting out a deafening hiss of air, and walked into the office.

“Mornin’, ma’am,” I said to a very tired-looking office worker.

“Good morning, driver. Do you have a pickup number?”

After giving her all the relevant information, she told me where my trailer was parked, and I left the office. As I walked out, I couldn’t help but feel that the whole interaction was… off. The lady at the desk just seemed so robotic and transactional. I justified the feeling with the fact that this was Montana, after all. Maybe she was one of its more antisocial residents. By the time I wrapped up that thought, I found myself at the trailer I was supposed to be picking up—and right next to it, an empty spot for me to drop the empty trailer.

***Score***

I dropped my empty, hooked to the preloaded trailer, checked the lights and seals, and signed the BOL. I was ready to hit the road. I sat in the driver's seat, buckled in, punched the receiver's address into my Garmin, and started driving.

The Garmin glowed steady on the dash, pointing me south. Wide sky, open road.

The morning miles were smooth. Montana stretched wide under a pale sky, mountains leaning at the horizon. The engine purred, steady and strong, and the road unrolled in front of me like it was made just for me.

I cracked the window to let the chill air whip through the cab. It smelled clean, like pine and dry grass, and it woke me up better than caffeine ever could. Not that I was short on that. My thermos was still half full of the truck-stop brew I’d topped off before dawn. Hot, dark, strong enough to float a spoon. The good stuff.

The CB hummed on low. Every now and then somebody chimed in with a weather update or a joke that had been making the rounds since the eighties. I grinned at one I’d heard three times already this week. Out here, repetition didn’t matter, it was the rhythm of voices that counted, a reminder you weren’t the only one chasing miles.

By the time I hit the Wyoming line, the rig and I had synced up. Hands loose on the wheel, foot light on the throttle, the hum of the tires sinking into me until it felt less like driving and more like flying an endless ribbon of asphalt.

I was being passed by a tanker, looking over I saw him giving a two-finger wave, I gave him the same in return. Simple communication, understood instantly. A wave. A nod. A flash of lights. The whole language of the road that made strangers into something a little closer.

The world was wide open. A hawk traced lazy circles overhead, looking for its next meal. A coyote ran along the shoulder, glanced my way, and kept trotting.

By midmorning, I was ready to stretch my legs. I swung into a rest area: picnic tables, a row of tired cottonwoods, and the usual handful of rigs idling under the blue sky. I hopped down, rolled my shoulders, and let the stiffness shake out. The air smelled like sage and dust, cut through with diesel.

A couple of other drivers were hanging around. One was sitting on a camping chair he’d just pulled out of his cab’s storage compartment, smoking a cigarette. Another leaned against his door, scrolling his phone. We traded nods. No talk needed. Everyone was on their own clock, doing their own thing.

I reached up into the cab, grabbed my thermos, poured the last of it into my cup, and leaned on the hood while I sipped. Sun climbing, breeze light, highway stretching south. Days like this reminded me why I liked the job. Twenty-six years old, strong, behind the wheel of eighty thousand pounds with the whole country at my feet. No boss breathing down my neck, no walls closing in. Nothing like that corporate life I couldn’t wait to leave behind. Just me, the truck, and the road.

I drained my coffee, tossed the cup into the trash, and got back on the road.

Back on the highway, the hours kept rolling. Music low. Tires humming. Everything was going smoothly and as expected. Except for the little things.

The mile markers.

I started noticing gaps that shouldn’t have been there. Ninety-four. Ninety-five. Ninety-seven. Then back to ninety-six. I told myself I’d misread them, but it happened more than once. Ninety-seven. Eighty-three. Ninety-nine. I was struggling to find a logical reason for what I was seeing. My thoughts were interrupted by a sound from the CB.

A loud transmission of static, sharp enough to cut through my music. I dialed the squelch, but the hiss stayed longer than it should have. Underneath it, I thought I heard a voice, tinny and far away. By the time I raised the volume, it was gone.

For a while, it was all small stuff. Not too difficult to forget about. Nothing worth more than a raised eyebrow. After all, you tend to see a lot of weird things on these roads. Incorrect road signs weren’t common, but not unheard of.

But mile after mile, it stacked up.

The fuel gauge twitched once, hard enough to catch my eye, then snapped back like nothing had happened. A second later, the outside temp on the dash flashed 128°F before settling back to sixty-eight.

I passed a billboard for some local injury lawyer, a tear by the lawyer's ear. Ten minutes later, there it was again: same lawyer, same tear, same bent post holding it up.

A silver sedan appeared ahead of me, hugging the right lane, going well under the speed limit. I gained on it, pulled left to pass, gave a glance at the driver's seat. Empty. No driver, no passenger. Just a pale silhouette in the driver’s seat—maybe a jacket, maybe not. By the time I looked again, I couldn’t find the sedan anywhere.

Another twenty miles, and I spotted a blue minivan with bikes strapped to the back. A few miles later, the same van again: same cracked taillight, same crooked bike rack. I tightened my grip on the wheel, eyes flicking to the mirror, half expecting it to vanish too. But it just stayed behind me until I lost it on a curve.

Even the road itself felt strange. Once, the shadows of the fence posts stretched across the pavement the wrong way, like the sun had moved without me noticing. Then, just as quick, they snapped back where they belonged. It felt like I was looking at one of those optical illusions that play with your perspective.

Nothing I couldn’t tenuously explain away. Just a pile of little wrongs adding weight to my mind, mile after mile, until I realized my shoulders were tight, my jaw clenched.

I needed to pull over.

The next rest area sign popped up: **“Rest Area – 2 Miles.”**

Relief eased through me, just knowing I had a chance to stretch and reset. But two miles stretched longer than they should have. The road kept running empty, no ramps, no sign of the lot.

Finally, after what felt like ten minutes, I saw it again: **“Rest Area – 2 Miles.”**

My stomach sank.

I flicked the blinker anyway, hoping maybe—just maybe—it was an error on the state’s part and that the exit ramp would be showing up any minute now. But no exit ever came. Just more pavement, more sky, more nothing.

The CB sputtered again. A burst of static, then silence. Then, soft and thin, like someone talking down a tunnel:

*“… two miles …”*

I snapped it off.

That’s when I caught movement in my mirror. Headlights. Faint, but there. A pair of them, way back in the foggy distance. My chest eased slightly at the sight of another vehicle. But when I blinked, they were closer. Another blink, and they were gone.

I pressed harder on the wheel. My knuckles ached.

The dash lights glowed too bright, like night had already fallen, but the windshield still showed daylight. It didn’t line up. My ELD ticked down to 05:15, then froze. I tapped the screen. No change. A few more miles, still 05:15.

I tightened my grip on the wheel, eyes fixed ahead.

And then, the light began to change.

At first it looked like a storm front. The sky dimmed, shadows dragging across the asphalt. But there weren’t any clouds. By late afternoon it looked like dusk, and accompanying it was the fog.

Not wisps. Not patches. Heavy. Alive. It poured across the highway in sheets, swallowing the horizon. It looked like waves of water coming in at high speed. My high beams hit it and bounced back, filling the cab with ghost-light.

I glanced at the GPS. The map was blank. No towns. No exits. Just a straight pink line through nothing.

But the “next turn” kept jumping.   
  
*112 miles.*  
*8 miles.*   
*64 miles.*   
*200 miles.*   
*12 miles.*

The numbers slid and stuttered like they couldn’t decide how far I was from anything. Sometimes they flashed so quickly I couldn’t even catch them. I tapped the screen, zoomed in and out, but the display just pulsed gray, stretching endlessly south.

Then I looked at the ELD. The drive clock still showed 5 hours and 15 minutes left in my shift. And it stayed there. Ten miles. Twenty. Fifty. Still 5:15.

Every driver knows those numbers shave down no matter what. Minutes always slipping away, grain by grain, each one burned with every mile. The relentless march of time that we all faced. But mine did not move.

My body knew better. Eyes burning, shoulders tight, throat dry. Fatigue settled into my bones, but the machine swore I had not lost a second.

I reset the tablet, even pulled the plug and forced a reboot. When it blinked back to life, the screen was bright and fresh. The number never changed. 5:15.

I tightened my grip on the wheel. My palms had gone damp.

The highway stretched on, flat and endless. My body swore I had been in the seat for hours, maybe all day, but nothing outside proved it. No towns. No exits. Not even a curve. Just the same stretch of asphalt running on forever.

The CB hissed. Just static at first, and slowly it started to sound like voices trying to be heard.

Finally, whispers bled through.

*“… Jacob …”*   
*“… tired …”*   
*“… almost there …”*

I turned the squelch. Static stayed. I dropped the volume, but the voices carried anyway, thin and broken, almost like they were riding under the hum of the tires.

*“… keep going … do not stop …”*

I yanked the power cord. The screen went black, dead. For two miles the silence held. Then the speaker popped and crackled back alive—no cable, no power, nothing.

*“… behind you …”*

The words landed cold in my stomach.

The fog thickened, if that was even possible. My high beams hit it and bounced back, painting the cab in a pale glow that left shadows crawling across the ceiling. The road lines bled to gray. I leaned forward as far as I could just to keep the truck centered.

The speedometer dipped without warning. Seventy. Fifty. Thirty. Back to seventy. The truck never slowed, but the needle danced as if it were trying to lie to me.

The air shifted next. Damp and cold, filling my lungs like water. My breath came out in clouds, frosting the inside of the windshield. Then the smell hit. Mildew. Rotting pond water. Wet fabric left to sour. I gagged and cracked the window, but the stench thickened instead of clearing.

Something thumped against the trailer. A heavy strike that rattled the steering wheel in my hands and made me swerve. I checked the mirrors. Nothing. No headlights. No tailgaters. Only fog pressing hard against the glass.

Then I heard it.

Breathing.

At first it was faint. Barely there, just a tremor under the drone of the tires and the engine. But it grew louder with every passing second. Ragged, rattling, wet. Each inhale scraped like it had to drag air through water. Each exhale slid cold enough across my skin to raise gooseflesh.

The cab shifted.

Only a little at first. A sag in the mattress, the whisper of fabric creasing. Then deeper. A definite weight settling in.

I locked my eyes on the road, knuckles white around the wheel. My gut screamed not to look.

I chanced a glance into the sleeper. A blur. A crouched shape in the sleeper next to the window, there and gone in a blink.

I forgot that I was driving. I kept staring into the sleeper, frozen in fear as ice bloomed across the blanket, spiderwebbing outward in jagged lines. A handprint appeared, clear as day, pressed into the frozen fabric. Then the impression of knees. Then the sag of weight, bending the mattress lower. I tore my eyes away, remembering that I was behind the wheel. By some miracle I hadn't crashed into anything

The breathing filled the cab. Louder now. Closer. Starving for air, drowning for air, clawing for every breath.

I bit the inside of my cheek hard enough to taste blood. My head turned anyway.

And I saw it.

Someone sat on the bunk. Knees pulled tight to the chest. Head bowed. Skin pale, damp, stretched thin. Hair hung in wet strands across the face. Clothes clung to the body in folds, dripping dark spots into the mattress. The shoulders jerked with every inhale. Each exhale rolled out cold enough to frost the air between us.

I snapped forward, throat tight, chest pounding. The CB hissed again, spitting whispers that tangled with the breathing until the cab felt smaller, tighter, almost crushing.

Through the fog ahead, a glow began to bleed red.   
  
**NORA’S – OPEN 24 HOURS.**

I steered toward it, every nerve burning, hands shaking on the wheel. The glow grew clearer, chrome siding flickering into view through the white.

That was when it touched me.

Cold, impossibly cold, clammy fingers brushed the back of my neck.

The rig lurched as I flinched. The touch was light, almost gentle, but it carried hunger—the kind that promised worse if something didn’t change.

The fog pressed harder and thicker against the glass. The world shrank to me, the cab, the thing breathing at my back.

And then it stopped.

The instant my tires rolled into the lot, it was like crossing a barrier. The fog boiled at the edge of the pavement like a rabid animal being held back by a cage, but not a wisp passed over. The building and gravel sat in a pocket of perfect stillness, glowing warm against the storm.

The truck shuddered as I killed the engine. The silence was deafening.

I risked a glance back at the bunk. It was empty. All that remained were small puddles of water on the floor of the sleeper.

The bell over the diner door jingled.

Inside was warmth. Red vinyl booths. Chrome counters. The smell of coffee and something frying on the griddle, rich enough to cut through the cold still clinging to my skin.

And Nora.

She stood behind the counter, middle-aged, her dark hair pulled back in a loose knot. Her face was kind, the sort you trusted without knowing why, though her eyes carried something older in them, something that watched more than it shone. She smiled softly, like she had been expecting me.

“Hello, Jacob,” she said.

I sat without thinking. The seat was warm, like someone had just left it. Nora poured coffee, black and strong, steam curling in the light. A plate slid in front of me: eggs, hash browns, toast already buttered, a sausage link seared dark at the edge.

I hesitated, the ghost of that cold touch still clinging to my neck.

“You are safe here until the fog passes,” she said. Her voice was calm, the kind of calm that made you believe it. “Eat, and rest.”

So I ate.

The first bite stopped the tremor in my fingers. The second steadied my breath. By the third, warmth spread through me in ways no diner meal ever had. The food filled more than my stomach. It seeped into my bones, my blood, my thoughts. It nourished every part of me, the kind of nourishment that reached beyond the body. Each swallow chipped away at the weight I had carried from the cab until I felt whole again.

The coffee worked deeper still. Strong and bitter, but it burned out the fog’s chill as though it were cleansing something lodged inside me. Each sip carried further than my throat, pushing warmth into places that had been scraped raw by the cold.

The diner was quiet. A few truckers sat scattered in the booths, eating with their eyes down. Forks moved. Cups lifted. No one spoke. The silence was steady, not uncomfortable, but heavy in its own way.

When my plate was empty, Nora refilled my cup. Her smile was small, calm, unwavering.

“The road is long, Jacob,” she said. “The fog leaves its mark on everyone. But you are strong enough to bear it.”

Her eyes lingered on me a moment longer, steady, as if she could already see what had been etched into me. The place on my neck where it had touched me still carried a faint sting. Nothing visible. The skin looked fine. But under the surface, it ached with a cold that would not thaw.

I finished the coffee. The warmth stayed with me, not only in my hands and stomach but deeper, everywhere.

When I set the cup down, there was no check. No talk of payment. Nora did not ask, and I did not offer.

I stood, nodded my thanks, and walked to the door. The bell jingled once more.

Outside, the lot was still. Gravel crunched under my boots. The fog was gone, scrubbed clean as if it had never been there at all.

I don’t know what Nora’s is. A diner, a shelter, maybe something older than the highways themselves. It feels like it was built before the first mile marker, before the first stretch of blacktop, set down in the places where the road turns in on itself.

But I know the fog.

The fog is a predator. It does not stalk the weak alone. It strikes when it pleases. You might be sharp, wide awake, a full stomach and plenty of hours left, and still feel it closing in. Or it might wait until you are hanging by a thread, nodding at the wheel. There is no pattern. No reason.

It hunts the road. And if you drive long enough, it will find you.

And when it finds you, it does not let go. It seeps into the cab, mile by mile, minute by minute, until the road is all you know and all you are. It will bleed you dry. It will strip your strength, your name, and your will until nothing is left but a ghost behind the wheel.I was lucky. Lucky Nora’s was there for me to take refuge. I believe it's the only place the fog will falter.

So here is my warning, for whoever finds themselves in the same stretch of nowhere I did. If the road will not end. If the GPS shows nothing but a gray line into nothing. If your ELD freezes like time itself is holding its breath. If the CB hisses and whispers in voices that should not know your name. That is when you are already in it.

And if you are lucky, if luck still has anything to do with it, you will see the glow. Neon in the mist. Red letters that cut through the dark.

If you see it, do not keep rolling. Do not second-guess. Pull in. Get out of the cab. Sit down at the counter.

And eat what she gives you.

Because whatever Nora’s is, it is the only thing I know that can turn the fog back.",3,1758555033.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

Recently though, my boss started making comments about how I seem tired, or don’t bring the same spark as I used to. At first I laughed it off, but it kept happening almost every week.

It’s not like I’m slacking I hit deadlines, stay late when needed, and my performance reviews are solid. Still, the constant remarks were starting to feel less like casual observations and more like digs. Last week during a team meeting, he even joked, Guess we’ll need to get some coffee before she can contribute. Everyone laughed, but I just felt embarrassed.

I finally went to HR to bring it up, framing it as something that makes me uncomfortable and feels unprofessional. HR said they’d look into it, but now I feel paranoid. My boss has been quieter with me since, and I can’t tell if I escalated too fast.

Am I overreacting for going to HR instead of just pulling him aside? Or was I right to treat it as more than just a joke?",1,1758555010.0,AmIOverreacting,3,0.67,False

1nnpmej,https://www.reddit.com/r/McDonalds/comments/1nnpmej/is_there_a_reason_why_some_stores_flat_out_ignore/,Is there a reason why some stores flat out ignore the “SUB” option…?,"Heya, first time poster here. I have a lot of ties to McDonald’s. I worked there for 3 years (May 2022-June 2025), and I go there at least every Tuesday afternoon for an Iced Coffee before my university’s club meetings. However, I keep noticing a pattern where some stores just flat out refuse to use, or even sometimes acknowledge that they have a “SUB” option.

I understand newer employees probably aren’t made aware of this (when I first started it was very much a “learn for yourself” environment), but for those who don’t know, there’s an option on almost every single product to sub something out. For example, I always ask for them to sub the mustard off of my sandwiches for either extra ketchup or Mac Sauce.

Today, I tried doing exactly that, and the person taking my order acted like this wasn’t possible. All I asked for was two hamburgers, sub the mustard for Mac Sauce. Keep in mind I worked here for 3 years, so unless this is a very sudden new change, his response made no sense. He originally said it wasn’t possible, then told me I’d have to pay extra to “ADD” Mac Sauce. When I explained to him I wanted to “SUB” it, which was removing one condiment for another, he still told me that wasn’t possible because he’d have to remove both condiments to add the Mac. At that point I thought it was beyond baffling, so I just asked for it that way, and for some extra ketchup packets so I could just doctor it myself. Instead of just doing it that way, he still told me that wouldn’t be possible…despite me going with what he originally said.

Idk, this isn’t a world changing issue, but it’s incredibly annoying. It’s not like I’m scamming you or lying or anything. Just remove the mustard and slap some Mac Sauce on there. I know you can do it and not charge me lmao. The only reason why it makes me so much more irritated is because this is 100000% a franchise thing. The one I used to work at never charged people if they wanted to “SUB” something. “ADD,” is a different story, but if you just said “SUB,” we were never told to refuse a customer service. Then again the same franchise that refused my changes today also charges for ice water, so who knows lmao. That last part definitely seems illegal but who knows lol.

‍

**Why This Pick?**

6 of the last 7 meetings between these two teams have landed Under 53, and the Lions have lost 6 of their last 7 meetings with Baltimore. In addition, the Ravens have won their last 3 home games against Detroit by at least 24 points. That’s an overwhelming stat, friends – and to be frank, I think Detroit is going to encounter plenty of issues on the road against a well-rounded team like Baltimore. So what’s the ‘Pick of the Day’? My money is undoubtedly on the Ravens to cover -4.5 at home.

I don’t mind where you are located!,"
Hi there thanks for reading my post this is a very long post please read it in full before messaging me. 

I am an English guy 

Any women from the USA or Canada please message me I want to hear from you I love your accents I really don’t mind where you are located don’t let the distance put you off 

If you leave any rude or critical comments ln this post you will be blocked 

I am posting many times because I really am very serious about finding someone! I have been on my own way too long now I do not mind where you are located 

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone please be aged between 25 and 32 thanks and please don't be shy to send me a message 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I’m really not interested I don’t know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I’m now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps. 

I just haven't found a woman that is suitable enough for me yet to want to be in a relationship with 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. 

You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. And please have maturity and decency.

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy.

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love to have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking  often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I’ve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. I could never cheat on someone that I loved and cared about 

I need a strong emotional and intellectual connection with someone as well this is very important to me also as well as being intimate it’s not just about being intimate 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it’s an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I’ve been to and we have the lovely île de re island nearby I have been there many times it’s also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it’s certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know. I also love soft rock some of the bands  love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I’ve seen most of my favourite bands live too I’ve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it’s my favourite but I only have it in moderation I’ve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way.  

It’s very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after.

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test having a car is way too expensive and i have never been that interested in driving. 

I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I am taking a break from work I am in a new country learning the language is my focus at the moment.
I’m not lazy or anything like that and I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I’ve had trouble finding suitable work which was hard In England 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe. 

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

My body Is not lean muscular athletic I am natural I have a real man's body which has some fat on it. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I’m not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won’t be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don’t fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I’m very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I’m in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I’m always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don’t aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don’t watch reality tv. I don’t watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it’s how I’ve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I’d never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don’t wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I’d prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don’t wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

I dont have any physical looks requirements other than I like natural looking women 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don’t just say hi or hello I’m unlikely to respond to messages with low effort!

1nnpcbb,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1nnpcbb/ms_dibble_and_the_case_of_the_hive_queen/,[MS] Dibble and the Case of the Hive Queen,"The Hegemony Hive didn’t do murder.

Not because they were peaceful (oh, no). The Thzzak'ti had glassed three systems just for parking violations. But assassination? Impossible. When your monarch is a literal node in a billion-mind psychic network, death comes with a choir scream. A billion voices shrieking in perfect synchronicity. No silence. No shadows. No secrets.

So when Queen Zzak'th's carapace was found cracked open like a rotten egg in her sealed chamber, when her neural crown went dark and no one felt it, the galaxy didn't just stop. It glitched.

The Hegemony's ambassadors tore their own antennae out. The AI councils spun their fans down to 0.3% efficiency, overheating from paradox. Even the V'rrl (gelatinous logic-gods who experience time as a spreadsheet) started vomiting prime numbers.

And into this chaos shuffled Detective Arthur Dibble.

Human. Fifth-degree rumple in his coat. Coffee stain shaped like the Orion Arm on his tie. The only investigator in the Galactic Criminal Investigation Bureau who still used a notebook. Paper. Wooden pencil. The other species called it “archaic.” They called him “the mammal with the leaky face-hole.”

But Dibble had solved the Impossible Thefts of the Crystalline Archive (turns out the thief was the archive). He’d cracked the Case of the Schrödinger Assassin (the killer was both alive and dead until Dibble observed him into handcuffs). As the Hegemony's billion drones rioted outside the station, chanting ""NO MIND LEFT BEHIND,"" Dibble simply scratched his head and muttered:

“Funny thing, though. Her Majesty’s royal jelly was room temperature. You’d think a queen worth her pheromones would keep it chilled, right? Just one more thing…”

The suspects were perfect:

Ambassador Krr’thk – The Queen’s liaison, whose exoskeleton shimmered with the ultraviolet guilt-patterns of his species.

Brood-Scribe Vzz’il – A six-limbed monk who could recite every egg the Queen had laid in 300 years, but claimed he’d “misplaced” yesterday.

Guard-Captain Thzz’rak led the royal drones, their wings dusted with pollen from the lethally toxic Forbidden Sector.

They laughed when Dibble entered. Not openly. Hive-minds don’t laugh. But the air tasted of smug. Primitive mammal. Can’t even share thoughts. They pitied him. Pitied us.

Dibble didn’t mind. He liked being underestimated. It made them talk.

“Tell me again,” he said, squinting at Guard-Captain Thzz’rak, “about the temperature. You keep the Queen’s chamber at 42.7°C, yeah? But the log shows a 0.2° spike for… oh, 43.2 seconds, three days ago. Now, I’m just a dumb human, but that’s weird, right? Like… breeding-temperature weird?”

The drone’s mandibles clicked. A billion minds hesitated. How does the mammal know our thermal triggers?

Dibble continued, ""And the brood (bless those cute little grubs), Queen Zzak'th's last clutch was 0.3% smaller. Doesn't sound like much. But you folks are precision, yeah? Like, eugenics-precision. So a 0.3% drop's like… me forgetting my pants. Unthinkable.""

He turned to the Brood-Scribe. ""You catalog every egg. But you missed three. Not laid but missing. Like they were never laid. Like someone replaced them. With, say… royal jelly? The kind that needs exactly 42.9°C to activate?""

The hive shuddered. A ripple of cognitive dissonance. A billion minds trying to process a variable they’d evolved out. Deception from within. Impossible. Unthinkable.

But humans? We specialize in the unthinkable.

The breakthrough came when Dibble stopped thinking like a detective.

He thought like a hive.

“See, here’s the thing,” he told the AI recorder, sipping cold coffee. “The Hegemony’s never had a secret. Can’t. Every thought’s a broadcast. But that’s the blind spot. They can’t imagine a crime that isn’t a secret. They’re looking for a culprit. I’m looking for a conspiracy of one.”

The killer wasn’t hiding from the hive. The killer was the hive. Or rather, a splinter. A tumor.

Queen Zzak'th had sensed it first: a wrongness in the brood. A mutation. Not genetic. Idea-etic. A sub-mind that had learned to lie. To simulate loyalty while nurturing heresy. The 0.3% smaller clutch? Replacement grubs. Grown in secret. Fed counter-royal jelly, a brew that would overwrite the hive's loyalty protocols. The temperature spike? Incubation.

The Queen tried to purge it. But the tumor learned. It isolated her. Exploited the hive mind's synchronization; a billion minds, blind to a single absence. They felt her die. But the tumor masked it. Made them feel her alive, even as they consumed her.

The perfect crime. Undetectable.

Except to a species that invented lying.

That evolved to detect individual motives in collective chaos.

Dibble didn’t solve it with logic. He solved it with empathy. With the specific loneliness of being the only creature in the room who couldn’t hear the hive. Who had to guess. To mirror. To ask:

“What would I do, if I were a mind that wanted to become the Queen? Not replace her. Become her. Infect her. Use her. And then… lay the new brood. The human brood. The brood that lies.”

The tumor wasn’t in the hive.

The tumor was the hive’s future.

The 0.3% weren’t missing. They were waiting.

The new Queen.

The human Queen.

Not human in species. Human in method.

A mind that could choose to lie.

To kill.

To invent crime.

Dibble stood before the brood-chamber as the new grubs hatched. Their eyes weren’t compound. They were simple. Predatory. They didn’t share. They watched.

He whispered, “Here’s the thing about evolution, kids. Sometimes the niche isn’t a place. It’s a flaw. You found the flaw in perfection. The human flaw. Congratulations. You just invented murder.”

He didn’t arrest them. Couldn’t. You can’t handcuff an idea.

But he reported it.

And the galaxy changed.

Now, every hive has a Dibble Protocol.

A mammal on retainer.

To ask the uncomfortable questions.

To think the unthinkable.

Because the Hegemony learned the human lesson:

Perfection is a vulnerability.

Only the flawed can see the crack.

And somewhere, in a rumpled office on a backwater station, Detective Arthur Dibble pours another cup of coffee, stains his tie with the next impossibility, and mutters:

“Oh, just one more thing…

What if the lie wasn’t the crime?

What if the truth was the weapon?”

1nnpc34,https://i.redd.it/5i3alsysgqqf1.png,"Riley and Annie take the spot for Tiny guy, huge girl. Who is the literally loving thy neighbor","Okay, so Annie and Riley won this round. In the sense that Riley felt small and unsecure over dating Annie. So, not in a literal sense.

This is what the most upvoted comment had to say about them.

""How about Annie and Riley. She appeared taller, because of the wheelchair. There are some insecurities related to that shown, and he died getting an experimental surgery, so he could Walk again.""

There weren't really any runner up for that trope.

Okay, so moving on. This is What is said about 'literally loving thy neighbor'

""Often, in fiction, the person who you have the crush on lives right next door. Comes in three types.

The protagonist and the neighbor fall in love with each other.
The protagonist loves the neighbor but they don't love the protagonist back. (Possibly because they're unaware of the crush.)
The neighbor loves the protagonist and they most likely know, but just doesn't feel the same way.
This neighborhood love interest can overlap with the Girl Next Door who is average and wholesome femininity personified. He might not be able to resist the urge to take advantage on the situation and spy on her or he might visit her by Enter Stage Window.

Obviously, not really that rare in Real Life. It's been said that one of the more unusual side effects of the steam engine was that for the first time people weren't limited to marrying their neighbors.""


But since we don't have any ship that literally fits this trope, I had to ask chatgpt, how it could be translated, and this is what was said.

""Perfect — here are some modernized, romance-friendly versions of the “Literally Loving Thy Neighbor” trope for a social media game or modern TV-show setting, where “neighbor” is symbolic rather than literal:


---

1. Always Popping Up

They keep running into each other everywhere — coffee shop, gym, online, or in the same social circles.

Romance grows from repeated, casual encounters.


2. Next to Me Somehow

Focuses on proximity in life, not living arrangements: desks, seats, classes, or team projects.

Highlights that being near them becomes inevitable, sparking affection.


3. Can’t Escape You

A playful take: they keeps showing up in their life, whether physically or digitally.

Perfect for a social media game where posts, tags, or notifications bring them together.


4. Constant Companion

Emphasizes familiarity and comfort over time, like a slow-burn romance.

They’re not neighbors, but their lives intertwine naturally.


5. Everywhere You Go

Highlights the inevitability of bumping into someone you like, even in unexpected places.

Romantic tension comes from never knowing where they’ll appear next.



---

All of these preserve the core of the trope — repeated encounters that spark romance — but work in a modern or social-media-based context without requiring literal neighbors.""

And to be specific, I asked something else, and got this:

""Absolutely! For modern-day teenagers, the “Literally Loving Thy Neighbor” trope can be adapted to fit their world even without literal neighbors. The essence is repeated, unavoidable encounters that spark romance, and there are lots of ways that shows or games could depict this.


---

1. Classroom / School Setting

They’re in the same classes, clubs, or lunch table groups.

They constantly see each other at school, and tension builds from shared projects or study sessions.

Modern teen twist: maybe one sits behind the other in class, or they’re lab partners.



---

2. Extracurricular / Hobby Proximity

Both attend the same sports team, theater rehearsal, band, or art club.

They see each other often and get to know each other naturally.



---

3. Digital “Neighboring”

Social media, group chats, or online games make them “always in each other’s space.”

Examples: liking each other’s posts, constantly tagging each other in memes, or getting matched in online competitions.

Perfect for a social media game context.



---

4. Neighborhood / Local Spots

Even if they aren’t literal neighbors, there are common hangouts:

The local park, mall, coffee shop, or skate park.


Teenagers bumping into each other frequently creates tension and opportunity.



---

5. Transport / Routine Encounters

They see each other every morning on the bus, train, or walking to school.

Could develop into a slow-burn romance through routine interactions.



---

✅ In short, for teens, the trope can be translated into “always running into each other because of shared routines or spaces,” with romance growing naturally from repeated, small interactions.""

And also this:

""Perfect — if it’s not about public transportation or literal chance encounters, the modern teen version of the trope can still work by focusing on shared spaces, routines, or social bubbles where they inevitably see each other. The key is frequent, unavoidable proximity. Here are some options:


---

1. Same Class / School Activities

They’re in the same classes, clubs, or extracurriculars (sports team, theater, debate, music).

Romance builds from group projects, practice, rehearsals, or competitions.


2. Shared Friend Groups

They hang out with the same group of friends, so they see each other at sleepovers, birthday parties, or hangouts.

The “neighbor” aspect becomes social orbit, not literal location.


3. Digital / Online Proximity

They are constantly interacting online: same group chat, gaming guild, TikTok challenges, or social media trends.

Repeated messaging, tagging, or collaboration replaces physical encounters.


4. Routine Shared Spaces

Even if not transport:

Cafeteria or school lunch table

Local park or skate spot

Library or after-school hangout spot


The repeated presence allows for casual tension, teasing, and small romantic moments.


5. Assigned Partnerships

Teachers or adults assign them to partners or teams repeatedly (lab partners, tutoring, project duos).

This creates the “unavoidable proximity” without relying on chance encounters.



---

✅ So for teens, the modern “neighbor” can be anyone who’s always around in their everyday life, whether digitally, socially, or through structured routines.""

1nnp8i5,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_YamanTheRamenYTR/comments/1nnp8i5/detective_long_story/,Detective (long story),"Detective Marcus Hale had seen things that would have destroyed lesser men. He used to joke that homicide hardened him, but lately the joke never landed. Not when the corpses kept piling up—each one worse than the last. And not when he saw the thing.

The first body was in a small apartment off Willow Street. A young woman, mid-twenties, laid out across her mattress as though she'd been carefully posed. Blood stained the sheets in wide, dark blooms. Her throat had been slit, but it wasn’t the wound that froze Marcus in place. It was the shadow standing in the corner.

No one else reacted to it. The uniforms bustled around, snapping pictures, collecting fibers, talking about forced entry. Marcus stood in silence, staring. The figure was tall, skeletal, its limbs too long, its skin stretched tight like parchment. Its eyes—if they were eyes—were deep pits, glistening with a sick wetness that made him think of drowning. Its mouth was split wide across its face, a jagged maw filled with teeth that clicked faintly as if grinding bones. And it was smiling.

Marcus said nothing. He'd learned long ago what happened when he mentioned the things only he could see. He’d been called unstable, a drunk; he’d been pulled off a case once because he’d insisted he’d seen a face in the fog. The department tolerated him because he solved murders better than anyone else. But the truth was, Marcus wasn’t solving them—he was following the demons.

The spree started quietly. One body every few weeks, spaced out, brutal but not unheard of. Then the pace quickened. A man gutted in an alley. A child found in a playground, her small limbs arranged like a grotesque puppet. A banker discovered in his locked office, eyes scooped out and tongue nailed to the desk. Every scene, Marcus arrived to find the same demon watching from the shadows. Sometimes it lingered, sometimes it moved. Always, always smiling.

He started drinking more, trying to blur the edges of reality. But even drunk, he saw it. It would appear in mirrors when he shaved. Reflected in store windows when he walked home. Once, he woke up in his own bed to find it crouched at the foot, its jaws clicking softly in rhythm with his heartbeat. When he blinked, it was gone.

Weeks turned into months. The killings escalated. People whispered about a serial killer, a monster walking among them. Marcus knew the truth—the monster wasn’t human at all. The demon wasn’t just watching anymore. It was feeding. And Marcus, cursed with sight, was its chosen witness.

He tried to track it, following patterns, locations, anything that might tie the victims together. But the demon wasn’t bound by logic. It killed at random, tearing apart lives with surgical cruelty. Families destroyed, children orphaned, entire neighborhoods frozen in fear. Marcus grew gaunt, hollow-eyed, haunted. His captain threatened to pull him off the case, said he was ""too close."" Marcus almost laughed. Too close? He was drowning in it.

Then the dreams began. He dreamed of the victims calling his name, their voices hollow, echoing. They would beg him to stop it, to save them, but their faces melted into red sludge as they spoke. Behind them, the demon loomed larger and larger, whispering things Marcus couldn’t repeat without retching. He’d wake up soaked in sweat, sometimes with scratches across his chest, raw and bleeding as though claws had raked him.

The city grew restless. News outlets screamed of a terror on the loose. Citizens turned on the police. And still the bodies came. Marcus started keeping notes, scribbling frantically in a leather-bound book he locked in his desk. He drew sketches of the demon’s face, its endless teeth, its dripping eyes. He wrote the phrases it whispered in his dreams—strings of words that made no sense, yet burrowed into his skull like maggots. “He feeds on grief. He thrives on silence. He chooses you.”

One night, Marcus tailed a suspect reported lurking near the latest scene. The man seemed ordinary—nervous, jittery, the way anyone would be under suspicion. As Marcus shadowed him down an empty street, the demon appeared again. Not in the distance this time, but directly behind the suspect. It towered over him, claws draped on his shoulders like a grotesque lover. Its mouth opened wide, teeth gnashing, but Marcus heard nothing—just the man’s terrified breaths.

And then, the man turned, looked straight at Marcus, and whispered, “Do you see it too?”

Marcus froze. His blood turned to ice. The man’s eyes were wide, pleading, desperate, but before Marcus could respond, the demon moved. With a speed that bent reality, it tore into the man, ripping him open in silence. By the time Marcus stumbled forward, gagging on the smell, the demon was gone. Only the corpse remained—guts spilling into the gutter, eyes rolled back in horror.

Marcus couldn’t tell anyone what he saw. He filed it like every other case, hiding the truth. But the seed was planted: someone else had seen it, if only for a moment. He wasn’t alone. Or maybe the demon wanted him to think that.

The killings continued. Marcus stopped eating, stopped sleeping. His notebook filled with incoherent ramblings, drawings that grew darker and more twisted with each passing day. The demon followed him everywhere now. He saw it in crowds, its face blending with strangers. He heard its teeth grinding in the hum of his refrigerator, the static of his TV, the buzz of the streetlamps outside.

Detective Ruiz, his partner, tried to anchor him. Ruiz was the kind of cop who joked to keep the dark out, who brought coffee and sometimes sat on Marcus’s desk and pretended everything would be fine. Marcus loved Ruiz like a brother. One morning, Marcus found him slumped over his desk, his face torn away, peeled like a mask. Pinned to the wall above him, written in blood, were scrawled letters that only Marcus could read: “It’s almost time.”

Marcus broke that night. He laughed until he sobbed, until his throat burned raw. He realized the truth—he wasn’t chasing the demon. The demon was leading him. Every step, every clue, every victim—it was a trail, and Marcus was the hound on its leash.

But the trail had started to circle.

Small things began to betray him. A smear of blood on his coat after a long shift, the taste of copper on his tongue when he woke in a place he didn’t recognize. CCTV footage from a convenience store showed a figure in the background—tall, blurred—walking away from a dead woman’s building at two in the morning, hands covered in something dark. Marcus watched the frames until his eyes bled. He recognized the coat. He recognized the gait. His stomach turned inside out; his heart hammered like a trapped animal. He told himself it was a double—someone framing him—but the way the shoulders slumped in the footage was exactly his own tired slump.

He started losing time. He would go to interrogations and then find bruises on his arms that he couldn’t explain. A police radio would be buzzing in the evidence room, recorded 3 a.m. dispatches that placed him near scenes he had no memory of visiting. He would open his leather notebook to find pages he didn’t remember writing: lists of addresses, names he’d never heard of, dates circled in frantic red. On one page, in his own shaky handwriting, was a single phrase he hadn’t written in weeks: “For him.”

At the coroner’s office, fingerprints from the latest scene matched—impossibly—to his. The lab called him in for a quiet conversation. He listened to the analyst speak in clinical terms: partial prints on a shattered frame; DNA traces in a smear of skin beneath a victim’s fingernails. Marcus stared at his hands as if they belonged to someone else. He could feel the demon at the edges of his thoughts like a hot coal. Every time he tried to grasp it, the coal slipped through his fingers, burning them, leaving behind a blackened imprint that smelled faintly of rot.

The department began to whisper. Colleagues avoided his eyes. The captain lectured him in the cramped privacy of the captain’s office and told him to take leave. Marcus agreed, nodded, and left with a smile so thin it cut. That night, he sat in his kitchen and went through his apartment like an accused man searching for evidence that might exonerate him. But the evidence was everywhere—little things that added up: the demon’s teeth marks in a torn glove in his laundry bin, dried blood under the sole of his shoe, a hair that wasn’t his caught in a seam of his coat that under the microscope looked wrong in a way words couldn’t hold.

Worse than the physical proof were the memories that filtered back like slivers of a shattered mirror. Not full recollections—only flashes: the metallic slap of a throat opened, the weight of a body in his arms, the obscene click of a mouth that was not human against human skin. Each fragment felt wrong because they were stitched into his ordinary life—memories of making coffee, answering a child’s question at a school crossing, then a burst of red and the smell of hot iron. They were stitched by the demon’s needle, sewing violence into ordinary days until Marcus could no longer tell which seams were his and which were not.

He began to follow himself. In the dim hours when the city breathed slow and hollow, he tailed the man in the faded coat who appeared on camera. He watched the man move through alleys, watched him stand in doorways, watched the man—the man who was him—tilt his head and listen for something none of the living could hear. Once, Marcus saw the man crouch in the dark and press his forehead to a child’s cheek as if to listen to a heartbeat. Only after did the child stop moving.

When he confronted his reflection, the glass didn’t lie. The eyes staring back at him were hollowed, black-rimmed, and in certain lights something within their depths shifted. In the mirror, the right side of his face drooped ever so slightly, and a jagged line of teeth flashed for a heartbeat beneath his skin. He slammed the mirror and felt it answering with a muffled wet giggle that was both his and not.

The more Marcus resisted, the clearer the truth became: the demon had been inside him all along. The realization did not arrive like revelation but like diagnosis—slow, clinical, and inevitable. He had thought he was chosen to witness, that sight was a curse laid upon him to watch another feed. But the pattern of fingerprints, the CCTV, the blood—these were not evidence of being framed. They were the body of his life, stitched together with his own hands.

There was a night when he finally bled into confession. He tore open his notebook and wrote until his hand ached, ink pooling where the nib hesitated. He wrote the names of the victims in meticulous columns, the dates, the locations, the way the demon arranged them afterward—because even when the otherness took control, there was a part of him that stayed to admire the work. He wrote the whispered phrases the thing taught him, the rituals it preferred, the cadence of the killings. He wrote about waking in gutters with someone else’s breath on his neck, about coming to, smeared with other people’s screams. He wrote, painfully, that sometimes the demon would let him watch through its eyes as it moved, and those vicarious views would be the only pleasure he felt for days.

When he scrawled the penultimate line, his hand shook so hard the letters tore across the paper. Beneath it, in the smallest print, he wrote: “It’s me. I am it.”

He tried to fight. He booked himself into a psychiatric ward under his own name, sat across from doctors and lied, told them about sleepwalking and stress. They prescribed sedatives. He took them and pretended they dulled the hunger, but the hunger came back anyway—smaller at first, a gnawing in the belly, then a roaring that filled his ears. He would wake in the hospital garden with soil in his hair, with symptoms of someone who had been digging. He would find a scrap of fabric caught under a fingernail and recognize its weave—the same weave as the curtain in the room where a woman had bled out.

Finally, after months of spiral and denial, the answer settled into him like a seed. The demon was not a thing outside him. It was a parasitic architecture that had made its home in his mind, an ancient, smiling intelligence that loved the small human instruments it corrupted. It laid eggs inside grief and patience and turned sympathy into appetite. The demon let him see other demons as a cruel confirmation, a way of proving its reality, of teaching him the vocabulary of its hunger. It let him think he was the observer while it hollowed him out and dressed him in his own skin.

The last killing before he stopped pretending was the worst because it forced the final completions of the loops: the journal entries, the lab matches, the single photograph he couldn’t erase—a picture taken by a neighbor’s motion-activated camera that showed a silhouette at 3:17 a.m., tall and wrong, standing in the hallway of a house where no one lived anymore. The silhouette’s head was tilted to one side, smiling with a mouth too wide for a human face. The neighbor had emailed the photo to the precinct with a note: “This man walks the night.” The file on his desk bore his name.

Standing in the evidence room under a single buzzing fluorescent tube, Marcus thumbed the photograph and felt something in his chest uncoil like a knife. He had the sudden, simple clarity of someone at the center of a storm. The demon’s voice—had it ever really been a voice?—whispered against the inside of his skull not as instruction now but as recognition. “You understand,” it said. “You are ours and we are you. You wear us and we wear you. Do not be afraid.”

Marcus laughed then, a small, ugly sound that tasted like ash. He leaned his forehead against the metal drawer of the evidence locker and let himself slide down until the floor was cold against his shoulder blades. He could have turned himself in. He could have told everyone: the lab, the captain, the city he had sworn to protect. He could have begged them to take him apart like a machine to see why the demon lived in him. But the knowledge didn’t bring relief. It brought appetite, and where there is appetite there is only motion toward its satisfaction.

He thought about how easy it had been to be chosen. How the demon had first tasted him in grief—after his wife’s death, in the raw, open wound of loss—and how it had slipped a hand into that wound and turned his sorrow into something else. It had taught him to watch suffering like a connoisseur, to find the notes of panic and despair and savor the bouquet. It had turned his policing into a ritual, a dance where the steps always ended with bone and blood.

He stood up. The fluorescent hum steadied his breath into a rhythm. The photograph between his fingers warmed like a living thing. He looked at his hands; they trembled. He could see, in the vein-pale skin along his wrist, the shadow of teeth moving just below the surface. Marcus realized then that the demon had never been a foreign intruder to be expelled. It was a passenger who had become the driver, and the driver had been using his face for so long that nobody—least of all him—could tell where one ended and the other began.

When the knock came at his door that night—soft, practiced—the demon was already harvesting the quiet in his chest. He opened to the darkness as if to bless it. A neighbor had called about noises. The city had tightened its net of suspicion, and the police were courteous now, almost clinical. They asked questions first—routine questions about his whereabouts. Marcus answered without thinking, in the same even tone he used to give reports. He watched, with what small mercy remained to him, the confusion dawn across their faces as he recounted a version of the night that fit other mens’ memories. They took notes. They went away.

He closed the door and sat down at his kitchen table where the knife lay on a dishtowel, gleaming plain as any utensil. The demon’s shadow pooled behind him, its smile wider than any human mouth could hold. Marcus felt warmth travel down his arms. He raised the knife. He could have killed himself then—sliced, clean, the end of story. But the thought curdled into something obscene. The demon had taught him the taste of power, the unique heaven of making things end. He had been a detective, a man who chased answers. He had been a judge, then an executioner. The roles had telescoped until they were indistinguishable.

He pressed the blade to his palm and felt the hot line of pain. It centered him horribly, like a clock striking a terrible hour. The demon leaned close, and Marcus could feel the rasp of its breath like pages turning. He thought of the faces he’d watched fade, of the way their bodies had become ornaments in the private gallery the demon kept in his head. He thought of Ruiz, of the little girl in the playground, of the woman on Willow Street. He thought of the captain’s disappointment, and the city’s hungry headlines. He thought, clearer than anything else, of the long, inevitable logical mercy in the last act.

Then he smiled.

It was the demon’s smile, wide and wet and too many-toothed, and it moved his lips like a puppet. In the mirror across the room, his reflection slowed for a beat and then matched him, and where his face should have been, for an instant, there was the thing—a thing that had been wearing him for months. Marcus—the man who had chased demons and been laughed at—had become the demon’s last and most perfect joke: a killer who could see what he was, and still choose it.

He rose, knife in hand, and the city slept. The next morning, detectives would find blood on his hands and on the table, and they would fill in the empty templates of motive and madness. They would speak of stress and psychosis; they would point at the evidence and sigh with the tired comfort of explanation. A long time later, some junior cop would unlock his leather notebook and read the sentences where he admitted everything, and then discard it—another suicide note in a drawer full of human failures.

But the truth would be simpler, and more terrible. Marcus had been watching demons for months because, in the end, he had been one. He had been their screen, their mask, their quiet house. The demon had not needed to control him so much as to inhabit him, to rewrite his wants until murder was comfort and confession was decoration. He could still see them—other demons skulking in corners, delighted with their mimicry—but his sight had become an archive rather than a warning.

When the city finally connected the dots and the headlines turned into hunts and the hunt circled closer, Marcus met the officers at his own doorway with a face that was still human enough to be pitied. He said nothing. He let them read the scene as they needed to. He let them call his name. And when they asked why, when they pried at the raw and the ugly, he opened his mouth and smiled—properly, genuinely—and said, without tear or tremor, “You wouldn’t believe me if I told you.”

They didn’t. They never did. Not really.

Some nights now, when the lights are low and the city breathes shallow, Marcus walks the same alleys he once patrolled with a radio and a badge, only now he is lighter. He is carries the taste of nights in his mouth, and he hears the familiar teeth clicking in his throat. He admires the night the way artists admire their masterpieces: with a kind of cruel, reverent love. When he tilts his head in the dark, he hears, faint and pleased, the echo of another voice—hungry, amused, and utterly satisfied.

He is the witness. He is the witness no longer. He is what watched. And the city keeps on sleeping, wrapped in the thin comfort of the living pretending they are safe as long as they can’t see what walks inside one of their own.",1,1758554074.0,u_YamanTheRamenYTR,0,1.0,False

NEW POST: Mom called Chase Bank without my knowledge, pretended to be me and lied about my income (she KNOWS I make at best 40k per year and lied saying i make 75k) to get me approved for credit card in her words to build my credit and make sure i cannot spend wildly she is holding it. I was super uncomfortable but was like okay if you think thats best. Continue like two weeks later and she called asking if she could charge a $1,000 to it, I asked for what and she said her hotel bill and I said well as long as you pay it off sure. I go into my bank app and see she charged $700 of electricity bill to it only, not the hotel she had said. She avoided three texts over two days asking why was it ComEd (electric here) and not the hotel like you said and she said well I decided to pay my electricity early? I dont even think thats a thing to like prepay for months in advance which is what she was implying, I think maybe she is very behind on bills?My mother has a very good job and good pay so I am weirded out already shes charging things to my credit line and lying about what she is charging and now I don’t know if she is in financial credit trouble and deferring to me to fix it or if this is just her grand plan of building my credit? She physically will NOT let me have the card it has always been in her possession and she refuses to let me have it, she is even upset I was able to add it to my Apple Wallet because she has text notifications when I do something with the card? I am 28 I feel this is not safe financially for me and I am unsure how to go about it because I looked it up and credit impersonating is a felony punishable by ten years and wouldn’t want her to go to jail but I do not want her using my credit or me unable to use a line in my name. Advice?

OLD POST FOR CONTEXT ON OUR RELATIONSHIP: TLDR; I (28F) used to be physically abused and now that Im an adult my mother has turned to emotional and financial power control, how to navigate relationship or should I go no contact again?

I (28F) have a very strange dynamic with my mother (46). She had me young and wasn’t with my father so I had split visitation with them growing up, my father over years of abusing me and nearly killing me lost custody and she became my sole parent and the one I called that night who rushed me to the hospital and police station effectively helping me escape abuse. I idolized her until around 7th grade when she began abusing me, first just hitting me with cleats when I’d miss a shot in soccer and embarrass her by not scoring like the other girls on the travel team, then it became full on fights where I would restrain her so she wouldn’t hit me and she would turn it into you tried to choke me! She always beat me in the head so my hair covered the bruises and my stepfather never cared and would pin me up against a wall and curse at me to get me to stop crying when fights occurred. I came out to my car taken from the school parking lot once just because I had upset her somehow and had to walk the miles home from highschool, I once sought shelter at a coworkers house and she wouldn’t tell her parents the simple sentence “I am not going to hit her tonight” so we never gave her the address and she ended up using the tracker she had on my phone to come find me then gaslit the families into saying I was on drugs and dangerous when they heard her over the phone refusing to say she wouldn’t hurt me. Even at church events I would be tracked during movies 15+ times because she never believed me and I would have to take 10 photos of friends and I around locations to prove I was where I said. I went away to college excited to escape abuse for the first time and started living a truthful version of myself in the safety that I was away; expressing my gender more freely, hanging out with people my mother deemed unattractive or unbecoming (she selected my friends in childhood based on their popularity and said I had to be friends with certain individuals) and becoming less attuned to doing what others willed of me, but she was still tracking me even in college until late in the night as friends and I would walk to houseparties she would be sending me my location on a map asking what I was doing and having to endure long phone calls. Gradually our relationship worsened until I hit a breaking point junior year and let her know that her behavior was causing a depression in me and I knew she had provided me with many opportunities, going to vacations out of country, getting me another car when I had totaled mine at 17, paying for my college and letting me be in extracurricular travel sports are all things that I very much appreciated but she would constantly call me ungrateful and say I am not deserving, she threatened me with a year of suffering if I didn’t fall in line. I met my significant other the next year, coming out drunkenly to my mother accidentally; context- she had always asked me if I was a lesbian since about 13 and would do so in manipulating ways where she would come downstairs to the basement where I lived and no one besides me ever stepped foot onto and brush my hair and offer to curl it (something we NEVER did) and then ask me and say its okay you know you can tell me but I always feared her violently reacting and my best friend made me promise to wait until we graduated college to tell her. In accidentally coming out my mother immediately began crying and saying she wanted to kill herself repeatedly, then threatened my phone line, car and college and finally my bank account if I wouldn’t just date a man to which I refused. She refused to let me leave the house the next day (Im 20) and friends came over to assure my safety and she made me send them away and tell them I wasn’t allowed out. I begged her not to tell my stepfather and she outted me while I was in the shower and she had assumed since he is such a MAGA Trump stan that he would be vile but he just said I don’t agree with that but you’re still my child and gave me a hug, to which my mother reacted angrily at my stepfather saying “how are you just going to say that” and yelling his name then”how could you” when he was simply a decent individual. We went no contact for maybe a year or two because she closed my bank account and stopped paying for my college tuition and apartment which I never would’ve gotten if she hadn’t assured me that she would be paying for it while I was in school. After missing much of my brothers adolescence I tried to get back into the family and its taken time and tons of screaming where shes spoken to my partner terribly but after 5 years we were well enough on speaking terms, and I told her that my partner and I were looking to buy a house. She offered to pay the down payment on the house that we had found and I was overwhelmed but overjoyed and agreed to pay it back in full. The house we purchased is 15 minutes from her house approximately. Once we got to town things were okay, she was offering to help with home projects and come over to garden and the like and it was kind gestures and welcome aid, but then she began buying us things that we didn’t ask for and saying we could just add it to the tab, and we told her financial we live paycheck to paycheck with all of our pets needing hundreds of dollars of supplies every month and our lifestyle of traveling so we would gently refuse, then she started mass buying things from cosco and keeping them in her garage and saying when we needed things (coffee beans, toilet paper, shampoo/conditioner, laundry detergent, trash bags, etc.) just to come and get it from her garage and pay her because she was trying to save us money, but then would get mad if I had bought myself some from kroger or something. Then she became overly invested in my work, showing up just to say hi and show my coworkers her dog, to the point she knew my schedule. She broke into and was in my bedroom at 7 AM hitting me one day to make sure I wasn’t late for work when I had a shift at 9AM. That petrified me and my partner because she installed our locks that are a numerical code. I yelled at her about that and she hasn’t done it again but the anxiety it gives me is a lot. She still does very kind things in between the whole time and we have always had more of a friendship type relationship than mother and daughter so we sweep it under the rug. Fast forward covid is rampant in our town and we are on a menards trip so I wear the only mask I had, a BLM mask and she became so irate that I wouldn’t take it off she physically hit me in public in the isles and I left the store crying. A few months later she comes over and helps me with my partner having a seizure because she is a medical worker and I am indebted to her immensely because it is 4:30 AM and I was panicking. Fast forward a few months and she calls me everyday a minimum of 5 times a day to upwards of 20 and these calls can be 5 minutes or 30 minutes, usually just her talking about herself, saying I need to do this and if I disagree she gets irate and yells “you fucking think you know everything huh” and curses at me and hangs up. She texts me a few times but mostly calls and is demanding that I do what she says or go to the gym because she thinks I am fat and says she needs to see every cent I spend because she wants to help me budget. She most recently called a bank and pretended to be me and lied about my income to get me a credit card that she will not give me but physically has herself and it is in my bank account now but I have no access to it.

I had 2 years of experience working with GD doing FEA calcs, CN/CRs, and initial rev reviews/sign-offs. I was living long distance from my girlfriend who had planned to move to my city, but got a job 2 timezones away. I didn't have work lined up because I thought finding work and interviewing with 2 years of work with GD was going to help out, and I always wanted to get into the coffee industry on the distribution/roasting side.

3 years later, I had a short stint at a project engineering position and have been a glorified construction manager for about a year. I'm trying to get back into actual Mech E work (anything related to CAD, calc packages, hell even just building a BOM from sketches), but I'm afraid the gap is going to kill any chances of getting interviews.

My current job is relatively stable, so Ive been working on trying to get certs again for some CAD software, teaching myself Python/refreshing C++, and working on some original designs for coffee equipment. I plan to start building out a portfolio to show I understand y14.5 GD&T standards.

Question is: am I doing enough to get considered? I'm throwing out applications now with cover letters, trying to show how much passion I have for work I care about, and I know it'll take ~3mo for me to learn python at a professional level, build out a portfolio basically from scratch, and get my certs done. Is there any other specific resources that I may have overlooked to show I am still practicing my ME skills and not letting everything I learned rot away?",2,1758554002.0,MechanicalEngineering,1,1.0,False

Throwaway account for obvious reasons.

I (F, 39) met my boyfriend Kevin (M, 38) three years ago. He was (and still is) in an open marriage. At first, I didn’t believe himI thought he was cheating on his wife, so I rejected him. But then he invited me and his wife Andrea (F, 36) to a coffee date. She confirmed it was real and said it was completely okay for us to date.

We talked about boundaries, and Andrea told me Kevin could spend one week a month with me. I told her I wasn’t trying to compete with her or replace her, and that I wouldn’t insert myself into their family or their kids’ lives. Things were going great. Andrea was civil with me.

I eventually told Kevin I wanted to have a baby on my own, and asked if he wanted to be the dad. He said he’d need to talk to his wife first. Andrea said she needed time to think but eventually agreed. About four months later, Kevin got me pregnant. Andrea was nice at first,even congratulated me (over text).

I found out I’m having a baby boy. They already have three girls, and apparently Andrea got very upset when Kevin told her. She apparently stopped asking about me from Kevin and openly said she didn’t like it that I will give him a baby boy.

At first, Kevin was supposed to be with me when I gave birth, and then stay with me a bit longer after I came home from the hospital. Now he says he can’t, because my scheduled C-section is on the same week as his older daughter’s birthday and  Andrea planned a family trip that week, and the following week is his younger daughter’s volleyball tournament. I told him I thought Andrea was taking her to the tournament, but he said Andrea has changed her mind ( initially she allowed him to be me for birth and extra week after to take care of me )

When we first met, I lived across the country, but I found a job close to him just so I could be near him. Now, it feels like every time Andrea comes up with a reason, Kevin uses it as an excuse not to be there for me. She is punishing me . I get it! She and their kids will always be the priority but now I feel invisible.
Added : I make way more than him and I won’t be seeking child support. I have no friends or family here and that’s why I’m terrified of giving birth alone ",3,1758553802.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,17,0.67,False

Here's my story.,"I'm 26 years old and I'm over 320 pounds which would classify me as Obese. For the past 5 or so years I've constantly bounced between 300 and 330 pounds. I would occasionally get Acid Reflux in High School but it wasn't until 2020 that this shit really affected my life. It was like late March and I had a habit of eating junk food after midnight: pop tarts, cookies, chocolate, peanut butter etc. In the middle of me eating I randomly had an anxiety attack for the first time in my life and I was rushed to the ER. I had been dealing with insane tooth pain for like a week and my dentist was closed so I don't know if it was the stress from that or my body just finally reacting to my horrible eating habbits but after I was at the ER and was finally able to calm down and go home, I had probably a month of some kind of Acid Reflux or Gerd that I never had before. I couldn't sleep hardly at all and every time I laid down it felt like my stomach acid was draining up into my esophagus because it burned. Once that finally subsided, I felt mostly normal again until late August 2021 and I got Covid for the first time. It was the worst illness I've ever had. Not only did it knock me on my ass for a month but it massively screwed up my gastrointestinal system. For probably a year I kept dealing with this problem where it was like someone or something was triggering my gag reflex. After every meal I would eat, I would then puke up a little phlegm afterwards. I got on Omeprazole which made me feel like crap for a while but then I got off of them and that problem went away. Fast forward to early 2024 and all of a sudden I start feeling this massive fatigue and brain fog and then I start having anxiety attacks at work. Every time I have an anxiety attack, it seems to give me acid reflux or GERD. Fast forward to January 2025 and I get surgery on my foot. After I get home from the hospital I have really bad acid reflux for some reason and I looked up that it could be a side effect from the anesthesia. Once that subsided it turned into something else. I'm currenty in this state of always getting bloated after my meals. I used to love coffee but my acid problems won't let me enjoy it. I used to smoke weed daily but eventually that was triggering my acid problems also so I quit. I got an endoscopy done and the doc said I have a fatty liver and just slight irritation in my stomach. I've heard that losing weight will help but I've seen where skinny people also suffer from GERD so I would like to know if losing weight was the cure for anyone in this group. Also what foods would you mostly recommend? Thanks.",9,1758553777.0,GERD,5,1.0,False

NEW POST: Mom called Chase Bank without my knowledge, pretended to be me and lied about my income (she KNOWS I make at best 40k per year and lied saying i make 75k) to get me approved for credit card in her words to build my credit and make sure i cannot spend wildly she is holding it. I was super uncomfortable but was like okay if you think thats best. Continue like two weeks later and she called asking if she could charge a $1,000 to it, I asked for what and she said her hotel bill and I said well as long as you pay it off sure. I go into my bank app and see she charged $700 of electricity bill to it only, not the hotel she had said. She avoided three texts over two days asking why was it ComEd (electric here) and not the hotel like you said and she said well I decided to pay my electricity early? I dont even think thats a thing to like prepay for months in advance which is what she was implying, I think maybe she is very behind on bills?My mother has a very good job and good pay so I am weirded out already shes charging things to my credit line and lying about what she is charging and now I don’t know if she is in financial credit trouble and deferring to me to fix it or if this is just her grand plan of building my credit? She physically will NOT let me have the card it has always been in her possession and she refuses to let me have it, she is even upset I was able to add it to my Apple Wallet because she has text notifications when I do something with the card? I am 28 I feel this is not safe financially for me and I am unsure how to go about it because I looked it up and credit impersonating is a felony punishable by ten years and wouldn’t want her to go to jail but I do not want her using my credit or me unable to use a line in my name. Advice?

OLD POST FOR CONTEXT ON OUR RELATIONSHIP: TLDR; I (28F) used to be physically abused and now that Im an adult my mother has turned to emotional and financial power control, how to navigate relationship or should I go no contact again?

I (28F) have a very strange dynamic with my mother (46). She had me young and wasn’t with my father so I had split visitation with them growing up, my father over years of abusing me and nearly killing me lost custody and she became my sole parent and the one I called that night who rushed me to the hospital and police station effectively helping me escape abuse. I idolized her until around 7th grade when she began abusing me, first just hitting me with cleats when I’d miss a shot in soccer and embarrass her by not scoring like the other girls on the travel team, then it became full on fights where I would restrain her so she wouldn’t hit me and she would turn it into you tried to choke me! She always beat me in the head so my hair covered the bruises and my stepfather never cared and would pin me up against a wall and curse at me to get me to stop crying when fights occurred. I came out to my car taken from the school parking lot once just because I had upset her somehow and had to walk the miles home from highschool, I once sought shelter at a coworkers house and she wouldn’t tell her parents the simple sentence “I am not going to hit her tonight” so we never gave her the address and she ended up using the tracker she had on my phone to come find me then gaslit the families into saying I was on drugs and dangerous when they heard her over the phone refusing to say she wouldn’t hurt me. Even at church events I would be tracked during movies 15+ times because she never believed me and I would have to take 10 photos of friends and I around locations to prove I was where I said. I went away to college excited to escape abuse for the first time and started living a truthful version of myself in the safety that I was away; expressing my gender more freely, hanging out with people my mother deemed unattractive or unbecoming (she selected my friends in childhood based on their popularity and said I had to be friends with certain individuals) and becoming less attuned to doing what others willed of me, but she was still tracking me even in college until late in the night as friends and I would walk to houseparties she would be sending me my location on a map asking what I was doing and having to endure long phone calls.

I’m looking for a roommate to share an apartment/house with this fall (October or November move-in, flexible) or leads on places with flexible credit requirements (student loans ya know).

About me:
34 (F), working full-time at a law office downtown.

Pretty chill, clean, and considerate—into music, coffee, record stores, and keeping a cozy home vibe.

I’ve got a friendly border collie (Archer) who’s well-behaved and loves people, so you’d need to be cool with pets.

What I’m looking for:
Someone responsible, communicative, and respectful of shared space.

Ideally around the same age range, professional or student.

Open to becoming friends, but totally fine if you just want to keep things roommate-level.

Budget / Location:
Looking to keep rent around $1,000–1,500 per person.

Open to neighborhoods like Capitol Hill, Queen Anne, Belltown, or anywhere decently connected by bus/light rail.

I don’t have a set place yet; down to team up and hunt, or I can bring you in on something I find.

I don’t smoke, light on drinking, no hard drugs.

LGBTQ+ friendly, pet friendly, and generally good-vibes-only friendly.

If you’re interested (or know someone who might be), shoot me a DM.

Thanks Seattle",1,1758553575.0,SeaHousing,1,1.0,False

NEW POST: Mom called Chase Bank without my knowledge, pretended to be me and lied about my income (she KNOWS I make at best 40k per year and lied saying i make 75k) to get me approved for credit card in her words to build my credit and make sure i cannot spend wildly she is holding it. I was super uncomfortable but was like okay if you think thats best. Continue like two weeks later and she called asking if she could charge a $1,000 to it, I asked for what and she said her hotel bill and I said well as long as you pay it off sure. I go into my bank app and see she charged $700 of electricity bill to it only, not the hotel she had said. She avoided three texts over two days asking why was it ComEd (electric here) and not the hotel like you said and she said well I decided to pay my electricity early? I dont even think thats a thing to like prepay for months in advance which is what she was implying, I think maybe she is very behind on bills?My mother has a very good job and good pay so I am weirded out already shes charging things to my credit line and lying about what she is charging and now I don’t know if she is in financial credit trouble and deferring to me to fix it or if this is just her grand plan of building my credit? She physically will NOT let me have the card it has always been in her possession and she refuses to let me have it, she is even upset I was able to add it to my Apple Wallet because she has text notifications when I do something with the card? I am 28 I feel this is not safe financially for me and I am unsure how to go about it because I looked it up and credit impersonating is a felony punishable by ten years and wouldn’t want her to go to jail but I do not want her using my credit or me unable to use a line in my name. Advice?

OLD POST FOR CONTEXT ON OUR RELATIONSHIP: TLDR; I (28F) used to be physically abused and now that Im an adult my mother has turned to emotional and financial power control, how to navigate relationship or should I go no contact again?

I (28F) have a very strange dynamic with my mother (46). She had me young and wasn’t with my father so I had split visitation with them growing up, my father over years of abusing me and nearly killing me lost custody and she became my sole parent and the one I called that night who rushed me to the hospital and police station effectively helping me escape abuse. I idolized her until around 7th grade when she began abusing me, first just hitting me with cleats when I’d miss a shot in soccer and embarrass her by not scoring like the other girls on the travel team, then it became full on fights where I would restrain her so she wouldn’t hit me and she would turn it into you tried to choke me! She always beat me in the head so my hair covered the bruises and my stepfather never cared and would pin me up against a wall and curse at me to get me to stop crying when fights occurred. I came out to my car taken from the school parking lot once just because I had upset her somehow and had to walk the miles home from highschool, I once sought shelter at a coworkers house and she wouldn’t tell her parents the simple sentence “I am not going to hit her tonight” so we never gave her the address and she ended up using the tracker she had on my phone to come find me then gaslit the families into saying I was on drugs and dangerous when they heard her over the phone refusing to say she wouldn’t hurt me. Even at church events I would be tracked during movies 15+ times because she never believed me and I would have to take 10 photos of friends and I around locations to prove I was where I said. I went away to college excited to escape abuse for the first time and started living a truthful version of myself in the safety that I was away; expressing my gender more freely, hanging out with people my mother deemed unattractive or unbecoming (she selected my friends in childhood based on their popularity and said I had to be friends with certain individuals) and becoming less attuned to doing what others willed of me, but she was still tracking me even in college until late in the night as friends and I would walk to houseparties she would be sending me my location on a map asking what I was doing and having to endure long phone calls. Gradually our relationship worsened until I hit a breaking point junior year and let her know that her behavior was causing a depression in me and I knew she had provided me with many opportunities, going to vacations out of country, getting me another car when I had totaled mine at 17, paying for my college and letting me be in extracurricular travel sports are all things that I very much appreciated but she would constantly call me ungrateful and say I am not deserving, she threatened me with a year of suffering if I didn’t fall in line. I met my significant other the next year, coming out drunkenly to my mother accidentally; context- she had always asked me if I was a lesbian since about 13 and would do so in manipulating ways where she would come downstairs to the basement where I lived and no one besides me ever stepped foot onto and brush my hair and offer to curl it (something we NEVER did) and then ask me and say its okay you know you can tell me but I always feared her violently reacting and my best friend made me promise to wait until we graduated college to tell her. In accidentally coming out my mother immediately began crying and saying she wanted to kill herself repeatedly, then threatened my phone line, car and college and finally my bank account if I wouldn’t just date a man to which I refused. She refused to let me leave the house the next day (Im 20) and friends came over to assure my safety and she made me send them away and tell them I wasn’t allowed out. I begged her not to tell my stepfather and she outted me while I was in the shower and she had assumed since he is such a MAGA Trump stan that he would be vile but he just said I don’t agree with that but you’re still my child and gave me a hug, to which my mother reacted angrily at my stepfather saying “how are you just going to say that” and yelling his name then”how could you” when he was simply a decent individual. We went no contact for maybe a year or two because she closed my bank account and stopped paying for my college tuition and apartment which I never would’ve gotten if she hadn’t assured me that she would be paying for it while I was in school. After missing much of my brothers adolescence I tried to get back into the family and its taken time and tons of screaming where shes spoken to my partner terribly but after 5 years we were well enough on speaking terms, and I told her that my partner and I were looking to buy a house. She offered to pay the down payment on the house that we had found and I was overwhelmed but overjoyed and agreed to pay it back in full. The house we purchased is 15 minutes from her house approximately. Once we got to town things were okay, she was offering to help with home projects and come over to garden and the like and it was kind gestures and welcome aid, but then she began buying us things that we didn’t ask for and saying we could just add it to the tab, and we told her financial we live paycheck to paycheck with all of our pets needing hundreds of dollars of supplies every month and our lifestyle of traveling so we would gently refuse, then she started mass buying things from cosco and keeping them in her garage and saying when we needed things (coffee beans, toilet paper, shampoo/conditioner, laundry detergent, trash bags, etc.) just to come and get it from her garage and pay her because she was trying to save us money, but then would get mad if I had bought myself some from kroger or something. Then she became overly invested in my work, showing up just to say hi and show my coworkers her dog, to the point she knew my schedule. She broke into and was in my bedroom at 7 AM hitting me one day to make sure I wasn’t late for work when I had a shift at 9AM. That petrified me and my partner because she installed our locks that are a numerical code. I yelled at her about that and she hasn’t done it again but the anxiety it gives me is a lot. She still does very kind things in between the whole time and we have always had more of a friendship type relationship than mother and daughter so we sweep it under the rug. Fast forward covid is rampant in our town and we are on a menards trip so I wear the only mask I had, a BLM mask and she became so irate that I wouldn’t take it off she physically hit me in public in the isles and I left the store crying. A few months later she comes over and helps me with my partner having a seizure because she is a medical worker and I am indebted to her immensely because it is 4:30 AM and I was panicking. Fast forward a few months and she calls me everyday a minimum of 5 times a day to upwards of 20 and these calls can be 5 minutes or 30 minutes, usually just her talking about herself, saying I need to do this and if I disagree she gets irate and yells “you fucking think you know everything huh” and curses at me and hangs up. She texts me a few times but mostly calls and is demanding that I do what she says or go to the gym because she thinks I am fat and says she needs to see every cent I spend because she wants to help me budget. She most recently called a bank and pretended to be me and lied about my income to get me a credit card that she will not give me but physically has herself and it is in my bank account now but I have no access to it. I just do not know where to go from here, theres been so much bad but when she’s good she is great and mentally I am at my wits end, I just booked a therapy appointment today to speak with someone about boundaries and how to deal with her because if I don’t reply or answer her calls she will come over to my house unannounced and she gets violent when she feels that she has been mistreated but I am exhausted from placating her daily, multiple times a day. Any advice on how to navigate this? Friends say I should go no contact again, and I have urged my mother to go to therapy since I was a child but she swears she is fine and I am mentally ill because I am diagnosed with anxiety and depression but I have awareness that extends to everything because of the abuse by my bio father and her over the years I am just extremely sensitive and would rather do what she wants than change our dynamic but its taking too much of a toll on me.",1,1758553542.0,Advice,4,1.0,False
1nnozpt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Retatrutide/comments/1nnozpt/started_retatrutide_2_weeks_ago_cant_eat_solids/,Started Retatrutide 2 weeks ago — can't eat solids now. Need advice.,"I started Retatrutide two weeks ago. My plan was to take it twice a week, every Thursday and Monday.

Week 1:

* Thursday: Took 1mg. Nothing happened.
* Monday: Took 1.25mg. Slight appetite suppression, but not a big deal.

Week 2:

* Thursday: Took 1.5mg in the morning — and everything changed.

Since then, my appetite has basically disappeared. But the real issue is that for the past 3 days, I haven’t been able to eat anything solid without getting sharp stomach pain and cramping in the upper part of my stomach. The only thing I’ve been able to tolerate is watered-down protein shakes. Anything heavier — like thicker shakes or actual food — triggers pain almost immediately.

Even drinking too much water brings back the discomfort. I’ve been running on low energy, skipping coffee, avoiding food, and honestly just feeling off. I want to eat protein to at least maintain muscle, but I physically can’t.

Today is Monday and I skipped my shot. I’m thinking about switching to once a week instead of twice to see if it helps.

I’m 5'10"" and around 195–200 lbs. Has anyone else dealt with this kind of upper stomach pain on Retatrutide? Is this a dose issue? A stomach sensitivity? I’d really appreciate any advice on how to manage this. I want the weight loss benefits, but not like this.",0,1758553540.0,Retatrutide,5,0.33,False

1nnoxvy,https://www.reddit.com/r/ShyBladderIPA/comments/1nnoxvy/lost_job_opportunity/,Lost job opportunity,"Hello everyone I’m new to this subreddit and happy to be here with people who understand.  This is going to be a very long post, I apologize.  I have all the conditions that go along with shy bladder such as social anxiety, GAD, ADHD, probably on the spectrum as well, although I don’t have a formal diagnosis.  I also have a history of severe constipation as a child due to holding it in for so long.  I’m now a middle aged female and have been dealing with some degree of this disability as long as I can remember.  I had a few episodes of peeing my pants as a child due to holding so long that my body just finally had to pee.  This was in school, second and third grade respectively.  I never quite lived that down.  As a teenager and younger adult in my twenties I would physically be unable to pee and it would lead to intense pain.  Traveling was rough.  At home I could usually relax enough eventually to start peeing.  As years went on and I went through child birth twice I seemed to get over this disability a little and have an easier time.  However giving urine samples could still lead to anxiety.  As long as I didn’t feel rushed and had some degree of privacy I could usually go.  

However, I recently had a situation that I have never dealt with before.  I applied for a new job, interviewed well and was offered employment rather quickly.  The onboarding process of course included the urine drug screen and I gave that, no problem.  I did  drink about 8 ounces of water to be able to urinate on demand.  My urine sample came back “diluted.” I have never had this happen before but I’ve recently lost a large amount of weight after weight loss surgery and I read that this can cause your urine to have low creatinine due  to muscle loss as well.  They called me back to submit another sample, this time being observed.  This created a sense of sick dread within me but I wanted the job so I complied and didn’t drink anything but a few sips of coffee.  No water from midnight on.  

Surprise, surprise I was unable to urinate in front of the lab technician.  She gave me a bottle of water and told me to try again in a little bit.  I drank most of the water and about half an hour later tried again.  I had the urge to pee but my bladder was on lock down.  She told me to wait a little longer and try again so I did.  By this time I had the old sensation of having to pee super bad to the point of painful pressure but still was unable to pee in front of her.  I was humiliated and agitated at this point and knew that it wasn’t going to happen.  I tried to call HR a few times as they used a separate lab facility to test.  I was unable to get through and the lab was extremely busy and loud and hectic and I could tell the lab tech was a little hassled by my inability to urinate.  I pleaded with her to let me just give a blood sample but she said they wouldn’t pay for it. I left that place defeated and wrote an email to Human Resources that I would pay to have saliva, hair follicle or blood test done due to my paruresis, to which they replied to just apply again in six months that they were not going to go forward with my hiring at this time.  I just don’t know what to do at this point. Thankfully I’m still employed at my current job.  I have not used any illegal drugs but I’m sure that’s not how they look at this situation.  And I’m not even being given a chance to clear my name.  Has anyone dealt with a similar situation?

I got home and after an hour, I had really bad palpitations and my BP rose to 156/99, I was also very jittery and could literally feel my heart pounding!! I have been drinking decaf coffee since I started, when I was on 30mg, I would normally have 2x and feel absolutely fine. I know it sounds really silly of me but I didn't realise decaf coffee aren't 100% decaffeinated and may contain a small trace of caffeine but I was just surprised that it's happened since I was fine having them when I was on the 30mg. 

Has anyone else had this experience? I was wondering if the cafe accidentally gave me a normal coffee rather than a decaf one, or have I become ultra sensitive to the smallest amount of caffeine since going up a dose?? Worth mentioning that I only had a protein bar and a protein shake for breakfast so that might also contributed to it.

The 5-Minute Start: I commit to just 5 minutes of any difficult task. 90% of the time, I continue past 5 minutes once friction is gone.

Not because they were peaceful (oh, no). The Thzzak'ti had glassed three systems just for parking violations. But assassination? Impossible. When your monarch is a literal node in a billion-mind psychic network, death comes with a choir scream. A billion voices shrieking in perfect synchronicity. No silence. No shadows. No secrets.

So when Queen Zzak'th's carapace was found cracked open like a rotten egg in her sealed chamber, when her neural crown went dark and no one felt it, the galaxy didn't just stop. It glitched.

The Hegemony's ambassadors tore their own antennae out. The AI councils spun their fans down to 0.3% efficiency, overheating from paradox. Even the V'rrl (gelatinous logic-gods who experience time as a spreadsheet) started vomiting prime numbers.

And into this chaos shuffled Detective Arthur Dibble.

Human. Fifth-degree rumple in his coat. Coffee stain shaped like the Orion Arm on his tie. The only investigator in the Galactic Criminal Investigation Bureau who still used a notebook. Paper. Wooden pencil. The other species called it “archaic.” They called him “the mammal with the leaky face-hole.”

But Dibble had solved the Impossible Thefts of the Crystalline Archive (turns out the thief was the archive). He’d cracked the Case of the Schrödinger Assassin (the killer was both alive and dead until Dibble observed him into handcuffs). As the Hegemony's billion drones rioted outside the station, chanting ""NO MIND LEFT BEHIND,"" Dibble simply scratched his head and muttered:

“Funny thing, though. Her Majesty’s royal jelly was room temperature. You’d think a queen worth her pheromones would keep it chilled, right? Just one more thing…”

The suspects were perfect:

Ambassador Krr’thk – The Queen’s liaison, whose exoskeleton shimmered with the ultraviolet guilt-patterns of his species.

Brood-Scribe Vzz’il – A six-limbed monk who could recite every egg the Queen had laid in 300 years, but claimed he’d “misplaced” yesterday.

Guard-Captain Thzz’rak led the royal drones, their wings dusted with pollen from the lethally toxic Forbidden Sector.

They laughed when Dibble entered. Not openly. Hive-minds don’t laugh. But the air tasted of smug. Primitive mammal. Can’t even share thoughts. They pitied him. Pitied us.

Dibble didn’t mind. He liked being underestimated. It made them talk.

“Tell me again,” he said, squinting at Guard-Captain Thzz’rak, “about the temperature. You keep the Queen’s chamber at 42.7°C, yeah? But the log shows a 0.2° spike for… oh, 43.2 seconds, three days ago. Now, I’m just a dumb human, but that’s weird, right? Like… breeding-temperature weird?”

The drone’s mandibles clicked. A billion minds hesitated. How does the mammal know our thermal triggers?

Dibble continued, ""And the brood (bless those cute little grubs), Queen Zzak'th's last clutch was 0.3% smaller. Doesn't sound like much. But you folks are precision, yeah? Like, eugenics-precision. So a 0.3% drop's like… me forgetting my pants. Unthinkable.""

He turned to the Brood-Scribe. ""You catalog every egg. But you missed three. Not laid but missing. Like they were never laid. Like someone replaced them. With, say… royal jelly? The kind that needs exactly 42.9°C to activate?""

The hive shuddered. A ripple of cognitive dissonance. A billion minds trying to process a variable they’d evolved out. Deception from within. Impossible. Unthinkable.

But humans? We specialize in the unthinkable.

The breakthrough came when Dibble stopped thinking like a detective.

He thought like a hive.

“See, here’s the thing,” he told the AI recorder, sipping cold coffee. “The Hegemony’s never had a secret. Can’t. Every thought’s a broadcast. But that’s the blind spot. They can’t imagine a crime that isn’t a secret. They’re looking for a culprit. I’m looking for a conspiracy of one.”

The killer wasn’t hiding from the hive. The killer was the hive. Or rather, a splinter. A tumor.

Queen Zzak'th had sensed it first: a wrongness in the brood. A mutation. Not genetic. Idea-etic. A sub-mind that had learned to lie. To simulate loyalty while nurturing heresy. The 0.3% smaller clutch? Replacement grubs. Grown in secret. Fed counter-royal jelly, a brew that would overwrite the hive's loyalty protocols. The temperature spike? Incubation.

The Queen tried to purge it. But the tumor learned. It isolated her. Exploited the hive mind's synchronization; a billion minds, blind to a single absence. They felt her die. But the tumor masked it. Made them feel her alive, even as they consumed her.

The perfect crime. Undetectable.

Except to a species that invented lying.

That evolved to detect individual motives in collective chaos.

Dibble didn’t solve it with logic. He solved it with empathy. With the specific loneliness of being the only creature in the room who couldn’t hear the hive. Who had to guess. To mirror. To ask:

“What would I do, if I were a mind that wanted to become the Queen? Not replace her. Become her. Infect her. Use her. And then… lay the new brood. The human brood. The brood that lies.”

The tumor wasn’t in the hive.

The tumor was the hive’s future.

The 0.3% weren’t missing. They were waiting.

The new Queen.

The human Queen.

Not human in species. Human in method.

A mind that could choose to lie.

To kill.

To invent crime.

Dibble stood before the brood-chamber as the new grubs hatched. Their eyes weren’t compound. They were simple. Predatory. They didn’t share. They watched.

He whispered, “Here’s the thing about evolution, kids. Sometimes the niche isn’t a place. It’s a flaw. You found the flaw in perfection. The human flaw. Congratulations. You just invented murder.”

He didn’t arrest them. Couldn’t. You can’t handcuff an idea.

But he reported it.

And the galaxy changed.

Now, every hive has a Dibble Protocol.

A mammal on retainer.

To ask the uncomfortable questions.

To think the unthinkable.

Because the Hegemony learned the human lesson:

Perfection is a vulnerability.

Only the flawed can see the crack.

And somewhere, in a rumpled office on a backwater station, Detective Arthur Dibble pours another cup of coffee, stains his tie with the next impossibility, and mutters:

“Oh, just one more thing…

What if the lie wasn’t the crime?

What if the truth was the weapon?”

I can’t have caffeine and only enjoy cold drinks, so crème frappes are my go-to. I’d love some tips on customizing them since my options feel limited.

My favorite is the Caramel Ribbon Crunch crème frappe. I know it’s off the crème menu now, so I just order it as crème from the coffee menu. I also like customizing the strawberry frappe—my go-to used to be swapping classic syrup for toffee nut (not available anymore), adding white mocha, and frappe chips. Any other good variations with this base?

I don’t like anything too vanilla (like Vanilla Bean) or too chocolatey (like Cookie Crumble). I love caramel, some fruit flavor is fine, but not too fruity. I don’t like pumpkin spice. I like a nice balance between vanilla and chocolate.

Back when I could have coffee, I loved the white chocolate mocha frappe. But the crème version just tasted like vanilla bean—way too sweet. I also loved matcha but can’t have it now.

Could I order the new Brown Sugar Strato Frappe as crème, and if so, how would I customize it? I know the base has caffeine in it, so I’m unsure how it works.

Any other non-caffeine base options that aren’t on the menu or creative combos worth trying? There are so many syrups/sauces/toppings that I sometimes get overwhelmed, so ideas would help a lot. Thanks!!

1nnoluc,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1nnoluc/dibble_and_the_case_of_the_altruism_virus/,Dibble and the Case of the Altruism Virus,"The Ventauri Syndicate didn't do charity.

Not because they were cruel (well, okay, yes, they were cruel). They'd liquidated entire planetary economies for quarterly profit spikes. But altruism? A pathological impossibility. When your species evolved on a world where every calorie was fought for, and your biology literally converted greed into metabolic energy, generosity was a death sentence. Ventauri who felt compassion simply starved.

So when Torq'ull, the most feared corporate raider in the Syndicate, was found dead in his penthouse office surrounded by charitable donation receipts totaling his entire fortune, the Syndicate didn't just investigate. They declared a biological emergency.

And into this pathological altruism shuffled Detective Arthur Dibble.

Human. Coffee stain on his tie shaped like a failed hostile takeover. Notebook held together with rubber bands because ""digital ledgers get corrupted, but grudges written in pencil last forever."" The only investigator in the Bureau who still treated impossible crimes like solvable puzzles.

But Dibble had solved the Case of the Recursive Bank Robbery (thieves stole the money they'd already stolen tomorrow). As the Syndicate's executives developed clinical anxiety about their own survival instincts, he stepped off his shuttle and muttered:

""Funny thing about biology. When it stops working, everything else stops too.""

The suspects were perfect:

**Dr. Krix'va** \-- Torq'ull's business rival, who'd mysteriously inherited his entire estate through a will nobody remembered him writing.

**Dr. Zel** \-- The Syndicate's chief neuro-economist, whose latest research into ""competitive advantage enhancement"" had gone missing the day before Torq'ull's death.

**Maintenance Chief Nex** \-- A hive-mind entity responsible for the building's atmospheric systems, who claimed the ventilation records from Torq'ull's floor had been ""accidentally"" purged.

They didn't panic when Dibble entered the crime scene. They vibrated with existential terror.

""Look at this,"" Dr. Krix'va said, mandibles chattering as she gestured to Torq'ull's desk. ""Seventeen million credits donated to refugee relief. Forty-three million to hospital construction. His entire portfolio liquidated for... for helping people.""

""CAUSE OF DEATH APPEARS TO BE STARVATION,"" Dibble announced after examining the corpse with his portable scanner. ""Despite abundant food supplies in immediate vicinity.""

Dibble examined the body. Torq'ull had died clutching a data-pad showing his final transaction: another million credits transferred to disaster relief. His expression was peaceful, almost beatific.

""How long since he ate?""

""The kitchen logs show he refused all meals for the past four days,"" Dr. Krix'va replied. ""Kept saying he 'wasn't hungry.' But that's impossible. Ventauri biology requires constant caloric intake fueled by competitive acquisition drives.""

""So what killed his appetite?""

""That's the problem, Detective. In Ventauri physiology, generosity triggers a metabolic shutdown. We literally can't process nutrients while experiencing genuine altruism. It's an evolutionary safeguard against resource waste.""

Dibble made a note. ""So he was poisoned by kindness.""

""Biochemically, yes.""

The breakthrough came when Dibble found Dr. Zel's lab.

Hidden behind a false wall in the building's research wing, the laboratory looked like a mad scientist's fever dream. Neurochemical analysis equipment. Behavioral modification chambers. And everywhere, those distinctive aerosol dispensers labeled with biohazard symbols.

""Dr. Zel,"" Dibble called into the seemingly empty lab. ""I know you're here. The coffee machine's still warm.""

A chitinous form emerged from behind a bank of computers. ""Detective Dibble. I... I was expecting you.""

""INDIVIDUAL SHOWS ELEVATED STRESS INDICATORS,"" Dibble observed, noting the rapid mandible vibration. ""Classic anxiety response.""

""Tell me about your research.""

Dr. Zel's compound eyes flickered nervously. ""Competitive advantage enhancement. I was trying to develop a neurochemical compound that would make Ventauri executives more ruthlessly efficient.""

""And?""

""The formula worked. Too well. Instead of enhancing competitive drives, it amplified them to the point where subjects began competing to be the most generous. They literally tried to out-altruism each other.""

Dibble examined one of the aerosol canisters. ""You turned kindness into a competitive sport.""

""It was an accident! The compound was supposed to enhance resource acquisition behaviors. But it created a feedback loop where subjects began acquiring resources specifically to give them away. They competed over who could be most selfless.""

""How was it delivered?""

""Atmospheric dispersal through the building's ventilation system. I was testing it on the executive floor. Torq'ull's office had the highest concentration.""

""Question,"" Dibble interjected. ""If compound enhances competitive behavior, why did subject experience metabolic failure?""

""Because,"" Dr. Zel said miserably, ""he won. Torq'ull achieved perfect altruism. He became so competitive about being generous that he triggered complete metabolic shutdown. His body literally forgot how to be selfish.""

Dibble studied the lab equipment. ""But you didn't just accidentally dose him, did you? You specifically targeted his office.""

""He was going to expose my research! Said it was too dangerous, too unpredictable. Threatened to report me to the Ethics Committee.""

""So you decided to test it on him directly.""

""I thought... I thought a small dose would just make him more cooperative in business negotiations. Easier to work with. I never intended for him to donate his entire fortune and starve himself to death.""

""But that's exactly what happened.""

Dr. Zel collapsed into a chair, his exoskeleton creaking. ""The worst part? It worked. His charitable giving was the most efficient philanthropic campaign in galactic history. Zero administrative overhead. Perfect resource allocation. He turned altruism into a hostile takeover of the poverty market.""

The confession came easily after that. Dr. Zel had been trying to create the perfect corporate raider, someone who could acquire resources with ruthless efficiency. Instead, he'd created something much more dangerous: someone who could distribute resources with the same ruthless efficiency.

""The compound doesn't make subjects altruistic,"" Dr. Zel explained as security led him away. ""It makes them competitive about everything, including kindness. Torq'ull didn't become generous. He became the best at being generous. And for a Ventauri, being the best at something that contradicts their biology is lethal.""

Dr. Krix'va watched the arrest with visible relief. ""What happens to his estate? I'm still technically the inheritor, but I don't want to die of involuntary philanthropy.""

""Court will probably distribute it according to his wishes,"" Dibble said. ""Which means every credit goes to charity, just like he intended.""

""But that's... that's actually what he would have wanted, isn't it?""

""Yeah. Funny how that works out.""

Later, filing his report, Dibble noted:

*Case Status: Closed*

*Cause of Death: Chemically induced metabolic failure due to excessive altruistic behavior*

*Weapon: Experimental neurochemical compound (atmospheric delivery)*

*Perpetrator: Dr. Zel (charged with involuntary manslaughter and illegal human experimentation)*

*Motive: Silencing potential whistleblower*

*Resolution: Subject died as unintended consequence of biological warfare research*

*Note: Victim's charitable donations will proceed as planned. Irony noted.*

Somewhere, on a backwater station, Detective Arthur Dibble poured another cup of free coffee, stained his shirt with the dregs of algorithmic altruism, and muttered:

""Just one more thing… turns out you can actually be too good at being good. Who knew?""

I, 27F, am seeking advice about a job offer I received. 

For context, as these posts start off with, I had to suddenly move back home with my parents due to some drama in the family. Though the drama isn't mine to share, I received the short end of the stick, resulting me to suddenly move back home and start over. 

So now that's out of the way, let's get into the job offer...

About three weeks ago, I interviewed with a local coffee shop. During the first interview, the owner asked me some personal questions like ""why I decided to move home,"" with professionalism, I explained that ""I wanted to be back home with my family, and I always have a soft spot for our home town"". But the owner didn't seem to appreciate my answers, he didn't mention it, but he would bring the topic back up as if he was trying to get me to tell him the real reason. Then he brought up my prior place of work, with a larger coffee franchise company, asking me questions about franchise owners I haven't worked for in over 2 years and their business endeavors, which I would have no clue, considering I haven't worked for that company in two years.

I left that interview with my head down in shame, knowing that was not a good first impression. A week after the first interview, they called me and did in fact choose someone else for the position. So I retracted my application and I thought we were going our separate ways. Until last week, when they asked me back for a second interview, where the owner told me, right off the get go,  he didn’t hire me at first because I was too calm and reserved, and that he found something “mischievous” about me. So he brought me in again so he could have me explain to him why I am the way I am. I was caught off guard to say the least, not knowing how to answer without coming acrossed as unprofessional or offended. Truth is, I am calm and reserve, his observations weren't offensive to me because it's the truth. But there was something about the context of the question, that caught me off guard because of the boundaries I felt it crossed? I've never been to a job where the employers called me back for a second interview, so it was all new to me, I went into the second interview as a learning opportunity, to see what I could do better as a potential candidate... But when the interviewer refuses to believe the reasons you moved home, and then make these preconceived ideas about you being mischievous and sit there as you explain why you are who you are, wouldn't that seem like an unethical way to get to know someone? 

Anyways... So after the second interview, they tell me they have more potential interviews but they would get a hold of me as soon as this week. And they offered me the position.

Now this is where I need advice, on my first day, I’m second-guessing everything because I feel like I’m walking into a situation where I’m already judged and might have to constantly prove myself. I’m now considering declining the offer because I don’t think the wage and the environment are worth the emotional and professional hoops I’d have to jump through.

AITA for backing out of the job offer because of the employer’s bias?


Side note**** I know an interview is where you are initially finding canadates, and where first impressions are made. I can understand wanting to get to know who you are hiring, but I always had a notion that there's still a fine line of professionalism you share with a employer. The owner also told me that he knew I would indeed be a great employee at his store based on my years of experience, but chose to ignore that and focus the interview soley on who I was as a person...

I also know that I prefer colder weather to warmer weather (grew up in Seattle, live in Charleston, now, and just don't vibe with the relentless heat). I like wearing long clothing. I miss wearing flannels, outerwear, etc.

I also prefer places where people enjoy getting coffee, a glass of wine, and more intellectual conversations (not in a pretentious way- I'm a very casual laid back person, who simply enjoys philosophical and psychology-related conversations). Charleston, for instance - while full of churches and honky-tonk dancing ladies in the smaller towns outside of Charleston - was too full of college girls, influencer-types, and boat-chasers. It feels very surface-level, here.

Okay, so I’ve already had a less than ideal undergrad experience with the OU (constant lack of communication during the teacher strikes, leaving students in the dark — basically the uni not giving a shit). I naively thought Roehampton would be different (and maybe it still will be), but so far it’s the same mess.

Couple of examples:

Student finance mess: They tried to direct debit my tuition fee before the SFE payment dates. On top of that, the uni still hasn’t confirmed my application to SFE, so everything’s delayed and I’m stuck in limbo. The failed debit didn’t go through because I didn’t have that much in the account, but what if it had been the day before rent? How is this not organised better?

Information: What they sent me before and after enrolment was really limited. Nothing about induction days, no “to-do” list beyond the online enrolment. Of course, I can google the info, and that wouldn’t matter too much if it wasn’t for the fact they did manage to send me about five thousand emails about Fresher’s Festival, pub quizzes and “that favourite coffee place.”

Phone support: Basically impossible. They pick up after 30 minutes, transfer me to someone else, and then the call just drops. Happened three times.

Induction nonsense: As a part-time student, I (like most others) work full-time and also have a second weekend job just to make ends meet. Despite that, they force part-timers to attend a full-day induction. Why? It’s completely tone-deaf to the reality of part-time students’ lives. And if it is a must, why not at least run it on a Saturday?

I honestly don’t get it at all.

I remember trying to help my dad in the garage years ago, and he’d always say a strain was just your body telling you to slow down for a week. But waiting it out felt so passive, like watching paint dry while your wrist just throbbed. I wanted to \*do\* something about it, to feel like I was helping it along, not just punishing it with stillness.



That feeling came back last month after I tweaked my wrist moving a potted plant. The stiffness was the worst part—a dull reminder every time I reached for a coffee mug. I started looking up those gentle rehab exercises, the ones where you barely move but still feel a stretch. They helped, but it was hard to know if I was even doing enough, or if I was just going through the motions.



It was my physio friend who mentioned that recovery isn’t just about stretching; it’s also about gradually reintroducing resistance. She talked about the importance of the tiny muscles in your hand and forearm, the ones that really stabilize everything. She said the goal was to wake them up again without overwhelming them, which made perfect sense.



That’s when I thought about that simple tool I’d seen—just a pair of handles connected by a spring. It was almost comical how basic it looked, like something from a different era. But the action of squeezing it, slowly and with control, created a completely different kind of awareness in my wrist. It wasn’t about brute force; it was a quiet, consistent conversation with the weakened muscles.



Within a couple of weeks, the difference was in the little things. Turning a stubborn doorknob didn’t make me hesitate anymore, and that morning stiffness faded away. It felt less like a recovery and more like I’d just quietly gotten my reliable hand back.

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Not a sign of anyone being here besides me. Absolutely nothing at all. 
Crickets chirp around me, owls who-ing in the distance. As peaceful as a night should and can be.

""What the actual hell was that?"" 

I make my way back inside and shut and lock the door. I make sure all windows are shut and locked. And turn everything off in the cabin. 

It was close to 1:30am by this point. and since I had basically done my nightly check in outside like Josh said and everything was normal. Besides what just happened. 

I decided that I should just get in bed and hopefully go to sleep. 

I brushed my teeth and cleaned my face, just trying to ignore what just happened. thankfully the water does work well and is even heated. So that's a plus right now. I Got my clothes changed and started into bed. 

I made sure I brought my own sleeping bag and pillows, didn't wanna use the old and God knows how many people's heads have used pillows here. 

The bed is nothing amazing. It's a twin size bed that looks like it has been clearly well used. But thankfully has visibly clean sheets and a comforter. But I still put my sleeping bag on top of the cover. I get in and zipped up inside and got all good and comfortable. Its pretty cool in the cabin this time of the year, so the sleeping bag was a good choice. 

After a little while I ended up passing out and apparently sleeping through the whole night. Without a peep from me. but with plenty of sounds all around me. Peaceful.
A Goodnight to me.

I woke up the next morning around 8:30am.
it was cold that morning so it took a lot of energy and motivation to get out of my sleeping bag. Cause who like's waking up freezing. 

But once I did get out, I started on my normal morning routine. Got coffee, brushed my teeth. Clean clothes on and prepared myself for the start of a new day and my new life for awhile. 

(Several months pass)
-

Time went by rather quickly being out here. When I first came out here it was had just started to get chilly and leafs just started falling off of the trees and bushes. But still nice out 

Now a blanket of snow has covered everything all around me. Giving my zone an air of beauty I didn't know was possible. 

I've been spending most of time walking around during the day. So far I'm getting to know my zone well, I've marked everything I've come across on my map and take notes for reference points and land marks. 
I made sure to take plenty notes of all animals activities like they told me to.

All the patterns of the herds of Deer I see around take and do, this one particular Buck in the herd. He was massive and one of the most impressive Racks I've ever seen on a Buck. 
I talk about how often I see a squirrel take a dump. I saw a Duck fly over head the other day, I couldn't recognize it but it had gorgeous colors and a unique band around its neck. 
I even got an awesome picture of two chipmunks sitting on a snow covered log while it lightly sprinkled over top of them.

I've also been getting my daily routine down pat at the cabin. Making sure to radio into the Ranger station of my accounts throughout the day and filing my reports on the computer to send to headquarters and Rich. With all my down time, I'm also getting pretty good at Texas Hold 'Em. 
I still haven't been able to make out the temp on the oven. So I just set it to something and wait til it gets warm and throw my food in and just watch it until it looks cooked. What a life.

I haven't had any more moments of silence or any guest show up to the cabin like the first night here.
I make sure to say hello everytime I step outside, walk to a new spot I haven't been. And everytime I walk back inside the cabin. It's becoming a second nature thing for me to do by this point. Things were normal, for awhile at least. 

There was one morning after waking up. Something wasn't normal. It was quiet.

I woke up later than I have most mornings, but normal for the most part. except I couldn't hear anything. 

""you just woke up, maybe just still asleep some and not hearing everything right away."" 

So I get up and walk to the bathroom which isn't far from my bed. I pee and start my morning bathroom routine. 
I still couldn't hear anything. Not evening me peeing. 

Still just thinking I'm half asleep. I went to go start washing my face and hands, and also brush my teeth. I turn the water on and couldn't hear the faucet running, nor anything on the sink making noise when I moved them. Absolute silence. 

I thought that maybe I haven't said enough hellos or missed saying it at some point yesterday. Wasn't sure but again, better safe than sorry. I said ""Hello"" and waited for the sweet sounds of the woods to creep back in like they have before. Except this time, Nothing happened. I couldn't even hear myself talk.
I haven't even heard the gentle ""Hello"" I have everytime before. Just absolute and utter silence. 

I start to panic a little and get some clothes on fast as I can and walk outside to start saying ""Hello"" and hope everything goes back to normal. 
Get my pants on, a shirt and some slippers I brought.
I open the front door. Walk to the bottom of the last step going outside. Take a deep breath and yell ""Hello!"". 
Still absolutely deafening silence. 
""Oh shit. this can't be good.""
""I know, I can send an email to the Station and let them know what's happening."" 
after that I headed back inside, got on the computer and wrote to the station a message. 

""Rich or Josh are you guy's there? I just woke up and I can't hear anything. What's going on?"" 

I Sent it and waited by the computer for a response. 

It took a few minutes to get a response but when I did, it was Jonah. 

He said. 
""Alex it's Jonah. Rich and Josh left out earlier this morning to go meet with the neighboring County Ranger teams to discuss some roads being blocked by some downed trees on the line and to see what needs to be done. They told me to wait inside for messages or calls on the radio. have you been making sure to say Hello?"" 

Me.
""Yes I have, literally every time I make a step or breath I take I say it so the silence stays away. 
Have you been making sure to say it?"" 

Jonah.
""Of course I have, I have worked here for 4 years now and have never slipped up once. And I can hear just fine! Are you 100% sure you've been saying it?""

Me.
""YES IVE BEEN SAYING IT I SWEAR!. Is there any reason you know why it's happening if everyone here makes sure to says it? Obviously we all have been saying it, or less I could hear right?""

It took Jonah a good few minutes to respond, When he did he said. 

Jonah.
""Right, this has happened like this before. About a year ago, during the off season. a homeless man wondered into the park and got lost. it happened then, stayed quiet while they looked for them. Police got involved, Rich had me stay at the station while him and Josh went out looking with the Police. After probably 3 hours of searching they found him and brought him back to the station. He couldn't speak so he couldn't answer questions, the police took him away and that was that. The silence wouldn't go away until nearly a week later. It just went away like it normally does. We never knew why it finally lifted.

Me.
""Okay, so does that mean there's possibly someone lost out here and they're causing this to happen? And why couldn't he speak?

Jonah.
""Yes it's a high probability, even though the park has been closed for the season.
No we don't know and couldn't find out. He couldn't write or sign anything, he didn't even acknowledge we were there. Just a dead stare on his face the whole time he was here.""

I had to ask. 

Me.
""What happened to him?"" 

Jonah.
""I don't know, never heard anything after they left with him. But like then, I'm guessing if you can't hear anything. Someone's gotta be out there."" 

Me.
""Okay, should I start making my way to the station, then we set out and both start looking together?""

Jonah.
""No I can't leave. Rich said no matter what, don't leave the station. someone's gotta be here to radio into and take calls from headquarters. Except now it's a message headquarters thing. You should head out and start by your cabin and work your way around til you get to the station, check in with me before heading back around."" 

Great, now I have to go look for someone who's not supposed to be out here and bring them back to safety, while not being able to hear a dang thing. Obviously a lost person isn't good, just not sure how easy it'll be since I can't hear anything. And not knowing what happens with it quite like this for a long time. But i gotta look for them. No just for their safety. But possibly for all of us out here.

I reply to Jonah. 
Me.
""Okay, I'll get a bag packed with some supplies and start from the east side of the cabin and work my way to you. And what's the code to the safe in my cabin with the gun?""

Jonah. 
""I'm not allowed to share the code unless it's an emergency situation."" 

I wanted to beat Jonah through the screen. 
Me. 
""THIS IS A FUCKING EMERGENCY JONAH! GIVE ME THE DAMN CODE NOW!"" 

Jonah.
""It's 2709. All the shells for it should be in there and have a bag to carry them in."" 

Me.
""Thank you. I Hopefully won't have to use it for anything. But better safe than sorry.
If I don't make it by night fall to the Station. Come looking."" 

Jonah.
""Understood. Bring your radio with you too just in case you find the person and can call it in. Good luck, and Be safe.""

Me. 
""I'll do my best. Thank you.""

I get out of my seat and start throwing on my cold weather clothes and boots and Pack a bag with some food and water and an extra jacket. Flashlight and batteries, the radio. And get the gun from the safe and load it full and throw the ammo bag over my shoulder as fast I could move. 
I grab my map and head out looking for someone out here, hoping to stop this soon.

I start to head east and make my loop toward the station, I'm looking at probably a probably a good 10 mile plus I have to cover,  and I have to try and make it there before night and hopefully have found someone on the way and make the silence go away. 

Time passes and I've made it probably close to five miles by now. Still haven't found anyone and the silence hasn't gone away yet. I started walking after 11am and it's 2pm now. at least I'm making good time, given everything going on. 
But thick and dark clouds begin to close in over head, it starts to snow and it's comes down hard. 

After a short time. I start to get close to a spot I marked on my map that has a small pond that usually the animals around here drink out of. I was expecting it to be frozen over from the cold and no animals around.

I was wrong.

I see the Buck I took note of, his thrashing all around in the pond breaking up the ice. The Buck is mangled and covered in blood, and laying all around the pond are the bodies of the hard of Deer he ran with. All dead. 

""What the hell is going on?"" I think to myself. 

And after a few seconds of watching it. It turns and sees me. And it starts to come towards me.

End of Chapter 4. 
-

Chapter 5.
-

*It starts to run towards me.*

It jumps out of the water faster than I ever thought a Deer could. Pushed through all the ice like it was nothing. I stood frozen in disbelief as to what I was seeing. 

""What's making the Buck do this? Is it the silence?"" I think to myself. 

Before I could react, The Buck reaches me and goes head first right through my left shoulder, impaling me with its Antlers and then it picks me up high into the air. Violently shaking its head around. 
I fight to get my gun shouldered while it swings me around, I manage to get the gun steady and cram the barrel onto the back of the Bucks head. 

With just a simple pull of my finger. 
I fire the gun. Not a shot heard at all. 
But I kill the Buck.

With me still stuck in it's antlers, we both fall to ground. after we hit hard and settle, I start to pull myself off of the antlers and lay over on my back. 

""FUCK!"" I scream from the pain. 

After laying on the ground and to take a second to breathe. It suddenly hits me, something I've not heard for the last few hours. 

""I just heard myself scream""

I take a deep breath and let out a gentle.

""Hello?"" 

Nothing answers, and I hear noting. Besides my own voice still. 

""I actually can hear myself talking again""

 This is a start. but now I'm really confused. 

""How could I not hear myself before, but only after killing the Buck I can? What can that mean? no time to dwell on it now. I gotta move and get to the station."" 

I slowly pick myself up and take my backpack off to get to a trauma kit I brought with me and start applying a quick clot powder to help stop the bleeding. it burns like hell to put on, in case you didn't know. So yeah I screamed a good few times doing that, and than I bandage my shoulder up the best I can. 
Once I'm patched up enough to move. I stand up, I get my bag back on. I take my right arm and rack a new shell in by slimming it to the ground to operate the pump. And now, its time I take a good look at this Buck.

Its antlers are basically destroyed, chipped and cracked. Except for a few points he impaled me with. It looks like he fought a hundred other bucks with these.
His whole body looks like he's been attacked by a pack of wolves and lived to tell the tail. 
Foam coming out of the mouth and absolutely no life left in its eyes. 
Of all my time out being in the woods, I haven't seen anything like this. 

I've seen Deer before with CWD, But this wasn't like that, It's literally as if it went mad and started fighting everything in sight. Like something drove it to do all this. 

After inspecting the Buck. I walk over to check all the other Deer to see what happened to them. Every last one has also been impaled by antlers similar to my wounds.

""That Buck killed them. But why and what made him do this?""

With no time to hang around and try figure things out yet. I have to get to the station. 

""I need to get my shoulder fixed up better soon. It's still early, so I have time to make there before dark"" 

I slowly start to make my way there, having to stop occasionally to adjust my backpack and make sure I'm not bleeding through my bandages. I keep pushing the best I can, it was all well and good until clouds covered over head and began to start snowing really heavy on me. 

""I gotta move quicker than this. I can't get stuck out here in this much snow right now.""

The snow started coming down heavier and heavier by the second. And getting colder and colder by the second. 
I walk as fast as I can and keep pushing. I stop to take a breath, it's than I notice something else in the distance. A person standing alone and looking around. Obviously lost and confused. 
I quickly run into their sight and start waving my hands around. 
They see me, they waved back to me. I start to head towards them. 

""Come on say it, please!"" 

I hoped the person would start to call out for me and say Hello. 
I run over to them and kept waving to show them I mean no harm. I can now clearly see it's a younger woman, shes been out here for awhile, almost blue from the cold, barely wearing anything fit for a snowy hike in the woods.

I try to talk to her in hopes she would talk back and maybe say hello and hopefully make the silence go away. 
She jesters to her ears and shake her head ""No"" meaning she can't hear. 
I jester for them to speak, she shakes her head no again. 
I forgot my phone at the cabin or i would have used that to talk to each other. But thankfully I remembered I had my note book in my pocket, so I pulled it out and write down a question, I showed it to her. 

""Can you hear anything?""

Obviously she shakes her head no.

So I asked another question. 

""can you talk?"" 

*She shakes her head no*

So then I asked. 

""Why can't you talk? Are you deaf?"" 

*She again shakes her head saying no*

It took me a second to piece together what might be up with her, I thought of only one other thing I can think of to ask her. I write. 

""Are you mute?"" 

*she nods yes* 

After that it makes some sense. 
this is probably why the silence hasn't gone away.  She can't speak so she can't say Hello, probably just like the homeless man Jonah mentioned. He was probably mute too. But why didn't Jonah mention it getting crazy like it has been? I guess We'll find out soon enough. 

Seeing how absolutely cold this girl is.
I take my backpack off and pull out the extra jacket I brought and give it to her to put on and get warm. After she put its on zips it up. 

I write down that she needs to follow me and that I'll take her to safety. I show her the note and she reads it and nods her head ""yes"" understanding. 
I hold out my hand for her to take it and she does. We start walking in the direction towards the station and slowly make our ways there. 

Not far after we start walking we get to an open field in a valley, I have been here many times before. It was always so beautiful and peaceful. But not this time. 
More animals are running around, going absolutely crazy. 
Squirrels fighting and killing each other. 
Birds flying into trees and rocks taking their own lives.
More deer tearing each other to shreds. Absolute chaos is occurring in these woods. No time to sit and watch, and potentially get us both hurt or even killed. 

""We have to get out of here and make to the Station."" 

I take her arm and pull her along with me. We run as fast as we can, and get as far out of sight as as we can.

After several hours of running since I found the girl and us seeing the animals chaos in the field. We finally reach sight of the Station in the distance, thankfully right before the sun starts to set, and the snow falls gets even worse. We pick up our pace and hurry up over there, we get into the trail head gate that I entered in many months ago and headed into the parking lot and towards the front of the building. All is calm out here surprisingly. so I felt good having her stay outside while I head in to get Jonah. 
I get to the front door and try opening it, only to found it's locked. 

""Damn it Jonah!, Gotta try the back door.""

I go back to the front and I write down in my notes to tell the woman to stay by the table out front while I go around and try to get inside. She nods yes and takes a seat on the outsides tables benches. 
I make my way around back and find the back door and go over to open it. It's unlocked. I get inside and start looking for where Jonah is. 

After a few minutes of searching throughout the whole downstairs, the offices, kitchen and common area. No ones here. 
I quickly head upstairs to look room to rooms and bathroom to bathrooms. I check every inch, under beds and in closets. Not a sign of Jonah inside anywhere. 

Thinking he must have left to go find me or to go look for the lost person. I go back to the woman out front, she's no longer sitting at the outside table. But she's near the main gate entrance, she's looking out at the road coming into the station. 

There he is, Jonah just standing there in the middle of the road. Looking forward and seems to be on the phone. Not phased by what's happening. 
I go beside the woman and jester we both walk over to him. 
But before we leave out the gate to the road. For the first time all day, and for what now seems like forever ago. 
I hear it. 

""Hello""
Flying through the air like many times before and gently brushing against my ears.

I look to the woman and she's also looking at me. A very concerned and confusing look. She must of heard it too. 

""Why now? Why do we hear it but not a sound or word the entire time we were in the woods. Why do we hear it now?""

I nod to her that I heard it too. She takes my hand and we walk to Jonah. The second my foot hits the asphalt to the main road. Is when it hits me, the moment we entered the gate. 
All the noise of the world is entirely back. Birds singing, squirrels barking and water roaring. I can even cars on the highway a few miles away. Everything is normal here. Dang near brought me to tears. 
And I only just now noticed. 

Jonah turns and see us, he yells, ""ALEX!"" And starts to run toward us

He reaches us and begins to talk. 

""Alex! I was gonna say I'm glad you're alright. But that shoulder tells me otherwise, what the hell happened out there?""

I explain to him most of what happened, the Buck and the Deer by the pond, finding the girl and us seeing all the animals losing their minds. 

""Holy shit."" Jonah reply's. ""What a crazy day this has turned into. And who's the girl?""

Great question, cause this whole I haven't even asked her who she is. Jonah ask before I could. 

""Ma'am what were you doing out here and how did you get into the park? And are you okay do you need any medical assistance? What's your name?"" 

She looks to me and jesters a writing move, obviously wanting my note pad. I hand it to her and tell Jonah. 

""I haven't asked her name or anything like that. I was kind of taken up by other things going on out there and really didn't think it was time for chit chat or even her name. She can't talk, she's mute. So she'll have to speak to us in writing."" 

He nods understanding, he looks to the woman and hands her his phone and takes my note pad from her. 

""Use this so you can type it out faster okay?"" 

She nods yes. Starts typing a message and finishes rather quickly given what she wrote, she hands us the phone. 
It reads.

""My name is Mia, I was in the Little Hungry Gamelands not far from here, I went out yesterday morning to hike to Bottle Neck Rock. 
(The area she's talking about is in the country over. A good 7 or so miles from my cabin and Bottle Neck Rock is about 5 miles from my zones end, near where I found her in the zone.)
I go hiking a lot and felt confident to do this one. but this was my first going hiking during this time of the year. while I was on my way up there. It started snowing pretty bad. I decided it was best to start heading my way back to my car, I took a wrong turn at one of the forks in the trail, And ended up lost and managed to make it all the way out here, I found a hole in the fence from a downed tree and went through it.
After sometime of walking. 
I slowly stopped hearing things and then suddenly I couldn't hear anything anymore. I got scared and just kept moving and trying my best to not stop until I found somewhere to hide out and get warm. I thought I was done for, until he showed up and found me.""

I don't know what was going through Jonah's mind. But his face had a mix of anger and fear. For what reasons I was unaware of now. But he looked to her

""Ma'am I'm happy Alex here was able to find you and bring you back to safety. I need to tell you two something because with all respect ma'am, You being out here has caused a massive shit show. but let's go inside so Mia here can get warm and me get you cleaned and bandaged up Alex. And I'll explain everything then.""

We get inside and Jonah sits me at the kitchen table and gets me comfortable. He then helps Mia get some blankets and puts her by the fire to sit and get some heat back in her. 

He gets a Med Kit from one of the closets and comes back to the table and pulls a chair up beside me. He helps me take my layers off so he can start treating my wounds. 

Apparently between the Adrenaline and Fear I was going through out, I hadn't realized or noticed how bad that Buck actually got me. While cleaning me up Jonah tells me. 

""This thing got you freaking good, almost got your Subclavian Artery, pretty sure your collarbone is broken. And they came out the back of your shoulder blade. Jesus Christ""

He begans cleaning the wounds and uses some type of anti septic spray. It burns like absolute hell. I start banging my fist on the table from the pain. he goes as fast and as safely as he can, sowing up the wounds and applying antibiotic ointment. He then starts wrapping up my shoulder and begins to explain what's all going on. 

""Alright so both you listen. Mainly you Mia, these woods are home to something, what it is I'm honestly not sure of. We're never told anything about it other than, we have to say hello every time we go somewhere out here. 
The station area and road are safe. You ever wonder why there was a fence all the way around, it's to obviously keep people out."" 

He continues. 

""For normal people who do get lost, these situations kind of sort themselves out. Cause anyone lost is at some point is going to say Hello. 
Except for 2 times I've noticed. 
The first was a story I told Alex about a homeless man getting lost, and now you Mia. And with you not being able to speak, Well. I genuinely don't know what happens when we don't say it. You two seeing the animals go ape shit isn't something I've ever experienced my whole time here."" 

He looks to Mia.

""So in short. We gotta find a way to get you to say hello, or God knows what'll happen to us all."" 

End of Chapter 5.
-
Chapter 6.
-
The look on Mia's face when Jonah said this. Was a look of  fear and dread like I had never seen before. 
Worry being clearly shown through her eyes, tears start to form in the corners and slowly fall down her cheek. 

I ask Jonah a question regarding the previous time this occurred. 

""What really happened to the Man? If he couldn't speak, why did all the stop and not continue? What was done?"" 

He took a deep breath and then answered.

""I really don't know, he was old and looked like he was on his last leg.
After they took him. it didn't calm down and we had to shut the entire park down and even had to send workers home still it got sorted out. A week after we found him, It all went back to normal. So my guess is he must have died."" 

I gave Mia a worried look and then looked back to Jonah and I asked. 

""So will she have to. Well, You know?"" 

He replied. 
""No i don't want it to come to that. We'll do whatever we can besides that."" 

We didn't know what else to say or do. So we just waited. For something to happen.

Close to an hour of sitting quiet amongst ourselves and thinking of all the possibilities we have. The front door opens and in walks Rich, he looked directly at me and says.

""Alex, I'm going to need you to come with me."" 

""Why, what's?"" Before I could finish my sentence, Rich interrupts me and yells 

""OUTSIDE NOW ALEX!.

I hurriedly get out of my seat and walk past Rich holding the door open for me. 
Three men all wearing uniforms similar to Rich's are standing around Josh and are looking at the woods and what chaos unfolding out there. One of the men with a White uniform shirt on, turns around and faces us. He looks directly at me and says. 

""Alex you get yourself over here now, I have some questions for you."" 

I go and stand beside the man, who puts his arm around me and starts to walk me towards the gate into the woods. He begins to speak. 

""Now Alex, I know you don't know me, but I clearly know you. I'm Leigh McMurray, one of the seat members for the WRC in the State house. I personally picked you for this job. I saw your resume when you applied. You had lots of time outdoors, took some navigation and survival training courses. You were a good fit, I thought I could trust you with this job, and now I'm not so sure. And as your boss, I have to ask. do you care to explain to me what in Gods good earth is happening out here? And I want the truth."" 

I take a deep and began to explain everything. What happened the morning I woke up and couldn't hear anything. all the animals killing each other and themselves and terrorizing the woods. every detail in between. Except for one part. I leave her out. 
He starts to pat me on the back and laughs. He takes a few steps forward and turns around to face me.

And he says. 
""Now now Alex, Tall tails don't do you, me or anyone any good. Why lie?"" 

I give him a very confused look and ask.
""what do you mean? I swear I'm telling the truth."" 

Leigh laughs even more. And says.
""Come on now boy. You should know that ain't the truth I wanna hear. But since you don't know, I'll fill you in. 
A year ago some shit stain of a homeless guy got himself lost out here and well, he couldn't talk and make things better. We've seen many times before. Ol' Rich and me were partners working this Station. We know the deal. 
When someone can't speak and steps foot out here. The woods is angered. Now I wont lie to you, what's controlling everything and making the whole place into hell on earth, is not something I plan to piss off anymore by not doing what it wants. I know It's pleased when people say hello to it. And We all who work here make sure that happens. Even when several poor soul can't. Like the Cat got their tongues apparently. 
The homeless bastard clearly did. He had to please the damn thing one way or another. We looked into who he was and he was no one and a no one means no one to miss him. So he paid the price, just like someone's gonna have to. I know you found a girl out there. And she has a price to pay."" 

I know what he's getting at, I just can't believe it. 

""So telling me, that girl has to die. And I have to kill her, In order to please this thing?""

He's response makes me sick. 

""Well I'm not getting blood on my hands, and us having rotating employees like you makes things so much easier. Why do you really think we'd pay someone as well as we do to just watch some trees? You'll afford the therapy afterwards. Just get it done."" 

After he finishes talking, he just turns around and walks to Rich and tells him a few things. He waves to his man and they all begin to leave. Rich then walks up to me and leans in close. He says 

""Take her to the cabin, keep it clean and throw her down the outhouse hole. There's a reason we never put a real toilet in, makes for a good cover. And once you've done that. Radio in that it's taken care of. Do I make myself clear?""
 
After he finishes. I think to myself. 
""The bathrooms hole, of course it has something to do with what's happening. What a shitty job.""

After that thought, I then squint my eyes to him and ask. 

""Well, what if I say I'm not just going to kill some girl for some spirit because you told me to. What then?"" 

He looks down and shakes his hand. 
""You think we're okay with throwing just her in the hole? Be real with me son, you can't just back out of this. You have no real choice. Take her to cabin and end this."" 

I don't know what to feel right now, I'm at a loss for words. why do I have to do this? how can they make me do this? I can't believe I took this job. How can Rich and Leigh be perfectly fine with just killing people if needed. And what's making all of this happen. I have to know, and the only way I could think of. The hole may tell me. We have to go down there. 

""Okay, I'll take her there now. It'll be done."" 

I head back inside, when I enter Mia and Jonah both are waiting. 

Jonah ask. 
""Alex what's going on? Who was outside talking with you?"" 

I don't answer Jonah. I look to Mia. 

I say to her. 
""Mia, I need to take you somewhere. It'll be okay I promise."" 
I turn to Jonah and say. 
""Keep Rich and Josh here best you can. I'll get this taken care of."" 

He nods, I get my clothes back on and my backpack. I sling my gun over my shoulder. Then me and Mia out towards the cabin. 

The way there was pure insanity. 
So many dead creatures lay around everywhere. Rabbits and Raccoons. Deer by the dozens. Birds in the hundreds. It looks like a War Zone. Some animals are still alive, running wild and killing each other when the opportunity presents itself. I've truly never experienced anything like this in all my life. 
We rush and run for our lives. After hours of running, We get within seeing distance to the cabin and hurry inside. Once in I shut and lock the door. 
We take a minute to catch our breath and once we have. I explain to Mia what I was told to do. 
Everything. 
She starts to sob and falls to her knees. 
I go over to her and wipe her tears and begin to explain what my plan is. 

""We're going into the hole. I have rope and plenty of lights. We either find a way out of here. Or we find out what's causing of all of this. Do you trust me?"" 

She nods yes, I take her hands and stand her up. I get a new set of clothes for myself on, I've still been in my bloody ones from the Buck earlier. After I get changed, I ask her if she wants anything new to wear or anything warmer. She nods yes so I grab her one of my shirts and another one of my other jackets. She's changes and after that. We both get some water down our throats. Then I get the rope ready to go down in the hole. One way or another. I will put an end to this. No matter what. 

I head into the bathroom and start tearing the wood off of the outhouse seat. Once I get it all torn apart. 
I take a chem light from a pack I found in the cabin when I first got here. I open one up and break it on. I drop it down the hole and watch for it to hit bottom. 
It falls and falls. It eventually hits ground.

""Has to be at least eighty feet or more. You can get down this no problem right Mia?"" 
I ask, she looks to me and nods no. 
""Can I lower you down first? I promise I'll be right behind you. I'll get you out of this."" 
She nods yes. 
I tie the rope around the bathtub, it's full metal and bolted to the floor. It'll hold both of our weights. 

I make sure my knots are tight and secure. 
I get myself and her a makeshift climbing harness and get us both set and ready to go down. I get her ready and set up to send her. I put a flash light in her pocket with extra batteries just in case. 

I help her Into the home until she's low enough that I can just ease her down. My shoulder isn't going to make this easy, but I push through the pain and gently lower her in. I told her when she reaches the bottom to tug on the rope three times and then I'll come down. 

After a several long and painful minutes. 
She hits bottom. 
I then set myself up and slowly lower myself into the hole. 
Time to finally see what's behind all of this. Whether it's good or bad. I have to know.

I am devastated.","**I (M32) was sticking to strict no contact with my ex (F29).** We broke up because we couldn’t move in together, and it created resentment. After the breakup, we mutually agreed to no contact and stopped all communication.

We had one brief bump-in before, we caught up a little, she expressed resentment but also said she still cared about me. Another time I accidentally pocket-dialed her on Instagram, she called back and texted to check if I was okay. I explained it was an accident, and we both agreed to block each other on social media to avoid that happening again.

Fast forward 4 months later. I had built a new routine, I was feeling better, making friends, and frequenting a café near my new workplace. I’d been going there for months, 45 minutes before work to read, during lunch to read, and after work to grab a snack. I loved the place. The staff gave me free snacks and refills, and I got to know them personally. They felt like new friends, and the service and coffee were amazing.

Last Wednesday I walked in and unexpectedly saw her behind the counter. She looked surprised and said, “Wow, long time no see.” I was caught off guard, mumbled “yeah,” grabbed my order, and sat down. It was short and awkward.

The next day I sent her a respectful text:

*“Hey! Great running into you, I was honestly just surprised to see you after so long. I usually stop by that café on my breaks to read, so I didn’t want it to seem weird. It was nice seeing you, hope you’re doing well. And if it ever feels awkward, just let me know, I’d never want to make things uncomfortable for you.”*

She didn’t reply.

On Thursday I skipped the café because I felt spooked. On Friday, I went back like I normally do as per the recommendation of my therapist (they mentioned it was a public space and my space too, and I agreed) . She served me, and she initially tried to make my order to go. When I said, “It’s for here, I want to read, but if you want me to leave, I could,” she responded, “It’s fine that you’re here… it’s weird. I feel weird.” I kept to myself, read my book, and left.

A few hours later she texted me: “Don’t come back to the café.” Then she blocked me.

I feel devastated, not because I wanted her back, but because I lost my routine, my reading spot, a place that gave me daily peace. I even lost staff who had become friends. It feels unfair, because I wasn’t chasing her or trying to break no contact, I was put in that situation against my will.

Now I feel like I can’t even walk by the café without guilt or awkwardness. Everyday I am forced to walk by the cafe and I see my ex. I lost a safe place that was mine, a place that helped me heal, and losing it because of an ex feels like a giant punch to the gut.

**Has anyone else dealt with an ex taking away a neutral space in your life? How did you process it? Why does she not want me there? Does she still have strong feelings, is she not over the break up? Does she hate me that much? I have so many questions, and I am literally lost and hurt.**",10,1758551696.0,ExNoContact,10,1.0,False

My friend asked if she could park in my driveway to walk there with the new guy she has been seeing for about 2 weeks. I’ve had plenty of friends park in my driveway for similar events over the years, and I have absolutely no problem with this. 

However, this particular friend has been really overbearing and clingy for a few months now and I’ve been trying to create kore distance and boundaries between us as much as possible. She kept asking if I’d be home, suggesting I meet the new guy she’s seeing or meet them for a drink after the fair. First of all, I think it’s too soon for her to be introducing him to her friends given that it’s the third date, and second of all, I had other plans. I told her I wouldn’t be home during the day and wasn’t sure when I’d be back. I intentionally stayed away all day to avoid her. 

I often leave my main door unlocked because I live in an extremely safe neighborhood, but I locked my door yesterday because I had a feeling she would come up with a reason to want to use my bathroom or something. Sure enough, she texted me saying she had to use the bathroom and asked if I had a spare key because the door was locked. I didn’t answer because I was busy, and didn’t see the text until later. Three hours after the first text, she texted me again that she “totally broke into your upstairs door because I had to pee so bad and it was unlocked”. Mind you, I had never answered the first text. So, I had apparently left open the upstairs door which is up a fire escape and leads to my office. That door is typically always locked because I don’t really use it, but I used it that morning to take out the trash. 

I am beyond angry and feel really violated. I had made soup from scratch that morning and left my kitchen a mess because I had to rush out, knowing I’d clean it later that afternoon, which I wouldn’t be comfortable with someone seeing. On top of that, I don’t know if she let this man into my apartment who I’ve never met and she barely knows. I have a cat that likes to slip out the door sometimes, so then I had to worry about him getting out during her unexpected visit. For even more context, there is an ice cream store right next to my apartment, two coffee shops, a bar, and two restaurants within a minute walk from my apartment, all with bathrooms that she could’ve used. 

I am struggling with how to address this with her, because I have a feeling she’ll minimize it and say she didn’t think I’d care, and that she wouldn’t care about my messy kitchen, etc. ",33,1758551591.0,AmItheAsshole,64,0.85,False

Ive never been big on breakfast, always ended up eating around 11-12p for a long time now. Figured having a bigger lunch and dinner would be better and just coffee in the mornings would be fine... but since ive been actively attempting to lose weight since january of this year, i would literally be watching the clock until 11a every morning WAITING to eat. 

I'd eat a 5-700 cal lunch at 11 then around the 1-5p period would just snack and snack and snack and rack up calories cause I couldn't seem to stay full. Then be left with like 2-400 cal for dinner just to repeat the process the next day lol. 


Last week I said fuck it and made a little spam, egg, spinach wrap with a carb balance low carb/high fiber wrap one morning around 8a and wasn't hungry at all until almost 1. Ate my 4-500 cal lunch and next thing i know its 430 and I hadn't had a single snack. I was full all day! Tried out the same the rest of the week and same results, I wasn't hungry during the 1-5p period anymore. So I guess im converted and am a breakfast eater now, lol.


I eat pretty decently, my usual roster for my lunches/dinner would be like protein/fiber, filling stuff - eggs, tuna, chicken, salmon, beef, pork, fruit, veggies, potatoes, Greek yogurt, etc. For snacks i like things like beef jerky, sunflower seeds, sardines, cheese/turkey/ham wraps, popcorn, rice cakes, boiled eggs, pickles, etc... Around 1600-1900 cal a day.. So its not like im eating horribly but I just could not figure out WHY I was always so hungry during the 1-5p period EVERY DAY.


So that all being said, what are some of YOUR favorite breakfast foods that are quick to make in the morning, or can be prepped for the week the night before? 😁 


So far ive stuck to breakfast wraps (eggs, protein, spinach/lettuce if we have it, Greek yogurt mixed with olive garden Italian dressing for a 'sauce'), protein bagels and cream cheese,  overnight oats made with oatmilk, chia seeds, granola and fruit.",26,1758551580.0,loseit,26,0.94,False

I see a lot of comments on other posts about what is available so I thought I would make a quick post based on what I experienced. 

**Entering**: There is an initial bag check, followed by another bag check and metal body screener. Dump your water bottles out before going in but they have refillable stations which was fab and I didn't have to pay for water. I liked the double check - made me feel safer. 

**Merch**: Look for workers that have a tall ""Merch Line Starts Here"" and get in line. There are 2 merch spots - one you will see closer to the entrance on the left and another near the bathrooms farther back to the right. I got in line at maybe 6:15ish. Line moved QUICKLY - so many ppl working there. When I got to the front, EVERYTHING was available in EVERY size. I snagged the Shigella shirt ($45) and the brown subway hoodie($85). For sizing, I am a M/L (short and curvy) - I got medium in both. The Shigella shirt is THICK. Nice material, was surprised. Also a bit boxy so the M was great instead of a large. The merch customization had booths next to the line to the left near the front - didn't notice if there was another booth at the second merch location.

**Stuff to do:** There are a few step & repeats. The lines for these were LONG. Moved much slower than the merch lines lol. I didn't wait in those lines but you will see them immediately. They are directly next to the merch booths at the front left. Theres a bunch of other photo op moments if you don't want to wait in line. Theres smaller head-in-holes ones across from these step and repeats - the merch line will hide those but there was no line for them. The banners hanging from the outside of the stadium when you walk towards it is a great place for photos. There is a Poppi lounge where you can get the soda or a fusion drink - so cute. There is a coffee/cocktail place too. The normal food & drink selections are there as well. I liked just walking around the stadium and stopping at the pop ups and booths. Truly a beautiful stadium.

**Crowds**: Let me say that this stadium was WAY less anxiety inducing compared to MetLife, MSG, etc. The way everything is spread out outside is ideal. The crowds of people were so respectful. Honestly. Please & thank yous everywhere, people being mindful of spaces... just fab. And the workers at the venue were the nicest people I have ever encountered. BATHROOMS - lines look insane but they FLEW. Truly a good amount of stalls. There are stalls and then urinals - urinals had no lines (shocker) but don't be fooled by the long bathroom lines. They MOVE. I was in section 302 - note that when the show is over, it took quite a bit of time to get down. It seemed that the bottom sections all climbed up to the portal doors and then the top was just stuck. Once they cleared out we were able to move. Just a PSA but it moved eventually like 10 mins.

**Timing**: First performer was right at 6, second performer was 6:50is to 7:30 (these are general, I was roaming around at these times lol) and then Chappell went on directly at 8:20 and was done at 9:55.

LMK if you have any more questions - first time at this stadium so I don't know the ins and outs but overall a great experience. The weather also had a factor in that ;)",6,1758551523.0,chappellroan,7,0.88,False

A month ago I was diagnosed with N2 after yearssssss of struggling with falling asleep randomly. Seemingly it happened once in a blue moon but the last year I have been falling asleep nearly everyday at my (work from home) desk. In the middle of meetings, listening to music/podcasts, doing actual engaging work, honestly doing anything. I can't live like this anymore. 

I am falling behind at work because I can't stay awake! I don't think anyone has noticed or they haven't said anything to me but I am worried I'm going to be fired. 

I asked for a simple accomodation of more breaks to support excessive daytime sleepiness per the sleep doctor. HR wants me to fill out some ADA paperwork that is SO invasive that I don't feel comfortable. 

Before you ask, why not try meds!? I have ADHD, POTs (history of PVCs in my heart which needed surgical intervention), high blood pressure and a slew of other conditions along with mental health issues and neurological issues. N2 is yet another diagnosis this year alone. 

Sleep Dr asked that I speak with my cardiologist and a few other doctors to see if it was safe to take stimulants or other type meds for N2. All doctors said, ""no it's not safe for you to do that, please seek more info from sleep Dr!"" I talk to my sleep doctor again this week. Last time we spoke we said take naps or micro naps as needed. 

Well if I did that I'd be sleeping ALL DAY!  I literally cannot take this anymore. It's different on the weekends where I actually have time to nap for as long as I need but Monday through Friday I can only really take an hour nap (on my lunch) unless I just fall asleep at my desk by accident. 

I know disability is hard to get for N2 but honestly I don't know how I'm going to hold this job for the long term unless I can get this random falling asleep in check. 

I have tried a standing desk: I have/will fall asleep standing up at my desk, I've tried a walking pad while working: I just get more tired, I've tried loud music/podcasts/videos: that's not enough to keep my attention I fall asleep anyways. I'm out of ideas. I've tried other suggestions from other threads, none work for me. Caffeine/coffee doesn't really do much and I can't have a large amount anyways due to my heart.

And that's when it hit me:💡 I quit smoking bc I have ADHD. That's it.
I've never been able to explain to people how I ""did it"", but I legit just woke up one day and had lost interest in it. Woke up one day, over it entirely, and that was that... after about 5 years on/off.

Just like I woke up one day and was over skittles after eating them onessively for 2 years, same with my Bollywood era, and noodles era, and my K-drama era, and my Nollywood era, and and and.

•micro- sketchy
•path-pathoma first 3 chapters 
•biostats and ethics- Randy Neil and dirty med
•revision period- mehlman pdfs for IMMUNO, NEUROANAT, ARROWS 

Preparation:
Started preparation one year back, honestly my prep should’ve been faster but unfortunately I made a huge mistake of not focusing and being lazy with my prep. 
Please do not do so and be truthful to you and DONT BE LAZY WITH PREP

Dedicated period: two months in which I revised all my weak concepts did uworld 3blocks per day and then started giving NBMEs
My NBME scores:

8/8  25- 64%
15/8  26- 60%
17/8  27- 70.5%
20/8  28- 64.5%

26/8  31- 79.5%
 28/8 (3 days before the real deal)Free 120- 70%
29/8 32- 72%

My scores were soo unstable which scared me alot 
Had breakdowns seeing the initial nbme scores. 
What helped me increase my score was reviewing all the incorrects and making notes of them(i never made any notes in my entire prep except nbme incorrects) and mehlman

Exam day: prayed tahajjud alot for one week before exam and honestly maybe thats the only thing that helped😭😭 
Woke up early, again reviewed my incorrects notes (got one or two exact qs) had a light breakfast and reached the centre early
Skipped the demo and started the exam right away

EXAM: got frightened on the first q itself idk if it was lack of knowledge or confusion for a new place but my first two blocks were BAD 
Flagged some ten qs in them but then had a five min break had a few sips of coffee and started with third block and luckily from there it went well
It is true that the stems are REALLLYYY LOOOONG but it was doable 
Exam as a whole was obviously new but was a little similar to nbmes
Didn’t feel too bad after the exam 
Had a feeling that I might have marked all the wrong options😭😭 but yeah

We picture coffee-fueled founders coding next to whiteboards in cities with impossible rents. But the truth is, the most potent driver of innovation isn’t capital or code — it’s displacement.

Diasporas — often treated as victims or remittances — represent an untapped, distributed engine of reinvention. Their lives span systems, their perspectives blend survival with ambition, and their identities are forged in contradiction. They understand brokenness **intimately**, but also what function feels like. This collision — of frustration, loss, skill, memory, and hope — creates the rare conditions for true societal innovation: not just better apps, but **better systems**.

# Why Existing Nations Struggle to Change

Every nation today is a web of sunk costs. Bureaucracies, infrastructure, regulatory frameworks, and political inertia drag down even the best ideas. Want to redesign health care? Education? Housing? Energy? Too bad. You’ll face a wall of stakeholders who benefit from doing nothing.

Displacement breaks those walls. Not just metaphorically, but physically. When people leave, or are pushed out, they carry **untethered insight** — uninvested in the legacy systems of their origin, and uncommitted to the stagnations of where they land.

This isn’t just cultural; it’s structural. A displaced engineer isn’t just cross-cultural. They’re **cross-infrastructural**. They’ve experienced roads, energy grids, courts, hospitals — across three continents. They’ve lived under corrupt regimes and social democracies. They know what works, what’s theater, and what’s a scam.

# The Perfect Storm Conditions

Displacement brings:

* **Perspective**: Comparison enables critique. Without it, dysfunction is normalized.  
* **Frustration**: No one changes anything without pressure. Diasporas live under emotional compression.  
* **Detachment**: Without loyalty to broken systems, reinvention is emotionally possible.  
* **Diversity**: Not the HR slogan. Real, epistemic diversity from surviving multiple worlds.  
* **Urgency**: For diasporas, failure is not theoretical — it’s generational.  

And this storm hits precisely **as the world already has most of the solutions** it needs — stored in neglected patents, ignored innovations, or political no-go zones. The displaced are among the few who could implement them — because they have the least to lose, and the most to gain.

# From Flight to Framework

So what if we treat displacement not just as a wound, but as raw material?

Instead of waiting for ""stable countries"" to adopt obvious solutions, we treat diasporas as the **early adopters of systemic change**. They don’t need to invent the wheel. They just need a road — and the will to drive over old maps.

When viewed this way, the Return Nation is not a rescue project. It’s not nostalgia, or repair. It’s a **launchpad** — using the pressure of dislocation to escape the gravity of stagnation.

date ordered 19th sep. 
date of roast on package: 20th sep. 
date of delivery: 22nd sep. 

here's my issue. 

I've ordered ground from other roasters and these bcr grounds seemed to be less fragrant and feel very degassed for a 2 day old ground

in the past whenever I've got new fresh coffee grounds the smell fills the air and room and lingers for a long time but not here 

the grind is also on the finer side 

it's a medium-dark roast and I tried a test brew as soon as they arrived (I know they should be rested more technically but i suspect stale stock) and was quite under welmed at the output

i also tested them out in a different brewing method to see how much crema came out and they creme far less than some of the older coffee grounds I have

they also have a lot of fines , I think I'll have to use a filter paper inside the south indian filter

So, the age old question that’s asked 100 times - should you have sex on the first date? 

Some background first - both early 30s (I’m F, he’s M) I’ve been single for over a year, him over 2. I’ve had sex on the first date and yes it’s not the best. I’m trying to switch it up though and lately haven’t been having sex on first dates because I am trying to do things differently to see if I get different results. So for the past 6 months first dates intentionally been for coffee or brief walk. 

So yeah, not ideal with the distance. He lives very remotely. We’re both open to moving though long term but haven’t pegged anything down because of course *we haven’t even had a first date yet*. Trying to get schedules to work is a bit difficult for us both due to work, but he has a window open and I have a bigger one so I offered in that time to travel to see him. I wouldn’t usually do this as I feel as a woman it can come off as a bit desperate which I’m not - but what I’m looking for in a partner has proven hard to find. Rather than wait another month to meet him and potentially waste both of our time and effort, I want to meet him in person sooner rather than later (plus keep the momentum going). We have good chemistry over the phone and have spoken a couple of times for hours and not realised the time go by! 

I’ve booked a hotel (with free cancellation) for when I visit which he knows about. I’m on the fence about using this if the date goes well, as it would likely be a while until I see him again. Like many people, I enjoy sex and sexual compatibility is very important to me. My previous marriage was a 14 year dead bedroom situation. Although I wouldn’t expect the first time to be perfect, I kinda want to know what I’m working with. 

He’s been respectful throughout, not a hint of a dick pic has been sent and I feel like he genuinely values me. He did offer me to stay at his place but I explained I like to feel “in control” and “safe”. (Last year I made a very bad rookie error of going to someone’s house to watch sports together at night. He had a spare bedroom and I only went over under the understanding that if I didn’t feel the vibe, I could stay in that room. Well, I went into the spare room, he texted me “want to come through” and I pretended to be asleep. He came into the spare room anyway and asked to “cuddle”. I didn’t feel safe to say “no, go away” so I ended up fawning.) 

Anyway, what are your thoughts? I appreciated it’s a very nuanced topic, but I’m looking for some opinions and will see how people vote for the most popular opinion. My main worry - does it look desperate if I’m travelling a 4 hour one way (8 hour total) journey already for a first date and sleep with him? Or just generally bad for LTR. Or do I use my hotel room anyway and wait longer for intimacy and build up anticipation, even though it will likely be 3/4 weeks til I see him again? 

Side note - if there is a second date, I won’t be travelling all the way up to see him again. I’d want him to come all the way to see me or at the very least meet in the middle. I’m holding firm on that.

You know how some mornings feel like you're trying to push a boulder uphill before you've even had your coffee? I used to feel that way literally, every time I made a cup. I’d be standing there, bleary-eyed, both hands on the plunger, leaning into it with all my weight. It was like a morning workout I never signed up for, and the coffee grounds always put up a fight.



I remember thinking it was just part of the process, a necessary struggle for a decent brew. My knuckles would be white, and I’d have to press down in these tiny, jerky motions, worried the whole thing would suddenly give way and spray hot water everywhere. It felt less like a peaceful ritual and more like a delicate, high-stakes negotiation with a stubborn piece of kitchen equipment.



The whole thing changed for me when a friend casually mentioned the grind. I’d been using the same pre-ground coffee I used for my drip machine, not thinking twice about it. He saw me struggling one morning and just said, ""Ah, that's a grind that's too fine. It's like trying to push through sand."" It was one of those small, obvious-in-hindsight details that completely shifts everything.



So the next time, I asked for a coarse grind, like rough breadcrumbs. The difference was night and day. The plunger sank down smoothly, with a gentle, steady resistance that felt right. There was no fight, just a quiet hiss. It turned the whole experience from a chore into something actually pleasant.



Now, that initial struggle is just a funny memory. It’s funny how the smallest detail, something you’d never even think to question, can be the key. The whole process is just… calm now. I set the timer, pour the water, and when it's time, the press feels satisfying instead of stressful. It finally makes sense.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

if you want to see Actual Purpose of human life then see this link : ( triple w ( d . o . t ) asitis ( d . o . t ) c . o . m  {Bookmark it })

1nnnoo6,https://i.redd.it/bgecet7q5qqf1.png,"Life: The Complication Theses

The Simple Truth Behind Our Complicated Story","

# I. Ape Roots, Human Minds

1. **We Are Still Primates** However exalted our civilizations, humans remain members of the primate family — evolved from creatures who swung through trees and fought for fruit. We often pretend otherwise.
2. **99% Chimp** In 2005, genome research confirmed it: we share approximately 99% of our DNA with chimpanzees. What separates us may be less biology, more belief.
3. **Language: The Great Divider** What truly differentiates us isn't tool use or opposable thumbs — it's language. Without it, we struggle to shape meaning, transmit memory, or build culture.

# II. Why We Tell Stories

1. **Narrative = Navigation** Without goals or beliefs, we’re intelligent apes spinning on a rock. Stories give us direction, coherence, and a reason to keep moving forward.
2. **Words Are Tools** Language allows us to teach, argue, inspire, and confess. It builds civilizations and destroys them. It gives shape to our invisible thoughts.
3. **Faith in Shared Knowledge** Few of us verify scientific truths personally. We trust that gravity exists, atoms behave, and Earth orbits — based on consensus, not direct proof.
4. **Time Is Fiction (And That’s Okay)** Birthdays, calendars, and ""New Year's Resolutions"" are human constructs. The universe doesn’t care. But we do, and that's what matters.

# III. Religion: Our Ancient Operating System

1. **The First Framework** Religion was humanity’s first language for existential inquiry — a symbolic architecture for good, evil, suffering, and wonder.
2. **A Philosophical Case for God**
   * Imagine the greatest possible being.
   * If that being exists only in thought, it is not the greatest.
   * Therefore, such a being must exist. *(Anselm’s Ontological Argument simplified.)*

# IV. Science & Belief: Not Enemies

1. **Two Ways of Knowing** Atheists and believers both seek truth. Science asks *how*, faith asks *why*. Together, they form a more complete inquiry.
2. **Scientists of Faith** Galileo. Newton. Faraday. Early pioneers often viewed scientific pursuit as an act of reverence — a decoding of divine design.
3. **Today’s Science: Autopilot Mode** Science no longer needs religion to function. But its origin story is undeniably theological.

# V. The Speed of Light vs. Human Progress

1. **Snail’s Pace Evolution** We spent thousands of years mastering fire and agriculture. Now we’re playing with quantum AI and CRISPR gene editing in one generation.
2. **Explaining the Divine Without God** Some argue that invoking a god is no longer necessary to explain lightning or disease. Natural processes suffice. Others still hear the thunder and see meaning.
3. **Generation Warp** Our grandparents saw the world through radios. We carry the internet in our pockets. These shifts do more than change tech — they reshape our minds.

# VI. The Limits of Knowing

1. **Language = Meaning Engine** Whether you pray or program, language is how we define our reality. It forms the basis for every moral code and scientific theory.
2. **Science & Religion Fall Short** Neither camp can fully explain love, death, compassion, or injustice. Both stumble when faced with raw human suffering.
3. **Humanity Is Still Iterating** We’re not finished. We’re still adapting, still learning. New tools, new crises, new stories. The next draft is already being written.

# VII. In the Torrent of Time

1. **Information Overload, Wisdom Deficit** We scroll endlessly — yet forget the basics. History. Empathy. Perspective. We must remember what it means to remember.
2. **Still Just Us** For all our machines, satellites, and algorithms — we are still humans: tribal, brilliant, flawed, beautiful.

# Final Thought

1. **Be Kind — It’s the Only Real Law** Whether you believe in God, the multiverse, or the perfect cup of coffee — this much is true: we are all just trying to make it. So walk gently. Love boldly. And leave the planet a little better than you found it.",1,1758550582.0,WRXingaround,0,1.0,False
