1qo9wog,https://www.reddit.com/r/MindsetConqueror/comments/1qo9wog/how_to_quit_social_media_without_losing_your_mind/,How to Quit Social Media Without Losing Your Mind: The Science-Based Guide That Actually Works.,"I spent 3 years researching digital wellbeing, dopamine addiction, and attention economy because I noticed something disturbing. My friends couldn't sit through a 10-minute conversation without checking their phones. I couldn't either. We were all technically ""connected"" but fundamentally alone, scrolling through highlight reels while our real lives passed us by.

Here's what nobody tells you: social media isn't designed to be quit. Tech companies hire literal neuroscientists and behavioral psychologists to make these apps as addictive as slot machines. The average person touches their phone 2,617 times per day. That's not a personal failing, that's brilliant engineering exploiting your brain's reward system.

But here's the good news: once you understand the mechanics, you can reverse-engineer your way out. 



*Understand Your Brain Is Being Hacked.*

Dr. Anna Lembke's book ""Dopamine Nation"" changed everything for me. She's Stanford's addiction medicine chief, and this book breaks down how social media creates the same neural pathways as cocaine. Sounds dramatic,and but the data is wild. Every like, comment, notification triggers a dopamine hit. Your brain craves more. Rinse repeat until you're checking Instagram in line at the grocery store.

The book explains why going cold turkey often fails: your dopamine-starved brain rebels hard. Instead, she recommends a 30-day total detox followed by mindful reintroduction. This reset is crucial. Best neuroscience book I've ever read on addiction, hands down. 



*Replace the Habit, Don't Just Delete.*

Downloaded an app called One Sec that forces a breathing exercise before opening social media. Sounds gimmicky, but it creates a ""speed bump"" that interrupts the autopilot behavior. Suddenly, you're aware you're about to doomscroll for the 47th time today.

James Clear talks about this in ""Atomic Habits."" You can't just remove a bad habit; you need to replace it. He's a behavioral researcher who studied habit formation for years. The framework is simple: identify your cue (boredom, loneliness, procrastination), replace the routine (scrolling with reading, walking, calling a friend), and keep a similar reward (stimulation, connection, distraction).

The book has this great concept called ""habit stacking"", attach your new behavior to an existing one. Like ""after I pour my morning coffee, I'll read for 10 minutes instead of checking Twitter."" Sounds too simple to work, but behavioral science backs it up completely. 



*Understand What You're Actually Missing.*

Most people fail because they think they're quitting ""staying connected."" You're not. Cal Newport's ""Digital Minimalism"" (he's a comp sci professor at Georgetown) argues that social media is a poor substitute for real connection. The research is clear: passive scrolling increases loneliness and depression. Actual face-to-face interaction or even voice calls reduce it.

Newport recommends a 30-day digital declutter where you remove all optional tech, then slowly reintroduce only what serves your values. He interviewed hundreds of people who successfully quit and found they all rediscovered hobbies, deepened relationships, and got bored, which is actually healthy for your brain. 



*Track Your Progress Tangibly.*

I started using an app called Freedom to block social media during work hours and after 9 pm. You can customize schedules, and it works across all devices. Seeing my ""hours reclaimed"" counter hit triple digits was genuinely motivating.

For the data nerds: Moment tracks your phone usage automatically and shows you how much time you're actually wasting. Most people guess 2 hours daily, but the average is closer to 5. Seeing the actual number is sobering af.

If you want something more engaging than blocking apps, there's also BeFreed, a personalized audio learning app that turns book summaries, research papers, and expert insights into bite-sized podcasts. 

You can customize everything from voice (including a smoky, sarcastic option that's genuinely addictive) to depth, anywhere from a 10-minute summary to a 40-minute deep dive. It pulls from psychology research and behavioral science content, so you're essentially replacing mindless scrolling with actually useful stuff about habit formation and digital wellness. 

The app works well during commutes or gym sessions, times when you'd normally reach for social media. Built by a team from Columbia and Google, it's designed to be genuinely engaging without the manipulation tactics. Worth checking out if you need a healthier replacement habit. 



*The Reality Check.*

Quitting social media doesn't fix your life overnight. But it gives you back something priceless: attention. The ability to read a full book, have a complete conversation, and sit with uncomfortable feelings instead of numbing them with endless scrolling.

Your brain will protest. You'll feel FOMO. You'll convince yourself you ""need"" it for work or keeping in touch. But here's what I learned from 6 months off: the people who matter will text you. The opportunities you're ""missing"" are mostly imaginary. And boredom, once you stop running from it, is where creativity lives.

The attention economy is literally designed to extract your time and sell it to advertisers. Every minute you reclaim is an act of resistance.",1,1769508533.0,MindsetConqueror,0,1.0,False

Am still recovering and welcome tips to reduce CO2 gas, cough after surgery.

I was diagnosed with multiple large fibroids two of them were measured to be 8-9 cm but turned out to be 12cm each. Surgery was minimal invasive Laproscopy Myomectomy which lasted 5hr30min.  I was told it would take 3 hr or max 4 and if it were to take longer than that they would prefer to cut it open and the open Myomectomy. 

I also developed cough after my surgery so that contributed a lot on slowing down my progress and suffered everything possible due to Anesthesia usage.  

Day 1

Surgery starting 10:30 AM till 3:30 pm, didn’t get conscious till 5:30. Lasted for 5.5 hr

Had serious irritation in throat due to breathing tube. Woke up with catheter . Couldn’t talk or move. Severe leg pain.( due to the position they hold us in for surgery)

Was recommended to not drink anything till dinner time. Stay in elevated sleeping position 

Asked to introduce to sip of water -one spoon at a time until I stopped piling it out which only happened after midnight. 

Once water intake got stable I kept the water intake steady. 

Day 2

Next morning soft food with tea/ coffee 

Wasn’t able to eat more than a couple spoon full. Had to chew really well. 

Started talking a lil, was allowed to turn or move. Later allowed to walk for a couple minutes. 

Once I was able To walk they asked if I could pee by myself so they can remove the catheter. And they did. I did notice bright red bleeding in my diaper. Afternoon I was able to eat lil more than before ( rice, lentils soup)  there were many injections though the day 1-2 but it was getting added to the IVdrip. 

I was able to feel my bladder and was able to excrete urine with no burning sensation.

All in all I noticed a lot of spotting on Day 2. 

Day end with warm mashed rice with lentil soup. As IV continued 

Day 3

They noticed that the IV wasn’t going well enough into my veins. So they tried to flush the drip tip with help of syringe. But it leaked out and ended up with a swollen palm. 

They had to change the IV drip tip from right hand to Left hand. 

The last small drip was left that was of strong antibiotic but got allergic reaction on my left hand. They had to stop the drip and give me anti allergic medicine. Continued to drip the Iv.

Once done they kept it for next day just in case I experience any puking. Experiencing cough and irritated throat as soon as I get sleepy, coughing makes stitches painful.

No gas or poop passed. 

Day 4

Trying to walk and drink warm water but only gas was passed. Noticed blood and mucus as I passed the gas. Bleeding is constant, doctors said it could be due to anesthesia as prolonged use irritates of bowel more. Finally after lunch I saw solid poop and passing gas without any liquid/mucus. 

Coughing got worsen, couldn’t sleep because of that, now doctor presume Ayurvedic cough syrup as  already on a lot of chemicals.  It helped. 

Burping and farting increased significantly after lunch. Had trouble sleeping because of cough but doctor suggested to take cough syrup so it helped a lil. Feeling extremely cold, shivering and lil fever. 

Day 5 

Had a good sleep, coughing but still slept well 

Still seeing vaginal bleeding, a lot of gas and bloating! 

Finally had a huge solid poop without any help of laxative so that’s a good sign 

Stitches hurt like ant bites, probably because of strain from coughing or maybe it’s drying out. Mouth feels wayy bitter than it has ever been. 

Feeling better than all the days combined.

It keeps the same spirit but focuses on the topic **“coloring book adult pdf.”** The link appears three times with strong calls to action as requested.

**When Was the Last Time You Colored Just for Yourself? 🎨🧘‍♀️**

You know that feeling when your mind won’t stop racing — deadlines, phone notifications, life being, well… *life-ing*?  
That was me a few months ago. Then someone handed me an adult coloring page and said,  
“Just try this for ten minutes.”  

Ten minutes turned into an hour.  
I wasn’t thinking about bills or my to-do list — I was just matching colors, breathing, and existing in the moment.  

That’s the exact energy behind this **Adult Coloring Book PDF** I’ve been working on:  
A mix of relaxing mandalas, floral escapes, and mindful abstracts made for grown-ups who need a break but don’t want to stare at another screen.  

Before I mention where you can find it, here’s a little perspective you can apply *right now*:  

• Coloring isn’t childish — it’s scientifically proven to reduce stress and activate meditation-like focus.  
• It offers the calm of yoga without needing stretchy pants.  
• You can do it anywhere, anytime… even while waiting for your coffee to brew.  

I’ve heard from people who now use coloring as their wind-down ritual — a small, colorful pause in an overstimulated world.  

So I decided to make this available free for our Reddit community.  
👉 **Download your free Adult Coloring Book PDF here:** [https://cashflowmanifest.com/Free-ebook](https://cashflowmanifest.com/Free-ebook)  

Each page was designed to help you unplug, breathe deeper, and remember that creativity is not just a hobby — it’s self-care with a splash of color.  

If you know someone who’s been feeling burned out or stuck in autopilot, share this with them.  
👉 They can get the free copy here too: [https://cashflowmanifest.com/Free-ebook](https://cashflowmanifest.com/Free-ebook)  

And because doing something nice for yourself should never feel like work…  
Grab your pencils, pour your coffee (or wine, no judgment), and give ten minutes back to your creativity.  

👉 **Here’s the free download once more:** [https://cashflowmanifest.com/Free-ebook](https://cashflowmanifest.com/Free-ebook)  

If this small act of coloring helps even one person feel calmer today, that’s a win worth every shade of blue. 💙

Advice requested,"My FA (F28) and I, Anxious leaning to secure (M33) went no contact for 45 days after she asked for some time and space. I respected it 100% and retreated (I have been learning about attachment theory and I was a somewhat aware this was a potential outcome)

We have been in a platonic friendship for a while, I do have feelings for her,  we dated a few years ago, I switched jobs and moved out our city, we reconnected 4 years later (last spring) as I have been back to our old city for work trips. I reached out, we started texting and eventually facetiming, We met in her city, spent the whole weekend together just going out places, then she drove 7 hours total to come to see me at another city for my birthday and we kept going visiting each other. 

towards the end of the year, I noticed she was pulling away much more and I tried to have ""the talk"" to address it (my mistake, I know) I tried to keep it low pressure but basically ""hey I notice we've been quite distant for the past few weeks and I'd like to close the gap if you let me"" at first she received it very well, apologized and recognized it and said she can't offer more at the moment but she does not want to let me go either.

A week later, fights with her best friend and troubles at home (one of her parents is sick), I reached out to ask her if she was doing ok, my anxious side was activated at this time after a few ""seen"" messages and while nothing attacking or so was said, she said ""I need time and space, this is not about you but it will make you good too""

Before this point I had ordered some personalized christmas gifts for her and her cat and I retreated as soon as I saw that message to give her space just saying ""ok, FYI towards the end of the year you should get something in the mail, it was ordered last week, you don't need to reach out for it if you don't want to, I just want you to have it""... and left

I was not blocked during this whole time (I am still not)

45 days later I sent a low-pressure message saying:

""*Hey, I hope you are doing great. it's been a while since we talked and I have respected completely your need for space. But I do not want to leave things up in the air so I'd like to reach out before the distancing becomes greater and I don't know where we stand.*

*I appreciate you and please feel free to reach out when you can. it is not urgent but I would like to know your thoughts on it.*""

She replied 24 hours later with a 7 minute long voice message (message transcription below) but the thing that is confusing me is some of the wording because it is like ""I can't but..."" so I would love to hear from this community that certainly knows a lot more than I do about their thoughts...

**My main question is... if she's discarding me or is this just a deactivation / demoting the friendship to something more manageable for her. Advice is highly appreciated.**

THE TRANSCRIPTION:

\*\*""\*\****Hi OP, how are you? Sorry for the delay, I wanted to reply to you earlier but I wanted to do it properly and calmly, and now I’m here in the car, so I’m going to send you a voice message. First of all, thank you so much for the gifts. They really made me feel good. Honestly, The cat's gift was not bad at all- everything arrived good. I truly appreciate it so much.***

***you really didn’t have to, no need to give me anything or buy me anything, but still… thank you so much for the gifts, and happy belated Christmas.***

***I hope you’re doing well and that they haven’t made you work too much. I guess the season is a bit crazy, so I hope you haven’t been overloaded with work. I hope everything has gone well. You said you were away for a month and a half, so I hope the return back to (CITY) is going well and they’re not making you work too much.***

***As for me, I’ve honestly been pretty disconnected lately. I’ve been reconnecting with myself and, surprisingly, with God too, honestly. I’ve reconnected with my faith quite a lot. I’ve been going to church and I’m in a moment of calm and peace. Even though nothing has changed regarding my family situation and everything. I think maybe I’m seeing things differently, or I’m starting to understand them, or to learn how to live through the process of (CHRONICAL ILLNESS) in the family.***

***So yeah… I guess I have to protect my peace, because it’s taken me a lot to get here. And even though it hasn’t been easy at all, I think I’m approaching everything in a different way now.***

***And also… that’s why I wanted to send you a voice message, because obviously you’re not the same person you were in (YEAR WE DATED) and neither am I. And I think we both understand that clearly. So I’m sending you this audio so you can hear my voice calm and chill, because you know texts can be misunderstood. And in the end, because of the affection we have for each other, the appreciation and everything, this feels more valid, you know? So to speak.***

***And right now, honestly, I’m being completely sincere: I can’t carry more than what I already have emotionally. And right now I’m okay, and I need to keep being okay and stay at peace. I don’t mean that our friendship has taken away my peace. I think that with the last conversations, I felt a lot of anxiety, and now with a bit of perspective, I guess I did things wrong and you did things wrong. This isn’t about blaming anyone at all. It’s just that… with some perspective, I realize I can’t maintain that bond in that way, and I’ve come to understand that.***

***I don’t want there to be any resentment between us, not at all, you know? One hundred percent respect from my side, and I know from yours too. On my end, I can’t promise we’ll have a connection again and fluid communication, honestly. But if you want, when you come to (FA's CITY), text me and we can have coffee near our offices, and if you want we can talk. You can tell me how you’re doing, I’ll tell you how I’m doing, and everything.***

***But right now (nervous giggle), I don’t want to force anything either, you know? I don’t want to be misunderstood, okay? But I think I’m good right now, and I think you’re good, and everything is perfect in that sense. So yeah… I don’t want to go on too long. I don’t know if you understood me. You know I explain myself terribly, especially when I’m nervous, and it’s hard for me to express myself, and this conversation isn’t easy for me either.***

***So yeah, like I said, when you come to (FA's city), write to me if you want and we’ll talk. And on my end, truly, everything is fine. No drama at all, everything from respect, affection, friendship, and all that. So yeah. That’s my response. And once again, thank you so much for the gifts. Truly, you know you didn’t need to do anything at all.***

***But thank you so much for the gesture, and yeah, I really appreciate it. And yeah… hugs and a kisses. Bye.""***

My take is to not pressure my FA, she said she has no bandwidth and I get that, I also don't want to lose her either but I also not putting myself the wrong expectation that things will improve soon. so I will send a low-pressure text before I travel to her city something like: ""Hey FA, I will be there next week and I will be busy but Wed-Thu afternoon works for me if you still want to catch up. if you can't, for whatever reason it's totally fine too""

what do you all think? is it closure or deactivation and demoting to something more casual?

1qo9k3h,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1qo9k3h/aitah_for_abandoning_my_pregnant_hungry_and_broke/,"AITAH for abandoning my pregnant, hungry, and broke friend?","The title sounds crazy but let me explain. Sorry in advance for the long read. My husband (22m) and I (21f) had a couple friend Lydia (23f) and Ethan (21m). (Fake names) My husband and Ethan are distant childhood friends. They both enlisted in the same branch of the military right after high school and loosely kept contact. 

My husband and I moved to a new state per military orders several months ago and we were excited to learn that Lydia and Ethan were stationed at the same base. As we were looking for apartments to live in (off base), Ethan invited my husband saying “Our complex has openings, it’d be fun to be neighbors, come live at our complex!” My husband and I liked the complex and thought living close to friends would be fun, so we agreed. All four of us were excited as the constant movement of military life can cause isolation. 

For a couple months, we would hangout all the time. Dinner nights together and hanging out at our apartment pool. I got closer with Lydia and we occasionally did some girl things like getting coffee or shopping. Most commonly, I would let Lydia come over to our apartment to do laundry since my husband and I payed extra for an in-unit washer/dryer. We’d spend the day chatting and giggling. It felt like Friends in real life. 

However, some things were weird. The first time I hung out alone with Lydia, she told me that her best friend, Shayla, heard she was making another potential friend and had a panic attack at the thought of Lydia leaving her for other friends. Lydia and Ethan would constantly fight with Shayla and her husband, then come to my husband and I to complain about them. It wasn’t until later that my husband I realized Lydia and Ethan would really only hangout with us when they were fighting with Shayla and her husband.

In the midst of our sort of Friends-type life, life got rough for Ethan and Lydia. Lydia got pregnant, “sort of accidentally, sort of on purpose.” Ethan stopped getting payed. (This is a common occurrence in the military. Sometimes they will accidentally over pay you, and once the error is caught they withhold your paycheck until all is paid back.) Then a couple weeks with still no pay for Ethan, the government shut down, halting any paperwork movement to get him paid again. One of their cars broke down and the other one had expired tags. The only usable vehicle they had was Ethan’s motorcycle, which he needed to take to work. Lydia worked a receptionist job with anywhere from 8-16 hours a week. They were not married so they weren’t receiving housing allowance. According to them, their relationship was rocky before all of this started happening. 

At our pool hangouts, they really would only talk about how much they were financially struggling. My husband and I did our best to be a listening ear. Sometimes the vibe seemed to be a guilt trip hinting that they wouldn’t mind if my husband and I lent them some cash. However, we’re barely keeping our head above water, so we did our best to be supportive and encouraging emotionally. When their car broke down, I was more than happy to help drive Lydia to work. I only work occasionally so I had the time to drive her and was excited to finally be able to help them in some way. Plus, she only worked 1-3 days a week.

The rides taking her to work took a sad turn, quickly. One day, she spent the whole car ride crying about how hungry she was because they couldn’t even afford food at this point. I was sad and scared for her and her baby, so that night my husband and I anonymously ordered some basic groceries to their door. No body ever said anything so I’m not sure if they ever knew it was us. 

The next time I picked her up she cried the whole ride again because all they had at home was frozen pizza and root beer. Only 2 things in their fridge. This broke my heart so I told her once I picked her up from work in the evening, I wanted to drive her to a local food bank. She said it would be too embarrassing, so I suggested that I just go into the food bank myself and get some things to give to them. She said that was still too embarrassing and they “weren’t ready to accept help yet.” 

This continued for another week or two. Every time I would pick her up there would be another terrible thing or hungry day due to their finances. My husband even compiled a list of some resources that the military offers for situations like this. There are all kinds of food banks, resource centers, etc. Yet every time there was some excuse as to why they couldn’t seek help yet. 

My husband even found a Navy and Marine Corps Relief Society loan. The loan was a $1000 pay day loan at 0% interest, specifically because withheld pay is such a common experience. I told her about this, so excited for some help for them. She said “$1000 isn’t even enough to do much for us right now, so no.” This was my last straw. $1000 ISNT ENOUGH. ARE YOU KIDDING? And it’s 0% interest, there’s literally zero reason not to take it. $1000 could feed them for a couple more weeks until Ethan got paid again. Not to mention you could set aside a couple hundred to maybe get a mechanic so they could start to function on their own again, and stop getting g rides from me.

The car with expired tags had out of state plates. Apparently at the beginning of this mess she called the DMV in the other state and they told her she’d have to get new tags in person. I’m pretty sure she just needed to ask around some more, because I have gotten new tags and plates over the phone from the DMV in the same state. I even explained this to her but she brushed that off as well.

I didn’t mind taking her to work at first. But it got to almost two months of taking her to work about 3 days a week. It would take two hours out of my day since it was a 30 minute drive and I was dropping her off and picking her up. I never asked them for gas money considering their situation. I’m happy to give my time and help, but I needed them to start making some sort of active effort to help themselves for me to keep helping them. I wasn’t doing it for recognition, but it also bothered me that I got only 1 initial thank you over this whole time period. 

Even after a grace period to get past the initial shock, I felt like Lydia had ample time to help herself yet did nothing. It was frustrating for me to see her not feed her baby, yet cry about it when she had so many options. So I did it, I ghosted her from giving her rides to work. One time I ignored the message and the other time she genuinely just asked for the ride too late. It took a couple times and she got the hint that I wasn’t taking her anymore.

The cherry on top: when I stopped taking her, Ethan stopped answering my husband’s texts. A couple weeks after not talking to them, my husband found out that they had a courthouse wedding through a Facebook post. My husband was hurt that despite what was happening with me and Lydia, his childhood friend and neighbor didn’t even bother to text about them getting married. To make it even better, a couple days later we saw another post showing that Shayla and her husband were at the courthouse wedding. 

At first I felt justified, telling myself I could only help her as much as she was willing to help herself. But recently I’ve started to feel convicted like I may have done the wrong thing. Am I terrible for abandoning her when she still needed someone? I have no idea how she got to work after that. Was she still in a situation that required help rather than tough love? I’m writing all of this because I want to hear everyone’s honest opinions on whether or not I am TA. I want to know if I should text her to apologize and rekindle or if I should consider myself lucky to be away from that.

I'm gonna one and done this account because the one I actually spend my time on is for fun and destressing. I'm very stressed and pissed off, along with my head feeling like it's full of fuzz so be warned this isn't gonna be as coherent as I would.

My boyfriend (26-m) and I (25-f) asked a close friend of ours to house sit and take care of our cat for a week while we went out of state. We were visiting my mom, who had just had heart valve surgery, so it was already very stressful, and we were trusting her completely to take care of our place and our cat for the time being.

To be clear my boyfriend is Indigenous and I’m white. Our friend is vegan. We are not vegan, but we are super careful about where our food comes from. We get meat and dairy from local farmers and butchers we personally know, who treat their animals well. My boyfriend was raised with a huge focus on animal welfare, especially by his mom, so this isn’t careless or thoughtless on our part.

She’s known all this for years. She’s eaten at our place, stayed over, hung out, and never made a big deal about our choices. Nothing suggested this would ever be a problem. This whole thing took us by the surprise and took a huge bite out of our asses.

We were gone a full week and when we got back, it was late and we were exhausted, so we didn’t notice immediately. The next morning I went to make coffee and realized all the milk was gone. Then I checked more carefully and saw all our meat and other dairy were gone too. Even a bottle of honey from the pantry was missing. Not moved somewhere, not hidden, just straight up fucking gone.

When I went to feed our cat and realized her food had been completely replaced with some kind of vegan alternative. I don’t even know what it was, but it definitely wasn’t what we left. Since we’ve been back, our cat has been acting off and won’t eat normally, lethargic, just not herself. We’re honestly thinking about taking her to the vet because I’m scared she’s sick from this.

We tried calling and texting our friend and couldn’t reach her for hours. When we finally did and asked why she’d thrown out our food and swapped the cat’s food, she completely lost it. She started going on about how eating animal products is violence, that ethical sourcing doesn’t matter, and framed us as morally corrupt no matter what we do. She said my boyfriend was betraying his people by participating in colonial systems, and then called both of us together  necrophile colonizers.She also accused us of being obsessed with death and domination over animals, and said I was supporting misogyny by participating in farming.

She then also admitted, I guess, that seeing our male-female partnership was disgusting to her and she wished she had known better before becoming friends with a bislut in her worlds.

I tried to tell her she had no right to throw out our food, and especially no right to change our cat’s diet without asking. I also tried to explain that saying those things about my boyfriend and me, given our identities, was completely unacceptable. She didn’t care at all, said what she did was right and then blocked both of us

I’m so pissed off right now but I also can’t stop thinking maybe something is actually wrong with her. Maybe she’s having some kind of psychotic break or a severe episode? I can’t tell if this is just her being ideological and extreme or if she’s actually losing touch with reality. It doesn’t make what she did okay with destroying our food, messing with our cat’s diet, calling us what she did, and saying so many racist and misogynistic things, but I keep wondering if maybe this is just bigger than us.

She acted completely normal when we left and there was nothing leading up to this, and now everything’s a mess and I can’t stop thinking maybe something is actually wrong with her which just makes me feel angry and confused and a little guilty at the same time.",0,1769506981.0,amiwrong,12,0.4,False

If you’ve ever wondered if it’s worth the hype, here is the breakdown of the science and the benefits.

# What exactly is it?

Unlike regular green tea where you steep the leaves and throw them away, with Matcha, you drink the **entire leaf**. This provides a significantly higher concentration of nutrients. It’s shade-grown to boost chlorophyll and L-theanine, which gives it that vibrant neon green color.

# 1. The ""Super"" Antioxidant (EGCg)

Matcha is one of the highest sources of catechins. Specifically, a catechin called **EGCg** which is known for its cancer-fighting properties and ability to reduce inflammation.

# 2. Focus Without the Jitters

This is the game-changer for me. Coffee can cause that ""caffeine crash"" or heart palpitations. Matcha contains **L-Theanine**, an amino acid that crosses the blood-brain barrier. It promotes relaxation and reduces stress while the caffeine gives you energy.

* Result: **""Calm Alertness.""**

# 3. Metabolic Boost

Studies show that drinking matcha can increase your metabolic rate. It helps the body burn fat more efficiently during moderate exercise (thermogenesis).

# 4. Heart and Liver Health

Regular consumption is linked to lower LDL (bad) cholesterol and triglyceride levels. It’s also been shown in some studies to help protect the liver from oxidative stress.

Insbesondere ja wegen der krassen Zeitverschiebung konnte ich nicht darauf verzichten. Leider gab es im Hotel keinen richtigen Kaffee sondern nur so eine Schokomischung und 2 Teesorten auf dem Zimmer, deshalb musste eine Lösung her.

Im nächstgelegenen 7Eleven dann konnte man Kaffee kaufen: frisch zubereitet aus dem Vollautomaten (von einem Mitarbeiter quasi), abgepackt oder auch zum selber zubereiten wie auf dem Bild zu sehen ist.

Für das selber zubereiten stand dann heißes Wasser zu Verfügung und man konnte sich das Pulver direkt vor Ort einfüllen und dann das ganze bei der Kasse abrechnen lassen.

Haken allerdings, das ganze war in der Form ziemlich teuer. Das habe ich einmal gemacht und dann war mir das zu blöd, dafür fast genau so viel wie in Deutschland auszugeben (wo doch in Thailand eigentlich alles wesentlich günstiger ist)

Am nächsten Tag dann nochmal hin und ich habe gesehen, dass die Kaffee Stangen auch nen Barcode drauf hatten. Ich also damit zur Kasse, scannen lassen und siehe da: nur 1/3 des Preises vom ganzen Kaffee. Für das Wasser wird also erheblich viel mehr in Rechnung gestellt.

Dann hab ich mich erstmal mit einem Wochenvorrat dieser Beutel eingedeckt und war gut versorgt.

Ist das Alman-mäßig oder einfach nur auf (vielleicht extreme) Sparsamkeit getrimmt?

But she has this close bond with her former boss, she worked with her for 2+ years and created a bond with her son. The son is 22 as well and I haven’t met the guy but she talks about what they did together a lot.

At first I wasn’t suspicious but now I’m just really confused. She would say things like the guy and her would get coffee together almost everyday. They would attend concerts together almost every month. They would also grab food together as well. Also do a bunch of different activities together like cruising along the beach and go carting. Which didn’t throw me off the loop. She would also talk about him as a person like he likes this and that. Or she’ll be like “yea he did this for me one time” and other things of similar things.

She also wears a hoodie that he gave her that has his brand on it and she wore it around me. I asked her oh that’s a sick hoodie, then she proceeds and says “Yea he gave it to me, it has his brand on the back”. At first that didn’t throw me off because I mean it’s just his company (Btw he partially owns a shop that works on cars that she likes as well).

But recently her sister found out an artist my girlfriend and I might go on a tour soon. For me this one of my favorite artist of all time. Shes knew that from the moment we were talking because we kind of played around saying “you don’t know the artist like I know the artist” and etc.

When her sister said “Yall trying to go to his concert” I said I was down but my girlfriend goes “Yea I’m gonna ask him (ex bosses son) because I promised him and him and I are gonna go together if he ever does a tour. so I’ll text him and ask if he’s trying to go with me.” At first I was like damn okay then the artist got brought up again today at the gym and this time she double downs and said “Yea him (ex bosses son) and I are gonna go together, but I totally forgot to ask him” that’s when I felt kind of ehh.

I honestly don’t know how to feel about the situation because it just seems like she really wants to go with him and she just talks about him to me all the time idk how to feel about it, any thoughts?

TL;DR: My girlfriend has been talking about this guy that’s my age to me and now wants to go to a concert with him.

Edit: I forgot to add this but they would not do things together while we were talking nor in a relationship. When she talked about these things, it happened years before we got together.",1,1769506167.0,relationships,8,0.67,False

I often see foreign YouTubers making these amazing coffees, grinding beans, using fancy machines, very aesthetic vibes and all 😅

I’m not a hardcore coffee person. I’ve mostly had regular instant stuff like Nescafé, Bru, etc. I’ve traveled to a few South Asian countries but didn’t really try coffee there, and I haven’t been to Europe or the US yet, so I don’t have much exposure to “good” coffee.

Right now, I’m a heavy tea drinker, proper masala chai with milk and sugar, multiple times a day. I’m planning to start working out and want to cut down, so I’m switching to black tea (no milk, no sugar). I’ve tried plain espresso once, and honestly… it was pretty rough for me 😬

So my question is:

I want to ease into good coffee, or at least understand what people mean when they talk about real or good coffee. What would you recommend for a beginner like me? Beans, ground coffee, brewing methods—anything. Flavoured options are totally fine too.

1qo94ly,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomentumOne/comments/1qo94ly/the_psychology_of_life_that_actually_works_44/,The Psychology of Life That Actually Works: 44 Science-Based Lessons (No BS),"Look, I spent my 20s doing everything ""right"" and still felt lost as hell. I was that person refreshing job listings at 2am, doom-scrolling through everyone else's highlight reel, wondering why I couldn't figure out basic adulting.

Then I realized something. Nobody teaches you the actual playbook for life. Not school, not your parents, not those self-help gurus selling courses. So I spent years reading everything. Psychology research, memoirs from people who actually did interesting things, hundreds of hours of podcasts. I talked to therapists, career coaches, random wise people at coffee shops.

Here's what I learned that actually moved the needle. The stuff that made me go ""oh SHIT, that's why nothing was working.""

**On Career & Money**

* **Your 20s are for experimenting, not optimizing.** Everyone acts like you need to have it figured out by 25. Bullshit. Most people who love their work tried 5-7 different things first. The anxiety you feel about ""finding your passion""? That's capitalism talking, not wisdom. Try stuff. Fail at stuff. Learn what you hate. That's valuable data.
* **Learn to negotiate everything.** I left probably $200k on the table in my 20s because I was too uncomfortable to ask. Read ""Never Split the Difference"" by Chris Voss. Former FBI hostage negotiator breaks down exactly how to ask for what you want without feeling like a dick. The book won multiple awards and Voss literally used these tactics to save lives. Now I use his ""tactical empathy"" approach for everything from salary negotiations to splitting rent with roommates. Life changing doesn't even cover it.
* **Build ""fuck you"" money.** Even $5k in savings changes your brain chemistry. You stop tolerating toxic jobs, bad relationships, situations that drain you. Start with anything. $20 a week. Use an app like Qapital that automates savings with rules like ""round up purchases to the nearest dollar."" Removes the willpower component entirely.
* **Income is a skill you can learn.** Not just ""work harder."" Learn actual valuable skills. Copywriting, basic coding, video editing, sales. Pick one. Get decent at it. Suddenly you have options. The people making bank aren't necessarily smarter. They just learned skills the market values and got comfortable asking for money.

**On Relationships & People**

* **You're the average of the 5 people you spend the most time with.** Cliche but true as hell. If your friends are negative, broke, and going nowhere? You'll unconsciously match that energy. It's not about being an asshole and ditching everyone. It's about intentionally seeking out people who are building the life you want. Join communities. Go to events. Reddit meetups, book clubs, whatever. Put yourself near people doing interesting things.
* **Most people are running on autopilot and projecting their shit onto you.** That person who criticized your choices? They're probably terrified of making bold moves themselves. Parents who don't support your dreams? Usually because they killed their own dreams and seeing you go for it triggers their regret. Read ""The Four Agreements"" by Don Miguel Ruiz. Tiny book, massive impact. The second agreement is ""Don't take anything personally"" and it'll save you years of emotional damage.
* **Set boundaries or people will set them for you.** I spent my 20s being ""nice"" and wondering why I felt resentful all the time. Boundaries aren't mean. They're essential. Use the app Finch for building this habit. It's a self-care pet game that sends reminders to check in with yourself and practice saying no. Sounds silly but it actually works.
* **Everyone's faking it.** That person who seems like they have their shit together? They're anxious too. They just got better at hiding it or stopped giving a fuck what people think. The sooner you accept that everyone's just winging it, the sooner you stop comparing your behind-the-scenes to everyone's highlight reel.

**On Mental Health & Self-Awareness**

* **Therapy isn't for ""crazy"" people.** It's for people who want to stop sabotaging themselves. I wasted 5 years repeating the same relationship patterns because I didn't understand my attachment style. Read ""Attached"" by Amir Levine and Rachel Heller if you keep choosing the wrong people or pushing away the right ones. Completely rewired how I show up in relationships.
* **Your body keeps score.** That anxiety, those random physical symptoms, that feeling of being ""stuck""? Often it's unprocessed emotions living in your nervous system. ""The Body Keeps the Score"" by Bessel van der Kolk is dense but revolutionary. It explains why traditional talk therapy sometimes doesn't work and what actually helps release trauma. Every therapist I know recommends this book. For practical daily tools, try Insight Timer. Free meditation app with tons of somatic experiencing exercises that help you actually process emotions instead of just thinking about them.
* **Stop trying to think your way out of feelings.** You can't logic yourself out of depression or anxiety. Emotions need to be felt and moved through your body. Cry. Scream into a pillow. Go for an angry run. Dance it out. Sounds dumb, works great.
* **You're probably not broken, you're just dysregulated.** Most of what we call ""mental illness"" is actually nervous system dysregulation from stress, trauma, or just living in this chaotic world. Learn about polyvagal theory. The podcast ""The Overwhelmed Brain with Paul Colaianni"" breaks this down in super accessible ways. Understanding how your nervous system works is like getting a user manual for your brain.

**On Productivity & Habits**

* **Discipline is overrated. Environment is everything.** I used to beat myself up for lacking willpower. Then I learned about environment design. Make good choices automatic and bad choices hard. Want to read more? Put books everywhere and delete social media apps. Want to eat better? Don't buy junk food. Atomic Habits by James Clear is the bible for this. Clear breaks down the psychology of habit formation better than anyone and gives you actual systems that work.

Another tool worth checking out is BeFreed, an AI learning app built by Columbia alumni and former Google engineers. It pulls from books, research papers, and expert interviews to create personalized audio content based on what you actually want to learn. You can type in something like ""become better at setting boundaries"" or ""understand my attachment patterns,"" and it generates a structured learning plan with episodes you can customize from 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives. The voice options are surprisingly addictive, there's even a sarcastic narrator if that's your thing. It helped me actually retain the concepts from all these books instead of just passively consuming and forgetting.

* **Stop consuming, start creating.** Even if you're not ""creative."" Write shitty poetry. Make terrible TikToks. Build something with your hands. Our brains need to make things, not just passively consume content. The constant input without output makes you feel empty and purposeless. I started writing random thoughts in a notes app and it helped me process life more than years of scrolling ever did.
* **Rest is productive.** Hustle culture is a scam designed to burn you out so you're too tired to question the system. The most successful people I know are obsessive about recovery. They take real breaks. They sleep. They have hobbies. Productivity isn't about working more hours, it's about working on the right things when your brain is actually functioning.
* **Time blocking > to-do lists.** To-do lists are aspirational fiction. Time blocking forces you to be realistic about what's actually possible. Use Google Calendar like a real schedule. ""Write report"" becomes ""Monday 9-11am: Write report."" Game changer for actually getting shit done.

**On Life Philosophy**

* **Comparison is the thief of joy.** Yeah yeah, everyone says this. But seriously. Someone will always have more money, better abs, a cooler job. The only comparison that matters is you vs you yesterday. Delete social media for a month and watch your mental health improve dramatically. I did this and realized I was spending 3+ hours a day feeling bad about my life for literally no reason.
* **Regret minimization framework.** When making big decisions, imagine yourself at 80 looking back. Will you regret trying and failing, or not trying at all? Usually it's not trying. Most people regret the chances they didn't take, not the ones they did. This single framework helped me quit a soul-sucking job and move across the country.
* **Everything is figure-out-able.** You don't need to have all the answers before you start. You'll never feel ""ready."" Just start and figure it out as you go. Every skill you have now, you once sucked at. Every challenge you've overcome, you once thought was impossible. Trust yourself more.
* **Life comes in seasons.** Sometimes you're in a growth season and everything is hard but you're expanding. Sometimes you're in a rest season and you need to consolidate gains. Sometimes you're in a dark season and you're just surviving. All seasons are temporary. All seasons are necessary. Stop fighting the season you're in.
* **The meaning of life is whatever meaning you decide to give it.** There's no cosmic plan. No destiny. Just you, making choices, creating meaning from chaos. That's both terrifying and liberating. You get to decide what matters. You get to write your own story. Stop waiting for permission or a sign. You're the author.

**On Health & Body**

* **Move your body every single day.** Not for aesthetics. For mental health. 20 minutes of walking does more for depression than most medications. You don't need a gym membership or fancy equipment. Just move. Dance while making coffee. Take the stairs. Park far away. Make it stupid easy and do it consistently.
* **Sleep is non-negotiable.** Every night I got less than 7 hours in my 20s, I was basically operating drunk the next day. Bad decisions, emotional reactivity, inability to focus. Protect your sleep like your life depends on it because it kinda does. Keep your room cold and dark, put your phone in another room, stick to a schedule.
* **Sitting is the new smoking.** If you have a desk job, you're slowly destroying your body. Get a standing desk. Set hourly movement reminders. Do stretches. Future you will thank you when you're not dealing with chronic back pain at 35.

**On Money & Lifestyle**

* **Experiences > things.** Every single piece of research shows experiences create more lasting happiness than material purchases. That trip you're putting off? Take it. That concert? Go. That random Tuesday dinner with friends? Say yes. You won't remember the new phone in 5 years but you'll remember the spontaneous road trip forever.
* **Invest in tools that save time.** Good shoes. A decent mattress. Quality kitchen knives. Stuff you use every day. Cheaping out on daily-use items is expensive in the long run when they break or make your life harder. This isn't about being materialistic, it's about respecting your time and energy.
* **Automate everything possible.** Bills, savings, investments, even grocery delivery. Every decision you have to make depletes willpower. Remove decisions. Create systems. Free up mental space for things that actually matter.

**The Actual Truth Nobody Tells You**

Here's the thing I wish someone had told me at 24. You're not supposed to have it figured out. The people who seem like they do are either lying or got lucky. Most of life is just showing up, trying shit, failing, learning, and trying again.

You don't need a 10-year plan. You need to know your next step. That's it. One foot in front of the other. Be a little bit braver than yesterday. Make slightly better choices. Learn from your fuckups. Forgive yourself faster.

The world will try to convince you there's one ""right"" path. Get the degree, get the job, get married, buy the house, have the kids, retire, die. Bullshit. There are infinite paths. You get to choose yours. And you get to change your mind. Multiple times. That's the whole point.

Nobody's coming to save you. Nobody's going to hand you the life you want. You have to build it yourself, piece by piece, choice by choice, day by day. And yeah, that's scary. But it's also the most empowering thing you'll ever realize.

You're not behind. You're not too late. You're exactly where you need to be to start building the life you actually want. So start. Today. Right now. One small choice at a time.",1,1769505789.0,MomentumOne,0,1.0,False

Thank you for reading.

Hi everyone,

I’m looking for advice on how to handle a workplace situation that’s really affecting me mentally.

I’ve been in my role for some time and have passed probation. I previously worked under three different team leaders with no issues raised about my communication, behaviour, or performance.

Since the end of 2025, I’ve been under a new team leader and have experienced ongoing issues with how I’m spoken to. On multiple occasions, I’ve been told things like “be quiet,” “stop talking,” “shh,” and “stop talking and listen to me.” I was also told “use your brain a little” (twice in one conversation). In one instance, the team leader admitted she took her frustration out on me because she was tired, working late, and hadn’t had coffee.

I ask questions at work purely to seek clarification and ensure I’m doing tasks correctly, but this has been repeatedly framed as me “pushing back” or “questioning authority.” I’ve explained that this isn’t my intention and never has been.

One incident escalated to the point where I cried because I was being reprimanded for things I genuinely didn’t believe I’d done wrong. Being spoken to angrily by someone in a position of authority is something I find very distressing.

I raised this with another manager, explaining the pattern, the exact phrases used, and the impact it’s had on me. I shared that I now feel uncomfortable speaking up, that I second-guess myself constantly, and that it’s affected my mental health.

After this:

The team leader apologised, but also said her communication is “direct” and that my communication is the issue

The apology felt generic and didn’t acknowledge specific behaviour

A potential move away from the team was discussed but didn’t actually happen

I was left feeling blamed, unheard, and emotionally worse than before

I’ve since taken a wellbeing day because I’m struggling mentally and feeling anxious about work. Adding to this, it’s really difficult for me to leave this role. This job pays significantly better than most comparable roles, and I’ve been actively applying and interviewing since mid-2025, completing countless interviews without success. Walking away isn’t a simple or safe option for me financially, which makes this situation even more stressful.

I’m trying to understand:

Is this considered reasonable workplace behaviour, or am I being gaslit?

How do you protect yourself when you speak up respectfully and it’s turned back on you?

What are your options in organisations with limited or unclear HR support?

At what point do you escalate vs quietly plan an exit?

I genuinely want to work collaboratively and receive feedback, I just don’t believe anyone should be spoken to this way at work.

Any advice or perspective would really help. Thanks for reading.",1,1769505617.0,Advice,2,1.0,False
1qo920b,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodylanguage/comments/1qo920b/unsettling_workplace_drama/,Unsettling workplace drama,"I’m a 34-year-old brown woman, a software engineer for nearly a decade at a large tech company. I’m a very competent engineer, receive very strong feedback 1:1 among peers and bosses, but I struggle to be vocal about my wins or contributions at work - a mix of refusal to boast and laziness really.

I joined my current team about 16–17 months ago.

A major source of confusion has been my dynamic with a product manager (let’s call him Dan). He is a white American male, about 10 years older, married with kids, and very well-liked and respected on the team.

When I first joined, Dan seemed to deliberately ignore or avoid me - zero to minimal eye contact, and little engagement, which affected me emotionally. Over early 2025, interactions between us became awkward. There were moments of prolonged eye contact that felt tense, and I experienced a brief sense of attraction that I did not act on. I know he felt it too because he would choke on his words and lose his train of thought. On days I looked nicer, he would take his time looking at me in hallways or in meeting rooms. I’m pretty sure others noticed, but i pretended to be looking elsewhere to avoid contact. I noticed behaviors that confused me: him staring during meetings, appearing flustered when speaking to me, or intentionally blocking me in his peripheral vision to avoid distraction. I tried to avoid eye contact and keep things professional.

In June 2025, during a team offsite (golfing), he seemed to deliberately de-escalate the tension by being casual. After that, we had a more neutral, polite dynamic - saying hi in hallways, less awkwardness.

In late September, I worked directly with him on a project he owned. I authored a design doc, reviewed it with him and stakeholders, and the work was broadly well received. He acknowledged the quality a few times but not consistently. I focused on professionalism and hoped the work would speak for itself. In one meeting with stakeholders, he was just looking at me for several seconds from across the table. I looked up at him after a while, and he immediately looked away like someone who was caught staring 🤷‍♀️. Later, about a month after, I was clarifying some requirements with him and he referred to that meeting as “I remember we discussed this in a meeting and I remember because I was staring at you”. I didn’t react and kept the conversation focused on the work topic.

After he returned from leave in January, his behavior shifted again :/ he became cold, avoided eye contact, and did not acknowledge me. Around this time, a new teammate (call her Rosie) joined. He was openly enthusiastic, playful, and warm with her - waving hello, praising her work frequently and very loudly, sometimes repeatedly in front of me. For example, when we used a tool she built, he said things like “Rosie is the best” multiple times in a row. This felt performative and confusing, but he’s also someone who is very loud when he’s excited.

It’s been extraordinarily confusing. I’m not easily excited, and I’m generally pretty timid. I don’t have clever things to say in a conversation. I’ve been working on building empathy, and am hyper self aware. I think I just don’t understand why the coldness, and why in the middle he couldn’t stop checking me out, and then was able to be mostly professional while working together with minimal staring and tension, and now back to just coldness. It is really bothering me. I want to have a good working relationship with him. I am decent friends with people on my team, we don’t over share but we enjoy a cup of coffee together every once in a while. I’d like to be comfortable around Dan like I am with others.

I wrote a lengthy post recently about my relapse, my struggles with ruining my relationship with my wife and kids, my business going under, and just about everything else in between. The words of encouragement publicly, and the people who messaged me privately just to talk, were absolutely incredible.

Well, just about two months of sobriety later (trying to get back to my previous 5-year streak), I’m still here. I’ve recently picked up work doing some AI training since my body isn’t allowing me to be much of a farmer at the moment—and maybe never will again.

Things were going well for about a month. I was working, thinking clearly, and even exercising daily the best I could. I thought I was on the up-and-up, but I woke up Saturday morning barely able to talk, walk, or hold anything. Slurred speech, dropping silverware—I could barely make it around the backyard. HE had set in heavy for no apparent reason. I made it back to the ER and sure enough, my ammonia levels were headed north and my spleen was enlarged. My numbers were still as bad as they were last December, but strangely not as bad as they were in March, right before I decided to say 'f\*\*\* it' and drink again. Anyway, I’m back on the lactulose; not my drink of choice, but that’s the way it goes.

I see a lot of newcomers or family members come in here to get a more in-depth knowledge of how this works or what MELD scores mean. There’s really one universal truth to this life with this ailment, and it simply is…

It’s going to suck. I wish there was something better to say, but there’s really not. I’ve been to the bottom with a MELD score of 38—swollen limbs, the belly of a mother expecting triplets, not able to walk or eat, colostomy bags, and catheters. I’ve lost everything, rebuilt, and lost it again. I’ve crawled back to a MELD score of 10 living the healthiest lifestyle possible, only to have it spike out of nowhere. It sent me into an unprecedented HE flare that led to a relapse and losing my family.

But I’ll let you know one other thing… it’s better to go down fighting than letting it take you down without one. Drinking is easy. Giving up is easy. But it’s better to be the person who accomplished something against the odds than to be forgotten as the person who just quit trying.

It’s going to be hell, but there are good days. That one meal you had the other day that didn’t make you feel like vomiting; the fresh smell of coffee brewing in the morning to remind you you're still alive; that friend or family member who checked up on you even when you didn’t want to talk to anyone. Hold on to those moments. Deep down, you know there aren’t a whole lot of people who can even imagine what you’re going through every hour of the day, but they try anyway.

Hold on to the ones who aren't scared to be in the midst of your internal and external turmoil, and cherish anything you have left to hang on to.

I don’t know—I guess I needed to hear that when I wanted to give up, and I hope it helps someone else not give up, too",5,1769505413.0,Cirrhosis,1,1.0,False

My setup is as follows:

ZP6 with burr lock at 0, usually set around 5.5

Water dialled to \~70GH & 25KH

Usually naturals and washed coffees on the lighter side but never ultra light.

Temp at 91 for natural and 93 for washed.

Plastic 02 V60

Cafec Abaca papers. 

I usually do a 15g dose, 50g bloom to 45s and then one continuous medium height pour to 240g for washed and 225g for natural. 

I level the bed without a swirl but a 12 to 6 jiggle and a 9 to 3 jiggle(if that makes sense). Really found that this cuts out astringency and overall gave smoother cups.

But that's the issue, I get often smooth cups that aren't harsh but they lack character and any sort of flavour punch. Sometimes I manage it but those cups are few and far between.

Typical drawdowns are around 01:50.

I do chase flavour separation hence getting the ZP6 and would love to atleast taste something in a cup rather than the generic coffee taste that is slightly sweet, that I tend to get.

I have experimented with different waters, TWW full strength & half strength, my own which I mentioned above, tried T90 papers, grind sizes from 4.0 to 6.5. 45 second to 01:30 blooms.

I used the large Context Window of Gemini Pro as the CPU (Logic) and the Hard Drive (Storage).

The ""Context Database"" Protocol:

I think of the chat history as my ‘Server’ . I write the current “State” in JSON and a “User Action” in plain English to the AI, and I ask it to calculate the new State.

The Prompt:

JSON Current State (JSON):

{
  ""user"": ""Dhruv"",
  ""wallet_balance"": 500,
  ""inventory"": [""Old Laptop"", ""Coffee Mug""],
  ""active_quests"": [""Sell Laptop""]

User Action: ""I want to sell the Old Laptop to a stranger for $100.""

You are the State Manager.

Task:

Validate: The user can do this? (Yes, he has the laptop).

Exit: Updating the balances and lists.

Output: NO OTHER MEMBER than the re-run JSON block.

I've found that the most efficient way to upgrade instructions is to let the LLM handle the engineering itself.

I’ve been using a specific **Meta-Refiner** that forces the AI to act as a Senior Prompt Engineer. It doesn’t just rewrite the prompt; it analyzes why the original was failing first.

# The Template: The Prompt Refiner

>

# Why this structure works:

* **Weakness Analysis:** By making the AI identify ambiguity first, it avoids simply ""beautifying"" the text and actually solves logic gaps.
* **Chain of Thought (CoT):** It ensures the model processes the reasoning steps before providing the final instruction set.
* **System Instructions:** It creates a ""reusable"" output that you can drop into a System Message or a prompt manager later.

Hope this helps some of you clean up your workflows. What other meta-prompts are you guys using to automate the engineering process?

This is my first post on this subreddit. I hope it follows the posting rules, even though it’s neither a modern machine nor, strictly speaking, a true “espresso” ratio.

Over the past two weeks, I’ve been tasting the Rosa blend (80% arabica, 20% robusta) from Tanat, precisely because it contains robusta, which supposedly makes it easier to get crema with this kind of machine. And also because this type of blend is, I believe, closer to a traditional Italian-style coffee. And I have to say, it’s a very pleasant bean to drink.

So I was wondering if anyone here uses this type of machine? I hope to be able to ask a few questions in the future to improve my technique.

I’m planning a trip to Marrakech from 13 to 16 February and I’d love to meet some cool people to explore the city together.

I already have a nice plan: visiting the Medina & Jemaa el-Fna, rooftop cafés, Bacha Coffee, Bahia Palace, Majorelle Garden, souks, and maybe a day trip (Atlas / Ourika Valley / desert vibes). So it’s not just random, it’s well organized but still relaxed and fun.

About me: I’m friendly, open-minded, and easygoing, I like meeting new people, good conversations, coffee, walking around the city, taking photos, and just enjoying the travel vibe.

If you’re in Marrakech around these dates and want to share experiences, laugh, explore, and make good memories, feel free to message me. Let’s make a small group and enjoy the trip together! 🌍✨",2,1769503767.0,Marrakech,1,1.0,False

I often see foreign YouTubers making these amazing coffees, grinding beans, using fancy machines, very aesthetic vibes and all 😅

I’m not a hardcore coffee person. I’ve mostly had regular instant stuff like Nescafé, Bru, etc. I’ve traveled to a few South Asian countries but didn’t really try coffee there, and I haven’t been to Europe or the US yet, so I don’t have much exposure to “good” coffee.

Right now, I’m a heavy tea drinker, proper masala chai with milk and sugar, multiple times a day. I’m planning to start working out and want to cut down, so I’m switching to black tea (no milk, no sugar). I’ve tried plain espresso once, and honestly… it was pretty rough for me 😬

So my question is:

I want to ease into good coffee, or at least understand what people mean when they talk about real or good coffee. What would you recommend for a beginner like me? Beans, ground coffee, brewing methods—anything. Flavoured options are totally fine too.

She looks for microphones in the apartment, does irregular shit she wouldn’t do normally, randomly cries, stays up way too late under the week (like 3-4am), places bowls of coffee powder everywhere, says shit that hardly makes sense or doesn’t make sense at all (like we all being the same and that were made of stardust and that everything is dynamic and has two sides) randomly in a conversation and dances like a true maniac raising her hands and pointing at random angles in the apartment multiple times a day. She turns lights on and off randomly, hums songs to calm herself down etc. and can’t even use the radio anymore. She put all her cds out of the casings to arrange them in some order and just made a mess with them. 
it’s gotten to a point where she comes into me and my brothers room at night to caress us but she just wakes us up and startles us because it’s scary af.

Today morning she was talking about chocolate and couverture in the entrance of our apartment without any context. She also said that she saw me in her reflection insulting her.

I highly suspect that she’s having a weed induced psychotic episode again as she never had a psychosis or was acting like this before starting to smoke it.
How could I help her and what measures should I take to get her to a medical professional? She already said she doesn’t want help :(

He's been sitting on this enterprise SaaS idea in the HRTech space for months. Good idea too - validated with potential customers. But he can't code much.

So he started getting quotes.

The developer route?

\> Senior devs wanted $120K-150K a year plus equity. Even juniors were $80K+. But it's not just the salary - it's the commitment. What if it doesn't work? He was worried about bleeding cash every month on payroll while trying to figure out if anyone will pay for his product.

Dev agencies?

\> Cheapest quote: $23,000. Most expensive: $47K. Timeline? 3-4 months. And any changes after delivery? Extra. Always extra.

Then he found this AI coding thing.

He took a $500 course on Agentic spec coding - basically using specialized AI agents to build software without being a developer.

A month later, he had a working MVP. Not a prototype. An actual product he's testing with real users.

The math:

* Devs: $120K+ per year
* Agency: $23K, months of waiting
* His way: $500, one month

What surprised him most: The speed, flexibility, and scalability. With an agency, every change takes days or weeks of negotiation. Now he iterates in hours. Idea in the morning, tested and fixed by dinner.

This isn't magic. Rohan had frustrating nights because of the lack of experience with spec coding. Things broke. You still need to understand what you're building - the AI doesn't think for you.

Three years ago, non-technical founders had to learn to code for years or raise money. Now there's another path. Not replacing developers for complex stuff, but for getting an MVP out there? Absolutely game changing.

What would you build if you didn't need to raise millions of $ in funding first?

1qo8bvi,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qo8bvi,My accidental setup,"About three years ago, I gifted my girlfriend with a cheap espresso machine from Lidl (about  80€ / £70 / 95$) because I thought it would be fun to be able to make espressos at home. I started getting into coffee, but felt limited by that machine, and eventually my girlfriend got me a new a new, more capable espresso machine: a Breville Barista Mini\*. My setup is as follows:

* It's a little sturdy machine with a 58 mm portafilter, a tank which holds almost 2 litters and a consistent flow. The manufacturer claims it has a 15 bar bomb, although I seriously doubt the 15 bars are used to push water through the coffee grounds as I've had no problems with spraying or channeling, as would be expected. It takes about 30 seconds to heat up. The construction is mainly aluminium and plastic, and there's not as much flexing as I would've expected. It's a good machine for everyday use, not as fancy as some of the things in this subreddit, but it gets the job done, is easy to clean, and as you can see it is compatible with bottomless portafilters.
* My mom got a bunch of coffee shop equipment for free from a friend of hers that was closing a bar. She casually mentioned having two industrial grade coffee grinders gathering dust at her garage. I went and found she had a huge coffee grinder, which would obviously be too big to use at home, and a smaller coffee grinder that had only been for decaf espresso. It's a Spanish brand called Cunill ('rabbit' in Catalan), they make good grinders. This one is worth about 500€ brand new, has flat burrs and came with only 30 uses as per the counter in the machine's menu. The burrs are good for about 500 kg (110 lbs) of coffee, according to the manufacturer. The grinder itself has a continuous dial and can be programmed to grind coffee in increments of 0.1 seconds, which is more than enough to get doses of 18.0 ± 0.5 grams.

As you can see, there are some other coffee & tea artifacts in the middle shelf, but that's not for espresso :)

I'm very happy with this simple setup, as it's enough to make about 4-5 coffees a day. We get our coffee from a local roaster and switch origins often, and I'm currently learning how to make latte art with… mixed results, as you can see. I've never attempted to use regular milk, and it's proving difficult to get oat/soy milks to the right texture. So far the barista blend from Oatly is the one I'm having more success with, but my technique is still far from good.

Thanks for reading :)

\* Breville is the name of two separate, independent brands. The Breville most people think of is the Australian manufacturer, which sells their equipment under the name of Sage in Europe. This is due to the fact that there was an older preexisting British company called Breville who had the name rights. The one I'm referring to is the European one, which also sells their equipment also under the name Oster and Sunbeam to avoid clashing with the Australian Breville/Sage.",11,1769502890.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

A lot of ice cream makers seem to like doing dairy-free flavors in January. As far as food-based New Year's resolutions go, this one didn't seem too onerous. So — years after writing off the vegan options that I tried — I decided to give non-dairy a second chance since I have heard good things about coconut cream bases.   
  
The ones I tried then (almond, maybe oat or cashew) are undoubtedly being done better now. But the thing that appealed to me with the coconut is the promise of something richer and denser, as the thin finish on those other vegan milks was unappealing. The other thing I wanted to keep in mind is that the flavor of the coconut tends to come through more than the others.   
  
The upside? I like coconut. So when I picked out five flavors from Jeni's lineup — as they are well-known for their coconut options — I treated them as I would a collection of dairy pints that feature coconut. It's all about how well that flavor balances with what the pint is promising — and these all have another dessert as inspiration (banana pudding, lemon bar, etc.). I was a bit surprised — especially after enjoying the recent Tropical Bloom flavor — that she didn't lean into anything tropical since coconut loves to play with pineapple, mango, etc. Does Jeni not love pina coladas and getting caught in the rain?

Overall verdict? I quite liked the texture, and the flavors — while they wouldn't rank in my Jeni's top tier — were all some shade of good. Below, I am including quick hits, but look for full reviews (and beauty shots) over the next week. I also included two Salt & Straw coconut base flavors I tried earlier in the month. Not as good as Jeni's, but if you're interested search my posts for a full review.

Lastly, I'm curious if you have tried coconut cream ice creams. If so, from which brands? Which flavors did you like or not like? Or is there another dairy-free base you prefer? If so, let me know what I should try next.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**JENI'S**  
**Banana Cream Pudding:** I might have renamed this one to include coconut since it comes through so strongly, but I like it. It's like banana-flavored pudding with a coconut whipped cream and wafer pieces throughout. **(8.2/10)**  
**Peppermint Patty:** I haven't tried the namesake candy in years, but it instantly evoked it with the cool peppermint, which mostly hides the coconut. Chocolate accents work well from the sauce and the cake. **(7.9/10)**  
**Lemon Bar:** This one should be called Lemon Coconut Bar, because the base deserves equal billing. While I could still use more of the curd, it's so puckery and bright it really weaves its web throughout. Shortbread pieces work well. **(7.7/10)**  
**Cold Brew with Coconut Cream:** Here it does get title billing, which is good because there's a ton of it. Too much, though it works really well  with the icy coffee sorbet — a clash of textures I feared, then enjoyed. It's like 1/4 coffee to 3/4 coconut, a ratio I would have flipped. **(7.3/10)**  
**Caramel Pecan Sticky Buns:** This is the most disappointing as I get more coconut then the the caramel, brown sugar and butter notes I hope for with pecan. The nuts are well-distributed, but a lot more caramel is needed. I might reassess if I dig deeper and find large pools, as is sometimes the case. **(6.6/10)**  
**Other Jeni's coconut options:** Note to chocoholics: She  has two flavors you may be more excited for than I: Dark Chocolate Truffle and Texas Sheet Cake.

**SALT & STRAW**  
**Peanut Butter Brittle with Caramel Fudge:** The namesake confection is tasty if you can find it as is the caramel (no real fudge flavor), but they're doled out in miserly fashion, so it's mostly big patches of distinct peanut butter and coconut ice creams, an odd combo that worked well enough. **(6.5/10)**  
**Bananas Foster with Candied Pecans:** All bananas, no Foster. The name got me excited but again the scarcity of the title ingredient is alarming, so you miss the rum-brown butter-spice punch of the sauce in favor of lots of icy banana base (not nearly as creamy and rich as the Jeni's banana). **(5.5/10)**",2,1769502710.0,icecream,0,1.0,False

Hi guys! So what the title says, I’m in my second semester of my freshman year of college and I’ve never kissed or dated a guy. I’ve been feeling really insecure about it recently, as all of my closest friends have now done things with guys. In particular, my closest friend in the world is dating a guy who’s so obsessed with her. I went to an all girls high school, so it made sense in high school that I wasn’t dating anyone, especially as I was, like most teenagers, pretty unhappy for most of it. I had 3 talking stages before college and two of them were too old for me. There was one person I really liked who I randomly approached at the coffee shop he worked at because I thought he was cute, and he ended up being someone I got along with so well. Unfortunately he never felt like mentioning he was 21 when I was 17, so that ended! However, I liked his personality so much and really felt like we worked well.

I’ve always been kind of odd, but supposedly in a fun way. I’m very extroverted and most of my conversations are based around jokes and bits I’ve thought of. My ADHD definitely reflects in my personality, and how quickly I switch around in conversations and hyper fixate on things. Like people are definitely a little alarmed by me, but without trying to sound narcissistic, I’m generally quite liked. People easily remember me as I create a strong impression, but quickly grow to like me. I’m always super excited to meet new people, but it’s often overwhelming for people My closest friend and I have been friends for 16 years now, and I have a lot of very close friends. In college, I decided to act as authentically like myself and was able to find a couple of really close friendships within a week. My friends are so important to me, and I treat them as such. People have often told me that they’re impressed by how easily I’m able to make friends, and remember and care so much about it then. I don’t know if I agree, but people have told me this! I’ve moved around a couple times, and everywhere I’ve moved, my closest friends are people who have never been in relationships. They are some of the most wonderful people I have ever met and they treat me so well. I’ve often not understood the concept of dating someone, just because I couldn’t imagine putting anyone above my closest friends. 

I know I’m not insanely gorgeous, but I definitely think I’m pretty. I’m in a competitive program and as told by many people, I have a very large personality. I went to high school abroad, so I often thought one reason for my lack of romantic attention was due to being perceived as the odd foreigner and the fact it was a racist area. But I guess not! My friends and I would go to music gigs in high school, and no one would ever try to talk to me. In college, I’m in a very male dominated field and no one has made any attempt to see me. I was kind of talking to this one guy, but he didn’t seem to get any of my jokes or things I said, which really made me question what he liked about me. I know I’m not the most approachable at parties but no one has ever made any attempt to hit on me. Also, even though I’m usually so confident talking to someone, I find the process of approaching someone with the sole intention of making out terrifying. Like the issue with being around just so many men all the time is I never make an attempt to hit on them, as I don’t want to be treated differently. As a result, I have quite a lot of male friends in college. But it’s in the way that I always talk to everyone around me, and they all happen to be men. I very much act like I’m only looking for a colleague or friend at the start, and then I later become more normal.

Sorry if this is kind of an incoherent ramble, but I’ve just been feeling really shitty about myself. I’ve been told that this is likely due to my standards being high, as I find myself expecting a lot from any man I like. In the way that the person I liked the most was super funny, very talkative, was clear about his interest, and someone I really enjoyed being around from legitimately the first two minutes of speaking to him. Like I knew the first time speaking to him that this was someone I could see myself really getting to know and liking. I just rarely feel that for a lot of people. I just don’t get what I’m doing so wrong to make the countless number of men I see a day dislike me this much.",3,1769502267.0,relationships,4,1.0,False

1qo839w,https://i.redd.it/1bwypwgypufg1.jpeg,Need help tuning Arc Ultra + 2x Sub 4 in a two-story living room,"Hey everyone,

Looking for some advice on dialing in my setup because this room has been tricky.

I’m running a Sonos Arc Ultra with two Sub 4s in my living room. The layout is open to the dining/kitchen area, and it’s a two-story apartment so the living room is double-height with very high ceilings (roughly 18–20 ft). I attached the floor plan and marked where the TV/Arc and both subs are placed (they’re currently left and right of the TV). The Arc is wall-mounted above a wooden credenza, and the room has hardwood floors with a glass coffee table in front of the couch.

My issue is dialogue consistency. At lower volumes, dialogue becomes hard to understand, but when I turn it up to compensate the whole mix gets very loud and the bass becomes overwhelming, especially on movies with heavy sound design. I’ve already done Trueplay (iPhone 17 Pro), and it helped a bit, but I still feel like I’m fighting the room.

If anyone has tips for how you’d approach Trueplay in a big open-plan, double-height space like this, and what settings you’d start with in the Sonos app (EQ, Speech Enhancement level, Height Audio, sub level, etc.), I’d really appreciate it. I’m also open to placement suggestions if you think having both subs at the TV wall isn’t ideal in a layout like mine.

Thanks in advance.",2,1769502007.0,sonos,1,1.0,False
