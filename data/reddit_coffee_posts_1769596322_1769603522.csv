1qpa0ua,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismCertified/comments/1qpa0ua/seeking_where_is_purpose_of_life/,seeking where is purpose of life ?,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

1qp9yaw,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheOdetteApp/comments/1qp9yaw/when_selfcare_gets_too_loud/,When Self-Care Gets Too Loud,"https://preview.redd.it/7vpnbcng23gg1.jpg?width=1400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d6af35b5484a27398adc8cf176e09513d5452f04

At some point, self-care stopped being caring. It became loud.  
  
Open any app and someone is telling you what you should be doing:

Wake up earlier.  
Drink more water.  
Stop drinking coffee.  
Add magnesium.  
Lift heavy.  
Stretch daily.  
Oil pull.  
Double cleanse.  
Absolutely do not skip sunscreen.  
Also, don’t forget your neck and hands!  
  
It’s not that any of this advice is bad. It’s that all of it is yelling at you at the same time.  
  
**The modern woman is drowning in instructions**  
  
Every corner of the internet has an opinion about how to live your life better: Wellness. Productivity. Beauty. Health. Mental health. Hormones. Longevity.  
  
Each voice is confident.  
Each voice is urgent.  
Each voice is convinced this is the missing piece.  
  
*So you listen. You save the post. You bookmark the video. You screenshot the routine. You buy the product. And slowly, quietly, something shifts.*  
  
Not inspiration. Pressure.  
  
**When good advice becomes noise**  
  
Advice is supposed to help you move forward. But when there’s too much of it, you stop moving at all.  
  
You don’t know where to start.  
You don’t know what matters today.  
You don’t know which rules apply to you.  
  
So instead of feeling supported, you feel managed.  
  
Your body becomes a project.  
Your routines become obligations.  
Your mirror becomes a checklist you’re already failing.  
  
No one tells you this part.  
  
**The invisible weight of “should”**  
  
Every “should” adds weight.  
  
You should be doing more.  
You should be consistent.  
You should want this badly enough to follow through.  
  
*When you don’t, the conclusion is never “this system is flawed.”*  
*It’s always, “what’s wrong with me?”*  
  
So you try again.  
And again.  
And again.  
  
Different advice. Same outcome.  
  
**This is not a discipline problem**  
  
*Women are not failing because they lack willpower. They are failing because they are being pulled in too many directions by too many voices.*  
  
Routines are built as if life is quiet.  
As if energy is unlimited.  
As if interruptions don’t exist.  
  
As if there is one right way to do things, and everyone else has already figured it out.  
  
That version of life is fictional.  
  
**The moment advice turns into avoidance**  
  
Eventually, the noise becomes so loud that you shut it all out.  
  
You stop watching.  
You stop experimenting.  
You stop trying.  
  
*Not because you don’t care. But because caring has become overwhelming.*  
  
Self-care becomes something you’ll “get back to” when life calms down. Spoiler: it never does.  
  
**What women actually need**  
  
Women do not need more tips.  
They do not need louder voices.  
They do not need another expert shouting from the sidelines.  
  
They need:  
  
Fewer decisions at once  
Clear sequences instead of endless options  
Permission to return without starting over  
A way forward that doesn’t punish inconsistency  
They need space to breathe.  
  
They need one calm voice saying:  
“This is enough for today.”  
  
*Beauty and care should feel like guidance, not pressure*  
  
Ritual is quiet.  
Ritual is grounding.  
Ritual meets you where you are — not where you should be.  
  
If you’ve ever felt overwhelmed by advice that was meant to help…  
If you’ve ever felt exhausted before a routine even began…  
If you’ve ever wondered why self-care feels harder than it should…  
  
You are not broken.  
  
You’re just tired of being yelled at.",1,1769603087.0,TheOdetteApp,0,1.0,False

I’m 26 and I spend most of my time looking at the world through a lens or a screen. I’m a photographer and graphic designer, which basically means I’m obsessed with aesthetics, lighting, and storytelling.
But enough about work I’m here because I miss those genuine, ""talk about everything and nothing"" kind of connections. I’m a big fan of deep conversations, obscure art, and finding beauty in the most random places.
A bit more about me:
 I can spend hours arguing about why a specific shade of blue is better than another.
 I love capturing moments that feel like they belong in a movie.
 I probably have a playlist for every possible mood.
 Coffee is my fuel, but a good conversation is what actually keeps me going.
What I’m looking for:
I don’t care where you’re from or what you do, as long as you’re down for some real talk. Tell me about your passion, your favorite travel spot, or even a weird hobby you have.
Slide into my DMs with your favorite photo you’ve ever taken (even if it’s just a blurry cat pic lol) or tell me a song that’s been on repeat for you lately.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

I’ll be moving to Aalborg this summer for a an internship, and I wanted to ask two things:

\- how to best meet people / make friends, and 

\- where to look for short-term accommodation.

A bit about me: I’m a university student (20), international, and I’ll be working full-time during the week. Outside of work I’m pretty flexible, I like sports, grabbing coffee or beers, exploring the city, and I’m always down to try new activities. I don’t know anyone in Aalborg yet, so I’d love to hear what’s worked for others (clubs, sports, events, bars, Facebook groups, etc.).

On the housing side, I’m looking for a room or small studio for the summer only. I’m fine with shared housing. I have seen websites but some people appear to be complaining about scams on them. I also contacted the uni there, not sure I will be eligible tho.

Are there any websites, Facebook groups, housing associations, or neighborhoods you’d recommend for short stays? Anything to avoid or be careful about?

Thank you very much for any tips. If anyone else is around over the summer and wants to hang out, feel free to comment or DM :)

I’ve been sober since New years and feel amazing, longest streak by far and this one feels different.

I’ve been to:

\- beer league hockey numerous times and said no

\- sunday night football with the boys and just had a coffee

\- work dinners with an espresso

\- trucker bar with buddies just had wings and a pop

\- been to my parents house which was always a trigger they have booze everywhere

\- been to the office several times which was a trigger, day to myself

I have more hurdles I know this, but the revelation of realizing I can socialize without alcohol has been massive this time around. Feels sustainable. Of all the sneaking around in the past I always feared the socializing without it. I knewI hada problem but I loved out drinking everyone, able to “be myself” when social drinking is acceptable, I thought it was impossible.

My friend and I recently started a small community project called The Unplanned for people in Chandigarh–Panchkula–Mohali who want to meet new people and spend weekends doing simple, fun activities together.

The idea is very casual — icebreaker sessions, conversations, small games, coffee meetups, indoor activities when the weather is bad, and outdoor ones when it’s nice. 

We’ve already begun and are planning our first “Unplanned” session soon.

I wanted to ask here:
What kind of activities would you personally enjoy in something like this?
And what would make you feel comfortable joining a group of strangers?

1qp9m73,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qp9m73,"Finally copped the NY Zip-up I've been eyeing. 🗽 Plus some other pickups (Carhartt, CH, ERD). Which one would you rock?","1. Godspeed ""Doberman"" Hoodie

Heavy 2000s metal/streetwear energy. The graphic is massive and the ""Godspeed"" font is classic.It's a statement piece, but definitely niche. If the print quality holds up after a wash, it’s a win. A bit loud for daily wear, but great for a specific fit.

Score: 7/10

2. Alo Yoga Black Hoodie

Ultra-minimalist ""clean girl/guy"" aesthetic.It’s basically just a high-end blank. The material feels soft, but honestly, you're paying for the tiny ""alo"" logo. Good for the gym or a coffee run, but nothing groundbreaking.

Score: 6.5/10

3. Stüssy ""Built Tough"" Hoodie

Classic West Coast streetwear.You can't really go wrong with Stüssy. The back graphic is iconic, though these ""paragraph"" prints are starting to feel a bit played out in some circles. Still a solid, reliable piece for the rotation.

Score: 7.5/10

4. NY Zip-Up Hoodie (The Grail of the haul) ⭐

Peak ""Old School New York"" meets modern silhouette.This is easily my favorite piece. The navy is deep, the white NY logo pop is perfect, and the crop/oversized cut looks way better in person than the others. It’s got that effortless ""I just threw this on"" look that actually takes effort to pull off. Absolute banger.

Score: 9.5/10

5. Carhartt WIP Heart Hoodie

Workwear but make it ""soft.""The grey heather is a nice break from all the dark colors. The heart logo is a cool twist on the standard patch. It feels sturdy, like it’ll actually last a decade.

Score: 8/10

6. Enfants Riches Déprimés (ERD) Green Hoodie

Punk-luxury / ""I'm rich and bored.""That neon green is aggressive. You really have to have the confidence to pull this off without looking like a highlighter. The ""enfants"" box logo is clean, but the color makes it hard to style regularly.

Score: 6/10

7. Needles Track Jacket (Dusty Pink/Purple)

Sophisticated Japanese vintage sportswear.The colorway is unique—kind of a mauve/taupe with purple stripes. Needles always hits, but it can look like a pajamas top if you don't style it with the right trousers.

Score: 8/10

8. Vetements All-Over Logo Knit

Total logomania chaos.This is a ""love it or hate it"" piece. It’s objectively ""too much,"" but that’s the whole point of Vetements. It’s heavy and feels premium, but you'll definitely get looks (not all of them good).

Score: 5.5/10 (Subjective, but it's a lot to handle)

9. Chrome Hearts Belt

High-end Rockstar aesthetic.This is a solid pick if you want to elevate a basic denim fit. The silver-tone hardware is sleek, and the logo isn't as overbearing as a massive ""H"" or ""GG"" buckle, which keeps it a bit more tasteful. It’s a versatile piece that bridges the gap between the loud graphics and the cleaner hoodies in your haul.

Score: 8/10

10. Chrome Hearts Orange Cross Camo Hat

Early 2000s trucker style meets luxury streetwear.This is a bold choice. The orange cross patches against the camo are high-contrast and definitely demand attention. While it's a ""grail"" item for many, camo can be tricky to style without looking like you're heading to the woods unless the rest of your fit is very intentional. It pairs perfectly with the Godspeed hoodie if you're going for that aggressive, ""loud"" look.

1qp9lv9,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1qp9lv9/interest_without_intent_he_broke_up_with_me_but_i/,Interest without intent. He broke up with me but I broke the cycle.,"This is long so, bare with me! My BF (25) and I (F25) ended our relationship, well, he ended it and I respected it on Monday, the 5th. I packed up and moved all of my belongings out of the house within 48 hours post BU. He had broken up with me over text, stating he couldn’t do it in person but that he cannot be in a relationship any longer, that he is done. 

I want to preface this with, this past year for us - him specifically was rough. He left his long term job, was unemployed several times going from job to job, unhappy and lost. He attempted to join the police academy 2 times and kept getting declined. He lost his best friend unexpectedly. He was emotional rollercoaster this year with all the changes and rightfully so! Finally, October he was on a more steady path. He found a killer job, got accepted into the police academy after his 3rd attempt. During this time, I supported him. I offered to take on all the bills in the house to support and ease his stress of being on a timeline for finding a job, he continued to decline. I encouraged him the 2nd and 3rd time to reapply to the police academy and had been there as resource to step up and take the reins financially, to get him steady. 

Tuesday the 6th, I came back to the house to get the remainder of my clothing. He was not home which I anticipated and preferred for my own sake. Being emotional, I had written a 5 page letter early that day - thanking him for the years or memories, for taking care of me and letting him know I wish him the best. Before leaving, I cleaned the house, lit a candle and left my letter on the coffee table alongside my house keys.

Wednesday, the 7th, there was no communication. I had settled into my Airbnb and was not nearly as stunned or upset and began to reflect on what ultimately pushed him to BU. Lack of intimacy— emotionally and physically, we had essentially become complacent with one another.

Thursday, the 8th, he called me around 1:30pm. We had a pre-booked vacation he had gifted me for Christmas the month prior. He had called to ask if I was still willing to go, and if not, he would simply refund it. I told him I was unsure and he told me to think about it, just to get back to him by Monday morning. Through out this call, he was asking me where I was staying, what are my plans, and made comments that it seemed I had premeditated plans to move out considering I did it so quickly and without fighting. He stated, he had replugged the cameras back in our house and watched me move out. That he was fearful I was going to destroy the house out of anger with him (this is not a character trait of mine but it is of him) Which was hurtful. I felt as though, it was a jab to my character, however, now, I know it was a projection of his feelings. And I broke his expectations by leaving the house clean, without violence and overall amicably. 

Friday, the 9th, I called him regarding the trip. I felt conflicted and confused, “why would he still want to go on a trip after breaking up?” Did he want me back? Was he being manipulative? Or offering the trip to ease his guilty conscience? So, I asked his expectations of the trip. He stated, he only wanted me to go because he knows how much the trip meant to me, and it was my gift I deserved, that he does NOT want to get back together. That there was “dealbreakers” in the relationship he allowed for an extended period of time and that he did not communicate this to me openly. That he had suppressed his frustrations and snapped on the 5th. That it was his fault for dragging the relationship on for 2.5 years. It boiled down to I did not and I quote, make him feel masculine enough. I told him I will respect the decision and I had asked why not just transfer the tickets to me? Why does he need to go? He stated his name is on the hotel room and he has to be present to check in. I informed him I still felt unsure and would let him know by the end of the weekend. 

Saturday, the 10th - no communication. 

Sunday, the 11th, I called around 11am asking if I could come into the house to gather the remainder of my items. He allowed me to do so. He called me exactly 1 minute after I exited the house (assuming he was watching the cameras) asking if I was “okay?” And if I had made a decision about our trip. I informed him I would be willing to go with boundaries. He ended the call with asking if I needed help moving my items and that if I needed help to call him. I politely declined. He called me 3 more times throughout the evening, asking if I wanted him to box up our Christmas tree and that he could bring it to my Airbnb. I requested he box it up and I will pick it up on a day he isn’t home, that I do not want him knowing my address to my Airbnb. He called another time stating I had taken half of the photos out of our photo book and that he wanted them back. They were his. So, I responded that it is not worth the argument and I would give them back during the trip. 

Monday, the 12th - he called me around 12pm. I didn’t answer as I was on a run. I called back at 3pm. He answered immediately. Stating he had a question about the Christmas tree but that he was busy in that moment and would call me the following day. 

Tuesday, the 13th - no call was received about the Christmas tree. 

Wednesday, the 14th, he called me at 10am and again at 2pm. I declined the calls - I was working. I called him back at 4pm, he did not answer. He called me back at 11pm, we talked for about 45 minutes. He started the call with, inquiring if I still want to go on our trip. He then later brought up the photos and wanting them back. I did call out his behavior, and inquired why he is continuing to call me asking the same questions seeking for answers he has already been provided and that him calling repeatedly made me feel as though he is doing it either out of guilt or to soothe his own feelings by hearing my voice. One thing led to another and he said something that cut deep, that out of all the women he’s been with I am the only one who made him feel masculine. I asked him to no longer call me. I asked that he send me the flight information and no further contact was needed. He ended the call with “well I’ll call you a couple times next about the trip if that’s ok” I stated it wasn’t necessary. 

We did not talk until the 22nd. He called me at 7:30am. I answered. He asked me about the trip, again. I said I still wanted to go. He ended the call stating he would call me later. He called again around 3ish, stating he did not know how to send me the flight information. He then called again at 9pm, inquiring if I needed space in his carry on and to see if I had checked into the flight. 

Friday, the 23rd he called asking what time I was getting to the airport. I informed him after I ran some errands but I would there on time to board. 

Saturday, the 24th we did not talk until after our flight, in the uber to the hotel. I broke the tension initially. And he continued the conversation with questions about me resigning from my job, if I am moving, is my family upset with him and so forth. 

The trip was good. We got along great. Some jabs here and there - to be expected. Most notably, he pointed out an elderly couple and stated “that was supposed to be us” However, he kept asking over and over throughout the trip if I was really moving (we live in PA and I’m moving home to CA) and if I’m looking for an appt in PA or not. He reinforced each time, that I am moving. I returned the photos of us Monday morning. He looked through them, smiled then left the room crying. 

Fast forward, Monday the 26th, after our day out, he had to check into another hotel. Finding the room was a bit confusing and but I understood how to get there. So, him being unsure, he followed me. Half way point to the room his mood switched. He said he felt I was walking aimlessly and that he was going back to the FD to ask for help. I kept walking to the room. He called me, and said “where the f\*\*\* are you?” he screamed at him when I said I was at the room. That he didn’t know how to get there and that I was a “fu\*\*ing dumba\*\*” for not just asking the FD. I hung up and said he is not going to speak to me that way. 

Eventually he found the room, I was in the bathroom, crying. I came out and he was sitting on the bed, silently. He got into the shower and I got dressed to go have dinner alone. I ate then went to the bar for a glass of wine. He was at the bar as well but I kept my distance. We did not talk for the remainder of the night. He did, however, come back to the hotel room around 12am very intoxicated. Stumbling, etc and he passed out. 

Following morning, Tuesday, was our checkout day. I had woken up early, and had gone down for a cup of coffee. He was passed out still. I had come back up and he had woken up, he was getting dressed, and went to the gym. When he returned from the gym he asked if I was crying because of what he had said. I told him yes, that he was insanely rude and disrespectful. He apologized. He said it upset him to hear me crying in the bathroom. I thanked him but did not accept. 

Things go into a heated argument because I was clearly still upset and hurt and he continued to push and ask what I was upset about. So, I let him have it. I explained that his words were hurtful, the BU was sudden and shocking, and that I’ve come to terms that just as much as he may have wanted this BU, I realized I wanted it too. 

I went down to the lobby. We shared an uber to the airport. In the car he kept asking the same questions, when are you moving out of your Airbnb, when are you moving to CA, do you have a lot of items to move, what are your plans. I answered them truthfully.

In the TSA line he had asked if I could send him photos of my road trip back home. I told him no. That after this trip we longer have ties to one another. He asked if we could be friends and I declined the offer. He said he wanted to remain cordial and that he still cares about me. I stated that we do not need to be in contact in order to be cordial or for him to care about me.

After TSA, I went and sat alone, and he kept going back-and-forth of coming to talk to me and then walking away. Upon us boarding the plane, he texted me to let him know if there was any issues with me boarding, and I did not respond.

He was sat at the front of the plane, and I was sat at the back of the plane. When it was time to de-board, I didn’t have any expectations of him to wait for me, but upon deboarding, he was waiting outside of the gate. He asked if we could share an Uber and that he would give me a ride home from the parking lot.

I agreed. In the Uber on the way to the parking lot he asked me again if I was actually moving to California and ask the dates again. When we got to his car, he started the conversation by thanking me for the letter. I left him and said that it had made him cry and that he cannot finish reading it. He then asked again if we could be friends.

I told him that I felt confused because from this point forward why do we need to be friends? He stated that he cares about me and still loves me. I told him that we are not going to be friends because he wants emotional accessibility without the responsibility of it. He did not understand what I meant — I explained that he is wanting me to leave the door open for him. He went back to the letter stating that I had mentioned in a portion of it that if it was not our time now, maybe sometime in the future after we’ve spent time apart and have healed.

I explained that due to his behavior and disrespect words, I’ve had to shift my feelings towards him. And that moment was my final straw. He kept repeating that he cares about me and wants to make sure I am ok. I responded with ultimately telling him that just as I respected his decision of no longer wanting to be together and having to love him from a distance that I need him to care about me from a distance because I need to move forward with my life.

He continued to ask if I was truly moving. He continued to ask and reconfirm if I was sure, I no longer wanted to speak with him. He made lighthearted jokes about coming to visit me at my Airbnb, made a joke about wanting to come up inside my Airbnb because he’s nosy. 

He asked me one last time if I was sure I did not want to be friends, and I left the conversation with stating I do not want you to contact me unless you are willing and wanting to reestablish our relationship which will require accountability and action from both parties. 

I did not linger in the car. I got out, got my luggage, walked up to my door I turned around. He was waiting outside with the window down, staring at me and did not say anything. I thanked him for the ride home and said goodbye and walked inside. 

Upon unpacking my bags, I noticed that he had taken my gift bag and had placed the photos I gave him back into my backpack. I had purchased novelty T-shirts, and magnets. I feel this is a ploy to be manipulative for me to reach out to him. I will not be reaching out, and I will not answer if he reaches out at this point the principal matters more than the materials. 

I have removed all photos in my phone of him, I deleted his contact, and removed all access of me on social medias by unfollowing. 

I wrote this, not necessarily looking for feedback or advice, but just to document my experience in this process. Because, I felt relieved having the conversation with him yesterday during my drop off. I felt that I placed healthy boundaries with clear intent of my expectations of him should he reach back out. It felt as if there was a power shift — that he no longer had influence over my emotions or my decisions. 

I don’t know how he feels nor am I going to suspect how he feels however, I am certain that he will likely reach out to me to test the boundaries prior to me moving as now there’s a timeline. 

I’ve learned in this process that he is showing tendencies of avoidance and is illustrating interest without intent. I do not believe he’s doing this consciously. I believe he has internal turmoil that he cannot sit with and dissect, which is in turn projecting as mixed signals. i’ve come to terms with his avoidance, sudden outburst and repetitive questions are deeply rooted in his own insecurities, and that maybe all along it wasn’t me who made him feel not masculine.

I finally feel I’ve come to terms with our breakup and got the closure I needed to move forward on my own terms. I wish him the best, happiness and healing. I pray he is able to find comfortability in uncomfortability. And that if it is meant to be, he will step up and change. Not for me, or for another partner but for himself. 

Apart me will always be curious on his thoughts of our last conversation and if it will truly hit home as an avoidant. But I’m not willing to sacrifice my own self protection to find out!

I opened my own bank account as a kid with Capitec around 2013 when it cost R5 monthly fee (now R7.50 - using a pay as you use model)

When Tyme bank just launched they were offering up to 11% interest on GoalSave accounts (Savings account) while still being able to bank for free. I of course opened an account with them at a PnP kiosk in 2019 as the interest was better than I was getting at Capitec (4%-7%).This has been lowered to about 7%(?) over the years. A condition that comes with earning the max interest is that your salary must be paid into your Tyme account. I still have the free account today, but doesn't get used.

I had a friend who banked with Absa, and he could do this \*magical\* thing where he could load his bank card and pay with his phone all the way back in 2021 (ApplePay). I HAD to be able to do this too, so I opened a student Absa account (free).

After hours of research on how I can build more credit (paradox of needing a credit score to get a credit card but needing a credit card to build a credit score) I discovered that Absa has a student credit card. All you need is signed letter indicating proof of allowance from parents/guardian. Absa will offer you a credit limit of R200 without additional monthly banking fees.

I bought a car in January 2023 that was financed through Wesbank who gave me the best interest rate at 13.01% considering my credit record was less than 2 years old.

I wanted to continue building my credit, but even though I had a clothing account and Absa Student Credit Card, Capitec didn't want to give me a credit card.

Staying with Absa after finishing as a student wasn't really an option because the app was frustrating to use and always had seemingly horrible loading times.

I explored other options and then opened an FNB account as they were happy to give a credit card at about 2x my gross salary at the time. (22.50% interest after 59 interest free days or something).

With my car loan already being through Wesbank, I was easily bumped up the ebucks levels. With some work of clicking around in the app I could get to Level 5 and earn about R800 back in ebucks.

In 2023/2024 ebucks was prime. Free weekly Starbucks coffee. Monthly Kauai smoothie (including protein and superfood smoothies) and free access to The Entertainer (offering a good handful of 2 for 1 deals on main menu items) all while still being able to pay the R240 (now R250) account fees using ebucks, meaning I could bank for free.

FNB have changed the ability to earn points (and the number of points required) to get to the max level probably about 4 times in the last 3 years - each time making it slightly more difficult than the last to get to Level 5. It is basically impossible these days unless you have a home loan, vehicle financing and some other additional hogwash products.

The Starbucks reward changed where they now offer R50 off on a R75 spend… But there are no drinks on the menu for R75. So you have to get a food item (of at least R90 meaning you'll have to pay R40 yourself), or add stupid syrups and extra shots just to get to R75 for a drink you didn't \*actually\* want.

In a world of R14 Expresso coffee, R29 Bootleggers before 8am and R20 Mugg & Bean coffee subscriptions, this really doesn't make girl math sense…

I was always curious as to when I would be “good enough” for Capitec to give me a credit card, so I checked back every couple of months. I was also slightly offended that I already had a good credit score with multiple credit products and even an “adulting” credit card with FNB - but Capitec didn't budge.

Fast forward 3 years later to 2026,

I sold the car I got earlier in the post and purchased a more reliable one. Oddly enough it was the wiser financial decision - but the details are not the point of this post.

The finance clerk doing my vehicle financing application tells me Wesbank will offer a loan at 12.50% and ONLY IF I move my debit order to my salary account (which is my FNB. I use Capitec because I want to keep all my debit orders together). This was unacceptable to me - both the request to move, but also the interest rate (I'd done previous finance applications at other dealerships and was offered 10.50%)

I informed the finance clerk of the previous loan terms I got. MFC came in at the closest, and so the clerk could negotiate them down to match the previous offer of 10.50% (while being able to choose Capitec as the debit order bank despite my salary being paid into FNB).

Since opening my FNB account, I have become a qualified professional, so my salary has somewhat doubled. I have been curious to see how much credit they would afford me now. To my surprise, FNB didn't want to increase my limits at all. I found this very strange.

With my vehicle being financed though MFC, I'll probably be stuck on ebucks level 1. I was more than 1500 points away from level 3 the last time I checked. So ebucks doesn't really serve me as well as it used to.

As I routinely have, I checked back in to see how Capitec was doing, and believe it or not, they were willing to give me a credit card.

Capitec offered me a credit card at more than 2x my gross salary (10.50% interest after 55 interest free days). This blows FNB out of the water. With some basic math, this is about 4x my credit limit at FNB while having an interest rate that is competitive with mortgages.

I am now trying to decide when I will downgrade my FNB account to the free option and use Capitec as my main account.

Possibly, salary and EFT’s made from FNB. Debit orders from Capitec Savings account (that is their version of a transactional account) and daily purchases using Capitec credit card (paid off monthly via EFT from FNB).

Final thoughts: all banks have a free (or almost free) banking option. Therefore the cost of switching should (at most) cost about 1 full (and dedicated) week of admin. I would really think that banks (mostly referring to FNB here) would be smarter in making their product more “sticky” to keep the consumer coming back. I'll probably go back to them some day, but until then… Cheers

I hope my journey will, in some weird or wonderful way, help people, even if it is just to inform.",3,1769601832.0,capetown,4,0.71,False
1qp9icj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1qp9icj/prayer_requestventrantadvice/,Prayer Request/VentRant/Advice,"Hey guys. First, I want to say I apologize in advance for the yap or trauma dump. I really don’t want to make this long, but that’s usually the case with me.

I used to be in the occult/New Age. Since I was maybe 12. Life was hard, and I pretty much accepted that I was suicidal, that life sucked, and that I was doomed from the start. The media and other influences successfully manipulated me into believing that I could change my reality just by changing my thoughts and performing rituals and all that. It became a whole hamster wheel and journey within itself.

Seven years ago, I started to feel really off-put by it all and had this odd desire to go to church, despite not really being Christian in any sense in the past. I ignored this call, though, because there was always just the tiniest bit of confirmation bias that New Age/witchcraft/LOA could still give me the easy life I wanted, which kept pulling me back into those habits that only got me no where, and wasted my time.

Recently, in September of 2025, I had my official coming-to-Christ moment, kind of out of nowhere, after abandoning the occult life for two years prior and slowly researching the evil and manipulation behind it. During my time in New Age, with all the witchcraft and manifestations and journaling ""shadow work"" 30 day meditation and everything they promise would rapid fire results ,life was STILL hard, and so I accepted that having faith in God and converting to Christianity wasn’t going to magically remodel my life into something perfect overnight, but that it was going to save my soul and that's all that matters in the end.

I was radically saved by Christ, and every spiritual attack, sleep paralysis episode, and spiritual struggle miraculously stopped at that time. Every spiritual agreement I made in ignorance was canceled the very second I have my life to Christ. That only strengthened my faith in God. But recently, times have been trying again. I try to be in the Word every night and in the mornings, but I can’t seem to cope with the obvious fact that my life still feels like a failure.

Let me paint a picture for you. I never went to public school. As far back as I can remember, I was in online school, raised by the internet. No father, single mom, two older siblings. One sibling could never hold a job due to mental health struggles, and my other older sibling never got a job because, just like me, my mom forced us to be extremely sheltered to “protect” us. Now my sister, even at 25, is struggling to grow up and not rely on our mom.

She (my older sister) had several chances to actually do something when I was a young child, but the conditioning made her not feel confident, if that makes sense. I was literally a 10-year-old begging my mom to let me get a job to help out because we constantly watched her struggle financially and cry over bills.

Now I’m 21, and we all still live together. I’ve tried to get a job since high school with absolutely no luck, not even fast food places. Most places you ask say they’re not hiring, even though you clearly see multiple booths with only one person working. Others say “apply online,” and when you do, you either can’t find your location on their careers page because the area is too rural or ghetto, or you do find it by the grace of God and never hear back. I’ve gone to a plaza full of establishments and applied to every single one in a single day, only to never be contacted or be turned down by all of them. The most recent jobs I tried was a local diner which rejected me a day later, and a shoe store, same outcome of rejection.

At that point, my last option felt like accepting being poor and mediocre, entering a church like God asked me to 7 years ago, and radically giving my entire being to Christ by devoting my life to humanitarian services and helping feed the poor. I went to church the last Sunday before the storm, and an older man who seemed nice invited me in and asked me to join when he saw me walking around the area.

I had my eye on this church the exact seven years ago that God was pushing me to join a church and worship Him, I don't have confidence  so being kindly invited in this felt like God nudging me and saying, “Yes, this is the path I wanted you on. Church and human services.” the guy who invited me in was nice and showed me around the church offered me coffee etc and said if I ever need anyone to talk to or want to get to know the church he could give me his phone number, now we obviously just met and just because I have no life experience doesn't mean I blindly trust people so I gave the guy a spoof/automated number that expired in 48 hours so I could get a new one. I’ve never really talked to another human who wasn’t online due to my sheltered upbringing, so I don’t normally trust people, hence the fake number.

But I digress. The guy was a complete creep the whole time I kind of regretted giving even the fake number before he even texted it during the service itself He immediately started saying he wasn’t like other guys and that if I needed help, I should know he wasn’t a pervert, etc. Which, if you’re not a pervert, you don’t need to say that constantly. You just behave accordingly, not make it a public service announcement. He kept asking where I lived and if it was close or far from the church, he kept asking details about my personal life which I didn't respond to at all. +++ More I won't mention 

He texted me maybe an hour or two after the service, when the bus dropped him off at home, and the messages were extremely creepy, talking about wanting physical contact with me even though he had only known me for literally 30 minutes. I feel like the devil is working through this man to keep me out of church, but I also know that church is somewhere I’m called to go.

I didn’t even want to return this Sunday literally because I don't want to see this guy who by the way I learned was in his late late 40's. I was contemplating if I should go or not but the snowstorm closed everything and decided for me. Now I’m back at home with my mom and siblings again, and things are harder than ever. The cold caused issues that got our water turned off, and we only have electricity for heating. Basically everything in our house is busted because of how old it is, and maintenance and upkeep have been poor because we can’t afford to keep up with payments.

I just feel so useless. On top of that, my mom’s health is declining, and she’s the only one everyone relies on financially. I don’t know what to do. I’ve told her that I can’t start most things without a bank account, but I’d never be able to maintain a bank account without recurring income to keep it open. With no job, that feels impossible. She always tells me she can’t worry about us kids anymore because we’re all grown and should figure it out.

But with my sheltered upbringing, I literally have no idea how anything works. Research just confuses me more. I know I’d probably understand if I had everything in place and figured it out as I went, but I still don’t have a job to support that startup phase.

I literally have nothing. Nada. Zero. Not even friends. I have nothing except my faith that God is faithful. While I know that’s true, I’m still not expecting some magical miracle overnight. Not even the devil, when I was in New Age, could give me the life I was tantalized by and promised. It feels like I was predestined to fail and be nothing.

I’m sorry if this sounds dramatic. I guess I just really need advice, or maybe someone out on this planet who relates to me. Even the idea of love doesn’t feel possible. If I go out for a simple walk to clear my mind, I just get catcalled. No one wants to talk, it’s all lustful. So I can’t even rely on the idea of potential marriage and children, which I want not just for stability that a man brings but because I genuinely value that kind of life. I’d love to stay home and cook bread on a loop for a husband and kids. That sounds like a dream to me.

The modern state of the world feels like garbage for everyone I know. The bar is so low that most people would rather be dead. The only “jobs” it feels like exist around here are freebasing crack or becoming a stripper, and I would never do either of those things, so I guess I’m dying a poor man.

I’m still not sure about going back to church because of that weird guy, but something about it felt right, the pastor, the group, just not that one man who invited me. Anyway, I digress. Things are hard. Please pray for me, or offer any kind of advice you have. I'm thankful if anyone even responds at all and God bless you all if you read this far and I hope you're all surviving the cold well.",1,1769601780.0,Christianity,1,1.0,False
1qp9i7n,https://i.redd.it/7wbg3dfly2gg1.jpeg,Bialetti Venus 6 & 10 cup tips for further improvement?,"Hello there!

We are a 4 people family household and I'm the only one drinking coffee (my wife hates coffee!).

I like ""strong"" coffee so a normal filter machine doesn't really make me happy (haven't had a decent coffee out of a filter machine in my whole life) and the Nespresso machine produces a ""decent"" coffee. Sure it's miles behind from a good coffee from a good coffee bar but it's, I would say, good enough/satisfactory and servable.

Until \~2 weeks ago I was using a Nespresso capsule machine because I always told myself it's not worth it to upgrade to a pricey automatic or portafilter machine to brew 1 - 2 big cups of coffee per day (I always used 2 capsules for a big cup of coffee).

My wife was annoyed by the price of the capsules as well as the trash it produces (we can't bring it back anywhere near us so it landed in the trash...).

My parents always made coffee with a bialetti mokapot so I decided to pull the trigger and ordered a Venus 6 cup and Venus 10 cup (if I need to make coffee for multiple people) for our Bora induction stove as well as a Kingrinder K2 and some aeropress filters (which I sometimes put in and sometimes not, still experimenting :-)).

Did the initial 3 throwaway brewings with Lavazza preground coffee and used the Lavazza for the time being while waiting on the Kingrinder and until we went for our weekly shopping to get some decent beans.

The first brews I did with the Lavazza were truly absolutely horrible as I was still figuring out hot vs cold water and which heat level of the induction stove I should be using.

After a few tries it got better and as I got my Kingrinder and beans I further experimented and have kinda settled it to a pretty satisfactory result now.

\* Bialetti 6 cup (found that the 10 cup somehow produces way worse results and haven't experimented with it a lot yet as 1 6 cup brewing is enough for a big cup of coffee)

\* Stove heat level: 3 out of 9

\* Grindsize: Between 50-60 Clicks (depends on the bean and if I'm using a aeropress filter or not), but usually 55 clicks

\* Water: Pre-boiled tap water

\* Beans: Kaffee Manufaktur (Azul Germany Bremen) Brazil Medium Roast (cerrado natural) and Espresso Honduras Medium-Dark roast (copan washed)

Takes a bit of time with a pretty slow and steady stream and I take it off and stop the brewing before it starts to sputter/bubble as I found that makes it overly bitter otherwise.

1. Do you have any recommendations for improvement?

2. Any tips on how to dial in/make the 10 cup venus produce a similiar result to.the 6 cup one?

3. I'll try with a few different beans in the near future once I'm done with my 2 bags (from Kaffe Manufaktur as well as 2 local roasters). ",3,1769601768.0,mokapot,5,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

1qp9gu9,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_dr_chrisv/comments/1qp9gu9/south_africas_guide_to_banking_wheres_your/,South Africa’s guide to banking (where's your compromise?),"Tldr: At some point or another, all banking options stuck. Just stay open to change to the one that suits your current needs best.

I opened my own bank account as a kid with Capitec around 2013 when it cost R5 monthly fee (now R7.50 - using a pay as you use model)

When Tyme bank just launched they were offering up to 11% interest on GoalSave accounts (Savings account) while still being able to bank for free. I of course opened an account with them at a PnP kiosk in 2019 as the interest was better than I was getting at Capitec (4%-7%).This has been lowered to about 7%(?) over the years. A condition that comes with earning the max interest is that your salary must be paid into your Tyme account. I still have the free account today, but doesn't get used.

I had a friend who banked with Absa, and he could do this \*magical\* thing where he could load his bank card and pay with his phone all the way back in 2021 (ApplePay). I HAD to be able to do this too, so I opened a student Absa account (free).

After hours of research on how I can build more credit (paradox of needing a credit score to get a credit card but needing a credit card to build a credit score) I discovered that Absa has a student credit card. All you need is signed letter indicating proof of allowance from parents/guardian. Absa will offer you a credit limit of R200 without additional monthly banking fees.

I bought a car in January 2023 that was financed through Wesbank who gave me the best interest rate at 13.01% considering my credit record was less than 2 years old.

I wanted to continue building my credit, but even though I had a clothing account and Absa Student Credit Card, Capitec didn't want to give me a credit card.

Staying with Absa after finishing as a student wasn't really an option because the app was frustrating to use and always had seemingly horrible loading times.

I explored other options and then opened an FNB account as they were happy to give a credit card at about 2x my gross salary at the time. (22.50% interest after 59 interest free days or something).

With my car loan already being through Wesbank, I was easily bumped up the ebucks levels. With some work of clicking around in the app I could get to Level 5 and earn about R800 back in ebucks.

In 2023/2024 ebucks was prime. Free weekly Starbucks coffee. Monthly Kauai smoothie (including protein and superfood smoothies) and free access to The Entertainer (offering a good handful of 2 for 1 deals on main menu items) all while still being able to pay the R240 (now R250) account fees using ebucks, meaning I could bank for free.

FNB have changed the ability to earn points (and the number of points required) to get to the max level probably about 4 times in the last 3 years - each time making it slightly more difficult than the last to get to Level 5. It is basically impossible these days unless you have a home loan, vehicle financing and some other additional hogwash products.

The Starbucks reward changed where they now offer R50 off on a R75 spend… But there are no drinks on the menu for R75. So you have to get a food item (of at least R90 meaning you'll have to pay R40 yourself), or add stupid syrups and extra shots just to get to R75 for a drink you didn't \*actually\* want.

In a world of R14 Expresso coffee, R29 Bootleggers before 8am and R20 Mugg & Bean coffee subscriptions, this really doesn't make girl math sense…

I was always curious as to when I would be “good enough” for Capitec to give me a credit card, so I checked back every couple of months. I was also slightly offended that I already had a good credit score with multiple credit products and even an “adulting” credit card with FNB - but Capitec didn't budge.

Fast forward 3 years later to 2026,

I sold the car I got earlier in the post and purchased a more reliable one. Oddly enough it was the wiser financial decision - but the details are not the point of this post.

The finance clerk doing my vehicle financing application tells me Wesbank will offer a loan at 12.50% and ONLY IF I move my debit order to my salary account (which is my FNB. I use Capitec because I want to keep all my debit orders together). This was unacceptable to me - both the request to move, but also the interest rate (I'd done previous finance applications at other dealerships and was offered 10.50%)

I informed the finance clerk of the previous loan terms I got. MFC came in at the closest, and so the clerk could negotiate them down to match the previous offer of 10.50% (while being able to choose Capitec as the debit order bank despite my salary being paid into FNB).

Since opening my FNB account, I have become a qualified professional, so my salary has somewhat doubled. I have been curious to see how much credit they would afford me now. To my surprise, FNB didn't want to increase my limits at all. I found this very strange.

With my vehicle being financed though MFC, I'll probably be stuck on ebucks level 1. I was more than 1500 points away from level 3 the last time I checked. So ebucks doesn't really serve me as well as it used to.

As I routinely have, I checked back in to see how Capitec was doing, and believe it or not, they were willing to give me a credit card.

Capitec offered me a credit card at more than 2x my gross salary (10.50% interest after 55 interest free days). This blows FNB out of the water. With some basic math, this is about 4x my credit limit at FNB while having an interest rate that is competitive with mortgages.

I am now trying to decide when I will downgrade my FNB account to the free option and use Capitec as my main account.

Possibly, salary and EFT’s made from FNB. Debit orders from Capitec Savings account (that is their version of a transactional account) and daily purchases using Capitec credit card (paid off monthly via EFT from FNB).

Final thoughts: all banks have a free (or almost free) banking option. Therefore the cost of switching should (at most) cost about 1 full (and dedicated) week of admin. I would really think that banks (mostly referring to FNB here) would be smarter in making their product more “sticky” to keep the consumer coming back. I'll probably go back to them some day, but until then… Cheers

I hope my journey will, in some weird or wonderful way, help people, even if it is just to inform.",1,1769601657.0,u_dr_chrisv,0,1.0,False

Heres the background: 
I'm a university student from an immigrant family. I grew up w parents who had money and lost it all and went into debt they only after +10 years just got out off. Ontop of that I was homeless for a while and bc of that I always live w the fear of losing it all. I need to know I have enough to sustain myself in emergency.
I'n fine now because I got lucky and reconnected with my mother who took me in - so she is all the support I have. 
We live in a tiny apartment thats essentially the attic, but its fine because we're both short so we can access most of it - my mom used to sleep on the couch while I had my own room (its a two bedroom so essentially the living room is her room where her clothes are and she sleeps). Nowdays she ""lives"" at her boyfriends place and I live alone, so I have to take care of shopping and the house etc etc. I also mention this because people tend to react super weirdly and say apologetic for me about my living circumstances but I am very comfortable and happy! 

Now, under these circumstances, I am incredibly careful with money. I started working at 16 and saved up EVERYTHING I earned, which lead to roughly 20k in savings. I don't tell people this. 

This problem arrised when I made friends with leople in Uni whi are either very well off due to their parents or the type to spend everything they have on the first day and then struggle through the month. Its super common here that people wanna do stuff that wastes money; instead of bringing coffee from home going to a coffeeshop everyday, going to restaurants, partying, trips to other countries etc. Everytime I nicely said I Don't wanna do these things they want a why, and I kept getting accused of just not liking people - so eventually I said I can't afford it. 
Which is only half true; I have a very tight budget based on my monthly income. J track it all so I have savings, and I don't spend above that. If I didn't watch what I spent I'd not be able to buy food at the end of the month. 

Now, that lead to people kinda assuming I'm poor. I made a friend who is seemingly very well off  He likes to flex his money and show off his expensive rings (like 600€s) etc, and he has decided that he will now offer to buy me anything I want and not take a no for an answer.
Now we're best friends, and I only allowed him to buy me smt once for 20€s, but I don't know how I can keep this up because I feel beyond guilty. He jokingly calls me poor which I'm fine with, but I feel bad bc I'm lying to him by not telling him I actually have money - I just cant spend it. 
He's upset at me right now for not letting him buy me a 15€ spider plush. I send him a picture to show hiw cute it is and he asked how much, I told him I can't take his money and he said he has enough and its payment for being a great friend - but I feel he wouldn't offer if he knew I actually am just very careful with money.

1qp9e3x,https://www.reddit.com/r/autismgirls/comments/1qp9e3x/are_you_looking_for_ultimate_perfection_of_life/,are you looking for ultimate perfection of life,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1qp9bf7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qp9bf7,Odeon's Silver Screen is a bit on the popular side... This is the queue for free coffees after the £2 entry fee.,"Odeon's Silver Cinema is a bit on the popular side... This is the queue for free coffees after the £2 entry fee.

I must've been to one of these before, but while they used to be £3 and without the free drink, the only time I remember was a screening of After The Hunt in its first week, which wasn't a Silver Cinema, but coincided with the usual time for it, and was full of pensioners. Hope they enjoyed that one more than I did.

Since they only have a couple of trailers, the film started quite early, and the big lights had been left on, with the doors open. I did my duty to go and close the doors and switch the lights off, but after a few mins, the film stopped, and the low-lights came on. No-one came in to tell us why, but someone did go out to ask, and confirmed what I guessed, given the long queue... they waited until everyone had got a drink, THEN restarted the film. Someone (presumably staff) put the lights on again in the meantime, but again, they were left on as it began again, so I did my duty again.

Personally, after scanning in, I was gestured towards the queue for the free drink, but my water and Red Thunder will see me through. I don't need a hot drink that'll go cold before I finish it, and then it just gets in the way. Plus, I didn't fancy standing in that queue for it.

The film, yesterday, was Desperate Journey. A WWII film to coincide with Holocaust Memorial Day, and a true story, but unfortunately quite pedestrian in the telling, feeling like it just threw in cameos from Steven Berkoff and Til Schweiger to boost the no-name cast, although while some scenes were set in Vienna, the entire thing was shot in Hungary.

This was at the Trafford Centre, and as I'm curious to check out the seatmaps sometimes, I kept the link for this one and checked it as the credits rolled, and it was jam-packed. Next week's Nuremberg is in a smaller screen (3). I expect it'll go to this one again (5). Maybe in time, even shift to a bigger one like 7 or 14, as these are going to be a weekly event, which is good as it gets everyone out and about. I expect they'll also just pause the last trailer after it ends, until everyone's got a drink.

So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.

1qp95xf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1qp95xf/joining_a_luxury_gym_to_network/,Joining a Luxury Gym to network?,"Honestly, I am not joining the gym hoping to network. 

I was looking for a coworking place instead of going to different coffee shops. I figured I could focus more if I am surrounded by the same people working on something. 

Those places run around $300 month just for a seat. 

Then I discovered this luxury gym that has everything. 

Swimming pool on the roof, gym with nice equipments, fitness class, sauna plus co working place. This one is like $350 a month. When I think about gym+class+coworking space, it is actually pretty good deal. 

The only issue is they require 1 year contract. It's $4550 total for the year.



It is obvious a gym with such price will bring a totally different clientele than $25 bucks a month gym. I do believe just surrounding myself with such people will bring a positive influence. (eg: Hanging out with fit people get you keep motivated) 

As far as networking goes, if I happen to get to know someone, that's fine but I won't try hard to network with people (too much self-pride?) 

At the end of the day, if I can boost my productivity by $350 a month by being there, it is a success.

now its the world itself thats crushing me. everything feels wrong. even basic stuff. buying a coffee buying clothes just existing. it feels like every choice i make supports something awful and i cant unsee it.

how am i supposed to enjoy my life knowing someone was probably exploited to make the things i wear. i try to shop small try to be sustainable but i cant always afford it and every time i walk into a store i feel this heavy guilt sitting in my chest.

i even started making some of my own clothes and still my brain goes who suffered to make this yarn. i feel stuck because no matter what i do it feels like im supporting systems that dont care about people or the planet.

therapy keeps telling me to care less but i dont know how. caring less feels like turning my back on humanity. like choosing comfort over doing the right thing. but caring this much is slowly breaking me.

1qp93bv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bloggers/comments/1qp93bv/i_almost_lost_millions_to_a_single_letter_how/,I Almost Lost Millions to a Single Letter: How GhostGuard Saved Our Company When Traditional Antivirus Stayed Silent,"I have always considered myself vigilant. In my role, attention to detail is not optional—it’s essential. I review contracts, approve transactions, and handle sensitive data daily. I know how to spot phishing emails. I know not to click suspicious links. Or at least, I believed I did.

Last week, our company came dangerously close to a financial disaster. A targeted cyberattack nearly compromised our banking credentials and could have resulted in losses in the millions. What still unsettles me is this: the enterprise antivirus software we’ve relied on for years never raised a single alert. The only thing that stopped the attack was a lightweight browser extension we were testing for free—**GhostGuard by Ghostly Solutions**.

https://preview.redd.it/tkugnz7ru2gg1.png?width=930&format=png&auto=webp&s=f750a79670d2f7a3bd3822715bcaa377cb629380

**The Setup**

The incident began with a phone call. The caller was calm, professional, and well-informed. They referenced a real transaction our company was processing and explained there was an urgent issue that required immediate verification. Nothing felt off. They directed me to a portal to confirm our banking credentials.

I clicked the link.

The website looked flawless. The branding, colors, fonts, and layout were identical to our bank’s official site. I checked the URL bar. At first glance, it appeared correct. Everything aligned with what I expected to see. I prepared to enter my admin login and two-factor authentication code.

**The Red Screen Moment**

Just before I clicked “Login,” GhostGuard intervened.

The page was instantly blocked, replaced by a bold warning:

**“Phishing Detected. Do not enter your data.”**

I froze.

I leaned closer to the screen and inspected the URL again—this time slowly. That’s when I noticed it. The domain name was different by a single letter. One character. A textbook **typosquatting attack**, designed to exploit human pattern recognition and urgency.

I glanced at our corporate antivirus icon in the system tray. Green. “System Secure.” No alerts. No warnings. Nothing.

The phishing site was brand new. It wasn’t on any blacklist yet. Our traditional antivirus, dependent on known threat databases, was completely blind.

**Why We Switched Immediately**

We originally installed GhostGuard as a trial. Frankly, we were skeptical. Why would we need a browser extension when we already had enterprise-grade security software?

After this incident, skepticism turned into urgency.

We conducted a full internal audit and re-scanned our corporate inboxes with [**GhostGuard**](https://ghostguard.ae/download) active. The results were alarming. GhostGuard flagged dozens of malicious links buried in older emails—links that had slipped past our email filters and antivirus software without detection.

**Real-Time Protection vs. Reactive Security**

That’s when the difference became clear.

Traditional antivirus solutions are reactive. They wait for threats to be reported, analyzed, and added to blacklists. GhostGuard operates differently.

* **Real-Time Analysis:** It scans page structure and behavior instantly, directly in the browser.
* **No Blacklists:** It doesn’t matter if a phishing site was created five minutes ago. If it behaves like a scam, it’s blocked.
* **Zero System Load:** There’s no noticeable slowdown. It runs quietly and efficiently.

**Conclusion**

We didn’t hesitate. We purchased an annual GhostGuard subscription for our entire organization the same day. The return on investment is immeasurable. For the cost of a few cups of coffee per user, GhostGuard prevented what could have been a multi-million-dollar loss. If more companies adopted real-time, browser-level protection like this, phishing success rates would collapse. Scammers rely on speed, deception, and outdated defenses. GhostGuard removes all three. Don’t wait for your own red screen moment to realize your current security stack isn’t enough. We almost learned that lesson the hard way.

me M30 and my girlfriend F24 started seeing each other pretty much as she was on the way out of a messy abusive relationship. we hit it off amazing but pretty much after the first 3 weeks of seeing each other she found out she was pregnant.. we talked about it a lot and I know she had wanted this for years and I said I don't want her to do something she's uncomfortable with and I myself have wanted a child for a while, so we decided to just go for it.

I had doubts around a potential crossover with her ex where it was a messy time and she reassured me there's no way because they haven't slept together during such and such window, and also they've been trying for years and he just wasn't capable so she pretty much ruled it out. we had a first scan and the dates seemed to line up so I was happy.

this is where it gets messy. her ex was very abusive and controlling, he assaulted her a few weeks after separating when he was dropping their other child back, and some time after that had put a tracker on her car in an attempt to find out where I lived, and just control her etc. it's been non stop abuse from his side really since they split. she had jim arrested and he was charged for this with a pending court date.

since being arrested she has been very closed off and reserved, non stop crying says she feels guilty about this entire situation, putting me through this putting her son through this, just insane mixed emotions after everything that's happened and being pregnant. 

Weekend comes around and she's very off, doesn't want to talk just completely shuts down. I meet her for a Coffee Monday and she starts saying she might have doubts about who's child it is and feels bad for me bringing this up now, and that she's so mentally shut down right now all she can focus on is just staying alive and being there for her son. she doesn't know how to proceed from this point and needs time to just get her head together and process the Whirlwind of the last month or two.

I'm stuck, I feel like I've just been moved to the side while she deals with her own mental state, but we're barely talking now and I still very much likely have a child on the way with this person (she's 8 weeks along currently) and I just don't even know what to do now. I noticed this morning she took her relationship status off her profile and this is just all becoming weird like I'm being shut out. 

I feel like my only option right now is to give her time to bring her head around as this is all so fresh, but also feel like I'm somehow being frozen out and she's trying to just move on without me and have this baby without me involved.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

1qp91ng,https://www.reddit.com/r/sterilization/comments/1qp91ng/bilateral_salpingectomy_uk/,Bilateral salpingectomy (UK),"Hello! So I noticed people tend to speak about their experience with getting sterilised so I thought I’d do the same :) For medical context, I’m 20 turning 21 in just under 2 months, non-binary transmasculine (AFAB) and childfree. Most of my communication with my GP and the hospital was over the phone, unless stated otherwise.

**Referral:**

I initially went through my GP at the time in Sunderland. The GP has a good reputation for putting referrals through when you ask them, with little to no pushback. I personally would definitely recommend that GP to anyone who was local and asked, they were great when I lived in Sunderland. I believe I initially requested the referral in June 2025, and I had my surgery January 27th of this year. I was offered earlier (October), but due to relocation it was too difficult in terms of travel and other responsibilities I had at the time.

My referral itself was pretty easy. I contacted my GP, explained that I wanted to get permanently sterilised. My initial choice was tubal ligation, because I hadn’t done much research into bilateral salpingectomy. They said something along the lines of that because I was young with no physical health issues and didn’t have any past children, they couldn’t promise anything but they’d set me up to speak to someone who specialised in the referrals essentially - so I was approved for an assessment. I genuinely can’t remember the conversation and/or if they asked me why I wanted to be sterilised, all I know is that I didn’t have any significant issue.

**Pre-assessment:**

The lady who did the assessment was lovely. She asked me why I wanted to get sterilised (I don’t want children), she asked me if I was sure I didn’t want children. I explained that yes, I’ve never wanted children since the moment I understood the concept of having children. I’d also had a previous termination when I ended up accidentally pregnant so I do think a previous termination of the possibility of a child strengthened my case. She asked me if I had tried other contraceptive methods, I explained that I’d tried multiple and none really worked for me in terms of the negatives outweighing the positives. For example, the pill I struggled with because of my severe amnesia, and also the side effects of the pill itself. Essentially the side effects I experienced just weren’t worth it to me. I explained my family and personal history of mental illness, and that it would be both detrimental to me and the child if I brought a pregnancy to term. I also mentioned my dysphoria I experienced knowing that pregnancy was a possibility (even on another form of contraceptive as they’re never 100%). This was when bilateral salpingectomy came up as she asked me what I’d prefer done with my tubes. She gave me the options of either having them tied, burned, clipped or removed altogether. I felt it was in my best interest to have them fully removed, given my dysphoria and also the fact that having tubes removed can have health benefits ie. reducing risk of cancer. I saw no downsides to it, so I said I’d prefer that. I did some quick research just to get an idea of the procedure. She asked me if I was aware of what the procedure was and the risks. I said I was. She asked if I was happy to go ahead with that procedure knowing the risks, and I said yes. She asked if I’d had any surgery before, if I’d been under anaesthesia before, if I was on any medication etc basically just the basic questions to get an idea of my medical history. There was very little to no pushback from her. She emphasised that unlike tying tubes etc bilateral salpingectomy was permanent and there was no way to attempt to reverse the effects. I said that I understood, and was completely fine with that.

**Blood tests and health checks:**

I had my blood tests around a week before my surgery. I would have had them earlier in October, but I was unable to make it. I think they were quite relaxed about it because I had explained that my new GP had recently done a blood test and besides borderline low calcium levels they weren’t concerned about (it was more just a note they made), my blood tests came back fine with nothing flagging up. They also did an ECG with the blood tests, and checked my blood pressure - again nothing flagged up, as for the most part I am physically healthy. He explained that I could take my medication (Mirtazapine) as normal, but that I would need to take any jewellery out etc. It was very quick in and out. I was also aware that I would need to fast essentially since midnight, so no eating from that time and then no drinking from a few hours before admission.

**Surgery:**

So the surgery itself! With the hospital I was at, it was a bit of a faff on at first but the staff were lovely. Essentially, the first message I got when I booked my surgery in told me the date and time, and the ward. They later changed the ward - so I went to the ward they had changed it to. A couple minutes after I arrived, they explained my doctor had just come minutes before me essentially saying that the original ward was correct. All fine, no harm done so I just went to the original ward. I arrived around just after 7:30am, as that was the requested time (it was technically 7am but the ward they mixed me up with didn’t open until 7:30am). However, me being slightly late didn’t cause any issues. I was second in queue. The lady who I assumed did my surgery (I never saw her after meeting her beforehand), essentially emphasised that it was permanent, and asked if I was sure I wanted to go through with it etc. that kind of thing. I explained yes and there was no pushback from her. As expected, she asked if I was okay for a student doctor to be present - me personally, I didn’t care so I agreed. I asked if it was possible for them to look for any abnormalities, specifically any visible endometriosis or fibroids due to my history of periods and other traits I’d experienced. She explained they could do that and were going to anyway because it was routine for them to check my other organs and also the area they were doing the surgery in.

For simplicity, I’ll call the person who accompanied me to my surgery my stepdad. I’m assuming my stepdad was not allowed in the ward with me, as they were very delayed in asking him to leave (not that I needed/wanted him to leave, it was just moreso they mentioned he technically wasn’t supposed to be there as there was a different waiting room for accompaniments of patients). Again, no harm done, just a bit of a faff. I got asked to get into a hospital gown, to give them a urine sample, which I’m assuming was just to make sure I wasn’t pregnant. I also got asked to do a few swabs which I’m assuming was a COVID test. All fine and dandy. They did check my blood pressure, which then I’m assuming prompted them to give and help me into compression socks because my blood pressure was low which they attributed to the obvious lack of eating and drinking. I got told the surgery itself would take about an hour.

There was a lot of the same questions - was I diabetic, what procedure was I expecting, was I definitely certain I wanted it etc. They also explained the procedure to me a couple of times, and the fact it was going to be keyhole and laparoscopic. I can’t remember a lot at the top of my head but they did prewarn me I’d be asked a lot of the same questions so it wasn’t too bad as it was expected.

I believe I was seen around mid-day, so I was waiting around a few hours but not too bad in the grand scheme of things. This was where the faff continued. I overheard someone saying that they hadn’t admitted me properly, so they were worried I wouldn’t get the prescription for pain medication because I wasn’t technically admitted (this later wasn’t an issue). I was given paracetamol around 9/10am, and it was a couple hours when I got called through. And then when I got called through to the wait room which you go into basically minutes before surgery, she asked to see my hospital band. I had never been properly admitted, so I hadn’t been given one. I will say that they did adapt fine and I was never too stressed about the mix ups. The lady who asked for my hospital band essentially said it was fine, she could print me one out and she did. Again, same questions to confirm who I was and that I knew what I was in for. They explained that while there was no expected complications, it was possible that obviously because they were operating on me, they could damage an organ or similar. They said that if that happened, they’d end up having to do an open surgery (I believe just a large cut across my abdomen area) and repairing it. So I wasn’t too concerned because the most likely risk they mentioned was fixable - they did ask if I would be okay if they did have to do an open surgery and I said I had no issue with that. This wasn’t relevant later because I had no complications but they are very transparent so I thought I’d mention.

Then I went through to the surgery room (?) - it might have just been the room to get me under anaesthesia as the surgeon wasn’t in the room but I’m not sure. There were three people in the room. They hooked me up to an ECG again, and also put something on my forehead to monitor brain activity, I can’t remember the name. I believe they were also checking my blood pressure with that weird finger thing but I can’t remember if they took it off before I went under anaesthesia. They sorted the cannula on my hand, which was a bit painful but to be honest wasn’t that bad for me personally as my pain tolerance is somewhat okay. They put some salt water in first just to make sure the cannula worked (I’m assuming) and then they explained that they were going to put some painkiller into me first, I don’t know what type but my best guess would be morphine with a mix of maybe one or two more painkillers (as that was the case for my surgical abortion). She essentially said my head would be fuzzy, and it definitely was but I was still aware of what was happening. She also asked if I had any family history of anaesthesia issues - I have limited knowledge of my family’s medical history, and told her so. I think it was more a precaution as I had never been under anaesthesia myself so they couldn’t go off my history, but she wasn’t too worried that I didn’t know. She put some salt water in the cannula again just to check it was still useable (again I’m assuming as I can’t remember the reasoning she told me) etc. Then they put an oxygen mask on me just to help me breathe. I wasn’t having significant breathing issues, it’s just standard procedure. It also got explained to me that once I was out, they’d be putting a breathing tube into my throat so it’s possible I would have a sore throat for a while after. The main anaesthesiologist explained that she was then going to put the anaesthesia into me and I’d be out in a couple minutes. I recall absolutely nothing from after she said that.

**Post-surgery:**

I woke up at around 2pm (I asked the time and got told it was 3pm for some reason but we ball) in a different room. I wasn’t really in pain immediately, I was just very groggy. I was on one of those beds they can transport, and they transported me to the recovery room basically as soon as I was awake after removing the cannula and the like. They asked me how I was feeling etc and I told them I was fine. They asked me if I wanted my phone, which I did. They’d moved my bags for convenience so that was nice. They asked me if I wanted anything to eat, and if I wanted a drink. Food wise they gave me toast and custard creams. For drink, the initial options were coffee or tea but I don’t like either so they offered me a milkshake and asked me what flavour I’d prefer. They also brought me a jug of water. The toast and milkshake was definitely much needed after not being able to eat or drink for over 12 hours. I would recommend bringing food and drink with you if you can, the hospital I was at wouldn’t have minded if I had. I just didn’t beside a chocolate biscuit because I didn’t have the time in the morning. They explained that I would have to wait a minimum of 2 hours for monitoring, but if everything was fine after 2 hours then I could leave.

I didn’t have issue going to the toilet or anything like that. They had given me a pad (which I noticed when I went to the toilet), which I did appreciate because there was mild bleeding there - nothing too heavy, but enough that the pad had use. In terms of pain, I did have quite bad pain in my right shoulder initially. I didn’t have an issue at first with the actual surgery area but my right shoulder was awful. They prescribed me some morphine for in hospital. I did end up having a blood clot pass through, but they weren’t too concerned because it was a one off and wasn’t too big. She just made me go to the toilet once more before I left to make sure I had no more issues. I got my blood pressure checked a few times, as before the surgery it was quite low. They contributed that to the fact I hadn’t been eating or drinking - once I’d eaten and drank my blood pressure was fine. I asked if I was going to be prescribed pain medication, and explained paracetamol and ibuprofen don’t usually work for me. They ended up prescribing me codeine because that was my preference as I said it did work better than paracetamol or ibuprofen (hit or miss). They also prescribed me laxatives - I’m unsure if it was because of the codeine prescribed, because I know even without codeine people struggle after getting the bilateral salpingectomy. They told me that I’d need to keep the dressing on my incision sites (I have three) for 2 days, and after that I could take them off. They gave me a discharge letter which was either just for me to keep or to give to my new GP because the communication between the two doesn’t exist as I’ve moved countries (now in Scotland) and because of the difference in systems they can’t transfer records over or anything. On the discharge letter itself, it explained the procedure I’d had, it said that they’d prescribed me morphine in the hospital, and then codeine and laxatives for home. They did add that if my GP chose to continue/renew that prescription, that was up to them and a possibility. It stated that there was no complications, and that they were awaiting on results of the histology. They explained it could take between 4-6 weeks for the results of that to come back. For anyone who doesn’t know, histology is basically just taking and testing my tubes to make sure they’re healthy and there’s no tumours/cancers or diseases in general present. I ended up leaving at around 5/6pm I believe.

**Recovery:**

After I left, the pain wasn’t too bad - as said, the most pain I had was in my right shoulder. This has now died down but it’s still noticeable. I did initially have a sore throat, but it wasn’t too significant and it died down overnight. I ended up having to take codeine at around 10pm I believe, but I’m quite stubborn and the pain has been manageable so besides the morphine I had straight after the surgery and the codeine at that time, I’ve not taken anything else. For myself, it hasn’t been too bad pain-wise but I recognise my pain tolerance is a bit better than others and also I’m just stubborn in general so if you have the procedure and need to take the pain medication, please take it! The pain in my abdomen area is a lot more noticeable now I would say but I’ve been trying to be sat or laid down for the most part so really it just feels more like discomfort to me. I’ve been able to be independent in all aspects and also travel so I’m not too concerned with how my recovery will go. Obviously I only had the surgery yesterday so I’m in the very early stages of recovery and pain etc. but I don’t foresee any significant issues (hopefully).

1qp9099,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1qp9099/i_worked_at_a_gas_station_where_no_one_loses_the/,I worked at a gas station where no one loses the lottery,"I used to work nights at the 24-hour Shell on the edge of Elmwood. Flickering sodium lights, the diesel stench that never quite left your clothes, the clock above the register stuck three minutes behind, like even time was too tired to move.

A typical shift was nothing. Count the same pack of Marlboros for the third time at 4 a.m., listen to the coffee machine gurgle like it was dying, watch moths spiral into the bug zapper outside until the pop-pop-pop sounded like distant gunfire. Sometimes a regular drunk, old Ray, would stumble in, buy a tallboy and a single scratchoff he never won. He'd scratch it with his thumbnail, mutter ""next time,"" and shuffle back into the dark. Routine. Safe. Boring enough to make you forget how empty the streets sounded at 3 a.m.

The scratchoff machine sat in the corner like it had always been there. Bulky, beige, older than me. Customers started calling it ""lucky"" after the first few big hits.

Mr. Harlan came in every Tuesday like clockwork. Always the same, Marlboros, one ticket, scratched slow and deliberate with a nickel he kept in his pocket, purposely stored. He'd hum tunelessly while he worked the foil, like he was coaxing the win out. One night he hit $50, tipped me a ten, said, ""See? Patience pays."" Next week $100. He started scratching slower each time, eyes fixed, like he was afraid to miss a silver flake.

Harlan stopped coming by after he won a few more times, odd for a routine driven guy like him.  Sheriff Roland stopped by now and then. Always for a blue raspberry slushy mid shift. “This stuff never gets old.” He said with a blue smile.

I asked him about Mr. Harlan, given that this was the second Tuesday he didn’t show.

“Mind if I ask you something, Sheriff?”

He set the slushy on the counter, adjusted his glasses. “Long as it’s not about parking tickets.”

“Harlan used to come in every Tuesday always the same time. I haven’t seen him since he won a bunch of scratchoff tickets. This is the third week in a row.”

Roland watched the machine while I talked. Didn’t look at me once.

“Trailer was empty when his employer reported him missing,” he said finally. “The lights in the house were all burning, and the fridge door open.”

“That’s weird, anything out of the ordinary?” I asked.

His jaw tightened. Just a little.

“Winning tickets on the dining room table,” he said. “Like somebody left in a hurry.”

I pointed toward the corner where the machine rested. “They came from that machine.”

He took a long pull from the straw, eyes still on the screen with his spectacles reflecting the light it emitted.

“People who catch a break don’t always leave a forwarding address,” he said. “Some folks take the chance to disappear.”

He picked up the slushy and headed for the door.

“You worry too much,” he added. “This town does that to people.”

I watched him go, but the problem was Mr. Harlan wasn’t the only one who’d caught a break. And he wasn’t the only one who’d stopped coming back.

Tammy from the diner across the street used to come in after her graveyard shift, still in her uniform, smelling of grease and cheap cigarettes. She'd buy a ticket, scratch it fast like it owed her money, laugh when she lost. After her $200 win she started showing up later and later, alone, eyes glassy. ""This machine knows me,"" she told me once, voice low. Quit her job the next day. No one saw her after that.

Another case was Jake, the mechanic. Loud enough that you always heard him before you saw him. A loud guy, always mentioned about how he just needed one more win to finally fix the shop “for good.” One night he hit five hundred dollars, the biggest payout I ever saw from that machine. A week later, Jake was dead. His truck went straight off the ravine on Dew Pass. The news spread through town like the flu. People whispered about it, “no skid marks, no swerve”. “Just tire tracks, arrow straight, disappearing over the edge.” Most folks settled on the obvious explanation, that he was drunk, blacked out, another senseless accident. But anyone who knew Jake knew better. He loved two things more than anything else, his truck, and his work.

Mr. Jones loved it. Sales tripled. He hung a little handwritten sign above the machine, “Our Lucky Scratchers!"" with a winking emoji sticker.

When I mentioned how many winners had vanished, he smiled that small, polite smile and said, ""People win, they move on. Life changes. You should play too, Night Boy. Maybe your luck is waiting."" He said it the way someone offers you a mint after they've already slipped something in your drink.

I thought about it longer than I should have. Tried to line things up. Still came up with loose ends. Three people. Same routine. Same machine. All of it breaking the same way after they won. I told myself there were explanations. People change. People make bad decisions when money shows up. That’s what everyone says. But Jake loved that truck. Loved it enough that he wouldn’t even drink if he planned on driving it home. He lived two blocks from his shop. Close enough to walk. So why did he drive up the mountain?

I knew that there was only one way to find out what the hell was going on.  I started testing tickets on slow shifts.

First time I hesitated, stood there staring at the dispenser like it might bite. ""Just one,"" I told myself. ""See if it's really lucky."" Used the same quarter every time, same spot at the counter, same slow scratch. The win felt like a tiny electric kiss, sharp, a rush, followed immediately by cold nausea crawling up my throat. It was the same feeling you get when you deliberately do something you’re not supposed to. After the rush, it felt like the foil was scraping something inside my skull. My hands started shaking the way Tammy’s hands shook. Convinced myself it was the energy drink.

One slow night I tried to warn a guy, middle-aged, quiet, buying a stack for his wife's birthday.

""Hey, man,"" I said, keeping my voice casual.

""Maybe skip these tonight. Weird shit's been happening with winners.""  He laughed.

""You trying to scare off business?"" Mr. Jones appeared from the back, calm as ever.

 ""He's joking. Play if you want. Luck's luck."" The guy bought them anyway. Never saw him or his family again.

The machine started acting in a way that it wanted to be observed. Screen lagging on animations, like it was thinking. Dispenser clicking when no one was near it, soft, expectant. Every time when I turned my back to stock shelves, my skin prickled like someone was staring. As if a shadow was lurking behind me, a felt presence from a specific direction.

My spatial awareness sharpened to a painful clarity. The bug zapper outside fell into sync with my breathing, pop on the inhale, pop on the exhale. Each crack of electricity landed somewhere deep in my chest, every sound and smell arriving amplified, distorted, wrong. I could feel each electrical impulse firing through my synapses, as if my nerves were no longer my own but part of the current itself.

One night the power dipped. Everything died except the machine. Its screen stayed bright, cycling slower. I leaned close. For half a second the text changed,

“I WIN”

Then back to normal.

I would never forget the time a kid, maybe nineteen, came in around 3:00 a.m. He bought ten tickets with crumpled twenties. Scratched them one after another at the counter. The sound was intimate, slow scrape-scrape-scrape of coin on foil, each layer peeling back with a faint metallic sigh. The smell of fresh scratchoff film filled the air, powdery, chemical, distinctive.  

He won every single one. Laughed so hard he started coughing, bought more tickets, then continued scratching, like he couldn’t stop. His fingers sped up, then slowed again careful. Deliberate.

I knew something was wrong before his eyes went empty. He was smiling. He never stopped smiling. By the time I followed him outside, he was sitting in his Civic with the engine running, just staring down at the tickets spread across his lap. The smile was still there, pulled wider than it should’ve been, like his face had forgotten how to relax, or how to look normal. I watched the clock over the register roll forward and back again. He didn’t move for almost an hour.

I tapped the window. Nothing. His mouth moved, stretching soundlessly, working at words that never came. Mucus pouring out of his mouth, dilated pupils which can only be associated with the effect some kind of extreme drug. I called for an ambulance. They didn’t arrive for three hours. By then his hands were locked around the tickets, fingers curled tight like claws. The paramedics had to peel them loose one by one.

After the incident, I couldn’t sleep without dreaming about his face. Not screaming. Not in pain. Just that euphoric, vacant expression.

I kept thinking about it afterwards, he was fine before he bought the tickets.

I broke in on my night off.

I still had the spare key from closing. The store was pitch black, except for the machine’s haze. Its glow pulsed softly, slow and inconsistent, like it was breathing. I stood there longer than I meant to, weighing consequences I already knew I would ignore. I was drawn to it. To the light. To the smell of freshly printed hard paper. To the shimmer of silver foil and the dry whisper it made when peeled away. My mouth watered. The hair along my arms and neck stood on end. Tears pooled in my eye sockets as the urge, to scratch and win swelled until it filled every inch of me. I acknowledged it. Communicated with it without words. I wanted to obey it.

Then a moment slipped past, what felt like a trance, a waking daydream where my body simply took over. My arm reached out on its own, fingers closing in on the print button. I tore myself away and yanked the plug from the wall, heart hammering. The cord came free cleanly. The screen stayed lit.

“The fuck?” I whispered.

I grabbed the broom from the storeroom and struck the screen. It answered with a dull, hollow thump. Something sounded back. A voice. Very close. Very patient.

What came out of the machine could only be described as a distorted grunt. It spoke my name, first, middle, last, slowly, like it was reading from an old report card. Then it said my mother’s name, the way she used to when I was little and in trouble. Soft. Disappointed. The air thickened with the smell of it, powdery, metallic scratchoff foil, undercut by something wetter. Like coins left too long in a corpse’s pocket.

I froze. I clamped my hands over my ears, desperate to shut out the lie. It didn’t sound like her, but I recognized it. Her*.* It*.* The noise swelled anyway, forcing its way through the gaps between my fingers. I squeezed my eyes shut, bracing for something terrible. Light burned through my eyelids, searing white. I gave in to the weight of my body and folded forward, burying my head between my knees. This was it.

Then it stopped. The light. The sound. I opened my eyes slowly.

The store was full of cops.

Mr. Jones told the cops I’d had an episode. He showed them the footage, me standing alone in the dark, perfectly still, eyes fixed on something that wasn’t there, whispering for twenty straight minutes. I didn’t remember any of it. Not the words. Not the time missing. Nothing.

The cops gave me a warning and left it at that. No charges. No paperwork. Just looks. Mr. Jones stood beside them the whole time, calm, smiling softly. When they turned to go, he gave me a little wink, like we shared something.

I told myself I was grateful.

Word spread fast. It always does in towns like this. Night Boy lost it*.* People started asking if I was okay, the way you ask someone with a rash if it’s contagious. Mr. Jones stayed too calm. Customers complained about the missing machine. He told them it was “under repair.”

It never came back.

A few days later I drove past the Shell at 2:00 a.m. again. Lights off except the corner window. A faint glow leaked out, the kind that doesn’t come from fluorescent tubes. The silhouette inside was wrong, too still, too patient. A new machine, maybe. Or the same one, just rolled to the next stop on the line.

Someone stood at the counter. Scratching. Slow. Methodical. The coin moved in tiny, deliberate circles, like they had all the time in the world. Behind them the shadow was taller now. Not moving. Just taller.

I was drawn by it, I accelerated. Didn’t look back.

But every gas station I pass, my fingers twitch for foil. Every time I blink, I see hands, dozens, hundreds, peeling silver in perfect unison. Faces stretched wide, grinning the way winners grin when the numbers finally line up. Mouths open too far. Eyes too bright.

They’re still winning. Still scratching. Still whispering the names back to each other like a prayer they can’t stop saying. The glow moves. It follows me.

Late at night I catch myself murmuring their names. Not mine. Theirs. Curious of what I escaped, and why they failed.

If you drive past one of those machines someday. You’ll feel the pull. Just one ticket. Just to see. And when your fingers close around the foil, when the first silver flake curls away, you’ll hear it.  Your name.

You won’t win it.

It will win you.",4,1769600248.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

* USA — Die Fed tagt später heute. Erwartet wird, dass sie die Zinsen bei 3,50%–3,75% belässt. Entscheidend wird, was Powell danach sagt – vor allem nach dem Einbruch des Konsumklimas auf den schwächsten Stand seit 2014 und dem kräftigen Rutsch des Dollars auf ein Vierjahrestief (Reuters, NYT, Conference Board).
* USA — Trumps Angriffe auf die Fed und die Suche nach einem „gefügigeren“ Fed-Chef sorgen für Unruhe rund um die Unabhängigkeit der Notenbank – während Indizes nahe Allzeithochs stehen und Futures auf leicht positive, tech-getriebene Gewinne hindeuten (WSJ, NYT, Bloomberg).
* Global — Gold hält sich über 5.000 $/oz, Silber über 110 $/oz. Gleichzeitig laufen Agrar- und Soft-Commodity-Themen weiter. Das wirkt wie eine breiter werdende Rohstoffhausse – mit mehr Inputkosten-Risiko Richtung 2026 (Bloomberg, MarketWatch, Yahoo Finance).
* FX — Der WSJ Dollar Index liegt nahe dem tiefsten Stand seit Anfang 2022, nach dem stärksten Tagesrutsch des Greenback seit April 2025. BaFin warnt, dass Märkte beginnen könnten, den Reservewährungsstatus des Dollars stärker zu hinterfragen (WSJ, Reuters).
* Europa/Asien — In Deutschland hellt sich die Konsumstimmung auf, weil die Einkommenserwartungen steigen. In Australien lag die Inflation bei 3,6% (Hoch der letzten sechs Quartale) – das stützt die Erwartung einer RBA-Anhebung nächste Woche und hält die globale Zins-Volatilität hoch (CNBC, Bloomberg, Reuters).

**SPEKULATIVE POSITIONIERUNG**

* Index-Options-Trader sind stark auf die Oberseite ausgerichtet: Put/Call-Volumen bei \~0,20, Put/Call Open Interest bei \~0,18. Tech zieht den Großteil der Call-Prämie an – Stocknear Options Flow (Daten vom 27/01).
* Sektor-Optionsbudgets: Technology-Call-Spending über 1,6 Mrd. $; deutlich weniger Interesse an Defensives. Das zeigt, wie voll der Trade in AI und Mega-Cap Growth ist – auch wenn Hedging in zins- und krypto-sensitiven Namen zunimmt (Stocknear Sector Flow).
* Fear & Greed liegt bei 64 („Greed“). Passt zu anhaltendem Dip-Buying in US-Aktien – trotz Tarifsorgen, Fed-Risiko und Quartalszahlen-Headline-Risiko (Multi-Source Sentiment Composite).

**MAG7 (COVERAGE)**

* [NVDA](https://stocknear.com/stocks/NVDA) — Um $188,52 (gestern +1,1%) nach einer neuen 2-Mrd.-$-Eigenkapitalinvestition in CoreWeave und Chinas Freigabe von H200-AI-Chip-Importen. Große Schlussauktion-/Closing-Blöcke (bis \~1,87 Mrd. $) in Dark Pools deuten weiter auf institutionelle Akkumulation hin – vor den Quartalszahlen am 25/02 (Reuters, Benzinga, Stocknear Dark-Pool).
* [AAPL](https://stocknear.com/stocks/AAPL) — Um $258,27 (gestern +1,1%) vor den Quartalszahlen morgen am 29/01. Rückenwind durch starke iPhone-Share-Daten aus Indien, dazu das Thema „Gemini-powered Siri“ als möglicher Relaunch. Große Closing-Blöcke und neue Buy-Ratings (z. B. JPM PT $315) sprechen eher für Rotation als Kapitulation – gleichzeitig bleibt das AI-Narrativ anfällig, wenn die Messlatte zu hoch hängt (Bloomberg, CNBC, Street Research).
* [MSFT](https://stocknear.com/stocks/MSFT) — Um $480,58 (gestern +2,2%) vor den Quartalszahlen heute Abend. Der neue Maia-200-AI-Chip und der aggressive Data-Center-Ausbau stehen gegen Skepsis zur kurzfristigen AI-Monetarisierung. Große Closing-Blöcke plus bullishes Options-Sentiment zeigen: Viele rechnen wieder mit einem Cloud-/AI-Beat (Reuters, Raymond James, Stocknear Dark-Pool).
* [AMZN](https://stocknear.com/stocks/AMZN) — Um $244,68 (gestern +2,6%) trotz Meldungen zu weiteren \~16k Jobkürzungen und dem Schließen von Fresh/Go-Stores. Fokus bleibt auf AWS-AI-Wachstum und der Supercenter- plus Same-Day-Grocery-Strategie Richtung Quartalszahlen am 05/02. Wiederholte Multi-Millionen-Share-Blöcke wirken wie institutionelles Dip-Buying (Reuters, CNBC, Stocknear Dark-Pool).
* [GOOGL](https://stocknear.com/stocks/GOOGL) — Um $334,55 (gestern \~+0,4%) nach einem Sechs-Monats-Run. EU-Regulatorik drückt auf AI-/Data-Access-Compliance, dazu ein Vergleich über 68 Mio. $ in einem Assistant-Privacy-Fall. Options- und Dark-Pool-Flow bleiben kaufseitig, aber die Aufmerksamkeit für „zu hohe Erwartungen“ steigt vor den Quartalszahlen am 04/02 (Reuters, WSJ, Stocknear Flow).
* [META](https://stocknear.com/stocks/META) — Um $672,97 (nahezu unverändert) vor den Quartalszahlen heute Abend. Der Markt ringt mit dem Spagat: schwere 2026er Capex-Pläne für AI/Data-Center versus starke Ad-Dynamik. Ein mehrjähriger Fiber-Deal mit Corning (bis zu 6 Mrd. $) und Tests bezahlter AI-Abos geben optionalen Upside; große Closing-Blöcke deuten auf eher bullishe Positionierung in der Guidance (CNBC, WSJ, Stocknear Dark-Pool).
* [TSLA](https://stocknear.com/stocks/TSLA) — Um $430,91 (gestern \~-1%) vor den Quartalszahlen heute Abend (Q4). Schwächere Auslieferungen und Marken-Erosion treffen auf frühe Tests unüberwachter Robotaxis in Austin und humanoide Robotik-Ambitionen Richtung 2027. Block-Trade-Daten wirken aktiv, aber nicht einseitig. Der Print wird eher als High-Vol-AI/Robotics-Inflection gehandelt – nicht als reine EV-Story (WSJ, Yahoo Finance, Stocknear Dark-Pool).

**WEITERE UNTERNEHMEN & SEKTORTHEMEN**

* Tech / Semis — [GLW](https://stocknear.com/stocks/GLW) \+15,6% nach einem Meta-Data-Center-Fiber-Deal „bis zu 6 Mrd. $“, der die AI-Infrastruktur-Hebelwirkung schärft (CNBC).
* Tech / Adtech — [TTD](https://stocknear.com/stocks/TTD) Mehrere Häuser senken Kursziele (z. B. auf $38, \~18% Upside) wegen stärkerem Wettbewerb und volatiler Budgets – trotz solider CTV-Long-Term-Tailwinds (Stocknear Analyst Tracker).
* Tech / Cloud — [DOCN](https://stocknear.com/stocks/DOCN) Wamsi Mohan auf Strong Buy mit $72 PT (\~19,6% Upside): robuste SMB-Cloud-Nachfrage, plus bessere AI-Monetarisierung (Zacks / Stocknear).
* Healthcare / Pharma — [JNJ](https://stocknear.com/stocks/JNJ) Ilya Zubkov bleibt bei Hold mit $220 PT (\~2% Downside): Litigation-Overhang und langsameres Top-Line-Wachstum dämpfen den defensiven Reiz (Stocknear).
* Healthcare / Biotech — [BIOA](https://stocknear.com/stocks/BIOA) Yasmeen Rahimi startet Coverage mit Overweight, $73 PT (\~272% Upside): differenzierte Pipeline, High-Risk/High-Reward Aging-Biology-Plattform (Stocknear).
* Energy / Services — [BKR](https://stocknear.com/stocks/BKR) David Anderson bleibt bei Overweight, $57 PT (\~0,9% Upside): resilientes internationales Drilling, stabiler Free-Cash-Flow trotz jüngster Stärke (Stocknear).
* Utilities / Energy Transition — [NRG](https://stocknear.com/stocks/NRG) Julien Dumoulin-Smith bleibt bei Buy, $181 PT (\~16% Upside): gutes Setup für stromhungrige AI-Data-Center-Baseload-Nachfrage (Stocknear).
* Financials / Insurance — [WRB](https://stocknear.com/stocks/WRB) Elyse Greenspan bleibt bei Equal-Weight, $66 PT (\~1,8% Downside): Pricing Power vs. Zyklus-Peak-Margen hält sich die Waage (Stocknear).
* Consumer / Coffee — [SBUX](https://stocknear.com/stocks/SBUX) Zachary Fadem bleibt bei Overweight, $105 PT (\~9,7% Upside): Traffic stabilisiert sich, aber Lohn- und Rohstoffkosten drücken auf die Marge (Stocknear).
* Financials / Banks — [COF](https://stocknear.com/stocks/COF) Brian Foran bleibt bei Buy, $275 PT (\~26,7% Upside): robuste Kredittrends, plus Luft für Kapitalrückgaben (Stocknear).



Options-, Dark-Pool- und News-Flow sprechen weiter für institutionelles Risk-on in AI, Cloud und Quality Cyclicals. Fed, Dollar und Tarifsorgen sorgen trotzdem dafür, dass die Volatilität Richtung dieser Woche (Mega-Cap-Quartalszahlen + Policy-Entscheid) hoch bleibt.

The means as well as the ends.,"I've made some posts over the years. Some about me, and my journey, looking for literal relatability or understanding. Some poetic, reaching out for emotional threads, or attachments based on my writing style, and my mind flow. Some about philosophy, looking for like minds, fellow thinkers and reachers. Some about interests, looking for a foundation based on activity and something tangible.

How about this time I be as clear as I can, with no pretenses. You read this if you're here, if you can. You listen to what I have, and what I think. And you respond, if it means something to you. If you're *weary*, like I am. If you need something but can't find it. If you're tired of being told to suppress your needs. Settle for less. That your needs are wrong. That your search is meaningless.  
You listen to my strength. You bear witness to my weakness. You vow to share yours with me in turn.

**What I need:**

* A witness to my existence: I won't explain the why here; this is clarity. I don't need to. It's intrinsic, and it's who I am. It's my meaning, at least for now.
* To witness you: I need you to need that too. Maybe not as much as I do, but enough. What do I mean by a witness? It's what I view as a proof of existence. Not the only proof. Not even the only proof that matters, not even that yours or my existence needs a proof. It's what I want. The empathy given and taken from another parallel life. From the knowledge that you mean something to them, and them to you.
* An end to loneliness: The loneliness doesn't come from lack of self-worth. I am worth a lot, and so are you. We must share our worth. As we are. We will change over time, if we want to, and then we will be worth something different. But still enough. Always enough. The world does not define either of our worth's. The loneliness I feel is intrinsic, and frigid. It's existential. I was born with it, and it will never fade. *You can't fix it. I don't need fixing. I can't fix yours*. Yet I know what I need, and I can provide it to you in return. True understanding. A flame that won't melt the ice but will warm us beyond just the suffering. The gentle warmth from a fellow shoulder in a cave of ice means more than anything when all you've ever known is the blizzard.
* Your Strength: Every step of every waking moment takes immense strength and courage. For some people, it costs almost nothing. Its natural. It's life. For me, and people like us, it's a war. A war against being suspended in a world of chaos, and of forgetting why we bother to walk at all. The crushing weight of the world, of humanity, of expectations, of ourselves... Let me walk beside you. Not because we are weak, but because we can be stronger with support. Perhaps not strong enough. But stronger.
* Comfort: This isn't codependency. I'm not making an offer to force us to be alive for the sake of it. I don't want us to simply form a new cage to live in; one of our own making this time. It's about more than just help and support. It's about the wants, and not just the needs. I am hilarious, I'm sure you are too. I want to be your joy and your entertainment. The hand that holds yours in the light, and in the darkness. I need it myself. A soft joke in the same cave will further shatter the notion of the blizzard.
* *Commitment*: Why do some relationships last, and others fail? I don't have all the answers. Nobody does. There are theories; there are differences between real life tangible encounters and online interactions, but it doesn't matter. If there is any hope, we must fight for it. Even if it's hard. Even if the messages get shorter. If the calls start to feel like an obligation. We must believe that it is temporary, and we must remember the core of why. I need your fight, and I will give mine. This is not a fantasy. It's our reality.
* Curiosity: I want your mind. And I want to share mine. It's the core of my value. I don't offer it lightly, but I want to share it. It's all of me. The grand philosophical ideals. The small victories. The miniscule desires, the mundane details of your life. The impossible dreams. The sorrows. The nostalgia. The failures. I want to explore your thoughts, feelings, ambitions... Without shame. Without judgement. I want you to want to search for something with me. Even if it's hard. Even if it's slow. I want to learn and grow with you by my side.
* You: I am what I am, and you are what you are. The self is beautiful, as long as it's yours. Share it with me and hear mine. It's all I have to offer, and all I need in return. At the end of the world. It will be just us. If we were the last two people facing the final abyss, what would our life have been? Will you lament that we didn't have more? Will you resent us? Me? Resent the world? Resent existence? It doesn't matter to me. You are enough. The ends and the means. There will be more, but we can be each other's foundations. Or the architecture. Whichever you prefer.

*All that matters is if this made you feel anything*, and if you can offer and receive something that we both want. If you're scared that I've said everything, then just ask. If you want to know more, then ask. We can have the same conversation as many times as it takes. If you're intimidated by my loudness, then let me hear your quiet thoughts. I'm quiet too. I'm shy too. This took years to come out, perhaps a lifetime depending on your perspective.

That wasn't clear. I said this was going to be about clarity. It was still stupidly, amateurishly poetic. It still appealed to emotion. I still want you to gauge my style, and my philosophy. I didn't have a plan. It isn't everything I need or want, maybe I made mistakes, but it's a start. 

**Who I am (Optional but necessary pragmatism):**

I figured that starting with reasonably clear (? I tried) definitions of what I want, need, and value would show my sincerity and intentionality. The purpose was to seek loudly. It's nice and romantic to brush hands with someone at a coffee shop and now they're your soulmate, but it gets harder the more demanding and complex you are (and how socially isolated). It's not necessarily a good/bad thing; it just is a thing.

However, it still matters who I am, what I like, and how we can get along in a pragmatic sense (I hate pragmatism, let me live in my ideals dammit).  
I think it's been clear from the above that I need some sort of relational catalyst for motivation and meaning in a world that has lost that for me. It means that I struggle to do things sometimes. The word that didn't exist when I was younger is ""avolition"", and I think it's a reasonably accurate description of me and my state. It's not a diagnosis; it's a symptom of being what I am. Is there a solution? I don't know yet. I'm not a problem to be solved, I'm just an existential anomaly. But me being here means I've identified at least one possible course of action, and some sort of desire. The bare minimum to be human?

The point of all that is that I like things, but I don't always do things, even the ones that I like. I'm also terrible at finishing things, partly because of motivation, and partly because I don't like it when things end. If I don't finish, it's still a nice open thread in my mind that I can pursue whenever I want, it's just the want is the problem. There are other times where I'll hyperfixate and devour something. It just depends. I don't like schedules, I just like doing the things that I want, when I want.

An emotional/philosophical connection is more important. I think it can be enough. But ideally, we need to ground ourselves with something tangible. Anything. Something we do together, or create together, or regular check ins/voice calls, body doubling etc. I prefer text at first, but I think we need to voice chat rather soon for the tangible, and also just to see if the vibes work beyond the theoretical.

Here's the list of potential activities that I do on my own/want to do.

* It's probably clear that I like books and philosophy. I wouldn't consider myself well read on either, although I am quite familiar with philosophy. I've also never really had any book friends to feed off of their motivation. Maybe we can start a book club?
* I play video games of course. I like them all. Big ones, tiny indie ones, silly ones, but I have to be in the mood for specific ones. I feel like co-op PVE games tend to lack depth and be a little boring sadly, as they are the bulk of what people play together. I'm not a gamey sort of person and I value immersion. I like League of Legends a lot for the complexity and pure moment-to-moment engagement. It's very absorbing. Play with me. Join us.
* I used to enjoy studying. I was very self-motivated to learn for myself in the past, and I definitely want that again for the future if I can manage it. I ended up doing computer science in university until I realised that the real world and I weren't exactly compatible. It wasn't me it was the world. It was a bad break up too, lots of loose ends. In my dream world I'd be some kind of academic, and maybe that ship hasn't completely sailed. We'll see. Let's learn some stuff together, read poetry, study things the world has deemed useless, pore over ancient texts and esoteric symbols. Let's have a study group.
* I love kitters and I have two of them. They ground me when I'm about to float off into despair land. Accept and sent pictures.

I think a lot. I feel many things. I also feel nothing sometimes. I'm on both sides of the despair and whimsy spectrum. I feel like part 2 of the thesis on myself has been truer to my actual personality. This is what I'm really like beyond all the honesty and truth. I'll joke about everything and tease you all the time. I'll ask you probing questions, and equally nonsense ones. You'll never see it coming. I'll support your bad decisions, and your good ones. We'll make some together.",1,1769600024.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False
1qp8xo7,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1qp8xo7/i_worked_at_a_gas_station_where_no_one_loses_the/,I worked at a gas station where no one loses the lottery,"I used to work nights at the 24-hour Shell on the edge of Elmwood. Flickering sodium lights, the diesel stench that never quite left your clothes, the clock above the register stuck three minutes behind, like even time was too tired to move.

A typical shift was nothing. Count the same pack of Marlboros for the third time at 4:00 a.m., listen to the coffee machine gurgle like it was dying and watch moths spiral into the bug zapper outside until the pop-pop-pop sounded like distant gunfire. Sometimes a regular drunk, old Ray, would stumble in, buy a tallboy and a single scratchoff he never won. Hed scratch it with his thumbnail, mutter ""next time,"" and shuffle back into the dark. Routine. Safe. Boring enough to make you forget how empty the streets sounded at 3 a.m.

The scratchoff machine sat in the corner like it had always been there. Bulky, beige, older than me. Customers started calling it ""lucky"" after the first few big hits.

Mr Harlan came in every Tuesday like clockwork. Always the same, Marlboros, one ticket, scratched slow and deliberate with a nickel he kept in his pocket, purposely stored. He'd hum tunelessly while he worked the foil, like he was coaxing the win out. One night he hit $50, tipped me a ten, said, ""See? Patience pays."" Next week $100. He started scratching slower each time, eyes fixed, like he was afraid to miss a silver flake.

Harlan stopped coming by after he won a few more times, odd for a routine driven guy like him.  Sheriff Roland stopped by now and then. Always for a blue raspberry slushy mid shift. “This stuff never gets old.” He said with a blue smile.

I asked him about Mr. Harlan, given that this was the second Tuesday he didn’t show.

“Mind if I ask you something, Sheriff?”

He set the slushy on the counter, adjusted his glasses. “Long as it’s not about parking tickets.”

“Harlan used to come in every Tuesday always the same time. I haven’t seen him since he won a bunch of scratchoff tickets. This is the third week in a row.”

Roland watched the machine while I talked. Didn’t look at me once.

“Trailer was empty when his employer reported him missing,” he said finally. “The lights in the house were all burning, and the fridge door open.”

“That’s weird, anything out of the ordinary?” I asked.

His jaw tightened. Just a little.

“Winning tickets on the dining room table,” he said. “Like somebody left in a hurry.”

I pointed toward the corner where the machine rested. “They came from that machine.”

He took a long pull from the straw, eyes still on the screen with his spectacles reflecting the light it emitted.

“People who catch a break don’t always leave a forwarding address,” he said. “Some folks take the chance to disappear.”

He picked up the slushy and headed for the door.

“You worry too much,” he added. “This town does that to people.”

I watched him go, but the problem was Mr. Harlan wasn’t the only one who’d caught a break. And he wasn’t the only one who’d stopped coming back.

Tammy from the diner across the street used to come in after her graveyard shift, still in her uniform, smelling of grease and cheap cigarettes. She'd buy a ticket, scratch it fast like it owed her money, laugh when she lost. After her $200 win she started showing up later and later, alone, eyes glassy. ""This machine knows me,"" she told me once, voice low. Quit her job the next day. No one saw her after that.

Another case was Jake, the mechanic. Loud enough that you always heard him before you saw him. A loud guy, always mentioned about how he just needed one more win to finally fix the shop “for good.” One night he hit five hundred dollars, the biggest payout I ever saw from that machine. A week later, Jake was dead. His truck went straight off the ravine on Dew Pass. The news spread through town like the flu. People whispered about it, “no skid marks, no swerve”. “Just tire tracks, arrow straight, disappearing over the edge.” Most folks settled on the obvious explanation, that he was drunk, blacked out, another senseless accident. But anyone who knew Jake knew better. He loved two things more than anything else, his truck, and his work.

Mr. Jones loved it. Sales tripled. He hung a little handwritten sign above the machine, “Our Lucky Scratchers!"" with a winking emoji sticker.

When I mentioned how many winners had vanished, he smiled that small, polite smile and said, ""People win, they move on. Life changes. You should play too, Night Boy. Maybe your luck is waiting."" He said it the way someone offers you a mint after they've already slipped something in your drink.

I thought about it longer than I should have. Tried to line things up. Still came up with loose ends. Three people. Same routine. Same machine. All of it breaking the same way after they won. I told myself there were explanations. People change. People make bad decisions when money shows up. That’s what everyone says. But Jake loved that truck. Loved it enough that he wouldn’t even drink if he planned on driving it home. He lived two blocks from his shop. Close enough to walk. So why did he drive up the mountain?

I knew that there was only one way to find out what the hell was going on.  I started testing tickets on slow shifts.

First time I hesitated, stood there staring at the dispenser like it might bite. ""Just one,"" I told myself. ""See if it's really lucky."" Used the same quarter every time, same spot at the counter, same slow scratch. The win felt like a tiny electric kiss, sharp, a rush, followed immediately by cold nausea crawling up my throat. It was the same feeling you get when you deliberately do something you’re not supposed to. After the rush, it felt like the foil was scraping something inside my skull. My hands started shaking the way Tammy’s hands shook. Convinced myself it was the energy drink.

One slow night I tried to warn a guy, middle-aged, quiet, buying a stack for his wife's birthday.

""Hey, man,"" I said, keeping my voice casual.

""Maybe skip these tonight. Weird shit's been happening with winners.""  He laughed.

""You trying to scare off business?"" Mr. Jones appeared from the back, calm as ever.

 ""He's joking. Play if you want. Luck's luck."" The guy bought them anyway. Never saw him or his family again.

The machine started acting in a way that it wanted to be observed. Screen lagging on animations, like it was thinking. Dispenser clicking when no one was near it, soft, expectant. Every time when I turned my back to stock shelves, my skin prickled like someone was staring. As if a shadow was lurking behind me, a felt presence from a specific direction.

My spatial awareness sharpened to a painful clarity. The bug zapper outside fell into sync with my breathing, pop on the inhale, pop on the exhale. Each crack of electricity landed somewhere deep in my chest, every sound and smell arriving amplified, distorted, wrong. I could feel each electrical impulse firing through my synapses, as if my nerves were no longer my own but part of the current itself.

One night the power dipped. Everything died except the machine. Its screen stayed bright, cycling slower. I leaned close. For half a second the text changed,

“I WIN”

Then back to normal.

I would never forget the time a kid, maybe nineteen, came in around 3:00 a.m. He bought ten tickets with crumpled twenties. Scratched them one after another at the counter. The sound was intimate, slow scrape-scrape-scrape of coin on foil, each layer peeling back with a faint metallic sigh. The smell of fresh scratchoff film filled the air, powdery, chemical, distinctive.  

He won every single one. Laughed so hard he started coughing, bought more tickets, then continued scratching, like he couldn’t stop. His fingers sped up, then slowed again careful. Deliberate.

I knew something was wrong before his eyes went empty. He was smiling. He never stopped smiling. By the time I followed him outside, he was sitting in his Civic with the engine running, just staring down at the tickets spread across his lap. The smile was still there, pulled wider than it should’ve been, like his face had forgotten how to relax, or how to look normal. I watched the clock over the register roll forward and back again. He didn’t move for almost an hour.

I tapped the window. Nothing. His mouth moved, stretching soundlessly, working at words that never came. Mucus pouring out of his mouth, dilated pupils which can only be associated with the effect some kind of extreme drug. I called for an ambulance. They didn’t arrive for three hours. By then his hands were locked around the tickets, fingers curled tight like claws. The paramedics had to peel them loose one by one.

After the incident, I couldn’t sleep without dreaming about his face. Not screaming. Not in pain. Just that euphoric, vacant expression.

I kept thinking about it afterwards, he was fine before he bought the tickets.

I broke in on my night off.

I still had the spare key from closing. The store was pitch black, except for the machine’s haze. Its glow pulsed softly, slow and inconsistent, like it was breathing. I stood there longer than I meant to, weighing consequences I already knew I would ignore. I was drawn to it. To the light. To the smell of freshly printed hard paper. To the shimmer of silver foil and the dry whisper it made when peeled away. My mouth watered. The hair along my arms and neck stood on end. Tears pooled in my eye sockets as the urge, to scratch and win swelled until it filled every inch of me. I acknowledged it. Communicated with it without words. I wanted to obey it.

Then a moment slipped past, what felt like a trance, a waking daydream where my body simply took over. My arm reached out on its own, fingers closing in on the print button. I tore myself away and yanked the plug from the wall, heart hammering. The cord came free cleanly. The screen stayed lit.

“The fuck?” I whispered.

I grabbed the broom from the storeroom and struck the screen. It answered with a dull, hollow thump. Something sounded back. A voice. Very close. Very patient.

What came out of the machine could only be described as a distorted grunt. It spoke my name, first, middle, last, slowly, like it was reading from an old report card. Then it said my mother’s name, the way she used to when I was little and in trouble. Soft. Disappointed. The air thickened with the smell of it, powdery, metallic scratchoff foil, undercut by something wetter. Like coins left too long in a corpse’s pocket.

I froze. I clamped my hands over my ears, desperate to shut out the lie. It didn’t sound like her, but I recognized it. Her*.* It*.* The noise swelled anyway, forcing its way through the gaps between my fingers. I squeezed my eyes shut, bracing for something terrible. Light burned through my eyelids, searing white. I gave in to the weight of my body and folded forward, burying my head between my knees. This was it.

Then it stopped. The light. The sound. I opened my eyes slowly.

The store was full of cops.

Mr. Jones told the cops I’d had an episode. He showed them the footage, me standing alone in the dark, perfectly still, eyes fixed on something that wasn’t there, whispering for twenty straight minutes. I didn’t remember any of it. Not the words. Not the time missing. Nothing.

The cops gave me a warning and left it at that. No charges. No paperwork. Just looks. Mr. Jones stood beside them the whole time, calm, smiling softly. When they turned to go, he gave me a little wink, like we shared something.

I told myself I was grateful.

Word spread fast. It always does in towns like this. Night Boy lost it*.* People started asking if I was okay, the way you ask someone with a rash if it’s contagious. Mr. Jones stayed too calm. Customers complained about the missing machine. He told them it was “under repair.”

It never came back.

A few days later I drove past the Shell at 2:00 a.m. again. Lights off except the corner window. A faint glow leaked out, the kind that doesn’t come from fluorescent tubes. The silhouette inside was wrong, too still, too patient. A new machine, maybe. Or the same one, just rolled to the next stop on the line.

Someone stood at the counter. Scratching. Slow. Methodical. The coin moved in tiny, deliberate circles, like they had all the time in the world. Behind them the shadow was taller now. Not moving. Just taller.

I was drawn by it, I accelerated. Didn’t look back.

But every gas station I pass, my fingers twitch for foil. Every time I blink, I see hands, dozens, hundreds, peeling silver in perfect unison. Faces stretched wide, grinning the way winners grin when the numbers finally line up. Mouths open too far. Eyes too bright.

They’re still winning. Still scratching. Still whispering the names back to each other like a prayer they can’t stop saying. The glow moves. It follows me.

Late at night I catch myself murmuring their names. Not mine. Theirs. Curious of what I escaped, and why they failed.

If you drive past one of those machines someday. You’ll feel the pull. Just one ticket. Just to see. And when your fingers close around the foil, when the first silver flake curls away, you’ll hear it.  Your name.

You won’t win it.

It will win you.",1,1769600017.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False
1qp8wl9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qp8wl9,"Finally copped the NY Zip-up I've been eyeing. 🗽 Plus some other pickups (Carhartt, CH, ERD). Which one would you rock?","1. Godspeed ""Doberman"" Hoodie

Heavy 2000s metal/streetwear energy. The graphic is massive and the ""Godspeed"" font is classic.It's a statement piece, but definitely niche. If the print quality holds up after a wash, it’s a win. A bit loud for daily wear, but great for a specific fit.

Score: 7/10

2. Alo Yoga Black Hoodie

Ultra-minimalist ""clean girl/guy"" aesthetic.It’s basically just a high-end blank. The material feels soft, but honestly, you're paying for the tiny ""alo"" logo. Good for the gym or a coffee run, but nothing groundbreaking.

Score: 6.5/10

3. Stüssy ""Built Tough"" Hoodie

Classic West Coast streetwear.You can't really go wrong with Stüssy. The back graphic is iconic, though these ""paragraph"" prints are starting to feel a bit played out in some circles. Still a solid, reliable piece for the rotation.

Score: 7.5/10

4. NY Zip-Up Hoodie (The Grail of the haul) ⭐

Peak ""Old School New York"" meets modern silhouette.This is easily my favorite piece. The navy is deep, the white NY logo pop is perfect, and the crop/oversized cut looks way better in person than the others. It’s got that effortless ""I just threw this on"" look that actually takes effort to pull off. Absolute banger.

Score: 9.5/10

5. Carhartt WIP Heart Hoodie

Workwear but make it ""soft.""The grey heather is a nice break from all the dark colors. The heart logo is a cool twist on the standard patch. It feels sturdy, like it’ll actually last a decade.

Score: 8/10

6. Enfants Riches Déprimés (ERD) Green Hoodie

Punk-luxury / ""I'm rich and bored.""That neon green is aggressive. You really have to have the confidence to pull this off without looking like a highlighter. The ""enfants"" box logo is clean, but the color makes it hard to style regularly.

Score: 6/10

7. Needles Track Jacket (Dusty Pink/Purple)

Sophisticated Japanese vintage sportswear.The colorway is unique—kind of a mauve/taupe with purple stripes. Needles always hits, but it can look like a pajamas top if you don't style it with the right trousers.

Score: 8/10

8. Vetements All-Over Logo Knit

Total logomania chaos.This is a ""love it or hate it"" piece. It’s objectively ""too much,"" but that’s the whole point of Vetements. It’s heavy and feels premium, but you'll definitely get looks (not all of them good).

Score: 5.5/10 (Subjective, but it's a lot to handle)

9. Chrome Hearts Belt

High-end Rockstar aesthetic.This is a solid pick if you want to elevate a basic denim fit. The silver-tone hardware is sleek, and the logo isn't as overbearing as a massive ""H"" or ""GG"" buckle, which keeps it a bit more tasteful. It’s a versatile piece that bridges the gap between the loud graphics and the cleaner hoodies in your haul.

Score: 8/10

10. Chrome Hearts Orange Cross Camo Hat

Early 2000s trucker style meets luxury streetwear.This is a bold choice. The orange cross patches against the camo are high-contrast and definitely demand attention. While it's a ""grail"" item for many, camo can be tricky to style without looking like you're heading to the woods unless the rest of your fit is very intentional. It pairs perfectly with the Godspeed hoodie if you're going for that aggressive, ""loud"" look.

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Between work, school, cooking, cleaning, activities, I'm busy from 6 to 10pm, with maybe ten minutes for coffee in the morning.

A couple of weeks ago I couldn't even start making a camping list, I was too stressed. Then I remembered an app I made for my cousin, a plumber, to manage his website and tasks. I used it to make a camping checklist. Just getting the list out felt like a huge relief. I literally made it sitting on the toilet.

When we were house hunting, every Monday I'd get 5-10 calls from real estate agents. I used to pick up every single one because I worried it might be the school.

They were quite mushy, smelled weird and would've probably not survived dormancy untreated.

Anyhow at that point, since I've had prior experience with succulents primarily, I tried a method more commonly used on cacti cuttings.

What you need:
Ethanol/isopropyl alcohol (70%);
Powdered sulfur (can also be powdered using a coffee grinder if bought as granules);
Diatomaceous earth (DE);
Peroxide 1-3%;
A knife/scalpel/razor blade;

What to do:
1. Wash the corm well, try to get as much organic material as possible removed. This includes leaf remnants, roots, callous bits etc.
2. (Recommended) Place corm into 1-3% peroxide solution for a minute or so, make sure to dry the corm afterwards with paper towels.
3. Get a knife/scalpel/razor blade and sanitize in 70% ethanol/isopropyl mixed with 3-10% peroxide solution (although the peroxide is optional). Wipe afterwards with clean paper towel.
4. Cut away rotten bits, disinfecting the tool after each cut. After the corm seems to no longer have any bits of rot cut away a few millimeters more just to be safe.
4. Now mix powdered sulfur with DE. Exact ratio doesn't matter, but 50/50 seems to work best. Take the mix and apply generously on cut areas. Best to use a brush and gloves to protect your skin. The sulfur kills and prevents new pathogens from taking root, whereas DE seems to work as both an insect deterrent and a drying agent.
5. Leave for 1-2 days, after which wash away with water and inspect for new spots of rot. If the wound starts to show signs of rotting again - repeat the cutting part. If not - apply a new coat of DE and sulfur mix. Check again after a day or two.
6. After a week or two the wound should have completely calloused and dried. Apply one last coat of the mix and store until planting. 
7. For any corms and tubers that are rot free - dust a bit of sulfur anyway, without the DE, to prevent rot in storage.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

I don't know what to do anymore. I just want someone to talk to. My mum is treating me awfully, and I hate to admit that, as I love her so much. She's my mum. The only way to stop her from being mad at me is to agree with her, even if I don't.

Everyday I try to believe she understands what I am feeling. But she doesn't. Just this morning, she gave me pile of clothes to put away. I put away half. I told her I will do the rest after my 24 hour ECG appointment later today, and she got mad at me and told me to do it all now.

I go downstairs afterwards and make an iced coffee. I greet her kindly and she tells me things have to change. She says it doesn't feel right what I am doing *(for context, I have been unemployed since July 2024, and since February 2025 I have been volunteering 2 days a week, roughly 6 hours a week, at a mental health charity as reception and admin)* and that she believes I can do more than I want to.

Just yesterday I was yelled at by my brother for being on PIP and I quote ""earning more than working people do"". My mum then kept going on how I need to find a job, like part time in retail. I keep telling her I can't. But she doesn't listen. It makes me feel awful for not working.

I feel awful napping during the day.

I feel awful wearing ""easy"" clothing

I feel awful getting upgrades for my wheelchair because ""I will give up on walking""

I can keep going on and on. Just today, she told me I am throwing insults at her face because I told her she doesn't understand what it is like for me. She goes ""Oh okay, so that's why I do all these things for you."".

This is so hard. There are times she can be lovely. But this is happening more and more and I am so tired. So so tired. I just need to talk to someone who will understand, please.

I spent $100 on diamonds at the beginning of the game. I've written early and mid game strategy guides, and consider myself a min-maxer. Here is my ultimate guide I would follow myself if I started the game over.

**\******Disclaimer*** \- I will not be talking about the best skills/natures in this guide. I highly recommend doing your own research to educate yourself on what sub skills and natures are best for each Pokemon. A quick reddit search will give you a trove of amazing guides.

**TLDR** \- Aim to cover every ingredient with a strong AAA ingredient specialist. Max out a strong pot expander, meal crit, and healer specialist. Power up and max out the strongest recipes in the game. Then aim for strong berry specialist coverage.

# Game stages:

|Game stage|Pokemon level|
|:-|:-|
|Early game|Lv. 1-30|
|Mid game|Lv. 30-50|
|Late game|Lv. 50-60|



# Early game (~6months):

|Pokemon type|Pokemon level|
|:-|:-|
|Ingredient (AAB or AAA only)|Lv. 1-30|
|Berry|Lv. 1-25|
|Skill|Lv. 1-25|

  
**General Overview**

The main goal here is to catch as many pokemon as possible and raise them to their first major unlocks (see table above). Don't worry about drowsy power. Your goal should be to try and cover as many ingredients as possible, while hunting for your three core skill specialists (see below).

**Pokemon to target**  
1. Healer (Sylveon or Wigglytuff)  
2. AAB and AAA ingredient specialists (Kanto starters)  
3. Pot expansion (Magnezone)  
4. Cooking crit (Dedenne)

**General Strategies**  
1. Focus on catching AAB, and AAA ingredient mons with strong stats  
2. Focus on powering up your strongest meals  
3. Focus on powering up Area bonus on Green Grass to max before leaving  
4. Aim to power up your usable pokemon to their first major unlocks (see table above)  
5. Stockpile resources (candy and dreamshards)

**General Tips**  
1. Stay on Green Grass until max Area bonus before moving on.  
2. Don't invest beyond pokemon lv. thresholds unless they are god tier.   
3. It's okay to invest in mediocre pokemon to their first unlocks, you can easily replace later.  
4. If you can afford it, premium pass even for a couple months is immensely helpful.

# Mid game (6-18months):

|Pokemon type|Pokemon level|
|:-|:-|
|Ingredient (AAB or AAA only)|Lv. 31-50|
|Berry|Lv. 26-50|
|Skill|Lv. 26-50 (Main skill lv. 6-7)|

  
**General Overview**

At this point you should have a strong core group of ingredient farmers, and a decent healer. Your goal is to start targeting the specific pokemon you need to round out your core specialists (cooking crit + expansion), missing ingredients, and even upgrading existing pokemon on your team (ie. hunting a good gardevoir to replace wiggly). Focus on expanding your pot and powering up more and more powerful dishes. You can start island hopping to target specific pokemon and power up area bonuses. By the end of this phase you will start to leverage event weeks to hit M20 on the first half of the available islands. 

**Pokemon to target**  
1. Gardevior (to replace sylveon or wiggly)  
2. Missing AAB and AAA ingredient specialists  
3. Pot expansion (Magnezone)  
4. Cooking crit (Dedenne)  
5. God tier berry specialists for different berry coverage

**General Strategies**  
1. Prioritize missing ingredient mons first, then replace mediocre ones  
2. Aim to find a long term healer option (gardevoir or pawmot)  
3. Find and power up a long term cooking crit and pot expansion specialist.  
4. Aim to power up your usable pokemon to next subskill unlocks (Lv. 50)  
5. Expand pot size and focus on maxing out high level recipes  
6. Leverage event weeks to hit M20 on first 3 islands.

**General Tips**  
1. Don't hesitate to island hop to target specific pokemon you need.  
2. It's okay to invest in lv. 50 ing AAB specialist if they are god tier with lv 50 skill unlock.  
3. Invest in a larger ingredient bag if you find yourself maxing out often.   
4. Use dreamshards, main skill, and sub skills sparingly, you'll need these in the late game.  


# Late game (18+months):

|Pokemon type|Pokemon level|
|:-|:-|
|Ingredient (AAB or AAA only)|Lv. 50-60|
|Berry|Lv. 50-60|
|Skill|Lv. 50|

  
**General Overview**

At this point you are simply living on GG expert farming shards, or jumping to newly released islands to catch new mons or unlock new ingredients. You are powering up the strongest dishes in the game to max, while upgrading your AAB mons to AAA mons. You have a collection of near god tier berry specialists for almost every berry. Every week has a different goal which generally is around targeting a very specific pokemon, or stock piling shards and candy for the next event. You are leveraging event weeks to hit m20 on the late game islands and building Area bonus on GG expert. 

**Pokemon to target**  
1. Upgrading AAB to AAA mons  
2. Powering up berry specialists for every berry type  
3. Gulpin and lucario for farming dreamshards  
4. Ingredient farmers for new ingredients (pumpkin and avocado as of this post)  


**General Strategies**  
1. Power up the strongest meals for each meal type to max  
2. Farm dreamshards on GG expert and/or with dream shard magnet mons  
3. Leverage event weeks to hit M20 on remaining islands  
4. Target and upgrade existing pokemon roster  
5. Level up AAA ing specialists to Lv. 60  
6. Hunt and level up god tier berry specialists for each berry type

**General Tips**  
1. Ingredient coverage and meal power is still the highest priority  
2. This phase is all about buttoning up missing berry/ing coverage while upgrading rosters  
3. Strategies around resource stockpiling and usage are incredibly important

# General Notes

**Charge skill M** \- While this is a very strong skill, I don't recommend you target it. There will naturally be mornings where you have no good ingredient pokemon options to befriend and have to throw a biscuit at something else. Odds are you will naturally come across a good one. If you do, don't hesitate using it, but I will say that I have near god tier Ampharos, Espeon, Golduck, Darkrai, and Raikou at level 50 with maxed main skills and I rarely ever use any of them outside of super niche situations.

**Powering up AAB specialists** \- You'll also notice I mentioned it's okay to power up a god tier AAB specialists to lv. 50 (which goes against a lot of the recommendations out there). Getting a pokemon to lv 60 is very very very resource intensive. Finding a god tier AAA ingredient specialist is very very very rare. It's very possible that you have a godt tier AAB specialist that at lv. 50 matches or even outperforms a decent AAA specialist. It's up to you to run the numbers on RaenonX and see if it's worth the power up. I currently have god tier AAB specialists at lv. 50 for corn, potato, coffee, honey, avocado, and egg that do me just fine, and hey maybe they release an item that lets you reroll one of the ingredient slots... a man can dream.

While this guide is by no means exhaustive, I'm curious what you all think? Anything major I missed? I'm happy to answer any questions or provide more details and clarification in the comments. ",5,1769599290.0,PokemonSleep,10,0.86,False

We’ve been living together for the past 4 years and recently moved quite far away from our friends and family for a fresh start together in our second rented home.

I own my own business and put in a lot of hours. When we first met 5 years ago, I used to work 7 days a week. She was the one that suggested I worked a bit less to balance work and life better. So I did 5-6 days from then. Also in the first year of when we met, we both didn’t want any kids or wasn’t sure of wanting any.

I get a lot of stress related issues with my business and I always come home to tell her about it. The past two years especially, all I do is work, come home, speak about work and tell her about my problems which stresses her out. I tell her because she’s my partner and I expected emotional support etc.

3 months ago, we moved to our new house (renting) with a one year rolling tenancy. After moving, she’s told me for the past year she’s been wanting to start a family and have a child. I said maybe in a couple years but not now. She keeps hinting at it but I keep pushing it for later.

There was a point where we were going to break up because she says we’re different people now, when we first met compared to now, she says she’s grown as a person and has different priorities whereas me, I’m still the same as when she first met me.

She told me she feels no emotional connection with me and doesn’t feel a spark. It’s been lost for the past 2 years because of all the stress I bought her, she just felt like a work colleague and not a partner. She also says we both want different things. Last month when we were nearly at break up point, I said I’d do everything I can to change and not talk about work or bring home anymore stress. I said I’d give her more attention and spend more time with her.

I’ve changed for the past month and done what I haven’t been doing the past two years. She recently suggested maybe we need a break. I said do you want to break up? She said she doesn’t as part of her is still holding onto us as she still really loves me and also sees me as a best friend. She wants the spark to come back for her and she says currently, she feels like she’s just forcing herself to be happy with me when she isn’t.

To add to that, she was speaking to another guy online recently who lived in another country. When I found out, she said he was giving her the emotional connection that I wasn’t giving, she said she wants both but knows realistically she can’t have both. I told her to get rid of this guy so we can focus on bringing her spark back for me. She has and now I’m asking what can I do to help bring sparks back for her?

The past month, I’ve been making her tea/coffee in the morning, giving her daily hugs and kisses, telling her I love her, showing more affection and listening to her better as before I wasn’t a great listener. I’ve also bought her flowers. We’ve also been having a lot of sex, whereas the past 2 years, we hardly did have sex.

We spoke yesterday and she said the past month with my changes, she hasn’t really felt much change in her feelings for me. I said maybe she needs to give it more time? But as mentioned before, we’ve been having a lot of sex and she’s been showing me affection, touching my hair a lot, looking at me like she still fancies me. That’s why I have hope as she says she still finds me attractive.

One key thing to mention to is, I’ve recently said I’m happy to bring the date forward and start having a family if that was the main issue too. Also, we’re together at home everyday due to our recent move and she’s currently unemployed.

Now I’m in the hope that I can continue with my changes, her knowing I’m willing to have a family with her sooner and her feelings for me can come back?

* US — Fed meets later today and is expected to hold rates at **3.50%–3.75%**, with markets focused on Chair Powell’s guidance after a collapse in consumer confidence to the weakest level since 2014 and a sharp slide in the dollar to a four‑year low (Reuters, NYT, Conference Board).
* US — President Trump’s attacks on the Fed and search for a more compliant chair are raising concern over central bank independence just as equity indices hover near record highs and futures point to modest tech-led gains (WSJ, NYT, Bloomberg).
* Global — Gold is holding above **$5,000/oz** and silver above **$110/oz**, while agricultural and soft‑commodity plays extend gains, signalling a broadening commodity bull phase and rising input‑cost risk into 2026 (Bloomberg, MarketWatch, Yahoo Finance).
* FX — The WSJ Dollar Index is near its lowest since early 2022 after the greenback’s worst one‑day drop since April 2025, prompting German regulator BaFin to warn that markets could begin questioning the dollar’s reserve status (WSJ, Reuters).
* Europe/Asia — German consumer sentiment is improving as income expectations rise, while Australia’s inflation hit **3.6%** (six‑quarter high), reinforcing expectations for an RBA hike next week and keeping global rate‑volatility elevated (CNBC, Bloomberg, Reuters).

**SPECULATIVE POSITIONING**

* Index options traders are heavily skewed to upside with a put/call volume ratio near **0.20** and put/call open interest near **0.18**, while tech absorbs the bulk of call premium – Stocknear options flow (27/01 data).
* Sector options budgets show Technology call spending above **$1.6B** versus far lower interest in Defensives, underscoring a crowded AI and mega‑cap growth bias even as hedging demand builds in rate‑ and crypto‑sensitive names – Stocknear sector flow.
* Fear & Greed sits at **64** (“greed”), consistent with sustained dip‑buying in US equities despite tariff, Fed and earnings headline risk – multi‑source sentiment composite.

MAG7 COVERAGE

* [NVDA](https://stocknear.com/stocks/NVDA) — Trades near **$188.52** (up **1.1%** yesterday) after a fresh **$2B** equity investment in CoreWeave and China’s approval of H200 AI‑chip imports; massive closing blocks (up to **$1.87B**) in dark pools signal continued institutional accumulation ahead of **25/02** earnings (Reuters, Benzinga, Stocknear dark‑pool).
* [AAPL](https://stocknear.com/stocks/AAPL) — Around **$258.27** (up **1.1%**) into tomorrow’s **29/01** print, with strong India iPhone share data and a looming Gemini‑powered Siri relaunch; big closing blocks and fresh buy‑ratings (e.g., JPM PT **$315**) highlight rotation rather than capitulation, but AI narrative risk remains elevated (Bloomberg, CNBC, Street research).
* [MSFT](https://stocknear.com/stocks/MSFT) — Trades near **$480.58** (up **2.2%**) ahead of tonight’s earnings as the new Maia 200 AI chip and aggressive data‑center buildout offset skepticism on near‑term AI monetization; large closing blocks and bullish options sentiment underline expectations for another cloud/AI beat (Reuters, Raymond James, Stocknear dark‑pool).
* [AMZN](https://stocknear.com/stocks/AMZN) — At **$244.68** (up **2.6%**) despite news of another \~**16k** job cuts and the shuttering of Fresh/Go stores, as investors focus on AWS AI growth and supercenter + same‑day grocery strategy into **05/02** earnings; repeated multi‑million‑share blocks point to dip‑buying by institutions (Reuters, CNBC, Stocknear dark‑pool).
* [GOOGL](https://stocknear.com/stocks/GOOGL) — Near **$334.55** (up \~**0.4%**) after a six‑month surge, as EU regulators push compliance on AI/data access and Google settles a **$68M** Assistant‑privacy case; options and dark‑pool flow show steady institutional buying but growing attention to lofty AI expectations ahead of **04/02** results (Reuters, WSJ, Stocknear flow).
* [META](https://stocknear.com/stocks/META) — Around **$672.97** (flat) into tonight’s earnings as the market weighs heavy 2026 capex for AI and data centers against strong ad momentum; a new multiyear fiber deal with Corning (up to **$6B**) and tests of paid AI subscriptions add optional upside, while large closing blocks suggest funds are leaning bullish on guidance (CNBC, WSJ, Stocknear dark‑pool).
* [TSLA](https://stocknear.com/stocks/TSLA) — Trades near **$430.91** (down \~**1%** yesterday) ahead of tonight’s Q4, with soft deliveries and brand‑value erosion offset by early unsupervised robotaxi tests in Austin and 2027 humanoid‑robot ambitions; block‑trade data show active but balanced positioning, with earnings seen as a high‑volatility AI/robotics inflection rather than a pure EV story (WSJ, Yahoo Finance, Stocknear dark‑pool).

As far as I know, I can only fail 2 subjects to pass to the next semester with a ""warunek"" (conditional pass/debt). This means I’d have to retake the classes next year, which is paid and expensive. But I have more than 2 failed subjects.
I even tried cheating on exams, but it didn't work. Sometimes I missed by 1 point. Other times, the questions on my phone didn't match the screen/board, or I had to type out long questions to get an answer, which was impossible.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

i also found out when we’re about two weeks into our shiny new townhouse - i spoke to him and he admitted it almost immediately and broke down - he says that he regretted it immediately but went back once again to see if he would feel anything different since he hated himself the first time. he has deep history with trauma which is unresolved and i’ve always encouraged him to therapy which he has ignored all these years. he says that sometimes he just doesn’t feel anything and needs to do something impulsive inorder to show himself that he can feel things and this is the worst way he did it.

for more context - we bought a house in the middle of bum fuck no where, and we both struggled a llooottttttt there! we were completely cut off from our friends as it was about 1 hour and 20 minutes away from the city where all of our support system was. i could feel that our relationship was getting strained, i personally felt stuck there and so did he - i was looking for new people to talk to just to get some excitement out of it cause the place had us both sucked in, however i never acted upon it! the house has both drained with so much going into it, renovation, maintenance and living so far out - we both felt like we’re just standing still and life was just passing by us. so when we finally left for india, it felt like our little paradise, our relationship felt like ours again - but when we came back, it was even worse than before because i hated being back and so did he. thats when we decided to rent out the house and move back to the city. and it was around november when he met this woman.

he’s begging me to stay and give him one chance to make this relationship work with a restart - he’s signed up for therapy and told me that he didn’t share his feelings or his triggers because he didn’t want me to worry as im someone that is always anxious. he said that he hated the way it felt when he was physical with the other person and he went back the second time to see if he could feel differently- also he was seeking for an ego boost or just anything - cause with his triggers he tends to not feel anything which scares him a lot. he says this is the relationship he’s prayed for all his life and that i am the love of his life.

i am so conflicted here - my first instinct is to run away, restart all over again by myself somewhere else and let time do its thing - but then i think about how deeply intertwined our lives are, we basically grew up together, our families are in love with us and they’re part of our lives, we have an end goal and we love the life we’ve built, how can i let it all go - i also understand why he did what he did even if that makes me sound stupid - but at the end i also question myself if i’m going to be a fool for staying - 10 years down the line will i look at myself and think that i was stupid to have stayed.

how can i move forward with this situation?",0,1769598537.0,relationship_advice,7,0.5,False

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

My husband, Zachariah Gilliatt, was set on making me pay. 

Everything I did was met with cold silence. 

At night, I’d make all kinds of noise–coughing violently for hours or getting up for water every few minutes–but he remained unresponsive. 

The master bedroom door stayed shut tight. 

He must have thought I was doing it on purpose to get his attention. 

But that wasn’t it. 

I was just in pain. After all, I was terminally ill. 

But he never would’ve believed me. 

To him, I was a born liar–incurably manipulative. 

Eventually, the doctors told me I had only one month left and that it was time to start planning my funeral. 

That day, Zachariah was leaning against the headboard, smoking, when I handed him the divorce papers. 

He scoffed. “You’ve tried every trick in the book, and now you’re pulling the divorce card to get my attention?” 

He refused to sign–he was still intent on tormenting me. 

He and I hadn’t married out of love. 

Back then, on the day the love of his life went abroad, he came to see me. 

“Since you’re so desperate to marry me, I’ll give you what you want,” he said. “But mark my words: marrying me will be the greatest regret of your life.” 

He was right–I did regret it. 

But it was too late. 

I handed him the diagnosis. 

“Let’s get a divorce. You wouldn’t want to be labeled a widower, would 

you?” 

He took the paper–the one that said I had one month left–and his hands began to shake. 

He jumped to his feet.

“Arianna Norcutt, you damn woman! Is this how you get back at me?” 

Panicking, he forcibly dragged me downstairs and shoved me into the car. 

“Heal her! I said, heal her!” he barked at the doctors. 

Was his heart actually breaking for me? 

But it was all far too late. 

\*\*\* 

That night, I ate dinner alone before heading to the bathroom. 

I stayed there for over an hour before coming out, wrapped in a bathrobe. 

I’d fallen asleep in the tub. 

Standing in front of the mirror, I tightened the robe’s tie and ran a finger over my sharp, gaunt chin. 

Any thinner, and I’d be nothing but skin and bones. 

Just then, the front door swung open. 

Zachariah came back, and he’d brought a girl with him. 

Our eyes met. 

The room went completely still. 

I clenched my hands inside my bathrobe sleeves. 

He leaned against the liquor cabinet, his lips curling into a sneer. “Look at you. What a turn–off.” 

In that moment, my heart clenched so tight I could barely breathe. 

I finally retreated to my bedroom and shut the door. 

Inside, I put on my headphones. 

But in the dark, the pain that had seeped into every cell of my body flared up again. 

I curled into a tight ball. 

Soon, the coppery taste of blood filled my throat. 

My lips parted, and blood gushed out, bright red in the lamplight. 

Drenched in cold sweat, I scrambled to my feet and staggered toward the bathroom. 

I lost track of how long I clenched my teeth against the searing pain that night. 

Only when it began to ease did I manage to haul myself up and wipe the blood I had coughed onto the floor.

Just then, the bathroom door shifted as someone pushed against it. 

I’d just turned on the faucet to wash my hands. 

“Is… someone in there?” the girl asked. 

I didn’t answer. I switched on the bathroom light instead. 

“Oh, so there is someone,” she muttered, sounding disappointed. 

A moment later, a figure leaned in the doorway. 

Two sharp knocks followed. 

“Are you done yet?” Zachariah asked. 

I ducked my head, scrubbing the blood from my hands faster. 

Then I pulled the door open and stepped out, brushing past him as he still leaned against the frame. 

The girl slipped into the bathroom behind me. 

Only then did I turn to look at him. 

Why? 

Why did he have to humiliate me like this? 

He just stared back. 

Was that a glint of triumph, satisfaction, or disdain in his eyes? 

I looked away. 

I poured a glass of hot water and set it on the coffee table. 

Then I bent to open the drawer and take out several medicine bottles. 

One by one, I shook the pills into my palm. 

He stayed where he was, watching me with a sneer. 

I set the medicines down and gave him a quiet look. 

What was that in his eyes? 

He must have thought I was faking again–pretending to be seriously ill just to get his attention. 

His expression said it all: “Arianna, go ahead with your little show. I’m not buying it.” 

I smiled. 

Gathering the pills, I lifted the glass and swallowed them.

Then I tidied the table and walked past him back to my room. 

When I was first diagnosed with leukemia, the doctor told me to bring a family member to the hospital. 

I called Zachariah, but he declined the call. 

I brought the medicine home and deliberately left it in the living room drawer instead of my bedroom. 

I thought he might one day open the drawer and find me dying. 

But half a year had passed, and he never noticed. 

Even though I had taken the pills right in front of him just now, he still assumed I was faking it. 

I shut the door behind me and almost laughed.

Just then, the bathroom door shifted as someone pushed against it. 

I’d just turned on the faucet to wash my hands. 

“Is… someone in there?” the girl asked. 

I didn’t answer. I switched on the bathroom light instead. 

“Oh, so there is someone,” she muttered, sounding disappointed. 

A moment later, a figure leaned in the doorway. 

Two sharp knocks followed. 

“Are you done yet?” Zachariah asked. 

I ducked my head, scrubbing the blood from my hands faster. 

Then I pulled the door open and stepped out, brushing past him as he still leaned against the frame. 

The girl slipped into the bathroom behind me. 

Only then did I turn to look at him. 

Why? 

Why did he have to humiliate me like this? 

He just stared back. 

Was that a glint of triumph, satisfaction, or disdain in his eyes? 

I looked away. 

I poured a glass of hot water and set it on the coffee table. 

Then I bent to open the drawer and take out several medicine bottles. 

One by one, I shook the pills into my palm. 

He stayed where he was, watching me with a sneer. 

I set the medicines down and gave him a quiet look. 

What was that in his eyes? 

He must have thought I was faking again–pretending to be seriously ill just to get his attention. 

His expression said it all: “Arianna, go ahead with your little show. I’m not buying it.” 

I smiled. 

Gathering the pills, I lifted the glass and swallowed them.

My husband, Zachariah Gilliatt, was set on making me pay. 

Everything I did was met with cold silence. 

At night, I’d make all kinds of noise–coughing violently for hours or getting up for water every few minutes–but he remained unresponsive. 

The master bedroom door stayed shut tight. 

He must have thought I was doing it on purpose to get his attention. 

But that wasn’t it. 

I was just in pain. After all, I was terminally ill. 

But he never would’ve believed me. 

To him, I was a born liar–incurably manipulative. 

Eventually, the doctors told me I had only one month left and that it was time to start planning my funeral. 

That day, Zachariah was leaning against the headboard, smoking, when I handed him the divorce papers. 

He scoffed. “You’ve tried every trick in the book, and now you’re pulling the divorce card to get my attention?” 

He refused to sign–he was still intent on tormenting me. 

He and I hadn’t married out of love. 

Back then, on the day the love of his life went abroad, he came to see me. 

“Since you’re so desperate to marry me, I’ll give you what you want,” he said. “But mark my words: marrying me will be the greatest regret of your life.” 

He was right–I did regret it. 

But it was too late. 

I handed him the diagnosis. 

“Let’s get a divorce. You wouldn’t want to be labeled a widower, would 

you?” 

He took the paper–the one that said I had one month left–and his hands began to shake. 

He jumped to his feet.

“Arianna Norcutt, you damn woman! Is this how you get back at me?” 

Panicking, he forcibly dragged me downstairs and shoved me into the car. 

“Heal her! I said, heal her!” he barked at the doctors. 

Was his heart actually breaking for me? 

But it was all far too late. 

\*\*\* 

That night, I ate dinner alone before heading to the bathroom. 

I stayed there for over an hour before coming out, wrapped in a bathrobe. 

I’d fallen asleep in the tub. 

Standing in front of the mirror, I tightened the robe’s tie and ran a finger over my sharp, gaunt chin. 

Any thinner, and I’d be nothing but skin and bones. 

Just then, the front door swung open. 

Zachariah came back, and he’d brought a girl with him. 

Our eyes met. 

The room went completely still. 

I clenched my hands inside my bathrobe sleeves. 

He leaned against the liquor cabinet, his lips curling into a sneer. “Look at you. What a turn–off.” 

In that moment, my heart clenched so tight I could barely breathe. 

I finally retreated to my bedroom and shut the door. 

Inside, I put on my headphones. 

But in the dark, the pain that had seeped into every cell of my body flared up again. 

I curled into a tight ball. 

Soon, the coppery taste of blood filled my throat. 

My lips parted, and blood gushed out, bright red in the lamplight. 

Drenched in cold sweat, I scrambled to my feet and staggered toward the bathroom. 

I lost track of how long I clenched my teeth against the searing pain that night. 

Only when it began to ease did I manage to haul myself up and wipe the blood I had coughed onto the floor.

1qp8eks,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismoTEA/comments/1qp8eks/do_not_seek_aim_of_human_civilization_because/,"do not seek aim of human civilization, because here that is","Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

read it complete. ( i promise only readers of this book that they { he/she } will get every single answer which they want to know about why im in this material world, who im, what will happen after this life, what is best thing which will make Human Life Perfect, and what is perfection of Human Life. ) purpose of human life is not to live like animal cuz every\`1 at present time doing 4 thing which are sleeping, eating, s.ex & fear. purpose of human life is to become freed from Birth after birth, Old Age, Disease, and Death.",1,1769598285.0,AutismoTEA,0,1.0,False

I’ve been losing two pounds per week and I’m almost back at my preferred weight. I just wanted to share them in case anyone might be like me and need a little boost.

1. Water, I drink my three liters every day.
2. Tea. Once a day, just a cup.
3. Lemon water first thing in the morning. Not scientifically proven or anything, but it makes me feel like I’m doing something.
4. Omelette: I’ve been having that for breakfast or the oatmeal. It’s my dinner too most days. Just three eggs with salt and pepper. I add a bit of tuna sometimes but it’s really

nice without it too.

1. Japanese cheesecake: my favorite snack these days. I always have a bit in the fridge in case I get hungry. I make the tiramisu version and I put coffee with the Greek yogurt. Good appetite suppressants.
2. Bananas and a bit of cinnamon are heavenly.

That’s basically all I’ve been eating lately. I know it sounds bland but it really taught me not to eat too much. I don’t count my calories anymore but it’s been pretty low, which explains the weight loss.

And to you reading this, you can do it. I’m the laziest girl in the whole world and I did it, so can you…

\- The sleep! I have been getting the quality sleep I was craving for so long and it is amazing! And even if one of my nights was not perfect (some asshole rang my bell late at night, my dog went berserk and barked like a psycho, leaving us both a bit rattled and the rest of my night was not so peaceful) - but still: I feel ok in the morning! A bit of bad sleep is nothing compared to bad sleep on alcohol and the hangover on the next day!

\- The food! I enjoy it much more, have time and energy to shop and cook delicious meals for myself, and fill up the void that all the extra calories from the alcohol left with snacks I never really enjoyed while drinking but love now! And still my weight is improving! At some point I will have to cut down the snacks a little, but for the first weeks I am cutting myself some slack, anything but booze can enter my body at the moment and it is ok.

\- My hair, my skin...I just look better simply

\- My performance and energy at work are way up, I really enjoy my job again

\- I have the energy to meet up with old and new friends for lunch, coffee, dinner, lunch, without giving any thought to the booze. I enjoy quality tea much more now.

\- I have time and energy to work out as I please. On my terms, no pressure, just when I feel like it. Sober me is overall kinder to myself and not a pushy self loathing bitch always trying to punish herself.

Overall I feel happy, relaxed, rested, motivated, social, proud..what a feeling and a contrast to drinking me (sad, depressed, insomniac, antisocial, lazy, self-loathing..)

Here is the breakdown.","I wanted to share a transparent update on my journey building a ""Quiet Tech"" ecosystem. I’m running two apps solo that solve opposite problems, and we just hit a major milestone today.

The Current Status (Jan 28):

App 1: DoMind (The ""Focus"" Engine)

* Value Prop: Offline-first productivity. No cloud sync, no data harvesting.
* Users: 625 (331 iOS / 294 Android).
* Retention: 4.77 sessions/day per user.
* Revenue: Just made my first $12 (organic). It’s coffee money, but it proves the ""Privacy Premium"" thesis people will pay to keep their data off the cloud.

 App 2: Moodie (The ""Emotion"" Engine)

* Value Prop: Anonymous connection based on Mood, not photos.
* Users: 1,600.
* The Win: Solved the ""Empty Room"" problem. Match times are now instant.
* Growth Hack: Implemented in-chat games (Tic-Tac-Toe/Dice). Retention skyrocketed because it killed the ""awkward silence.""

The ""Stack"" allowing me to manage both:

* Frontend: Flutter (Single codebase for iOS/Android).
* DoMind Backend: None (Local DB).
* Moodie Backend: Firebase (for real-time matching).

My takeaway so far:  
You don't need a massive marketing budget. You need a strong philosophy.

* DoMind grows because people are tired of complexity and need their life to be better even when offline...
* Moodie grows because people are lonely and tired of superficial swiping and doomscrolling...

Sixteen, hormones raging, my childhood sweetheart Caspian and I were home alone watching porn.

Next thing I knew, he was inside me—took my V-card right on the couch.

Both our parents walked in mid-thrust.

His dad beat him bloody, made him swear he'd marry me.

After that, we were Manhattan's golden couple.

But right before the wedding, he vanished on a cartel takedown in Colombia.

Two years I spent hunting him down.

Only to find him balls-deep in Jade, his rescue angel.

Caspian had lost all his memory.

But he married me anyway, kept that teenage promise.

Then came seven fucking years of hell.

He never touched me again. Separate rooms. Separate lives.

He even moved to Santa Fe and started rawing every girl in sight—his little revenge tour.

Until my dad got framed for fraud.

Caspian finally came back, cleared his name, took a poison blade meant for me.

Dying in my arms, he choked out:

""I never failed anyone in this life... except Jade. I owed her my life.""

""If there's a next life, don't look for me. Let me stay with Jade instead.""

I nodded through my tears. ""Okay.""

When I opened my eyes again, I was back to the day I found him.

Fuck that. Not this time.

Let him rot with his brainwashing slut.

This time, I chose Grayson Archer—the Delta Commander Caspian hated most.

""Dad, I'm DONE with Caspian. I'll accept that contract marriage!""

...

San Francisco Bay at night. Neon lights reflecting off the water.

Mrs. Blackwood was crying happy tears beside me.

""Caspian's really here?""

""Yes, ma'am. That Jade girl pulled him out from the docks. They've been living in this walk-up ever since.""

""I'm going up.""

I snapped back to reality.

The building was falling apart—exposed wires crawling over the walls, a tacky wedding sign on the window, daring me to look away.

The same damn place Caspian kept mumbling about when he was dying.

I grabbed Mrs. Blackwood's arm. 

""Wait.""

She turned. ""Scarlett, what's wrong?""

Last time around, by the time I tracked him here, Caspian was already in love with that coffee shop bitch, ready to marry her.

I tried talking to him multiple times, but he refused to leave.

So I brought Mrs. Blackwood and a top neurologist to force his hand.

That night—tonight, originally—seeing his mother finally made him agree to hypnotherapy.

Next day, his memory came back. He agreed to come home.

And the second we left, Jade overdosed, killed herself.

Her death became the wall between us. 

Caspian died protecting me, but his dying wish was to rewind and stay with her instead.

I swallowed the pain. 

""Mrs. Blackwood, they're about to get married.""

She patted my hand. 

""Sweetheart, Caspian just lost his memory. Once he remembers, he'll know who really matters.""

""You two grew up together. Twenty years. We all saw it.""

I stepped back. ""There's something I never told you. Maybe this is a sign.""

""I... my uterus is damaged. I can't have kids anymore.""

Silence. 

Just the distant sound of a ferry horn.

Mrs. Blackwood went pale. Her lips trembled. 

""You're young. Medicine these days—""

""The best doctors already confirmed it.""

Two years hunting Caspian across war zones and cartel territory wrecked my body. 

I ignored every warning sign.

By the time we wanted kids, it was too late. 

Doctors said my chances were almost zero.

After a long silence, she sighed deeply. 

""Even so, the Blackwoods won't abandon you. Caspian wouldn't care.""

I bowed slightly. 

""My mom died young. You treated me like your own daughter.""

""I can't repay that kindness by ending your family line.""

In the original timeline, even after Caspian got his memory back, he blamed Mrs. Blackwood and me for Jade's death. 

He shut us out completely, lived alone in Santa Fe.

I lost my husband. Mrs. Blackwood lost her son.

Mrs. Blackwood exhaled heavily. 

""Fine. We won't disturb him tonight. We'll talk later.""

Back home, she brought in her private medical team. They confirmed everything I said.

The lead doctor hesitated. 

""With years of careful treatment, maybe there's a slim chance. But... no guarantees.""

I returned the engagement token—a ring with an encrypted chip inside. 

""My fate with the Blackwoods is over.""

""Since Caspian doesn't remember anyway, let's just... let it be. Everyone moves on.""

1qp8bua,https://www.reddit.com/r/Semenretention/comments/1qp8bua/kundaliniphantom_psychological_orgasm/,Kundalini/phantom psychological orgasm,"3 weeks ago broke a 4+ days water fast but ate soup with too much ingredients and also had small amount of sheep kifer with berries. On that same day went to Meditation at night had unusual experience was seeing strange creatures and some look like demons. Following day morning started getting refeeding syndrome symptoms, so right away I knew was the food I hate. Did not panic or called 911 instead tried to correct it  at home. Managed to get electrolytes back to balance and nervous system seemed to stable. Been having only vegetables and fruits alkaline diet

Fast forward now: past 2 days during last 2 Meditations started feeling some symptoms of Kundalini such as pressure, tingling on my forehead, twitching, body vibrating, pressure on back and my neck that's as far as it went.

Yesterday after the meditation went to sleep, had a wet dream ejaculated but when I woke up nothing came out no seamen only felt the need to go pee.

Does anyone know is this normal, and does the dream have negative impact on Kundalini and seamen retention?

Also had this dreams few days prior:

Had a dream where my guides came to me. One as an gentle elderly lady asking me: ""what are you waiting for?"" and followed by another as a big tall policeman asked me: ""what to want to be""?

I did not know what to say to the lady, so I think I lied and said I was waiting for my daughter to get off work she replied sometimes it takes time for her to get of work then she lefta cup of coffee with a paper underneath it and l walked away. Tho I was feeling lost and was waiting for clear guidance and for someone to help me get where I need to be. 

To the policeman I said I don't know. He told me you need to know.

But I don't know, I just know that  this isn't it.

The interesting aspect I noticed was that: I was clearly an adult in the dream I I'AM in in physical realm be to my guides felt looked like I was a young boy needing guidance seen myself as a kid and an adult simultaneously.

The man could be severus after the war and Lily found out that he changed sides. But he never truly appeared in front of her because albus said that he changed for her.... yet why isn't he trying to visit her? Albus told her he never asked him to pay her a visit. Albus also tells her that he assumes that Severus knew his position within Lily's life. Back then, she told Severus to never bother her and he doesn't.

Lily on the other hand is dealing with a husband, who only seems to be into his husbandly duties in bed, but outside bed, it stops. She deals with the divorce and seeks shelter in Hogwarts as a teacher, where Severus happened to work. It wasn't her as her, she had a different identity.

Seeing how Severus was from afar. Uninterested in everyone.... as usual. As guilty as she should've felt, it made her smile, he hasn't truly changed. Severus catches her glances. Feeling far from honored to have a pretty woman's glances on him. It was visible even for others.

He used to eat at least with other teachers, but after her arrival he completely stopped. Lily too isn't ready for anything new. Not after that insufferable being of a man and her child's safety in this war. She hears snippets of her friends communicating with her through letters. None have died yet, luckily. Dumbledore assures her that things played out better than he anticipated.

Somehow she feels like it's Severus his fault that the war seems to be looking good on their side. Every secret meeting those two had, she caught. Wondering if she would've fought just as greatly by their side. Her student taps on her shoulder. 'Miss Raphens, do you have a boyfriend?'

Kids these days. What is she even thinking about. Marlene told Minerva once to go out there and explore a bit. Her generation wasn't anything better. 'That is luckily none of your business, Nina.'

The kids were a bit hard to keep an eye on. She remembers how awfully rowdy her muggle classes were as a child. Magical children are even worse to keep an eye on due to their magic, and sneaky uses of hexes and jinxes. Everyday, at least 1 kid ends up in Pomfrey's room. The door opens to Albus his room. Severus his mood was foul. Looking as if there is a heavy storm up ahead and he's the sailor on a rickety boat.

Severus stands outside. He promised not to smoke too often. Why did Albus tell him about Lily? As long as she's alive, he'll do anything to keep her alive. If the child lives, bonus points for those. Now he told Snape about the divorce and a 2nd hidden address. He had to promise Albus to cooperate with potions making for Lupin, to *not* tell Severus about Lily's hidden location.

Because, what if the lord suddenly began to look into memories and he would be the cause to kill her and her family? He feels like this all was just a trap to have him prepare those wolfsbane potions. Trap, not a trap, hes exhausted trying to figure out what that old coot is thinking about. Certainly thinking about things in front of him. Unlike Tom, he isn't too prideful to use legilimency spell.

*'You disgust me'* he remembers that. He was and remains disgusting. Severus does wonder if Lily and Harry are at least doing alright. As revolting as James was, he was a wand user and 2 wands are better than 1. Were they fed enough? They should keep themselves warm. This winter seems colder than the previous ones.

He goes to the teachers dormroom and finds the woman with her baby. 'Oh, I-I'm sorry.'

'No, its alright.' He tries to find his key to his room but she asked him the question he dreaded he'd hear.

'Could you help me with my son?'

Why? Why him? He nods and holds the infant. He held him awkwardly and far from him. Frowning at Raphens for laughing at him. She shows him how to hold the infant. Letting them in her room. She saw it on his face. Judging her for a messy room. But he never spoke it out loud. Lily puts him on a chair as she cleans the room. The boy stops crying 'I should clean the room. You hold the baby.'

'No, its alright. I need to move around a bit.'

'It's your baby.' It rubs her the wrong way. James said that once. That man had no reason unlike Severus.

She sighs. Why should she be stuck like this? A clump is caught up in her throat. Hiding her trembling bottom lip by biting on it. 'You're right. I'm sorry for the mess.'

'It's alright. I've seen worse.' Right, severus grew up on *that* side of the town. She reaches out for Harry, getting fussy again. Snape got on his knees to pick up stuff from the floor.

'No!' Startling everyone, including herself at the raise of her voice.

She clears her throat 'I mean No. You don't have to do that.'

'I don't know your reason. But I can help you with the housework at least as you keep your infant busy. It's not much.' It wasn't in his eyes. As soon as the objects were removed from the floor, he used magic to do the rest.

Lily watches him willingly get his hands dirty. Rolling up his sleeve. He didn't have much hair on his arm and one arm glistened with magic. She know that that is the arm with that dark mark. Severus left and entered back again with food he prepared in his own house. 'Have a nice evening miss Raphens.' And he slams the door behind him.

He always slams doors quietly. As a child, as a teen and now as an adult. Rapidly closing the door, but right before it hits, softening the blow. She sits down. Harry tugging at her shirt as she eats. He brought her a piece of pie even. Just like how her mom made it. Reminding her of the countless times they stood in her mom's kitchen and taught the girls how to cook. While she and her sister whined about it, wiggled themselves out of those lessons, severus was there by her side.

Harry drools all over her chest. Eyes wide and focused on that pear pie. She gave him a tiny bit and he began to kick and swing his arms and legs everywhere. Dropping the dessert. 'Ugh.' He began to cry again as she tries to hold it together. She wanted to eat it too. She puts him in the crib. People told her that you cannot pick kids up at their every whim. Sometimes you need to let them cry it out. She doesn't believe those, but now it seems perfect to follow that advice.

She does. She goes in the shower and lets Harry cry. But as soon as he started to get choked up on his own saliva. She ran out and took him in bath with her. Wiping his tears. Soothing him with nothing. He didnt want to eat, bathe, sleep or had a dirty nappy. 'Stop it' she whisper yells. Repeating it again. The fog, the warmth, the headaches are getting to her. Harry's ear bleeding cries weren't exactly soothing.

Why did they lie? Why did they talk about motherhood being amazing? All she wishes for is a maid to take him away when it gets too much. She puts on her bathrobe, when someone knocks. 'Snape, what beings you here.'

'I hear the infant cry.'

'Sorry about that. They happen to do that, you know?' She answers dryly. Its not her fault the boy isn't a quiet baby.

Amused by her directive answer 'No. Is there something i could help with?'

'Why would you want to help?'

He's quiet and she thought of every answer he could've said. Every joke he could've made. Every petty answer he could've given. Every smug answer that could've stroked his ego. 'My mom was a single mom. It's a tough job. I dont know about your relationship but if it eases the burden a little. I can help.'

He could always help. Be it house tasks, like cleaning, grocery shopping and cooking to tending his mother's wounds. He lied. But his mom might as well have been a single mom. That gaze in her eyes that displayed eternal love but also, the eternal dreams that stopped being eternal. It was difficult to explain. 'Do you have some of that pie? He seems to cry for it.'

She smiles when he gave that small nod and hurried to his room and coming back with the whole platter. He allowed her to eat the whole thing as he fed the boy tiny bits in his baby chair. Followed by some warm milk and the bed time. Without so much as a lingering gaze, seductive smile, he left. Lily falls asleep on her bed. Wondering if he would've acted differently if she was herself. Would he flirt with her?

Severus eventually became part of their lives. He doesn't smile too much. Whenever he has to hold him, he spoke about how he can't handle infants. It wasn't truly to avoid tasks but she knew Severus. She knows him now. He didn't trust himself. Even told it herself. About a relationship he broke. Nor would he wish to get too close to the two of them. Using her ex as an excuse. In case the ex came back, he didn't want the boy to get confused by another man in his life.

At night, she holds a conversation with severus. Not as miss Diana Raphens but as Lily Evans. It is always revolving around important conversations she forgot about. Like how they laid on that grass one day and he spoke about how his dad didn't like anything. Or about his mom allowing him to wear such clothing. Severus back then responds kindly to her. Asking if she's alright. Asking if she wants some alone time and take the baby off of her hand.

She doesn't want Harry gone, god forbid. But... Just some alone time. Little Severus would cry with her. Severus sits on the chair across her bed. He bought the chamomile tea she wished for. Taken back by her tears. He wipes them away. 'Men are pigs' he murmurs. Something he hears all his life. His mom and women in his neighbourhood. Muggle women and witches face the same kind of poorly raised men.

He wanted to tell her that he'll be gone. He'll be gone for a long while. Albus said so. Lily blinks her eyes open. Long enough to watch Snape write on a letter. 'What's wrong?'

Harry was quietly watching from his crib, sitting upright. 'I preferred you'd read this after I'm gone.'

'Gone where?' She snatches the letter and quickly reads it.

'Why do you have to leave?' She holds him by the shoulders. His scent, his ashy flowery scent is now more memorable than ever.

'I have to. I can't say why.' He tries to pry her off of him.

'Is... is it Albus?' He can't leave. Who will help her? Who will... Who will look at her?

Severus has an unique kindness reflected in his eyes. Wiping her tears away. 'Miss Diana. Just focus on yourself, your child and your relationship. Your husband might return and this isn't exact-'

'Fuck him! I am not his property! He should've contacted me then if he cared about me.' He did. James did. James apologised but it sounds like the same shitty excuse he did before that, and before that, and before that.

'I'm sorry, I'm sorry.' Snape hisses when her nails dug in his skin.

'Sorry doesn't mean anything, Severus!' She cries.

'I need you, Dean needs you.' She presses her head against his chest. Hoping he'd soothe her.

'I'm saying sorry, because i think you need to find a new nanny, Diana. I might not make it back.'

She shook her head softly 'No, no, no, no'

He tries to pull her away. 'You treat me like this because you dont know me! I'm -----'

She touches her throat. Why was it peeped out? Right, she swore to not reveal her identity. She tries again but it only confuses Severus. He had to go out there. For Lily's safety. In the back of his mind, he also knows for Diana and Dean their safety. The change happened for the better. Albus appears in the door way and extends a hand to Severus to take. Lily pulls onto the man's jacket to not take that hand. But he did. Severus tells Albus to look after them properly before he sets out on the mission.

\------

Severus returns. Avoiding Diana once again. He didnt know if she even wanted him near her. Lily doesn't approach him either. Maybe it was for the best. It isn't his fault. When Harry cries again for a minute too long. He knocks on her door. Leaving the pie at her door and is gone. She slips a letter under his door. Allowing him to come over.

Lily wakes up the next morning with breakfast on the table and Harry in a new change of clothing. He told her he's going out for a smoke and has to grade papers. She gives permission to do those things in her room too. Over the days, it felt like they returned back to their old lives.

As Severus Snape and Lily Evans. Nothing more, nothing less. Whispering about stupid answers that students wrote. And the war does end.... eventually. Tjings return to how they were. She expected Severus Snape to perhaps pay the real her a visit but he doesn't. James asks why she changed. Why she won't look the same way at him like back then anymore. She can't and won't. Sev was right. It would be messy when they returned. Harry isn't even comfortable in James his arms.

Unable to hold a toddler properly, telling him that he cries too much, or taking away the dolls. 'Did you involve another man?'

'I did, but not sexually or romantically. I was struggling with Harry in the new environment. And he helped me. That's it.'

James sucked his cheek inside 'As long as you didn't let him shag you.'

'We were on a break. So what if I did?'

'I let my wife go a few months and she already goes to fuck another bloke. Maybe, Pads was right.'

Lily didn't smell the booze. She crawled out of the bed. Petrified of the man screaming at her face. She didn't sleep around but she wonders that if Severus did show signs first, would she? James is horrible. Horrible as a husband and as a father. She crawls on the floor next to Harry. Wrapping herself in blankets. 'Lily, I love you. You k-'

'I am sorry, James. I have fallen for another. Perhaps the one that I was mean to be with in the first place.' Severus hasn't changed but now he seems so *perfect*.

At the meeting, the announcement was made of the fallen heroes. Amongst them she hears the name 'Severus Snape'

She's quiet. Her eyes widened a little. Her throat felt dry. At home, she looks at Harry and sees her fingers tremble, reaching out for him. Hiding her face in the boy's torso. His clothes getting more damp with her tears. Her silent sobbing alarming James, entering the house later. 'Lily, let him go.'

'I am not hurting my child.'

'Still, our child should play.'

'He's mine, James. You made it very clear.'

'Let's not do this... and I was drunk.'

'You do absolutely nothing the whole day, I immediately get busy right after giving birth and then have the gall to get drunk and tell me bollocks. Seems fair.'

James rolls his eyes 'Are you... are you on your period? Remus said that like Lycans, women tend to be aggressive once a month too.'

'I am going to leave, James.' She just decided that. This was honestly too much. Compared to this, her job at hogwarts didn't seem too bad. Within a week, she left. Her parents helped her as well as his parents as long as they could see their grandchild. Harry was allowed to spend the weekends at his dad's house as and if hes older week after week.

\-----------

Lily put her stuff down in her old room. Harry is there in his crib, chewing on his green dragon plush toy and princess randomly in one hand while the knight ragdoll was on the other end of his fierce gaze. The door opens but an entirely new man stood there. 'Can I help you?'

'No, sorry. I apologize. I thought you were someone else.' He quickly left after seeing her. As if frightened by her presence alone. She huffs and begins to clean the place. Apparently that new guy moved into severus his room. He's quiet. Extremely quiet but just as strict towards students. Why does she feel like she is staring often at the other person? First Severus and now this Alain Dylano. And again, the other guy is avoiding her eyes.

James wouldn't, he'd try to win her attention and look at how that turned out. He compares her period and assumed yet shitty traits of a woman, the one trait that gave him a child to that poor disease lycans suffer from. She sees Remus smiling at Alain 'You smell the same'.

'Stop tracking me like a dog dying to find a mate.'

'Who says im not?'

Alain hisses 'For someone supposed to be shy, you sure know your way with words.' Remus shrugs, he was in a group full of casanovas. James won competition, sirius was born that way, peter studied how to be like them and he picked up a thing or two from them.

Alain nearly slams his door but softened the blow right beforehand. Lily found it strange. Was Alain perhaps a friend of Lupin, maybe Snape too? They act alike. In the weekend she took the form of Diana Raphens. There was no real reason. She walks with Harry a little by the quidditch stands. 'Diana? Diana, is that you?'

Sounds like Alain, but why would he recognise Diana? 'Yes?'

'It's me, Severus.'

'What? '

Alain smiles 'I know this is strange. But I had bad people after me. And... people despise me. Some for good reasons and some for petty ones. They wouldn't like to see me near them. I had to act as if I died.'

'Why? Who even hates you that much?'

'I dont know if its still that way. But there was this prophecy. A family destined to die. Two were chosen. One of the two had my friend from the past, and the other some asshole that made my life miserable. I had a fight with my friend and she wished to never see me again.' He spoke about it like he explained the sky. Distant, obvious and unattached.

'I could be myself if we are together if you wish. I can still help you all you want.'

Lily didn't know she had this much of an impact on that poor boy's life. The boy of back then. To think people would throw away their lives for love. She would for Harry. But Snape was a friend of that past. 'Severus.... its me, lily. I was hiding in Hogwarts with Harry.'

'I.... am. No. It's not true.'

'Don't you recognise Harry?'

'He's barely two, all toddlers look the same.'

She snorts 'I dont hate you.' She grabs his sleeve.

He frees himself 'I am sorry, Lily. I didnt mean to do any of those things.'

'It's all in the past now, Sev. We can be together.'

'No, its... I don't see you that way. I needed Diana.'

'But she's me! I am Diana Raphens. You like me, Severus. Admit it... i won't mind it. I won't. I promise I won't.'

'But... you and Potter.'

'Screw him.' She pulls him and kisses him. Feeling his uncooperative nature.

'Be a man, Severus.' She puts her hand on her mouth. Witnessing the hurt in his eyes. His big black eyes. Like saucers. James acted like a man, thats what she ran away from.

'Lily, this is just wrong. I-'

'Harry likes your pear pie. Look, he even is happy to see you.' She lifts the boy and it melts her heart to see him happy with the boy too. They are perfect together.

He allows Harry to hold his finger. Lily leans her head against his arm. That smokey flowery scent again. Severus led them up to his room with soup and pumpkin pie waiting. 'It's not a pear pie but I hope it is something.'

Barely done with his sentence and Harry began to make grabby hands to the pie. Snape chuckles. Slicing him a tiny bit. 'I didnt have a choice to be Diana.' She leans over the counter.

'I know.'

'And you were... a wonderful experience.'

Another knock on his door. Lupin showed himself inside. Glancing between Snape and Lily. She stood upright all of a sudden. She could sense it. He saw her as competition.... for Severus? But he likes her. He isn't gay. 'Lupin.'

'Severus, you made a delicious meal.'

'Help yourself.' Remus did. Made Lily also a plate. Harry was bribed for some little soup then pie. The two look at Alain.

'I cant believe Dumbledore allowd you to play death.'

'Why? There is nobody that would mourn me but there are people who want my flesh pierced with an unforgivable.' He stated matter of factly.

'Dumbledore helped me a lot.' He adds.

'Why would you even think nobody would care?'

Severus looks up from his mug of black coffee. 'I don't exactly have friends, nor family to search for me.' His parents died, his friends saw him as useful and malfoys were more or less in it for the skills then blossomed to a friendship after but they have worse things to tend to as for now. There isn't much to go on.

'I do care. I mourned you, Severus.'

'I'm sorry about that then, Evans. It was what I wanted. I didn't want to bring Diana into my mess. I wanted to at least be honest with her.' Disappearing so often wasn't ideal.

Remus rests his elbows on his thighs. Leaning forward. 'Severus, I love you.'

'You dont' Lily snaps. He cant.

'Severus isn't gay.' He loves her..... he remembers.

Snape frowns 'I dont even like you, Lupin. We couldn't stand ea-'

'I was 15, we were just 15. I changed.'

'We are colleagues. We should act like that and be proper. I'm sorry Lily but I didn't love Diana that way. It was... i saw you needed the help and I offered. I adored the time I spent with you and Dean. I mean Harry.'

'I get it, sev. I get it. I do like you though. We can be friends. Best friends like back then.'

'It's best we don't. We can be colleagues. It's ideal you two are here actually. Our pasts wasnt quite ideal-'

Lily blurts 'We were just ki-'

'I know we were just kids! But it doesn't soften the pain. I was pushed in the corner so many times by that guy and his friends. You treated my problems like they were a chore! You both made your choice. Stick to it.'

'You didn't stick to yours. Why cant I change my choice too... for you, for us?' Remus holds him closer to him. Hugging the shivering frame against his chest. Lily hugs him too.

'Because I changed to not let my friend die. You changed for convenience. It's not strange that the woman whose child i treat well suddenly wants me back in her life and the man whose potions I brew wants that too.' Lily laughs. It sounds like her friend. It truly sounds like the sketchy him.

Severus shakes them off to change in the bathroom and appears as himself. Remus mouths to Lily that he will have him. Lily didn't want to pressure severus more but she does want him to herself.

**PS**

**I wanted snily but it led me to a cheap knock off of weredoes. I don't know why, the characters gave me this story**

**Also .**  
**I hope I don't offend anyone with this.**

**I live a bit realism seeping into fantasy. I cant deny that. I also write such fanfics. I know Harry Potter is magical and such. But I want as much realism I could accept to be woven into my own storylines. Such as the high chance that tobias was Christian, that Eileen couldn't cook, etc. So take what I wrote hopefully not wrong and I didn't truly investigate if its true. So its from what I imagine.**

**I was thinking while writing this writing prompt.**

**But, in this writing prompt, Remus is gay but chalks up a woman's period as being the agression month. Insensitive thibg to say now. But I feel like even if you are gay back then, a gay man would still be unknowledgeable or insensitive about the woman's body. And by back then I mean someone born in the 60's and raised in England.**

**My second idea is that Lily in here refuses to believe Severus is gay. Doesn't see Remus as competition and even if he did choose Remus, she'd be bitter about it and perhaps become a woman scarred by homosexuals for having her ideal man stolen from her. Emphasis on the perhaps.**

On that same day went to Meditation at night had unusual experience was seeing strange creatures and some look like demons. Following day morning started getting refeeding syndrome symptoms, so right away I knew was the food I hate. Did not panic or called 911 instead tried to correct it  at home. Managed to get electrolytes back to balance and nervous system seemed to stable. Been having only vegetables and fruits alkaline diet

Fast forward now: past 2 days during last 2 Meditations started feeling some symptoms of Kundalini such as pressure, tingling on my forehead, twitching, body vibrating, pressure on back and my neck that's as far as it went.

Yesterday after the meditation went to sleep, had a wet dream ejaculated but when I woke up nothing came out no seamen only felt the need to go pee.

Does anyone know is this normal, and does the dream have negative impact on Kundalini and seamen retention?

Also had this dreams few days prior:

Had a dream where my guides came to me. One as an gentle elderly lady asking me: ""what are you waiting for?"" and followed by another as a big tall policeman asked me: ""what to want to be""?

I did not know what to say to the lady, so I think I lied and said I was waiting for my daughter to get off work she replied sometimes it takes time for her to get of work then she lefta cup of coffee with a paper underneath it and l walked away. Tho I was feeling lost and was waiting for clear guidance and for someone to help me get where I need to be. 

To the policeman I said I don't know. He told me you need to know.

But I don't know, I just know that  this isn't it.

The interesting aspect I noticed was that: I was clearly an adult in the dream I I'AM in in physical realm be to my guides felt looked like I was a young boy needing guidance seen myself as a kid and an adult simultaneously.

Some nights my baby sleeps like an angel—I actually get a few hours of solid sleep, and I feel like I can finally breathe.

The next night? Total chaos. Waking every 45 minutes, crying, feeding, diaper changes… I’m starting to think my baby has a secret vendetta against sleep.

And the naps… oh my god, the naps. Some days they go perfectly at the “right” time, other days, 10 minutes here, 15 minutes there, nothing predictable. It’s impossible to plan anything—showering, meals, errands… even a quick coffee feels like a mission impossible.

I’ve tried routines, dim lights, white noise, even bribing with toys… sometimes it works, sometimes it’s like the universe is mocking me.

Some days I laugh, some days I cry, some days I do both at the same time.

I’m curious—does anyone else actually go through this kind of chaos? Are your babies’ sleep patterns this unpredictable too, or is it just me?",1,1769597791.0,AttachmentParenting,0,1.0,False

i also found out when we’re about two weeks into our shiny new townhouse - i spoke to him and he admitted it almost immediately and broke down - he says that he regretted it immediately but went back once again to see if he would feel anything different since he hated himself the first time. he has deep history with trauma which is unresolved and i’ve always encouraged him to therapy which he has ignored all these years. he says that sometimes he just doesn’t feel anything and needs to do something impulsive inorder to show himself that he can feel things and this is the worst way he did it.

for more context - we bought a house in the middle of bum fuck no where, and we both struggled a llooottttttt there! we were completely cut off from our friends as it was about 1 hour and 20 minutes away from the city where all of our support system was. i could feel that our relationship was getting strained, i personally felt stuck there and so did he - i was looking for new people to talk to just to get some excitement out of it cause the place had us both sucked in, however i never acted upon it! the house has both drained with so much going into it, renovation, maintenance and living so far out - we both felt like we’re just standing still and life was just passing by us. so when we finally left for india, it felt like our little paradise, our relationship felt like ours again - but when we came back, it was even worse than before because i hated being back and so did he. thats when we decided to rent out the house and move back to the city. and it was around november when he met this woman.

he’s begging me to stay and give him one chance to make this relationship work with a restart - he’s signed up for therapy and told me that he didn’t share his feelings or his triggers because he didn’t want me to worry as im someone that is always anxious. he said that he hated the way it felt when he was physical with the other person and he went back the second time to see if he could feel differently- also he was seeking for an ego boost or just anything - cause with his triggers he tends to not feel anything which scares him a lot. he says this is the relationship he’s prayed for all his life and that i am the love of his life.

i am so conflicted here - my first instinct is to run away, restart all over again by myself somewhere else and let time do its thing - but then i think about how deeply intertwined our lives are, we basically grew up together, our families are in love with us and they’re part of our lives, we have an end goal and we love the life we’ve built, how can i let it all go - i also understand why he did what he did even if that makes me sound stupid - but at the end i also question myself if i’m going to be a fool for staying - 10 years down the line will i look at myself and think that i was stupid to have stayed.",1,1769597741.0,u_cabbagegirlhere,0,1.0,False

I work IT for a company where ""please don’t leak our stuff"" isn’t just a guideline, it’s practically a lifestyle. You’d think this would be intuitive. You’d think people would maybe ask before bringing in gadgets that can livestream the entire building to Meta’s servers. You would be wrong.

I’m sitting at my desk, sipping my first coffee, pretending today will be normal, because hope is a disease... when Security calls me. Not emails, not messages. Calls. That’s already a red flag because the only time they call is when someone tries to badge in using a frozen lasagna or something equally cursed.
""Uh, can you come to reception? We… have a situation.""

Great. Love that. Nothing ever begins with ""situation"" and ends with ""and then everyone got cookies.""

I head down, and there’s an employee standing there like they’re about to board the Starship Enterprise. Backpack, badge, smile, and the most innocent-looking pair of Ray-Ban glasses I’ve ever seen. Except these are not innocent. These are smart glasses. As in: camera, microphone, AI assistant, cloud upload, easily mistaken for spy gear smart glasses.

Security looks at me with the expression of someone who has accidentally activated a bomb.
""Are these… allowed?""

Now here’s the fun part: we don’t have a policy for this. At all. Zero. Nobody thought to write ""don’t wear personal surveillance devices into the building,"" because apparently that would have been too obvious. So now it’s up to me, the IT guy who once had to explain what a GIF is to an executive, to make a spur of the moment compliance ruling on whether a pair of sunglasses is a tool of industrial espionage.

I ask the employee, as politely as possible, if their glasses record.

""Oh yeah!"" they say proudly. ""They do video, audio, photos, voice commands… basically everything!""

Cool cool cool cool cool.

Just what I needed before 10 AM.

Totally normal workplace thing.

Security’s eyes widen like the glasses have started counting down from 10.

So now begins the Grand Corporate Panic. Security is flipping through internal SOPs like they’re trying to summon a policy from sheer force of will. HR is pinging me asking if this falls under the wearables guideline (it does not). Compliance is in a meeting because compliance is always in a meeting. Legal is unreachable because apparently the universe hates me.

Meanwhile the employee is just vibing. Rocking their CIA cosplay. Probably wondering why half the building suddenly looks like they’re participating in a hostage negotiation.

After ten minutes of chaos and at least one person Googling ""Ray-Ban smart glasses security risks corporate environment,"" the consensus becomes:
We have no idea what we’re doing, therefore the answer is probably NO.

So I ask the employee if they have normal, non-panopticon glasses they can switch to.

Miraculously, they do.

They swap eyewear, Security sighs like they just disarmed a bomb, and the employee walks in like nothing happened while the rest of us collectively reboot our brains.

Crisis over… right?

Wrong.

Because two hours later, we receive an official ticket:

""Hi Team,
We recently encountered a situation involving connected glasses (Ray-Ban model). We were unsure which guideline applies. As a precaution, we asked the employee to switch to non-connected glasses, which was fortunately possible. Could you please advise if connected glasses are allowed on our premises?""

Translation: We panicked and now we want IT to invent a rule so we don’t panic again.

We have a Legal department. 4 counsels.

So the ticket was closed and HR informed that IT cannot advise in this case, and they should be liaising with Legal. But I’m sitting here crafting the most professional follow-up response possible while my brain is screaming:

We didn’t have a policy because no one expected people to walk in wearing Facebook FaceCams on a Tuesday morning, Karen.

We will absolutely have a policy next week, though. Nothing motivates corporate rule-making like the sudden fear of being involuntarily livestreamed from the coffee machine.

TL;DR:

Employee shows up wearing Ray-Ban smart glasses.

Security freaks out.

HR freaks out.

IT freaks out.

Nobody knows what the policy is because the policy doesn’t exist.

We tell the employee to please stop being a wearable GDPR violation.

They switch to normal glasses.

Basically I had this ambition to be a photographer, to make money as one shooting portraits and models for magazines etc, but since going deep into a celibate life i've realised that industry is very lustful, very objective views on beauty very ego centric (and you realise when contacting models that a lot are doing OF and stuff like that on the side) I could feel myself slipping back into old lustful thoughts and my energy being 'sucked'. 

Now I'm focused on God, Art, reading esoteric books, getting healthier and playing guitar all of which seem to come from the 'real me' not the ego self that I thought I was. 

Perhaps I would like to become a counsellor of some sort to help others and I also like talking to people.

1qp81gm,https://www.reddit.com/r/awakened/comments/1qp81gm/kundaliniphantom_psychological_orgasm/,Kundalini/phantom psychological orgasm,"3 weeks ago broke a 4+ days water fast but ate soup with too much ingredients and also had small amount of sheep kifer with berries. On that same day went to Meditation at night had unusual experience was seeing strange creatures and some look like demons. Following day morning started getting refeeding syndrome symptoms, so right away I knew was the food I hate. Did not panic or called 911 instead tried to correct it  at home. Managed to get electrolytes back to balance and nervous system seemed to stable. Been having only vegetables and fruits alkaline diet

Fast forward now: past 2 days during last 2 Meditations started feeling some symptoms of Kundalini such as pressure, tingling on my forehead, twitching, body vibrating, pressure on back and my neck that's as far as it went.

Yesterday after the meditation went to sleep, had a wet dream ejaculated but when I woke up nothing came out no seamen only felt the need to go pee.

Does anyone know is this normal, and does the dream have negative impact on Kundalini and seamen retention?

Also had this dreams few days prior:

Had a dream where my guides came to me. One as an gentle elderly lady asking me: ""what are you waiting for?"" and followed by another as a big tall policeman asked me: ""what to want to be""?

I did not know what to say to the lady, so I think I lied and said I was waiting for my daughter to get off work she replied sometimes it takes time for her to get of work then she lefta cup of coffee with a paper underneath it and l walked away. Tho I was feeling lost and was waiting for clear guidance and for someone to help me get where I need to be. 

To the policeman I said I don't know. He told me you need to know.

But I don't know, I just know that  this isn't it.

The interesting aspect I noticed was that: I was clearly an adult in the dream I I'AM in in physical realm be to my guides felt looked like I was a young boy needing guidance seen myself as a kid and an adult simultaneously.

1qp80oc,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1qp80oc/first_day_on_vyvanse_diary_of_an_anxious_person/,First day on Vyvanse- diary of an anxious person taking it FTW (in case it helps others calm their anxiety.),"Dr prescribed 20 mg to start with (and some Valium as back up! that's how anxious i was at his office)

6 am- woke up,  a probiotic and a protein shake with frozen banana , collagen and whole milk. SKIPPED coffee which was already given me the shakes as Coffee is the only thing that helps me function.

7am -took Vyvanse and took dog for a walk. Messaged a whole bunch of people as i live alone and i was freaked out, i'm not gonna lie. But i had to try it.  
Half an hour in, I notice a sense of calm, and incredible hyper awareness of the warm breeze, the trees, the sky, and the fog in my mind and non stop chatter disappearing.

8-9am working from home, continued to feel calm and focused, yet VERY thirsty, (it's summer where i live and hot as hell) turned air con and continued drinking a lot of water.

10am -where did my anxiety go?? I feel so calm.

12pm- lunch break, force myself to eat something small, fail miserable and continue to do about 10 errands i've managed to put off the last two weeks. I'm somehow hungry by 1pm try to order a burrito, and somehow manage to order one with meat only on the app, I think my vision was a bit blurry from lack of food and coffee! i started eating it when i got home and it tasted like cardboard, checked my order and alas i had deselected rice and all ingredients that make it a burrito. This stupid mistake would have sent me into an annoying spiral of hating myself and making me more anxious as i now had to make another lunch and was late for a work meeting (wfh). But again, no anxiety just felt VERY CALM which is ODD for me.

2-5.30pm- continue work and drink coconut water to hydrate, got a mammoth headache but i know this is from lack of my three espressos a day i use to function so i had half a can of coke and some ibuprofen. Headache gone shortly after.

6pm- went to a gym class and struggled to follow it, was tired and losing focus but i did it and the instructor was very kind to help and redirect me, despite the fact I kept doing everything wrong. This really annoyed me as I do these classes twice a week for years so i know what i am doing but alas, my body needed rest and i kept pushing.

7-8pm- Feeling tired, a little anxious now and no appetite but i will force myself to eat dinner.

I can't believe i went an entire day without a panic attack or not being able to breathe or having anxious thoughts.

Tomorrow I will probably skip it as i need to go to the office and I am worried if i do have a weird side effect I don't want to have it at work.

I am also on Mounjaro and I was very stressed about mixing them despite my dr saying it was completely OK. I have skipped this week's mounjaro dose on his advice to give Vyvanse a few days to work and see how i feel about it.

But above all, if you're worried about starting like i was- don't be, because it might actually calm your anxiety?? which is what my Dr said would happen.

The constant dry mouth a bit of an elevated heart rate, and being hotter and sweatier than usual were the worst side effects so far, will see how the rest of it goes.

I'll be taking magnesium glycinate before bed, which is what i do every night but i am pretty tired and hope i do sleep.",9,1769596977.0,adhdwomen,3,0.92,False

1qp7z5m,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1qp7z5m/the_mojave_station_knows_your_name/,The Mojave Station Knows Your Name.,"The conductor’s porcelain mask was impossibly smooth. I wanted to speak, but no sound came out. My hands shook as I reached for the punch card. 

The numbers and coordinates on it shifted under my fingers, as if alive. The card listed a single location: a white sedan with a slow leak in the rear passenger tire. The same car I had seen parked at the edge of the station when we first descended into the shaft.

I turned, expecting to see Gary, the man whose logo had been carved into the Art Deco walls back in the Mojave. Nothing. Just the endless white platform stretching in all directions. The sky above was still a painted sunset: no sun, no clouds, just color. Every tile, every brass plate was aware of me.

The low rhythmic click started again, faster this time, echoing through my skull. I looked at Marcus. He wasn’t there. Not physically. His towel lay in a neat pile on the bed, but the porcelain shards were gone. The bed was empty.

A voice came from behind me. Gary. But not the man I had ever known. It sounded like every Gary I had ever met, layered into one impossible timbre.

“You shouldn’t be here,” he said.

I spun, but the platform stretched endlessly. The train was already at the far end, sleek, black, unmarked, humming quietly. The doors slid open. Inside, hundreds of seats waited, empty—or maybe not. Something moved too fast to recognize.

The punch card slipped from my hand and floated toward the train doors, as if gravity had reversed. My legs moved on their own, carrying me forward. I had no choice.

Inside the train, the air smelled of old paper, floor wax, and coffee. A faint hum vibrated through the seats. At the center, a console glowed with the same neon green pulse that had overtaken my devices. Terminal overrides, sector 14, repatriation. The train, the station, the punch cards—it was all part of a system. And I had been enrolled.

A screen flickered on the console. My name. Marcus’ name. And underneath: Passenger 70,001—the system adds me now.

The train moved before I could react. Outside the window, the Mojave was gone. Arizona was gone. Instead, a grid of white rectangles, brass railings, and endless stations stretched into impossible distances. Each station hummed in perfect sync.

The screen changed. Gary’s face appeared, unmasked now. His eyes were black voids. “Welcome to the system,” he said. “The Exclusion Zone was never a place. It’s a condition.”

The hum became unbearable, vibrating through my jaw and teeth. Every time I blinked, my body flickered. My skin, my bones, my reflection in the polished brass—glitching, momentarily replaced by white porcelain. I thought I was transforming, or maybe the station was rewriting me.

A final note appeared on the screen: The next stop is not for you. Passengers may be repatriated or archived. Compliance is mandatory.

The train reached the first stop. A station like the one I had left, but this one had people on the benches. Mummies. Hands fused to skulls. Eyes staring. They turned slowly toward me.

I knew then. There was no escape.

The conductor stepped forward, punch card in hand, and smiled or maybe he didn’t. I could feel it choosing me, rewriting me. The terminal pulsed in sync with my teeth.

I am writing this now because if I stop, I will be overwritten. If I survive, maybe someone will read it.

But listen carefully. If your teeth start vibrating while reading, don’t look away. You are part of the passenger list. The hum is already inside you.

The train doors are closing.

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

My first 2 jobs were absolutely terrible. I was a paralegal in a law firm. My first boss would yell at me when i made a mistake, call me 'dumb' in front of everyone, and comment on my looks (we are both women). 

Second boss is the opposite. She wouldn't talk to me unless absolutely necessary, always gives me the silent treatment for a couple of weeks and suddenly yell at me one day about a mistake i made 3 weeks ago. She also expected me to stay behind every day even though the work is not urgent. If not, she would call me lazy (again, in front of everyone).

In both cases i talked to HR but they weren't able to help. Other juniors are also facing the same issue but they put up with it for the future, money etc. 

However these 2 partners both seemed really nice during our interviews and coffee chats. Now I am in a much better place, but unfortunately i have to relocate to another state because of my husband and have to look for a new job.

Asking in this sub for some advice because it’s a little embarrassing and awkward to ask the people in my life but I have a bit of a concern. 

As many of us have faced changes in bowel movements from long term consequences of a restrictive eating disorder, I need some advice. I’ve been in recovery for a while now, I have a healthy, stable, regular period, but my bowel movements have been terrible. For months. 

I usually only have a bowel movement every 4-5 days and it’s typically like super hard, but once a month it’ll be like really watery and terrible. 

The last few days I’ve been really really constipated. I don’t drink a lot of water, it’s a pretty bad habit. But I’ve been upping my water intake, after a weird hangover (only had a couple of drinks but got really sick on Saturday so I’ve been drinking a lot more water) yet I haven’t had a bowel movement. I took a few laxatives, had a few iced coffees that I practically inhaled, had nicotine, and still, nothing. It’s like my third day of my period as well and usually I have one of those terrible “period shits” the first or second day. 

Has anybody else related to this? Any advice on how to proceed? I don’t want to go to a doctor yet as I haven’t met my deductible yet and I’m waiting to use that on another medical procedure for an unrelated condition. But I’m getting sort of uncomfortable and certainly a little worried.

if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1qp7ui6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qp7ui6,So I dived into tea ...,"Being a coffee drinker for decades, I thought I would give tea a try. Tea from the UK, to be exact. British, scottish, irish, whatever I could get here in Germany. I read a wee bit and looked for online shops. For a shop who sells his tea as samples, especially. Because I didnt want to splash money on any big bag of tea only to realise I dont like it.



Enters [https://derirlandshop.de/55-Teeproben-im-Probierset-je-5-Beutel](https://derirlandshop.de/55-Teeproben-im-Probierset-je-5-Beutel) which is the only shop I found who does this. 11 different teas, five bags each, thats quite the service for the beginner (and very probably a whole lot of work, assembling these samples).



So now I am drinking one after the other - beginner's setting: 3min of brewtime and a splash of milk - and to my surprise the differences are huge. After this first round, I'll do another with a prolonged brewtime to give those teas a chance who didnt make it through first round. And so on ...",19,1769596370.0,tea,1,0.96,False
