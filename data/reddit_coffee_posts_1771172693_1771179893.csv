1r5lvhw,https://i.redd.it/0k62e4ixapjg1.jpeg,Do I consider my friend a caregiver?,"Hey there. I (26NB) am not sure if I'm an age regressor yet (if you're kind enough to help me understand this, please look up the post on my page) but I see my behaviour change around my friend. 

So, she's a pre-transition trans woman (32TF), let's call her June. I met June when I started working in a secondhand store (really low payment but all the staff and audience are old friends and I love being there). She visits each of us every day, bringing us coffee, sweets and other treats, cuz she knows we all don't earn much. June is in IT, so she earns well and can afford it. She's really cuddly and we can sit on the floor for two hours straight and just cuddle. I call her my beauty and my girl when nobody hears us. 

I noticed how over time, my attitude towards her changed. When June enters the store, I'm jumping up and down, whispering ""my beauty"" in her ear, tugging her to cuddle on the floor, trying to give her gifts or nurture her in other ways. June refuses because she says she is ""egoistic and loves making people happy"". This unconditional dynamic is new for me and I'm sometimes anxious because affirming my bond with people helps me with my abandonment issues. 

I noticed myself getting whiny and requesting headpats, or talking in a small voice to her, asking my stupid autistic questions, like ""why can't we print more money?"", and she always answers, doesn't judge me. I nuzzle her hair because it's cold in the store and my nose is freezing. With June, silence doesnt scare me. I wanna cuddle with her properly, like, in bed, or sit in her lap. I don't quite feel she's an older figure, I just... act silly and can't help it. My body aches when she's not holding me. I'm jumping up and down at the thought June is gonna visit me in the store. 

I've never felt like this towards anyone, even my ex-partner. Is this how having a caregiver feels? I mean, I'm not imposing this role on her, but I kinda think that one day, I could trust her enough to ask for helping me with my feeding bottle? 

Here's the pic of June and I. She, sitting on the chair and installing dozens of Minecraft mods on my laptop. Me, sitting on the floor, holding her hand and nuzzling her lap and demanding headpats.",1,1771179813.0,ageregression,0,1.0,False

But in 2026? That's cute. Real knowledge now is about connecting dots faster than AI, thinking critically when everyone's drowning in information, and actually applying what you learn instead of just hoarding it in your brain like a digital packrat.

I've spent the last few years reverse engineering how genuinely smart people (not just degree hoarders) actually learn. Dug through neuroscience research, interviewed people who seem to know everything about everything, and tested strategies from books, podcasts, and YouTube rabbit holes. Here's what actually works when you want to level up your brain game.

The truth is, most of us were never taught how to learn. We were taught to memorize and regurgitate. Schools optimized us for standardized tests, not for actually absorbing and synthesizing knowledge. Add social media's destruction of our attention spans, and you've got a generation that consumes information but retains almost nothing. But once you understand how your brain actually works and what's hijacking it, you can flip the script.

## Step 1: Build Your Knowledge Operating System First

You can't become dangerously knowledgeable if your brain is a messy filing cabinet. Most people consume content randomly, read books they forget a week later, watch educational videos that evaporate from memory. You need a system.

Start with Obsidian or Notion as your second brain. Every piece of knowledge you consume gets processed through your system. Read something interesting? Summarize it in your own words. Watched a killer YouTube video? Extract the core concepts. This isn't about creating pretty notes. It's about forcing your brain to actively process instead of passively consume.

The key is the Zettelkasten method, which sounds fancy but basically means: Make atomic notes (one idea per note), link related concepts together, and review regularly. Your brain remembers through connections, not isolation. When you link ""cognitive biases"" to ""marketing psychology"" to ""personal relationships,"" suddenly you're seeing patterns everywhere.

Here's the brutal part: If you can't explain something simply, you don't actually understand it. So after you consume anything, write a 3 sentence summary like you're explaining it to a smart 12 year old. Can't do it? You didn't really learn it.

## Step 2: Read Like Your Life Depends on It (Because It Kind Of Does)

Books are still the highest ROI knowledge source, period. One book represents years of someone's expertise compressed into 300 pages. But here's the catch, you're probably reading wrong.

""[How to Read a Book](https://www.amazon.com/How-Read-Book-Classic-Intelligent/dp/0671212095)"" by Mortimer Adler is the meta book that teaches you how to actually extract knowledge from books. Adler was a philosopher and educator who literally wrote the book (pun intended) on reading comprehension. This thing won the National Book Award and it's basically the instruction manual for your brain that school never gave you. Most people skim or read passively. Adler breaks down analytical reading, syntopical reading (reading multiple books on the same topic to compare ideas), and how to have a conversation with the author. After reading this, I realized I'd been wasting hundreds of hours on books I barely remembered. This book will make you question everything you think you know about reading. Insanely good.

Don't just read one genre. Dangerous knowledge comes from cross pollination. Read psychology, then business, then philosophy, then biology. The magic happens when you connect ""antifragile"" from Nassim Taleb to evolutionary biology to your own life decisions.

Speed reading is mostly bullshit, by the way. You can't speed read your way to deep knowledge. What works is reading with purpose. Before opening any book, ask yourself: What specific question am I trying to answer? Then hunt for those answers aggressively.

## Step 3: Become a Master Learner, Not a Content Consumer

There's a massive difference between consuming information and actually learning. Learning requires active engagement. Neuroscience shows that retrieval practice (testing yourself) is exponentially more effective than passive review.

After reading a chapter, close the book and write down everything you remember. It'll feel uncomfortable. You'll realize you retained maybe 20%. That discomfort is where learning happens. Then go back and fill in gaps.

Use spaced repetition through apps like Anki. Your brain forgets information predictably over time (the forgetting curve), but if you review at specific intervals, you can hack this. Anki uses algorithms to show you information right before you're about to forget it. Medical students use this to memorize thousands of facts. You can use it for anything.

The Feynman Technique is your other weapon. Named after physicist Richard Feynman, it's dead simple: Pick a concept. Teach it to someone (or pretend you are). When you get stuck, that's your knowledge gap. Go back, relearn that part, then teach it again. Repeat until you can explain it smoothly.

## Step 4: Curate Your Information Diet Like a Psycho

You are what you consume, mentally. If you're scrolling TikTok for 3 hours daily, your brain is getting optimized for dopamine hits, not deep thinking. Time to get militant about your inputs.

Unsubscribe from 90% of everything. Most newsletters, YouTube channels, podcasts, and social media accounts are just noise. Keep only the absolute S tier sources that consistently teach you something valuable.

For podcasts, Huberman Lab is non negotiable. Andrew Huberman is a neuroscientist at Stanford and his podcast dives deep into how your brain and body actually work. We're talking sleep optimization, dopamine regulation, learning protocols, all backed by legitimate research. Each episode is like a free college course. He breaks down complex neuroscience into actionable protocols you can use immediately.

YouTube is actually underrated for knowledge if you're selective. Channels like Veritasium (science and critical thinking), Ali Abdaal (productivity and learning), and Lex Fridman's interviews with world class thinkers are goldmines.

If you want to go deeper but struggle with finding time or energy to read through dozens of books and research papers, [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) might be worth checking out. It's an AI powered learning app built by Columbia alumni and former Google engineers that turns books, research, and expert content into personalized audio podcasts.

You can literally type in something like ""I want to master critical thinking and spot cognitive biases in my daily life"" and it'll pull from psychology books, neuroscience research, and expert talks to create a custom learning plan with episodes tailored to your exact goal. The depth control is clutch, you can toggle between a quick 10 minute overview or a 40 minute deep dive with examples when something really hooks you. Plus the voice options are surprisingly addictive, there's even a smoky, sarcastic narrator that makes complex topics way more engaging during commutes or gym sessions. Makes it easier to actually retain what you're learning instead of just passively consuming.

Kill your news addiction. Daily news is designed to make you anxious and uninformed. Read weekly summaries instead, or better yet, read books about historical events and you'll understand the present way better than watching CNN.

## Step 5: Build a Learning Routine That Sticks

Knowledge without consistency is just random trivia. You need a daily learning routine that's so easy you can't say no.

My non negotiable: One hour every morning before any distractions. 30 minutes reading, 15 minutes processing notes, 15 minutes reviewing spaced repetition cards. That's it. Seven hours a week compounds into hundreds of hours yearly.

Use implementation intentions: ""When I drink my morning coffee, I will read for 30 minutes."" Your brain loves these if-then patterns. Attach learning to existing habits.

Interleaving is another neuroscience backed technique. Don't study one topic for hours. Mix it up. Study psychology for 30 minutes, then switch to history, then philosophy. Feels less efficient but actually creates stronger neural pathways.

## Step 6: Learn in Public and Test Your Knowledge

Here's where most people fail. They consume and consume but never output. Learning in public forces clarity.

Start a blog, Twitter thread, or YouTube channel where you explain what you're learning. Sounds scary? Good. Fear means growth. You don't need to be an expert. Just share what you learned this week. Teaching forces you to organize your thoughts and exposes gaps in your understanding.

Join communities where smart people hang out. Reddit's r/lectures, r/philosophy, and niche subreddits for whatever you're learning. Engage in discussions. When someone challenges your understanding, that's free feedback on your knowledge gaps.

Apply what you learn immediately. Read about negotiation? Negotiate something today. Learn about cognitive biases? Spot them in your own thinking. Knowledge that doesn't connect to action is just entertainment.

## Step 7: Embrace Intellectual Humility (The Secret Weapon)

The most dangerously knowledgeable people know how much they don't know. Dunning Kruger effect means beginners overestimate their competence while experts understand complexity.

""[Thinking, Fast and Slow](https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-and-Slow/dp/0374533555)"" by Daniel Kahneman is essential here. Kahneman won the Nobel Prize in Economics for his work on cognitive biases and decision making. This book reveals how your brain tricks you constantly, how you're way less rational than you think, and how to recognize these patterns. Fair warning, this book is dense but it's the best book I've ever read on how human thinking actually works versus how we think it works. After reading it, you'll never trust your gut the same way again.

Always ask: What could I be wrong about? What's the strongest argument against my position? This makes you intellectually antifragile.

Seek out people smarter than you and ask questions. Most people are flattered when you genuinely want to learn from them. Email that author whose book changed your life. Comment thoughtfully on that YouTuber's video. You'd be surprised how accessible knowledge holders are.

## Step 8: Develop Your Unique Knowledge Stack

The real competitive advantage isn't being the best at one thing. It's combining multiple skills and knowledge areas in unique ways. Scott Adams (Dilbert creator) calls this ""talent stacking.""

Maybe you're pretty good at psychology, decent at writing, and understand basic statistics. Combine those and suddenly you can create compelling data driven content about human behavior. That's a rare combination.

Build your stack intentionally. Pick 3-5 domains that interest you and go deep. Don't try to know everything about everything. That's shallow knowledge. Go for T shaped knowledge: Deep in a few areas, broad understanding of many.

The dangerous part comes from unexpected combinations. Steve Jobs combined calligraphy with technology. Elon Musk combines physics with business with engineering. What weird combinations can you create?

---

Real talk: This isn't a fast process. You're not going to become dangerously knowledgeable in a month. But in a year of consistent daily learning? You'll be unrecognizable. While everyone else is mindlessly scrolling, you'll be building a knowledge base that compounds.

I just worry he’s getting very bored being at home with just me 5 days a week. The first 3 1/2 months of his life, I felt like super-mom. Had a ridiculous amount of energy to get things done and spend quality time and loved every second of it. However, I’ve recently hit a wall. Perhaps im depressed but im definitely exhausted. (I am seeing a psychiatrist trying to get a hold on things).. The days are blurring together and I can tell my baby wants to do more than just floor time, time in the swing, grabbing for different toys, etc. I also deal with a lot of chronic pain and have been having some horrible flare-ups recently so even getting down on the floor with him can be a challenge. I’ve been feeling an insane amount of guilt since introducing Ms Rachel to him on the tv a few weeks ago… it makes him happy and occupied for the time being and I can at least lay down, drink coffee, let my meds kick in before peeling myself up off the couch to try to salvage the day! But it makes me feel so horrible and like im rotting his brain or something. I’ve done research and understand there is no direct correlation between tv time and any developmental challenges as long as he is still receiving connection&love.. but it doesn’t feel right but at the same time I am so low energy, don’t have a huge village to help me out so im just trying my best but I feel really bad about it. He is rolling over, grabbing things, rocking back and forth a bit trying to crawl, getting better at sitting up by himself, babbling/coo-ing/squealing, hitting all milestones on time. 

I look up all day ways to entertain him. I put random items in zip-lock baggies and let him explore the textures. I fill a baking dish with water and throw him over a pillow and let him splash around and pick things out. I carry him around and let him look at random stuff. I’ve been reading more books to him. I “narrate’ all the things I do. I squeal back and forth with him. I let him sit and watch me do stuff around the house while I talk to him. But all these activities are lucky to last 5 minutes then we have the entire rest of the day!!! I can tell he wants to be able to do more but his little body just has limited capabilities right now :( and im extremely exhausted and also very nervous as a FTM that im not enriching him enough.. \*\*\*

TLDR: feeling very guilty about putting the tv on sometimes for my 5 month old but im hitting an extreme point of exhaustion and looking for some fun but not too stimulating activities for him.

*The two walked around the corner, and through the door. While the taller went to the til and ordered two lattes, the shorter marveled at the interior, like they had never seen a coffee shop before. A few minutes later, the two walked out, one drink already almost gone.*

So, what do you want to see next?

**Where do people go to relax?**

Well that depends on the person. I go to the park and feed ducks.

**What is a, Pah-ruk?**

I'll show you.

*The two begin to lazily walk through the street, letting the people guide them to where they wished to go.*

First things first though, we need food.

**Why? We don't eat.**

Not for us, for the ducks.

**I understand. The ducks will be satiated.**

*Before long the two arrive at a supermarket. The taller one led the way, considering they knew what frozen pees are. The shorter meanwhile, was lost in the colours of the stock. Once they had found the frozen pees, they went to the til and payed for them, as well as an empty box, several slices of ham, and two sandwiches.*

**What is the purpose of the others?**

*The two slowly make their way to the nearest park.*

To consume. We don't need to eat, but we can if we want to.

**I see. We will consume with the ducks.**

*Finding the park was easy, finding the pond was not. The two wander amongst the green for some time before spotting their target. A pond spreads out across the length of the park, making the two wonder why it took them so long to find it. A gathering of ducks rest at the edge.*

**These are the ducks you spoke of? They are not what I expected. Are not birds meant to have sharp beaks?**

Some are, some are not.

*A look of understanding passed over the shorter one's eyes as the two sat on the grass near the bank. With one fluid motion the bag of pees was sliced open.*

Do as I do, like so.

*The taller one took a small handful of less frozen pees, and tossed them at the pond. The ducks happily ate them all. The shorter did the same, taking more pees, and scattering them towards the lake. Once again the ducks are them all.*

**They are strange creatures. I can see why you do this to relax.**

Yeah. Hungry?

*The taller opened the box and pulled out the ham and sandwiches.*

**No, but I am curious.**

*The shorter took a bite of the sandwich, and once again their eyes widened. The sandwich was gone in a blink. The taller simply smiled, and passed the ham while taking a bite of their own sandwich. The ham too was consumed.*

**This new world, it is much greater than the one before.**

Indeed it is.

**But I don't understand. Why come here?**

Why not? You wished to see the world and I took you to part of it.

**You cannot lie to me. Why are we really here?**

*The taller grew silent, staring off into the distance at something beyond the edges of normal sight.*

Someone lives in this place. Someone I called a friend, someone I let down.

**Mmm...**

*Another handful of pees splashed into the pond.*

**Do you still care?**

Of course I do.

**Then you will go. Once the ducks are satisfied and our supplies are dwindled, you will go to this someone, and you will talk.**

Why? I hurt him once I'll just hurt him again.

**If you leave it like this then you will. If you can salvage this bond then you must try.**

*More flung pees, more happy ducks.*

**You should not leave something broken because you think it can't be fixed.**

But what if it can't be fixed?

**Then you will have tried, and that is better than not.**

*A moment of silence passed, broken only by the sound of happy quacking.*

Will you be okay on your own?

**I survived isolation for longer than empires can dream. I will survive being alone with the ducks for a while.**

Good point.

**Now enough of this for now. You are not eating your sandwich and you are not feeding the ducks.**

*The taller one smiled, and took the bag, throwing now just cold pees at an ever growing group of ducks.*",3,1771179512.0,wizardposting,6,1.0,False

My roomate 25f and me 27m have a touchy relationship where we don’t do anything besides cuddling and a bit of teasing. She also doesn’t mind me listening to her when she’s masturbating

Some days ago she went out, it was a hasty plan cause on the day she was going out she told me in the morning that she told me that she is meeting one of her school friends as they are in the city, but I know that she didn’t

She left around 9 and had dinner and drinks (5/6 glasses of wine- more than enough for her to be crazy drunk ) . And then she told me that she’s just gonna drop him off to his place (this is at 1am) as he is very drunk to drive and have to call someone to drive them to his place .

They reached there at 2am and then she called me for 20seconds- I could hear the door close on the call and she said she’ll be back in an hour.she just wanted to get coffee at his place and if I want to sleep I can’t put the key .

Now exactly at 3am she calls me asking if I’m awake and that she’s on the way home. When she reaches I see that she’s drunk. I don’t know what happened but she’s always said that she actually met a friend and nothing happened. Am I overthinking this.

1r5lp41,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r5lp41,Christmas – New Year’s trip 25-26 with the family (‘kids’ 17 and 20),"I used this sub a LOT when planning our first ever trip to CR, so hope some of the below is useful to other Costa Rica newbies like I was! This is long – buckle up or skim for the most useful. Feel free to ask Qs.

**Overview**: Flew into San Jose, spent 4+ days in La Fortuna, flew to Drake’s Bay, and 5+ days there.

One of the best choices we made: Asked the locals for lots of recommendations

Also, drink the water and eat fresh foods. No need to worry.

**Flight to SJO** – We decided to take a red-eye, as the timing and price were right for us. That got us there a bit blearly eyed, but ok. It was easy getting through customs.

**Car** – We went with Alamo, and honesty they were great. I had read some mixed reviews, but it made sense for us, so we went for it. The shuttle driver to the lot was chatty and helpful. We got a good recommendation for where to grab some food, and he also suggested a great route to La Fortuna (see below). We got the required liability insurance there directly rather than ahead of time (because on the website I couldn’t quite tell what was required and what was optional). We didn’t get any of the optional add ons. 

**Maps and phones** \- Everyone here says use Waze, but we mostly used googlemaps, which never sent us wrong. We also didn’t get extra cell service, and just used what came with our tmobile accounts – slow but it worked fine.

**Drive to La Fortuna** – We took the more northern and eastern route the shuttle driver recommended. It was slightly longer, but so beautiful! The roads were great the whole way (one-lane each direction mostly, windy, but good quality, and v. little traffic in the morning). We stopped at [Panadería Mas Que Pan](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Panader%C3%ADa+M%C3%A1s+Que+Pan/@10.0377718,-84.1962838,15z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x8fa0f7b64f80b1eb:0xa8ca6968ace3a1eb!8m2!3d10.0376704!4d-84.1962239!16s%2Fg%2F11rn02w47c?entry=tts&g_ep=EgoyMDI2MDIxMS4wIPu8ASoASAFQAw%3D%3D&skid=464cee82-1942-48af-9ef1-55adf7e07cd3) in a small town on the way north – yum! 

The shuttle driver had recommended stopping at La Paz waterfall. We did and it was SO lovely. We did not go to the touristy “La Paz Waterfall Gardens Nature Park” but just followed the recommendation to park along the road near the waterfall. That time of day (still morning) parking was easy. You can walk right up to the waterfall, practically directly underneath it.  There was a little fruit and touristy goods stand on the road there, and we bought some of the best mangos we ate the entire trip.  The shuttle driver had recommended [Soda La Campesina](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Soda+La+Campesina/@10.2147272,-84.1690903,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x8fa08cb65d2c2635:0x2039c32587181f3f!8m2!3d10.2147272!4d-84.16651!16s%2Fg%2F11cn8tpqf8?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI2MDIxMS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D), just1 km after the waterfall on the left. They have a lovely view of the waterfall from the tables in back, and the food was great. They put fruit out to attract birds and also had hummingbird feeders. It was an amazing show! 

**La Fortuna**

Yes, this is such a touristy area, and we were there over Christmas, when locals would have, I’m sure, preferred being home with their families. Nonetheless, the Pura Vida attitude shone through, and people were so happy to share “Feliz Navidad”s even with us gringos. If we go to Costa Rica again, I might try to get to more out of the way spots, but truly, there is a reason this is a hot spot. It’s lovely!!

**Housing** \- We stayed at an Airbnb, with a trail to a lovely spot by the river for reading and relaxing. It was absolutely delightful. 

**Groceries** – Because we were at an AirBnB, we cooked some for ourselves. We shopped at **Super Cristian 4**, which had most of what we wanted, and bought lovely fruits and veggies at **Frutas y Verduras del Campo**. Señor at the fruit store, when I loaded up a bunch of fruit on the counter, asked if it was for today or tomorrow (speaking baby Spanish for me – “hoy o mañana”?  When I told him, he took several items back and picked me ones he thought were more appropriate (generally slightly less ripe, and indeed, when we had a feast of a fruit salad the next day, which was Christmas day, they were perfect!). So helpful and kind!

**Adventure** \- The girls and I went canyoning with [Maquique Aventure](https://www.maquiqueadventure.com/?gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=19592855165&gclid=CjwKCAiA-sXMBhAOEiwAGGw6LLGvMK-XrlptVnInjz1Qonicpo6WtbM_BlHCa5acbyWxrS63F5mg7RoCFzcQAvD_BwE) (highly recommend!!) while my husband went for a long run, which he loved. The folks working the canyoning tour were fabulous – so friendly – and the lunch after was honestly one of the best lunches we had. Delicious, with a really nice vegetarian option, too. On the way back from Maquique, we stopped at a roadside truck selling coconuts. Señor was so nice to help me find the right change, and after you drink up the delicious cool coco water, he can hack open the coconut to eat the sweet soft meat inside. It’s definitely worth asking for him to do that! Plain or with Tajine are both great.

**Birding** \- We went to **Mistico**, which I also recommend, but strongly suggest private tour first thing in the AM. Our guide, Donald, said later in the day is practically a solid line of foot traffic. We had a birding tour set up, but Donald really knew everything. He might have been a better birder, though, than if we had set up a general tour. (e.g. the kind of birder who can see a flutter of an lbb (little brown bird) and knows exactly what it is from its behavior). 

Parking there opens at 6:00 on the dot. People who arrived 10 min early for their 6:00 tour (a normal thing to do!) had to park a bit down the hill and hike up. We were running late (by my standards) and arrived at 6:00 exactly, so got to drive up to the main lot, passing folks walking up. Lucky! But if you plan it right, you can do that deliberately, for sure. The walk was fantastic, we saw lots of birds and snakes and a frog, and learned so much about all the different plants, too. Thank you, Donald!!

**Restaurants** – Donald from Mistico recommended [Soda La Palma](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Soda+La+Palma/@10.4757286,-84.7293867,13.24z/data=!4m14!1m7!3m6!1s0x8fa00908b9ca7237:0xc46b0bbd0c3fa059!2sSoda+La+Palma!8m2!3d10.4977442!4d-84.7109641!16s%2Fg%2F11qpq26kfz!3m5!1s0x8fa00908b9ca7237:0xc46b0bbd0c3fa059!8m2!3d10.4977442!4d-84.7109641!16s%2Fg%2F11qpq26kfz?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI2MDIxMS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) for lunch, which was great – again, good meat and veggie options. The food in Costa Rica is generally very mild (at least where we ate) and we asked for hot sauce. They gave us a jar of house-made chilero – pickled julienned vegetables, including hot peppers. The tang and heat were an amazing compliment to the food.  

In town we ate at **Soda y Restaruante Víquez** – simple, good, not expensive. Really enjoyed it. We ate at **El Chante Verde** – which wasn’t traditional at all, and was more expensive, but was also really good. We lucked out getting a table there. They filled up right after we arrived.

**Waterfall** – We went on Christmas Day – because winter is high season, everything was open. Absolutely no need for a tour here. There are indeed a lot of stairs, but it was easy for all of us except for older daughter who can get a bit of exercise induced asthma, and had to take lots of breaks going up.  Wear your suits under your clothes, bring a towel. There are bathrooms at the top to change, but simplest is to just go in your suits if you plan to get in. The waterfall pool itself is lovely. The waterfall is powerful – so there’s chop, splash/mist, and current. Definitely wear well-strapped-on water shoes. The rocks are sharp! Downstream from the waterfall (to the left as you head down to the waterfall), there is a calm area with a sandy bottom and crystal-clear water. It’s lovely for relaxing in a way the waterfall isn’t. Be prepared, especially in high season, for LOTS of people. It was worth the trip, but there’s a constant stream of traffic.

**Arenal Volcano park** – We had a great hike here – it’s well signed, and easy to get around.

**Getting to Drakes Bay**

We drove back the (slightly) shorter way to San Jose, got a ride to the Domestic terminal, and flew to Drake’s Bay. I missed getting tickets on Sansa so for some unintended additional expense, we flew down on a charter with Green Air. Even though this wasn't in the plan, it wasn't as pricey as you might think, and it was honestly a highlight of the trip. The views were fabulous, and it was an easy travel day. Our hosts (Casa Horizontale) picked us up from the tiny airport.

**Drakes Bay**

**Lodging** – We stayed at [Casa Horizontale](https://www.casahorizontescorcovado.com/), where Pedro, Gloriana, Gretel and Yami took amazing care of us. They welcomed us with fresh fruit and provided a lovely traditional breakfast each morning from a balcony with amazing ocean views, plus birds coming to eat fruit put out for them, and lots of iguanas hanging out in the trees. A simple version of breakfast was available before 6 AM for days when we were going on early tours. Gretel, who staff’s the What’s App, can organize absolutely anything both months prior to arrival and there on site, and was so incredibly helpful. We stayed in one of their units without AC (with mosquito nets and fans). That worked great for us, but they also have units with AC. The driveway there is quite steep, so if you stay there, be sure to have good shoes that won’t slip as you head to/from town.

**Diving** – my younger daughter and I are divers, and Gretel arranged a dive trip out to Caño Island for us. The water isn’t crystal clear Caribbean fare but was nice! We saw lots of turtles, white-tipped reef sharks, rays, fish including eels (and garden eels! So many tiny eels!), lobster, and more. The dive master was great and managed the different abilities and air usage really well, getting folks who sucked down their air fast safely to the boat, and giving the rest of us a longer dive. As I posted in a comment elsewhere – be sure to take your Dramamine if you get motion sick (like my daughter does). It was a pretty calm day, but what with picking up additional divers down the coast, and the fairly long ride out to the island, she was about to lose it before got into the water (even with Dramamine). Nothing like cool water to help, though!

**Corcovado National Park** – we went for an overnight at the national park, staying at Sirena station. We used **Sukia**, and the group was just us!! (Also, the boat also stopped at a lovely ater fall on the way to the park (which most boats didn’t). Most groups we passed were 10 people or more, so we felt really lucky to have a small group. We saw a sloth (from far off), all the monkeys, a tapir, an anteater, peccaries (mating!!! All the guides said they had never seen that before), SO many amazing birds, iguanas, and I’m sure there’s more I’m forgetting. Recommendations: do stay overnight. In the afternoon after the day crowds left, and in the morning before they arrive were the best times. No need to stay multiple nights. There’s only so much trail right there!  Do bring some cash (dollars or colones) for snacks and drinks. For sleeping, bring something to cover your eyes plus ear plugs as there’s always someone getting up for the loo. We all brought portable battery packs for our phones, but ended up not truly needing them – there were outlets around. There is a wifi hotspot – not great, but enough to check in with family.

**Other activities in Drake’s bay** – The walk to Cocalito Beach was lovely, and the beach is paradise. So easy to get burned if you’re fair, so cover up! Kiddo and I snorkeled around the rocks to the next cover. Just lovely!  

The main beach in Drakes bay isn’t necessarily a great place to swim (not bad, though). We had multiple morning and evening walks up and down the beach, though. The N end of the beach is a great place to see the sunset! 

Gretel set up a massage for my older daughter – the masseuse came right to our place and set up on the porch. It was a really nice treat. 

Younger daughter and I went horseback riding. I’ve written about that elsewhere in more details, but briefly, ask for a short 45 min ride on the beach at sunset, and do NOT go to the waterfall (which is far too hard on the horses).

**Restaurants** – As I wrote in a comment elsewhere, we liked Kalaluna bistro (catch of the day - yum), smoothy's from Gaby's shack right across the street from the beach and other lunchy things, Las Cotingas (pricy with AMAZING ceviche), Coco Café (really good pizza!). I was not a fan of Bucaneros, personally. We were warned off of Roberto’s so didn’t try it.

**Return**

We flew back to SJO, stayed at Hampton by Hilton in order to get a direct flight back to Denver the next morning. The Hampton was just fine. It was a bit chaotic checking in, just given high season, but they were great. Their breakfast started after we needed to leave for the airport, but if you asked at the front desk, you could get a little “to go” breakfast – just a muffin and a granola bar – but even that was nice to tide us over. Coffee was ready early enough!

Hope this is useful for folks for planning! Feel free to ask Qs if you have them.",2,1771179403.0,CostaRicaTravel,0,1.0,False

I’ve been on reddit for quite some time, but this is a throwaway bcs i don’t want people I know irl to find the post.

I’ve been seeing a guy for about a month, we’re from different countries, but we’ve met in my home country. Last week was my birthday, I just turned 19 and he’ll be 24 soon.

He wanted to come back to my country for a week to celebrate my birthday. I told him that’s quite a lot especially because I’ll be busy w my job (babysitting, around 5-7h everyday), university, volunteering (4 associations). 

He insisted he doesn’t mind and that he can do things by himself in the city while I’m busy and we’ll see each other whenever I can. I knew he wasn’t honest about it and I was right. He got mad at me because I wasn’t with him everyday, because I didn’t pick up the phone while watching a movie with my family, because we celebrated separately (I’ve done separate bday celebrations w all my groups of friends, but the main party was with friends I’ve known for years) and he obviously wasn’t invited. He was mad I could see him for maybe 3h, 4/7 days and another night I slept over at his place. 

His plane ticket was today at 4 pm. He was very mad since yesterday because I couldn’t come over (plans with family that he already knew about for weeks) to watch rugby with him. Today at around 3:50 I get a call from an unknown number, I answer. It’s a grown man with a deep voice berating me for making that guy cry. I am confused and creeped out bcs 

1) why would he have my number

2) what is happening

So i kindly ask that guy to delete my phone number and not get into private matters and call the guy I’m seeing. Long story short, he wasn’t allowed to board the plane because he was too drunk and became aggressive. He passed the phone to the workers at the airport, I apologize on his behalf and they told me I’m very lovely, that nothing will happen to him and not to worry, they’ll help him get his bag back and book another ticket. 

After a couple of minutes he calls me again and gives the phone to some police officers. I talk to them as well, I apologize on his behalf and they tell me the same thing “You’re a very nice young lady, don’t worry, nothing will happen to him, but please talk to him because he is becoming very aggressive.”

I was very happy about how they handled everything until I get another call at around 7:30 pm. It’s another police officer that asks me my full name and different questions about how I know this guy. I only gave him my last name after confirming his identity and explained everything. 

It’s been half an hour and this guy is telling me that I’ve abandoned him and that I’m forcing him to sleep in the airport (I said no to him sleeping over at my place tonight, **his flight is tomorrow at 8 am**). He’s been very mean about everything, especially telling me how much he spent on everything to come see me. He also brought up the difference in how we were raised (his family had to move to another country and were poor for 2-3 years, me being born in a family that was good financially, but with some rough years, which he knows about). He does have a good job as an engineer tho and, I feel like I should  add this: we only went out to eat once and the rest of the time was at cafes, a coffee being around €5).

The main reasons to why I’m refusing to help him is because he brought this to himself and because of how he has treated me all week.

I’m really sorry for the long post

AITA? Should I just let him come over to my place after everything? Am i overreacting?",0,1771179401.0,AITAH,6,0.5,False
1r5lotm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1r5lotm/should_we_really_be_avoiding_caffeine/,Should we really be avoiding caffeine?,"I've been dealing with anxiety in various forms since I was a little kid. For me personally it's always been health anxiety and then the sort of fear-of-fear of anxiety that so many of us experience where we feel a bit of anxiety, react to it and cause more anxiety, and eventually ratchet up to a full blown panic attack. 

One of the pieces of received wisdom around here is to cut caffeine, and it's something I've done a number of times. Years ago I drank two coffees a day and sometimes a coke after work and now I just have one green tea in the morning and that's it. I've tried to quit completely I found after a couple weeks it just left me listless and depressed so I settled on a green tea every day. 

But for someone who fears physical sensations and the feeling of anxiety itself I often wonder how much of this is helpful and how much is a safety/avoidance behaviour that only serves to feed the anxiety. During one of the lowest anxiety periods of my life, after I quit drinking and did a couple of years of therapy, I started drinking coffee again and I managed it well for several years. But then the anxiety came back and I switched back to green tea. 

Now I have these really unhelpful beliefs like: 

* I can't handle caffeine
* It would be bad if I felt stimulated or jittery
* The feelings that caffeine gives me are dangerous and should be avoided 

Is this really serving me? I'll be honest with you, just the thought of drinking a coffee makes me anxious. I would almost certainly start experiencing symptoms before the caffeine would have a chance to actually affect me physiologically. For people who get anxiety from situations or places the advice is always don't avoid, expose. I personally don't have a lot of situational anxiety, I'm anxious of physical sensations. So shouldn't I be doing the things that trigger those sensations rather than avoiding them?

Honestly the 9th bar tastes way better and a bit sweeter than the one that went over. What will be the benefits chasing that 12th bar?

1r5lo5y,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCreativeContent/comments/1r5lo5y/level_up_your_style_with_stranger_thingsthemed/,Level Up Your Style with Stranger Things-Themed Socks,"If you’re a fan of retro vibes, supernatural twists, and bold 80s aesthetics, it’s time to level up your wardrobe in a fun and subtle way. One of the easiest ways to show off your personality without going overboard? Statement socks. More specifically, themed socks inspired by your favorite sci-fi universe. They’re small, stylish, and surprisingly powerful when it comes to upgrading your everyday look.

Here’s why adding them to your collection is a game-changer:

* **Instant Conversation Starter** Rocking themed socks instantly signals that you’re part of the fandom. Whether you're at school, work, or just out grabbing coffee, someone is bound to notice and spark a conversation.
* **Nostalgic 80s Aesthetic** Bold colors, retro fonts, and iconic imagery capture that throwback energy perfectly. It’s like wearing a tiny piece of the Upside Down… but in a cool way.
* **Low-Key Fandom Flex** Not everyone wants to wear loud graphic tees every day. Socks let you keep things subtle. From the outside, it’s just a stylish outfit. But when you sit down or roll up your jeans? Boom. Hidden fandom reveal.
* **Versatile Styling Options** Pair them with sneakers, boots, or even slides. Wear them with shorts for a bold statement or let them peek out under tailored pants for a fun contrast.
* **Comfort Meets Personality** Great socks don’t just look good — they feel good. Soft fabrics, snug fits, and breathable materials make them perfect for daily wear.

Beyond the style factor, there’s something undeniably fun about dressing with intention. Fashion doesn’t always have to be serious. Sometimes it’s about adding small details that make you smile. Themed socks are like Easter eggs in your outfit — a personal nod to something you genuinely enjoy.

**Stranger Things socks** bring that perfect mix of spooky, nostalgic, and playful energy. Whether they feature iconic symbols, bold lettering, or retro color palettes, they add personality without overwhelming your look. They’re ideal for binge-watching nights, casual hangouts, conventions, or even just lounging at home while rewatching your favorite episodes. It’s not just about the design — it’s about wearing something that connects you to a story you love.

At the end of the day, style is about self-expression. You don’t need a full wardrobe overhaul to make an impact. Sometimes, it starts from the ground up. A great pair of themed socks can transform an ordinary outfit into something memorable. So if you’re looking to upgrade your style in a fun, effortless way, this might just be your next favorite addition.

Go ahead — let your socks do the talking.",1,1771179343.0,TheCreativeContent,0,1.0,False

Ever since I started, alls been smooth-my partners are great, feel like I’ve been trained well, and enjoying the work so far. Except this certain partner (A). From day ONE, complete attitude out of nowhere and I had no idea why! Totally ignoring me when asking for help, only choosing to nitpick my mistakes when she sees a shift near us, going out of her way to socialize with other partners and leaving me out, and pushing past me several times with plenty of space to move without touching me, etc etc. 

I get it, you’re not friends with everyone you work with. But at the very least you’re CORDIAL and polite. I told my sister about this and she came in to my store to order something while A was on shift with me and she completely recognized her and gave me an epiphany. A couple months ago I came in with my sister and we ordered drinks and sat in with the for-here ware. My sister wanted a refill after a bit, so I went to the counter and it was A who I interacted with!! (I have horrible facial recognition so I didn’t remember her when I got hired lol) A told me you couldn’t get a refill if your first drink wasn’t an iced coffee/tea and I politely told her the policy was a refill of iced coffee/tea regardless of what your first drink was. As I was saying this the shift came out (who happened to be the SM/hiring manager/sorry I totally don’t know the lingo yet). He was so surprised that I knew the policy well and I’ve already been a regular that he offered me the job right then and there 😭 And according to my sister, A looked so peeved. The SM even said “when a customer knows the policy better than our baristas that’s someone I want to hire” (did not help my case with A at all). 

So I’m sure she remembered my face clearly since that day and was rightfully more pissed that I got hired right after that. Don’t know what else I couldve, I was just trying to get my sister a refill and I would have never expected to get hired there lol!! The fact she held a grudge for months until I got my interview and fully hired is crazy to me because I really didn’t think it was a big deal. However she is actively affecting my quality of life at work and disrupting my tasks.

This was a bit of a vent and maybe needing some advice, but I have never been in any sort of drama in school or work so I have no idea how to navigate this. I’ve been currently just ignoring her back. Should I just leave it be and keep dreading going in when I see we have a shift together? Should I confront her head on and ask her what she needs from me so we can get past all this crap? I just want to do my job and leave lol I don’t need all this. ",1,1771179338.0,starbucks,1,1.0,False

In the late 19th century, the Japanese, specifically Foreign Minister Takiyaki (or something like that, I don't remember exactly how it was spelled), wanted to create a ""colony"" by establishing a migration company which was supposed to Promote Japanese migration in the Pacific and influence Mexico to align itself with Japan.

Note: I'm not Mexican, so this is probably full of historical errors, which is fine, it's just fiction, If you want, don't read and just enjoy the map.

In this scenario, migration exploded due to an economic crisis on the island, causing several Japanese citizens to migrate to Chiapas in search of opportunities, This caused the coffee business in the area to grow, making its economy grow even more.

The Mexican government allowed this because it helped the industrialization of the area and local trade.

Soon, with the Mexican Civil War, a pro-Japanese movement was created in the area, The movement soon aligned itself with Díaz, to the point where he became a Japanese puppet Under orders from Tokyo, and with the help of the German Empire and the Japanese Empire, it won the civil war. After Diaz's death, a pro-Japanese military government takes control, giving autonomy and more economic control to Chiapas, which on paper was part of Mexico, despite having its own government and economic zone.

With the arrival of World War II, the United States entered the war, invading Mexico and establishing a ""democracy,"" turning Chiapas under official US occupation, becoming an independent state in 1952

I’m a female FiveM roleplayer looking for someone to build an actual long-term storyline with. Not a one-night scene, not just driving around silent — I mean actual character development, late night RP sessions, dumb moments, serious moments, and the kind of RP where you actually care if the other person logs on.

My character is more of a girly but chaotic type — she’ll go shopping, get coffee, hang out at the pier… but she’ll also absolutely panic during a robbery and somehow make everything worse 😭

What I’m looking for:  
• Someone who actually stays in character  
• Protective/loyal personality (MC, gang member, criminal, or even a morally grey cop is fine)  
• Not overly controlling OOC  
• Someone who enjoys slow-burn story RP  
• We can do robberies, kidnappings, drama arcs, arguments, and wholesome moments too

I want a storyline where we actually *build something*:  
meeting randomly → becoming friends → tension → chaos → loyalty → ride or die type arc.

I’m active evenings and late nights CST and I stay consistent once I get into a story.

I’m open to IRL dating — strictly RP — I just enjoy immersive storytelling and character connection.

If you like dramatic storylines, character attachment, and you won’t disappear after two days, DM me and tell me about your character.

No, you should not put coffee grounds down the sink.

I have been a coffee drinker for more than 7 years now, but I am still a beginner, because I have been on instant coffee all this while.

I always wanted to explore coffee but somehow other things in life always took priority and I stuck to the instant coffee. 

Recently I got to choose the annual gift from my company where I work. Nespresso CitiZ was one of the options and without doing too much research I opted for it because ""finally, my first coffee machine"". All I knew, before I chose that, was that it works with pods. I thought I'd figure out later which ones to use.

So when I got the machine, I started with Blue Tokai ( Attikan Estate - Medium Dark Roast) pods, I will be honest, I missed my instant coffee and I thought maybe it takes time to switch from a bad coffee to a good coffee. After using finishing up the Tokai pods, I ordered Davidoff ( Ristretto, Espresso57) and then I realised Blue Tokai was better. I have now ordered Nespresso Varierty pack so that I get to understand the different flavours it offers and then figure out my roast and the notes that I may like.

I have it set at 24 clicks (two full rotations plus 4 numbers from my 0) which is supposed to be the upper bound of coarseness for pourover, and my grinds have become very fine (and labour intensive). I'm not sure what the issue could be, but perhaps it could be an issue with reassembly after cleaning, but I'm pretty sure I have followed reassembly instructions to a T.

Here is the supposedly pourover grind coffee. It's a specialty light roast from a local roaster , so the beans are not in question. You can see all the powder that sticks to the bottom of the capture cup, this generally does not happen for coarse grinds. Has this happened to anyone before? I sent a note to 1zpresso, but I don't know how good their technical support is. I'm a little worried I have a lemon on my hands. If anyone has run into this issue and resolved it please let me know!

One last thing, I did notice that during troubleshooting, when I tried to reset the dial back to zero from 24 clicks, the dial would become ""stuck"" in place, but rotating the grinder handle a few times would... tighten something in the grinder (?), and allow me to continue to ratchet the dial back towards 0. I don't think it's leftover coffee in the grinder causing the dial to stop advancing. Any help greatly appreciated!

I've been on a lemon kick lately and saw someone mention making pound cake in an air fryer which seemed kind of random but I had lemons that needed using. Wasn't totally sure how it would turn out since I usually just bake stuff normally, but I figured why not try something different. Anyway, wrote down what I did here if anyone wants to give it a shot: [https://www.platosinolvidables.com/air-fryer-iced-lemon-pound-cake](https://www.platosinolvidables.com/air-fryer-iced-lemon-pound-cake)  
  
Here's what I used:  
  
Lemon Pound Cake:  
  
3/4 cup butter, room temperature, unsalted  
1 cup sugar  
3 large eggs  
1/4 cup sour cream  
3 tablespoons lemon juice  
1 tablespoon lemon zest  
1 teaspoon vanilla extract  
1 1/2 cup all-purpose flour  
1/2 teaspoon baking powder  
1/2 teaspoon baking soda  
1/2 teaspoon salt, (omit if using salted butter  
  
Lemon Icing:  
  
1 cup powdered sugar  
1 tablespoon lemon juice  
2-3 tablespoons milk  
  
Here's how it went:  
  
1. In a large mixing bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until it's nice and fluffy.  
  
2. Slowly add the eggs, sour cream, lemon juice, lemon zest, and vanilla extract. Mix it all together until combined.  
  
3. Mix in the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Don't overmix here, just get it incorporated.  
  
4. Spray your baking pans with olive oil and pour the batter in about 2/3 of the way full. You don't want it overflowing while it cooks.  
  
5. Set the pan into the air fryer and cook at 320 degrees F for 20 minutes on the air fryer setting.  
  
6. When time's up, stick a toothpick in the center to check if it comes out clean. If not, give it another 5 minutes.  
  
7. Let it cool down a bit before you add the icing or it'll just slide right off.  
  
8. For the icing, whisk together the powdered sugar, lemon juice, and milk in a small bowl. Spread it over the cooled cake and you're done.  
  
Few things I noticed while making this:  
  
Pro tip, make sure your butter is actually room temperature before you start. I got impatient once and tried using cold butter and it was a mess to cream properly.  
  
The lemon flavor is pretty bright and tangy which I loved, but if you want it more subtle you could probably dial back the lemon juice a little.  
  
Fair warning, check your cake at the 20 minute mark because air fryers can vary. Mine was perfect but I've heard some run hotter than others.  
  
I made this in mini loaf pans and it worked great. Thinking next time I might try the bundt pan version just to see how it looks for when people come over.  
  
The icing is super simple but it really makes the whole thing. I almost skipped it because I was being lazy but I'm glad I didn't. Adds just enough sweetness without being overwhelming.  
  
Also this was perfect with my morning coffee today, no joke. The texture is dense but still moist, and the lemon keeps it from feeling too heavy.

Here is a screenshot from my latest video where I made CONVERSATION HEARTS Ice Cream. Since this weekend was Valentines I figured what better way to celebrate than with breaking a few hearts lol. I ended up putting all the different flavored candies into a coffee grinder and blended them up into a powder. Overall it was a pretty good flavor that was slightly fruity. I did end up using too much of the candy which resulted in the ice cream having a hard time freezing. But this was definitely a fun experiment.

Hi. Throwaway. Maybe I need to vent. 

This week has been insane. Worst week ever. plus Im trying to post this on reddit to get feedback and have been hit by every mod bet ever. 

I would first like to say I am quality control for a company that manufactures....let's say cookies. Popular cookies. Ive been here 10 years. Its an amazing job. Everyone I work with is great, I've built an strong team and am in management. I take my job seriously. I've been flown on private jets to other states to discuss and inspect. I solved a quality issue 3 states away while 7 months pregnant, carefully crawling to find a screw that was being belted down to find metal leaking into our products, which was failing the metal check point. 

 Im so happy, I've often been compared to as a golden retriever personality. I dont bother  anyone. I love people. high school was great. college awesome. 

 Im 34 and had 3 jobs in my life. One at my dad's mechanic shop, at Disney, and the other here. I have a bachelors in quality control, and I've never been written up or anything. Im a good person and Im so just flabbergasted (Shakira Flabbergasted) by this situation. 

The incident-  On Monday, we had a shipment come in and the quality of the packaging was bad. It had off grime on it and I tried to wipe some scrub off with the iso alcohol. Me and 3 coworkers were just talking about it, examining it. Cue new worker of this year, let's say, Betty. She's really odd but whatever. I helped welcome her aboard. She's like maybe my same age? I dropped off her merch sweatshirt and some other stuff we give to new hires. Im sort of the welcoming committee. Shes quiet. I sort of recongize Im alot so I back off. She's off in the bay watching us. I know this. It was her. We put the iso alcohol in a smaller container. I proceeded to pour some out, rub it on the issue, and nothing happened. Another team member did the same thing. Nothing happened. At this point I was going to reject it. The container is about the same size as my coffee cop and I reached for my coffee and accidently picked up the iso alcohol. Of course I know the difference and there was no handle. I had it half raised to my face. My two team mates laughed. 

This is the only thing I can rationalize- I went (From Trailor Park boys that we all liked) ""Julian!"" And pretended to stumble and hit the wall behind me like the RIP Jim L. We all laughed. I set the container down, grabbed my coffee, signed to reject the order and went on my way. 

30 minutes later Im called into HR. 

I honest to God thought my husband died.  I have never been in trouble anywhere and raced there. Like, maybe one of my team members? I was never in HR. I passed Betty in the hallway and she half smiled, something I know see as a smirk. I raced in. Head of HR, my boss (CEO) and security was there. I was panicked. They explained I had been reported for drinking and being drunk and wanted a drug test/ breathalyzer. It threw me off. I said sure. This is an at will state, whatever. I dont drink anyway. Literaly. i just never have. I think Ive had two beers my whole life and two cigarettes. Hated it. I never got it. 

. All 00.00000 or whatever that works and negative for drugs. My boss seemed relieved then a little mad. I was sent home for the day. Im so confused. 

My boss later came to my home to chat. Betty had reported me for slurring words, being drunk, stumbling, and being 'unethical' and drinking the iso alcohol. Which....wouldnt that kill you??? Betty whos been here one month vs me 10 years reported me for drinking it.

Im furious. Like. I've never been so mad. I've never hated a coworker. This woman tried to ruin my life. Seriously. I was back Wednesday and saw her in the break room and she came and chatted me up like all was okay. ""OMG, how's your kids?""  I went straight to my boss and we went to HR again. I want her written up. I want her not here. Im split on  this but- even if she thought she saw that its so illogical. I feel like it was in bad faith and that she was spreading rumours. False reporting?? 

Our jobs skim eachother as she's the receiving clerk and Im the quality inspector. Thursday and Friday she was teaming me memes and stuff and I ignored all of it. I didnt talk to her. It doesnt help thay Im usually the social engineer and (with my money) bought cards and chocolates for everyone on Friday. I spent time and money making up like 50 cards for everyone. Everyone got one but this woman.  I couldn't bring myself to make one for her. I take pride in what I do and holidays are big. I wrote everyone a cute little letter and gifted them a small box of chocolates. I had extra but couldn't do it. I love people but the fact she really thought I was drinking fucking cleaning alcohol bugs me. I am so professional and put so much energy into being a good quality engineer only for this random to start to talk crap? We are around the same age. So she thought she saw me do a shot of lethal alcohol and immediately get drunk and stumble. We are around the same age and shes not mentally lacking. I know for a fact I straightened myself up and grabbed my real coffee cup and left. Not stumbling. And that little smirk when she passed me while I was rushing to HR, worried something real has happened. She KNEW! Wouldn't alcohol take a minute to take in?

Maybe Im too emotional but my husbands a cop. I always figured if he died in the line of duty my company would be the ones to inform me and let me break down. 

Anyway, she ran to HR to complain of feeling left out. Are you 10? You didnt get a little chocolate and card because no one likes you? You expected a favor from the person your stupid butt thought was drinking chemical alcohol? What's even better is my husband recongized her from a DUI last year. You think a drinker would recongize another. So funny. Your honestly too good for everyone else, Betty. 

Reddit, I need insight. I've never been so furious. Like wtf? And now she wants to be friends? We have Monday off but every fiber of my being wants to schedule her, CEO, and HR meeting and demand one of us must go. Its a bitch move but I have nothing left for her and she needs to go. If they really think she's better then me, Ill happily leave and step up to run my dad's business as he has cancer. 

Can someone break this down? Im sorry. I've never had this situation. 

How do I do the maximum revenge? if I can get her fired, or not? I'm half way tempted to key her car. Im furious. ",3,1771178453.0,AITAH,7,0.8,False

1r5l8f9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITApod/comments/1r5l8f9/aita_for_expecting_kindness_after_getting_my/,AITA for expecting kindness after getting my coworkers’ TONS of food?,"So my coworkers (23 to 40) LOVE this breakfast place. It’s far from our office, but basically right next to my (22m) place. 

The other day they were talking about it, and I mentioned I was a neighbor to the place. They asked me if I could grab their orders some morning bc the place doesn’t do delivery. I said sure, NBD. It’s 5 extra minutes. At that point, I also said throw in my coffee order, (Matcha oat milk latte), and I’ll bring it in!

The next day, they gave me the order, which was fairly large. My coworker texted me the confirmation just now and mentioned how much I owe.

Now, he hasn’t done anything wrong, but I’m a little thrown off that I’m being charged. Yes, it’s only 5 mins extra for me. But I’m probably saving them $10-15 in delivery charges. 

AND I’m doing them a favor. When I do something similar like, “Oh, you’re driving me home rn? What are the odds you grab me some sweet potato fries?) I always would also say ‘ofc i gotchu.” 

So, I really don’t know if it’s worth bringing up. On one hand, if I bring it up now, I sound stingy. On the other hand, I’d be setting the precedent of that, when I do feel if it becomes even a monthly thing I’d want minor compensation in a free coffee. 

The crux of the issue isn’t the $8 right now, it’s IF it became a pattern is it reasonable to want compensation? Once again not a huge deal but I felt like a delivery person enough to feel appreciation in a free coffee would be nice. To give you an idea of the order size, the worker helped me carry some of the stuff to my car. It was two 4-drink cardboard things, and two large bags of food. 

Curious what the best move is, or if the move is nothing if I’m being stingy. Another factor may be that I am relatively new at my workplace.

​Last summer, my partner and I were on a long haul from Yellowstone down to the Redwoods. We were exhausted, burning daylight, and just picked the nearest dot on Google Maps with a cheap motel. That dot was Lakeview, an incredibly isolated little town out in the middle of nowhere.

​We checked into our room, dropped our bags, and headed straight to the local Safeway to grab drinks and snacks. Our plan was to hit the 24/7 Subway on the way back to the motel, as it seemed to be the only place still open in the pitch black.

​At the Safeway checkout, the vibe shifted. The cashier took one look at us and asked, ""You're not from around these parts, are ya?""

​We told her no, we were just passing through. Her expression dropped, she got dead serious, and told us, ""Well, there are two rules here in Lakeview that everyone needs to know:

​DO NOT DRINK THE WATER.
​DO NOT EAT AT THE 24/7 SUBWAY.""

​We forced a nervous laugh, thanked her, and immediately pivoted to buying deli sandwiches instead. The fact that she specifically warned us against the exact Subway we were planning to go to felt less like a coincidence and more like an omen.
​We didn't take any chances. 

We went back to the motel, didn't touch the tap water, skipped our showers, and didn't even use the coffee maker. First thing the next morning, we packed the car and got the hell out of there without looking back.

​Everyone we interacted with was nice enough, but the sheer isolation, the tainted water warning, and whatever dark secret that Subway holds gave us the absolute heebie jeebies.

Looking for advice please (keeping details vague for anonymity).

I work in a Civil Service role where the work is fully laptop-based and can be done remotely. My office location is extremely quiet and often almost empty, with only a small team attending. A lot of people in the team don’t like her since she stepped in November.

I recently requested to work from home during Ramadan (temporary arrangement) due to fasting, commuting time, and needing to be home around iftar/prayer. My previous manager had always supported similar Ramadan requests without issue.

My current manager refused the request and stated that she “can’t support it” and that if she makes allowances for one person then she would have to make allowances for others. She also stated there is nothing in policy requiring flexibility for Ramadan, and didn’t offer any practical alternatives. I was really upset and found articles about being supportive and providing flexibility for Muslim employees. The times clash a bit from when I finish and the commute home, so it would have been much appreciated to work from home for the month. There are no designated prayer rooms either. I just feel like why do I need to justify my self and explain myself to her?. She was asking about commute times etc then just about agreed for me to leave the office early and then make up the time for it after I get home.

There are lots of articles on our intranet regarding supporting, being flexible and understanding of which she hasn’t demonstrated whatsoever.

This has caused me a lot of stress as commuting and office attendance clashes with breaking fast.

Another thing is when she came down to visit, when we were queueing for coffee she made her political views VERY known and it made me feel extremely uncomfortable. She said “Keir Starmer?!! What does he want now? He needs to resign!”. I felt really taken back… what if she’s a reform supporter?.

Separately, I also asked about compressed hours / alternative working patterns and suggested a trial of either:

•	a compressed week (5 days over 4)

•	or a 9 day fortnight

My manager hasn’t formally blocked it, but her response felt discouraging (e.g. “you have the right to request but there is no guarantee”). She also commented that many people are already off on Fridays. I responded that I’m happy to work longer hours / cover business needs and I’m flexible on which day would work best.

What’s also frustrating is that my manager repeatedly says she needs to speak to the Ops Manager about everything, which makes it feel like she isn’t able to make decisions directly and I’m being stalled.

For context, someone else in the wider team (different role/grade) previously had a compressed hours request rejected under a different manager.

Any advice is appreciated, thank you!.",0,1771177778.0,TheCivilService,20,0.3,False

1r5kz58,https://i.redd.it/eyux4sgn4pjg1.png,Token Anxiety,"A friend left a party at 9:30 on a Saturday. Not tired. Not sick. He wanted to get back to his agents.

Nobody questions it anymore. Half the room is thinking the same thing. The other half are probably checking the progress of their agents. At a party.

All the parties are sober now. Young people don't drink because they're going back to work after. Not inspired by Bryan Johnson, although that's probably a factor. The buzz they want now runs on tokens per day.

I keep noticing it on walks through the Mission. Laptops glowing everywhere. Cafes, sidewalks, heck even park benches. People walking with screens open like a flashlight guiding them somewhere. Less drunk laughter on the streets these days. More keystrokes.

Dinner conversations used to start with ""what are you building?"" That's over. Now it's ""how many agents do you have running?"" People drop the number the way they used to drop their follower count. Quietly competitive. The flex isn't what you've accomplished anymore. It's what's working while you're sitting here not working.

The vocabulary is what really gets me though. People describe models the way sommeliers describe wine. This one has better taste. That one hallucinates with more confidence. Opus is bold, Codex is smooth. They talk about harnesses and reins like they're controlling horses. Invisible whips directing invisible labor. Someone at a dinner said they keep ""Claude on a tight leash for code review but give it more slack for creative work."" We've started borrowing the language of how we treat animals for something none of us actually understand yet.

Waking up and checking what your agents produced overnight is the first thing now. Before coffee. Before texts. You open your laptop and grade homework you assigned in your sleep. Some of it is good. Most needs rework. But you start shipping a plan before you sleep just so you can wake up to more code written overnight. Saturdays became uninterrupted build windows. No meetings, no Slack, twelve hours of you and your agents. Sunday morning X is all terminal screenshots and shipping receipts. ""What'd you ship this weekend?"" replaced ""what'd you do this weekend?""

The anxiety is rational, which is why it sticks. Every week some new benchmark drops that makes last month's workflow feel prehistoric. Codex ships overnight processing. Opus gets faster. Context windows double. None of it reduces the pressure. It multiplies it. You can do more now. And someone already is. The window to be first at anything feels like it's shrinking by the day. Literally, by the day.

I replaced Netflix with Claude Code. I lie in bed thinking about what I can spin up before I fall asleep, what can run while I'm unconscious. Reading a novel feels indulgent now. Watching a movie without a laptop open feels wasteful. This voice in my head that says ""something could be running right now"" just doesn't shut off. I'm not even building a company. I'm just addicted to building my random ideas.

Everyone here knows they should step away more. That's not the problem. The problem is what your brain does when you try. I still take [aimless walks.](https://writing.nikunjk.com/p/a-random-walk) The agents come with me now.",1,1771177750.0,AIMain,0,1.0,False

Looking for recommendations for decent baby changing facilities in Aberdeen city!

  
I've been to Union Square's upstairs family room. But found it too busy and I'm not confident in breastfeeding in front of people yet. It also felt very bizarre changing next to so many other parents. Especially when my child screamed the place down and everyone else was silent.

  
I have also tried Sainsbury's Garthdee changing, it was a perfect set up with changing area, cubicle for adults, seat for breastfeeding all in one locked private room!

  I see why people had trouble with this one, but it is quit a diverse coffee and have made a lot of good cups from it. Not rested the flavors will be too intense. Also a stronger extracted it's too bitter and a gentle/low one its pretty citric, so there is a window for it to taste good and structured. It did work with my standard style and found no need to tinker though I did with some cups. After brewing different methods I landed on these two brews/brewers as I feel they compliment the coffee well and bring out nuance without overwhelming with the punch it could have.

its funny because when we first moved in, the door was a burgundy color and now I’m painting it back to a red palette.

  
the red door is when we first moved in. I tried pink and immediately regretted it - barely got one coat on. then I painted it a teal color.. and now a blue. 

  
(ignore the taupe color behind the two red swatches. I was initially going to try a neutral but found it to be a bit boring.) in the first photo, I have the two options! left is rumors and right is divine wine. rumors looks more raspberry and divine wine looks to have more of a purple undertone.

I spend a lot of time working at coffee shops. I really enjoy the atmosphere of a little background noise, potential to cross paths with random people & just vibe. (Week nights open late would be amazing, but stl doesn’t really accommodate for this type of environment to just chill  at a coffee shop/similar late at night. Not particularly interested in working on my laptop at a bar— so i often resort to bread co)

Specifically while there i work on my laptop. I’m curious which coffee shop(s) in St. Louis are the most tuned for social + work + open week nights ideally to like 9 pm or later

-Upshot the one in st Charles is pretty fun but sometimes is cold at times and seems slightly more tuned for social & eating. The seats aren’t necessarily enticing for meeting others.

-23 west is very pretty inside and a good environment to work, but less focused on the social part.

-coma coffee is a bit more layed out for social but honestly found the baristas to talk very inappropriately & kinda had a bad taste from it

There’s some deeper in the city but i haven’t taken the risk to drive out there for it to be a flop, any recommendations would be great

I’ve been kinda discouraged by the lack of options here.  I’m surprised there hasn’t been more of a goal to open spaces like this, given most in their 20s rent, and to go out with friends casually, this would be a great cheap way to do it
(Also i mean duh i could do Starbucks, but people don’t really gather there like they do non franchise)

1r5kpi9,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueChristian/comments/1r5kpi9/future_wife/,Future Wife?,"Hey guys, So I (22M) had the following 4 dreams that I suspect points to my future wife.

  
In the first dream, I seemed to be in my (maybe) early thirties, I had a crazy hairstyle, was also much buffer. In that dream, I saw a beautiful woman (let's call her woman x), lying down on a bench while my mum sat on a chair talking to her. 

In the next scene, I was sitting up on the right side of a large bed in a master bedroom, then woman x was lying on the bed left of me, and we were both listening to my mum while she sat on a chair beside the bed. Another scene was were i saw her walking in front of me, and I could see her whole backside and how tall she was (almost my height, I'm 6ft). But not once did I see her face throughout the dream.

Also in that dream I saw that America was moving a MASSIVE fleet across the atlantic, I got the impression that tensions were building up for something like a world war (I'm not American).

  
In the second dream, I saw the same woman, I was younger, but so was she. she was wearing an office wear white shirt and black trousers. She was in my office standing in front of me. In another scene, she was sitting very close to me and serving me coffee. Then the dream diverts to me complaining about my mum treating my younger brother better than me LOL.

  
In the third dream, I had a question about God and started asking people that i know, I went to church in that dream to ask my pastor the same question. as I was walking to the altar, I saw the same woman with her friends walking from the altar.  but I automatically stopped her and started a conversation.

Me: Hey you look like \[an actress name\] 

Her: Is she a good actress 

Me: No, I hate her. 

We talked a little more that I couldn't remember. In the dream, I instinctively reached out my hand to hold hers, she pushed it back and said ""no, we'll talk later"". and she left back to her friends. I stared at her as she ran back, then continued with the rest of my dream thinking nothing of it. 

But when I woke up, DAMN did it occupy my mind. I also saw her face but can only somewhat remember such that If I see her, I'll immediately recognize her. That's also when it started to really really dawn on me that I may be seeing my future wife.

In the fourth dream, I was dating a different woman planning to marry her, but then I heard a voice saying: That is not your wife, do you not know how your wife looks like? then I saw the same woman (woman x) i've been seeing in my dreams, she sat on a traditional stool beside me wearing traditional wedding attire belonging to an eastern tribe from my country. and in that dream I lost my breath/choked from how beautiful she looked that I woke up.

 I prayed to God the next day to confirm it, and that night in my dream, I just saw ""She's your wife"" written with white text on a black screen just before I woke up. 

This last dream is similar to a dream I had where a similar text format was used by God to inform me I have a project to work on for his kingdom, which I'm working on now.

But sometimes I do dislike like the feeling of not knowing, like I do envy people that can just start dating a girl when they feel they are ready. I seem to know a lot of things about this girl, like her complexion, her face, her culture, her height, her build and all that even though I've never met her. But most importantly I don't know the time whether 5 years, or 10 years from now, and that kills me sometimes. Also I do catch myself daydreaming about her. So any advice can help would help, thanks.

Pretty sure God showed me my future wife, and I need advice on how not to worry that I may have to wait very long.",1,1771177133.0,TrueChristian,1,1.0,False
1r5kowq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1r5kowq/6_months_married_constant_arguing_do_we_divorce/,"6 months married, constant arguing. Do we divorce?","I (26f) and husband (32f) got married 6 months ago. Prior to that, we were dating for a little under two years and we were long distance, but made effort to see each other when we could. For reference, I lived in the midwest and he lived in the deep south. I’m also from a culture where men and women can’t live together until getting married, so we only moved in together once we got married. And what’s where the issues started. 

We had our first argument a week after I moved in with him, and it over me being homesick and missing my family back home. I was overwhelmed and I was taking it out on him, and finding the smallest things to be upset about. I even told him, “I hate that you brought me here,” and we ended up talking about ways to help me integrate into this new city/state and new life. 

Then, a few weeks later, I noticed he still followed women from the nightclub scene (aka strippers and SWs) back in the day when he was a bouncer. I made it clear early on when we got engaged that one of my strictest boundaries was not having single men and women on our social media that made the other uncomfortable. The thing about the two women he was following that upset me the most was that he told me both would flirt with him, but he never cared to make a move or to sleep with them. But like…it’s a respect thing. Whatever. We argued about that and he ended up unfollowing the women. 

The next argument was over finances. I was 20k in debt in my early 20s (traveling and shopping habits; I landed a 75k job right out of college and I went crazy), and I worked hard to get out of it. But I lost my job due to layoffs shortly after moving in with him, and I had to put expenses on my credit card and he found out. We sat and talked about finances and he said he couldn’t trust me to manage my finances on my own, and when I landed a job again, he would sit down and manage my money for me until I could learn to do it by myself. We argued about that, and I told him he was acting like a father. 

The biggest thing we’ve constantly been arguing over is me adjusting to my new life here. I had a strong friendship that fell through 2 years ago due to drama, and since then, I’ve found it hard to get close to other girls and maintain healthy friendships. I honestly get tired of hanging out with people, and I feel like everyone is a vampire draining my energy. I’m an introvert, I guess. My ex-best friend and I had more of a sisterhood than a friendship, and I told my husband I feel like I won’t ever replace that or find another girl who is like that with me. All that to say, he’s been introducing me to his friends’ wives and girlfriends, and encouraging me to hang out with them here. I’ve been a good sport and hung out several times with these girls, but it feels so artificial and fake, and I don’t have much in common with them. I told my husband I don’t want to hang out with these girls anymore, but I’ll be cordial in group or couple settings. He got upset and told me I can be miserable alone and that I need friends, and he was insulting me in every single way.

The day before Valentine’s Day (this past Friday), three of the girls invited me out for a galentine’s day dinner, and I did NOT want to go. I literally dreaded it and I was complaining to him nonstop the entire time I was getting ready. He told me to have a good time and be positive about it, and to be fair, I tried to have a good time once we got to the restaurant. But I was zoning out of every single conversation and to make it worse, the food wasn’t even that great. I paid for my meal, say my goodbyes, and came home. I was in a bad mood and that was the precursor to our valentine’s day. 

I fell asleep on the couch and he fell asleep in our bedroom, and I was grumpy Saturday morning. I slept in until about 1pm and he woke up around 11:30 and left the house after getting ready. I didn’t check to see where he was going. I was just emotionally drained. I woke up later and made myself some coffee, and he came in and was asking why I was mad at him and why I was in a shitty mood. I told him to stop forcing me to do things I don’t want to do, and to hang out with people I have no desire to hang out with or to get to know. He called me a loser and told me to spend my life miserable. He left the house and came back in moments later with chocolates and flowers, and he threw them onto the coffee table and said “Thanks for ruining Valentine’s Day.” 

We had plans for a couple’s dinner later that night at a nice restaurant, and I told him to cancel the reservations. He called me names, and told me to leave if life with him is “so bad”. He said he would get the divorce papers on Monday, and he told me to get my shit and get out. I said, “No, I’m not doing that,” and we basically spent the rest of valentine’s day in the house, away from each other, and we didn’t say a word. He told me later that night that I ruined our first valentine’s day as a married couple. I was on social media checking everyone’s stories, and it made me angry to see everyone out and about, posting extravagant flowers and gifts, and we posted nothing. Even the flowers he got me were sad. 

I’m not making myself out to be an angel or saint here at all, but I also don’t know what to do. We have so much in common and we’re great together. But ever since getting married, it’s all gone downhill and I don’t like it at all.

Blank screen.

No bars. No Netflix.

Just me and my life choices.

But hey, my room was warm, small, gently rocking. The engines settled into their low cathedral hum. The swell lifted us.

The winter light unspooled into darkness.

I was planning to work.

Instead, I slept. I slept up the east coast of Calvert Island, I slept through Bella Bella, Milbanke Sound and into the northern night beyond Klemtu and Hartley Bay.

I slept like an old man in front of the television, mouth open, glaze-eyed, fully surrendered. Only there was no television.

Somewhere in that 22-hour glide north, something had whispered, ""Relax, spreadsheet man."" So I did.

The coast does not care about my productivity. It has been here for millennia.

It measures time in tides. Not TikTok. Not texts. Not Netflix.

By the time we eased into the grey drizzle of Rupert at 9:30 a.m., I still hadn't typed a single word.

But I stepped onto that wet north coast pavement with the slow, steady gait of a well-rested mammal who remembered something important:

You don't move through this coast. It moves through you.

And if you're lucky, it rearranges you a little on the way.

In academia, it's like I see a connection that others are very,  very confused as to how I came to that conclusion.  To me, it's obvious? But I guess not? 

With family, especially older,  I think there's an added issue of being treated like the child they know I used to be.

1r5kkvs,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucksbaristas/comments/1r5kkvs/tall_rant/,Tall rant,"1. The fact we actually can't stock pastries out temporarily, esp with using in stock but not ready option is beyond unhelpful. I understand that we are graded on our food stock and that pulling any extras we need early in the morning is optimal. But what's the point of a button if we can't use it??

2. Customers need to actually specify what size of the drink they want and if it's hot or cold, because I shouldn't have to ask 20 questions every single time. 

3. Starbucks, if you want us to not double cup Americanos, teas, and hot coffees, MAKE BETTER INSULATED CUPS THAT CAN WITHSTAND LIQUID WITHOUT FOLDING. McDonald's has superior hot drink cups. There's no excuse why we shouldn't have similar built cups. Having thin cups that are barely insulated is an absolute safety risk.

4. Limit customizations on drinks. Since time metrics across the board are so significant to y'all, you need to put some sort of cap on how many customizations on a drink you can apply. 

5. Customers who do 1/2"" milk and extra other milk along with extra ice for cold brews or iced coffee... Are you sure you don't want a latte or an iced milk at that point? How am I supposed to fit any of that into our cups? Please think about what you're ordering. 

If it sounds like I'm pissed, yeah maybe I am a little bit peeved. Frustrated is probably the apt word for me in this case. I enjoy working here but, some things drive me a little crazy. ",3,1771176828.0,starbucksbaristas,0,1.0,False

1r5kinf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1r5kinf/am_i_being_observee/,Am I being observee ?,"the situation:

Im a male not a female. 

I walked from my address to get a sandwich at the sandwich shop I eat almost everyday for 2/3 years. It was Sunday and there was no one there. A little later 30 mins before closing time, the man in question entered through the two glass doors at the back of shop which I know isnt an entrance. I was also sitting on the chairs near those back doors, at the rear of the restaurant.

I have been coming there daily for 2–3 years and I know that this is not an entrance — the entrance is the green side door. So that does not suggest he is a regular customer or someone who comes there often, or ever.

The man I described ordered a coffee. When the waitress brought it to him, he looked over his shoulder at me once. Then he pushed the cappuccino forward and did not take a single sip.

He was sitting diagonally opposite me with his back toward me, on his phone. I saw that he was not doing anything in particular. He was acting strangely with his phone — every three seconds he seemed to look at something else, something pointless. I did not see him doing anything purposeful on his phone.

He did not take a sip of the coffee, and during the time I was there eating my sandwich, I did not see him touch the cup once. The coffee must have gone cold anyway.

He picked up the menu but appeared to only look at the left side of it, possibly to look at me from the corner of his eye.

When I finished my sandwich and stood up, he suddenly seemed to be on the phone with someone — either calling someone or already on a call. I then took a different route and made a detour.

2 Days later same shop:

I took the bus to the city from my home to mail an envelope. I took a detour to the city center to eat a sandwich at the shop. I deliberately walked a longer route. I saw a vague, slim man on the other side of the sidewalk — as described above — who stared at me for a long time, and I looked back at him.

I completed my loop and arrived around half an hour earlier and ordered a sandwich and a cappuccino. Shortly afterward, I saw the same man who had stared at me enter the back of the restaurant (the front is for ordering and takeaway, and if you walk around, there is a small restaurant area where you can eat).

apparantely, he had already ordered, and he positioned himself on the same chair and in the same spot as the man who had also been there on Sunday acting suspiciously. He seemed nervous and I did not trust his behavior.

I drank my coffee, walked outside to the takeaway side, went back in, and decided to take the sandwich with me instead.

Once outside, I walked a loop around the city center. When I was near the flower shop, I suddenly encountered him again. He looked at me and nodded with a friendly grin on his face.

This made me extra alert, and I went to stand somewhat out of the way next to another store with my back to a wall and observed the surroundings.



After that, I took another detour through the grocery store, via the parking lot near the ATM, through parkinglots that are private, toward another area (about 500 meters further). Then the same man approached me again on the same sidewalk. I was on the left side of the sidewalk, he was on the right.

For a second, he seemed like he wanted to step toward me and looked at me again, but after about half a second he corrected himself, nodded at me again, and walked on. I do not know in which direction.

I made it home safely, but something does not feel right.

1. How far along were you into your 'pericarditis journey' before you were put on **arcalyst or anakinra**? With what elements did you manage to get it prescribed (crp, mri, ecg, etc) ?

***-> Especially if you’re from or living in Paris/France, who and how did you finally get it prescribed?***

How do you feel on it, especially if you had other medical history before pericarditis whatsoever (like rhinitis or allergies, endometriosis, ibs, etc) ?

2. While having pericarditis, have some of you been put on Venlafaxine (effexor), or Duloxetine (Cymbalta), or any of the **antidepressants** that have a special effect on pain too? Did it help?

3. For those of you who've tried neuroplasticity / naturopathy / auriculotherapy or any other more **natural approach**, how was it / has it helped?

4. For those who've been 'cleared' (normal mri and other tests, etc) but still experienced the same symptoms (pain, fatigue, shortness of breath etc), have you eventually progressively increased **physical activity** or even **sport**? If so, has it helped?

5. Do you guys tolerate small amounts of **coffee**, like one cup a day? Not sure where to stand on this one, I have tried with and without and it's basically all the same to me, not feeling that much better without it though, but anyways....

1r5kgyc,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1r5kgyc/im_f24_thinking_of_ending_things_with_my/,"Im (F24) thinking of ending things with my boyfriend (M22) after 3 years, how can I go about it?","Alright, so for some backstory, we have been together for 3 years and we met through simple texting on social media, he was always very sweet and very funny and insisted on taking care of me and helping me with anything (financial, emotional etc.) however in the last 2 years or so I have noticed many habits of his (mostly cleaning related) that have begun to wear me down. For reference I am not the most perfect person when it comes to cleaning, I am no stranger to a few dishes in the sink or some trash on the coffee table. It is important to note here that I live separately from him in my own place. However his place tends to be unbearable for me most of the time, there is always trash everywhere, mostly soda cans and takeout trash both paper and plastic. There are often crumbs and generally dirt on his floor most of the time and he doesnt seem to notice it or care about it. The biggest problem is that his dishes had gone not done for more than 3 months, we had nothing to eat with, no silverware, so we would eat out constantly and then that trash would pile up and nothing would be done about it. I have cleaned his place MANY times and made it look and feel like a home, but he has recently told me that it makes him feel incredibly bad when I do this, he has stated ""you shouldnt have to clean my place for me, it makes me feel incapable and dirty"" so I stopped. But the conditions of his place has severely deteriorated and every time I go over I am overwhelmed with how messy and cluttered it is.  The reason this decision is so difficult for me is due to his mental health and financial status. He makes less money than I do, and his rent is more than mine so he often has significantly less money than me, but he is not the best at saving money either, so when he does have extra he tends to spend it on unnecessary things such as fast food, soda, or games. His mental health is also not in the best shape, he has been in a depressive episode for the last year or so and this is one of the main causes behind why his place has gotten so dirty and why he lacks any motivation to do anything about it. I feel sympathy for him so greatly it hurts, I want him to be mentally well and able to take care of himself but I cannot fathom my future being with someone who lives this way. We recently had a huge argument about this and we almost broke up on the spot but he promised to clean his dishes and clean his apartment and be better and seek therapy. It has not been that long since this argument but little to no progress has been made, He did about half of the dishes that needed to be done, has called off of work to ""lock in and clean"" but instead choosing to sort his gaming consoles and going through his t-shirts, rather than sweep the floor or wipe down surfaces. He is fully aware that there is a mouse or multiple mice and has done nothing about this just hoping his cat will get them. I am worried about warm weather returning because his place often has cockroaches. He is trying to get his life back in shape but I cant help but feel it was only to prevent me leaving and soon he will return to his habits and I do not wish to remain in a relationship with someone like this. The only reason I am posting this is because I am afraid. If i leave this relationship I worry that he will only continue downhill and spiral even further, he has had incidents like this in the past with older relationships. I understand it is not my responsibility to help him but I feel such a deep love for him, I always have, he is my best friend! I just cannot stand the way he lives anymore and for my own mental health I cannot be around that environment. I dont want to break his heart but i know there is no future in this relationship. I am aware of this. thanks for reading if you did, any support or advice on how i go about this is appreciated.",1,1771176571.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

1r5kgw6,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_proxy_chef/comments/1r5kgw6/vday_celebration/,V-Day Celebration,"V-Day has come and gone. However it’s one of my favorite days to celebrate my wife. She doesn’t too much care for it. However I do any chance to celebrate my love for her and show it I love it. 

I started by making her breakfast in bed with her favorite flowers. She loves yellow roses and french toast sticks, with grits and eggs and her favorite morning workout shake. I gave her a card too she read it and just smiled gave me a kiss. Rubbed her feet she then got in the shower I got in with her and I washed her hair and her body from top to bottom didn’t let her lift a finger. She got out and I dried her off and rubbed lotion all over her.  Picked out her gym clothes she got dress and I tied her shoes. Walked her to her car. 

I immediately started cleaning up the house. I got some more flowers and set up her lunch which was fresh fruits and vegetables and salad. She came home from the gym and made a stop for coffee and some light shopping I reimbursed her. Which she ate lunch I rubbed her feet and shoulder told her how much I love and adore her. She got back in the shower and I repeated the process from earlier except this time she made me wash her with a strawberry banana scent and not a strawberry raspberry scent. 

I picked out her some evening clothes and she laid down for a nap. I cuddled her for a bit kissing her back and just holding her and it’s make me insanely horny she doesn’t not allow me to do anything sexual. While cuddling she was complaining my pre-cum was all over her back. However I can’t help it she’s insisting on this waiting period. 

She wanted to go out with her girls for the evening. So I picked out her some clothes. I wanted her to wear this pink dress however she said no.

I lose interest in things and pass by them quite often, and sometimes it's a little upsetting, because I know I won't be able to finish the things I planned now that my  obsession has withered away.

But with uni? it's so much more devastating, because I still care, except now it doesn't manifest itself as an incessant obsession and compulsive grade counting. it's just debilitating anxiety.

I was the epitome of a high achiever in my first year, I ended the year with a GPA of 4.95. An A was the lowest mark I had.

I still didn't get into med school(the way I expected) despite that and I think that messed with me a little. 

I applied to a different paid med school and I got in, but I couldn't put the guilt of having my mom pay for me behind me, it was eating me up so I went back to the major I got accepted into, Pharm D.

I really do like this major, genuinely, but sometimes I'll look back at the amount of effort I'm exerting and think I could've been doing it for a better paying job instead. Even though I chose this.

There's also the part where I have to be exceptional in this major, it's not the same as with medschool where you just have to pass(I know that's still difficult, but you know what I mean. There's no threshold I can place for myself that I'd be satisfied with beyond ""the best"").

I used to put in an insane amount of effort to where I would be able to recite entire lectures from memory before my exam. I made anki flashcards for everything (big waste of time but it was undeniable how well it worked).

The biggest issue is I don't have the energy for memorization anymore. 

I think ochem might have broke me a little, my first C+, it brought me back to earth I guess. I was so incredibly tired near the end of the previous semester, and the exhaustion seems intent on following me around even now.

1r5kcd6,https://www.reddit.com/r/MenAscending/comments/1r5kcd6/the_psychology_of_procrastination_why_your_brain/,The Psychology of Procrastination: Why Your Brain Avoids Hard Tasks (Science-Based),"so i've been nerding out on neuroscience and psychology lately, falling down rabbit holes about why we're all such chronic procrastinators. turns out it's not because we're lazy or broken. it's literally how our brains are wired, and modern life is basically designed to mess with our dopamine system.

i've spent months reading research papers, listening to neuroscience podcasts, watching lectures from Stanford and other universities. the tldr? your brain is constantly choosing easy dopamine hits over delayed rewards. but here's the good news, once you understand the mechanics, you can actually game your own system.

your brain on instant gratification

every time you pick your phone over that project deadline, your brain isn't being stupid. it's being efficient. checking instagram gives you instant dopamine. starting that difficult task? your brain sees effort, uncertainty, and a reward that's hours or days away.

Dr. Andrew Huberman (neuroscientist at Stanford) explains this perfectly on his podcast. when you engage in high dopamine activities constantly (scrolling, gaming, porn, whatever), you're basically raising your dopamine baseline. suddenly normal activities feel boring and unrewarding. you need bigger hits to feel okay. it's like dopamine inflation.

the problem compounds because modern tech companies literally employ neuroscientists to make their apps as addictive as possible. you're not weak willed, you're up against billion dollar algorithms designed to hijack your reward system.

why hard tasks feel physically painful

there's actual science behind why starting difficult work feels like pushing a boulder uphill. your anterior cingulate cortex (the part that processes effort and conflict) literally lights up when you're about to do something challenging. your brain interprets this as a threat signal.

so you're sitting there, assignment open, feeling this weird discomfort. that's not laziness. that's your brain saying ""this is hard and the reward is uncertain, maybe check tiktok instead?""

the key insight from behavioral psychology research is that this discomfort peaks right before you start, then drops dramatically once you're actually doing the thing. but most people never push through that initial resistance.

breaking the cycle (stuff that actually works)

reframe dopamine peaks strategically. Dr. Anna Lembke from Stanford wrote [""Dopamine Nation""](https://www.amazon.com/Dopamine-Nation-Finding-Balance-Indulgence/dp/152474672X) and it genuinely changed how i think about rewards. she talks about dopamine fasting, not in the stupid tech bro way, but actually limiting high dopamine activities before doing hard work. don't scroll instagram then immediately try to study. you've already peaked your dopamine, everything else feels worse in comparison. instead, do boring tasks first, let your baseline drop, then hard work becomes relatively more rewarding.

the 5 minute rule but make it dumber. forget motivation. your brain is never going to ""feel like it"" so stop waiting. set a timer for 5 minutes and commit to being actively bad at the task. not good, not productive, literally just show up and suck at it for 5 minutes. write terrible sentences. make ugly slides. this removes the perfectionism block and 90% of the time you'll keep going because starting is genuinely the only hard part.

there's an app called Goblin Tools that helps break tasks into absurdly small steps. sounds gimmicky but it works because it removes the cognitive load of figuring out where to start.

manipulate your environment like you're your own employee. James Clear covers this extensively in [""Atomic Habits""](https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break/dp/0735211299) (massively popular book, millions sold, genuinely useful). make hard tasks easier to start and distractions harder to access. this sounds obvious but most people don't actually do it. delete social apps during work hours. use website blockers. put your phone in another room. leave your gym clothes out the night before.

your future self has the same garbage willpower as current you, so rig the game in their favor.

understand dopamine scheduling. this is from research on operant conditioning. if you reward yourself after every small task completion, you're training your brain that hard work leads to good feelings. but here's the catch, the reward needs to be proportional and immediate. finished a difficult section? take a 10 minute walk, make good coffee, whatever. don't finish 3 hours of deep work then reward yourself with 4 hours of youtube. you're teaching your brain the wrong lesson.

acceptance and commitment therapy perspective. there's a book called [""The Confidence Gap""](https://www.amazon.com/Confidence-Gap-Guide-Overcoming-Self-Doubt/dp/1590309235) by Russ Harris (he's a therapist who specializes in ACT). the core idea is you're never going to eliminate the discomfort of doing hard things, but you can change your relationship with that discomfort. stop treating it as a stop sign and start treating it as information. ""oh i feel resistance, that means this matters and i'm growing.""

sounds like therapy speak but it genuinely helps when you stop waiting for tasks to feel easy.

if you want something more engaging than reading all these books and papers, there's this personalized learning app called [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) that pulls from behavioral psychology research, neuroscience books, and expert insights to create audio content tailored to what you're actually struggling with. built by a team from columbia and google, it lets you type in your specific challenge like ""stop procrastinating as someone with ADHD"" and generates podcasts from quality sources at whatever depth you want, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives.

you can also customize the voice, some people swear by the sarcastic narrator to make dense psychology more digestible. it's basically a more structured way to absorb all this research without the overwhelming rabbit holes, and it keeps evolving based on what clicks for you. decent replacement for mindless scrolling when your brain needs stimulation but you want something that actually sticks.

micro workouts for your prefrontal cortex. your ability to do hard things is literally a muscle. start small. do one pushup. write one sentence. the goal isn't productivity, it's proving to your brain that you can do things you don't feel like doing. this builds what psychologists call self efficacy, basically trust in yourself.

the Insight Timer app has good quick meditations for focus. not the woo woo stuff, but actual attention training exercises backed by cognitive research.

track inputs not outcomes. stop measuring yourself by results and start measuring effort. did you show up? did you try? that's what you control. your brain loves tracking progress, so give it something to track that isn't dependent on external factors. use a habit tracker, mark off days you attempted the thing, build streaks.

the bigger picture

look, we're all living in an environment our brains weren't designed for. constant stimulation, infinite novelty, zero boredom. your ancestors didn't have to compete with professionally designed dopamine slot machines in their pockets.

but biology isn't destiny. yeah your dopamine system is getting hijacked, but neuroplasticity means you can literally rewire these patterns. it just takes understanding the mechanics and being strategic about it.

the chronic procrastination isn't a character flaw, it's a mismatch between your stone age brain and a digital world. once you stop fighting your biology and start working with it, things get easier. not easy, but easier.",1,1771176270.0,MenAscending,0,1.0,False

1r5k9ov,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r5k9ov,DFW-LHR & Return Positive Experience - ADA accommodations & staff,"Recently flew AA20/21 for a board meeting & workshop.

DFW Admiral's Club was pretty quiet and comfortable and really that's all I need.  I can't do large crowds.  I have a fractured L4/L5 and cerebral palsy so I just need a comfortable place away from people and a power outlet.

I was seated in 12D next to some annoying influencer who thought it'd be a good idea to do video tips on facial masks on a plane—engagement bait arms race, I guess—but it didn't bother me.  As soon as I threw on my DT770s I was half asleep (not impressed with the $60 B&O cans; they didn't work on either leg, and the replacements weren't much better; but I'm picky—home recording studio—and the B&Os are low impedance... probably won't bother the average traveler).

I slept an entire 3-3.5 hours which for me is typical, so that's a first because I enjoy flying and so I've never actually fallen asleep on a plane before.

I made the mistake of not asking for assistance on the DFW-LHR leg... getting out of customs at Heathrow is a VERY long walk.  **If you have any kind of mobility challenge whatsoever, please don't be afraid to ask for assistance if you need it.**

On the return flight, LHR Admiral's Club was similarly quiet except for my fellow Indian-American family.   I was getting a weirdly endearing delight out of watching a younger version of me growing up in a more affluent family—let's call him Indian Carlton.  Indian Carlton was nerding out with his sister while I gorged on three plates of pork sausage and eggs, some coffee and I skipped the bar knowing I would be having my customary libation on the plane—we'll come back to that in a second because it's the best part of the story.

So after the VIP/CK whatever passengers get boarded, I get situated in 4A pretty quickly, throw on my cans and my inflight entertainment (Robocop NC-17 edition; you really don't realize just how gory this movie is until you watch it on a plane suddenly thinking about who might be looking over your shoulder when Toxic Emil gets splattered all over the hood of that 6000 SUX, but I digress...).

I have a double gin rocks after takeoff. At some point they bring out the fabled short rib... It's airline food.  It's fine.  Everyone has their own opinion.  I just don't expect much out of airline food, so I have no complaints.

Enter the marvelous character of a flight attendant...  A cross between Mercedes Ruehl, Patty and/or Selma from The Simpsons and the loud nurse in John Mulaney's Batman sketch, she's got serious ""OK WE ARE DOING THIS, PEOPLE"" energy.

And this is where the inflight experience goes from good to ""holy shit, this could be a scene in The Studio"" ... Patty Mercedes Batman comes over to take my second drink order and it's always the same as the first—double gin rocks, straight.

Patty Mercedes Batman looks at me and asks, ""You don't mix this with anything?""

Me, ""No, just straight gin. That's all.""

Without skipping a beat, her voice drops an octave or two in an Elaine Benes sort of way, and she just looks down her glasses at me and deadpans, ""Really,"" and she pours away with a hint of disgust.

Patty Mercedes Batman, wherever you are, thank you.  That was the funniest sh\*t ever and made my day after a very long, very exhausting week!

**footnote:** Arrival in DFW went smoothly.  This time gate personnel could see I had issues and asked if I needed assistance. I said yes, and they got me to customs quickly.  I'm Global Entry cleared so it took all of a few seconds and then they helped me to baggage where I could get a cart for my carry on and checked bags.

Some background-

Growing up, we went through some traumatic shit with family members. We had each other and bonded over that shared understanding that nearly everyone in our family is a little fucked up and crazy and physically/enotionally abusive. My mom is a textbook narc and very emotionally immature. But me and twin - we saw each other and got rlly close. No one knows what those experiences felt like but each other. So that added this layer to our relationship. It’s maybe why I excuse certain shit she does or says.

I used to be pretty depressed as a kid for years even. There would be these times where she would act and behave really shitty to me. Like for example recording me on snap when I really really did not want to be recorded  and get the camera in my face and tease me. Then send it to our cousins who she was closer to. Made me feel like an outcast. Which made me feel 10x worse. It felt like public humiliation. I knew it was wrong but we still kinda had that close friendship. It didn’t affect it, we went on like usual. I took it basically. These shitty times were really not often.

A few years ago, when we became adults, I told her how it made me feel. She was instantly defensive and minimized it all. Labelled me as forever having a victim complex and I exaggerate things and can do no wrong person. This was maybe 2 conversations. I let it go because I didn’t wanna escalate to our usual screaming matches (there would be 3-4 times yearly where we have a fight about something and we won’t talk for a day or two then go back to being besties).

Everytime we have a big fight, like clockwork; verbally attack, cuss me out, tell others misconstrued versions of the event and get them to side with her. Clockwork. Which by the way they do side with her because they say we want her to just stop so we become agreeable. Whatever. Im guilty of being agreeable to keep the peace as well so they can’t be blamed.

Anyway recently I kinda fckd up her coffee order but giving 3 vanilla pumps but not 1. She flipped. Like insanely so. Over coffee. She cussed me out over text messages calling me a “fucking bitch and a fucking idiot and that she’s literally gonna cry omfg” —- lmfao…someone sure does love dunkin! I was definitely the asshole for what I did next - I screenshotted and sent that to my siblings group chat which she is in.

She texted me saying she’ll block me and tell our family one of my secrets (I wanna be vague but it’s a matter of religion) anyway I’d definitely be kicked out if that got out to them no doubt about it. I was floored. Over coffee???? I got some advice on this app from others saying to spin a story to parent about how I lost my way but found the light. Which I just did two hours ago. They believed me, I showed them the threats of what twin said to me, they were shocked. Im glad I took reddits advice and got ahead of that situation. It seems im safe now but we’ll see I guess. Anyway this is unforgivable truly. I’ll never forgive her I think. This is unlike any situation we previously had. She literally went and stooped so low. I can’t do my usual routine and forgive anymore. This is my safety she’s playing with. Any advice on how to coexist with her for one more year? Again I cannot move out and she isnt either.

1r5k6ca,https://www.reddit.com/r/limerence/comments/1r5k6ca/half_the_story/,Half the Story,"A little over two years ago I started to feel limerent for a woman I had known for a couple of years. She ticked all the boxes for me. She was physically attractive, good fun, outgoing, just a lovely personality. 

I felt myself thinking more and more about her over the period of 6 months or so. We were both members of a group which met once or twice a week  socially. I found myself looking forward to seeing her there and when I couldn't attend due to holidays or other commitments, I'd miss her. That's when I noticed that my mind was concentrated on her a lot of the time. Around that time I became aware of limerance and found this sub on Reddit. 

I well understand the overwhelming power that being limerent can have on someone. It grows and grows until almost every waking hour and possibly a few sleeping hours over time are filled with thoughts of the LO. It's intense. 

I started to develop a romantic interest in her. The more time I spent around her the greater that urge grew. We always met when there were other people around but sometimes we got to speak one to one. I loved her company. We started to share personal things with each other. We found that we had a lot in common and I know she liked spending time in my company too. We connected. 

I was gathering the courage to take the next step. It was something that came from deep within me. A psychological impulse that drove me forward. I knew she could reject me and that it would hurt but I just couldn't resist it.

One day I sent her a text asking if she wanted to hang out, just the two of us. I brought some coffee and some snacks and we just talked about our common interests, mainly the group we were members of. The whole time I was thinking, ""should I or shouldn't I?"". Before I was about to leave, I told her how I felt about her. 

What happened next took over my every waking thoughts for the next couple of years. The limerance I felt up to the point where I expressed my feelings was only a small taste of what was to come of the full force of the feelings, thoughts and actions I was to experience.

1r5k4hd,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1r5k4hd/my_whole_world_crushed_when_i_realized_who_my/,my whole world crushed when i realized who my parents really are,"I always thought my culture was the reason my parents are how they are, i tried to excuse them in my head. my childhood was full of horrible immature parents who acted like children. i always thought id leave my family, i had a planned path until my parents found out i had a boyfriend and then i told them im planning on marrying him in a few years, i was 19 at the time. now 23. that was what i thought the only solution was for cultural reasons. I never thought that one thing would ruin my life. they caused my life hell after this, isolated me and even told me they will check me to see if im still a virgin. this was years ago and i never healed from the situation that is way deeper than im telling, i got auto immune disease from the stress.

back then until now, they were always the same they just show it more now. my mom will ask me where im going and when i tell her, she hears it, next thing you know my dads calling screaming asking me where I am, my mom sitting next to him, and when I tell him I just told my mom why couldn't she have told you, and ask her why she pretends that she didn't know. she lies and tell me how could i call her a liar, and that she never knew where i was going or that i even left. she does this constantly for many different situations.

my dad is someone i cant stand, he will lecture me to do things he will never do. the house is filthy, beyond filthy and he will go on and on about how much women live in this house and how nothing is fixed. mind you all of us women in the house go to school or work full time. my parents sit in the filth, drink coffee, watch tv and wait for us to come home and then talk about how we do nothing. my dad doesnt lift a finger. he even gets mad we dont take the trash, but thats the absolute least he can do! my dad tries to force me to massage his feet and if i say im busy he will turn into a monster and scream angry things at me. i have the flu right now and has the audacity to come to my bed, lecture me that i need to get up or ill get more sick and to go make dinner for everyone, then he puts his feet that are cold on my arm and tells me to massage it. then he huffs and puffs slams the door when i ignore him.

besides the fact that i am treated like a 14 year old, no privacy, always insulted, my mom talks about me to my older sister and dad all day then she acts nice and cool when its only me and her. but when my dads home shes mean to me and confronting me on things. i dont know what this performative bs is.

my mom never cared when i was sick, infact she calls me weak and makes fun of me and they tell me im always sick. so am i wrong now to have no sympathy for my parents when they are sick? my mom walks into my room moaning and groaning telling me she probably has cancer and all this bs and then gets upset when i give her no attention. why would i? what attention does she give me? the begining of my flu before it hit i had horrible body pain and fatigue, it was a 8am-8pm school day (labs and lectures, discussions) my longest day, i come home shes at the door, i tell him that i feel really weird my body hurts. she tells me ""just keep acting like a man, leaving the house and coming back everyday"" as if she wasnt the one who forced me to go to school when i didnt want to.

my final point here and advice im looking for is, it seems there is no way out of my situation, all my siblings are okay with my parents because they are not the ones who got caught with a boyfriend. they werent the ones hurt. so they track me and tell me i cant move out. i obviously can just dissapear but how will i deal with them cutting me off forever? gossip in the community about me running away, all of it. i will have to make my own life and be away from my siblings, and then i hear stories about girls from my culture and being cut off after they leave, and then many years later their parents pass away and they say they regret it. i dont want too. im very sensitive and also emotional/forgiving, i wont be able to live with myself. i also dont even work because everytime i work they literally fight me for my money, its so much drama and guilt tripping. im better without it. im mentally distracted and mentally distraught. i have 1 more year of university and been thinking of applying to schools far away and my grades have only improved the last 3 semesters and hopefully 4 after this one. so im worried my gpa wont be good enough. idk i just need some help. ive truly become mentally exhusated and i see no future for myself. i feel like there is no reason to keep going and trying to change my life",1,1771175762.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False
1r5k47d,https://www.reddit.com/r/Write_Right/comments/1r5k47d/who_needs_a_house/,Who Needs A House,"My name is Prinstin, as in the college, a spit in the eye by my father and his father before him. Their expectations, reinforced by a name that gives body to this chain binding me to the same trade of labor as them. That's right, trauma. Of course the only way to break this chain is through a very sacred ritual called, being a loser. 

I know that doesn't mean I need to be homeless, just ignore the snakes in tall grass but who has time for that, if making money needed an end this would be it. Plus how else am I supposed to know what I need. I’ve been pretty passively self destructive in the past year, attempt after attempt at losing security, security for dick. I’ve been morbidly obese, I’ve turned that into pain and muscle for what, the judgments of people whom I could command just as easily. The whole world, given to me so I can watch it be given to the next snot filled white sheet waiting to wear the projections of idiots we have the privilege to join. As the youngest blessed with the responsibility of pulp, in order to gain a soul I’d need to define the one I had, leaving home, leaving everything, that’ll do it. That’s not me talking, that’s the Buddha. 

Of course I’m not ignorant, I understand that there are rules, if not of the palace then ones of nature. I left home with a bell tent, an electric stove, and a jug of water, all packed and portable on an old red wagon. In my backpack I had three changes of clothes I shouldn't need to clean for a bit, a sleeping bag and a lot of protein. I wasn’t coming back till I’d find a place to call     mine, and that wouldn’t be long. One night driving out the city to find some abandoned property or a natural bowl of some kind I could settle in, I fell into some fortunate graces, I found an apartment. 

Unforeseen road work forced me down unfamiliar trails, trying to find my way back, I got stuck in a whole new pocket I never knew existed. Going down hill I’m quickly hidden by trees and wild foliage that had originally obstructed the exit going under the highway. Swooping back around I’m immediately the subject of the most beautiful painting, beams of light shaped by tall pines and cottons. The moist air acts as colored gels, creating defined separations of cool tones in the fog. Tightly woven grass, an untouched golf course suited better for carpeting than any kinda sport, housing wildlife brave enough to approach this garden's prized fruit. In the middle of the clearing, drenched in blue light at noon, stood a musk red subsidised apartment building. Exposed brick with paint that has warped the wall into some artistic imitation of cracking sand flats.

 The soft red invasive glow of the apartment keeps me hesitant. I parked on the green, behind a tree where there was more than enough cover to keep the car from being discovered for days, assuming typical foot traffic. Stop the car, I sit in the stale recycled air and debate lighting up, I pull myself out into the quiet field. Shrouded in darkness I can’t help but to feel consciously rejected by it, every living thing has eyes, even blind things, why would the dark be any better. I light a joint as paranoia creeps up on me till I force myself into the protective glow of the warm apartment light, finding my way around to the front, I’m greeted by a scorching cold iron fence. After some more investigation I discover no viable entrance, just a hole that seemed designed to rip whatever was dumb enough to use it. About three feet in diameter and two deep, long? Hooks facing the inside and staggered, instead I toss my sleeping bag over the top. Prepared to mend any tearing I scale the fence, avoiding unevenly spaced spikes at the top before landing in the courtyard. 

The iron fence turned an almost rust color before disappearing behind walls of rose bush, its design reaching towards the sky thanks to countless red flakes, I relight. Lettering the checkered patterned grass sat different and perfectly trimmed sculptures depicting the middle of some kinda chess game. Heavily favoring one side, the one sign of their stage being a bleeding marble trail following the path of every sculpture. The majority of which are tall and budding with white sage, the other team being reduced to dried shrubs, sustaining itself off its own muck. Following a carefully maintained path I step up onto the first exposed landing, looking over the garden I finish my smoke then drop it onto crumbling concrete.

Stepping inside I feel the world stop and start again as I take in the stark change in environment. It’s extremely white, looks like everything was painted then painted again. On the outside there was exposed brick with what was probably lead paint flaking off, in complete contrast the inside was eggshell white, from tile to foam ceiling panel, layers of uninterrupted eggshell paint. Squeaky soft grips accompany my walk along with drips of dew that have accumulated on my jacket outside, seamlessly mixing paint and mud. The entry way is a tight but tall corridor with a counter to my right, built into the wall and out of service. Continuing down it opens to a lobby with bronze mail boxes, all the furniture having an annoying amount of height, like it was meant to be barside.  

Thud ! . . . .

My attention was ripped away by a thud coming from the staircase. A loud and lone- 

Thud ! . . . .

Thud! . .

Thud!!

From just around the corner comes a beefy green head of lettuce. Flopping diagonally down the stairs and slapping the wall, before rolling and ending at my feet. Beautiful shades of purple that fade into green, a lady comes down the stairs in this silk green gown that changes with the light. Sitting on top, a reddish orange bob with jack-o-lantern teeth, delicate and bright eyes protected by frames that match. 

“I’m so sorry, I tried to stop it.” She called out on her way over. 

“Oh, that's fine. I was just kinda-” 

-Looking for a place to squat. Does she want to know that? Does she need to know?

Standing at the base of the staircase she softly says. “Hello?”

“Uh sorry, I was looking for a place. I wanted to rent a place to stay.” 

“That’s great, I’m married to the landlord.” She starts over with a pip in her step. “He just went out to get some supplies for the tenets.” Bent down to get her lettuce and snaps up. “ You… could imagine how that is.”

She speaks up in place of my silence. “Would you like to come up and wait for him?”

“Oh, ma’am I don’t-”

“Pfft it’s fine, we take meetings in our living room all the time.” She turns and without another invitation, or a single sign of… anything. Still I’ve never been one to look a gift horse in the mouth, if nothing then I might get a meal out of this experience. So I followed the women with the beefy greens. 

The staircase that had been parsley hidden by the accompanying archway, an odd lack of light I hadn't noticed from where I was standing just beyond the threshold. But the first thing I noticed wasn’t the shadows that danced around an invisible light source, it was an uncanny feeling brought on by a missing detail. It was the complete lack of corners, the whole room was cornerless. Scoops in the linoleum creating steps, while the whole cavern mimicked the same painting mishap as the lobby. But here collecting in the corners, making them disappear. If that wasn’t enough the staircase was also free standing, if not it’s supported by some optical illusion, maybe that’s why the lights had been so… wavy? Rolling the question around in my head I follow the landlady up to the tenth and top floor, where the walls once again returned to brick. 

We walk out of the open stairwell and quickly find ourselves at her door. Opening up, I step into a thick cloud of earthy dough and steaming cloves. I’m met with a moss green shag carpet and the loudest little shit of a dog. 

“Would you mind taking your shoes off, we have little booties if you’d like some”

“No, I’m alright.” I take my shoes off and place them beside the door with my backpack. 

From the kitchen five feet away, she’s already flipping around greens in a pan before checking a pot of an unseen but fragrant green chili. “I’m sorry, could you take a seat over there. I’ll be done in a minute.”

I step over and past her island towards their living space, I sit in one of three different sofas all facing each other. A coffee table with a small radio sits in the middle of seven glasses with varying levels of green. I sink into a particularly itchy, probably felt lazy boy, a shitsu with its hair up comes hovering over on its coat. It sat at the end by the lazy boy, looking at me. I take a deep breath and scan the room breaking eye contact with the little guy, Christmas gnomes and tiny deer figurines define the silhouette of random side tables, that’s when I noticed the room was lit by candles. Flickering, dancing lights projecting scenes of tiny villages being ravaged by beastly deer, the twilight forest outlined by moon light divided into beams of yellow ending with oak trimmings before meeting a jungle green carpet. The people rejoice as the dog restores balance to their violent ecosystems, and I sit snuggled up, high as balls. 

 I watch as gnomes get together for a hunt. They gather bobby pins and harvest strips of wood from trimmings, festivals in preparation or remorse take place as they prepare their battlements. Isolating a deer that they spend days catching up to, just to scare it off again, their weapons looking more and more like props with every performance. I watch their victory take place as the forest swirls around us, and the landlady steps in with a plate of fried… things. Spendly little stems coming off one big bulb, pressed in olive oil with spots of cumin. Green of course. She places it on top of the radio and pours one green cup into another before grabbing that glass, giving it a little stir to mix the different shades.

She takes a seat and a sip before lowering the glass to her side. “It’s been great, we’ve never been happier. Just last fall we were out on the streets, we’re registered real estate agents. But independent work hasn’t been kind since all the properties have been going to some private business.” She recrosses her legs before another sip, focus waning. “Being out in the wild, relying on your own way of things. Learning what you can, from nature. Attempting not to fall off. That or starting a new way, get responsible for muck. Not by choice, just how things are. Build off of someone's kingdom, knowing it will erode like the largest mountains. Just like every brick, every crop turning to rot.”

She smiles and flicks her eyes from the ground back to me. 
“Crosses to bare.”
“Baring to cross again.”
“And again.” 

“Began in a familiar reign”
“Get lost, attempt to find,”
“what you know you won’t regain”

“Again and again”

“Ris’in from twilight lighted dirt.”
“Just to lay when the light falls.”
“It’ll hurt” 
“Before it’s done.”

“Once they're gone, it’s for me to be done.”
“Again and again”

Her eyes glazed over, her focus long passed where my head sat. She’d gone blind in the span of a few words, almost impossible not to notice the cataracts set in. She says sheepishly “I don’t want to die”.  I regain motion in my legs and the decision to stay still is impossible, I am trembling. My spirit already leaning out the door, I focus on creating that path while shifting pressure to the arms of the chair. Lifting myself up her eyeline doesn't waver, rolling on the palms of my hands I carefully remove my hands. A perfect dismount snubbed by an inevitable creek in the wood. 

Her eyes pierce mine, a singular moving flame in her eyes dance, reseeding back out of sight. “He’s here”. I jump back and kick the dog, it yapps, I twist it in my legs bringing us both to the ground. Growls and the indifinable shape of its stuggle keeps me pined while it finds its way over my face. I come back up to find an empty apartment. Every trace of the land lady and her occupancy gone, leaving nothing but an unlit space and hints of nutmeg in the air.

 Unsettled I reach for the door and find the handle, feeling judged by the very recently inhabited room I don't look back, regretfully it doesn't matter. Before opening the door, the silence, the moon light leaking from under the door. Going out it's clear the power is out, an opened window, opisite the stairs, lights just beyond the room. Confidently heading for the stairs becomes harder and harder as uncertainty creeps in. But fear of what I know over powers what I don’t, to cope I let my arms rise ahead of me, keeping pace. 

Expectancy of the firet step keeps my fear from progressing to excitement. Walking down the hall, pass where I expected the stairs, I begin to expect a dip with every step. Stomping down the hall, arms steached out in front of me, I'd be a little embarrassed to see my crawl for safty. But who'd care, like a gnome hunting deer, I'd dance till dinner cooked its self. That lasted till I pushed something soft, then heard a crack, and chunks rolling down some steps, the sound following, fading away. 

Following the banister it's a couple floors till I see light. The second the steps were reviled I jumped to them, and move a floor down before catch my breath. Slowing pace I let my heart rest, not stopping my decent. The woman with a jack-o-lantern smile, wife of the landlord, so inviting. God! What's happening, why invite me to just… do that? When did she decide to do that? What was up with the… everything, the candles, the food. What was that spendily thing she cooked, and that dog, it could have been part of the carpet. Fuck, the carpet, my shoes, my bag! Was that the motivation the whole time? With the silk gown, a goofy ass smile and the beefy greens… the lettues… How did the lettuce hit the walls on the way down? Better yet, what did I push down? At the bottom of the steps I turn and see a pumpkin, broken and strune out, like it got all the way down before breaking. 

Fully invested in the mess, my focus is broken by a distant bell, followed by wet drips. 

“He’s here.” I quietly go back up the steps, making it to the sixth floor, right before the darkness. ",1,1771175744.0,Write_Right,0,1.0,False

1r5k3ks,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghoststories/comments/1r5k3ks/my_ghost_stories_my_roommates_experiences/,My Ghost Stories: My roommates experiences,"Hello! As I have mentioned before the people I have lived with have experienced some strange things. Sometimes I don't even have to be at their house for more than a night. 

The best example of that is when I met my sons father's family. We went to see them one day. I was supposed to get to know them and they were supposed to get to know me. That happened, and it was nice. We ate and talked for most of the day. It was starting to get late and his mom asked us to stay over. The next morning we were sitting at the dinning room table when his sister started talking about an encounter she had in the kitchen. Now, for context they are hard core Christians. So, any experience they have with the paranormal must be a demon. Anyway, she said she had gotten up because her youngest at the time was crying. She went to get him some warm milk to help him get back to sleep and when she came into the kitchen she saw a large hunched over shadow blocking the room where her brother and I were sleeping. Now, of course I knew exactly what she had seen and who and what it was, but I couldn't get a word in before her and her mother started praying and blessing the house. Which I get, it freaked them out and if I hadn't realized who she had seen I would have likely done something to get it out too. I never told them who it was though because they would have made my ex break up with me then and there. Which now that I think about it, would have saved me years of heartache. Anyway, we went home and I told him that I was going to take a walk. What I really did was get far enough away that nobody at the house would see me and called out to the shadow his sister had seen. 

This is going to sound bad, but I don't think he's going to hurt me. I say this because of what he is. I have many ghosts and entities that follow me as you all know. He is one of them. I call him Imp. I know how that sounds but really he's not going to hurt anyone. He is only about a foot to a foot and a half tall. What she saw that night was his wings. Poor thing has really large wings. Most of the time, he will hangout in a tree or when I lived in an apartment on the balcony. He was just there to make sure I was okay. So, yes Imp is an imp of some variety or other but he's not evil. Just a bit mischievous. Anyway, I called out to him and asked why he had scared the sister like that. He calmly told me, ""She's a b***h and doesn't like you."" I can't say that he was wrong at that point in time, but she grew to be a good friend towards the end of my relationship with her brother. 

Plenty of my old roommates have seen Imp. My best friend's husband saw him sitting on our second story balconies railing one night. As he tells it, he got up to make sure there was coffee and he looked out the balcony door and saw this tiny thing with large wings sitting on the railing. When I told him who he saw, he said to tell him to stay outside and to not freak barely awake people. Imp had a lot of fun messing with him, I had to yell at him several times because of that. My bestie has also seen him and most recently my mother-in-law saw him in the hall of out apartment. I've banished him to the outside because he doesn't really fit in the apartment. He just likes freaking people out.

So, Imp is a common experience for roommates. The less common ones are the small shadows that run down hallways or move suddenly out of the corner of your eyes. Usually, I can say that they are a pet that passed just checking on us, cause sometimes that's what it is. Unfortunately, there are also times when I have no clue what they are. Most of those are seen late at night when I'm asleep. For context I go to bed at nine, but most of the people I have lived with are insomniacs and stay up till the early morning. So, they see some things that I don't. For example, my husband told me that he's seen shadows moving in the hallways of our current apartment and others. The human looking ones don't bother him to much, it's the ones that look like someone acting like a monkey on the ground that bother him. 

Unfortunately, I don't have an explanation for those. Mostly because I don't see them often and when I do I don't know that I remember everything about the experience to say who or what I saw. Just the other night my husband and I were playing a video game in the living room and he said that something that wasn't a pet moved in the hallway towards the bathroom. He said it was a squatting thing. He's told me this before but not when I am awake with him. I turned towards the hall to see if I saw anything and could put his mind to rest about it. Unfortunately, I didn't see it. I'm starting to think that they don't want me to see them. But they really need to leave my insomniacs alone. 

My brother's, my bestie and her husband, even my mom and mother-in-law, have all seen these things. I've started calling them the creeper's because all of the people that have seen them say that they see them out of the corner of their eyes and that they creep around corners, and in the hall. I've tried to stay up late to see them but my brain checks out at nine. I'm sure I've seen them before, I just don't retain anything about them. I'm not worried that they are going to hurt me or my family, but they are really annoying to those that have seen them. The only advice I can give them is to try and ignore them, which my husband tells me is hard to do when they appear multiple times a night. I really don't know what to do about them, because even after cleansing the house and banishing my ghosts outside they are still there. It's rather annoying for me too at this point.

I have officially been out for a few months, unofficially been out a year. For me, being exmo in front of my family has been a little bit easy, because I'm not the only one, and you're kinda stuck with them no matter what.

I have a nevermo fiance who has been nothing but supportive for my entire faith journey. I now enjoy coffee, tea, alcohol, multiple piercings, and I really want to get tattooed.

But I have some devout TBM friends. I love them very much. We have been friends for well over ten years now.  They know I haven't attended church in a very long time, but I think they think I'm somewhat faithful to the religion.

With my wedding coming up soon, I expect I won't be able to hide my true self from my friends for much longer. I want to let loose and have fun at my wedding, but I don't want to make them uncomfortable either and risk losing their friendship.

I know they love me, but I am very worried they will pull back once they figure out I'm not a member anymore. They are chill with nevermos like my fiance, but exmo is different territory. I'm also worried that having a formal convo will make it Serious(TM) and then they'll be forced to take a side. I may be overthinking this tho.

How did y'all come out as exmo to loved ones? How did it turn out? What was the hardest part?

Rushed to get ready and spilled coffee all down my shirt so had to change which made me even later that i missed my bus by the time i finally got out the door. I then decided to walk to the next stop and nearly got taken out by some guy on a Chinese electric scooter who wasn't paying attention. Had to jump onto someone's lawn to avoid getting hit and landed in sludge. So now I'm late, caffeinated on the outside instead of the inside.
Got to work finally and realize I left my laptop at home and had to use a spare company laptop that was so old and slow and laggy it made me want to do my head in. Lunch was supposed to be my reset but the place I ordered from forgot half my order.
Then on the way home my card kept  getting declined at the grocery store even though I had money, the machine was just being a bitch. And when i got home to relax and empty my brain by scrolling it was like my fyp had been reset and it was ad after ad, temu, alibaba, wellness hacks, that job application app, like, i just wanted to watch one of those of horribly acted short dramas on tiktok, that wasn’t asking for too much.

1r5jzyx,https://www.reddit.com/r/InterviewHacking/comments/1r5jzyx/my_managers_tardiness_was_costing_us_good_people/,"My manager's tardiness was costing us good people, so I started lying to her.","  
I work as a bartender, and my manager has one rule she enforces on everyone but herself: punctuality. Whenever we have interviews, she makes a big deal if someone is even a minute late and asks me to log it. (Hint: I don't do that; I have more important things to do). Most of the time, she's still in the back office, or hasn't even arrived at the restaurant yet, and just texts me the interview schedule. But I started to notice that she's the one who is always late. The hypocrisy is what really drives me crazy. The last straw was when I saw a guy wait for over 30 minutes while she finally strolled in, grabbed something to eat from the kitchen, spent an hour on the phone with a supplier about a non-urgent order, and then chatted with a regular for 15 minutes before even thinking about the interview. And of course, as expected, he turned down the job.  
So I decided to try something. Since every restaurant in town is hiring, it's not unusual for applicants to skip an interview because they got another offer. It was the perfect cover. From then on, every time she was late and someone didn't show up, I'd make something up. I would tell her the person arrived right on time, waited a bit, and then left because she wasn't there. I was sure her pride would prevent her from calling to ask why they left, so there was no chance of me getting caught. Her reaction gradually changed from dismissive, ""I guess they didn't want the job that badly,"" (by the way, we desperately need people) to confused, ""Why is everyone leaving? I was only a few minutes late!"". The irony.  
Then I got a little bolder. Last week, a woman was waiting for about 15 minutes, looking visibly annoyed. I leaned over and told her, ""Look, the manager is on her way, but honestly, I wouldn't blame you if you left. No need to respect her time if she doesn't respect yours."" She smiled and said, ""You know what? I'm going to grab a coffee down the street, and if she shows up in the next few minutes, she can call me."" This would have been the seventh interview that ""walked out"" on my account. So when my manager arrived 10 minutes later, I told her the woman had just left but she might be able to catch her if she called. It was a pleasure to hear my manager stammering on the phone, apologizing and practically begging the woman to come back. The woman returned, but her eyes screamed 'don't mess with me.' My manager tried to smooth things over with some small talk: ""You know how Tuesday traffic is in this town! Haha."" The woman shot back without missing a beat: ""Yes, I do. That's why I left home early to make sure I'd be on time."" My manager gave a weak laugh and said, ""Right, yes, that shows you're responsible!"" I seriously had to go polish some glasses in the back to keep from laughing.  
Anyway, the plan worked. Since that day, my manager has been early for interviews. As soon as anyone arrives, she rushes over with a big smile, offers them water or coffee, and gets them settled and comfortable. We've hired a few very talented people that she likely would have lost before. So yeah, now I'm thinking about what else I can ""train"" my manager on.",1,1771175478.0,InterviewHacking,0,1.0,False
1r5jxgv,https://www.reddit.com/r/tipping/comments/1r5jxgv/percentage_is_not_a_good_tip_basis/,Percentage is NOT a Good Tip Basis,"I think that tipping as a percentage is a decent guide to start from, but a pretty terrible basis for a hand and fast rule. For average service at an average restaurant for an average meal, maybe, but changing any of those factors changes things.

""Average service"" is pretty obvious and is what's supposed to drive what percentage you choose. Above average service = above average tip. Pretty simple. Most servers follow the same script anyways. 

""Average restaurant"" is where things start to fall apart for me. The national average is around $25 for dinner. If I go to a nicer place where everything is twice that, it's expected that the service is better, but is it twice as good? Probably not. Same with going the other direction. If i go to a little diner for breakfast, where a basic meal and endless coffee coffee costs half that average, do they deserve half the tip? Definitely not, they are usually working harder than the other two examples here.

Then there's the ""average meal"". This is where it really falls apart. Imagine two tables at an average restaurant. Both have the same server and the same number of guests, let's say 2. One table orders water and the cheapest thing on the menu, say a $12.50 chicken salad for each of them. The other table orders the most expensive thing on the menu, let's say steak, and it's $40 each (remember, this is an average restaurant and the steak is mediocre). They also both get a margarita, and just for easy math, let's say they are $10 each (a bargain these days). They receive the exact same level of service (I know the server is incentivized to give better service to the 2nd table, but it's not THAT different), the server does the exact same amount of work, but one table's bill is $25 and the other's is $100. 20% tip comes to $5 and $20, respectively. Is that fair? This gets more out of hand if both tables get a refill on drinks. 

These things should all work together to determine an appropriate tip, but it seems the norm, and the expectation to is to just pay 15-25%. What do you guys think?",10,1771175316.0,tipping,8,0.92,False

I started a sourdough micro-bakery two years ago, and I was using my home oven to bake 20 loaves at a time, which took forever. However, although my bread is among the highest quality at the farmers market, I still struggle to sell all of it. Sometimes sales are good; sometimes they’re not. I dropped the price from $12 to $8, and some people still complain: “$8 for a loaf?” Meanwhile, another vendor nearby sells bread for $5—twice the size of mine. I realized he owns a coffee shop and bakes in bulk (about 40 loaves at a time). He also doesn’t use traditional sourdough fermentation; he makes the bread the same day but sells it as sourdough, and people buy it like crazy.

Another problem is that I can’t attend the farmers market every week since it’s in the middle of the week, and I want to expand my business beyond the farmers market. I tried flyers, but nobody reached out. I built a website, a phone app, and used Facebook, but I haven’t had much luck. I’m starting to think people may have less interest in authentic sourdough bread than I originally thought.

I’ll give myself some leniency due to the fact that we have been dealing with family crisis and my executive execution hasn’t been as strong. Well while chatting a cute girl and being excited to find a beautiful spot in one of my favorite forests I neglected to have checked the weather.

So here’s the play by play

>easily execute the approach. No problems whatsoever
>collect plenty a dry wood and tender, but taking in a lot of what I was coming across was damp. Thought crossed mind that this could be a more difficult fire than usual.
>make multiple attempts to sustain ultimately finding no success . Opt for bed, fantasizing that morning coffee and view.
>wake up to light rain; Think about moving the van back to the access road only about 30’ away. Lazily consider that the rain is light and will probably pass. Fall back asleep
>wake up about an hour later to more rain
>consider the consequences of more bad weather and decide to move. 
>Proceed to get bogged down while lacking tools to remediate
>no longer have the consistent single bar of service I entered with; it does show periodically in the right spots tho
>spend next 2+ hours calling for help
>get a tow company out to my location
>get pulled out in like 10min

Lessons learned for myself and my current rig:

**ALWAYS**, no matter what, check the weather (normally something I would not overlook)

Absolutely **never** get off a main access in even the slightest wet weather until I install my wench

Take preventative action **immediately** when encountering what could be a potentially dangerous situation

Always share a location with someone, **no matter** how *simple* the excursion seems

**Learn how to use** this satellite connection business I guess I get thru my Verizon plan

Don’t let distractions compromise safety!

Be safe out there yall!

1r5jrjf,https://i.redd.it/a22dwijdmojg1.png,A guide to a post-apocalyptic dumb ways to die simulator,"Hey fellow survivors!  
I’ve managed to stay alive for over seven months on a west point spawn with a puny unfit lumberjack on b42 apocalyptic settings (respawn off) and using wandering zombies.

Along the way I wrote down what I learned. Hopefully this helps new players, since useful info about this game is often scattered, outdated, or contradictory.

Here are my personal rules for surviving the apocalypse scenario:

**1 Min maxing your character is overrated**

You’ll die in a dumb way eventually, so don’t obsess over perfect builds.

**2 Mobility is key**

Get a working car as soon as possible. It greatly increases options for looting and survival. However, respect its condition, or… you’ll die in a dumb way.

**3 Always have an escape plan**

When exploring on foot, work outward from a safe zone so you can retreat when overwhelmed. And trust me, you *will* get overwhelmed.  

**4 Combat is all about moodle management**

If too many negative moodles pop up, retreat to the safe zone, rest up and get your shit together. Then get back in the fight.

**5 Take your time**

If zombies walk towards you from a screen's distance. You have enough time to eat a meal, sharpen your knife, rest up on the ground and read a HottieZ. Once you realise this, zombies become more of a nuisance than a terror.

**6 Fear the zombies you're not aware of**

It's better to lure them out than be surprised. Don't be afraid to shout. Relying on stealth is actually a dumb way to die. In addition, relying on sound (irl headphones help!) saves lives.

**7 Check behind you**

Zombies love to sneak up from behind when you are in combat so perform a 360 from time to time. Also, be mindful about your vision cone, it will be reduced by darkness or wearing helmets.

**8 Never fight at night.**

Nighttime severely impairs your awareness, which is one of the most important aspects in the game. Nighttime is wellness time! Read a book, drink a cup of tea, exercise, cook, rest up and manage your base.

**9 Fight light and be cool**

The ""heavy load"" and ""overheated"" moodles severely impact your combat and movement capabilities. 

**10 master the way of the cuisine**

Cooking meals makes you happy and helps to fight hunger more efficiently. 

**11 Food and water are abundant**

Stock rations to survive for a few days, but don't worry too much about starvation or dehydration. Even after the power and water shutoff, food and water can still be found everywhere by foraging, fishing, hunting, ranching and looting. Dying of hunger or thirst is one of the rarest scenarios. Forgetting to fill your water bottle before a long journey and realizing it in the middle of nowhere isn't.

**12 Generators aren't essential**

See rule 11, you can actually thrive without a freezer. Just carry a flashlight with a spare battery on you at all times when the power runs out. Running out of battery when fighting zombies in a dark area is a dumb way to die.

**13 Carry a spare weapon**

Your main weapon *will* break at the worst time.  

**14 Armor is important**

Whatever people tell you, armor can definitely save you from a nasty situation. However, never rely on it. It saved me multiple times from getting bit by zombies approaching from a funny angle, or ambushed me because of the large vision blockage of a small bush. Do keep rule 9 in mind when equipping armor, but being uncomfortable is better than being dead.

**15 Guns are good**

Sure they draw zombies, but they also kill them efficiently. Before firing your first shot, bring enough ammunition to kill about 50 to 100 zombies, depending on the area. Guns are a primary means of engagement, don't save them up for emergency situations, they will only make it worse.

**16 Don't get to the choppa!**

When you hear the helicopter, get in a car asap and drive as far away from your base, don't forget to bring some food and water. You could also use the helicopter to lead away zombies from overrun locations to loot them later. Don't linger in your base because even when the helicopter doesn't see you, it will still attract zombies towards your base by randomly flying over.

**17 You will die in a dumb way.**

I've died by keeping the lid on a jar and microwaving it, eating a few cubes of burned bacon, jumping through a window while trying to open it, accidently vaulting a staircase, exiting a vehicle next to 3 zombies at night because I forgot about the vision cone reduction, petting a stressed animal, laceration by tree, engaging a horde equipped with a dead rabbit. The list is never-ending. Heck, I just saw a post from someone dying by making a backward u turn in a car. It happens... Laugh, learn and try again.

**Extra advice**

To get the most fun out of the game, use an online map sparingly. It feels way more rewarding to go out and discover locations by yourself.

Furthermore I highly recommend using QoL mods to make the gameplay experience less tedious. Mods which auto train skills, auto cook, and better inventory/loot management.

Don't expect perfect realism. More often the game's complexity results in hilarious absurdity than realistic scenarios. But boy is it fun! You can spend weeks mastering the arts of blacksmithing and axe combat, felling half a forest to forge the ultimate zombie-killing weapon. Then charging into a horde finding out you're equipped with a dead rabbit and wondering where your weapon went, because the game automatically unequipped your newly forged axe when you picked up the rabbit you accidently ran over some miles ago. R.I.P. Ferdinand McGinnis, may you find peace at last, forever dreaming of the perfect pot of rabbit stew.

**Advanced tips:**

* Don't use generators indoors, they will kill you slowly by carbon monoxide poisoning.
* Mix alcohol, soda milk and water for a functional beverage. Your character auto drinks it if water has the highest ratio in the mixture.
* Don't sleep in a location with many corpses around, dying by corpse sickness is a thing.
* When using one handed weapons, equip any bag as a secondary to increase your overall carry capacity without any downsides.
* You can watch the life and living channel at a tv around 6:00, 12:00 and 18:00 to gain levels in carpentry, cooking and survival skills up to a cap of 3 levels. You can set an alarm on a digital watch 30 minutes prior as a reminder. However, be mindful of your neighbors and turn the volume down. Noise nuisance is a dumb way to die. Also don't worry about missing these shows since you can find VCRs of the shows to watch them later. Actually you can find VCR's which can level aiming, reloading, mechanics and short blade skills they have the same 3 level cap as the tv shows.
* When transporting animals to your base, let them calm down in the trailer for a few days. A stressed out pig can wreak more havoc to your fencing than a horde of zombies.
* You can hook up a generator to a gas station to be able to get gas after the power runs out.
* It's actually faster to tow cars in reverse, or use cruise control to get the car to a speed where it doesn't switch to 2nd gear.
* When having access to multiple cars, you can use them as formidable weapons by driving them backwards into hordes. However, be mindful of rule 2.
* You can pick up decorative animal hides you encounter in some locations and use them for crafting.
* Turn gold jewelry in gold scrap which u can turn in sheets, then coins to level up blacksmithing. Smelt coins and repeat.
* Same with using a loom for leveling up tailoring. Sew long johns, rip them up, get thread, create cotton fabric at the loom and repeat.
* Backroads can spawn wild hordes with a survivor zombie who always has a backpack with rare skill books and good loot. So go out and explore.
* One cow provides a lifetime supply of milk. It does require the cow to have a baby though.
* You can hunt wild deer by sneaking towards it and using a long range rifle to shoot it from a distance. Follow the blood trail if the deer survived the shot and ran away. Butcher the corpse to decrease the encumbrance of the meat package. You can even build a butcher hook on site to butcher more efficiently if you bring the right supplies.
* Post offices are a good source for handiknifes, books, magazines and other random loot.
* Cars can spawn with survivor loot in their trunk.
* Check the mail of your neighbours, you will be surprised at what you can find.
* Muldraugh has two really good locations to find a lifetime supply of propane.
* When entering a new area, be on the lookout for harvestable crops and harvest them asap.
* Fighting zombies always reduces boredom and killing zombies reduces stress. I'm not sure about the stress aspect for fresh survivors, it might be an acquired trait over time.
* Shotguns with a full choke tube have a surprisingly long lethal range.
* You can dig up clay near lakes or the river with a shovel and a sack.
* Make bread out of yeast and flour to make sandwiches which give a boost to your calories for weight gain. Butter, which can be made from milk, also works really well.
* Basements can spawn really good loot. I once found a basement which contained enough ammo to kill a whole town.
* With cars, engine quality (not condition) matters for its performance. It is always random and fixed per car. Crashed ambulances have a high chance of spawning with 100 engine quality, but you have to fix them up.
* Supposedly there is a button which makes you sprint (shift is for running), but I've never used it. Could be useful if you mix up sprinters in your scenario.
* Use coffee, tea, soda's and caffeine pills to manage your tiredness and get the most out of your days. If you brew up a full container of coffee with a coffee machine it can get you through several days without sleeping.
* Use the emergency broadcast channel found on some radios to gain weather forecasts and plan your loot runs accordingly. It broadcasts every day on the top of every hour. It also gives you a heads up for the power shutdown.
* The developers will only release a new update or build after a certain number of players maxed out blacksmithing.
* If you have zombie respawn on, and don't want zombies spawning in an area you fenced in, use an airlock system. The game uses a pathfinding system to spawn in zombies, if you have 1 gate and open it, the system has access to your base. However It doesn't if you create an airlock with 2 gates from where you always keep one of the gates closed.",0,1771174945.0,projectzomboid,6,0.24,False
1r5jqob,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_United_Price4291/comments/1r5jqob/how_to_apply_for_an_indian_tourist_visa_my/,How to Apply for an Indian Tourist Visa: My Unforgettable Journey to the Heart of India,"**Disclaimer:** This comprehensive travel story and guide is provided for informational and entertainment purposes only. Visa regulations, fees, and procedures can change at any time. The information here is based on the latest available details as of early 2026 from official sources. Always verify the most current requirements directly on the official Indian e-Visa portal or through authorized Indian missions. This is not legal advice, and I am not a visa consultant. Consult official government websites, embassies, or professional visa services for personalized guidance. Success in obtaining a visa depends on individual circumstances, and approvals are at the discretion of Indian authorities.

As a passionate wanderer from the bustling streets of Melbourne, Australia, I had always dreamed of setting foot in the vibrant tapestry of India. The colors, the chaos, the ancient wonders—it called to me like a siren's song. But before I could lose myself in the aroma of street-side chai or the rhythmic chants of temple bells, there was one crucial hurdle: figuring out **how to apply for an Indian Tourist Visa**. Little did I know that this process would become the opening chapter of my most epic travel story yet.

It all started on a rainy afternoon in late 2025. I was scrolling through travel blogs, mesmerized by images of the Taj Mahal glowing at dawn and the serene backwaters of Kerala. ""India,"" I whispered to myself, ""it's time."" But excitement quickly turned to a mix of anticipation and mild panic. As an Australian citizen, I knew I was eligible for the convenient e-Tourist Visa, but the details? They felt overwhelmed. That's when I dove headfirst into researching **how to apply for an Indian Tourist Visa**.

I spent hours on forums, reading stories from fellow travelers who had navigated the online portal successfully—and a few who hadn't. One thing became clear: understanding **how to apply for an Indian Tourist Visa** isn't just about filling forms; it's about preparing for an adventure that begins long before your plane touches down in Delhi or Mumbai.

The Taj Mahal at sunrise— a vision that fueled my determination to master **how to apply for an Indian Tourist Visa** and make this dream a reality.

# The Spark: Why India Captivated My Soul and Sparked My Visa Quest

India isn't just a destination; it's a symphony of senses. From the snow-capped Himalayas in the north to the sun-kissed beaches of Goa in the south, every corner whispers stories of emperors, sages, and resilient souls. As I planned my six-week itinerary—starting in Rajasthan's golden deserts, wandering through Varanasi's sacred ghats, and ending with yoga retreats in Rishikesh—I realized that without a proper visa, none of this would happen.

My research revealed that India offers multiple visa options for tourists, but the e-Tourist Visa stands out for its simplicity. Available to citizens of over 170 countries, including Australia, it comes in three flavors: a 30-day visa (double entry), a 1-year multiple-entry visa, and a 5-year multiple-entry option. Each allows stays of up to 180 days in a calendar year, with no more than 60 days per visit for the shorter ones—perfect for my exploratory trip.

But the real game-changer was learning **how to apply for an Indian Tourist Visa** online. No embassy visits, no endless queues. Just a few clicks from my cozy apartment. I bookmarked the official site and began the process that would transform my vague wanderlust into a concrete plan.

# Chapter 1: Laying the Foundation – Eligibility and Preparation for How to Apply for an Indian Tourist Visa

Before touching the keyboard, I double-checked my eligibility. Australian passports qualify seamlessly for the e-Tourist Visa. The passport had to be valid for at least six months beyond my planned arrival date, with at least two blank pages. Mine was fresh—issued just last year after an unfortunate coffee spill on the old one.

I gathered my documents meticulously. A recent passport-style photo (white background, no smiles that looked too forced), a scanned copy of my passport's bio page, and details of my travel plans. Pro tip from a Reddit thread: Have your hotel bookings ready, even if tentative. Indian authorities appreciate proof of accommodation.

As I organized everything on my desk, I felt a surge of excitement. This wasn't bureaucracy; it was the first step into the unknown. Understanding **how to apply for an Indian Tourist Visa** started here—with preparation that felt like packing for the journey itself.

A glimpse of what my passport would soon hold: the coveted Indian Tourist Visa stamp, a gateway to a thousand stories.

# Chapter 2: Navigating the Digital Portal – The First Steps in How to Apply for an Indian Tourist Visa

Armed with my laptop and a strong cup of coffee, I visited [https://indianvisaonline.gov.in/evisa/tvoa.html](https://indianvisaonline.gov.in/evisa/tvoa.html). The site was user-friendly, a far cry from the clunky portals of yesteryear. I selected ""e-Tourist Visa"" and chose the 1-year option for flexibility—multiple entries meant I could pop over to Nepal if the mood struck.

Filling the form felt like writing a travel journal. Personal details: name, date of birth, passport number. Then came the travel itinerary—ports of entry (I chose Delhi), duration of stay, and addresses in India. I listed my first hotel in Jaipur, a charming heritage haveli.

One section that made me pause was the ""Previous Travel to India"" query. As a first-timer, it was a simple ""No,"" but I imagined seasoned nomads breezing through with their history.

Halfway through, I hit save. The system generated a temporary application ID—my digital talisman. This is where **How to Apply for an Indian Tourist Visa** truly begins to unfold, turning abstract dreams intoa structured reality.

I took a break, stepping onto my balcony to imagine the chaos of Chandni Chowk markets. The form wasn't just paperwork; it was my bridge to that world.

# Chapter 3: The Upload Dance – Documents That Seal the Deal in How to Apply for an Indian Tourist Visa

Uploading documents was the most nerve-wracking part. My photo had to be JPEG, between 10KB and 1MB, face centered, white background. I snapped a fresh one in natural light—no filters, just me looking hopeful.

The passport scan? PDF, crisp and under 300KB. I used a free online tool to compress it perfectly. The portal accepted both without a hitch, but I triple-checked the guidelines: no glasses in the photo, no shadows, head straight.

Many travelers I connected with online swore by scanning in good lighting. One Australian expat shared how a blurry upload delayed his approval by days. Lesson learned: Quality matters in **How to Apply for an Indian Tourist Visa**.

Just like this focused traveler, I poured my attention into every field, knowing that precision was key to unlocking India's doors.

# Chapter 4: Payment and Submission – The Moment of Truth in How to Apply for an Indian Tourist Visa

Fees vary by nationality and visa type. For my 1-year e-Tourist Visa as an Australian, it was around AUD 100-120, plus a small processing fee. I paid via credit card—secure and instant.

The portal warned of a 2.5% bank charge, but it was worth it. After submission, a confirmation email arrived instantly. Now, the wait began. Official processing is typically 4-7 days, but recent updates noted it could take 8-10 days during peak seasons. I applied four weeks before departure to be safe—a smart move in mastering **how to apply for an Indian Tourist Visa**.

To fill the time, I dove deeper into Indian culture. I watched documentaries on the Mughal era, practiced basic Hindi phrases like ""Namaste"" and ""Shukriya,"" and even tried cooking butter chicken from a YouTube tutorial. The visa process wasn't a chore; it was building anticipation.

# Chapter 5: The Waiting Game and Approval – Triumph in How to Apply for an Indian Tourist Visa

Days turned into a week. I checked my email obsessively. Then, on day 6, it arrived: ""Your e-Visa Application is Approved."" The PDF attachment was beautiful—a sleek Electronic Travel Authorization (ETA) with my details and a QR code.

I printed two copies, one for my bag and one as backup. The approval letter detailed entry ports: 31 airports and 5 seaports. Delhi was confirmed.

This moment crystallized everything I'd learned about **how to apply for an Indian Tourist Visa**. It wasn't just approval; it was validation that my planning had paid off.

Connor Hellebuyck will get the start for Team USA, and I don’t expect Germany to generate much against him. On the other side, Philipp Grubauer is starting for the second straight day — and after watching Latvia put up four goals against him, I’m not convinced he holds up here.

They talked on bumble. Liked each other. She invited him to come near Ranikuthi. He reached. She took him to a cafe named CAFE COUPLE ZONE. This cafe is inside an GOVERNMENT HOUSING COMPLEX. She takes the initiative and orders hookah. Doesn't like it, then changes and again orders a hookah. And some coffee as usual. My friend finds all this fishy bcz this cafe is at a place where literally no one lives and not a single person in a cafe except some local boys. 

He tells her to leave. They give him a bill. It's whooping 11,000rs. For 2 coffee and a shisha. 🤣
Itna bill toh GRAND YA PARK hotel mein bhi nahi aata. My friend calls me. I know this is a scam. I ask him to run for his life. He tries to escape but they have it all covered. They grab him and beat him and ask him to pay. We paid at the end. Bcz not our area. We can't go anything. When they dragged him back, she was gone. They let her go 🤣🤣

1r5jmqv,https://www.reddit.com/r/creativewriting/comments/1r5jmqv/the_quietest_job_in_merseyside/,The Quietest Job in Merseyside,"People think criminals are loud.

Sirens. Tyres screaming. Engines howling through red lights while helicopters circle like angry insects. That’s the film version, the comforting lie. It reassures people that crime looks like chaos.

In reality, the dangerous ones are polite.

Martin Keegan’s gang never ran.

They queued.

If you’d passed them on Smithdown Road that Tuesday morning you’d have seen nothing, a dull silver hatchback creeping through traffic at a perfect thirty miles an hour. Indicator used. Full stop at junctions. A courteous wave to a bus driver.

Behind the wheel, Gary drove like he was taking his nan to the garden centre.

“Green means go,” Gary muttered.

“Green means *don’t draw attention*,” Martin replied, sipping coffee and reading a racing paper.

Ordinary was protection. Ordinary wasn’t remembered.

====

The robbery itself lasted four minutes.

They walked into the bank in office clothes. ID lanyards. Plastic smiles. One man held the door open for a pensioner leaving. Another apologised to a cashier for interrupting her morning.

No masks. No shouting. No smashing.

The manager understood immediately when Martin calmly showed him a photo, not a weapon, not violence. Just the manager’s own car outside his house, taken the day before.

“You’re not in danger,” Martin said gently.  
“Not unless you make it complicated.”

Drawers opened. Bags filled. A final “thank you for your cooperation.”

They left as customers entered.

Outside, a cyclist nearly clipped Gary and apologised. Gary apologised back.

Then they drove away…

…at thirty.

They stopped at a pedestrian crossing.

Within ten minutes they were another vehicle in traffic.  
Within twenty they were nobody.

===

Detective Sergeant Elaine Harper didn’t arrive to sirens. The job was already over. No dramatic aftermath, just shaken staff and paperwork.

“What did they say?” she asked the receptionist.

“Honestly… they were nice,” the woman said, embarrassed. “One of them even thanked me for telling him where the toilets were.”

Harper paused.

“Where the toilets were?”

“Yes.”

It was the first odd thing.

Calm criminals don’t ask directions inside a place they’ve carefully planned. That meant someone had been inside before — casually.

So Harper didn’t hunt robbers.

She hunted visitors.

===

Three days before the robbery a fire alarm inspection had taken place. A subcontracted technician had signed the visitor book.

The postcode on the form was wrong.

Not fake.

Wrong.

A liar invents details.  
A hurried person writes something almost true.

So Harper pulled a list of men living near that postcode who fit the age range and had small past offences, theft, fraud, minor dishonesty. Not professionals. Just capable.

It gave her a handful of names.

She didn’t arrest anyone.

She waited.

===

Meanwhile, the gang celebrated by *not* celebrating.

No holidays. No spending sprees. No disappearing acts. Life continued exactly as before, which Martin considered their masterpiece.

But humans run on routine.

Gary still visited his brother every Thursday.  
Tom still played darts every Friday.  
Liam still went to the same café.

And Martin knew success was the dangerous part.

“Stop looking pleased,” he told Liam one morning as news of the robbery played above the café counter.

“I’m not.”

“You’re glowing.”

Across the room a woman glanced at Liam, not suspiciously, just noticing.

Martin didn’t like noticing.

===

Harper’s second clue wasn’t a camera.

It was silence.

Phones constantly talk to nearby masts, not precise tracking, just presence. During the exact four-minute robbery window, several regular daily phones near the bank vanished briefly. Switched off or left elsewhere.

People don’t randomly disappear from the digital world at 10:18am on a weekday.

She cross-referenced the missing devices with her postcode shortlist.

Four names overlapped.

Gary’s was one of them.

Still not proof.

Just probability tightening.

===

 

So she watched.

Not dramatic stakeouts, time. Paperwork. Patience.

She mapped movements. Humans orbit the same places: homes, pubs, gyms, relatives. Alone it meant nothing. Together it formed shape.

Gary visited the same house weekly.  
Another man from the list appeared on the same street but never entered.  
A third encountered both of them separately, but never together.

Careful men avoiding coincidence.

Too careful.

Then she saw Martin.

In the café.

He walked in, ordered coffee, stood two metres from Liam, and neither acknowledged the other.

Strangers ignore each other naturally.

But only people who know each other extremely well can ignore each other that deliberately.

Harper finally had a theory.

She still waited.

===

The final piece was almost boring.

Forensics didn’t find fingerprints or dramatic DNA. They found paper dust, fibres from a specific packaging sack.

Only two wholesalers nearby sold that type.

One had a recent cash purchase.

The shop’s car park camera showed Gary’s car.

Not the bank.

The shop.

It was enough.

Warrants followed.

===

Three months after the robbery Martin stood at a supermarket self-checkout buying bread and milk when a man beside him politely showed a badge.

“Morning. Mind coming with us for a chat?”

No shouting.  
No chase.

Outside, Gary was already sitting in a police car.

Gary shrugged. “Didn’t even run a red light.”

Martin almost laughed.

Because now he understood.

They hadn’t been caught by speed, cameras, or a heroic witness.

They’d been caught by trivial things:

a polite question about toilets,  
a nearly correct postcode,  
ten minutes of missing phones,  
carefully separated friendships,  
a familiar café,  
and a bag bought from the wrong shop.

No single clue solved the crime.

Time did.

You can act ordinary for a day.  
You can even act ordinary for months.

But you cannot out-ordinary an entire world that quietly records patterns forever.

I'm definitely not the worst case, but at times it gets pretty bad (feeling of suffocation despite open nostril, bad feedback, chest tightness). I had coldness but it has disappeared completely. Also sesame oil has helped a ton with the dryness to the point it rarely bothers me in itself.

I still get stuffed sometimes, especially when i drink a lot of coffee (increases histamine) or get exposed to dust. When i drink a lot of coffee it seems i am much more sensitive to allergy triggers. Also, after an allergy bout, my nose feels much more normal. 

I heard people with allergies are more prone to have their turbinates hypertrophy again and needing repeat turbinate reduction.

Recently I’ve realized a pattern that’s been bothering me. Every time someone I know comes to my hometown (it’s an island), I tell them I’m here and that we could meet. And every time, it just… never happens.

This has happened three times in the last three months, with three different people.

First person:

A friend of mine. Before she came here, I saw her where she lives, and she was very enthusiastic about meeting when she’d be here. She talked about having dinner together, possibly with her family. When she actually came, I tried to start a conversation about meeting, but nothing came of it and we didn’t end up seeing each other. She was here with her close family and her boyfriend’s family.

Second person:

Someone who was a very good friend of mine about 10 years ago. She came here with her partner. I texted her to let her know I was here in case she wanted recommendations or to meet. She asked for a coffee place, said we should meet, and asked where I lived. After that, there was no more communication and we didn’t meet.

Third person:

A good friend from high school whom I’ve always appreciated. She’s very warm and friendly and recently texted me to catch up. When I found out she was coming here, I told her I was here. She suggested meeting, told me where she’d be. I asked how long she’d be staying, and she never replied.

This has honestly made me feel low. I’m not pushy at all, if anything, I try to keep things simple and not force anything because people have their plans. Now I’m wondering if that’s actually part of the problem. Maybe I’m not insisting enough? But insisting feels uncomfortable to me.

I’ve tried to tell myself that they’re here with other people and their first intention is not to see me, or that they’re just too busy. Still, having this happen three times in such a short period has affected me more than I expected. Specially because Ive been feeling kinda lonely. I just have my boyfriend here, no one else to hang out.

I’d appreciate any outside perspective on this.",1,1771174560.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

Big windows. Clean lines. City views. Balcony moments.

Coffee shops, nightlife, and everything you need are literally steps away.

1r5jf98,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1r5jf98/rf_the_quietest_job_in_merseyside/,[RF] The Quietest Job in Merseyside,"People think criminals are loud.

Sirens. Tyres screaming. Engines howling through red lights while helicopters circle like angry insects. That’s the film version, the comforting lie. It reassures people that crime looks like chaos.

In reality, the dangerous ones are polite.

Martin Keegan’s gang never ran.

They queued.

If you’d passed them on Smithdown Road that Tuesday morning you’d have seen nothing, a dull silver hatchback creeping through traffic at a perfect thirty miles an hour. Indicator used. Full stop at junctions. A courteous wave to a bus driver.

Behind the wheel, Gary drove like he was taking his nan to the garden centre.

“Green means go,” Gary muttered.

“Green means *don’t draw attention*,” Martin replied, sipping coffee and reading a racing paper.

Ordinary was protection. Ordinary wasn’t remembered.

====

The robbery itself lasted four minutes.

They walked into the bank in office clothes. ID lanyards. Plastic smiles. One man held the door open for a pensioner leaving. Another apologised to a cashier for interrupting her morning.

No masks. No shouting. No smashing.

The manager understood immediately when Martin calmly showed him a photo, not a weapon, not violence. Just the manager’s own car outside his house, taken the day before.

“You’re not in danger,” Martin said gently.  
“Not unless you make it complicated.”

Drawers opened. Bags filled. A final “thank you for your cooperation.”

They left as customers entered.

Outside, a cyclist nearly clipped Gary and apologised. Gary apologised back.

Then they drove away…

…at thirty.

They stopped at a pedestrian crossing.

Within ten minutes they were another vehicle in traffic.  
Within twenty they were nobody.

===

Detective Sergeant Elaine Harper didn’t arrive to sirens. The job was already over. No dramatic aftermath, just shaken staff and paperwork.

“What did they say?” she asked the receptionist.

“Honestly… they were nice,” the woman said, embarrassed. “One of them even thanked me for telling him where the toilets were.”

Harper paused.

“Where the toilets were?”

“Yes.”

It was the first odd thing.

Calm criminals don’t ask directions inside a place they’ve carefully planned. That meant someone had been inside before — casually.

So Harper didn’t hunt robbers.

She hunted visitors.

===

Three days before the robbery a fire alarm inspection had taken place. A subcontracted technician had signed the visitor book.

The postcode on the form was wrong.

Not fake.

Wrong.

A liar invents details.  
A hurried person writes something almost true.

So Harper pulled a list of men living near that postcode who fit the age range and had small past offences, theft, fraud, minor dishonesty. Not professionals. Just capable.

It gave her a handful of names.

She didn’t arrest anyone.

She waited.

===

Meanwhile, the gang celebrated by *not* celebrating.

No holidays. No spending sprees. No disappearing acts. Life continued exactly as before, which Martin considered their masterpiece.

But humans run on routine.

Gary still visited his brother every Thursday.  
Tom still played darts every Friday.  
Liam still went to the same café.

And Martin knew success was the dangerous part.

“Stop looking pleased,” he told Liam one morning as news of the robbery played above the café counter.

“I’m not.”

“You’re glowing.”

Across the room a woman glanced at Liam, not suspiciously, just noticing.

Martin didn’t like noticing.

===

Harper’s second clue wasn’t a camera.

It was silence.

Phones constantly talk to nearby masts, not precise tracking, just presence. During the exact four-minute robbery window, several regular daily phones near the bank vanished briefly. Switched off or left elsewhere.

People don’t randomly disappear from the digital world at 10:18am on a weekday.

She cross-referenced the missing devices with her postcode shortlist.

Four names overlapped.

Gary’s was one of them.

Still not proof.

Just probability tightening.

===

 

So she watched.

Not dramatic stakeouts, time. Paperwork. Patience.

She mapped movements. Humans orbit the same places: homes, pubs, gyms, relatives. Alone it meant nothing. Together it formed shape.

Gary visited the same house weekly.  
Another man from the list appeared on the same street but never entered.  
A third encountered both of them separately, but never together.

Careful men avoiding coincidence.

Too careful.

Then she saw Martin.

In the café.

He walked in, ordered coffee, stood two metres from Liam, and neither acknowledged the other.

Strangers ignore each other naturally.

But only people who know each other extremely well can ignore each other that deliberately.

Harper finally had a theory.

She still waited.

===

The final piece was almost boring.

Forensics didn’t find fingerprints or dramatic DNA. They found paper dust, fibres from a specific packaging sack.

Only two wholesalers nearby sold that type.

One had a recent cash purchase.

The shop’s car park camera showed Gary’s car.

Not the bank.

The shop.

It was enough.

Warrants followed.

===

Three months after the robbery Martin stood at a supermarket self-checkout buying bread and milk when a man beside him politely showed a badge.

“Morning. Mind coming with us for a chat?”

No shouting.  
No chase.

Outside, Gary was already sitting in a police car.

Gary shrugged. “Didn’t even run a red light.”

Martin almost laughed.

Because now he understood.

They hadn’t been caught by speed, cameras, or a heroic witness.

They’d been caught by small things:

a polite question about toilets  
a nearly correct postcode  
ten minutes of missing phones  
carefully separated friendships  
a familiar café  
and a bag bought from the wrong shop

No single clue solved the crime.

Time did.

You can act ordinary for a day.  
You can even act ordinary for months.

But you cannot out-ordinary an entire world that quietly records patterns forever.

The quietest job in Merseyside wasn’t undone by a chase.

It was undone by patience.",1,1771174148.0,shortstories,3,1.0,False

Andy awoke to knocking on the double doors outside the bunk room. He scrambled to get up and put on some undergarments, pants and a shirt. Only then did it strike Andy what an odd setup the house was. Unless a guest already knew about the door to the den on the other side of the house, they would have to go through a set of communal bunks to get to the main floor.

*Not a very privacy-centric layout.*

Andy slowly opened the door, peering outside.

A short, stout man with a scraggly beard sans mustache, dressed in deep purple robes and a wide-brimmed yellow hat, stood smiling widely. He carried a large, leather satchel at his side. “Hello!” he said. “My name is Percival, and I’m from the Enchanter’s College. I am here for the sigil installation.”

“Ah yes,” Andy said, opening the door. “Come on in. We’ll head up these steps here.”

Andy guided the stout man through the bunks. Noel and Pliny were both out cold, snoring up a storm.

“Sleeping soundly,” Percival said in a whisper, smiling sincerely as they ascended the steps. He drug his hand across the railing. “And beautiful craftsmanship on this staircase.”

The man seemed fascinated by every detail of the house, his gaze moving up and down the den wall. “What a *magnificent* collection of weapons… And are you simmering perpetual stew? How quaint. This is a positively *lovely* home. How long have you had it?”

“Oh,” Andy said, “It’s not mine. It belongs to–”

“Percival, I take it?” Morwen said, emerging from the pantry, “Pleased to meet you. My name is Morwen.” She extended her hand.

“Ah yes, Morwen,” Percival extended his hand, grasping hers warmly. “I was just telling this young man, I admire your collection of weaponry.”

“Thank you,” Morwen said. “I’ve collected many pieces over the years. Can I offer you some coffee?”

“Oh, that would be *delightful*,” Percival said.

Andy fetched the coffee pot from the grate on the fireplace and poured a cup for the **Enchanter**, handing it to him.

“Thank you very much, sir,” he said, taking it and sipping deeply.

“Now, Lilly tells me you need a room where speaking can occur without fear of prying, magical or otherwise. Is that correct?”

“That is correct,” Morwen said. “Lilly speaks very highly of you, and she assures me that you are sympathetic to the Order’s cause.”

Andy watched the two of them. Percival smiled sincerely, eager to be of service, as Morwen eyed him up and down.

*She’s ensuring he’s trustworthy…*

“Ok,” she said, finally. “Could you follow me up the ladder here? Andy, you can come along too.”

“Certainly,” said Percival, following Morwen as she ascended the ladder to her quarters.

Andy followed behind, emerging to the third story of the house, which he hadn’t yet seen.

There was a simple bed, made tidily, a small dresser with a water basin on it, a desk with a quill and some papers and a wooden chair. In the corner, there was a small bookshelf filled with books, not big, scholarly tomes, but rather small ones. Beside the small bookshelf, there were two comfortable-looking armchairs, and an oil-burning lamp on the side table.

“What lovely quarters if you don’t mind me saying,” said Percival.

Other than a gentle nod, Morwen remained stoic. Andy noticed that she was holding back to some degree… was she nervous about this man? Or about having people in her personal space?

“I’d like this room to be completely sealed for private conversation,” she said.

“Very good, very good,” said Percival. “It is certainly achievable. Do you have the requisite ground quartz and stone tablet? Lilly assured me that she would pass along my requirements.”

“I do,” Morwen said, heading over to the desk and moving some papers around. She lifted a circular stone tablet, placing it on the floor before the enchanter, and produced a small bag, handing it to him.

The enchanter opened the drawstring of the bag, looking inside. He took a pinch of finely-ground powder, tasting a bit. “Yes, yes, this is correct. And very high quality. This shouldn’t take long at all.” He raised his eyebrows and grinned. “Where would you like the sigil mounted?”

“Where do you suggest?” Morwen said.

“Well, anywhere in this room will do. The sigil will cover a spherical area with a radius of twenty feet. The entire room should be covered, as well as a significant portion of the second floor, too.”

“Very good,” Morwen said. “How about we place it underneath the bed to keep it inconspicuous.”

“Ah, that will work just fine,” Percival said. “But, if you *truly* want it to be inconspicuous, may I recommend under the dresser? The bed is always the first place **Wizards** and other people with arcane experience look for sigils.”

“Sure,” Morwen said. “Andy, could you help me adjust the dresser?”

Andy nodded and joined Morwen at the dresser, lifting it off the ground and moving it a few feet. It was quite heavy, fully loaded with clothes and whatever else she kept in it. A few days ago, it might have been difficult to handle, but after achieving a rank in **\[athletics\]**, it wasn’t a problem for him.

The **Enchanter** placed the stone tablet on the ground and kneeled on the floor. He reached into a satchel at his side and retrieved a small brush and a glass jar full of a white paste.

He dipped his brush in, and began to paint a small circle around the circumference of the tablet. He took a while, dabbing here and there, making lines and curves all over the face of the stone before placing his brush and paste back in his bag.

Finally, he took the satchel of ground quartz and sprinkled it across the face of the stone tablet.

“Okay,” he said. “This adhesive dries relatively quickly, so I am going to blow the excess dust off and then I’ll perform the enchantment.”

Morwen nodded.

Percival bent low to the ground, placing his face beside the surface of the stone. With a great inhale let out a gust of breath, blowing the quartz dust off of the stone tablet. The only dust that remained was held in place by the adhesive. It formed a beautiful, intricate sigil.

“Very good,” said Percival. He sat up, cross-legged, gazing down at the sigil before him. He reached into his satchel and produced a small crystal. “I brought a little extra juice,” he said, smiling.

He held the crystal in his left hand and placed his right hand on the stone tablet. As Percival sank into a deeper and deeper trance, the crystal in his hand began to glow.

Percival’s beard and robes began to wave eerily, as if in zero gravity, and the loose quartz dust began to hover two or three inches off the ground.

Then, the quartz dust that formed the sigil on the tablet began to glow, dimly at first, and then brightly.

“I cast **{silent sphere}** in perpetuity,” Percival said in a voice not much louder than a whisper. “I bind and consecrate this sigil in the service of silence.”

The sigil glowed brightly, finally emitting a blinding white light before going dim. Percival’s hair and robes fell back down to their customary obedience to the laws of gravity, and the loose quartz dust fell back to the ground.

Percival breathed in deeply and exhaled before standing up. He looked down at the sigil. It pulsed gently with rose-colored light.

“Splendid!” said Percival. “The sigil has taken the spell, and should cast it in perpetuity for as long as the charge continues.”

“How long is that?” Morwen asked.

“Well, with the quality of quartz dust you supplied, and with the magicke crystal I used, I’d estimate somewhere between five and ten years.”

“Wow,” Morwen said. “Not bad.”

“As long as the rose light pulses, it is active, so if there’s ever any doubt, just make sure that the sigil is still glowing.”

“Thank you, Percival,” said Morwen, “I appreciate it.”

Andy and Morwen moved the dresser back over the sigil, returning it to its original place, before they all descended down the ladder.

In the den, Morwen reached into her coin purse. “What do I owe you for your services?” She asked.

“Oh heavens, no,” Percival said, raising his hands in friendly protest. “It’s a *pro bono* job. I admire the spirit of the Order of the Behemoth, and I owe Lilly a favor. I couldn’t possibly accept payment. Besides, you supplied your own materials.”

“And you supplied an expensive-looking magicke crystal,” Morwen shot back.

“Well, I’ll tell you what,” Percival said, glancing at the fireplace. “I will accept a bowl of perpetual stew, a glass of something refreshing, and some company while I eat.”

Morwen raised her eyebrows in surprise and amusement. “We can do that,” she said.

“Excellent!” Percival said, plopping down into an armchair.

Morwen disappeared into the pantry, returning with a glass of dark ale, an inch or two of dark foam topping the drink.

Andy retrieved a bowl, a spoon, a napkin, and a ladle before returning to the fireplace. He served Percival a generous portion of stew.

“Oh, just lovely,” he said, accepting the bowl and the glass. “I am just absolutely tickled at my luck today.” He took a heaping spoonful of stew, slurping on it with delight.

“I hope you like it,” Andy said. “I’ve been keeping this fire going for a few days now.

“It is just *splendid*,” Percival said. “And it is just *perfectly* seasoned.”

Ordinarily, Andy would take these compliments with a grain of salt, but Percival seemed genuinely delighted with the bowl of stew.

The **Enchanter** took a gulp of the ale. “And this stout pairs just *perfectly* with it. Such a depth of flavor. My compliments to the chef… and to the brewer!” He bellowed with laughter.

Morwen took a seat beside him. “So, how long have you been with the Enchanter’s College?” She asked, making polite conversation.

“Ah, many decades, now,” he said. “Affiliate faculty. Gives me flexibility and keeps me from too much scrutiny.”

“Scrutiny?” Andy asked.

“Ah, well, you know, all Cresthaven institutions are subject to at least some amount of oversight from the Supreme Ministry. But affiliate faculty members are treated like absolute *scum*. We teach the introductory courses that the full-time faculty disdain, and we don’t qualify for pensions.”

“Sounds… terrible, actually,” Morwen said. “Aren’t professors supposed to be prestigious?”

“It’s a myth!” Percival said, laughing with a jolly grin. “Everyone who actually *works* at a college, or at least at my college, knows that the institution depends on the underpaid labor of affiliate **Enchanters** hired on annual contracts.” He took another sip of beer. “But, you see, it’s a double edged sword.”

“How’s that?” Andy asked.

Percival slurped another spoonful of stew and hummed with delight. “Well, I don’t have to attend faculty meetings. I don’t have to advise new **Enchanters**. I only have to show up to my lecture hall, three days per week, for two hours each day. And with that, I gain access to their library, their workshops, their laboratories, and their other facilities. If I were trying to make my entire living from teaching, well, forget it. But as an **Enchanter**, I can do plenty of private jobs and get by just fine. Plus, I prefer to lend my services to clients whom… neither the nobility nor the college would approve of.”

“Well, we certainly appreciate your help,” Morwen said.

“It truly is no problem at all,” Percival said. “As I mentioned, I owed Lilly a favor, and I got a delicious bowl of stew!”

Percival made some more small talk with Morwen, naming people, places, and things that Andy had no idea about. He made himself useful by clearing Percival’s dishes. The cheerful **Enchanter** met Andy’s service with gratitude and joy.

Finally, Percival departed. Morwen saw him out the den door and down the path, bidding him farewell.

“Well,” Morwen said as she entered the den again. “We’ve got a safe room, now.”

“Sounds like we have a safe room and a half,” Andy said. “Percival mentioned the radius was twenty feet. It probably covers the den, too.”

“Good point,” Morwen said. She looked above her head, pointing straight upward. “It’s there, about ten feet away. Yes, we should be covered now.” She leaned back in her chair, exhaling. “What a relief.”

\*\*\*

The evening came. Pliny and Noel joined Andy and Morwen in the dining room for some after-dinner cards, a game very similar to rummy.

Noel’s shipment still had not come. “I wonder what’s holding it up,” Noel mused absentmindedly between hands. “It must be arriving tomorrow.”

A grim look crossed Pliny’s face as he collected the cards and shuffled, but he held his tongue, at least for a few more hands.

Finally, Noel excused himself and retired.

The moment Noel left earshot, Pliny looked at Morwen and whispered harshly. “They’ve taken advantage of him. They’ve denied him his due payment. I’m tired of waiting around, can’t we find these swindlers?”

Morwen nodded to Pliny, not so much in agreement as in acknowledgement of his frustration. “Let’s give it a couple more days. It’s possible that Noel is right and the shipment is simply delayed. You know how these things go.”

“I need to talk to him about–” Pliny began.

“Let him save face,” Morwen said. “If you embarrass him about his handling of the situation and the shipment comes in a day or two, you’ll do more harm than good.”

Pliny huffed.

Andy could tell Pliny meant well, but that he was beginning to lose his temper. He wondered how many times he had been stiffed on the job, or how many times he had seen Noel taken advantage of. He could tell Pliny’s instincts came from a good place, but ultimately, Morwen’s attitude made more sense. No need to stir the pot so soon.

“Let’s give it until the end of the week,” Morwen said. “And if it doesn’t arrive, we’ll find the adventuring party and… make a gentle suggestion that they settle their outstanding debts.”

Toronto 1L Recruit - I know there's a lot of discussion on whether networking is worth it for Bay St. My impression is that if you have straight As, firms will interview you. But if you have a mix of As and Bs, my impression is that networking can help get you an interview. Given that you cannot predict your grades, I'd urge you to network at least a little. But also, if your grades are below what a firm wants, no amount of networking will help. 

NYC Recruit: It was earlier than ever - starting in november but most offers and interviews went out after grades. My impression is that there are more Canadians than ever with NYC offers this year - a large chunk of my classmates got interviews, and a solid chunk got offers. Also, NYC interviews from a lot of schools - not just UofT (but UofT still gets the most interviews). I think the same principle applies - if you have all A's, you'll get an interview without networking - but I have seen straight-B students land interviews with the help of a partner who recommended them to HR after a successful coffee chat. 

Interviewing: If you've got free time this summer maybe work on this idk - the amount of ppl with great grades but lack the ability to hold an engaging conversation is ... shocking. No, you dont need to pay someone thousands of dollars to teach you how to interview - the 2Ls will help you for free...maybe buy them lunch after.

1r5jcaw,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r5jcaw,Episode 2x6: Parallels between Dr. Trinity Santos and NP Donnie Donahue,"I've attached two GIFs from episode 6 to illustrate the parallels associated with the ways both Donnie and Trinity attempted to alleviate their exhaustion/tiredness/sleepiness.

Before I get started, I need to include a reminder from episode 1 because once Dr. Robby arrived at the hospital, the first person he engaged in conversation with was Donnie.  Donnie told him he hadn't been getting any sleep because of his newborn daughter and Dr. Robby told him that he would be back from his sabbatical before his daughter sleeps through the night.

Fast forward to episode 6 and we see Donnie drinking multiple cups of coffee, eating donuts and him preparing to go outside so that he could buy a hotdog from the Wiener World Truck.  Princess asked him how many cups of coffee he'd drank but he told her don't judge him.  When the donuts arrived, Dana was trying to ask him about a patient and even though he responded, he headed straight to the donuts so he could get one.  Also, when he asked Dr. Langdon if he wanted a hotdog, Frank asked him, ""*Didn't I just see you eating a donut?*"" and he replied, ""*Don't judge*.""

In this same episode, even though Trinity wasn't showing signs of being sleepy earlier during their shift, by the noon hour, it was evident she was having issues with staying awake.  She dozed off while Dr. Whitaker was trying to talk to her about Louie.  Later, she literally dozed off again while both Dr. Robby and Dr. Al-Hashimi were asking her about not proofreading the chart that included the AI errors.

I think Donnie is drinking coffee and eating to stay awake and he's getting a sugar and a caffeine rush.  While, Trinity got her boost of energy from the 5-hour energy drink Perlah gave her so that she could stay awake.

It appears the show is highlighting the long hours and the lack of sleep both the doctors and nurses experience and it was further addressed with Lena, the night charge nurse.  She's a death doula for Roxie, the patient with bone cancer and when she entered the patient's trauma room in episode 5, she said after she got off night shift, she was in the shower and she didn't hear her phone ringing.  She hadn't been to sleep and now in episode 6, Dr. Robby asked her to stay and help out with the Westbridge patients and it appears she decided to do it.

The ferry was the exact temperature he imagined old people found most pleasant, but he still held the cup with both hands. Like the outside chill had settled into his skin and needed some extra nudging to move on. While there were a handful of locals on the ferry, and even a couple off-worlders, he found it hard to judge their actual ages. 

Outside the quaint porthole, which he didn’t quite trust to be an affectation, rather than an actual indication of the ferry's capabilities, the horizon started dropping ever so slowly. The cerulean atmosphere turning a pale slate. The trip back up to this world's only station would take a leisurely hour at least. He leaned back and glanced beneath the ceramiplast table. There Mango, his black, brown and white furred not-quite-dog pretended to sleep, though one eye was ever so slightly slitted open. 

He wiped one hand across the table, pushing some crumbs onto the floor, where Mango quickly found them. The lazy thing didn’t even bother standing up though, opting instead for some ridiculous sideways licking that seemed spectacularly ineffective. They had spent the better part of the last days walking long stretches of empty beach and dunes, and a pleasant fatigue had made itself known in his muscles. He suspected the dog was feeling pretty much the same. As far as assignments go, this had probably been as close to a holiday as they had had in the past decade. 

The shadow his cup cast on the table's surface seemed to deepen fractionally for a second, and he turned back to the porthole. It could have been anything, a passing cloud bouncing the old star’s light back, a stray reflection off one of the ferry’s many antennas. A very sensitive standard-spec eye, or eye-stalk for that matter, would have scarcely noticed the change at all. His eyes were far from standard-spec though. He widened his pupils and analyzed the unexpected luminance, a full parameter modelling algorithm in his twin-mind rushing through the potential origins before settling with over 96 percent certainty on one in particular. Nuclear detonation, nearly on the other side of the planet, class 5 at least. 

He sighed, and eyed his coffee with more regret than it rightfully deserved. The idiots couldn’t wait. He was nearly gone, and they couldn’t have waited the couple of hours it’d taken for him to get on the fast-mover. He stood up, and pulled the neon-yellow reflective vest from his backpack. As he threw it on, it tightened and strapped itself across his chest and back. It felt like coming home, and his earlier bout of nostalgia melted away. 

Below the table Mango let out a low growl. The perhaps not so elderly locals seemed to have all stood up at the same time. Now at their full height, their five-jointed limbs revealed patches of white keratin plating clearly marking them as upper-caste enforcers. They had produced some fairly menacing looking armaments with surprising swiftness. Barrel-ends all pointed at him.

Mango barked once, and in response the ferry’s long compromised small-mind violently pumped out the cabin's air. Good boy. The majority of the enforcers, not even wearing semi-autonomous armor, fell to their knees and clutched their abdominal vents, desperately trying to keep in whatever air they had stored. The few who were quick enough to engage their suits were pulling their weapons triggers in vain, looking increasingly bewildered. At least, he liked to imagine that was what the frantic mandible movements meant.

“Now, now fellas, none of that please.” the human Emergency Responder said as he wagged a finger at them. “No need for vio-”

Two of them simply exploded. A mist of green and blue gore spread through the cabin, as Mango had apparently reacted to some perceived threat beyond the clearly compromised guns. He eyed the dog skeptically, maybe it hadn’t really enjoyed the beach walks after all.

He thought for a second. Though they could steer the ferry back without issue, the thing truly was incompetent, and its glacial speed had been its actual top speed. He turned back to the porthole and gave it a firm kick. Instead of breaking the window, as he had intended, the better part of the wall was blasted out into the near-vacuum of the upper atmosphere. The little air that had still been in the cabin rushed out in a glittering cloud of crystallized vapors. Only his ER suit kept him in place, anchoring him with fungispikes through the fake-wood floor and straight into the ferry’s foametal frame.

He coughed apologetically and leaned over the edge, trusting the suit to keep him from tipping over. The world below still looked quiet and peaceful. But he knew that the caste-war that had now broken out on the far-side of the planet would spread like an all consuming wildfire. Waving Mango over he prepared to jump. He took one more deep breath, and couldn’t help a small smile from forming. Time to go to work. 

He gave the mental command to release the suits hold and let himself fall out through meters wide hole in the hull. Though he couldn’t see it himself, he knew the red and white crosses that made up the oversized H on the back of the reflective vest would be pulsing a familiar message in multi-spectrum bands.

This might sound niche, but I’ve been going down a rabbit hole and can’t unsee it.

In India, we talk a lot about productivity, focus, screen addiction, team bonding, and “quality time.” But we barely talk about how adults actually spend quiet, collective leisure time.

Jigsaw puzzles exist here, but they’re mostly seen as kids’ toys or one-time timepass. There’s no real conversation around them. No opinions. No nerdy takes. No culture.

Globally, adult puzzles have quietly evolved into a serious lifestyle category. In the US, Europe, and parts of East Asia, puzzles are treated as design objects, collector items, and even team experiences. People buy them for adults, use them during get-togethers, take them to offsites, and frame them as art. There are discussions around difficulty design, image complexity, ideal team size, completion time, and replay value.

In India, none of this really exists yet.

That gap is what’s interesting to me.

I’m exploring the idea of building a premium, adult-focused jigsaw puzzle brand in India. Not toys. Not mass-market. Something niche, calm, aesthetic, and intellectual.

Very concretely, this is what I’m thinking about:

– puzzles designed for team play, not just solo completion

– puzzles that take multiple sittings and reward patience

– puzzles that can be reused creatively (framed, placed under a coffee table, turned into trays or other functional objects)

– thoughtful packaging that prevents lost pieces and feels intentional

– designs that feel classic and minimal, more like a design brand than a toy brand

– limited editions and collections rather than endless SKUs

I’m inspired by international brands that make puzzles feel like objects you’re proud to own, not something you hide in a cupboard. I’m also inspired by brands like Mokobara that started niche, focused on aesthetics and quality, and slowly built a very specific audience.

I’m not trying to build a mass business. I’m curious whether a small but passionate market exists for something like this in India.

Before I go any further, I want honest input.

Would you ever buy a premium puzzle like this?

– for your own home

– as a gift

– for a team or office setting

If not, why?

Too niche? Too expensive? Too slow? Doesn’t fit how Indians relax?

What would make a puzzle feel worth paying for?

Design? Difficulty? Reusability? Social aspect?

And most importantly, do you think your friends would find this interesting, or would it be a hard sell?

I’m less interested in validation and more interested in understanding how people here think about leisure, focus, and collective thinking. If you have strong opinions, skepticism, or even reasons this would fail, I’d genuinely like to hear them.

2. The worst customer service I've experienced have consistently been at small businesses. It's clear the business owner is incapable of training people or the business owner is rude themselves. 

3. The prices are often more ""luxury"" but what you're getting in return is okay at best and sometimes downright awful. I've never been to a local coffee shop that wasnt mediocre as hell.

""They're fresh, right? I'll have it untoasted."" She confirmed they were fresh.

And they only cream-cheesed one side of the bagel (crime), so my paper-thin tomato was abut a cold, stale bagel top. 

And it was cut unevenly. And TBH it was kind of small for the price point. And the rise on the bagel wasn't very good. And the $4 drip coffee was weak.

All Woodsmen are to bring tools of the trade. All other taskings to be put on sideline for today..""

My first taught was Sino is awake. Started the coffee machine and washed up. Went downstairs. Prepared 3 to go cups of coffee. 

Met Elosabeth at the door and handed her a coffee. We walked to the Inn. Aino joined us looking tired handed him a cup.

Marcus brought a box of work gloves. He told Aino showing a Lidar image of the train yard. ""Amazing how fast the forest regrew. In that area we will clear first. "" showing a space next to yard beside the new building.. ""The Chipper here"" showing a space beside where the build egg crates..

Aino said ""ok today we have 2  accomodation cars being picked up from the station by our shuttles. All prisoners and workers will be picked up first.. Marcus which part of the yards is already cleared.""

""About this much."" He showed on Lidar. 

Aino: ""ok when the shuttle get back get them to unhook wheels on track. Then lower the cars on its wheels. We will need our rail workers there to set them up."" 

As people gathered outside we went to join them. 

Aino: ""the first train cars coming in today. Sgt Major we will need the security team that will watch the prisoners. 

I notice Quary workers here. We will need granite chips for repairs and building of railroad. You can go to Quarry.

Kitchen staff and butcher please provide cool drinks and sandwitches for the work crew and make meals for all those coming today from space for supper. Butchers we need a lot of sandwitch meat cut. You can get started.

Drivers see Marcus. He will assogn you to one of 3 things to haul. Logs will go to Lumber yard to be cut later. Brush and branches to the egg crate manufacture. Last of trucks will be any other items like old bricks and refuse. We will put this in this area as it is out of way and will not be visible.

Woodsmen will go first cutting any tree obstructions. All trees branches cut off. Once one area completed will move to next area.

Train workers check the tracks and be available when the cars arrive to assemble them.

We need everybody to help load the trucks and clean the tracks. See Marcus for instructions.

Any Questions?"" 

Elisabeth asked. ""Can a gardening crew come with me to get small sapling and replant them on the edge of the train yard?"" Aino said ""sure""

I went to the warehouse and we picked up showels. I am getting better at manual labour but Elisabeth would put us to shame. 

A bunch of gardeners joined us. We went to work. 

We stopped to see the cars coming down. In no time at all the first two cars were on tracks in the yards.

The shuttles landed on their pads. Escort guided the prisoners to work beside our volunteers after getting glaves.

Lunch time the kitchens brought folding tables and set up trays of sandwitches and other food.

Working all together we cleared up the trainyards. We stayed away from the main group as we were planting trees.

The Kitchen car now finished was moved to the accomodation cars. The Lidar tower raised 

Aino pulled me away just before Supper. I was asked to introduce his noble contact to the Inn where he made a reservation.

He informed me tomorrow will start the transfer of all railroad repair equipment. It will take a week for all the equipment to be here.

After his lunch I walked him around Newtown. He took notes and questioned the ones running the restaurants. 

That took up all afternoon. I was able to get the new bus to his shuttle after. We did stop at the bakery last and he bought a sample box.

He had a chat with Marcus at his shuttle and the discuss how the drop off would work 

He thanked me for the tour and bad us farewell.

All but prisoners broke at supper time and got washed up. Well washed up is an exageration. Many of us went for a swim.

Headed home to rest. Elisabeth replanted 50 trees already.

Woodsman will start clearing from the yards out tomorrow. The train bed will start being repaired and the start of this new project starts.

As soon as we receive the locomotive the Railroad workers will finish assembling it.

Start of laying down the tracks will be by hand until the train is ready by workers and prisoners.

Early bed tonight. Need to get back to the books tomorrow.

Of I forgot a shipment of apples will go to the jam makers tomorrow morning before they have to be used for unloading the equipment.

1r5j269,https://www.reddit.com/r/toRANTo/comments/1r5j269/tipping_needs_an_overhaul/,Tipping needs an overhaul!,"Ok so I come from a country where tipping is not the norm however I’ve always known about the US tipping culture and always followed suit 

So moving to Canada many years ago I have always tipped 15% and above but recently like many people I ammm frustrated that wherever you go for any service you’re presented with tip options and feel obliged to tip out of embarrassment 

I’ve wanted to put an end to this mentally but here are some thoughts

1) in a cafe/coffee shop for take out - why do we tip when we pay? I would prefer the option to tip after I’ve received my drink. Reason: this just happened to me yesterday: I visited a fancy new cafe called lost in Tokyo. I decided this is where I was going to exercise my no tip for take out since the last few times I tipped 15% just to be handed something out of a fridge or something very basic that pissed me off 

Anyways the drink I ordered ended up taking quite a few step more than just pressing a button that a coffee would so in that case instantly felt guilty about not tipping but then felt too embarrassed to bring up paying for a tip after I got my drink - plus I don’t carry cash or coins 

2) delivery services - why on earth should be my tip % be based on order value? The delivery driver is simply transported packaged food from one to another. I can definately understand a huge order for multiple people would take a lot of space so there’s an argument for that but In my case I live alone, sometimes my order is $20 sometimes it’s $$60/70 for the same portion size of food. Why should my tip % be different then

I think a better approach would be if the screen suggested a tip amount based on distance from place, number of items can indicate a bigger tip should be given and also something about the weather eg during the storm (not saying any of these should be mandatory but suggest a tip on those factors and I would be much happier to oblige)

3) final and most radical though - resteraunts - honestly after thinking about the above points I came to my final conclusion that tipping shouldn’t even be a customer responsibility - I know this has been debated many times but really what the server does is give you good service in hopes of a good tip. Again annoying that tip is based on the bill but I understand because multiple items can cause multiple trips but I’m thinking from my lense of a single diner - where if I choose to treat myself to a fancy night I don’t know why I should tip a waiter more for doing the same thing by they would if I had a regular dinner out. 

The server essentially acts as a sales man but the commission comes from the diner which is or isn’t always guaranteed right 

What if the whole thing was flipped and servers were paid commission by the resteraunt based on how well they sell their most expensive items or how much higher they can get the customers to spend? Unless I’m thinking about it wrong the business would make more and that would go back to the waiter which is the same as if the business didn’t make more but then it just came from the customer instead. In the end, customers would get a better dining experience (minus being pushed to spend more lol) and resteraunts make more and the waiters ideally don’t lose but either make the same or more 

I don’t know if that makes sense but in my head it does

Day 4 and I’m one rogue cough away from starring in my own horror story called “The Great Backup of ‘26.”

If this were real life, I’d be calling it quits and chugging magnesium like it’s happy hour. But since it’s a joke… pray for me, or at least laugh so I don’t cry. 💀🚽😂",6,1771173233.0,UCAT,4,0.88,False

Since our last post, we made a few little changed in our system (for example, we know now that I wasn't much aware while creating other members of the system, because I was just a kid then, so they might be actually more naturally-made than made on purpose like usual definition od ""tulpa""), but the biggest one is that I have finally gotten brave enough and trusted them with our body. 
It started on a math lesson, when one of them (Mettaton) was looking through my eyes. Lately, I was giving them access to some body parts sometimes (for examle tongue, so they can taste what I eat), so that day, he was looking through my eyes (he could see even without that, but in a weird, ""ghost"" perspectice). 
Suddenly, when our teacher was writing exercises on the board, he asked me if he can write in our notebook, because he was bored then. I wanted to give him access only to my hands, but a second later I was like ""You know what? F*ck that, let's give him full access and see how he's going to react."" and then I gave him that full access, despite being afraid of it for so long.
When he realised it, he was rapturous, but at the same time he knew he needs to behave so people around won't notice that I'm not acting like myself. He was joyfully writing in our notebook (at first, he was pressing pen a bit too hard, but then he got used to writing) and even even solved one exercise on the board when teacher asked him to (he was very proud of himself and felt smart).
Later, he drew with pencil a drawing in my English notebook. He drew himself (in his old, box form from Undertale) saving ""hoomans"" from a huge bomb. 
After school, he went to shopping mall, bought coffee in Starbucks—oat milk Cafe Latte (unfortunatelly not caramel latte on oat milk, like some of people might expect from his ""source character""😔)—and to Action shop. He bought me things I needed or might need in the future (for example, our body was having such strong period cramps lately, that I felt like I was literally snapping in half, but I run out of heating pada, so he bought us some) and thanks to him, I have now a red spa band with horns, what I absolutely love.
The worst thing what happened is that he was a bit nervous to speak, because he didn't know how to sound like me (tone) and when teacher asked him something, he panicked and answered her simply with ""no"" (without adding aby other words), do after that some guys from my class were joking about that for a while. But I didn't care much actually, because those were the biggest idiots in our class, it speaks about them, not about us (unintentional reference, I'm sorry).
He's happy he could spend that day like this. He didn't tell me much how happy he is, but I just could feel it, since we share brain. Yesterday was Frank's turn and today is Pale's turn for switching with me, but I guess  this post would be too long to read, so I'm going to tell about all experiences (and they will probably write something too if they want) in few posts, because I'm proud of them and myself.",3,1771173202.0,Tulpas,1,1.0,False

Three days after Horizon Arms, my leg still felt like it didn’t belong to me.

Not in the dramatic way—no phantom limb stuff. Just the plain, annoying reality of healing: tight skin, deep bruising, the staples pulling when I stood too fast, that hot sting when blood started moving through it again after I’d been sitting. The doctor had warned me about infection like he’d seen a hundred guys shrug it off and come back worse. I didn’t shrug it off. I kept it clean. I kept it wrapped. I took the antibiotics on schedule. I did everything you’re supposed to do when you’ve learned the hard way that a hallway can have teeth.

I also did what you’re not supposed to do.

I replayed it until the memory felt worn down at the edges.

The delivery. The pig squeal. The mask. The humming that stayed calm while I was bleeding out. The sign. The preview notification that didn’t “exist” anywhere on my phone once I tapped it.

Detective Ramos had been straight with me. She told me not to go back. She told me to stop taking anonymous jobs. She told me to call if anything changed.

She also told me something I didn’t like hearing because it sounded too close to a warning you give someone right before you lose them.

“He leaves contact,” she said. “He doesn’t like being forgotten.”

“Who is he?” I asked.

“A suspect,” she said. “A pattern. Not a name I can put in your hands yet.”

“What does that mean?” I asked.

“It means we’ve had bodies that match the theme,” she said. “We’ve had survivors who didn’t want to testify, people who disappeared before we could talk to them, and a building full of blind spots the city refuses to take responsibility for. It means we’ve been chasing smoke.”

I went back to my first-floor apartment anyway, because my life isn’t the kind of life where you can just “stay somewhere else” without it becoming a problem you can’t pay for.

Normal didn’t want me.

On the second day, I found the first card taped to my bedroom window.

It was a cheap Valentine’s card. The kind you buy in a pack of thirty-two for kids to hand out in elementary school. Bright red. Cartoon hearts. A stupid little pun on the front.

I didn’t read it at first. I just stared at it through the glass from inside, like it might move.

The tape was clear packing tape, pressed down hard. Whoever put it there had smoothed it flat with their palm.

My window faces the parking lot. There’s a streetlight out there that makes everything look slightly yellow after dark. I could see my own reflection over the card. My face looked tired. My eyes looked wrong.

I peeled the card off with my fingertips.

My hands shook. It made me angry, because I kept telling myself I wasn’t “that guy,” the one who gets spooked by paper. But my body didn’t care about my opinions. My body remembered the hall. It remembered blood on concrete. It remembered the way the humming stopped when I made progress.

Inside the card, in thick black marker:

MY VALENTINE

No signature. No joke. No smiley face.

I called Ramos.

Her tone didn’t change when I told her. That was the first thing that told me she’d seen this before.

“Don’t touch it with bare hands,” she said.

“I already did,” I told her.

“Wash your hands. Soap and hot water,” she said. “Then put the card in a bag or envelope. Don’t lick anything. Don’t throw it out.”

“Why?” I asked.

There was a pause, like she was weighing how much to tell me over the phone.

“We’ve had a couple incidents where people touched something and got… sleepy,” she said, choosing her words carefully. “Could be coincidence. Could be cheap chemicals. Could be nothing. But I don’t gamble with ‘could.’”

Sleepy.

I stared at my hand. It looked normal. It didn’t feel normal. My skin felt like it was buzzing.

An officer came later. He took the card like it was evidence, because it was. He asked if I had enemies. I told him I wasn’t important enough to have enemies.

That night, I slept with my phone plugged in, my lights on, and a kitchen chair wedged under my doorknob like I was a kid home alone and my fear had a furniture budget.

The next morning, there was another card.

Not on my window.

Under my front door.

It had been slid in carefully, not bent, not torn. Like whoever did it wanted me to see it intact.

This one wasn’t a kid’s card. It was thicker paper, glossy. On the front: two pigs in little outfits holding hands inside a heart frame.

My stomach rolled.

Inside, same black marker:

SOON

No one in my building had seen a thing.

That’s the part that made me feel stupid.

I asked my downstairs neighbor—Ms. Lowell—if she’d heard someone in the hallway overnight. She’s retired and wakes up at the slightest sound. She looks at people like she’s trying to decide what they’re made of.

“Honey,” she said, “I didn’t hear a thing.”

I asked the guy across from me, Trevor, if he’d been up late. Trevor always smells faintly like vape juice and microwaved food.

“I got work at six,” he said. “I’m asleep by ten, man. Why?”

I told him someone had been messing with my door. He blinked like he didn’t want to be involved in anything that might require him to speak to police.

“Maybe it’s kids,” he said, and then immediately looked relieved that he’d found an explanation that didn’t include effort.

Kids don’t tape cards to a window at chest height and smooth the tape like they’re sealing a package.

Ramos increased patrols. That’s what she told me. A couple units did passes. One parked down the block for a while. She told me to keep my curtains closed. She told me to stop answering unknown numbers. She told me to put a camera inside my apartment if I could.

I did the cheap version of that: I set my phone up on a bookshelf one night with the camera pointed at the door, plugged in so it wouldn’t die, screen dimmed, hoping it would catch something.

At 2:13 a.m., the phone stopped recording.

No crash message. No low storage warning. It just ended like someone had hit stop.

When I tried to play it back, the last thing it showed was the hallway under my door—silent—and then a blur, like my phone had been bumped. After that, nothing. A black screen and the timestamp still counting up, like it was recording darkness.

Ramos wasn’t impressed. Not because she didn’t believe me—because it fit.

“Half the people we’ve talked to say electronics do weird things around it,” she said. “Some of them are lying. Some of them are scared. Some of them… aren’t wrong.”

On day four, I found a card taped to the outside of my kitchen window.

Not the bedroom this time. A different angle. Like someone wanted me to know they could reach any side of me they wanted.

That night, I left my TV on low. I didn’t even watch it. I just needed noise that wasn’t my thoughts.

I fell asleep on my couch around midnight with a blanket half over my legs, my phone on my chest, and my crutch leaning against the coffee table. I remember thinking, right before I drifted off, that my apartment felt too quiet for a building full of people.

I woke up because my mouth tasted like pennies.

It took me a second to realize I was awake. Like I’d been pulled out of sleep too quickly and my brain hadn’t caught up. My tongue felt thick. My limbs felt heavy, the way they do after cold medicine or a couple beers when you shouldn’t have either.

The first thing I noticed was the air.

Not my apartment air.

My place smells like detergent and old carpet and the faint burnt smell from my toaster oven because I always set it too hot. This air smelled like stale carpet and cold concrete and that faint sweet edge underneath.

The same sweet edge from Horizon Arms.

I sat up too fast and my leg screamed. My body tried to follow it with panic and I had to clamp down hard just to keep from yelling.

It was dark, but not fully dark. There was a weak red glow somewhere, and after my eyes adjusted I saw what it was: an EXIT sign at the end of a hallway.

A hallway.

Not my living room.

Not my kitchen.

A hallway with dirty runner carpet and doors on either side.

I was lying on my back on that carpet like someone had dropped me there.

My heart started hammering, and I had that split-second hope that this was a nightmare. That I’d fallen asleep watching TV and my brain was doing the thing brains do when they’re scared.

Then I smelled it again. The metal note. The old air freshener note. The memory locked into the scent. My stomach went cold.

Horizon Arms.

I pushed up onto my elbows. My hands shook so badly my palms slid on the carpet fibers. My mouth was dry. My throat felt raw.

I tried to stand and almost fell. My left leg didn’t want to take weight. The staples were gone now, but the wound was still healing and the muscle didn’t trust anything. Someone had moved me. Someone had carried me. My leg had been handled like luggage.

I looked down at myself.

Same shirt I’d fallen asleep in. Same jeans. No shoes. My socks were dirty now. My phone was gone. My wallet was gone. No crutch.

My mind went straight to the cards. The tape. The “sleepy” comment.

I remembered peeling the first card off my window with bare hands and thinking it was just paper.

I swallowed hard, forcing my breathing to slow.

Panic gets you killed fast. That’s not a motivational quote. It’s just true. If I started running blind, I’d fall. If I fell, I’d bleed. If I bled, I’d be stuck.

I listened.

No voices. No footsteps. No radio. No sirens. Just the building settling, faint, and my own breathing too loud.

I pushed myself up and leaned against the wall.

The hallway looked like the twelfth floor.

Same weak red EXIT sign. Same doors. Same carpet. Same lack of daylight. But it was hard to be sure. Buildings repeat themselves. That’s how they’re built.

I limped to the nearest door and tried the handle.

Locked.

The next one.

Locked.

The third.

It opened.

The door swung inward with a soft scrape, and a smell rolled out—old apartment smell, stale water, mildew, something dead a long time ago. The room was dark. I felt along the wall until my hand hit a light switch.

Nothing happened.

Of course it didn’t.

I stepped inside anyway.

The floor was uneven with debris. I moved slow, feeling with my feet. My eyes adjusted enough to make out shapes: a kitchen counter, a sink filled with something black and dried, cabinets hanging open. A living room with an empty space where a couch might’ve been, and a stain on the wall like something had burned there.

I wasn’t searching for comfort. I was searching for something sharp.

A weapon.

I found a bathroom. The mirror above the sink was cracked, a spiderweb of fractures. The lower corner had already been smashed out. Shards lay on the counter.

I crouched and picked up the biggest piece I could find.

Jagged edge. Sharp enough to cut.

I set it down, grabbed the hem of my shirt, and ripped.

The fabric tore with a sound that was too loud in the quiet.

I wrapped the cloth around the base of the shard, twisting it tight to make a grip. It wasn’t pretty. It wasn’t stable. But it gave me something to hold that wouldn’t slice my palm open the first time I moved.

A makeshift knife.

My hands were shaking so badly I had to take a second just to squeeze and make sure I could still grip it.

I limped out and pulled the apartment door almost shut behind me, leaving it cracked. Not because I thought it would hide me. Because a fully open door is a signal. A crack could at least make someone hesitate.

My heart thumped in my throat.

I didn’t know where I was. I didn’t know how far the stairwell was. I didn’t know if the hallway was a dead end on one side and a trap on the other.

Then I heard it.

Humming.

Soft at first, so faint I thought it might be the building settling in some weird way.

Then clearer, closer.

A steady tune, calm, like someone with time.

I backed into the shadow of the cracked door, pressing myself against the wall inside the apartment. I held the mirror shard close to my chest, trying not to breathe loud.

Footsteps, soft on the carpet, not rushed.

I peeked through the crack.

At first I saw nothing. Just darkness and the weak red glow.

Then he came into view.

Tall. Thin. Hoodie. Jeans. Boots.

Pig mask.

The same pinkish rubber, the same snout, the same glossy black eye holes.

He walked like he wasn’t afraid of anything in that building. Like he owned the air.

The humming didn’t break rhythm.

He passed my door without looking at it, and for one stupid second my brain tried to grab hope from that. Like maybe he didn’t know where I was.

Then he stopped.

Right outside the door.

The humming continued, lower now, like he was humming to himself more than into the air.

He tilted his head.

Slowly, like he could hear my heartbeat through the wall.

I gripped the shard so hard the cloth creaked.

If he opened the door, I’d have no room to react. I’d be trapped between the bathroom and the kitchen with no exit.

My brain went cold and clear in a way it hadn’t since the first time I saw him.

Ambush.

Not because I was brave. Because I didn’t have other options.

I stepped toward the doorway, putting my shoulder near the frame. I set my feet as best I could with my leg. I kept my body pressed tight to the wall so I’d be out of sight until the last second.

The humming stopped.

Silence hit hard.

Then the door began to open.

Slowly.

The crack widened by inches. Light didn’t spill in because there was no real light, just the faint red smear from the EXIT sign.

The pig mask appeared in the gap.

The snout. The empty eye holes.

He didn’t push the door all the way at first. He paused with it half open, like he was letting me decide.

I moved.

I lunged out of the shadow and drove the mirror shard forward with both hands.

The shard hit something soft.

The mask.

It didn’t stab through like flesh. It scraped hard across rubber and caught at the edge of an eye hole. I felt it snag. I jerked, trying to drive it deeper.

He reacted fast.

His hand shot up and grabbed my wrist. His grip was strong, shockingly strong for someone who looked thin. The cold panic hit again—this wasn’t a normal guy in a mask doing a prank.

I twisted, trying to wrench free, and the mirror shard slipped, slicing along the edge where the mask met skin.

For a split second, I saw real skin under the rubber. Pale. Human.

He made a sound.

Not words. Not a scream.

A quick wet inhale, like surprise.

Then he slammed the door into me.

The edge hit my shoulder and bounced me back into the apartment. Pain sparked down my arm. I stumbled, my bad leg buckling, and I caught myself on the counter with my free hand.

He stepped in.

The humming started again immediately, like he couldn’t help it.

I swung the shard again, aiming lower, toward his throat.

He leaned back just enough to let it pass, then grabbed my forearm and twisted.

White pain shot through my elbow. The shard nearly dropped. I held on by reflex.

He shoved me hard, and I hit the wall. Dust shook loose from the paint and drifted into my face. I coughed and my eyes watered.

I didn’t stop moving.

I went for him again, slashing now instead of stabbing. The shard caught his hoodie and tore fabric. I felt it scrape something underneath.

He didn’t bleed much. Or maybe I just couldn’t see it in the dark.

He reached into his hoodie pocket.

My stomach flipped.

I swung again, and he blocked it with his forearm like he didn’t care if he got cut. The shard bit into fabric and maybe skin.

Then he pulled his hand out.

A knife.

Not a kitchen knife. Not a pocketknife.

A thin blade, longer than my hand, with a dark handle. Made for stabbing.

He held it low, relaxed.

The humming continued.

I backed up, chest heaving.

“I don’t want this,” I said. My voice sounded weak even to me. “I delivered the package. I did what you wanted.”

He tilted his head again.

Then he stepped forward.

I rushed him, because if he got to choose the distance, I was dead. I threw my weight into it, bad leg and all, and slammed into him shoulder-first.

He stumbled back a step.

I drove the shard up toward his neck again.

This time it landed. Not deep, but enough that I felt it slide under the edge of the mask and scrape skin.

He jerked away with a sharp movement, and for a second the mask shifted.

I saw part of his mouth.

Lips pulled tight, not in fear, but in concentration.

He didn’t make a sound.

He just thrust the knife toward me.

I twisted aside and felt the blade catch my shirt, then slip past. If I’d been a half-second slower, it would’ve been my ribs.

We fought like two animals in a small space. No choreography. No clean moves. Just grabbing and shoving and trying to keep the sharp thing pointed away from your important parts.

My leg gave out again and I went down to one knee.

He took advantage instantly.

He kicked my bad leg.

Pain hit so hot I saw stars. I cried out, and the sound echoed off the bare walls.

He stepped in to finish it.

I threw the shard upward blindly.

It hit his mask again, and this time it dug into the rubber near the snout. The shard snapped a piece off. The pig mask cracked.

He jerked back, and the knife hand dipped low.

I grabbed his wrist.

My fingers locked around it, both hands, and I squeezed like my life depended on it.

He tried to wrench free, but I held.

The humming stopped—finally—like it took too much focus to keep it going.

His knife hand trembled. The blade hovered inches from my stomach.

I shoved up with my shoulder and drove him back.

We crashed into something—maybe a table frame, maybe a broken chair—and it snapped under our weight.

I got to my feet, barely.

We were near a window now. I hadn’t even noticed it in the dark. The glass was dirty but intact, and beyond it was night sky and the faint orange glow of streetlights far below.

Twelfth floor.

I knew it in my bones.

He lunged again, and this time I didn’t dodge.

I grabbed him and drove him toward the window with everything I had.

He slashed at me. The blade skimmed my side. Heat, then wetness. Not deep enough to drop me, but enough to remind me what losing feels like.

I shoved again.

He slammed into the window. The glass held.

He raised the knife overhand.

I saw the angle. I saw the intent.

I swung the mirror shard into his wrist.

The glass cut.

He flinched, knife dipping.

I didn’t hesitate. I drove my shoulder into his chest and shoved again.

The window cracked.

A spiderweb raced across it.

Air hissed through the fractures.

He tried to brace, boots scraping on the floor, but there was nothing solid.

I shoved again.

The window gave.

The glass burst outward with a sharp, explosive sound, and cold air slapped my face.

For a split-second, his knife came up.

I felt it.

A hard punch between my shoulder blades.

Not pain at first—just pressure.

Then fire.

He had stabbed me in the back.

The world went tight and bright and narrow.

My hands slipped.

But my momentum was already moving forward, and his balance was already broken.

He went through the shattered window.

For a second, his hands grabbed at the frame. The pig mask looked straight at me, empty-eyed, and I could see his fingers clenched around jagged glass.

Then he slipped.

He fell.

No scream. No flailing.

Just a drop into darkness.

I stumbled back from the window, choking on my own breath. My back screamed. Warmth spread under my shirt. My hands shook so hard I couldn’t make them do anything useful.

I staggered toward the hallway door.

My vision tunneled.

I made it out into the hall and collapsed against the wall, sliding down until I hit the carpet.

I forced myself to move. Forced myself to get my knees under me. Forced myself to crawl, because standing wasn’t happening.

The stairwell was down the hall.

I could see the red EXIT sign like a distant ember.

The building was silent again.

No humming.

No footsteps.

Just my breathing and the wet sound of blood.

I crawled until my arms burned.

When I reached the stairwell door, I shoved it with my shoulder.

It opened.

Thank God.

I tumbled inside and dragged it shut behind me. I didn’t lock it. My hands wouldn’t cooperate. I just leaned against it like my body could be a deadbolt.

I didn’t have my phone.

That hit me like another stab. No phone. No way to call 911. No way to call anyone.

My mind grabbed for options. Screaming. Yelling down the stairwell. Trying to get outside.

I opened my mouth to shout and nothing came out but a dry rasp.

Then I heard something below.

Footsteps. Multiple. Fast.

Voices.

“—this way!”

Flashlights cut up the stairwell, white beams bouncing off the walls.

Police.

Real police.

They came up the stairs fast, two at first, then more behind them. Guns drawn, lights moving. Their faces were tight with urgency like they’d been running toward this, not stumbling into it.

One of them saw me slumped against the door and swore.

“Sir! Hands where I can see them!”

I lifted my hands slowly. My palms were smeared with blood and dust.

“I’m hurt,” I managed.

“We got you,” another voice said. “EMS is right behind us.”

An officer crouched near me, keeping his gun angled away but still ready.

“What happened?” he asked.

“Pig mask,” I said. “He stabbed me. I pushed him out the window.”

The officer’s eyes flicked to his partner.

His partner keyed his radio. “Suspect may be down. Twelfth floor. Window breach. Victim injured, stab wound back.”

I expected disbelief.

Instead, the crouched officer muttered, “About time.”

The paramedics reached me and started working, pulling my shirt up, pressing gauze into the wound, asking me questions I answered in half-sentences.

As they loaded me onto a stretcher, I saw more officers moving past, heading up toward the twelfth floor hallway with purpose, like they knew the layout already.

In the ambulance, the medic leaned close and said, “Stay with me. You’re losing blood but you’re alert. That’s good.”

At the hospital, everything became bright lights and clipped voices and the smell of disinfectant. They patched my back, stitched it, checked for organ damage. They told me I was lucky the blade had missed anything vital.

Lucky.

A word that feels stupid when you’ve been kidnapped and stabbed and you’re lying in a hospital gown with dried blood in your hair.

Ramos came in later.

She looked exhausted. Not the normal tired-cop look. The kind of tired you get when you’ve been chasing something for a long time and it finally trips.

“You’re alive,” she said.

“Barely,” I said.

She nodded, like she accepted that as fair.

“How did I get there?” I asked. “How did he—?”

Ramos sat down, and for the first time since I’d met her, she looked like she was choosing honesty over comfort.

“We pulled your building’s exterior footage again,” she said. “The one camera that still works pointed at the lot.”

My stomach tightened.

“At 1:47 a.m.,” she said, “a guy in a maintenance jacket walks in. Doesn’t look suspicious. Carries a tool bag. He goes to your hallway door like he’s done it before.”

“I didn’t let anyone in,” I said.

“You didn’t,” she said. “That door gets propped sometimes. People smoke. People take trash out. It’s one of those buildings.”

I clenched my jaw.

“He comes out five minutes later with you,” she said. “You’re barefoot. Head down. Looks like you’re half asleep. Like someone guided you without dragging you. That’s why nobody heard a fight.”

My throat went dry.

“You’re saying I walked,” I said.

“I’m saying you weren’t fighting,” she said. “We think you were sedated. We’re waiting on labs from the cards we recovered. Adhesives, ink, whatever he’s using.”

He didn’t carry me like luggage. He turned me into someone who followed.

Ramos continued, “We’ve had other cases with similar footage. Someone who looks like staff. Someone who belongs. That’s how he stayed active. Not by being a ghost. By blending.”

“Did you find him?” I asked. “Down there.”

Ramos’s eyes flicked to the side.

“They’re down there,” she said. “He fell like you said. He’s alive. And he’s in custody.”

“In custody,” I repeated, like my brain couldn’t grab it.

She nodded. “You helped catch him.”

Two uniformed officers came in later with Ramos. They looked at me like I was something between a victim and a witness and a guy they didn’t know how to talk to.

One of them said, “Sir… thank you.”

“For what?” I said, even though I knew.

“For helping us catch him,” he said. “He’s been active every Valentine’s. And the days after. He escalates until he gets what he wants.”

“What he wants,” I echoed.

“Victims,” the other officer said, flat. “He has a pattern. He leaves cards. He forces contact. He takes people to Horizon Arms. We’ve been trying to tie him to it for years.”

Ramos added quietly, “The problem wasn’t that we didn’t suspect. The problem was proof. No cameras inside Horizon Arms. Exterior cams dead half the time. Victims were transient or too scared to testify. And every time we got close, the guy we were watching would vanish into a building with ten exits and a service corridor nobody had on record.”

The uniformed officer said, “We called him the Valentine’s Day murderer in-house. Not official. Just… what he was.”

My skin crawled.

“You knew,” I said.

“We suspected,” Ramos corrected. “We didn’t have him.”

The uniformed officer added, “Some people call him the Piggy Man.”

That name sounded like a campfire dare. It didn’t match the knife in my back.

“We have him now,” Ramos said. “Because you fought back.”

I got released two days later with more stitches and more meds and a discharge packet thick enough to make me want to throw up. Ramos had pulled strings to get me a short-term hotel room under a victim’s assistance program. It wasn’t fancy, but it had locks that worked and people at a front desk who would look up if someone walked in at 3 a.m.

Nolan met me there and sat on the edge of the bed and didn’t talk for a while, because sometimes your friend doesn’t need to fill the silence. Sometimes they just need to be there so you don’t feel like you’re the only human on earth.

“They caught him,” Nolan said finally.

“Yeah,” I said.

“You okay?” he asked.

I laughed once, sharp and humorless. “No,” I said. “But I’m alive.”

For a day, I almost believed it could end there.

They caught him. They had him. The Piggy Man. The Valentine’s Day murderer.

I watched the local news clip on my phone, volume low. They didn’t show his face. They showed the building. They showed police tape. They showed a stretcher being loaded into a van. They said “suspect in custody” and “long-running investigation” and “community relieved.”

Ramos called and said, “He’s talking.”

“About what?” I asked.

“About you,” she said.

My stomach tightened.

“Why?” I asked.

“We don’t know yet,” she said. “But he’s fixated. You need to move.”

I’d already decided that.

The next day I made calls. Looked at listings. Asked Nolan if I could store some stuff at his place. Called my landlord and told him I was breaking the lease and let him yell because yelling meant he was human and predictable and not humming behind a mask.

I went back to my apartment once, in daylight, with Nolan and two officers.

I didn’t want to. But I needed clothes. I needed my laptop. I needed my life in boxes.

The hallway looked the same as it always had. Beige paint. Cheap carpet. Somebody’s cooking smell drifting under a door.

Normal.

We packed fast. Nolan carried most of it because my leg and back were still wrecked. The officers stood in the hall and watched like statues. Ms. Lowell came out once and looked at me with worry and curiosity.

“You be safe,” she said.

“I’m trying,” I told her.

As we left, one of the officers said, “You got any more cards?”

“Not today,” I said.

He nodded, like “today” was the only word that mattered.

I didn’t sleep in that apartment again.

Two nights later, I was in the hotel. I’d finally managed to eat something besides vending machine crackers. I’d finally managed to sit still without flinching at every hallway sound.

I was on my back staring at the ceiling when I heard a faint sound outside my door.

Paper scraping.

Not a knock. Not a footstep.

Just the soft, deliberate sound of something being pushed along carpet.

My whole body went cold.

I didn’t move. I didn’t breathe.

The sound stopped.

Then there was a whisper of paper sliding.

Under the door.

I sat up too fast and pain shot through my back, but fear covered it like a blanket.

I stared at the thin gap under the door.

A corner of white cardstock protruded.

I didn’t touch it with my hands. I grabbed a hotel pen off the nightstand and used it to hook the paper and pull it fully into the room.

It was a Valentine’s card.

Thick paper. Plain front. No cartoon pigs. No glitter.

I opened it with the pen and my thumb, careful like I was disarming something.

Inside, in black marker, the letters clean and steady:

I’LL BE SEEING YOU SOON MY VALENTINE

And at the bottom:

XO

My throat tightened. My ears rang.

I grabbed my phone and called Ramos with hands that shook so badly I nearly dropped it.

She answered on the second ring. “Yeah?”

“It’s here,” I said.

“What’s where?” she asked, already sharper.

“A card,” I said. “Under my hotel door.”

Silence for half a second. Then, “Don’t touch it. Don’t leave the room. Lock the deadbolt. I’m calling it in.”

“I thought you had him,” I said, and my voice cracked.

“We do,” she said, and her voice went flat in a way that made my stomach drop further. “We have the man we arrested.”

I stared at the card on the bedspread like it was burning through the fabric.

“Then who—” I started.

Ramos cut in, low. “Stay where you are. I’m on my way.”

I sat on the edge of the hotel bed, phone in my hand, staring at the card until my eyes burned.

Somewhere out in the hallway, nothing moved. No humming. No footsteps.

Just silence.

And the certainty that whatever had been waiting for me at Horizon Arms didn’t stop with one man in a pig mask.",0,1771173193.0,TheDarkArchive,0,0.5,False
1r5izz1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlAnon/comments/1r5izz1/am_i_just_in_denial/,Am I just in denial?,"I really need help and I don't know who to talk to. My husband of more than 20 years has been struggling more and more with drinking. He's the most loving, kindest person, and my best friend...when he hasn't been drinking. 

Starting during the pandemic, like a lot of people, we started drinking more at home. I generally can't have now than 1 or 2 drinks without feeling nauseated, so I tend to moderate naturally. Maybe a few times a week I'll have a beer or a glass of wine. Still more than is healthy, I know. But my husband has gradually gotten more and more out of control. He basically never has just one or two drinks. He'll pour himself a20oz glass of wine and just keep refilling it. It's worse after I go to bed. I'll get up the next morning and see that he finished 2 bottles of wine, or half a liter of vodka. I frequently find him when I wake up in the morning, passed out at his desk from gaming the night before. 

There have been several incidents that have really scared me. Once we were at a restaurant and I left to take our dog for a walk around the campsite while he paid the bill. After 30 minutes he didn't come back, so I went to find him-passed out, head down on the table. Recently on a trip to visit friends, he was so drunk he got up, walked into the adjoining office, sat on a coffee table and relieved himself while I yelled at him that he wasn't in the bathroom. Then he slipped in it and injured his wrist quite badly. 

I think I've been in denial for a while, but recently he's been waking up still sounding drunk, and has been missing meetings or needing to call in sick (we both work from home) because he's not fit in the morning. 

I'm struggling with how to address this and if I'm overreacting. I still drink occasionally, and I'm sure that doesn't help. I'm embarrassed to talk to friends or family, but I spend so much time now counting bottles in the morning, trying to make sure he is awake for work, and then worrying or being angry.

After taking the bus,  smashing my face on a metal bar, sitting on a 2-3 hours each way to work, etc....I found out there's a program that helps!

No idea if you have this in your state or county, but here in WA/King county (I'm pretty sure it spans at least the bordering counties, not sure if it's the same though) there's a program called access.

This is the best thing ever created!!  For $1.75, as opposed to the $1 I pay for the bus, they will send a little bus or car to take me.....anywhere!  Work, shopping, to a friend's house... and have a companion go with you, as well!  You have to book the ride the day before because they will group you with people going your way and may take as long as the regular bus, but not standing in the 30 degree misty rain here for 28 minutes because you missed the bus by 2 minutes... they pick you up and drop you off at the door!

Yes, I know that I'm luckier somehow, but hey my 40 years of taxes, I'm cool with using the system for me!  😀

So.... if you're near me, see if they have this!!  Your metro area will know.   If you're not here, look to see if maybe they have a program like this!!  After 2 years, I stumbled onto it somehow (most likely a sign on the regular bus)...there may be one near you!!  Or, you can move up here to king county and we can have coffee!!  ☕️  🚬 😀",4,1771173101.0,Epilepsy_Universe,3,1.0,False

Three days after Horizon Arms, my leg still felt like it didn’t belong to me.

Not in the dramatic way—no phantom limb stuff. Just the plain, annoying reality of healing: tight skin, deep bruising, the staples pulling when I stood too fast, that hot sting when blood started moving through it again after I’d been sitting. The doctor had warned me about infection like he’d seen a hundred guys shrug it off and come back worse. I didn’t shrug it off. I kept it clean. I kept it wrapped. I took the antibiotics on schedule. I did everything you’re supposed to do when you’ve learned the hard way that a hallway can have teeth.

I also did what you’re not supposed to do.

I replayed it until the memory felt worn down at the edges.

The delivery. The pig squeal. The mask. The humming that stayed calm while I was bleeding out. The sign. The preview notification that didn’t “exist” anywhere on my phone once I tapped it.

Detective Ramos had been straight with me. She told me not to go back. She told me to stop taking anonymous jobs. She told me to call if anything changed.

She also told me something I didn’t like hearing because it sounded too close to a warning you give someone right before you lose them.

“He leaves contact,” she said. “He doesn’t like being forgotten.”

“Who is he?” I asked.

“A suspect,” she said. “A pattern. Not a name I can put in your hands yet.”

“What does that mean?” I asked.

“It means we’ve had bodies that match the theme,” she said. “We’ve had survivors who didn’t want to testify, people who disappeared before we could talk to them, and a building full of blind spots the city refuses to take responsibility for. It means we’ve been chasing smoke.”

I went back to my first-floor apartment anyway, because my life isn’t the kind of life where you can just “stay somewhere else” without it becoming a problem you can’t pay for.

Normal didn’t want me.

On the second day, I found the first card taped to my bedroom window.

It was a cheap Valentine’s card. The kind you buy in a pack of thirty-two for kids to hand out in elementary school. Bright red. Cartoon hearts. A stupid little pun on the front.

I didn’t read it at first. I just stared at it through the glass from inside, like it might move.

The tape was clear packing tape, pressed down hard. Whoever put it there had smoothed it flat with their palm.

My window faces the parking lot. There’s a streetlight out there that makes everything look slightly yellow after dark. I could see my own reflection over the card. My face looked tired. My eyes looked wrong.

I peeled the card off with my fingertips.

My hands shook. It made me angry, because I kept telling myself I wasn’t “that guy,” the one who gets spooked by paper. But my body didn’t care about my opinions. My body remembered the hall. It remembered blood on concrete. It remembered the way the humming stopped when I made progress.

Inside the card, in thick black marker:

MY VALENTINE

No signature. No joke. No smiley face.

I called Ramos.

Her tone didn’t change when I told her. That was the first thing that told me she’d seen this before.

“Don’t touch it with bare hands,” she said.

“I already did,” I told her.

“Wash your hands. Soap and hot water,” she said. “Then put the card in a bag or envelope. Don’t lick anything. Don’t throw it out.”

“Why?” I asked.

There was a pause, like she was weighing how much to tell me over the phone.

“We’ve had a couple incidents where people touched something and got… sleepy,” she said, choosing her words carefully. “Could be coincidence. Could be cheap chemicals. Could be nothing. But I don’t gamble with ‘could.’”

Sleepy.

I stared at my hand. It looked normal. It didn’t feel normal. My skin felt like it was buzzing.

An officer came later. He took the card like it was evidence, because it was. He asked if I had enemies. I told him I wasn’t important enough to have enemies.

That night, I slept with my phone plugged in, my lights on, and a kitchen chair wedged under my doorknob like I was a kid home alone and my fear had a furniture budget.

The next morning, there was another card.

Not on my window.

Under my front door.

It had been slid in carefully, not bent, not torn. Like whoever did it wanted me to see it intact.

This one wasn’t a kid’s card. It was thicker paper, glossy. On the front: two pigs in little outfits holding hands inside a heart frame.

My stomach rolled.

Inside, same black marker:

SOON

No one in my building had seen a thing.

That’s the part that made me feel stupid.

I asked my downstairs neighbor—Ms. Lowell—if she’d heard someone in the hallway overnight. She’s retired and wakes up at the slightest sound. She looks at people like she’s trying to decide what they’re made of.

“Honey,” she said, “I didn’t hear a thing.”

I asked the guy across from me, Trevor, if he’d been up late. Trevor always smells faintly like vape juice and microwaved food.

“I got work at six,” he said. “I’m asleep by ten, man. Why?”

I told him someone had been messing with my door. He blinked like he didn’t want to be involved in anything that might require him to speak to police.

“Maybe it’s kids,” he said, and then immediately looked relieved that he’d found an explanation that didn’t include effort.

Kids don’t tape cards to a window at chest height and smooth the tape like they’re sealing a package.

Ramos increased patrols. That’s what she told me. A couple units did passes. One parked down the block for a while. She told me to keep my curtains closed. She told me to stop answering unknown numbers. She told me to put a camera inside my apartment if I could.

I did the cheap version of that: I set my phone up on a bookshelf one night with the camera pointed at the door, plugged in so it wouldn’t die, screen dimmed, hoping it would catch something.

At 2:13 a.m., the phone stopped recording.

No crash message. No low storage warning. It just ended like someone had hit stop.

When I tried to play it back, the last thing it showed was the hallway under my door—silent—and then a blur, like my phone had been bumped. After that, nothing. A black screen and the timestamp still counting up, like it was recording darkness.

Ramos wasn’t impressed. Not because she didn’t believe me—because it fit.

“Half the people we’ve talked to say electronics do weird things around it,” she said. “Some of them are lying. Some of them are scared. Some of them… aren’t wrong.”

On day four, I found a card taped to the outside of my kitchen window.

Not the bedroom this time. A different angle. Like someone wanted me to know they could reach any side of me they wanted.

That night, I left my TV on low. I didn’t even watch it. I just needed noise that wasn’t my thoughts.

I fell asleep on my couch around midnight with a blanket half over my legs, my phone on my chest, and my crutch leaning against the coffee table. I remember thinking, right before I drifted off, that my apartment felt too quiet for a building full of people.

I woke up because my mouth tasted like pennies.

It took me a second to realize I was awake. Like I’d been pulled out of sleep too quickly and my brain hadn’t caught up. My tongue felt thick. My limbs felt heavy, the way they do after cold medicine or a couple beers when you shouldn’t have either.

The first thing I noticed was the air.

Not my apartment air.

My place smells like detergent and old carpet and the faint burnt smell from my toaster oven because I always set it too hot. This air smelled like stale carpet and cold concrete and that faint sweet edge underneath.

The same sweet edge from Horizon Arms.

I sat up too fast and my leg screamed. My body tried to follow it with panic and I had to clamp down hard just to keep from yelling.

It was dark, but not fully dark. There was a weak red glow somewhere, and after my eyes adjusted I saw what it was: an EXIT sign at the end of a hallway.

A hallway.

Not my living room.

Not my kitchen.

A hallway with dirty runner carpet and doors on either side.

I was lying on my back on that carpet like someone had dropped me there.

My heart started hammering, and I had that split-second hope that this was a nightmare. That I’d fallen asleep watching TV and my brain was doing the thing brains do when they’re scared.

Then I smelled it again. The metal note. The old air freshener note. The memory locked into the scent. My stomach went cold.

Horizon Arms.

I pushed up onto my elbows. My hands shook so badly my palms slid on the carpet fibers. My mouth was dry. My throat felt raw.

I tried to stand and almost fell. My left leg didn’t want to take weight. The staples were gone now, but the wound was still healing and the muscle didn’t trust anything. Someone had moved me. Someone had carried me. My leg had been handled like luggage.

I looked down at myself.

Same shirt I’d fallen asleep in. Same jeans. No shoes. My socks were dirty now. My phone was gone. My wallet was gone. No crutch.

My mind went straight to the cards. The tape. The “sleepy” comment.

I remembered peeling the first card off my window with bare hands and thinking it was just paper.

I swallowed hard, forcing my breathing to slow.

Panic gets you killed fast. That’s not a motivational quote. It’s just true. If I started running blind, I’d fall. If I fell, I’d bleed. If I bled, I’d be stuck.

I listened.

No voices. No footsteps. No radio. No sirens. Just the building settling, faint, and my own breathing too loud.

I pushed myself up and leaned against the wall.

The hallway looked like the twelfth floor.

Same weak red EXIT sign. Same doors. Same carpet. Same lack of daylight. But it was hard to be sure. Buildings repeat themselves. That’s how they’re built.

I limped to the nearest door and tried the handle.

Locked.

The next one.

Locked.

The third.

It opened.

The door swung inward with a soft scrape, and a smell rolled out—old apartment smell, stale water, mildew, something dead a long time ago. The room was dark. I felt along the wall until my hand hit a light switch.

Nothing happened.

Of course it didn’t.

I stepped inside anyway.

The floor was uneven with debris. I moved slow, feeling with my feet. My eyes adjusted enough to make out shapes: a kitchen counter, a sink filled with something black and dried, cabinets hanging open. A living room with an empty space where a couch might’ve been, and a stain on the wall like something had burned there.

I wasn’t searching for comfort. I was searching for something sharp.

A weapon.

I found a bathroom. The mirror above the sink was cracked, a spiderweb of fractures. The lower corner had already been smashed out. Shards lay on the counter.

I crouched and picked up the biggest piece I could find.

Jagged edge. Sharp enough to cut.

I set it down, grabbed the hem of my shirt, and ripped.

The fabric tore with a sound that was too loud in the quiet.

I wrapped the cloth around the base of the shard, twisting it tight to make a grip. It wasn’t pretty. It wasn’t stable. But it gave me something to hold that wouldn’t slice my palm open the first time I moved.

A makeshift knife.

My hands were shaking so badly I had to take a second just to squeeze and make sure I could still grip it.

I limped out and pulled the apartment door almost shut behind me, leaving it cracked. Not because I thought it would hide me. Because a fully open door is a signal. A crack could at least make someone hesitate.

My heart thumped in my throat.

I didn’t know where I was. I didn’t know how far the stairwell was. I didn’t know if the hallway was a dead end on one side and a trap on the other.

Then I heard it.

Humming.

Soft at first, so faint I thought it might be the building settling in some weird way.

Then clearer, closer.

A steady tune, calm, like someone with time.

I backed into the shadow of the cracked door, pressing myself against the wall inside the apartment. I held the mirror shard close to my chest, trying not to breathe loud.

Footsteps, soft on the carpet, not rushed.

I peeked through the crack.

At first I saw nothing. Just darkness and the weak red glow.

Then he came into view.

Tall. Thin. Hoodie. Jeans. Boots.

Pig mask.

The same pinkish rubber, the same snout, the same glossy black eye holes.

He walked like he wasn’t afraid of anything in that building. Like he owned the air.

The humming didn’t break rhythm.

He passed my door without looking at it, and for one stupid second my brain tried to grab hope from that. Like maybe he didn’t know where I was.

Then he stopped.

Right outside the door.

The humming continued, lower now, like he was humming to himself more than into the air.

He tilted his head.

Slowly, like he could hear my heartbeat through the wall.

I gripped the shard so hard the cloth creaked.

If he opened the door, I’d have no room to react. I’d be trapped between the bathroom and the kitchen with no exit.

My brain went cold and clear in a way it hadn’t since the first time I saw him.

Ambush.

Not because I was brave. Because I didn’t have other options.

I stepped toward the doorway, putting my shoulder near the frame. I set my feet as best I could with my leg. I kept my body pressed tight to the wall so I’d be out of sight until the last second.

The humming stopped.

Silence hit hard.

Then the door began to open.

Slowly.

The crack widened by inches. Light didn’t spill in because there was no real light, just the faint red smear from the EXIT sign.

The pig mask appeared in the gap.

The snout. The empty eye holes.

He didn’t push the door all the way at first. He paused with it half open, like he was letting me decide.

I moved.

I lunged out of the shadow and drove the mirror shard forward with both hands.

The shard hit something soft.

The mask.

It didn’t stab through like flesh. It scraped hard across rubber and caught at the edge of an eye hole. I felt it snag. I jerked, trying to drive it deeper.

He reacted fast.

His hand shot up and grabbed my wrist. His grip was strong, shockingly strong for someone who looked thin. The cold panic hit again—this wasn’t a normal guy in a mask doing a prank.

I twisted, trying to wrench free, and the mirror shard slipped, slicing along the edge where the mask met skin.

For a split second, I saw real skin under the rubber. Pale. Human.

He made a sound.

Not words. Not a scream.

A quick wet inhale, like surprise.

Then he slammed the door into me.

The edge hit my shoulder and bounced me back into the apartment. Pain sparked down my arm. I stumbled, my bad leg buckling, and I caught myself on the counter with my free hand.

He stepped in.

The humming started again immediately, like he couldn’t help it.

I swung the shard again, aiming lower, toward his throat.

He leaned back just enough to let it pass, then grabbed my forearm and twisted.

White pain shot through my elbow. The shard nearly dropped. I held on by reflex.

He shoved me hard, and I hit the wall. Dust shook loose from the paint and drifted into my face. I coughed and my eyes watered.

I didn’t stop moving.

I went for him again, slashing now instead of stabbing. The shard caught his hoodie and tore fabric. I felt it scrape something underneath.

He didn’t bleed much. Or maybe I just couldn’t see it in the dark.

He reached into his hoodie pocket.

My stomach flipped.

I swung again, and he blocked it with his forearm like he didn’t care if he got cut. The shard bit into fabric and maybe skin.

Then he pulled his hand out.

A knife.

Not a kitchen knife. Not a pocketknife.

A thin blade, longer than my hand, with a dark handle. Made for stabbing.

He held it low, relaxed.

The humming continued.

I backed up, chest heaving.

“I don’t want this,” I said. My voice sounded weak even to me. “I delivered the package. I did what you wanted.”

He tilted his head again.

Then he stepped forward.

I rushed him, because if he got to choose the distance, I was dead. I threw my weight into it, bad leg and all, and slammed into him shoulder-first.

He stumbled back a step.

I drove the shard up toward his neck again.

This time it landed. Not deep, but enough that I felt it slide under the edge of the mask and scrape skin.

He jerked away with a sharp movement, and for a second the mask shifted.

I saw part of his mouth.

Lips pulled tight, not in fear, but in concentration.

He didn’t make a sound.

He just thrust the knife toward me.

I twisted aside and felt the blade catch my shirt, then slip past. If I’d been a half-second slower, it would’ve been my ribs.

We fought like two animals in a small space. No choreography. No clean moves. Just grabbing and shoving and trying to keep the sharp thing pointed away from your important parts.

My leg gave out again and I went down to one knee.

He took advantage instantly.

He kicked my bad leg.

Pain hit so hot I saw stars. I cried out, and the sound echoed off the bare walls.

He stepped in to finish it.

I threw the shard upward blindly.

It hit his mask again, and this time it dug into the rubber near the snout. The shard snapped a piece off. The pig mask cracked.

He jerked back, and the knife hand dipped low.

I grabbed his wrist.

My fingers locked around it, both hands, and I squeezed like my life depended on it.

He tried to wrench free, but I held.

The humming stopped—finally—like it took too much focus to keep it going.

His knife hand trembled. The blade hovered inches from my stomach.

I shoved up with my shoulder and drove him back.

We crashed into something—maybe a table frame, maybe a broken chair—and it snapped under our weight.

I got to my feet, barely.

We were near a window now. I hadn’t even noticed it in the dark. The glass was dirty but intact, and beyond it was night sky and the faint orange glow of streetlights far below.

Twelfth floor.

I knew it in my bones.

He lunged again, and this time I didn’t dodge.

I grabbed him and drove him toward the window with everything I had.

He slashed at me. The blade skimmed my side. Heat, then wetness. Not deep enough to drop me, but enough to remind me what losing feels like.

I shoved again.

He slammed into the window. The glass held.

He raised the knife overhand.

I saw the angle. I saw the intent.

I swung the mirror shard into his wrist.

The glass cut.

He flinched, knife dipping.

I didn’t hesitate. I drove my shoulder into his chest and shoved again.

The window cracked.

A spiderweb raced across it.

Air hissed through the fractures.

He tried to brace, boots scraping on the floor, but there was nothing solid.

I shoved again.

The window gave.

The glass burst outward with a sharp, explosive sound, and cold air slapped my face.

For a split-second, his knife came up.

I felt it.

A hard punch between my shoulder blades.

Not pain at first—just pressure.

Then fire.

He had stabbed me in the back.

The world went tight and bright and narrow.

My hands slipped.

But my momentum was already moving forward, and his balance was already broken.

He went through the shattered window.

For a second, his hands grabbed at the frame. The pig mask looked straight at me, empty-eyed, and I could see his fingers clenched around jagged glass.

Then he slipped.

He fell.

No scream. No flailing.

Just a drop into darkness.

I stumbled back from the window, choking on my own breath. My back screamed. Warmth spread under my shirt. My hands shook so hard I couldn’t make them do anything useful.

I staggered toward the hallway door.

My vision tunneled.

I made it out into the hall and collapsed against the wall, sliding down until I hit the carpet.

I forced myself to move. Forced myself to get my knees under me. Forced myself to crawl, because standing wasn’t happening.

The stairwell was down the hall.

I could see the red EXIT sign like a distant ember.

The building was silent again.

No humming.

No footsteps.

Just my breathing and the wet sound of blood.

I crawled until my arms burned.

When I reached the stairwell door, I shoved it with my shoulder.

It opened.

Thank God.

I tumbled inside and dragged it shut behind me. I didn’t lock it. My hands wouldn’t cooperate. I just leaned against it like my body could be a deadbolt.

I didn’t have my phone.

That hit me like another stab. No phone. No way to call 911. No way to call anyone.

My mind grabbed for options. Screaming. Yelling down the stairwell. Trying to get outside.

I opened my mouth to shout and nothing came out but a dry rasp.

Then I heard something below.

Footsteps. Multiple. Fast.

Voices.

“—this way!”

Flashlights cut up the stairwell, white beams bouncing off the walls.

Police.

Real police.

They came up the stairs fast, two at first, then more behind them. Guns drawn, lights moving. Their faces were tight with urgency like they’d been running toward this, not stumbling into it.

One of them saw me slumped against the door and swore.

“Sir! Hands where I can see them!”

I lifted my hands slowly. My palms were smeared with blood and dust.

“I’m hurt,” I managed.

“We got you,” another voice said. “EMS is right behind us.”

An officer crouched near me, keeping his gun angled away but still ready.

“What happened?” he asked.

“Pig mask,” I said. “He stabbed me. I pushed him out the window.”

The officer’s eyes flicked to his partner.

His partner keyed his radio. “Suspect may be down. Twelfth floor. Window breach. Victim injured, stab wound back.”

I expected disbelief.

Instead, the crouched officer muttered, “About time.”

The paramedics reached me and started working, pulling my shirt up, pressing gauze into the wound, asking me questions I answered in half-sentences.

As they loaded me onto a stretcher, I saw more officers moving past, heading up toward the twelfth floor hallway with purpose, like they knew the layout already.

In the ambulance, the medic leaned close and said, “Stay with me. You’re losing blood but you’re alert. That’s good.”

At the hospital, everything became bright lights and clipped voices and the smell of disinfectant. They patched my back, stitched it, checked for organ damage. They told me I was lucky the blade had missed anything vital.

Lucky.

A word that feels stupid when you’ve been kidnapped and stabbed and you’re lying in a hospital gown with dried blood in your hair.

Ramos came in later.

She looked exhausted. Not the normal tired-cop look. The kind of tired you get when you’ve been chasing something for a long time and it finally trips.

“You’re alive,” she said.

“Barely,” I said.

She nodded, like she accepted that as fair.

“How did I get there?” I asked. “How did he—?”

Ramos sat down, and for the first time since I’d met her, she looked like she was choosing honesty over comfort.

“We pulled your building’s exterior footage again,” she said. “The one camera that still works pointed at the lot.”

My stomach tightened.

“At 1:47 a.m.,” she said, “a guy in a maintenance jacket walks in. Doesn’t look suspicious. Carries a tool bag. He goes to your hallway door like he’s done it before.”

“I didn’t let anyone in,” I said.

“You didn’t,” she said. “That door gets propped sometimes. People smoke. People take trash out. It’s one of those buildings.”

I clenched my jaw.

“He comes out five minutes later with you,” she said. “You’re barefoot. Head down. Looks like you’re half asleep. Like someone guided you without dragging you. That’s why nobody heard a fight.”

My throat went dry.

“You’re saying I walked,” I said.

“I’m saying you weren’t fighting,” she said. “We think you were sedated. We’re waiting on labs from the cards we recovered. Adhesives, ink, whatever he’s using.”

He didn’t carry me like luggage. He turned me into someone who followed.

Ramos continued, “We’ve had other cases with similar footage. Someone who looks like staff. Someone who belongs. That’s how he stayed active. Not by being a ghost. By blending.”

“Did you find him?” I asked. “Down there.”

Ramos’s eyes flicked to the side.

“They’re down there,” she said. “He fell like you said. He’s alive. And he’s in custody.”

“In custody,” I repeated, like my brain couldn’t grab it.

She nodded. “You helped catch him.”

Two uniformed officers came in later with Ramos. They looked at me like I was something between a victim and a witness and a guy they didn’t know how to talk to.

One of them said, “Sir… thank you.”

“For what?” I said, even though I knew.

“For helping us catch him,” he said. “He’s been active every Valentine’s. And the days after. He escalates until he gets what he wants.”

“What he wants,” I echoed.

“Victims,” the other officer said, flat. “He has a pattern. He leaves cards. He forces contact. He takes people to Horizon Arms. We’ve been trying to tie him to it for years.”

Ramos added quietly, “The problem wasn’t that we didn’t suspect. The problem was proof. No cameras inside Horizon Arms. Exterior cams dead half the time. Victims were transient or too scared to testify. And every time we got close, the guy we were watching would vanish into a building with ten exits and a service corridor nobody had on record.”

The uniformed officer said, “We called him the Valentine’s Day murderer in-house. Not official. Just… what he was.”

My skin crawled.

“You knew,” I said.

“We suspected,” Ramos corrected. “We didn’t have him.”

The uniformed officer added, “Some people call him the Piggy Man.”

That name sounded like a campfire dare. It didn’t match the knife in my back.

“We have him now,” Ramos said. “Because you fought back.”

I got released two days later with more stitches and more meds and a discharge packet thick enough to make me want to throw up. Ramos had pulled strings to get me a short-term hotel room under a victim’s assistance program. It wasn’t fancy, but it had locks that worked and people at a front desk who would look up if someone walked in at 3 a.m.

Nolan met me there and sat on the edge of the bed and didn’t talk for a while, because sometimes your friend doesn’t need to fill the silence. Sometimes they just need to be there so you don’t feel like you’re the only human on earth.

“They caught him,” Nolan said finally.

“Yeah,” I said.

“You okay?” he asked.

I laughed once, sharp and humorless. “No,” I said. “But I’m alive.”

For a day, I almost believed it could end there.

They caught him. They had him. The Piggy Man. The Valentine’s Day murderer.

I watched the local news clip on my phone, volume low. They didn’t show his face. They showed the building. They showed police tape. They showed a stretcher being loaded into a van. They said “suspect in custody” and “long-running investigation” and “community relieved.”

Ramos called and said, “He’s talking.”

“About what?” I asked.

“About you,” she said.

My stomach tightened.

“Why?” I asked.

“We don’t know yet,” she said. “But he’s fixated. You need to move.”

I’d already decided that.

The next day I made calls. Looked at listings. Asked Nolan if I could store some stuff at his place. Called my landlord and told him I was breaking the lease and let him yell because yelling meant he was human and predictable and not humming behind a mask.

I went back to my apartment once, in daylight, with Nolan and two officers.

I didn’t want to. But I needed clothes. I needed my laptop. I needed my life in boxes.

The hallway looked the same as it always had. Beige paint. Cheap carpet. Somebody’s cooking smell drifting under a door.

Normal.

We packed fast. Nolan carried most of it because my leg and back were still wrecked. The officers stood in the hall and watched like statues. Ms. Lowell came out once and looked at me with worry and curiosity.

“You be safe,” she said.

“I’m trying,” I told her.

As we left, one of the officers said, “You got any more cards?”

“Not today,” I said.

He nodded, like “today” was the only word that mattered.

I didn’t sleep in that apartment again.

Two nights later, I was in the hotel. I’d finally managed to eat something besides vending machine crackers. I’d finally managed to sit still without flinching at every hallway sound.

I was on my back staring at the ceiling when I heard a faint sound outside my door.

Paper scraping.

Not a knock. Not a footstep.

Just the soft, deliberate sound of something being pushed along carpet.

My whole body went cold.

I didn’t move. I didn’t breathe.

The sound stopped.

Then there was a whisper of paper sliding.

Under the door.

I sat up too fast and pain shot through my back, but fear covered it like a blanket.

I stared at the thin gap under the door.

A corner of white cardstock protruded.

I didn’t touch it with my hands. I grabbed a hotel pen off the nightstand and used it to hook the paper and pull it fully into the room.

It was a Valentine’s card.

Thick paper. Plain front. No cartoon pigs. No glitter.

I opened it with the pen and my thumb, careful like I was disarming something.

Inside, in black marker, the letters clean and steady:

I’LL BE SEEING YOU SOON MY VALENTINE

And at the bottom:

XO

My throat tightened. My ears rang.

I grabbed my phone and called Ramos with hands that shook so badly I nearly dropped it.

She answered on the second ring. “Yeah?”

“It’s here,” I said.

“What’s where?” she asked, already sharper.

“A card,” I said. “Under my hotel door.”

Silence for half a second. Then, “Don’t touch it. Don’t leave the room. Lock the deadbolt. I’m calling it in.”

“I thought you had him,” I said, and my voice cracked.

“We do,” she said, and her voice went flat in a way that made my stomach drop further. “We have the man we arrested.”

I stared at the card on the bedspread like it was burning through the fabric.

“Then who—” I started.

Ramos cut in, low. “Stay where you are. I’m on my way.”

I sat on the edge of the hotel bed, phone in my hand, staring at the card until my eyes burned.

Somewhere out in the hallway, nothing moved. No humming. No footsteps.

Just silence.

And the certainty that whatever had been waiting for me at Horizon Arms didn’t stop with one man in a pig mask.",2,1771173023.0,horrorstories,4,1.0,False

I used to think adult coloring books were a myth — something made for “Pinterest people” with perfect handwriting and a spotless coffee table.  

Then stress hit a little too close to home.  
Emails nonstop. Coffee didn’t help. Sleep? Optional.  

One night, while scrolling mindlessly, I downloaded an **adult coloring book PDF** just out of curiosity. No expectations. Just a quiet corner, some colored pencils, and an open mind.  

And wow — ten minutes later, my breathing slowed down.  
I wasn’t thinking about deadlines. Or dishes.  
Just color, shape, shade, repeat.  

That’s when it clicked: adults need play, too.  
We outgrow recess but never outgrow the need for calm.  

These days, I color the way other people meditate. It’s like yoga for a restless mind — without having to roll out a single mat.

Three days after Horizon Arms, my leg still felt like it didn’t belong to me.

Not in the dramatic way—no phantom limb stuff. Just the plain, annoying reality of healing: tight skin, deep bruising, the staples pulling when I stood too fast, that hot sting when blood started moving through it again after I’d been sitting. The doctor had warned me about infection like he’d seen a hundred guys shrug it off and come back worse. I didn’t shrug it off. I kept it clean. I kept it wrapped. I took the antibiotics on schedule. I did everything you’re supposed to do when you’ve learned the hard way that a hallway can have teeth.

I also did what you’re not supposed to do.

I replayed it until the memory felt worn down at the edges.

The delivery. The pig squeal. The mask. The humming that stayed calm while I was bleeding out. The sign. The preview notification that didn’t “exist” anywhere on my phone once I tapped it.

Detective Ramos had been straight with me. She told me not to go back. She told me to stop taking anonymous jobs. She told me to call if anything changed.

She also told me something I didn’t like hearing because it sounded too close to a warning you give someone right before you lose them.

“He leaves contact,” she said. “He doesn’t like being forgotten.”

“Who is he?” I asked.

“A suspect,” she said. “A pattern. Not a name I can put in your hands yet.”

“What does that mean?” I asked.

“It means we’ve had bodies that match the theme,” she said. “We’ve had survivors who didn’t want to testify, people who disappeared before we could talk to them, and a building full of blind spots the city refuses to take responsibility for. It means we’ve been chasing smoke.”

I went back to my first-floor apartment anyway, because my life isn’t the kind of life where you can just “stay somewhere else” without it becoming a problem you can’t pay for.

Normal didn’t want me.

On the second day, I found the first card taped to my bedroom window.

It was a cheap Valentine’s card. The kind you buy in a pack of thirty-two for kids to hand out in elementary school. Bright red. Cartoon hearts. A stupid little pun on the front.

I didn’t read it at first. I just stared at it through the glass from inside, like it might move.

The tape was clear packing tape, pressed down hard. Whoever put it there had smoothed it flat with their palm.

My window faces the parking lot. There’s a streetlight out there that makes everything look slightly yellow after dark. I could see my own reflection over the card. My face looked tired. My eyes looked wrong.

I peeled the card off with my fingertips.

My hands shook. It made me angry, because I kept telling myself I wasn’t “that guy,” the one who gets spooked by paper. But my body didn’t care about my opinions. My body remembered the hall. It remembered blood on concrete. It remembered the way the humming stopped when I made progress.

Inside the card, in thick black marker:

MY VALENTINE

No signature. No joke. No smiley face.

I called Ramos.

Her tone didn’t change when I told her. That was the first thing that told me she’d seen this before.

“Don’t touch it with bare hands,” she said.

“I already did,” I told her.

“Wash your hands. Soap and hot water,” she said. “Then put the card in a bag or envelope. Don’t lick anything. Don’t throw it out.”

“Why?” I asked.

There was a pause, like she was weighing how much to tell me over the phone.

“We’ve had a couple incidents where people touched something and got… sleepy,” she said, choosing her words carefully. “Could be coincidence. Could be cheap chemicals. Could be nothing. But I don’t gamble with ‘could.’”

Sleepy.

I stared at my hand. It looked normal. It didn’t feel normal. My skin felt like it was buzzing.

An officer came later. He took the card like it was evidence, because it was. He asked if I had enemies. I told him I wasn’t important enough to have enemies.

That night, I slept with my phone plugged in, my lights on, and a kitchen chair wedged under my doorknob like I was a kid home alone and my fear had a furniture budget.

The next morning, there was another card.

Not on my window.

Under my front door.

It had been slid in carefully, not bent, not torn. Like whoever did it wanted me to see it intact.

This one wasn’t a kid’s card. It was thicker paper, glossy. On the front: two pigs in little outfits holding hands inside a heart frame.

My stomach rolled.

Inside, same black marker:

SOON

No one in my building had seen a thing.

That’s the part that made me feel stupid.

I asked my downstairs neighbor—Ms. Lowell—if she’d heard someone in the hallway overnight. She’s retired and wakes up at the slightest sound. She looks at people like she’s trying to decide what they’re made of.

“Honey,” she said, “I didn’t hear a thing.”

I asked the guy across from me, Trevor, if he’d been up late. Trevor always smells faintly like vape juice and microwaved food.

“I got work at six,” he said. “I’m asleep by ten, man. Why?”

I told him someone had been messing with my door. He blinked like he didn’t want to be involved in anything that might require him to speak to police.

“Maybe it’s kids,” he said, and then immediately looked relieved that he’d found an explanation that didn’t include effort.

Kids don’t tape cards to a window at chest height and smooth the tape like they’re sealing a package.

Ramos increased patrols. That’s what she told me. A couple units did passes. One parked down the block for a while. She told me to keep my curtains closed. She told me to stop answering unknown numbers. She told me to put a camera inside my apartment if I could.

I did the cheap version of that: I set my phone up on a bookshelf one night with the camera pointed at the door, plugged in so it wouldn’t die, screen dimmed, hoping it would catch something.

At 2:13 a.m., the phone stopped recording.

No crash message. No low storage warning. It just ended like someone had hit stop.

When I tried to play it back, the last thing it showed was the hallway under my door—silent—and then a blur, like my phone had been bumped. After that, nothing. A black screen and the timestamp still counting up, like it was recording darkness.

Ramos wasn’t impressed. Not because she didn’t believe me—because it fit.

“Half the people we’ve talked to say electronics do weird things around it,” she said. “Some of them are lying. Some of them are scared. Some of them… aren’t wrong.”

On day four, I found a card taped to the outside of my kitchen window.

Not the bedroom this time. A different angle. Like someone wanted me to know they could reach any side of me they wanted.

That night, I left my TV on low. I didn’t even watch it. I just needed noise that wasn’t my thoughts.

I fell asleep on my couch around midnight with a blanket half over my legs, my phone on my chest, and my crutch leaning against the coffee table. I remember thinking, right before I drifted off, that my apartment felt too quiet for a building full of people.

I woke up because my mouth tasted like pennies.

It took me a second to realize I was awake. Like I’d been pulled out of sleep too quickly and my brain hadn’t caught up. My tongue felt thick. My limbs felt heavy, the way they do after cold medicine or a couple beers when you shouldn’t have either.

The first thing I noticed was the air.

Not my apartment air.

My place smells like detergent and old carpet and the faint burnt smell from my toaster oven because I always set it too hot. This air smelled like stale carpet and cold concrete and that faint sweet edge underneath.

The same sweet edge from Horizon Arms.

I sat up too fast and my leg screamed. My body tried to follow it with panic and I had to clamp down hard just to keep from yelling.

It was dark, but not fully dark. There was a weak red glow somewhere, and after my eyes adjusted I saw what it was: an EXIT sign at the end of a hallway.

A hallway.

Not my living room.

Not my kitchen.

A hallway with dirty runner carpet and doors on either side.

I was lying on my back on that carpet like someone had dropped me there.

My heart started hammering, and I had that split-second hope that this was a nightmare. That I’d fallen asleep watching TV and my brain was doing the thing brains do when they’re scared.

Then I smelled it again. The metal note. The old air freshener note. The memory locked into the scent. My stomach went cold.

Horizon Arms.

I pushed up onto my elbows. My hands shook so badly my palms slid on the carpet fibers. My mouth was dry. My throat felt raw.

I tried to stand and almost fell. My left leg didn’t want to take weight. The staples were gone now, but the wound was still healing and the muscle didn’t trust anything. Someone had moved me. Someone had carried me. My leg had been handled like luggage.

I looked down at myself.

Same shirt I’d fallen asleep in. Same jeans. No shoes. My socks were dirty now. My phone was gone. My wallet was gone. No crutch.

My mind went straight to the cards. The tape. The “sleepy” comment.

I remembered peeling the first card off my window with bare hands and thinking it was just paper.

I swallowed hard, forcing my breathing to slow.

Panic gets you killed fast. That’s not a motivational quote. It’s just true. If I started running blind, I’d fall. If I fell, I’d bleed. If I bled, I’d be stuck.

I listened.

No voices. No footsteps. No radio. No sirens. Just the building settling, faint, and my own breathing too loud.

I pushed myself up and leaned against the wall.

The hallway looked like the twelfth floor.

Same weak red EXIT sign. Same doors. Same carpet. Same lack of daylight. But it was hard to be sure. Buildings repeat themselves. That’s how they’re built.

I limped to the nearest door and tried the handle.

Locked.

The next one.

Locked.

The third.

It opened.

The door swung inward with a soft scrape, and a smell rolled out—old apartment smell, stale water, mildew, something dead a long time ago. The room was dark. I felt along the wall until my hand hit a light switch.

Nothing happened.

Of course it didn’t.

I stepped inside anyway.

The floor was uneven with debris. I moved slow, feeling with my feet. My eyes adjusted enough to make out shapes: a kitchen counter, a sink filled with something black and dried, cabinets hanging open. A living room with an empty space where a couch might’ve been, and a stain on the wall like something had burned there.

I wasn’t searching for comfort. I was searching for something sharp.

A weapon.

I found a bathroom. The mirror above the sink was cracked, a spiderweb of fractures. The lower corner had already been smashed out. Shards lay on the counter.

I crouched and picked up the biggest piece I could find.

Jagged edge. Sharp enough to cut.

I set it down, grabbed the hem of my shirt, and ripped.

The fabric tore with a sound that was too loud in the quiet.

I wrapped the cloth around the base of the shard, twisting it tight to make a grip. It wasn’t pretty. It wasn’t stable. But it gave me something to hold that wouldn’t slice my palm open the first time I moved.

A makeshift knife.

My hands were shaking so badly I had to take a second just to squeeze and make sure I could still grip it.

I limped out and pulled the apartment door almost shut behind me, leaving it cracked. Not because I thought it would hide me. Because a fully open door is a signal. A crack could at least make someone hesitate.

My heart thumped in my throat.

I didn’t know where I was. I didn’t know how far the stairwell was. I didn’t know if the hallway was a dead end on one side and a trap on the other.

Then I heard it.

Humming.

Soft at first, so faint I thought it might be the building settling in some weird way.

Then clearer, closer.

A steady tune, calm, like someone with time.

I backed into the shadow of the cracked door, pressing myself against the wall inside the apartment. I held the mirror shard close to my chest, trying not to breathe loud.

Footsteps, soft on the carpet, not rushed.

I peeked through the crack.

At first I saw nothing. Just darkness and the weak red glow.

Then he came into view.

Tall. Thin. Hoodie. Jeans. Boots.

Pig mask.

The same pinkish rubber, the same snout, the same glossy black eye holes.

He walked like he wasn’t afraid of anything in that building. Like he owned the air.

The humming didn’t break rhythm.

He passed my door without looking at it, and for one stupid second my brain tried to grab hope from that. Like maybe he didn’t know where I was.

Then he stopped.

Right outside the door.

The humming continued, lower now, like he was humming to himself more than into the air.

He tilted his head.

Slowly, like he could hear my heartbeat through the wall.

I gripped the shard so hard the cloth creaked.

If he opened the door, I’d have no room to react. I’d be trapped between the bathroom and the kitchen with no exit.

My brain went cold and clear in a way it hadn’t since the first time I saw him.

Ambush.

Not because I was brave. Because I didn’t have other options.

I stepped toward the doorway, putting my shoulder near the frame. I set my feet as best I could with my leg. I kept my body pressed tight to the wall so I’d be out of sight until the last second.

The humming stopped.

Silence hit hard.

Then the door began to open.

Slowly.

The crack widened by inches. Light didn’t spill in because there was no real light, just the faint red smear from the EXIT sign.

The pig mask appeared in the gap.

The snout. The empty eye holes.

He didn’t push the door all the way at first. He paused with it half open, like he was letting me decide.

I moved.

I lunged out of the shadow and drove the mirror shard forward with both hands.

The shard hit something soft.

The mask.

It didn’t stab through like flesh. It scraped hard across rubber and caught at the edge of an eye hole. I felt it snag. I jerked, trying to drive it deeper.

He reacted fast.

His hand shot up and grabbed my wrist. His grip was strong, shockingly strong for someone who looked thin. The cold panic hit again—this wasn’t a normal guy in a mask doing a prank.

I twisted, trying to wrench free, and the mirror shard slipped, slicing along the edge where the mask met skin.

For a split second, I saw real skin under the rubber. Pale. Human.

He made a sound.

Not words. Not a scream.

A quick wet inhale, like surprise.

Then he slammed the door into me.

The edge hit my shoulder and bounced me back into the apartment. Pain sparked down my arm. I stumbled, my bad leg buckling, and I caught myself on the counter with my free hand.

He stepped in.

The humming started again immediately, like he couldn’t help it.

I swung the shard again, aiming lower, toward his throat.

He leaned back just enough to let it pass, then grabbed my forearm and twisted.

White pain shot through my elbow. The shard nearly dropped. I held on by reflex.

He shoved me hard, and I hit the wall. Dust shook loose from the paint and drifted into my face. I coughed and my eyes watered.

I didn’t stop moving.

I went for him again, slashing now instead of stabbing. The shard caught his hoodie and tore fabric. I felt it scrape something underneath.

He didn’t bleed much. Or maybe I just couldn’t see it in the dark.

He reached into his hoodie pocket.

My stomach flipped.

I swung again, and he blocked it with his forearm like he didn’t care if he got cut. The shard bit into fabric and maybe skin.

Then he pulled his hand out.

A knife.

Not a kitchen knife. Not a pocketknife.

A thin blade, longer than my hand, with a dark handle. Made for stabbing.

He held it low, relaxed.

The humming continued.

I backed up, chest heaving.

“I don’t want this,” I said. My voice sounded weak even to me. “I delivered the package. I did what you wanted.”

He tilted his head again.

Then he stepped forward.

I rushed him, because if he got to choose the distance, I was dead. I threw my weight into it, bad leg and all, and slammed into him shoulder-first.

He stumbled back a step.

I drove the shard up toward his neck again.

This time it landed. Not deep, but enough that I felt it slide under the edge of the mask and scrape skin.

He jerked away with a sharp movement, and for a second the mask shifted.

I saw part of his mouth.

Lips pulled tight, not in fear, but in concentration.

He didn’t make a sound.

He just thrust the knife toward me.

I twisted aside and felt the blade catch my shirt, then slip past. If I’d been a half-second slower, it would’ve been my ribs.

We fought like two animals in a small space. No choreography. No clean moves. Just grabbing and shoving and trying to keep the sharp thing pointed away from your important parts.

My leg gave out again and I went down to one knee.

He took advantage instantly.

He kicked my bad leg.

Pain hit so hot I saw stars. I cried out, and the sound echoed off the bare walls.

He stepped in to finish it.

I threw the shard upward blindly.

It hit his mask again, and this time it dug into the rubber near the snout. The shard snapped a piece off. The pig mask cracked.

He jerked back, and the knife hand dipped low.

I grabbed his wrist.

My fingers locked around it, both hands, and I squeezed like my life depended on it.

He tried to wrench free, but I held.

The humming stopped—finally—like it took too much focus to keep it going.

His knife hand trembled. The blade hovered inches from my stomach.

I shoved up with my shoulder and drove him back.

We crashed into something—maybe a table frame, maybe a broken chair—and it snapped under our weight.

I got to my feet, barely.

We were near a window now. I hadn’t even noticed it in the dark. The glass was dirty but intact, and beyond it was night sky and the faint orange glow of streetlights far below.

Twelfth floor.

I knew it in my bones.

He lunged again, and this time I didn’t dodge.

I grabbed him and drove him toward the window with everything I had.

He slashed at me. The blade skimmed my side. Heat, then wetness. Not deep enough to drop me, but enough to remind me what losing feels like.

I shoved again.

He slammed into the window. The glass held.

He raised the knife overhand.

I saw the angle. I saw the intent.

I swung the mirror shard into his wrist.

The glass cut.

He flinched, knife dipping.

I didn’t hesitate. I drove my shoulder into his chest and shoved again.

The window cracked.

A spiderweb raced across it.

Air hissed through the fractures.

He tried to brace, boots scraping on the floor, but there was nothing solid.

I shoved again.

The window gave.

The glass burst outward with a sharp, explosive sound, and cold air slapped my face.

For a split-second, his knife came up.

I felt it.

A hard punch between my shoulder blades.

Not pain at first—just pressure.

Then fire.

He had stabbed me in the back.

The world went tight and bright and narrow.

My hands slipped.

But my momentum was already moving forward, and his balance was already broken.

He went through the shattered window.

For a second, his hands grabbed at the frame. The pig mask looked straight at me, empty-eyed, and I could see his fingers clenched around jagged glass.

Then he slipped.

He fell.

No scream. No flailing.

Just a drop into darkness.

I stumbled back from the window, choking on my own breath. My back screamed. Warmth spread under my shirt. My hands shook so hard I couldn’t make them do anything useful.

I staggered toward the hallway door.

My vision tunneled.

I made it out into the hall and collapsed against the wall, sliding down until I hit the carpet.

I forced myself to move. Forced myself to get my knees under me. Forced myself to crawl, because standing wasn’t happening.

The stairwell was down the hall.

I could see the red EXIT sign like a distant ember.

The building was silent again.

No humming.

No footsteps.

Just my breathing and the wet sound of blood.

I crawled until my arms burned.

When I reached the stairwell door, I shoved it with my shoulder.

It opened.

Thank God.

I tumbled inside and dragged it shut behind me. I didn’t lock it. My hands wouldn’t cooperate. I just leaned against it like my body could be a deadbolt.

I didn’t have my phone.

That hit me like another stab. No phone. No way to call 911. No way to call anyone.

My mind grabbed for options. Screaming. Yelling down the stairwell. Trying to get outside.

I opened my mouth to shout and nothing came out but a dry rasp.

Then I heard something below.

Footsteps. Multiple. Fast.

Voices.

“—this way!”

Flashlights cut up the stairwell, white beams bouncing off the walls.

Police.

Real police.

They came up the stairs fast, two at first, then more behind them. Guns drawn, lights moving. Their faces were tight with urgency like they’d been running toward this, not stumbling into it.

One of them saw me slumped against the door and swore.

“Sir! Hands where I can see them!”

I lifted my hands slowly. My palms were smeared with blood and dust.

“I’m hurt,” I managed.

“We got you,” another voice said. “EMS is right behind us.”

An officer crouched near me, keeping his gun angled away but still ready.

“What happened?” he asked.

“Pig mask,” I said. “He stabbed me. I pushed him out the window.”

The officer’s eyes flicked to his partner.

His partner keyed his radio. “Suspect may be down. Twelfth floor. Window breach. Victim injured, stab wound back.”

I expected disbelief.

Instead, the crouched officer muttered, “About time.”

The paramedics reached me and started working, pulling my shirt up, pressing gauze into the wound, asking me questions I answered in half-sentences.

As they loaded me onto a stretcher, I saw more officers moving past, heading up toward the twelfth floor hallway with purpose, like they knew the layout already.

In the ambulance, the medic leaned close and said, “Stay with me. You’re losing blood but you’re alert. That’s good.”

At the hospital, everything became bright lights and clipped voices and the smell of disinfectant. They patched my back, stitched it, checked for organ damage. They told me I was lucky the blade had missed anything vital.

Lucky.

A word that feels stupid when you’ve been kidnapped and stabbed and you’re lying in a hospital gown with dried blood in your hair.

Ramos came in later.

She looked exhausted. Not the normal tired-cop look. The kind of tired you get when you’ve been chasing something for a long time and it finally trips.

“You’re alive,” she said.

“Barely,” I said.

She nodded, like she accepted that as fair.

“How did I get there?” I asked. “How did he—?”

Ramos sat down, and for the first time since I’d met her, she looked like she was choosing honesty over comfort.

“We pulled your building’s exterior footage again,” she said. “The one camera that still works pointed at the lot.”

My stomach tightened.

“At 1:47 a.m.,” she said, “a guy in a maintenance jacket walks in. Doesn’t look suspicious. Carries a tool bag. He goes to your hallway door like he’s done it before.”

“I didn’t let anyone in,” I said.

“You didn’t,” she said. “That door gets propped sometimes. People smoke. People take trash out. It’s one of those buildings.”

I clenched my jaw.

“He comes out five minutes later with you,” she said. “You’re barefoot. Head down. Looks like you’re half asleep. Like someone guided you without dragging you. That’s why nobody heard a fight.”

My throat went dry.

“You’re saying I walked,” I said.

“I’m saying you weren’t fighting,” she said. “We think you were sedated. We’re waiting on labs from the cards we recovered. Adhesives, ink, whatever he’s using.”

He didn’t carry me like luggage. He turned me into someone who followed.

Ramos continued, “We’ve had other cases with similar footage. Someone who looks like staff. Someone who belongs. That’s how he stayed active. Not by being a ghost. By blending.”

“Did you find him?” I asked. “Down there.”

Ramos’s eyes flicked to the side.

“They’re down there,” she said. “He fell like you said. He’s alive. And he’s in custody.”

“In custody,” I repeated, like my brain couldn’t grab it.

She nodded. “You helped catch him.”

Two uniformed officers came in later with Ramos. They looked at me like I was something between a victim and a witness and a guy they didn’t know how to talk to.

One of them said, “Sir… thank you.”

“For what?” I said, even though I knew.

“For helping us catch him,” he said. “He’s been active every Valentine’s. And the days after. He escalates until he gets what he wants.”

“What he wants,” I echoed.

“Victims,” the other officer said, flat. “He has a pattern. He leaves cards. He forces contact. He takes people to Horizon Arms. We’ve been trying to tie him to it for years.”

Ramos added quietly, “The problem wasn’t that we didn’t suspect. The problem was proof. No cameras inside Horizon Arms. Exterior cams dead half the time. Victims were transient or too scared to testify. And every time we got close, the guy we were watching would vanish into a building with ten exits and a service corridor nobody had on record.”

The uniformed officer said, “We called him the Valentine’s Day murderer in-house. Not official. Just… what he was.”

My skin crawled.

“You knew,” I said.

“We suspected,” Ramos corrected. “We didn’t have him.”

The uniformed officer added, “Some people call him the Piggy Man.”

That name sounded like a campfire dare. It didn’t match the knife in my back.

“We have him now,” Ramos said. “Because you fought back.”

I got released two days later with more stitches and more meds and a discharge packet thick enough to make me want to throw up. Ramos had pulled strings to get me a short-term hotel room under a victim’s assistance program. It wasn’t fancy, but it had locks that worked and people at a front desk who would look up if someone walked in at 3 a.m.

Nolan met me there and sat on the edge of the bed and didn’t talk for a while, because sometimes your friend doesn’t need to fill the silence. Sometimes they just need to be there so you don’t feel like you’re the only human on earth.

“They caught him,” Nolan said finally.

“Yeah,” I said.

“You okay?” he asked.

I laughed once, sharp and humorless. “No,” I said. “But I’m alive.”

For a day, I almost believed it could end there.

They caught him. They had him. The Piggy Man. The Valentine’s Day murderer.

I watched the local news clip on my phone, volume low. They didn’t show his face. They showed the building. They showed police tape. They showed a stretcher being loaded into a van. They said “suspect in custody” and “long-running investigation” and “community relieved.”

Ramos called and said, “He’s talking.”

“About what?” I asked.

“About you,” she said.

My stomach tightened.

“Why?” I asked.

“We don’t know yet,” she said. “But he’s fixated. You need to move.”

I’d already decided that.

The next day I made calls. Looked at listings. Asked Nolan if I could store some stuff at his place. Called my landlord and told him I was breaking the lease and let him yell because yelling meant he was human and predictable and not humming behind a mask.

I went back to my apartment once, in daylight, with Nolan and two officers.

I didn’t want to. But I needed clothes. I needed my laptop. I needed my life in boxes.

The hallway looked the same as it always had. Beige paint. Cheap carpet. Somebody’s cooking smell drifting under a door.

Normal.

We packed fast. Nolan carried most of it because my leg and back were still wrecked. The officers stood in the hall and watched like statues. Ms. Lowell came out once and looked at me with worry and curiosity.

“You be safe,” she said.

“I’m trying,” I told her.

As we left, one of the officers said, “You got any more cards?”

“Not today,” I said.

He nodded, like “today” was the only word that mattered.

I didn’t sleep in that apartment again.

Two nights later, I was in the hotel. I’d finally managed to eat something besides vending machine crackers. I’d finally managed to sit still without flinching at every hallway sound.

I was on my back staring at the ceiling when I heard a faint sound outside my door.

Paper scraping.

Not a knock. Not a footstep.

Just the soft, deliberate sound of something being pushed along carpet.

My whole body went cold.

I didn’t move. I didn’t breathe.

The sound stopped.

Then there was a whisper of paper sliding.

Under the door.

I sat up too fast and pain shot through my back, but fear covered it like a blanket.

I stared at the thin gap under the door.

A corner of white cardstock protruded.

I didn’t touch it with my hands. I grabbed a hotel pen off the nightstand and used it to hook the paper and pull it fully into the room.

It was a Valentine’s card.

Thick paper. Plain front. No cartoon pigs. No glitter.

I opened it with the pen and my thumb, careful like I was disarming something.

Inside, in black marker, the letters clean and steady:

I’LL BE SEEING YOU SOON MY VALENTINE

And at the bottom:

XO

My throat tightened. My ears rang.

I grabbed my phone and called Ramos with hands that shook so badly I nearly dropped it.

She answered on the second ring. “Yeah?”

“It’s here,” I said.

“What’s where?” she asked, already sharper.

“A card,” I said. “Under my hotel door.”

Silence for half a second. Then, “Don’t touch it. Don’t leave the room. Lock the deadbolt. I’m calling it in.”

“I thought you had him,” I said, and my voice cracked.

“We do,” she said, and her voice went flat in a way that made my stomach drop further. “We have the man we arrested.”

I stared at the card on the bedspread like it was burning through the fabric.

“Then who—” I started.

Ramos cut in, low. “Stay where you are. I’m on my way.”

I sat on the edge of the hotel bed, phone in my hand, staring at the card until my eyes burned.

Somewhere out in the hallway, nothing moved. No humming. No footsteps.

Just silence.

And the certainty that whatever had been waiting for me at Horizon Arms didn’t stop with one man in a pig mask.",13,1771172762.0,nosleep,5,0.81,False

It's a pink bouquet in a bag with strawberry KitKat.

First thing I really, really saw was that it was the wrong color. My friend loves green, bag, hoodies, jackets, water bottle, you name it. So I wondered why the flower wasn't green or any shade of green, it was literally all pink.

Second, strawberry??? She loves Matcha, almost all her drinks are Matcha, if not coffee.

Then, I kinda said something na ""Why isn't it green and the KitKats aren't Matcha?"". Said friend kind of smiled and the rest of our friends also pointed it out.

One of our friend's bf, side eyed me and said something like ""So, ano naman?"". I was like, hello? How can you court someone when you don't take their preferences for your gifts?

My friend kinda smoothed it out saying it's okay but I can see that she was also disappointed.

I gave all my classmates flowers with the ribbon being their favorite color so I don't understand why it is so hard? I'm not trying to be pakialamera but it's the little things you see that makes you question stuff talaga.",1,1771172738.0,FriendshipAdvice,3,1.0,False
1r5isxm,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGirlSurvivalGuide/comments/1r5isxm/recurring_uti/,recurring uti,"hi guys im 19f and for the past 7-8 months ive been experiencing recurrent utis, or to be specific one uti that won’t go away.

this all started after my boyfriend and i had sex and i was a bit silly and didn’t pee straight away, little did i know the consequences to those actions. the morning after i went to the toilet and my pee rlly smelt, felt like i was pissing out knifes and had a rlly bad tummy ache. i didn’t know what was up, no one had ever told me about utis and how horrible they are. researched a bit and came to the conclusion it was a uti, very mild tho so i tried to just take a bunch of urals for a week and see how that went (didn’t end well) i was in so much pain so i ended up going to the doctor, getting a urine test and being put on antibiotics. 

finished those, thought i was fine, get a check up urine test, still positive!!!!! this has happened every single time for the past 8 months. i’ve had every antibiotic for utis (doctor said i may be immune to them now) and ive been pretty sick from some of the antibiotics too (yeast infections, nausea, blood in urine) which on top on a uti is not fun. 

it’s horrible living in fear everytime i go to the toilet. 

some things i’ve been doing on and off my antibiotics to try and avoid or get rid of this uti (which is not working):

\- urinary tract probiotics 

\- drinking urals regularly 

\- wearing cotton underwear and pants 

\- lose fitting clothes 

\- wiping front to back

\- peeing when i need too

\- drinking at least 2-3 litres of water everyday 

\- had a ultrasound (kidney and bladder)

\- avoiding coffee (horrible)

\- avoiding alcohol 

\- avoiding smoking weed

\- avoiding sugary drinks even some juices

\- pelvic floor exercises everyday - i started this one a few weeks ago

\- trying to keep a lot of sugar out of my diet

\- worst of all avoiding sex - which is hard as i live with my boyfriend. he understands tho and throughout these 8 months i think in total we have had sex maybe 3-4 times, with protection, pee before and after and taken a ural after. 

but to continue, maybe about 5 months into this cycle. my symptoms were wayyy worse than normal. i couldnt even stand up without vomiting, my back/ side was in so much pain, high fever, kept going cold and hot, stomach hurting and obviously the peeing. my bf rushed me to the er bc this didn’t look normal, they took me in pretty fast and told me i had pyelonephritis (a kidney infection). they gave me antibiotics and put me onto an iv drip. i was actually very happy i thought that maybe i just had this all along and if i take these antibiotics everything will go back to normal. it was nothing like that.

finished those and i thought you know what im gonna treat myself to an iced coffee. i was in SO MUCH PAIN went back to the doctor, positive test, antibiotics, urine test…. endless cycle🙁🙁

sorry i this is rlly long but i just need some help i dont know what to do. this really affects my life and my mental health . im terrified at the fact it could be diabetes or another kidney infection. but is there anything else i could do guys bc i feel like im running out of options. thanks!",3,1771172707.0,TheGirlSurvivalGuide,8,0.72,False
1r5issf,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/1r5issf/i_started_to_romanticize_my_daily_routine_and_it/,I started to romanticize my daily routine and it completely changed how I feel.,"I didn't make a huge change in my life. I didn't move, I didn't change jobs, I didn't start a miracle diet, or anything dramatic.

I just started paying attention.

I realized I was spending my days on autopilot. I would wake up, do what I had to do, fulfill my responsibilities… and at the end of the day, I felt like nothing truly significant had happened.

So I decided to try something unusual: to start treating my days as if they were small scenes from a quiet movie.
My morning coffee stopped being ""something quick before heading out"" and started being ""my moment of silence.""
Walking stopped being just commuting and became ""my mental break.""
Even tidying the house became a way to organize my thoughts.

Nothing external changed much. But internally… it did.

I realized that many times we aren't dissatisfied with our lives, but rather disconnected from the small moments that make them up. I don't know if this will resonate with anyone else, but since I started doing this, I feel less anxiety about ""doing something big"" and more calm from simply being present.
