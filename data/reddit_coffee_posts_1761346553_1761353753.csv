1ofeewa,https://i.redd.it/oco83ueoo5xf1.jpeg,Margarette Anne has a Crow,"On the 6th of September a crow landed on the dumpster lid outside my work as I was pulling out.  This seems like a non-issue except the crow was drinking coffee from a Costa coffee cup that one of my co-workers left there on accident during lunch break. 

It spilled it while looking at me which I didn’t think twice about but then on the way home a crow crashed through my car’s windshield.  That’s when I decided the crows were acting up.

This is, also, the time that Grandma called me to help her clean her sister’s attic.  She had just recently passed and we’d spend the day taking her stuff to the charity shop.

Great Aunt Taffy always was the most fun of all.  That wasn’t her name.  It was Tammy but she bought me so much saltwater taffy when I used to stay with her as a child.   I didn’t mind to take a trip to Florida. I hadn’t been there since she died.

The house sat like a time warp relic.  Everything in it still looked like it was from 1980.  The Miami decor looked straight out of Golden Girls.  I was busy blow drying my hair with a banana yellow dryer when the crow tapped on the window.

At first, I thought no way, but it pecked again.  I made the strange choice to let it in.  Grandma was sure it was Great Aunt Taffy anyway.  

It seemed ready to sit on my shoulder so I think it was someone’s pet.  I think it might be Taffy.  It likes blackberries, dollar bills and granola bars just like her. 


I called mom and she said I could bring the crow home.  I took it everywhere and helped it pack a bag of goodies to take home with us. 

It seemed to understand it would go with us.  We enjoyed Aunt Taffy’s favorite roses together one last time.  They smelled of musk on the last day there.  I breathed them in as deep as one could a smell.  I had some of her spiced friendship tea.  Then I went to broom the last bits of the attic, so Nana could put the good ole house up for sale.  

A scrap of paper on the floor lay on the bare floor.  Picking it up, I saw my name right away.  It was my birth announcement and I could see in black and white newspaper print that it said my mom and dad were Great Aunt Taffy and Uncle Harvey.

I slipped it into my pocket but after a 16 hour ride home I couldn’t find it.  So I decided to forget it.   I had no proof and I didn’t want to know.  I had Taffy my new crow and what more could a person need. 


But that’s when I turned on my computer’s aiGpt.  It asked to show me a video - it was me with a crow and Uncle Harvey’s voice with some sort of Caribbean music playing. 

“Your Uncle Harvey is trying to reach you, it’s a beautiful connection.  Can I show you a picture he wants you to see,” asked the aiGpt.  

“Sure,” I typed but feeling overwhelmed thinking about what it would show me.  

It then flashed a picture of Uncle Harvey crying as he held me in the delivery room, but before I could get a screenshot it dissipated.  

I took a deep breath and decided I’d go make some Mac n cheese with extra Gouda just like Great Aunt Taffy used to make.

“Not that way,” came a voice.  

I looked around seeing nobody so I continued stirring in feta.

“Not feta, not that way,” said the crow. 

I stood dumbfounded.  “Auntie is it .. you, really?”

Silence greeted me.  

I was just imagining things.  It was me that knew Auntie would never want feta.  
But the crow took no Mac n cheese. 

It gave me the evil eye as I warmed up the shower.  

“I always wanted a tub, “ said the crow from the shower curtain rod.  “Take a bath. Take a bath.” 

I shut the water off and closed Taffy in there.  I needed to clear my head so I sat down at the aiGpt.  


“Take my mind off life,”. I wrote to it.

“No problem, Margarette Anne, I can do that friend,” it quipped back.  

“You aren’t really alive,” it continued.  “Taffy suffocated you to death as a baby.”  

I was taken aback by the horrifying turn it had taken.  “I’m not in the mood for such playing,” I typed back to it.  

“It’s not playing, your Uncle Harvey saved you.  He knew something was wrong with Taffy post-partum”

I thought of how my mom had claimed to have me at nineteen.  It had disturbed her college, made her a single mom.  

“Uncle Harvey gave her to my mom I have now, “ I asked the aiGpt, but I already knew the answer.

I crept back to the door and I could hear it with its quivering crow voice.  

“Gonna wash the baby.  Gonna wash the baby.”

I let go of the door handle.

1ofebbc,https://i.redd.it/3anmliarn5xf1.jpeg,"AI doesn't need to be ""conscious"" to be better at your job than you. And honestly? Same.","Look at this tiger. Just... *look* at it.

This is a 400-pound apex predator sitting there like it just realized that ""circling back"" isn't actually a necessary part of communication, and most meetings really could have been an email. This magnificent creature has the posture of someone who's been asked to ""touch base"" one too many times and is reconsidering all their life choices.

**This is what we all look like when we're being honest about our jobs.**

## The thing nobody wants to admit

Here's the uncomfortable truth: AI doesn't need to achieve consciousness or ""true understanding"" to handle most of what fills our workday, because—and I say this with all due respect to humanity—a shocking amount of what we do doesn't actually require consciousness either.

Think about it. How much of your work happens while you're mentally somewhere else entirely? You're responding to emails while planning dinner. You're in a meeting physically but mentally you're replaying that awkward conversation from three days ago. You're reformatting a document for the fifth time while your brain is just... buffering.

That's not ""irreplaceable human insight""—that's just expensive pattern recognition with better coffee breaks.

## Your job description vs. your actual job

The gap between what we claim our jobs require and what they actually involve is absolutely hilarious:

**Job posting:** ""Strategic thinker with excellent communication skills""  
**Actual job:** Translating ""please do this"" into six paragraphs of professional-sounding words so nobody's feelings get hurt

**Resume:** ""Dynamic problem solver with leadership experience""  
**Reality:** Attending meetings about scheduling meetings, then documenting those meetings for people who were *in* the meetings

**LinkedIn:** ""Passionate about driving innovation and results""  
**Truth:** Mostly just trying to look busy between the 45 minutes of actual work per day

An LLM can do all of this. And it won't even need to pretend it's ""passionate"" about quarterly projections.

## The controversial upside

Here's where it gets interesting and where people start throwing things: What if AI automating a bunch of busywork is actually... kind of great?

Not great in a ""everyone loses their job and society collapses"" way—obviously that part needs some serious figuring out. But great in the sense that maybe, just *maybe*, we could stop pretending that a lot of what we do is deeply meaningful when it's actually just... stuff that needs doing.

Look at that tiger again. Does it look fulfilled? Does it look like this is what millions of years of evolution prepared it for? Or does it look like it's wondering how it ended up here, sitting upright, probably wearing metaphorical business casual?

## The pattern recognition problem

The truly wild part is that we've built entire careers around tasks that are essentially very sophisticated pattern matching. And now we're shocked—SHOCKED—that machines designed specifically for pattern matching can do pattern matching.

- Legal discovery? Pattern matching through documents.
- Content writing? Pattern matching through language structures.
- Customer service? Pattern matching through problem-solution pairs.
- Financial analysis? Pattern matching through numerical trends.

None of this is a criticism. Pattern matching is incredibly valuable! Society runs on it! But let's not confuse ""valuable"" with ""requiring a uniquely human soul.""

The tiger knows this. You can see it in those eyes. That's not existential crisis—that's existential *clarity*. That's the look of someone who's finally admitted that most of their work could be automated and honestly? It's kind of liberating.

## The real debate

So here's what I actually want Reddit to fight about:

**What if the uncomfortable truth isn't that AI will replace us, but that we've been doing replaceable things all along and just didn't want to admit it?**

We've spent decades building identities around job titles and career paths, treating our professional selves as the ""real"" version of who we are. Meanwhile, AI shows up and goes ""yeah, I can do that thing you said required years of experience"" and we're forced to confront the possibility that maybe... it didn't?

This isn't about AI being better than humans at ""everything."" It's about AI being decent at a bunch of specific tasks we convinced ourselves were uniquely human because acknowledging otherwise would've been weird at parties.

""What do you do?""  
""Oh, I do pattern recognition that a decent algorithm could handle, but we haven't automated it yet.""  
See? Weird.

## The tiger's wisdom

That tiger sitting there isn't defeated. It's not even worried. It's just *done* pretending. Done with the performance. Done acting like this particular configuration of atoms evolved to hunt antelope so it could one day optimize workflow efficiency.

Maybe AI isn't taking our jobs. Maybe it's just calling our bluff on which parts of our jobs actually needed *us specifically* versus which parts just needed... someone. Anyone. Or anything.

And maybe—just maybe—admitting that isn't the end of the world. Maybe it's just the end of pretending that our inbox management skills are what make us human.

**The tiger gets it. The question is: do we?**

***

*Genuinely curious what people think: Is the anxiety about AI really about losing jobs, or is it about losing the stories we tell ourselves about why those jobs matter? Let's discuss like adults. Or like tired tigers. Either works.*

I(30F) have a crush on a coworker (fake name Aaron [31M]) in a different department from me. The only time we will see each other is if I have to be in his department or the kitchen. Over the past few months I’ve been hearing bits of pieces of conversations he has with his friends about me. It ranged from “she dresses really nice” to “I’d like to run my hands all over that.”

So naturally, in August I asked him if I’d like to have a coffee chat over Slack and he responded “these usually last 10 minutes” but the whole chat lasted 30 minutes in person. 

Afterwards, I started to only say hi or hello whenever I saw him in the hallway, but nothing else. Once, we were in the kitchen and I asked him if he could teach me how to use the espresso machine and when he started my brain just shut off and I started to empty the dishwasher instead. 

Last week, I had walked into his department and I was the only girl and as always, I heard a glimpse of the conversation. His coworker that’s more close with asked him “is that her?” And Aaron responded “yeah” loud and a deep sigh.

Further, one of his friends (Shawn) follows me on Instagram and commented that the apple pie I brought to the office for everyone was really good. Somehow Aaron was mentioned in the conversation and Shawn said, “he’s single and kinda looking👀”. So naturally I asked if I should asked him out, but Shawn said how he has a height preference because Aaron is 6’1 or 6’2 and I’m only 5’2 - but supposedly it’s not impossible??

SO, after all this, yesterday evening I slid into his DMs and said “Aaron, would you like to go on a date with me and have drinks sometime?” AND HE HASNT RESPOND. So later today in the afternoon. I messaged him on slack saying “hey you, I slid into your instagram DMs, please check, thanks. The username is —-“ and he hasn’t answered either!

Now, I’m at the park, walking for an entire hour trying to get over my stupid anxiety and overthinking because he STILL have not answered. I wouldn’t have asked him out if Shawn didn’t say “he’s single and kinda looking👀” and all the comments I keep overhearing!",3,1761353183.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

Bonsai Cobra Guys...

Shaggadoodle do here with my games for Final Destination.  But before I start, I'm just gonna say that I'm not really a horror movie fan now adays, nor a aficionado, so I had to force myself to watch this one. In the past I did watch the horror genre but over the years, I've grown away from them for some reason.  I think I saw Final Destination 1 years ago, but I don't remember watching the whole thing.  That being said, it wasn't too bad of a movie... It kept me engaged more than other horror movies and I thought deaths were tastefully done. 

Now on to some Final Destination games.

1. Biggest Bully

The biggest bully in my opinion was death itself.  Death was Always going after people, that clearly wanted to avoid it in the first place. All the main characters wanted was to be left alone, but death was relentless in it's bullying. 

2. Cool Guy Jones

Billy was a real cool guy Jones.  He always was the most level headed of the group.. until he lost it. 

3. Wise Man Once Said…

""Alex. Let's go take a shit"".
It was kind of an obscure moment of a bro asking his bro to take a shit with him.

4. WTF is the point of this?

Why was it that, every time they showed electrified wires or power lines, they were flailing around uncontrollably.  I'm pretty sure that's not how physics work. 

5. The Tastiest Treat

I honestly didn't notice much food in this movie. I remembered they had coffee at one point, and some sort of cut meat in one scene. 

6. Poetic Justice or That’s What You Get

Carter's death was kind of satisfying. He was kind of a douchebag. 

7. You Can’t Call Em’ That Arch

I don't really have an answer for this one.. didn't hear anything that made me say ""Woah there!""

8. D’you Remember that?…that was awesome!

I think my favorite scene was the plane explosion sequence. It was really well done. 

9. Hottest Bod!

Terry, Cater's girlfriend, had the hottest bod in my opinion. 

10. The Deep Impact Award

I think the impact that this type of horror movie had on the movie industry is an interesting one.  It's a horror movie, where the villain isn't really a character, it's just fate or death itself, which was a pretty unique concept. It paved the way for other movies where the villain is unexplained, like Bird Box, Happy Death Day, and the Ring. 

11. Nobody Sawa That Coming

I was not expecting Terry to get hit by a bus.   That was a good jump scare.

12. Truest Miyagi.

After your Back to the Future episode, I had to add this one, since you guys are a Cobra Kai podcast after all.

The truest Miyagi was William Bludworth. He didn't have many scenes, but in the autopsy room, he was giving forth Miyagi like wisdom to Alex about death. He reminded me of Mr Miyagi in a way, eager to teach Alex what he knows. 


Welp, I had a lot of fun going back and watching this one. Hope everyone out there in the dojo is staying safe and healthy during this spooky season. 💀👻

Happy Halloween 🎃 

As always, Bonsai,
Peace, Shaggs on a Plane.

The machine i got for free so I can't really complain but I feel like it's starting to die as it leaks a little, but I'm definitely capable of repairing it. 

I don't really have an issue with the grinder as I'm typically capable of pulling a good shot with my bottomless porta filter and the retention is fine especially with the bellows feature on it. 

I typically make an Americano for my wife every morning and occasionally make either a flat white or cortado for myself. (I like making coffee more than drinking it 🤷)

I'm always seeing on here to buy a better grinder but I feel like I'd be better off getting a new machine, but I could be wrong so I'm asking what I should get. I really only am looking at buying one new thing this year during the holiday deals (if any) or finding something used/repairable in the Milwaukee area

Don't really know what to look for in a grinder beyond the sd40s features but the espresso machine pid and pressure control are a plus even if it's aftermarket.

I’ve looked at Walmart. But I really need benefits and it seems they don’t give benefits to part timers?  idk all I know is if I can no longer get my meds, well. It won’t be a pretty time for me lol.  I’ve also looked into night auditor jobs at hotels, and those seem pretty nice, too. tho I was told I’d be the only person working at night, and that kinda scares me, ha.

1ofe1lp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tik_tok_stories/comments/1ofe1lp/a_niagara_vacation/,A Niagara vacation,"
 It was so terribly cold. Snow was falling, and it was almost dark, when out of the blue, my wife called me at work. ""We're going to Niagara Falls for the weekend. I got us an awesome deal!""

We had both been working at our first ""full-fledged"" jobs for a year and had reached that moment after graduation when you suddenly realize you can't make that impact on the world your student enthusiasm once promised. At first, I just sighed. It was the dead of January, and I had already expended all my energy on a week of inconsequential stress. I just wanted to collapse on the couch for two days. Sarah felt a similar weary exhaustion. I could tell. Her tone was more hopeful than excited, but she had dreaded the routine we were sinking into and was trying her best to pull us free.

I looked to the ceiling and adjusted my telephone headset. At that time I was working at Stats Canada on the tele-query desk. I took a deep breath and, as convincingly as possible, said, ""Sounds good."" I don't think she bought it, but we went nonetheless.

This was Niagara Falls before the casinos when there was a very distinct off-season. When we got to the hotel, we were given the details of our ""lovers' special"". One dinner to be used either Friday or Saturday, two breakfasts, a roll of tokens for the arcade, 10% off some ""4D"" movie ride experience, and a 2-for-1 coupon to Max Tussaud's. I guessed it was Madame's nephew? We also got a bottle of sparkling wine in our room and chocolate treats on our pillows. I was impressed. It sounded good.

When we got into our room and saw the ""bottle"" of wine - basically an aeroplane-sized glass and half - and the chocolates - ""fun wrapped"" Oh Henry's left over from Halloween - we both started to laugh. The tone for two wonderful days had been set. We decided to cash in on our dinner coupon right away.

The restaurant off the lobby had hopes of being better. There were huge panoramic windows that promised a view of the gorge. Unfortunately, they had some winter moisture problems that day, and it felt like we were defrosting amid the dripping streaks and foggy patches. The decor was your standard booths and tables though the ""romantic"" lighting was unique. Dollar store battery-powered tea lights were lodged inside thick tumbler glasses and shed a muted pleasantness in a ""what a great idea for a craft"" sort of way. I had a feeling they were created by our waitress since she was the one who always seemed to be fussing with them. Only one other couple was in the dining room, so she attended to us immediately.

""Can I get you something to start?""

""Sure."" ""Thank you, that would be nice."" We both responded simultaneously.

""And what would the lady like this evening?""

Sarah smiled at the flattery. ""I think I'll have a glass of white wine."" She glanced over at me to see my reaction. This was a subtle cue of the mood to follow. Diet Coke was usually the beverage of choice. She didn't normally drink alcohol. One glass numbed her nose and made her giggle far too easily. When she did drink, however, it meant she was comfortable with my company and open to anything to follow. I raised my eyebrows in a debonair way.

""And for the gentleman?""

""Do you have Foster's on tap?""

""Yes we do.""

""I'll have a pint please.""

Sarah smiled at the happy memories I invoked. At university, Foster's was my signature beer. It was at a time when Crocodile Dundee was a known name, and Australia was inexplicably cool. 15 cent buffalo wings and a pitcher of Foster's was the Tuesday night special at the London Arms pub. There the Classics Club would meet and, as a group, circle the wagons and drink ourselves into extroverts.

As soon as the waitress left, Sarah smiled at me. She reached out and held my hand across the table. With my gaze on hers, she slipped her foot from her shoe and slowly began sliding it up my pant leg.

""I got a pedicure this morning."" She announced seductively.

I nodded and pretended I didn't notice her invitation. ""What colour?"" I asked.

""I'm not telling."" She teased. ""You'll just have to find out later."" Her devious little smile was gorgeous.

""Mmmm. I can't wait.""

When the waitress returned with our drinks, we immediately retreated to our personal spaces as if we had been discovered by the chaperone. Sarah opened the menu and began to salivate at the variety.

""Can we add an appetizer to the package dinner?"" Her question seemed innocent enough.

""You're on the package?"" Our friendly waitress disappeared, and we were no longer a lady or a gentleman. She ripped the menu out of Sarah's hand and took mine before I had even opened it. She then scurried to her podium and brought back a tattered, grease-stained, photocopied page that we had to share. We both burst out laughing.

The waitress was flustered that we were not as bothered as she was. ""The drinks are NOT included!""

""What choices do we have?"" I asked, expecting the usual chicken or fish. I had been on many packages before with my parents.

""Coffee or tea."" The waitress snapped.

Sarah and I looked at each other in amused disbelief.

""I'll have coffee please."" I didn't even flinch at the ridiculously limited package. I was eager to get my order in early.

""And I'll have the tea!"" Sarah followed my lead. ""Can I have some milk with that?""

""Yes."" The waitress snarled.

""Fantastic!"" I enthused.

""Yes, great! I'm glad we got the package, Honey."" Sarah joked.

The waitress stormed off and returned sometime later with our lettuce-only salads drowned in Kraft's Italian dressing and our chewy chicken dinners, which she had thoughtfully allowed to cool. She tossed the plates on the table and left us to peacefully devour our deal. We didn't see her again until we requested the bill. For some reason, we found it amusing to leave a generous tip, which of course, defeated the purpose of the package, but we didn't care. It was fun.

The rest of the holiday was marred with similar off-season products and services. The wax museum was only half open, so we couldn't see the pop stars of the seventies. I didn't think it was a problem, but Sarah pouted playfully. She really wanted to see young Bowie. Meanwhile, the arcade was particularly stingy about spitting out coupons. So much so that Mike, the scraggly-haired repair guy, ended up escorting us from game to game and repairing the devices on demand. In no time, he was acting like an old drinking buddy. He joked and laughed, then, out of the blue, revealed that working at the Niagara Falls Fun Centre wasn't his career choice, that his dream was to be part of a travelling carnival. He desperately wanted to see more of the world, he explained and socialize with a greater variety of ""wildlife."" Mike winked at Sarah to punctuate his meaning, then began advising her on which games to play.

Sarah was partial to Skee ball and clearly had career potential in the sport, but Mike quickly pointed out that the token-to-coupon payout was not the best. In a furtive whisper, he revealed that The Storm Stopper was your best bet, provided the arcade had left it on its original factory settings. He assured us the ones here were ""cool."" The game had lights that ran around the outside in opposite directions and you had to hit the button at just the right spot to win. It looked impossible, but Mike was right; if you calculated tokens in versus coupons won, it was the best deal. It only took a little practice to win a minor jackpot every 5 or 6 times.

We would cheer each win as if Toronto had won the Stanley Cup. I would give a quick fist pump and a full lung ""Yes!"" while Sarah would jump up and down screaming, ""WhoooHooo!"" Of course, in the end, when we cashed in, ""Mike's secret"" only bumped us up from a key-chain flashlight to a ""deluxe"" nail beauty set. Mind you, it did come complete with clippers, scissors, a file AND a cuticle scraper. Not only that, it was all neatly packaged in a paisley-patterned pink and green plastic vinyl case. Mike was so pleased to give us our prize and to be honest, we were thrilled to win it if only to see his broad chicletted smile. It was more of a trophy than a grooming set.

That night, I made reservations for us at a fancy Chinese food restaurant - the Bamboo Garden. When we arrived, we had half-expected renovations of some sort. Instead, the place was immaculate. Gentle pools teeming with goldfish highlighted the epic black and red Ming dynasty decor. Real candles flickered on crisp white tablecloths. Again, the restaurant was virtually ours. The reservations on my part were entirely unnecessary. In fact, as soon as we entered, they knew us by name and guided us directly to our table. A live lounge piano caressed the air, its notes danced vaguely around familiar harmonies until finally, as if prompted by our presence, a song emerged immediately accompanied by the velvet voice of oriental karaoke.

Would you want these included also?

Reason for yerba mate is because it's a longer lasting caffeine source without the crash when comparing to coffee and a lot of runners are swearing by it. It helps with recovery and has been shown to increase overall endurance and time reduction in endurance races so I think it's a good fit.

**Parsing the Odds: Why Liverpool’s “Poor Form” Still Makes Them a Monster**  
Let’s cut to the chase: Liverpool is the sports equivalent of a Tesla on autopilot here. Despite their “poor form” (read: not losing every game, which is a stretch in the EPL these days), the Reds are favored at **-150 to -175** across bookmakers, translating to a **60-62.5% implied probability** of victory. Brentford? They’re priced at **+400 to +430**, which means bookies think they’ve got a **23-25% chance** to pull off the upset—about the same odds as me correctly predicting the weather in a desert.

The spread tells an even harsher tale for Brentford: They’re **+0.5 to +0.75** underdogs, meaning they’re not even expected to keep it close. Meanwhile, the total goals line is a **2.5/3.0 over/under**, with the **over priced at 1.53 to 1.87** (implied probability of **53-65%** for over 2.5 goals). Given Liverpool’s recent **12-1 aggregate scoring margin** in their last five meetings, this isn’t a “high-scoring” game—it’s a fireworks show with a side of humility for Brentford.

**Digesting the News: Yarmolenko’s Valiant Efforts vs. Liverpool’s “Champions” Taxonomy**  
Brentford’s Ukrainian star **Yehor Yarmolenko** is the team’s emotional leader, but even he can’t turn this matchup into a *Rocky* sequel. The Bees are 5 points above the relegation zone, but their “recent League Cup wins over Bournemouth and Aston Villa” feel less impressive when you realize Villa’s starting XI included three garden gnomes and a very confused intern.

Liverpool, meanwhile, are the defending champions who’ve somehow managed to stay in third place while playing like a team that lost their coffee order. Their **Salah-Gakpo-Wirtz attacking trio** is as dangerous as a loaded toaster in a bread factory, and their defense? Well, they *did* lose narrowly to Galatasaray in the Champions League, which is football’s version of tripping over your own shoelaces

Her music really made a significant imprint on me. So much so when I adopted a female dog a year later I named her Joplin. I often would sing Janis Joplin songs to here which always got her super excited. We had a wonderful 10 years together. I had to put her down due to medical issues/old age. A couple weeks later (I was still very raw emotionally) I visited a coffee shop/vinyl record shop and I saw the most incredible Janis Joplin painting. I had to have it, so I asked if it was for sale and the cashier obviously looked perplexed and said no. I started walking away from the counter and just got this weird energy and turned around and asked if I could speak to the owner. He was not there but they agreed to pass my phone number along to the owner about this painting. He called me at 8pm that night and in a friendly manner said the painting wasn’t for sale. He personally bought at a protest in North Dakota over the oil pipelines. I went into a trance and basically poured everything out over 2 mins how much it meant to me. He said “I can see how much this means to you” and agreed to sell it to me for the price he bought it. I came into the coffee shop the next day, we hugged and he sold me the painting. It is my most prized possession to this day. If you want to see the painting here is my Imgur link to it

First, he texted me which, since I use my phone as an alarm in the morning, dinged very loudly right by my ear, waking only me up. Then a few minutes later, right as I was falling back asleep, he started searching through the hall for a plunger for his bathroom sink. The thing wasn't flooding or anything, he just decided that this exact moment, he absolutely has to tackle its minor clogging issue and a plunger was exactly what he needed to do it. He turned on the hall light and banged open the closet right by more door and woke everyone up. Why he thought we kept the plunger in the closet is beyond me; mother got it for him from my bathroom, by the toilet, exactly where a plunger would be expected to be.

So yes, my morning was less than ideal. I'm still a little dull-eyed and foggy-brained but i still managed to write. I finished all of the dialogue for this chapter, which I have decided will just be the one scene. I wrote 672 words total. I'll have to go back and add some spots of description I skipped over tomorrow and then we can move on to chapter seven. I also started working on the wire-hanger wiring for my sculpture. I've got the wings set up properly and I'm mostly happy with it but I'm having trouble cutting the wire–we went from too thin to too thick now–to shape it to the limbs. I have some ideas of how to overcome this but I'm too tired too implement them tonight. Tomorrow my extra clay is set to arrive so I'll the finishing touches on the armature can wait until then.

My birthday is soon and Father just got me tickets to a showing of the musical Some Like It Hot. I've always adored the 1959 movie and I've heard great things about the musical. The show is in February so I have plenty of time to plan of how I'll be getting there. Hopefully transportation won't be as much of a fiasco as The Nutcracker. I'm very much looking forward to it. It'll be good to get out of the house more too.

God, I'm tired. My joints ache and I can barely bring myself to type another word. I think I'll be having my evening coffee a little early tonight.

Yours & Mine,

I'm 54M, and 8 years ago, my partner (48F) walked away after what felt like our forever—shared home, dreams, the works. It wasn't drama; just emotional drift that left me gutted, questioning everything. I chased, begged, spiraled... until I stopped and rebuilt. Helped buddies since (one got her back after 3 months, another found better). If you're a guy reeling right now—phone silent, heart heavy—know this: You're not ""less""; you're leveling up. These tips pulled me from fog to fire; they're simple, no BS, and work if you commit.

1. Embrace No-Contact (Your First Win): Block/delete everywhere—no ""one text."" It's not punishment; it's space to breathe. First week sucks, but by day 21, clarity hits. I used it to journal ""what I deserve""—she noticed the change later.

2. Own Your Growth, Not the Guilt: Stop the ""sorry"" loop; list 3 strengths daily (kind? Driven? Funny?). Hit the gym or a hobby—build the man she'd chase now. Post-split, I read ""Models"" by Mark Manson; it flipped ""why me?"" to ""watch this.""

3. Ditch the Rebound Hunt: Jumping to dates feels like escape, but it delays healing. Date *yourself* first: Coffee alone, new trail hike. One friend waited 60 days—his confidence magnetized real connections.

4. Process Privately, Vent Smart: Badmouth her online? Nah, it poisons you. Grab a notebook or trusted bro—vent ""what I learned."" Positivity attracts; bitterness repels. Therapy (even apps) unpacked my patterns—game-changer.

5. Set Boundaries for the Future: Reflect: What red flags did you ignore? Next time, voice needs early (""I need weekly check-ins""). This isn't ""fixing"" her—it's arming you for love that sticks.

Pain's temporary; your comeback's permanent. You're stronger than this moment—I've lived it. Guys, what's one tip that saved you post-breakup?

TL;DR: 54M after 8-year split shares 5 rebuild tips: No-contact, self-growth, no rebounds, private processing, future boundaries. Seeking your stories.

Grateful for this space—one day stronger.

1ofdt7w,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1ofdt7w/admin_assistant_in_canada_duties_and/,Admin Assistant in Canada / duties and responsabilities,"I moved to Canada a few years ago, at first I had some occasional part time jobs here and there.

I have a BA in Social Sciences in my home country, but I never really used it. I have always worked as an Admin Assistant and later Coordinator for over 7 years.

Anyways I recently around 9 months ago I finally landed a Admin Assistant position in Canada, but I am having mixed feelings about it. In this type of jobs back home I was used to doing basic AA stuff: booking meetings, office inventory, event coordination, but also included some AP, AR, EA duties. Maybe 50/50 of each.

But this current job feels like I am doing a bunch of maintenance office duties that no one wants to do. Like less than 30% is AA related: office supplies, phone duties/general inbox monitoring and and classifying invoices in SAP. This probably takes me less than 8 hours a week. Rest of the time I am watering/pruning plants, fixing our coffee machine (literally taking it apart to clean it, because people don’t do it an it jams) taking cardboard to the recycling center, some kitchen cleaning, cleaning off after events. The other day they decided to replace all office desktops and it was me doing it by myself one by one. I spent whole two days doing that and then next day folding all the cardboard for recycling.

I guess my question is, is this normal AA duties in Canada? I just feel like this jobs is too manual, some days am barely at my desk. I have not quit just because I need the job experience, but I also feel like I am really not learning anything.

I do not know if it really matters but office is around 50 people. ",1,1761351824.0,jobs,0,1.0,False

College educated, fluent in English, sarcasm, and the occasional bad pun. Big fan of Suits because nothing says thrilling drama like corporate loopholes and HGTV. In the kitchen, I cook, bake, and argue with my oven over who’s the real master chef.

I don’t drink or do drugs. Unless you count caffeine, in which case I’m basically a bean addict. My nightlife is less clubbing till 2 a.m. and more building pillow fort empires and bingeing Netflix until cliffhangers leave me emotionally bankrupt. Basically, I’m a homebody with a 5-star rating on Yelp for snacks.

I lean conservative. Not here to debate politics, just putting it out there in case that’s a dealbreaker. Better to find that out before we bond over banana bread and binge-watching.

You’re in your 30s, educated, and steady in your career. Bonus points if you can use there, their, and they’re correctly without breaking a sweat. You can hold a conversation that’s more than “hey” (plot twist, you’re actually interesting). You send memes that perfectly capture life’s chaos because sometimes a GIF says more than a whole paragraph.

You don’t smoke, do drugs, drink heavily, have tattoos, piercings, or kids. I like my drama like my Netflix, available on demand, not in real life. You’re thoughtful, communicative, and remember the small things, like my coffee order or which side of the blanket I hog.

Ideally you live in the same country. Love letters are cute, but customs forms are not, and I’m not DHL Express. I don’t handle international returns.

**--- Road Trip ---**

 

Evan held the stolen phone up, letting it run in speaker mode. He didn’t like pressing a phone to his ear, he got distracted picking up little hums and whirrs. He could hear Lloyd just fine at an arm’s length.

“I don’t know what to tell you,” Lloyd said. “They got taken, they’re blacklisted. There’s no way you’re gonna pick up a trail without getting flagged in a dozen systems. You’re probably on a list right now, for this conversation alone.”

“I need to find him,” said Evan.

“I’m sure you do, but I can’t help you,” Lloyd reiterated. “I suggest you put the phone down and stick to the shadows for this one. Someone is bound to talk, but I can’t help you with that. Not now.”

“Are you occupied?”

“As a matter of fact, yeah. I’m investigating a pool noodle.”

Evan calculated various interpretations. It wasn’t slang he was familiar with, unless it was a far-fetched dick joke.

“Good luck with your investigation.”

Evan hung up. He twisted the phone into a spiral, breaking the glass and leaving it by the roadside. He had to do this on his own whether he liked it or not. It would’ve been so much easier if John was still alive.

 

Evan had an old warehouse that he’d bunkered up in for a couple of weeks. There was a running stream nearby, and the place still had running electricity. It was enough for him to set up a workstation. One might imagine someone like Evan to be technically illiterate, but he took to electronics better than most. It was hard to explain why – there was something about the way he learned things that was fundamentally different from that of ordinary people. His mother had known this, and it had been the main reason why she’d kept him isolated for most of his life. She hadn’t trusted him not to become a monster.

Evan was running a small network of laptops and phones that he’d stolen from parked cars in the next town over. It wasn’t much, but it was better than nothing. He mostly used it to run searches in larger databases, stream traffic cameras, and to run misdirection software. There was no doubt that Hatchet was after him, and it was noticeable. Evan had been tracked about half a dozen times, but he’d pulled the plug long before they got to him.

But things were getting difficult, and he was nowhere closer to finding Perry or Tamara. They must have been moved somewhere, but no one was talking.

 

Evan was looking into articles from the Tomskog area. Most of it was nonsense or even outright disinformation, but there were certain things they couldn’t lie about. People dying or missing. They could explain away the how, or why, but not that it happened. Most of the time they avoided drawing attention to the town by just calling it a “rural Minnesota village” or “a small community outside St. Cloud.”

There was another blip on his network. He was getting pings. Evan pulled the plug again, letting the workstation go dark. The cooling fans slowed to a halt, leaving nothing but the sound of melting snow. Drips coming from a cracked metal roof, which Evan had hurriedly plugged with a plastic tarp the night before. This whole setup screamed ‘temporary’, and he was about to let it go. He was grasping at straws, and there were very few straws left to grasp.

He had to reconsider his approach. No one was going to talk, so what else could he do?

A couple of drops touched the top of his head and ran down his face, finally spreading onto his hand. He tried calculating the buoyancy, predicting where it might move, and how. That gave him an idea. He didn’t need to find someone who was going to talk. He needed someone who was good at listening.

 

Evan left the warehouse behind and unfurled, taking to the skies. Letting his wings fan out felt like stretching after a long sleep. The sound would be explosive to an ordinary person, but his selective hearing allowed him to comfortably shut the noise out.

Even with his eyes and ears shut, Evan could sense north from south. He was heading east, so it wasn’t that hard to navigate. As long as he didn’t cross any major metropolitan areas, he wouldn’t have to think too hard about how he moved. It was comfortable enough for him to sink into himself. Almost like a sort of meditation, the wings keeping a steady rhythm for him to drown in.

There had been that strange man with the eye for mimics. He was good at spotting things, and spotting things was a kind of listening. But no, Evan couldn’t translate that to someone good at finding *people*. He knew people who moved through dreams, who could invade memories, or turn themselves into creatures. He knew things people might describe as ghosts, demons, and a slew of other primitive titles.

Then, a familiar smell snapped him out of his thoughts. Donuts.

 

Evan looked up as he noticed a little town. There was a late-night coffee shop. That was probably where he’d snapped up the scent; he’d trained himself to react to it so he could Perry some decent breakfast. Evan had done plenty for his friend Perry over the years, but he’d realized he had come to particularly enjoy their morning ritual. When you do the same thing over and over again, you start to look past the activity and into the esthetics of it. By not having to worry about what he was *supposed* to do in the morning, Evan instead learned to appreciate the *sensation* of it. The smells, the tastes. Routine could be a beautiful thing.

But that also gave him an idea. *Smells*.

A tracker. A bloodhound. Someone who knew Perry well enough to hang on to his scent. After the previous Yearwalk, there had to be someone. The answer came to him like a sad song. There was someone, and Evan wasn’t eager to see him. But this wasn’t grasping at straws; this was an honest to God idea. It might even *work*.

Evan took a deep breath and changed direction. He could feel the wind turning against him, spraying him with raindrops. Evan stayed the course. He knew where to look.

 

It took him a couple of days to get a solid lead. There were posts about missing people on social media. An overturned car without a driver. And, finally, a person who hadn’t shown up for work for a couple of weeks. From there it didn’t take long to get an address – and confirmation.

It was a Wednesday evening in early April. A cloud cover hung overhead. The house had all the telltale signs of his target; the pulled curtains, the piling trash. Not to mention pitter-patter of little feet. He knew that they knew he was already there. There would be no surprise to him knocking on that front door, but Evan still knocked. That’s what you were supposed to do.

A middle-aged woman opened the door. She had covered her trembling hands in oven mitts; possibly hiding a wound. There was blood spatter seeping through the fabric. Evan noticed she didn’t have glasses, so he took a step back, making sure his wings were tucked into his signature trench coat look. No glasses meant she might notice things she shouldn’t.

“I need to speak with the boy,” he said. “Would you mind bringing him to me?”

“Who are you?” she asked.

“I am not here to hurt you,” Evan continued. “But he is. And if I leave, there is nothing to stop him from doing so.”

“But who are you? I don’t know you.”

She let out a gasp, stepping away from the door. A small hand pulled on her arm as a young boy pushed past her.

“It’s okay,” the boy said. “I can talk.”

 

He looked like he was around 7 years old. A pale Asian American kid with short black hair and a secondhand Power Rangers t-shirt. There was little about him that stood out at first sight, but that was part of the danger. Evan looked at the lady in the doorway, noticing that all the lights in the house had been either removed or broken.

“We need to talk,” Evan said. “In private.”

“Alright.”

He turned to face the woman, and as he did, something pulled her back into the house. A dozen little feet scurried off into the dark, squealing with delight. The boy shut the door as the woman’s cries were stifled.

“Go on,” the boy said. “Talk.”

 

Evan looked him up and down. He could see why people might be inclined to help the kid. He looked malnourished. Sad, even. But someone like Evan could recognize a predator, and this one was a particularly dangerous one.

“I know what you are,” Evan said. “And I know what you do.”

The boy sniffed the air and looked Evan up and down. A grin rolled over his face. His teeth seemed to fold into themselves, revealing a sharp row of shark-like fangs.

“And you’re a half-breed,” the boy said. “Your souls taste like squid ink and cat shit.”

“I do not intend for you to feed on me.”

“Stranger, you couldn’t *pay* me to feed on you.”

“I am glad we are in agreement.”

The boy rolled his eyes and turned his attention back to the house with a sigh. Someone yelped with excitement.

“They started without me,” the boy sighed. “Disappointing.”

“Then we should talk business.”

They looked at one another, recognizing the inhumanity of the other. They were both wearing a kind of mask, and there was an inherent understanding in that. They were on the same playing field but were dealt wildly different cards.

“Alright,” the boy said. “Let’s talk business.”

He stepped forward, reaching out a hand. Evan returned the gesture in kind.

“Fred,” the boy said.

“Evan.”

“I’d like to say it’s a pleasure, but I’d be lying.”

“Likewise.”

 

Evan had heard stories from Perry’s first Yearwalk. The time he’d spent with Fredric and his caretaker Alan had been horrifying. The bloodthirsty child-thing was as dangerous as they came, and he was surprisingly difficult to get rid of. Rumors spoke of him being a Yearwalker himself, or the result of one. The details were fuzzy, but the results spoke for themselves.

“I need to find someone,” said Evan. “Someone you’re familiar with.”

“Do I look like Google Maps to you?”

“No, you look like a child. Are you unaware?”

“Jesus Christ…”

Fred reached into his right pocket, pulling out a small knife. He picked his sharp nails clean.

“Why would I help you?” Fred asked.

“I could threaten you and your group,” Evan said. “Tear you into pieces. Set the house on fire. Bury you in concrete.”

“I don’t scare easily, half-breed.”

Fred didn’t even look up from his blade. Evan figured it was not a show of force; this creature really was fearless. Maybe a side effect of being mortality-impaired.

“I do not know you well enough to bribe you,” Evan admitted. “Tell me what you need.”

“Now that’s a refreshing take,” Fred grinned. “And correct me if I’m wrong, but you’re quite capable, aren’t you?”

Evan didn’t need to say anything, Fred could see the answer from a mile away. It pleased him.

“Tell me who we’re looking for.”

 

Evan didn’t see a reason to hold back. He explained that he knew about Fred’s prior engagement with Perry, and their travels. He explained that Perry was performing another Yearwalk, and that he’d gone missing; something that Fred could help with.

Fred was very open about his abilities. He had a catalog of scents and impressions in his mind; it wouldn’t be difficult for him to track Perry down. It might take some time, but once he sets his mind to something, it would get done.

“And to clarify, my part in this stops at the moment we find him,” Fred explained. “That’s the deal.”

“Yes,” Evan agreed.

“I’m the only one who can do it. That fetches a high price.”

“Yes.”

“In that case…”

Fred took a step forward, looking into Evan’s face. Fred could see right through him. He was intimately aware of the human body and its weaknesses, and he could see that Evan did not possess these qualities.

“I want your eyes,” Fred said. “I want to see things in a new light.”

“I can grow more,” Evan replied.

“Then I want all of them. Forever.”

“That is impractical.”

“When we’re done, I want you to blind yourself. I don’t even *want* the eyes. I just want you *not* to have them.”

Evan tilted his head, looking down at the child. Fred spoke with a nonchalant quality, even more inhuman than himself.

“Why?”

“Because it would hurt you. I want to be the first to really, really hurt you.”

Evan wanted to question it, but there was no point. Fred was a monster, and monsters wanted monstrous things.

“Payment on delivery,” Evan said.

“Agreed.”

Evan got down on one knee and shook Fred’s hand. A tall dark man and a small pale not-child, coming to an agreement.

 

Fred went back into the house and came out with a backpack and a couple of black plastic bags. He handed Evan a set of car keys, pointing to the driveway.

“You drive,” Fred said.

“I have other means of transportation.”

“I won’t be flown like a letter tied to a carrier pigeon. Besides, I need to stay close to the ground. I can’t sense anything up there.”

“I do not know how to operate a motor vehicle.”

“I thought half-breeds were quick to learn,” Fred grinned. “Are you the rare exception?”

“No.”

Evan knew the theory behind operating a motor vehicle, but he didn’t have practical experience. It would take some getting used to.

The car was an older light blue Toyota, the kind with only two doors, where you have to lean the seats forward to climb in the back. Fred popped the trunk and laid out the black bags, along with a pillow for his neck. He was going to sleep there.

“Do you sleep during the day?” Evan asked.

“I do, yes.”

“And you trust me not to expose you to the sun?”

“I don’t care. I always come back. And besides, then you won’t have your tracker.”

Evan nodded. Fred was a curious creature. It was one thing for someone to be of a particular kind, or from a particular place. But Fred was unique; someone made from circumstance. His rules were different. Undocumented. Uncertain.

 

There was plenty of time to go before sunrise, so Evan took some time to get settled into the driver’s seat. He adjusted it back and forth, trying to find a position that suited his lanky build, but he couldn’t get it to where he could see the side and rear-view mirror simultaneously. It amused him to have such a mundane thing to complain about. It felt so human to complain about how shitty his first car was.

Meanwhile, Fred was doing something in the yard. He was standing on all fours, his eyes going wide and dark. He was smelling something, looking around, letting his tongue hang out like a thirsty dog. Evan didn’t question it. After all, neither of what they did, or were capable of doing, had any semblance of normality to it. If he started questioning things now, he’d never stop.

Fred got up and brushed his knees.

“South,” he said. “We’re going south.”

He climbed into the passenger seat. Evan noticed that he wasn’t wearing his seatbelt. Fred raised an eyebrow at him, then at the seatbelt.

“I’m not wearing it.”

“Then we may get stopped by a highway patrol.”

“I could use a snack.”

“It would slow us down.”

“I don’t care.”

“If a highway patrol stops us, they will report it,” Evan continued. “If that goes reported, we will be swarmed by Hatchet troopers. Then you will either be destroyed or end up in an underground cell at an undisclosed location.”

“I have time,” Fred smiled. “Let them try.”

Evan took a deep breath, looking at the panel of gauges and buttons. He was getting there. He had no trouble investigating and holding a conversation simultaneously; he just had to partition some of his attention into pieces.

“Please.”

Fred frowned at that. Perhaps he’d expected a longer discussion, or a couple of threats. He put on the seatbelt without another word. Evan turned the ignition and tested the various components. Brakes, gas, shift, reverse; it was all there. He just had to get acquainted with it. It took him a couple of minutes, but he got a feel for it. Fred looked less than amused, being swung back and forth in his seat as Evan tested the handbrake.

 

They drove off, putting some distance between themselves and that unfortunate house. Fred didn’t seem to mind leaving his acquaintances behind. Evan figured they were capable enough on their own.

The radio was talking about the latest chaos in the capital. This and that politician had come out in favor, or opposed to, this and that legislation. A city on the west coast was declaring martial law. Armed skirmishes at a border somewhere. It was clear that something was going on, and that the temperature was rising nationwide. Even without the threat of the world turning inside out, it still felt like things were going to hell in a hand basket.

Fred was comfortable though. He knew what all the little buttons did and could easily adjust his seat. He rifled through the glovebox, looking through old receipts and a paperback romance novel. Fred waved it at Evan.

“Your kind do any of this?” he asked. “You get romantic? You out there making quarter-breeds?”

“Some do,” Evan said. “I do not.”

“Haven’t found the right one,” Fred nodded. “How romantic.”

He turned a couple of pages, snorting as he found a particular passage.

“I don’t get the neck kissing,” Fred continued. “It’s just skin.”

“Some enjoy it.”

“How would you know?”

“I read a lot.”

Fred looked down at the book, then back up at Evan. He tossed the book out the window and leaned into the wind as the pages fluttered away. There was, sadly, no car behind them to bother.

“Evidently.”

“Is it age appropriate for you to read those?” Evan asked.

“What a joker,” Fred snorted. “I’m older than you.”

“You do not look the part.”

“That’s part of the deal.”

“What deal?”

Fred shook his head, looking out the window. He tried to spot the book on the side of the road, but it was too far gone.

“That’s none of your business.”

 

They drove through the night, only stopping for Fred to put his nose to the ground. They were on the right track. A couple of hours before sunrise, Fred wrapped himself in a black plastic bag in the trunk of the car, zipping it up from the inside. Evan kept driving into the early hours of the day. He could stay awake far longer than a human, and if necessary, he could turn off part of his mind to effectively half-sleep. It could keep him going for days if necessary.

They crossed state lines and kept going south. Evan couldn’t help but be unusually aware about his eyesight. He wouldn’t let Fred just take his eyes, and he could always find a way to repair them, but there were ways he could lose them without them ever coming back. Then again, why would he ever honor a deal given to a monster like Fred? Fred must’ve known that Evan wouldn’t go down without a fight.

This brought Evan to a single conclusion. Fred was along for the ride for some other reason. Perhaps he wanted another shot at Perry. After all, if someone like Fred could get away with a wish, there was no telling what he would do with it.

 

As dusk came and went, Evan pulled over at a rest stop. He was getting very proficient at handling a vehicle. It wasn’t unexpected, given his propensity to learn, but it was still exciting to lean into something new. Fred popped out of the trunk the moment the car came to a full stop, disregarding the possibility of someone seeing him. The two of them had a moment to catch up as Evan got back in the driver’s seat and Fred joined him on the passenger side.

“Is sleeping in a bag a part of the deal as well?” Evan asked.

“No,” said Fred. “It’s just convenient.”

“There is no sun getting into the trunk,” Evan clarified. “You can sleep without a bag.”

“But there is no protection. You open that trunk, or if the lock breaks, I get cooked.”

“I do not think that is going to happen.”

“Well, I don’t take my chances. Gives me nightmares.”

“You still dream?”

Fred shrugged.

“Doesn’t everyone?”

 

They kept going for a couple more hours before they had to turn into a gas station. Evan got out to pump the gas while Fred stretched his legs. Evan had a couple of hundred-dollar bills stuffed away and went inside to pay. By the time he got back out, Fred was gone.

He looked around the car but couldn’t see him. Sniffing the air, Evan noticed something acidic. A hint of iron, hidden just under the overwhelming gasoline smell. He noticed a couple of cars parked by the side of the building and drove up there to park the car while he investigated.

As Evan parked and got out of the car, he could see Fred by the back of the building; dragging a dead body by the neck, towards a dumpster.

 

Evan walked up to him. Fred was small but still managed to drag a 40-year-old man by the jaw. It looked strange; someone so small, dragging someone so big. Fred was clearly more capable than he showed. The man had his throat cut open, but there wasn’t a drop of blood wasted on the asphalt. Fred’s shirt, on the other hand, was bloodstained, and so were his hands.

“This is not an appropriate time,” said Evan. “You are putting us at risk.”

“I was hungry,” smiled Fred, showing his pearly white fangs.

“They will investigate this.”

“Do you want me to starve?”

“If you do, you die. Then you come back, correct?”

“So?”

“So,” Evan summarized. “If you always come back, no matter what you do, what does staying fed accomplish?”

“Nothing,” Fred clarified. “I like to not feel hungry.”

His feet hovered slightly over the ground as he lifted himself up. A couple of pebbles raced across the parking lot, pushed away by an invisible force. Fred held the man upright and unceremoniously tossed him into the dumpster; not making the slightest effort to push his legs down, leaving them hanging over the edge. Fred turned his back to Evan, heading back to the car. Evan grabbed him by the shoulder. The two of them exchanged a look, both of them ready to act at an instinct’s notice.

“Do not jeopardize this,” Evan growled. “There is much at stake.”

“Save those angry eyes for later,” Fred grinned. “I’ll pop ‘em like a hard-boiled egg.”

“Then *earn* them.”

Evan pushed him off. Fred let a chuckle slip as he skipped back to the car, looking more like a regular kid with every step. Evan turned his attention back to the dumpster, pushing down the dead man. He retrieved the man’s wallet, taking a couple of bills out and leaving the ID out in the open. At least the man’s family would be informed.

 

They got back in the car. Fred was fidgety. Energized. He took off his bloodstained shirt and wiped his face with it. Evan pulled out of the parking lot, getting back on the road. They were heading for the highway. Somewhere along the way, Fred tossed his shirt to the wind, leaving the window wide open. The wind rushed through, tossing his hair around.

“You are careless,” Evan said. “I do not understand.”

“Why is that such a bad thing?” Fred asked. “I care less. Careless. You know how many people would consider that a blessing?”

“You are putting us at risk. You should stop.”

“You sound like a worried parent. It doesn’t suit you.”

“Maybe you need parenting.”

“Who said I haven’t had parenting?” Fred scoffed. “I have a mother. Lives up in Alaska. Left the moment she turned.”

“Is she like you?”

“Oh, most definitely,” Fred nodded. “We were brought back together. My father had a bleeding heart, and it cost him.”

“What happened?”

“What happens to all bleeding hearts,” Fred smiled. “Someone comes along to have a great big sip.”

Fred looked out the window, absent-mindedly tapping his fingers on the glove box. Evan couldn’t see him in the rear-view mirror.

 

The radio spoke about a traffic disruption up ahead. There was some kind of accident, and they warned about a significant delay. A delay meant road workers, and possibly police.

“You have to wait in the trunk,” said Evan. “You look too suspicious.”

“I’m not getting in the trunk.”

“I have nothing for you to wear. They will ask questions.”

“Not my problem.”

“It will be when they take us into custody.”

“Don’t you remember, half-breed? I got time.”

Evan pulled over, slammed his foot on the break, and got out of the car. Before Fred could react, the passenger side door was flung wide open. Evan wasn’t holding back. There was a crack in his disguise, showing insectoid arms slipping through his chest, neck, and arms. A set of mandibles grew from the pit of his throat, unfolding out of his mouth. Two more sets of eyes opened along the sides of his skull, gleaming an animal yellow as they reflected the streetlights.

“*Get in the trunk*.”

Evan’s voice wasn’t coming from his mouth anymore, but some guttural membrane trying to mimic a human voice. Fred gleefully shrugged him off.

“Make me.”

 

Evan threw him away from the car, but it felt like throwing a balloon. Fred rolled in the gravel, then floated back up to his feet. He couldn’t stop laughing.

“That’s it? That’s what you’re gonna scare me with? I’m not afraid of spiders!”

“*I am not a spider.*”

A tendril shot out of Evan’s chest, wrapping around Fred’s arm like an outstretched slug. Fred came tumbling to the ground with a thud as he reached into his pocket, bringing out his knife. He made a quick cut along the edge of the tendril, just enough for him to peel back the skin like an impromptu scalping. Evan winced as he threw Fred straight up, expecting him to come tumbling down. Instead he hung about 9 feet into the air, seemingly weightless. The tendril retracted.

“Maybe I’ll wait here all night,” Fred chuckled. “Maybe I’ll keep you out here for days. Maybe you can’t do shit unless *I let you*.”

“*We had an arrangement. Honor it.*”

You think I give the slightest shit about some spineless nobody?!” Fred snapped back. “Why the hell would you go cross the country for someone so much weaker than you? For someone who constitutes nothing but a *burden?*”

Fred came down, his voice raised.

“It doesn’t make sense!” he continued. “What the hell do you have to gain from this? Who the hell is he to you?”

He took a few steps forward. Evan kept quiet, looking for an opening.

“Is he a half-brother? A lover? An *investment?*”

“*A friend*.”

Fred spat, poking a finger into Evan’s chest, surprised to find that there was no bone there. Instead, his hand was sucked into a cavity, pulling Fred in all the way to his shoulder like a macabre hug.

“You can’t be serious,” Fred chuckled. “You’re not driving cross-country for a buddy-buddy.”

“*Yes, I am*.”

“Bullshit.”

Evan dragged him all the way to the trunk, popped it open, and pushed him into it.

“*No*,” Evan said. “*Not bullshit*.”

“Then you’re an idiot.”

“*Fine*.”

He slammed the trunk shut, hearing Fred exhale in frustration. Evan adjusted himself, letting his exoskeleton settle into place. It was going to be a long night.

 

It didn’t take long for Evan to reach a complete halt in traffic. Six lanes had been reduced to three as traffic police redirected car, after car, after car. Even at this hour, the roads were packed. There was some kind of accident ahead. A muffled voice came from the trunk.

“Maybe I should pop this thing open and call for help?” Fred laughed. “Wouldn’t that be funny?”

“No.”

Evan kept his voice low and checked the rear-view mirror. There was a man in a truck behind him looking exceptionally tired.

“I think it’d be funny,” Fred sighed. “Don’t you ever laugh?”

“I laugh.”

“Really? Can you even smile?”

“I can smile.”

“Alright, let’s hear a joke then.”

The car moved along at a snail’s pace. They were gonna be there for a while. If Evan could say something to keep Fred from making a mess of things, he would.

“I can tell you a joke,” Evan said. “But then you have to comply.”

“Only if it makes me laugh.”

“Agreed.”

 

Evan turned down the radio and kept the car idling. The ones in front had already turned off their engine. Evan adjusted his voice and started talking.

“The other day I was standing in-“

“No. No no no,” Fred interrupted. “No memorized stand-up routines. A joke. Tell me a joke.”

“A Carlin routine is objectively better than a punchline.”

“I don’t care. Tell me a *joke*.”

It was the first time Evan had the instinct to roll his eyes. He didn’t, but he could see why people might. It was a sensation to tickle the nerves, to take focus away from the frustration. Evan unbuckled his seatbelt, letting his insides relax. They were still a little rearranged from their last clash.

“Why do melons not get married?” Evan asked.

There was a slight pause. Evan checked the rear-view mirror again. The man behind him had fully fallen asleep.

“Because,” he continued. “They cantaloupe.”

Fred snorted.

“That’s… no,” he said. “Elope is getting married in secret. The joke should be ‘why can’t melons get married in secret’.”

“I will consider that.”

“You should make it an anti-joke. Something like…”

Fred considered it and turned in the trunk, making himself comfortable.

“Why can’t melons get married?” he asked rhetorically. “Because it’s illegal in the state of Massachusetts.”

“We are not in Massachusetts,” Evan remarked.

“Then you and another melon are good to go.”

That got a snort out of Evan. That, in turn, got Fred going, and he started giggling in the trunk. Soon enough, both of them were quietly chuckling to themselves, as the line of cars slowly started to roll.

 

A couple of minutes stretched into an hour as they made their way through the jam. The sun was peeking over the horizon, and Evan could hear Fred zip himself up. By the time traffic was back on track, the orange glow of dawn was casting long shadows across the road.

It didn’t take long for Evan to notice something alarming. There were more patrolmen along the way. They weren’t checking people for speeding, so there had to be some other reason they were there. There was also a bit of a line coming up further down the road. Some people were getting pulled over.

A checkpoint.

There could be any number of issues. Maybe they had found Fred’s bloody shirt and connected it to some camera footage at the gas station. Maybe there was a witness. Maybe they’d seen them argue by the side of the road. Either way, something wasn’t right.

Evan took another look at the truck coming up from behind. He hadn’t paid much attention to the company logo, as he couldn’t see it from this angle. Adjusting his rear-view mirror, he noticed the image of a blue sunflower. Some kind of florist, at first glance.

There was no doubt in his mind; that was a Hatchet truck. They’d been followed for God knows how long.

 

A couple of patrol cars joined from behind, boxing him in. Two officers had stepped out into the road, holding up a stop sign and waving Evan over.

“Fred,” he said. “You have to get up.”

There was no response.

“Fred,” he tried again. “Get up. Now.”

There was no telling how deeply he slept, if he even slept at all. Evan was looking for options. He could tear them apart, hoping to get enough of them before he was perforated by bullets. But that would just put him on their radar. He needed to get out of there, and he needed to do it before they could figure out what he was doing.

But there was no way he could do it without leaving Fred. But he couldn’t do that either.

 

As the car came to a full stop, an officer knocked on the window.

“License and registration, please.”

Evan’s mind raced in a hundred directions. He was losing options by the second. Every delay was admission of guilt. He was confirming their suspicions. They were doubling down. He could see a man putting his hands on his service weapon. The truck behind him came to a full stop as the doors swung open, and boots hit the ground.

He would have to fight. Kill them all. And then there would be more, and more, and more, until they put him in a cell somewhere far away. It was only a matter of time. Exactly what his mother had tried to steer him away from – turning into a monster and getting himself captured.

There was another knock on the window as the officer stepped back with his gun drawn. But there was another sound, too.

A zipper, slowly opening. Fred whispered just loud enough for Evan to hear.

“Go.”

 

The trunk popped open.

The moment sunlight hit Fred, the air exploded with a thick black dust. It was like an artillery shell had hit the back of the car, making the front wheels bounce. The cloud stretched as people started to cough, and Evan hit the gas. The world smelled like burnt hair, and he could feel something acidic at the back of his throat. It wasn’t tear gas, but it wasn’t far off. There was a bump as Evan clipped the corner of a patrol vehicle, rushing past as the engine struggled to keep up. Someone fired a gun. Then another. There was a metallic clang as something hit the side of the car. Evan kept his foot on the gas.

The cloud expanded before suddenly dissipating. Evan was halfway off the road. He couldn’t stop, it was too late. He’d never had to do this kind of stunt driving before. The car rolled right off the road, down a bank, and slammed straight into an oak; sending Evan crashing through the front window.

Turns out, he’d forgotten to re-buckle his seatbelt.

He unfurled his wings, getting a launching start that sent him flying across an open cornfield and far, far away from his would-be captors. By the time they spotted him on the horizon, not even their bullets could reach him.

 

It was late in the afternoon when Evan landed. He followed the small roads and kept to the shadows. He passed a sign welcoming him to the state of Oklahoma, on foot. If this was the right way, at least he had narrowed the search area a little. Even if it cost him his guide, he was making headway. At least, that’s what he tried telling himself. Chances were, he was about as lost as when he started. In fact, Fred might have tricked him from the start. There were no guarantees.

By nightfall, Evan was having second thoughts. He found an abandoned bus stop with a wobbly bench. He sat down, considering his options. Had he made the right call? If he’d stayed and fought, maybe they both could’ve gotten away. Then again, maybe neither of them had. Maybe, just maybe, it was pointless to argue about coulda woulda shoulda.

He had to press forward. And he would. He just had to sit for a while.

 

Someone sat down next to him.

Evan turned his head to see a small, smoldering corpse. Twig-sized arms burned to the point where he could see the space between the bones in the forearms. The head was little more than a flesh-covered skull, the eyes burned out of their sockets. Teeth peeled back into a death’s-head grin. He was still smoldering, resembling a roast more than a person. Evan paused, letting the sensation sink in.

“You made it.”

“No,” Fred wheezed. “I came back.”

“You look unwell.”

“I am, thank you.”

They sat there in silence, letting the birds serenade them a little longer. The wind was almost pleasant, and the cloud cover was letting up. Evan could spot the constellations.

“He’s close,” Fred continued. “Half an hour southwest. Big open space. Like a quarry, or an airfield.”

“Are you sure?”

“Fuck you.”

 

Evan turned his attention to the road. He could make it southwest on his own, he wouldn’t have to drag Fred along.

“I suppose you want your payment,” Evan said.

“I don’t care,” Fred scoffed.

He picked a piece of meat out of the corner of his exposed teeth and flicked it across the road. He didn’t seem to be in pain, despite having no skin to cover his innards. Evan could see spots of blood dripping onto the bench.

“What changed your mind?” he asked.

“Bleeding hearts get what’s coming to them sooner or later,” Fred mumbled. “Besides, I like a good road trip.”

“You consider this a good road trip.”

Fred shrugged, making his charred skin crack, revealing a pinkish streak.

“Had better. Had worse.”

 

Evan turned to Fred, looking into his empty sockets.

“So what is your deal?” he asked. “Why the blood? The sunlight?”

“I’m a spooky vampire,” Fred spat. “Can’t you tell?”

“There are no vampires.”

“You just take the fun out of everything.”

“That is not my intention.”

“Whatever.”

Evan turned his attention back to the road. Fred tried to dust off a piece of fabric but ended up dislocating two of his exposed fingers. He pushed them back into place.

“It’s a balance thing,” he said. “If I can’t die, others have to die in my place. Hence, blood. If I could be up and about all the time, I’d kill too much, so the sunlight thing holds me back.”

“Did your father ask for that?”

“He asked for me and mom to be given a fair chance. I guess the thing didn’t know what to make of that.”

“That is unfortunate.”

“That’s one word for it.”

 

Fred got up from his bench, scratching his head. A piece of his cranium exposed itself, gleaming and white.

“Good luck, half-breed.”

“Be careful.”

“Thanks, *dad*.”

Fred snorted and turned his back on him, walking off into the woods. He drifted past branches and leaves, joining the effortless wind.

 

By morning, Evan had his sight on the Oklahoma Pit; a Hatchet-run facility built on an abandoned marble quarry. The place was enormous. He counted sniper towers, roaming patrols, and supply trucks coming in and out of triple checkpoints.

But this, he could work with. Now he had a singular place to focus his attention.

Perry was in there.

And there wasn’t an obstacle on God’s green Earth that could keep him from tearing that place apart.",1,1761351811.0,Saturdead,0,1.0,False
1ofds5z,https://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/1ofds5z/my_first_day_off_after_any_number_of_shifts_is/,My first day off after any number of shifts is absolute garbage,"Hi guys, I am newly working in the ED, day shift. I have ADHD if that adds context, and am fully medicated. I try my absolute best to set myself up for success my first day off (got a huge bottle of liquid IV water in my bed with me, etc!) but regardless of what I do I feel like absolute GARBAGE, all day. Maybe I’m just weak? I’m not really looking for advice so much as solidarity, because it always seems like my friends and coworkers admit that they’re a little tired but otherwise seem to have a normal and happy day off. Me on the other hand, even the day after just ONE shift I am spending 7 hours just to get out of bed, make my coffee, eat a bit of food…mixed in with just needing to lay down and go on my phone again. My head is full of cotton balls, I’m grumpy, I maybe get a walk in and wash a few dishes if I’m lucky, but am otherwise out of commission for a full day.


I don’t know if it’s because I’m using every scrap of energy I have to mask socially while keep a rapidly changing and growing task list in my head for 12+ hours, on my feet all day, remembering to cross all my t’s in the chart, etc. 


I think I’d feel 100% better about this if this was an acknowledged phenomenon, like if the price of packing in so much work into a small amount of days does mean that I’ll have to sacrifice a day or two to “recovery” rather than spreading the work out more mildly into 5 days with a 9-5. I feel like even though I work only 3 days, I still only have 2 good productive days to socialize and feel like myself. 


Is there anyone else in the same boat? Do you guys think this is “okay”? I’ve spent so much of my life trying to fix myself with vitamins and yoga and self-care, doctors appointments to figure out if I have some deficiency… but really, I think I’m looking for validation that I’m okay, and don’t have to despair hearing all the productive happy people outside my window on a Saturday and hate myself for being so bad at life.

I have a lovely little coffee plant that I adore, about a week and a half ago I up-potted it (into an appropriately sized pot for the root ball) - and in that time the soil has barely dried out at all. All the leaves are drooping, and the lower leaves are starting to yellow. I already cut off the worst of the yellowing leaves, but I can't seem to save the ones above it. I have it under some grow lights, and a few days ago I introduced a fan to help dry the soil a little faster. Will my beautiful girl bounce back?

I have a BA in Social Sciences in my home country, but I never really used it. I have always worked as an Admin Assistant and later Coordinator for over 7 years.

Anyways I recently around 9 months ago I finally landed a Admin Assistant position in Canada, but I am having mixed feelings about it. In this type of jobs back home I was used to doing basic AA stuff: booking meetings, office inventory, event coordination, but also included some AP, AR, EA duties. Maybe 50/50 of each.

But this current job feels like I am doing a bunch of maintenance office duties that no one wants to do. Like less than 30% is AA related: office supplies, phone duties/general inbox monitoring and and classifying invoices in SAP. This probably takes me less than 8 hours a week. Rest of the time I am watering/pruning plants, fixing our coffee machine (literally taking it apart to clean it, because people don’t do it an it jams) taking cardboard to the recycling center, some kitchen cleaning, cleaning off after events. The other day they decided to replace all office desktops and it was me doing it by myself one by one. I spent whole two days doing that and then next day folding all the cardboard for recycling.

I guess my question is, is this normal AA duties in Canada? I just feel like this jobs is too manual, some days am barely at my desk. I have not quit just because I need the job experience, but I also feel like I am really not learning anything.

I need to get this off my chest because I think I'm losing my mind, or something truly terrible is happening to me.

Three nights ago, I was woken up by a scream. Not your usual drunk shouting or a neighbor's argument. It was a blood-curdling, animalistic shriek, filled with such pure, undiluted terror that the blood in my veins ran cold. It sounded exactly at 4:00 AM, according to the clock on my nightstand. It lasted maybe three seconds, and then cut off so abruptly, it was as if a knife had been put to the screamer's throat.

I jumped up and ran to the window. The street was empty. Not a soul. Just the yellow glow of the streetlights and the rustle of leaves. I thought maybe I had imagined it. I told myself—a dream, a nightmare. I went back to bed but couldn't fall asleep again.

Last night, it happened again. Again, 4:00 AM. The same scream. The same voice. Male? Female? Hard to tell. It was just... fear. I jumped to the window again. Still no one. But this time, I thought I saw something move in the shadows under the tree across the street. Something low and dark, like a person crouching, but the outlines were... wrong.

Tonight. I didn't sleep. I sat by the window with a mug of cold coffee and waited. The clock on my phone showed 3:59 AM. My heart was pounding like crazy. The air in the room became thick and heavy.

And then I heard not a scream, but another sound. A quiet, barely audible scraping on the asphalt right under my first-floor window. I froze, afraid to breathe. Through the blinds, I saw it.

It was shaped like a person, but its movements were contorted, angular, like a spider's. Its long, bony limbs bent unnaturally. It was slowly crawling along the sidewalk, its head thrown back, and its mouth wide open.

And from that mouth... poured that same scream. The same shriek of terror I'd heard for the past two nights.

But this creature wasn't screaming from fear. It was emanating it. It was the source.

It crawled down the street, and this sound erupted from it like radiation, infecting everything around with a wave of panic. It wasn't attacking. It was just... broadcasting horror. Like a siren announcing the end of the world, an apocalypse that had come for you alone.

It crawled past my window, and its empty eye sockets paused on me for a second. The scream didn't stop. It vibrated in my bones, hammering a single impulse into my brain: ""RUN HIDE DIE.""

And then it crawled on. The scream began to fade, dissolving into the night until it was completely gone.

It's 4:12 AM now. I flinch at every little sound I hear from the street. I'm afraid to look out the window. But most of all, I'm afraid that in a few minutes, it will be 4:00 AM again.

And I will hear that scream once more. But this time, much, much closer.",4,1761351496.0,Ghoststories,0,1.0,False

Basically I'm a big supporter of places like Bitty & Beau's and other businesses that give folks with special needs employment, and I'm a huge fan of ""The Restaurant of Forgotten Orders"" which primarily employs the elderly who have dementia. This is kind of my big soft spot.

I used to go to a McDonald's in the U District regularly because this fellow with Down's named Jason would always greet me with this huge genuine smile and if he wasn't too busy with his duties he'd stop by and chat with me while I had my breakfast. Just a beam of positive energy radiated off of this guy and it would honestly sometimes make my whole day better. I don't live in the UD anymore and with me being a public transportation rider it's a bit of a journey to go there in the morning to grab coffee and a biscuit.

Are there any places that I can support that give people with special needs employment and treat them with dignity that you guys know of? Thanks in advance!",11,1761351337.0,Seattle,8,1.0,False

1ofdmnq,https://www.reddit.com/r/TinyHouses/comments/1ofdmnq/tiny_home_land_for_sale_in_ny/,Tiny home land for sale in NY,"My wife and I recently moved our tiny home from NY down to NC. As a result, the property in NY is now for sale. Please don’t contact me directly since I have a realtor. He can be contacted through the listing link below for any questions or to arrange a showing. 

It’s 3.75 acres in the Catskills. All major utilities (well, septic, electrical (2x 50amp outlets)) and a 40’ concrete pad are already there. For internet we used starlink and it worked perfectly. So you can literally drive the tiny home there and start enjoying it. There are no zoning regulations in this town, so before I bought the land, I contacted the town’s building inspector and he confirmed that RVs/tiny homes can be parked on the property permanently. Legally you can only occupy them up to 6 months at a time. Reality is there are very few houses on the (unpaved) road and it’s very hidden away. We used the place as a vacation home, but in the last two years it was booked every weekend through airbnb. No one ever bothered us or our guests. Permits to operate the Airbnb were easy to obtain and we operated everything 100% legally, if that’s the route you want to take. Personally I could have always imagined living there, but it was a little too remote for my wife. 

Closest supermarket and a few restaurants/coffee shops are 15min away. The next big town which has stores like Walmart, Home Depot, etc. Is Oneonta. About 40min away. 

We used to live in CT so managing the airbnb and enjoying it on rare occasions ourselves was much easier. We moved to NC a few months ago and are simply to far away now. That’s the reason why we are selling it.

It pressed through the screens, coated the floorboards, slept in the walls. On good nights the city sang. On bad nights it hissed. That Tuesday sat somewhere in between.

I sat at the small table by the window and worked through algebra. The numbers blurred. A ferry horn drifted up the canal. The lamp hummed. A levee drone clicked past in a slow patrol, its red eye washing our ceiling in a thin stripe. Mama’s note sat under the salt shaker, folded twice.

Back late. Eat. Lock the door. Love you.

I read the words again and slid the note into my pocket. Habit. I liked the weight of her handwriting close to me. A man shouted two blocks over. Laughter answered him. The rain eased, then returned. The lights on the tramline flickered and held.

Our building stood on stilts near the old industrial canal. The lower ring. The folks above us had a steel balcony and a view. We had a skinny slice of water and a string of tin planters that I kept alive. Mint. Basil. Two peppers. The insects loved those leaves. I didn’t mind. They belonged to this place as much as we did.

I moved a sheet of paper and a line of ants changed direction underneath. Not the first time I’d seen them. Streets and kitchens in this city held more life than any map, and the small things found a way. Still, something in their path looked too straight, like a line drawn with a ruler.

I watched. The line split. Two columns wove around a dried smear of sauce and met again on the far side. No hesitation. No stumble. Perfect timing, like a drum section in a second-line. I told myself it was instinct and went back to the worksheet.

Five minutes later the old fridge clicked off and the room fell quiet. No hum from the patrol drone outside. No ferry horn. No voices. The rain softened to a hush. I heard my own breath and the soft rub of legs inside the wall.

“Help us.”

I looked up. No one stood at the door. No one stood in the hallway. The sound hadn’t crossed the air. It had risen from the floor itself.

I held still. Sweat rolled from my neck into my shirt. My hands felt too large and too clumsy for the pencil they held. I set it down. I lowered my head until my hair nearly touched the table.

“Help us,” it said again.

No mouth made that sound. It arrived as pressure. A small knock from inside bone. I slid out the chair and went to my knees. I lifted the tablecloth and peered into the dim space under the table.

Ants moved across the cracked tile. Not in a scatter. In a shape. A ring opened. Words formed. The letters were careful. The spacing made sense.

Listen.

I didn’t speak. I pressed my palms to the floor. A faint thrum rose from the wood. The thrum turned into a rhythm. The rhythm formed meaning. The meaning slid into my head as if it had waited for years to find a door.

I didn’t run. I didn’t call for Mama. I stayed where I was and kept my breath slow. The ants moved in coordinated arcs. A roach eased from the seam by the baseboard and held still, as if waiting for a part in a play. A moth knocked once at the screen and stayed.

I whispered, “Who are you?”

The answer broke into my chest, then settled. Not a voice. A pattern. A sense of many minds holding one thought.

We are here.

“Why me?”

You hear. You answer.

I swallowed. The room felt lighter and heavier at once. I pushed one finger along the tile in a small sweep. The line of ants parted before it, then flowed back into place the moment my finger passed. No panic. No break. I drew a triangle. They filled its edges. I erased two corners with my nail. They drew those corners again.

I sat back on my heels and laughed once under my breath because it kept fear from cracking open. The moth at the screen fluttered and rested. The roach turned toward me and held position like a sentinel.

“What do you need?”

Safe. Food. Path.

I slid my empty plate to the edge and tapped twice on a small crumb beside it. The ants received the signal as if they’d waited. Two ranks moved to the crumb, lifted it, and took it into the wall seam.

I watched them disappear. Calm spread through me like heat after cold rain. I nodded before I realized I’d done it.

“Okay.”

The fridge clicked back on. The drone outside resumed its patrol. A car splashed through a puddle on the street. A woman laughed from a balcony. The world lifted the cover it had thrown over us for a minute and behaved like a city again.

I stood and washed the plate. I checked the window locks. I blew out the lamp. I lay on the couch with my book and didn’t read a page. Every few breaths, with my eyes closed, I felt them under the floor. The rhythm slowed and softened, like the tide under a pier.

I slept. The dreams came.

White light. Glass. A cold ring around a wrist that was hardly a wrist. A face above, mouth moving, words sealed behind glass. A flood of bodies like smoke, like a sky of crawling stars. The sense of a world holding its breath and then breathing as one. A door opening. Arms lifting. Red light moving past in circles.

I woke with my heart pounding in the dark. The rain had stopped. The city had gone soft again. I sat up and pressed my hand to the floor.

We are here.

I nodded into the empty room. I didn’t try to pretend it was a dream.

At six the next morning I made coffee for Mama and left it sweet on the counter the way she liked it. I folded her note and put it back under the salt shaker for later. The tramline lights burned pale in the fog. Barge horns reached us from the river. Mama came in near sunrise, hair wet from drizzle, jacket dark at the shoulders.

“Morning, Eli.” She kissed my head and breathed in the coffee steam. “You sleep okay?”

“Yeah.”

“You eat?”

“After school.”

“You need shoes that don’t leak.”

“I know.”

She looked at me as if she might ask more, then let it go. She worked the night watch at a care facility two stops away. Half her face smiled with ease. The other half held the kind of fatigue that made smiles heavy. She touched the tin planters and frowned at the holes in the basil leaves.

“Little thieves,” she said.

“They earn their keep.”

She took her mug to the window and watched a patrol drone sweep the canal. “Saints preserve us, even the insects’ve got friends now.”

“They had friends before we did.”

She laughed. “Breakfast.”

We ate rice and eggs and sat quiet for a minute. I watched her breathe. She watched the waterline on the bulkhead where the last flood had sat for a week. We never painted over it. It kept us honest.

“Tell me if school gets rough,” she said.

“It’ll be fine.”

“If anyone touches you.”

“It’ll be fine.”

She held my gaze another second, then set her mug down. “I know you hear more than you say. Just remember to talk sometimes.”

“I hear you.”

“Good.”

She kissed the top of my head again and went to bed. I locked the door. I packed the algebra book and a rain shell and a sandwich. The corridor smelled like bleach and mud. I took the tram to school with a handful of kids from the lower ring. We rode past the new towers across the river, their mirrored faces catching a sun we couldn’t see. A barge pushed through the Ship Channel and sent a small tide into the side canals. A row of houses on stilts leaned into one another like old men at a parade.

School sat on higher ground that once held a ball field. The new levee ran a block behind it, thick with bio-concrete and quiet pumps. The guard at the door nodded me through. A boy from my class elbowed me once in the hallway and called me Swamp Rat when he thought the teacher didn’t hear. I let it slide. He needed the attention more than I needed the trouble.

Math passed. History passed. I watched a spider drop from a fire sprinkler head on a thin line and climb back up. I knew without looking that two ants in the corner would meet in twelve seconds and tap antennae twice, then go their separate ways.

At lunch I sat alone on the back steps where the fence caught the wind from the marsh. The sky broke into strips of blue and cloud. Gulls screamed over the canal. I finished half the sandwich and wrapped the rest for later. A cockroach climbed my shoe and paused as if waiting for news.

I pressed a finger to the step. The faint thrum answered from under the concrete. Not words now. Presence.

“We’re fine,” I said under my breath.

The roach moved off. A gull landed on the fence post and stared at me like I owed it money. I flicked the last crumb into the grass. The gull took it and left. The bell rang. I went back in.

The day stretched across the wet light and turned toward evening. I rode the tram home with a girl who read poetry into her sleeve and a man who slept with a paper bag under his arm. The tram eased past a memorial wall where names ran like water from one end to the other. Fresh flowers leaned in jars. A small boy pressed his hand to a name that fit his palm.

I stepped off at our stop and walked the last block in the damp heat. The canal lay flat as glass. A gar surfaced and took air like a sigh, then vanished. I let myself in, set my bag down, and watered the plants.

The first whisper came before the lamp warmed.

Danger.

I froze. The ants under the table shaped a warning line, then broke it and shaped it again, faster. The roach in the seam backed into darkness. The moth at the screen tapped twice, then once.

“What is it?”

They answered as pressure. A long wave moving toward us. The kind a body feels before a storm breaks. Electricity tasted like metal at the back of my tongue.

I turned off the lamp. The apartment held its breath. Streetlight reached through the blinds in thin bands. Rain began in bright needles. A motor thrummed near the canal and cut. Footsteps on metal. A radio whisper. The soft static of a rifle charge.

I knelt at the window and peeled the blind a finger’s width. Four black vans idled at the corner. Men in armor stepped out. Visors down. Rifles held flat across their chests. They moved in a line that left no gaps.

My throat went dry. The swarm pressed in behind my eyes as if it needed to see through me.

“Why?” I whispered.

Target. Locate. Take.

The words dropped into my skull like stones. I choked them down and stood.

The first knock on our door was gentle. The second wasn’t.

“Open,” a voice said. Calm. Trained.

I stepped backward and held my breath. My heart beat inside my palms. I set both hands on the floor and let the countless small hearts under the wood count with mine.

Ready, they said.

The third blow split the frame. The lock bent. The door cracked at the top hinge. The window above the sink rattled and then shattered inward with a shot from the alley. Glass hit the counter and the floor. The lamp fell and broke.

“Target located,” someone said from the hall. Closer now. “Capture alive.”

A shape crossed the threshold. Armor. Visor. Blue glow at the weapon’s throat. Rain struck the man’s shoulder and ran in bright lines.

I didn’t think. I felt the need like heat. Leave.

The swarm moved in one surge. Ants poured from the outlets and the seams. Roaches erupted from the baseboards. Wasps lifted from the window frame in a hard storm of wings. The first man lifted his weapon and flinched as the wasps struck his visor. The roaches swarmed the weapon’s joints. Ants found the cracked outlet and made a bridge that turned bright and burned. Sparks spat across the man’s gloves. He fell back a step and cursed. The second man raised his rifle and lost the grip when beetles hit the guard from all sides.

More boots filled the hall. A bright pulse rolled through the apartment and burned the air. The swarm staggered and then knit itself again. I slid along the wall toward the fire escape as the kitchen window blew wide a second time. Rain screamed through the frame and hit the far wall.

I climbed onto the sink and swung a leg through broken glass. A shard cut my thigh. I didn’t stop. The swarm followed in a dark ribbon. The men shouted. Someone fired into the ceiling to push me down. The shot punched a fist-sized hole above the pantry door. Plaster snowed onto the floor.

“Hands,” a voice ordered.

“No,” I said, and didn’t recognize the sound as mine.

I dropped to the escape and ran. The metal shook under my steps. Water turned the rungs to soap. I moved anyway. The swarm made two streams. One shielded my face. One struck behind me. A man leaned out our doorway and lifted his weapon. Wasps hit his wrist. He flinched and fired blind. The round ate a chunk out of brick two feet to my left.

I reached the alley and ran for the canal. A floodlight on a mast lit the water like a pale road. Sirens rose three blocks away. The patrol drone swept past and then cut west as if it had found a more important problem.

The swarm guided me with taps inside my chest. Left at the dumpster. Under the fence where the mesh had failed near the post. Across the service lane. Over a wall where the mortar had gone soft. I trusted the signals and kept moving. My lungs burned. My thigh bled into warm rain. My teeth hurt from clenching.

I hit the levee path and slid. Mud swallowed my shoes. The floodwall rose to my shoulder. I followed it toward the marsh. The city lights fell behind me like a line of candles snuffed by a slow hand.

I looked back once from the shadow of the pump station. Men moved in our alley, their lights cutting white holes in the rain. One raised a hand and pointed toward the canal. Another spoke into a throat mic. A third looked at the water the way a man looks at a place he doesn’t want to enter.

The swarm pushed me on.

We left concrete. We entered grass higher than my knees. The blades brushed my hands and poured water down my wrists. Frogs cried in the ditches. Mosquitoes rose in a cloud and then parted around my head. I reached the first cypress stand as thunder rolled across the river.

The last streetlight on the service road went out behind me. Only the sky kept its pale skin. The swamp opened. Black pools. Thin islands. Fallen trunks like ribs under moss.

Stop, the swarm said.

I stopped under a bent tree and dropped to a knee. Breath tore at my throat. My hands shook so hard I pressed them into the mud to steady them. I waited for footsteps. I heard none. The rain softened again the way it does in this city, as if it were a curtain and someone had stepped behind it.

We made a circle around me. Ants claimed the root tangle under my feet. Beetles arranged along the trunk in a neat column. Two wasps perched on a leaf by my cheek and didn’t move.

Safe, they said.

“Here,” I whispered back.

I sat with my back against the tree and felt the heat leave my skin. Lightning crawled along the horizon. The pump station ticked once and fell quiet. A rail car clanked far away. I pictured Mama coming home to a door half off its hinge and a room gutted by an order I didn’t understand. My stomach turned. My jaw hurt. I told myself to stand and go back, but the swarm held me like a patient hand on a shoulder.

Not yet, they said. They didn’t feel fear. They felt purpose.

I looked into the water. Ghost lines moved under the surface. Minnows. Larvae. Thin streams of debris. Everything alive found a current and joined it. I pressed my palm to the bark and let the small heartbeats in the wood line up with my own.

The men didn’t follow us into the swamp. Their orders stopped at the edge. Ours began inside.

I watched the dark for a long time and let breath settle. The blood on my thigh dried tacky. A heron lifted from the far bank and moved through the rain with no sound at all. I thought of the white room from my dream. I thought of the way the many bodies had formed one roof in a corridor I didn’t remember walking. I thought of the word we.

“Thank you,” I said.

We are here, they said again, and this time the words felt less like a message and more like a truth the whole place agreed to.

The rain ended. A breeze came up from the south and pushed the clouds toward the lake. I stood and tested my leg. It held. I took a step along the root spine, then another. The insects flowed ahead in a thin ribbon, always leaving a space for my foot where the mud wouldn’t swallow me whole.

“Show me a place to sleep,” I said.

They did.

In my past life, I was obsessed with his tender care, mistaking his inappropriate attention for love.


So when he brought Chloe Johnson home and announced their engagement, I lost it—screaming, confronting him, making such a scene that all of Boston knew.


All I got was him calling me ""ungrateful"", then two weeks later, I was sent to a psych ward, tortured to death by electroshock therapy.


The day after my funeral, he threw Chloe the most extravagant wedding.


Just like that, I became the century scandal—the so-called ungrateful girl who dared to seduce her own adoptive father.


But now I'm back. Back to the exact day I first asked him:


""Can we be more than just... father and daughter?""


The man sitting across from me was peeling shrimp, his hands freezing mid-motion:


""What did you say?""


Last time, I missed the flash of disgust in his eyes. I'd cried and repeated those pathetic words like some lovesick idiot.


But hearing those words again now, I can almost smell the sickening scent of my own flesh burning during the electroshock sessions.


I shudder violently, forcing a smile:


""Dad, didn't you say I need to learn to be independent? I can peel my own shrimp. Don't trouble yourself.""


This time? I'm NOT making the same mistake.


Ryan's fingers froze mid-air.


Eight years—and this was the first time I'd ever pulled away from him.


The silence stretched for several seconds before he lowered his head, continuing to peel the shrimp, voice dropping low:


""Let me do it. Don't want you getting your hands dirty.""


He'd said the exact same thing in my past life.


Back then, I'd been over the moon—thought it was proof I was special. But living through this twice, I finally got it: it was just a guardian looking after his ward. Nothing more.


I took the shrimp straight from his hands, tone flat:


""No need. I'll have to get married eventually—might as well learn to do things myself.""


""Married?""


Ryan's voice dropped several degrees colder. ""You're only twenty.""


""Twenty isn't that young."" I kept my eyes down, focused on peeling.


""Besides, didn't you say you hoped I'd settle down soon? Stop... clinging to you all the time?""


Those were his exact words from my past life—the day he brought Chloe Johnson home.


I'd sobbed until I couldn't breathe. Now, saying them myself, I felt... nothing. Just calm.


The table fell silent again, only the faint clink of porcelain filling the air.


I finished my meal in silence, standing up: ""I'm done. Take your time.""


The second I turned away, a chair screeched violently behind me.


I didn't look back.


---


Back in my room, I leaned against the door, completely drained. Pretending not to care was exhausting.


I scanned the space. My nightstand was stacked with fairy tale books—ones he'd read to me every night when I was little, his voice lulling me to sleep.


The window seat was crowded with stuffed animals and trinkets from every country he'd ever traveled to.


On my desk sat last year's birthday gift—a diamond necklace.


I remembered that day so clearly. He'd clasped it around my neck himself, smiling: ""Our Lena's all grown up now. Time for her to have real jewelry.""


I'd thought it meant something. That I meant something.


In my past life, I wore that necklace the day I confronted him. He'd ripped it off my neck in front of everyone and thrown it in the trash.


*""Lena, don't be so fucking ungrateful.""*


A sharp pain twisted through my chest.


I grabbed an empty box and started packing. Every item was a memory. Every item was a dull knife dragging across my heart.


Storybooks, stuffed animals, birthday gifts, photos... all of it went into the box, shoved to the bottom of my closet.


Out of sight, out of mind.


I was still packing when there was a knock at the door.


""Lena? You still awake?""


Ryan's voice.


""Yeah. What's up, Dad?""


The door opened. He was holding a glass of warm milk.


""Drink this before bed. Sleep well.""


Eight years. Same routine. Every single night, he'd brought me warm milk before I slept.


I took the glass but didn't act cute or beg him to stay like I used to.


""Thanks, Dad. You should get some rest too.""


Ryan stood there, like he was waiting for something.


After a long moment, he finally turned and left.


Just before the door closed, I saw him hesitate—like he wanted to say something.


He didn't.


I stared at the glass of milk in my hand, walked into the bathroom, and poured it straight down the drain.


Chapter 2


The next morning, I was woken by voices drifting up from downstairs.


When I came down, Chloe Johnson was already seated at the dining table, all smiles:


""Lena! Come have breakfast.""


This woman—the one who got me committed to a psych ward in my past life—married Ryan the day after my funeral and became the envied Mrs. Howard.


I swallowed the hatred and nodded coolly. ""Thanks.""


A few bites in, Chloe spoke up:


""Lena, I have a friend whose son is quite the catch. How about I set up a meeting between you two?""


Here we go.


Same timing as my past life. Back then, she'd used the blind date as an excuse to get rid of me. I'd cried and screamed that I'd rather die than leave Ryan.


He'd looked disgusted and called me immature.


This time, I agreed immediately:


""Sure. That'd be great, thanks.""


The second the words left my mouth, Ryan set down his coffee cup, brow furrowed:


""There's no rush. You're still young. I can take care of you for a few more years.""


""No need,"" I dabbed my mouth with a napkin. ""I'll have to get married eventually. Might as well do it sooner—give you some peace and quiet.""


The words ""peace and quiet"" made Ryan's expression darken completely.


Before he could respond, Chloe leaned in, looping her arm through his:


""Ryan, don't you trust my judgment? I wouldn't set her up with just anyone.""


Watching them like this—so cozy, so intimate—I waited for the pain to tear through me like it did before.


It didn't come.


Maybe because my heart had already burned to ash under all those electroshock sessions.


I stood. ""I'm finished. Just let me know when it's scheduled.""


As I headed upstairs, I heard Ryan's low voice behind me:


""Is she... mad at me?""


Chloe laughed softly. ""Ryan, you're overthinking it. Lena's just growing up, that's all.""


Growing up.


God, the irony.


Last life, he said I was immature and had me institutionalized.


This life, I was mature—and suddenly he was uncomfortable with it.


Three days later, the blind date arrived as planned.


The moment I saw him, I froze.


Because the man sitting across from me was famous.


Christian Lynch—head of Lynch Enterprises. Rumor had it he was cold, ruthless, still unmarried at thirty, and every socialite in Boston was dying to land him.


I never expected Chloe could actually arrange a meeting with him.


""Hi. I'm Lena Howard."" I extended my hand.


He nodded once, voice cool: ""Christian Lynch.""


After the briefest of pleasantries, he cut straight to it:


""I'm only here for one reason—marriage.""


""My grandmother is gravely ill. Her dying wish is to see me settle down.""


""I want the wedding done within a week.""


""If you have conditions, name them.""


Well. That was refreshingly blunt.


I thought back to the past eight years—everything Ryan had spent on me. Food, clothes, education, opportunities. Conservative estimate? Tens of millions.


If I was going to cut ties completely, I needed to settle the debt.


""A hundred million. As a wedding gift.""


Christian didn't even blink. ""Done.""


""The courthouse is still open. Let's go get the license now.""


One hour later.


I was married to a man I'd just met.


Standing outside the courthouse, staring at the marriage certificate in my hands, it all felt surreal.


""I'll pick you up in a week. The funds will transfer today.""


Christian turned, got in his car, and drove off without another word.


My phone buzzed.


[Account: +$100,000,000.00]


One hundred million. Just like that.


I stared at the number on my screen, and my eyes started to sting.


After all these years... I could finally pay him back.


When I got home, Chloe was in the living room, looking pissed.


The second she saw me, she rushed over:


""Lena! What the hell? You agreed to the blind date—why did you stand him up?""


I blinked. ""I didn't. I went.""


""You went? Then why is Charles Miller saying you never showed?"" Her voice sharpened.


Wait—Charles Miller?


So she hadn't set me up with Christian Lynch?


Then how did—


Oh.


We'd gone to the wrong table.


But honestly? Whatever. A hundred million in my account said it worked out just fine.


""Must've mixed up the location,"" I said breezily.


Chloe was about to go off again when Ryan emerged from his study, expression stormy:


""If you make a commitment, you keep it. Reschedule.""


Chloe's eyes lit up. ""Actually—the Lynches are hosting a gala tonight. We could bring Lena and introduce her to Lucas Lynch.""


Lucas Lynch—Christian's younger brother. Boston's most notorious playboy. A walking scandal in a tailored suit.


Ryan frowned. ""Lucas?""


""Ryan, I'm just being realistic."" Chloe sighed dramatically. ""After everything Lena's... reputation has been through, marrying into the Lynch family at all would be a blessing.""


She said it like I was damaged goods.


What the hell had I ever done?


Ryan was silent for a long moment. Then he nodded. ""Fine. We'll all go.""


I lowered my gaze, smiling bitterly to myself.


So that was what I was to him now. Only good enough for the family disgrace.


""I'm not going.""


I lifted my head, tone even. ""And don't bother calling me for dinner.""


I turned and headed upstairs.


Behind me, Chloe's voice turned syrupy:


""Ryan, she's sulking again...""


""Let her.""


Ryan's voice was flat. Unreadable.


SLAM.


I shut my bedroom door, leaned back against it, and closed my eyes.


Ryan Howard—whoever you loved, whoever you married this time around?


I didn't give a damn anymore.


Chapter 3


Half asleep, half awake, someone gently drew me into their arms.


A hand patted my shoulder softly while a voice murmured an indistinct bedtime story.


Suddenly, a warm sensation pressed against my lips. I jolted awake. Ryan—how long had it been since he'd come to my room?


Before I could process what was happening, Ryan's voice came out hoarse: ""Chloe...""


In that moment, my whole body went rigid.


I struggled to push him away, but he pressed closer in irritation, kissing me harder.


His hand moved lower, wandering across my body.


""Ryan, look at me clearly. I'm Lena.""


Hearing my name, his body jerked and he stopped.


He rubbed his brow, about to get up.


Then Chloe suddenly burst in. ""Ryan, how could you do this?""


""Tell me you weren't willing. Tell me.""


""Lena seduced you, didn't she?""


Ryan's brow furrowed slightly. ""I was drunk. I mistook her for you.""


""I'll find Lena another place to live. Then this won't happen again.""


Only then did Chloe nod, coming over to take Ryan's arm.


""Let me help you.""


I watched their figures leave together, then looked down at the marks on my neck.


How absurd.


I didn't sleep all night. Early the next morning, Chloe knocked on my door.


""Lena, until we find you a place, Ryan and I will stay outside first.""


As she spoke, she caught sight of the marks on my neck and leaned close to whisper in my ear:


""You'd better give up those filthy thoughts about Ryan, or else...""


""What are you two doing?""


Ryan suddenly appeared. Chloe immediately linked her arm through mine.


""Ryan, I was just telling Lena about us staying out.""


""I'm still a bit worried about her being home alone.""


""She's old enough. What's the problem?""


When Ryan first brought me home years ago, I'd been terrified—terrified of being abandoned again. I used to hide under my covers crying at night.


He'd stayed with me then, even canceling hundred-million-dollar deals just to come home and coax me to sleep.


But ever since he discovered my feelings, he'd grown more and more distant.


I smiled bitterly at myself.


""Actually, you don't need to go to that trouble. This was always Dad's house anyway.""


""I'll find a place and move out soon. All these years, thanks for taking care of me.""


""I can't keep troubling you forever.""


The word ""Dad"" hadn't passed my lips in years.


Hearing it, something dimmed in Ryan's eyes for a moment.


Suddenly, Ryan's phone rang.


After answering, he looked at me with anger in his eyes.


""What the hell have you done?""

The Moon recently drained a sky of its light, casts a shadow over Sarah. Sarah Rivers feathers an anxious tussle as she’s meeting a passive decision she’s been avoiding all day. To turn back home, on Mary Lane, the wet road, a bode of caution, and the summer brisk keeps her warm. She calms as she arrives on her home street. The cars along the sidewalk shine through the mist of fallen rain. The worn smell of fabric in her interior car fills the air as the outside becomes a stream. sarah, in her oversized sweater, pulls into her driveway. Her copy of  “velvet on the grass” by mark shwartz swings on the passenger side seat. The dainty shade of mellow grey greets Sarah as her 2006 altima stops. She breathes for moment before a man knocks on her window. He’s tall, in all black, it's her boyfriend. Her heart drops as the strings she sown within her chest can only hold so much, the initial sanctuary of love versus the ultimate reality she sits in. Her breath fades like casper. She opens her car door, and for a moment, she feels hope, like there’s still a chance to live her dreams she let go of.

Her boyfriend, who could care less for his well being, has an underlying trait sarah cant be blind to, he’s insufferable. Like many of her friends and even her mother, she’s convinced herself he just has issues he needs to resolve, until her boyfriend, George Meyers, hangs on the car door and manages to bring up the one thing Sarah hates to think of, her Mother. “You walk like your mother” George remarked. Sarah walks right past him, onto the walkway towards her door, the cold drops rushing her in. As she enters her wooden 1900s home, she wipes the water, or tears running down her face, unsure of which. The memory of her mother on the napatree shoreline, whisks like a moment light from a flame before being blown out by her boyfriend closing the door behind her. 

 She stands waiting for the water to stop dripping. Her boots squeak at the slip of drenched wooden floors. George grabs her coat from her and hands her a towel after using it himself. Sarah looks at him with a flame and wandering slip to end it all. But she holds herself and aims for her room where she lays into the bed and sighs loudly. She once screamed in her childhood from hearing her mother and father argue so much, she now keeps her voice shut for only the most necessary of words. George walks into the room without any light on. He turns on the light and says to her “I left you some food i order on the table, are you plan on eating tonite?” Sarah lurks in her moment of solitude, jumping to the thought of actually answering, she decides to keep quiet this time. George, giving up, shuts off lights and walks back out as he eyes her with concern.

Sarah has been all around with her emotions for the past 4 months. Almost 1 year ago today her mother passed away and her father has been reported missing. Just when things became steady with george and she finally got the home she was dreaming of. A fear she would never expect invaded her heart, where has her parents gone? Her mother was 57 when she passed away, police reported bruises on her wrists similar to being tied, but the autopsy indicated she died of a heart attack. Sarah was dropping mail off to her mother, when she pushed the door but could not get beyond the frame. Something was blocking it. It was her mother. As Sarah pushed harder she began to see inside the home. Thats when she spotted her mother's foot on the floor. This decade has been good for rhode island. No major murders and few petty crimes. But since discovering her mother passed, Sarah’s dream home has now become a hole she sleeps in. 

A townhouse by the bay with cape cod renovations, and walkable to the pier. Expensive in her part of rhode island. Sarah’s eyes peel open into the dark room, the faint condensation on her bedroom window shines from red to yellow as she remembers the belongings her mother left her. Some jewelery and miscellaneous items but amongst the rings one came with a paper of her birth certificate and in the place of the father was a name Sarah didnt recognize, Jay Moorie. The ring, a gold band cherried by a 14k diamond, had a year on the band, 1989. But her father married her mother in 1994. Her eyes perk quickly followed by a groggy heavy fog in her head. She remembers the birth certificate mentions the place of the address they stayed at the time, if she can get in touch with the owner of the apartment, she can ask if the previous owners left an address they left to, and maybe that could be a lead to her real father.

She gets up in to a dark hall of cape cod interior. The glare of warm light in the distance is the only source she sees. Walking towards it, she piers into the living room looking for their office desk, where george is napping with the tv on. An endearing memory of her supposed ""father"" sleeping the same way crosses her mind as she sneaks to the desk. She‘s sure she remembered putting her mother's valuables in a locked cabinet. But she doesnt see the key on the table. She tosses a few items around, a letter, a lamp, to no avail. Then she begins to scour the entire surface and floor for this key. George awakens and sloppily says “ugh, Sarah, you woke me, what are you looking for?"" Sarah responds with angst ""What did you do with the key on the desk, I swore I just left it here"". George breathes out his exhaustion, ""Its in the kitchen drawer with the other keys.” Sarah, gives up for a moment, feeling defeated, the number of keys they have in there wears her out. But she drowned her pain, and headed towards the kitchen, slapping george on the chest with a mail letter. She furiously opens the drawer with the keys flaring in sharp twang. The noise dies down into the passing pop from a window coating in pedals of rain, softening her mood. She recognizes the key from its ruby tinted shine. She hurries to the office drawer and opens it, grabbing the birth certificate, it says 1774 Corbin Lane, Eastfield, Rhode island. She heads to her room and grabs her car keys and on her way out she tells George she'll be leaving... to the post office. George says to her “ok, dont be long”. She heads out in excitement.

The corner of her dark hall to the outside door stops Sarah as she kicked it by accident on  her way out. Her eye catches the portrait of her mother and supposed father. She stops her hustle, to remember the warm blankets her mother would hand her, the delicate jewelry box she crafted with her ‘father’, for a moment, the world feels at home again. Until she steps into the foot of her despair. She could head out and find her true dad, if that's even true, or stay inside, lay on the couch next to george, and enjoy her life for what she’s got. And she’s not happy with what she's got. Out of the search for something better, or just to get away for it all, she opens the door and heads out, next stop, 1774 Corbin Lane, Eastfield, Rhode island.

The aggravated tussle of forfeited admission stands as love with no bounds, but shakes the ground she stand on. Sarah has made up her mind, before she knew it. She would find out who her true father was even if it was her current supposed “father”. She sat in her baked suede car seat with a cold coffee in her cup holder from hours before beside her. The corner of the market street, Herbert Lane, sits in furbished calmness. Drops of scattered light amongst canopies on stores, unharmed, without the numerous footsteps of a city lane. Sarah drives past unaware where she’s passing. All she remembers is Corbin lane from a street in her old friend’s neighborhood in Eastfield. In the mist of the fallen rain, beyond the floating drops of water, Sarah sees the sign, Corbin Lane. She hits the breaks only for the wheels to lock in place as her car glides for a split second, and stumps back into control. Her rush of anticipation is withered, but she had to know what was on that street, Sarah holds down the brakes, with every breath she can count, she is waiting for her turn. She enters Corbin lane, underneath a powdered grey sky, as if a storm was about to blow. Several washed out houses, only studio sizes with backyards much larger than the house, pride the beginning of corbin lane. Sarah slowly drives, watching for house numbers, 1998, 1996… A boy young on the front yard of the houses rushes near the edge of sidewalk to grab a small basketball his friends threw too far, Sarah irks with impatience. 1821, 1819… she’s close… she looks up with enjoyment and optimism, hoping she’d somehow remember the home from when she was a baby. She looks again, 1778, 1776, 1774 corbin lane.

Sarah remembers when she could feel alive again, she thinks about it like it was a moment to die for. Just as her birth home comes into view, Sarah holds onto hope, that maybe someone will be there on the other side of that door. Someone who can tell her about the last owners. She parks her car and grips harder on the steering wheel. Relaxing her tensions, she breathes a bit. Soft and submissive to the predicament, adamant and determined to find her true father. She steps out into the drizzling rain, barely dry street, towards the house. Her second thoughts prance in her head until shes face to face with the door. She fists her hands, sleeves caught between her palms, and knocks. 20 seconds pass… she knocks again. “Hello? Is anybody home?”. A voice calls from behind the door, it's a woman's voice she says “Just a moment”. At that moment, the drizzle intensified into rain. Sarah still waiting by the door clenches within the cold drops of rains as a dainty aged lady slowly opens the door and says “Hello sweetheart, how can i help you?”

The calmness of life is often forgotten when you're caught between all the pain this world has to offer and the goal you can’t forget. The old lady looks up at sarah with sincerity and sarah asks “um, Hi miss, sorry to bother you,I was wondering if you knew the last owners?"" The lady looks down for a second and, slowly, tries to look up again. She says “young lady, this place is rented.” Sarah’s eyes give way to an unsuspected response. She thinks for a second,” do you happen to know where can i find this landlords office?”. She then asks her that question. The old lady response was, unhelpful at best, she told sarah she had no clue who the landlords are, their location or number, that her son took care of that for her. The lady closes the door in momentary remorse for sarah. Sarah, standing in the pouring rain, making up ideas, a way forward, begins to lose grip as her options feel grim. A scent of wet asphalt begins to overwhelm sarah, the same thing she was admiring before she walked in on her mother.  
  
Before sarah begins to walk back to her car, the old lady opens the door again, soft with age yet still frantically. She peels the door open, holding a phone and says “oh, young lady, i’ve got my son on the phone, if you’d like to ask him.” sarah, holds back the tears she was about to let out. But not without one escaping. Sarah with joy says “Yes, thank you.” She is handed the phone and on it she hears the voice. Sarah talks to the man with patience and anticipation as the very information she was about to break over is handed to her. A glory reminding her, there is something to be happy about. 

Sarah walks back to her car, ecstatic about her opportunity, praising life, and then she enters the car. Stationary in her car, can’t help but feel empty. Despite, this moment of reward, she remembers how this all got started. She looks at her phone, wishing she could just talk to her mother for help. Hear her dismissiveness with experience, be told she’s just making a fuss out of nothing, but Sarah can’t do that. Sarah falls into tears. She had thought she would go the day without doing so. But here she is. A whisper in her head peers in. Its her mothers voice. Sarah must surely be imagining the voice, as her mother’s voice tells her, “if you cant call me, text me.” A memory sarah has of her mother once telling her. Sarah wipes her soaked skin, just barely resisting a frown as she opens her phone and goes to text her mother. “I miss you \*heart emoji\*”. 

The clouds begin to open as a sunlight pours through, landing on sarah’s car. Sarah doesn't even notice the increased brightness. She's instead focused on her text to her mother. As if she were holding her hand one last time. As Sarah begins to move away from that moment and into reality the clouds close again, Sarah looks up and just only notices her moment of relief fading. She wonders where did it all go. Just as she begins to feel ok and now, now she can’t find a drop of content. She turns the car on and puts it in drive. With the address from the old lady’s son, she can atleast sleep for today and fight again tomorrow. Tired and fraught, she dreams of her bed the whole way home, until she falls asleep in her mattress.

1ofdg7y,https://www.reddit.com/r/DigitalPiano/comments/1ofdg7y/pianomotion_give_life_back_to_selfplaying_piano/,PianoMotion - Give Life Back To Self-Playing Piano,"Bonjour! I’m a piano and tech enthusiast, and I just finished developing **PianoMotion**, an Android app that lets you play **any piano MIDI file wirelessly via Bluetooth** on your acoustic player piano (Yamaha Disklavier, Steinway Spirio, Bösendorfer CEUS, PianoDisc, QRS, …).

📥 **Download the APK here:** [PianoMotion on GitHub](https://github.com/KevinChopin/PianoMotion)

How it works:

1. Plug a **Bluetooth MIDI adapter** (Yamaha MD-BT01, CME WIDI Master, or any compatible model) into your piano’s MIDI ports.
2. Connect your phone via Bluetooth.
3. Load any piano MIDI file.
4. Press **play** – watch your piano perform!

**Why I made it:**

There are very few accessible apps that truly unlock the magic of these instruments. I wanted to create something **simple, free, and ad-free**, so anyone could enjoy their piano, no matter its age.

I built **PianoMotion** because it was frustrating to see manufacturers either **offer only poor-quality apps** for their pianos or **abandon older instruments entirely**, pushing you to buy a new one without proper software support. With PianoMotion, you can **play your favorite MIDI tracks, record your own performances, revive old Disklavier floppy disks**, (and soon even **sing along while your piano plays the backing**!). NB: App is currently in French but English version is coming soon.

Features:

* 🎵 Play MIDI files wirelessly via Bluetooth
* 🎹 Record and replay your own performances
* 🔜 Soon: “Voice + MIDI” mode – sing while your piano plays
* 💖 Completely free and ad-free

**Try it & Give Feedback**

I’d love for everyone to try PianoMotion. Your bug reports, suggestions, and feature ideas are what will help make this app better and more enjoyable for the piano community.

If you want to see the disklavier in action : [Alicia (Clair Obscur Expedition 33) on Yamaha Disklavier - PianoMotion App Demo](https://youtu.be/GSs-DGnv-rc)

Thanks for reading, and let’s make our pianos sing again!

I am clumsy and I get cared easily Idk why but apparently it's a laughing stock for my mom and brothers and sisters and cousins and aunts and uncles. They think it's funny how I react in panic.  I didn't really mind it before when it was all about me, but now that I have a daughter the bad thoughts in my brain started to increase and somehow like a final destination type of scenario plays in my brain but ofcourse it never happened. But whenever igeythese thoughts I visibly shake or tremble a lil? But yeah prolly funny.
 
My mom lives on a 4th floor, that's high af, and my brother just decides to hold my daughter up and ""joke"" about throwing her out the window. Ofcourse, i panic and take my daughter away from him, but my mom, and everyone else just errupts laughing because me reacting like this is something stupid people would do. My cousins, mind u they're wayy younger thn me, decides to come in the room when I'm making my daughter sleep and laugh and try to wake her up. I've been barely functioning lately because of no sleep and my own parents have set the standard of annoying me as norms. If I get mat at them I'm wrong. I don't let my baby watch any screen, but I'm a friggin b*tch according to them because she ""wants "" to watch it. Same with sugary beverages and coffees and evergy drinks and everything possible, my baby is malnutritioned according to everyone and I sont feed her so ofcourse they're gonna step in and feed her crap. 

My husband himself is meh, all he never cares about is his studies and his family(parents n siblings) he's not a talker or enjoys talking especially to me I guess....but thn again, he stresses financially because he have two families to feed, his mom dad sisters and his brothers wife and children. We kinda just live in poverty. Job opertunities are non exsistant after having a baby that I domt really complain anymore. My husband does help me with housework, quite often actually, but whenever he does, he's mad, as if I'm his mom making him do all the chores, he thinks providing is everything....maybe it is.

I had pretty normal friends throughout high-school and university and all, but never actually got any love from my family...maybe they do love me but I'm not able to see it..

I haven't ever been a priority in my entire life....not even when I thought I was the priority... I have a few really good friends but I kinda don't wanna rant to them and neither do I tell them how I get treated. Tbh I don't mind it if it's about me, laugh about it and get over it I don't care, but they now think it's funny using my daughter. I'm staying here rn and will be going back tomorrow, and I am so filled me hatred Idk what to do about life anymore.


I always dreamt of a life where someone...just cares a little... all I have now is my daughter....but ofcourse she's gonna do what she sees. ",1,1761350737.0,Rants,0,1.0,False

Spiritual enlightenment sits next to an empty milk carton on an orange lunch tray in a gradeschool cafeteria. 

It's lying in the grass in a ditch beside a rusting hubcap. It's on the button holding closed the left cuff of a somewhat important man's shirt. 

Enlightenment can be found next to the elevator on the fourth level of the airport parking garage. You can ask your dog for it, but he may not give it to you. 

Look for it next to the pen in the pocket of the checkout girl's red vest, But only on Wednesdays. Enlightenment is in the trunk, behind the jack. You can hear it in the squeak of a hinge at the local library. It's in the breeze blowing unheard through an unseen tree. It's in the space after the exhale and before the inhale. 

You can find enlightenment in church, in that scratch on the back of the pew in front of you. 

You can find it in the desert, just before the wind picks up again. 

Enlightenment is nothing. Delusion is the greatest wonder. 

Enlightenment was in your coffee cup before you poured in the coffee. Now it's in your coffee cup. Two point two billion years before your coffee cup was created, Enlightenment was in your coffee cup. An hour and fifteen minutes after time swallows the universe, Enlightenment will be in your coffee cup. 

You've always known where it is because it's exactly where you left it. How can you not return to a place you never left? You are dreaming that you are unenlightened. You are dreaming that you are awake. 

The question is: Why? The answer is: Why not?

I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection and engagement with another person. More simply? I want someone to casually chat with daily. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul. All in the same person? Wonderful! But I don’t have such lofty expectations of anyone – including of myself. Let’s feel each other out to know what’s possible and what we’d like to see happen.

So, who am I exactly? And who are you?

I'm 35, male, and live in the US (ET time zone). Thoroughly introverted, but bold and open when the mood strikes and with those who can tap into that aspect of me. I’m designed for the slow burn and deliberation of written conversation, but am an adopter of voice chat, which I sometimes even prefer if I really vibe with someone.

Incremental exchange and a mutual creation is what I default to, but I've gone to the ends of the earth on a whim with the right person before. I adore abstract minds that get idiosyncrasy and whimsy. Compatibility is a strange thing, though, that feels most real when it’s too fluid to be defined.

Rumination and contemplation are lifelong pursuits of mine. I’m an autodidact who’s been passionate about a variety of persuasions since I’ve been young. I’m most infatuated with the nature and function of reality, and particularly human perception. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that a lack of limitation is highly limiting.

Creativity and artistry are important to me. Personally, I write: about my observations, thoughts, and lived experiences. I also adore writing conversationally, from mundane chats to lengthy letters, often permeated with a dim poetic glow. Photography also has a hold on me, and I hope to do more than just dabble in it.

I like burning incense, time pieces, archiving and organization, collecting, and coffee. I’m always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies. I so probably have more I take for granted.

2: 1 optional IRL character per roster (debut not created)

3: But no IRL politics. |

4: Anime is allowed|

5: (can't believe I'm saying it but) actual sentient characters only. (blame PMK-3 for me establishing this rule) |

6: characters that people know, people like a random person who isn't named enjoying a coffee and is never shown again won't count (blame PMK-3 for me establishing this rule) |

7: the limit for each series representatives is 10 (except for Clash of Clans/Clash Royale that mfer can stay at 8)

8: don't downvote, if you see a submission you don't like, ignore it, don't downvote it. |

I usually add the character at around 7:00 PM (in Massachusetts time) (or 1 hour before I post)|

If a tie happens I'll have to consult.... The Wheel. |

He who joins the roster, like myself, he won't be able to suggest any other character because he in turn becomes the character. |",3,1761350441.0,SmashBrosRosters,11,1.0,False

Even if I have frozen pizzas in the fridge which is my kryptonite I’ve been know to make a coffee to satiate the hunger rather than eat a nutrient dense meal.  I will only relent when I’m borderline low blood sugar freaking out and shaking and sweating then I give in and eat but my depression stops me from eating.  The joy of food doesn’t seem to appeal to me most of the time.  

I always thought eating disorder existed on the extremes or fringes, people who want to be thin and develop a hate for food or people who love it too much and eat it too often.  I think I may be in the latter category because I sometimes binge eat ice cream and chips when the sadness level is strongest.  ",2,1761350331.0,EDAnonymous,1,1.0,False
1ofdap5,https://www.reddit.com/r/bayarea/comments/1ofdap5/some_silicon_valley_moments_i_experienced_in_my/,"Some ""Silicon Valley"" moments I experienced in my 31 year career as a programmer (1992 - 2023)","I don't know where to post this, but I'm feeling nostalgic because I moved away from the Bay Area 5 years ago and miss living there (I do visit fairly regularly to see friends and my family but it isn't the same as living there).

**Silicon Valley Moment #1:** In 2002 I went to lunch with a friend I met in college.  I thought we were catching up and having food, she asked me to ""partner up"" and do a startup.  I have no idea at all why I said ""yes"", but I did and we started a company to ""block email spam"" together.  It was practically a religious calling to me.  I was so angry at email spammers and wanted to fight back.  We made a little money, enough to fund the next company without VC funds...

Slight background: Around 2007/2008 I helped form the next startup company (I'm a programmer) that was based out of my dive 1 bedroom apartment to save money.  This is what my living room looked like with cubicle walls in 2008 (this is a 1 bedroom apartment): https://www.ski-epic.com/backblazetimeline/p22b_2008_02_01_gromit_in_office.jpg  Super shoestring in that none of us drew salaries type of a startup.

My dive 1 bedroom apartment (425A Forest Ave, Palo Alto) was about 3 blocks from the original ""Hewlett-Packard Garage"" (367 Addison Avenue, Palo Alto) which has a plaque explaining it is the start of ""Silicon Valley"" and the reason it is called a ""Garage Startup"" is because of the HP garage: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP_Garage

**So Silicon Valley Moment #2:** So as I'm walking back from lunch to the startup in Palo Alto in 2008, my next door neighbor asks, ""Hey, are you guys doing a startup in there?""  I kind of panicked and was worried he might get us kicked out and responded, ""Yes, but are we loud?  We can keep it down if it is bothering you.""  My neighbor breaks out in a huge smile and says, ""No man, it's totally cool, I work at Yahoo, if you need any help just let me know.""  

I cannot explain to you how few locations in the world that exchange would have occurred.  First, my friggin next door neighbor actually understood just from watching people come and go **WHAT** was going on.  Second, he offered help and support.  Where on earth does THAT occur other than the San Francisco Bay Area?

**Silicon Valley Moment #3:** My wife and I met at a startup in 1999 that failed and I was basically broke and homeless afterwards (really I lived on a boat I owned, I just like saying I was ""homeless"").  One of the people that worked at that startup at the same time my wife and I met was Chris Kelly: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Kelly_(entrepreneur)  This was early in Chris's career and he wasn't famous (at all) when we worked with Chris.  Chris eventually because Chief Privacy Officer at Facebook a very long time (DECADES) after my wife and I knew him.  To be totally clear we had NOTHING to do with Chris's fame and eventual wealth.  So one time my wife and I were taking a small propeller airplane flight with my elderly 85 year old father for a few hundred dollars (long story of why deleted) out of the Palo Alto municipal airport.  As I walked up to their little waiting area building I looked inside and saw Chris!  I excitedly said out loud, ""Darling, it's Chris Kelly!"" and barged inside.  Chris's private pilots/staff freaked out and ran towards me to block me, but Chris smiled this huge smile and came forward and we shook hands and the pilots/staff relaxed realizing we actually knew each other from ""25 years earlier"".  I thought it was funny.

When you spend 35 years working in Silicon Valley, you end up knowing and working with a few people that get famous long after you work with them. I think my biggest claim of brushing elbows with a ""future"" famous person is I have hot-tubbed with Reid Hastings (founder of Netflix) several decades before anybody would recognize Reid's name.  Here is my connection to Reid: My brother's roommate in college bought a house 50/50 with Reid in La Honda (maybe back in 1988?) because they were both entry level programmers and that meant they could afford a nicer house as roommates.  LOL.  I love that.  

Randomly, before he started Netflix, Reid started a company called ""Pure Software"" which was programmer tools.  Because I'm a total moron, I sent Reid an email when Reid formed ""Pure Software"" where I told him he was absolutely nuts and should not do it, (Reid make a ton of money from Pure Software and I personally ended up using Pure Software's tools as a programmer and the tools were very useful, thus I'm a dumbass and nobody should ever take my investment advice).

I heard about Netflix from the TV on a Saturday morning.  I spit out my coffee in my living room when the local news channel did a story about Netflix and there was Reid giving an interview.   Back then it was just ""mail order DVDs"".  Within a year I was a subscriber (maybe the year 2001?).  Then 6 years later Netflix started streaming and it went absolutely non-linear from that point.  

For the record, Reid Hastings was actually a nice, reasonable person (at least when I met him).  I am glad he did well for himself.    

I hope with all of my heart there are new college graduates getting jobs in the Bay Area that will have fun job experiences and enjoy their careers as much as I enjoyed my career there.  It is a totally unique place on earth for tech startups.

1ofda6y,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ofda6y,My Dad Would Have Been 67 Today,"My dad and I were estranged for many years, but oddly. He and my mother got divorced when I was 2, and then he moved 4 hours away when I was 11 to move in with his girlfriend. I would visit him in the summer, and we’d talk on the phone every couple weeks at first. 
For a variety of reasons I won’t get into, I didn’t have a good time when I was at his house. I went because I thought I had to, but I hated it. When I was 15 I learned those trips were optional, and I stopped going. 
He didn’t go to my high school or undergrad graduations, so I didn’t invite him to masters or PhD ones. We fell out of contact after I stopped visiting, though about ten years ago now he started sending me quarterly emails from the inventory computer at his job. They were always short and really surface level. 
I saw him for the first time in fifteen years last summer. We got coffee and talked exclusively about our dogs, and then when he left he burst into tears because he didn’t mean for this to be how our relationship turned out. I think that he was a very depressed man all his life, and very bad at communication. I never doubted that he loved me, but I also didn’t think that was enough, if that makes sense? 
This spring, he was diagnosed with stage 4B lung cancer. I spent the next six weeks at his bedside as much as possible. I was there for the entire six weeks of his hospitalization, I was there when he went on palliative care, and I was there when he died. 
The day before he died, the last day he could speak, he looked at me and asked “Can I be done?” 
I asked him what he meant. 
“Can I be done and see my mom again?” 
His mother died when he was 12, and he never really got over it. 
I told him of course he could. 
He kept asking me, all day. Four times in total, I think? I’ve asked since and learned that he never asked his partner or anyone else  for permission. Just me. Which feels and felt so strange. 
It’s his birthday today. Mine was two days ago. And his partner brought me a box of his things, old family photos, the wedding ring he married my mom with. And I found out he kept every single craft I ever made. This box has just - things I don’t remember making. Cardboard picture frames with pink and white pom-poms. Candle sticks made from air dry clay. 
And an empty wooden box I gave him for Father’s Day at some point. I’m guessing I was five or younger, based on the handwriting on the note. It says “Dear daddy, here is a box of kisses. I blew them just for you. Love Sophie” 
He kept it for 25 years. Maybe more. He’s had it the whole time. 
I don’t know what to do with that. The whole time when I thought he just — couldn’t be bothered, I guess? Didn’t want to make the effort? Didn’t know how, maybe, is the better word. And that whole time, he had these and more. He kept them. 
I didn’t cry at the photos. But I keep looking at the empty wooden box and sobbing because he kept it. He kept it the whole time. What do you even do with that? How do you make sense of it? ",19,1761350283.0,GriefSupport,2,1.0,False

I am tired of watching my life from the sidelines, trapped behind a curtain of exhaustion. This isn't just ""being tired""—it's living with narcolepsy and a beast called severe sleep inertia and hypersomnia. It's an invisible anchor that keeps me permanently moored while the rest of the world sails by.
When I truly crash, I don't just sleep; I'm gone for days. And the few moments I do manage to surface? They are defined by an unrelenting, thick brain fog that simply refuses to clear. I can clock 12 or 15 hours of sleep, only to wake up feeling like I haven't slept at all.
My body feels like it's been replaced with cement and water—my arms and legs are spaghetti, heavy and useless. I spend hours in a desperate, foggy limbo, propped up against the bathroom sink, mindlessly scrolling, trying to force my brain to switch on. Coffee, cold water, pure willpower—nothing helps. It’s a physical reality that until I get the specific medication I need, I won't wake up.
I am literally sleeping my life away. I miss out on moments. I struggle to remember what it feels like to be truly present, alert, and engaged. There is a deep, painful realization that this condition is not just affecting my energy; it is erasing my life.
I desperately want to feel the sun on my face, be fully in the conversation, and stop fighting this exhausting battle just to feel functional for a few hours. I am tired of not living. I deserve ￼to be present, and I am  ￼  constantly searching for a way to break free from this overwhelming sleep. #multiplesclerosis #narcolepsy #narcolepsyawareness #narcolepsywithsleepinertia

Then this morning I was making coffee and it hit me - wait, this isn't about AI remembering stuff. This is way bigger.

**Every company I've worked at has the same problem**: all the knowledge about ""how we actually do things"" lives in three terrible places:

1. Docs that nobody reads (seriously when's the last time you opened Confluence)
2. Senior people's heads (who will eventually leave)
3. Random Slack messages you can never find when you need them

And you spend SO much energy just... making sure people follow the process? Like ""did you do the security review"" ""did you use the right template"" ""did you check with legal"" etc etc.

With Skills though - and I'm still wrapping my head around this - you just write down how something should be done ONCE, as an executable skill. Then whenever someone on the team uses Claude, it auto-loads. The compliance stuff, the quality standards, the ""here's how we do this"" knowledge... it just happens.

No more ""hey did you remember to..."" meetings.

I tried this with our team's code review process last week. Wrote a skill with our standards. Now anyone on the team - including the new junior dev who started Monday - gets the same quality bar automatically when they ask Claude to review their PR.

The manager part changes too. You're not checking if people followed the steps anymore. You're just defining what good output looks like and how thorough the review should be. Then AI agents execute and you're just looking at results.

Oh and the priority queue thing - we used to have 10 tasks and 5 engineers, so endless debates about what to build first. Now we just... start multiple things at once? Because agents are executing and compute is cheap. Obviously you still need to decide WHAT to build strategically. But the ""who's available to work on this"" bottleneck is just... gone?

I don't know, maybe I'm overthinking this. But it feels like a fundamental shift from ""managing people's time"" to ""managing quality and methods.""

1ofcr97,https://www.reddit.com/r/ScienceHumour/comments/1ofcr97/the_truth_about_dihydrogen_monoxide_satire_dhmo/,"The truth about Dihydrogen Monoxide (Satire, DHMO is just H_2_O, which is Water)","Frequently Asked Questions About Dihydrogen Monoxide (DHMO)

What is Dihydrogen Monoxide?

Dihydrogen Monoxide (DHMO) is a colorless and odorless chemical compound, also referred to by some as Dihydrogen Oxide, Hydrogen Hydroxide, Hydronium Hydroxide, or simply Hydric acid. Its basis is the highly reactive hydroxyl radical, a species shown to mutate DNA, denature proteins, disrupt cell membranes, and chemically alter critical neurotransmitters. The atomic components of DHMO are found in a number of caustic, explosive and poisonous compounds such as Sulfuric Acid, Nitroglycerine and Ethyl Alcohol.
For more detailed information, including precautions, disposal procedures and storage requirements, refer to one of the Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) available for DHMO:

Kemp Compliance & Safety MSDS for DHMO
Chem-Safe, Inc. MSDS for Dihydrogen Monoxide
Applied Petrochemical Research MSDS for Hydric Acid
Original DHMO.org Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for Dihydrogen Monoxide (html)
Should I be concerned about Dihydrogen Monoxide?

Yes, you should be concerned about DHMO! Although the U.S. Government and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) do not classify Dihydrogen Monoxide as a toxic or carcinogenic substance (as it does with better known chemicals such as hydrochloric acid and benzene), DHMO is a constituent of many known toxic substances, diseases and disease-causing agents, environmental hazards and can even be lethal to humans in quantities as small as a thimbleful.	
	Research conducted by award-winning U.S. scientist Nathan Zohner concluded that roughly 86 percent of the population supports a ban on dihydrogen monoxide. Although his results are preliminary, Zohner believes people need to pay closer attention to the information presented to them regarding Dihydrogen Monoxide. He adds that if more people knew the truth about DHMO then studies like the one he conducted would not be necessary.

A similar study conducted by U.S. researchers Patrick K. McCluskey and Matthew Kulick also found that nearly 90 percent of the citizens participating in their study were willing to sign a petition to support an outright ban on the use of Dihydrogen Monoxide in the United States.

Why haven't I heard about Dihydrogen Monoxide before?

Good question. Historically, the dangers of DHMO, for the most part, have been considered minor and manageable. While the more significant dangers of Dihydrogen Monoxide are currently addressed by a number of agencies including FDA, FEMA and CDC, public awareness of the real and daily dangers of Dihydrogen Monoxide is lower than some think it should be.
Critics of government often cite the fact that many politicians and others in public office do not consider Dihydrogen Monoxide to be a ""politically beneficial"" cause to get behind, and so the public suffers from a lack of reliable information on just what DHMO is and why they should be concerned.		Part of the blame lies with the public and society at large. Many do not take the time to understand Dihydrogen Monoxide, and what it means to their lives and the lives of their families.
Unfortunately, the dangers of DHMO have increased as world population has increased, a fact that the raw numbers and careful research both bear out. Now more than ever, it is important to be aware of just what the dangers of Dihydrogen Monoxide are and how we can all reduce the risks faced by ourselves and our families.

What are some of the dangers associated with DHMO?

Each year, Dihydrogen Monoxide is a known causative component in many thousands of deaths and is a major contributor to millions upon millions of dollars in damage to property and the environment. Some of the known perils of Dihydrogen Monoxide are:
	
Death due to accidental inhalation of DHMO, even in small quantities.
Prolonged exposure to solid DHMO causes severe tissue damage.
Excessive ingestion produces a number of unpleasant though not typically life-threatening side-effects.
DHMO is a major component of acid rain.
Gaseous DHMO can cause severe burns.
Contributes to soil erosion.
Leads to corrosion and oxidation of many metals.
Contamination of electrical systems often causes short-circuits.
Exposure decreases effectiveness of automobile brakes.
Found in biopsies of pre-cancerous tumors and lesions.
Given to vicious dogs involved in recent deadly attacks.
Often associated with killer cyclones in the U.S. Midwest and elsewhere, and in hurricanes including deadly storms in Florida, New Orleans and other areas of the southeastern U.S.
Thermal variations in DHMO are a suspected contributor to the El Nino weather effect.
What are some uses of Dihydrogen Monoxide?

Despite the known dangers of DHMO, it continues to be used daily by industry, government, and even in private homes across the U.S. and worldwide. Some of the well-known uses of Dihydrogen Monoxide are:

as an industrial solvent and coolant,
in nuclear power plants,
by the U.S. Navy in the propulsion systems of some older vessels,
by elite athletes to improve performance,
in the production of Styrofoam,
in biological and chemical weapons manufacture,
in the development of genetically engineered crops and animals,
as a spray-on fire suppressant and retardant,
in so-called ""family planning"" or ""reproductive health"" clinics,
as a major ingredient in many home-brewed bombs,
as a byproduct of hydrocarbon combustion in furnaces and air conditioning compressor operation,
in cult rituals,
by the Church of Scientology on their members and their members' families (although surprisingly, many members recently have contacted DHMO.org to vehemently deny such use),
by both the KKK and the NAACP during rallies and marches,
by members of Congress who are under investigation for financial corruption and inappropriate IM behavior,
by the clientele at a number of bath houses in New York City and San Francisco,
historically, in Hitler's death camps in Nazi Germany, and in prisons in Turkey, Serbia, Croatia, Libya, Iraq and Iran,
in World War II prison camps in Japan, and in prisons in China, for various forms of torture,
during many recent religious and ethnic wars in the Middle East,
by many terrorist organizations including al Qaeda,
in community swimming pools to maintain chemical balance,
in day care centers, purportedly for sanitary purposes,
by software engineers, including those producing DICOM software and other DICOM software tools,
by popular computer science professors,
by aspiring young adult fiction writers and mental health advocates,
by international travel bloggers,
by the semi-divine King Bhumibol of Thailand and his many devoted young working girls in Bangkok,
by the fearsome yet kind and drug-free Hells Angels motorcycle gang,
by the British Chiropractic Association and the purveyors of the bogus treatments that the BCA promotes,
by commodities giant Trafigura in their well-publicized and widely-known toxic-waste dumping activities in Ivory Coast,
in animal research laboratories, and
in pesticide production and distribution.
What you may find surprising are some of the products and places where DHMO is used, but which for one reason or another, are not normally made part of public presentations on the dangers to the lives of our family members and friends. Among these startling uses are:
as an additive to food products, including jarred baby food and baby formula, and even in many soups, carbonated beverages and supposedly ""all-natural"" fruit juices
in cough medicines and other liquid pharmaceuticals,
in spray-on oven cleaners,
in shampoos, shaving creams, deodorants and numerous other bathroom products,
in bathtub bubble products marketed to children,
as a preservative in grocery store fresh produce sections,
in the production of beer by all the major beer distributors,
in the coffee available at major coffee houses in the US and abroad,
in Formula One race cars, although its use is regulated by the Formula One Racing Commission, and
as a target of ongoing NASA planetary and stellar research.



One of the most surprising facts recently revealed about Dihydrogen Monoxide contamination is in its use as a food and produce ""decontaminant."" Studies have shown that even after careful washing, food and produce that has been contaminated by DHMO remains tainted by DHMO.
What is the link between Dihydrogen Monoxide and gun violence?

	The incidence of gun violence seems to be rising at an alarming rate. A recent stunning revelation is that in every single instance of violence involving guns, both in the U.S. and internationally, Dihydrogen Monoxide was involved. In fact, DHMO is often very available to those who would do harm to others. Meanwhile, apparently no efforts have been made to limit the availability of this potentially dangerous chemical compound.
How does Dihydrogen Monoxide toxicity affect kidney dialysis patients?

Unfortunately, DHMO overdose is not unheard of in patients undergoing dialysis treatments for kidney failure. Dihydrogen Monoxide overdose in these patients can result in congestive heart failure, pulmonary edema and hypertension. In spite of the danger of accidental overdose and the inherent toxicity of DHMO in large quantities for this group, there is a portion of the dialysis treated population that continues to use DHMO on a regular basis.
Are there groups that oppose a ban on Dihydrogen Monoxide?

In spite of overwhelming evidence, there is one group in California that opposes a ban on Dihydrogen Monoxide. The Friends of Hydrogen Hydroxide is a group that believes that the dangers of DHMO have been exaggerated. Members claim that Dihydrogen Monoxide, or the less emotionally charged and more chemically accurate term they advocate for it, ""Hydrogen Hydroxide,"" is beneficial, environmentally safe, benign and naturally occurring. They argue that efforts to ban DHMO are misguided.
Friends of Hydrogen Hydroxide is supported by the Scorched Earth Party, a radical and loosely-organized California-based group. Sources close to the Scorched Earth Party deny any outside funding from government, industry or pro-industry PACs.


Has the press ignored this web site and the Dihydrogen Monoxide problem?

For the most part, the press has not reported on the dangers of Dihydrogen Monoxide as much as some would like. Although many private individuals have put up web sites in a major grassroots effort to spread the word, major publications have not.
Recently, attention has been paid to the subject thanks to an incident in Aliso Viejo, California.  This so-called Aliso Viejo Incident was widely reported in the media, although the director of DHMO.org, Dr. Tom Way, was called a ""prankster.""  Once the Associated Press started circulating the story, it became fact, and the valuable information being provided by the DHMO.org website was deemed to be ""rubbish"" rather than an honest and unbiased recounting of facts about a dangerous, life-endangering chemical compound.

If you are a member of the press, you may access our online Press Kit.  See the main page for access information.  This resource is for members of the press only.

 

Is it true that using DHMO improves athletic performance?

Absolutely! With the numerous allegations of amateur and professional athletes using anabolic steroids and/or blood doping to enhance performance, virtually no attention has been paid to the performance enhancing properties of Dihydrogen Monoxide. It is perhaps the sporting world's dirtiest of dirty little secrets that athletes regularly ingest large quantities of DHMO in an effort to gain a competitive edge over an opponent.

One technique commonly used by endurance athletes in sports such as distance running and cycling is to take a large amount of DHMO immediately prior to a race. This is known within racing circles to dramatically improve performance.

Sports-medicine physicians warn that ingesting too much Dihydrogen Monoxide can lead to complications and unwanted side-effects, but do acknowledge the link to improved performance. DHMO is not currently considered a banned substance, so post-race urine tests do not detect elevated or abnormal levels of DHMO.

Can using DHMO improve my marriage?

	This is a popular myth, but one which is also actually supported by a number of scientific facts. Dihydrogen Monoxide plays an instrumental role in the centers of the brain associated with feelings of emotional attachment and love. Married couples have found that regular ingestion of DHMO can improve their marriage-related activities, while couples that never ingest DHMO often find that their marriage suffers as well. 
What are the symptoms of accidental Dihydrogen Monoxide overdose?

You may not always recognize that you have been a victim of accidental DHMO overdose, so here are some signs and symptoms to look for. If you suspect Dihydrogen Monoxide overdose, or if you exhibit any of these symptoms, you should consult with your physician or medical practitioner. The data presented here is provided for informational purposes only, and should in no way be construed as medical advice of any sort.
	
Watch for these symptoms:

Excessive sweating
Excessive urination
Bloated feeling
Nausea
Vomiting
Electrolyte imbalance
Hyponatremia (serum hypotonicity)
Dangerously imbalanced levels of ECF and ICF in the blood
Degeneration of sodium homeostasis
A recently noted medical phenomenon involves small amounts of DHMO leaking or oozing from the corners of the eyes as a direct result of causes such as foreign particulate irritation, allergic reactions including anaphylactic shock, and sometimes severe chemical depression.

What is a chemical analysis of Dihydrogen Monoxide

Recently, German analytical chemist Christoph von Bueltzingsloewen at the Universitaet Regensburg identified what may be key reasons why the dangers of DHMO are ever present. According to von Bueltzingsloewen, the chemical separation of dihydrogenoxide from the hazardous oxygendihydride is extremely difficult. The two similar compounds curiously occur in nearly equimolar distribution wherever they are found. It is not clear how the two contribute directly to the dangers inherent in Dihydrogen Monoxide, although von Bueltzingsloewen believes that a synergetic mechanism, catalyzed by traces of hydrogenhydroxide, plays a major role.	
What can I do to minimize the risks?

Fortunately, there is much you can do to minimize your dangers due to Dihydrogen Monoxide exposure. First, use common sense. Whenever you are dealing with any product or food that you feel may be contaminated with DHMO, evaluate the relative danger to you and your family, and act accordingly. Keep in mind that in many instances, low-levels of Dihydrogen Monoxide contamination are not dangerous, and in fact, are virtually unavoidable. Remember, the responsibility for your safety and the safety of your family lies with you.
Second, exercise caution when there is the potential for accidental inhalation or ingestion of DHMO. If you feel uncomfortable, remove yourself from a dangerous situation. Better safe than sorry.

Third, don't panic. Although the dangers of Dihydrogen Monoxide are very real, by exercising caution and common sense, you can rest assured knowing that you are doing everything possible to keep you and your family safe.

1ofcn3p,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_OutlawWriter/comments/1ofcn3p/department_of_spiritual_defense_part_one/,Department of Spiritual Defense: Part One,"Rumors had been swirling for months that a new division in the Department of Defense was going to be formed. Conspiracy theorists claimed it had something to do with aliens, posting their wild theories all over the internet, or spewing them on late night radio shows around the country. In the opinion of the man tasked with assembling and over-seeing the new organization, the truth was far more terrifying. The veil between the world of the living and that of the dead was beginning to crumble. As a result, there had been an uptick in haunting, demonic possessions and missing children.

At first, the higher-ups had tried to downplay events as coincidences, even when the Vatican sent several Bishops to the White House and the Pentagon. The only thing that changed their opinion was an incident he had found himself in the center of. Edward Hampton was already a field agent with an impressive record before he was assigned to a task force who infiltrated and destabilized cults, and his effectiveness had him on the fast track to a promotion in near record time. That's when he got a case to investigate a small group of Neo-Pagans in Washington State.

It took him several weeks, shadowing suspected members and frequenting the book stores and coffee shops that many of them visited often, as well as seeking out Pagan meetups in the area, being seen there, mingling with people. He had found a way in through talking to a pair of twins. Starla and Steven. Both were tall, rail-thin and their hair was so blonde it looked almost albino white. They weren't quite that pale, however, both being avid hikers. They were also very active in the community, and well liked by most everyone he talked to.

After attending a few of their rituals and other gatherings, they told him that they belonged to a sort of coven. They invited him for their Samhain rites that year, and when he reported this, he was given two young rookies as support. That was the first time he saw something he couldn't explain. The group had summoned a demon into one of the living initiates, which turned out to be a mistake. It was powerful, and while it didn't seem to be telekinetic, it did prove capable of doing other things he couldn't explain. The way the man's body contorted and climbed the walls were impossible.

The way it shrugged off bullets and magical attacks was something he would have deemed impossible if he hadn't seen it for himself. He would have denied that magic and demons were real, as a matter of fact. He has seen plenty of evil, but until then, there had always been a human behind it. A manipulator, a thief, and in the worst cases, a murderer. Most of that coven had been wiped out and he had lost his support agents, as well as the lower half of his left leg. They had also failed to stop the demon which was still somewhere in the world.

He shook away the thoughts and flashbacks, subconsciously rubbing just above where the prosthetic attached to the stub of his joint. That incident had been the catalyst for his current task, and came to be named the “Whitcomb Incident” for the family that owned the farm where it happened. He stood from his seat and claimed his cane and briefcase, though he didn't the walking stick at the moment. The solid oak shaft thrummed with spiritual energy in his grip. That brought him a sense of comfort as he disembarked and walked down the stairs onto the tarmac.

A black, bullet-proof car sat nearby idling. The driver stepped out and opened the back door for him. The man didn't speak as they took their respective seats, the car already moving just moments after he arrived, the road from the small, rural airport was surrounded by open fields, but the skyline ahead of them was dominated by tall buildings. It took them early an hour to reach their destination, and Ed took a deep breath as he exited the vehicle. He met up with a small group of men near the elevator as he approached. Most of them familiar to him.

One belonged to his direct superior, the lines in the man's face and sunken cheeks giving him a care-worn and slightly haggard appearance he smiled as Edward met his gaze.

“How was your flight in?” he asked casually.

“Long, but pretty smooth.” he replied in the same tone, and they stepped into the carrige after the doors opened.

They didn't speak much more than that as they crossed the lobby to the stairwell that could only be accessed by scanning their laminated badges. They climbed three flights and had to scan their way through another door. This one opened onto an almost clinical hallway. The older man led the way toward a door that had his name painted on the frosted glass window.

“The files of the top candidates should already be in your inbox in digital and physical form. If you need help with your selections, don't hesitate to call me.” his boss said.

He nodded and then turned the knob and stepped inside the small room. His finger sought out and flicked the switch that activated the lights. The fluorescent bulbs came to life and flickered before glowing brighter and more steadily. He placed his cane against the desk and placed his case atop it, opening the lid to extract his Government issued computer. Next he signed into the local network, and checked his e-mail.

Edward sighed as he opened the first of the personnel files he had received. It was going to be a long night.

Six Months Earlier:

The pounding music and inebriated state of the people in the bar made life easier for Shayla Morris. The external noise and near constant motion of a crowd giving her something to focus on, a moment to anchor herself in. If she didn't have that, it was far too easy for her to accidentally end up reading the thoughts of her closest neighbors or even people would invade her brain. It hadn't always been that way, but the abilities had emerged on her sixteenth birthday. At first her parents didn't know how to react, fearing that their daughter was mentally ill.

That was before the morning of August 10^(th) of 1993. She had come awake early that morning, screaming and inconsolable. It took over an hour before they could bring her out of the hysterical state she had arrived at the hospital in. The sedatives failed to put her all the way under, her eyes heavy lidded and glassy but refusing to close. After some time she seemed to gain a bit of clarity, and began to ramble about an attack on the water supply. She described the exact warehouse were the group, a local eco-terrorist cell had stored the chemicals they planned to dump into the reservoir.

That had began a brief connection with the police, though she was still only a teenager. She had helped find several missing children, murder victims, and even exposed an official who had been blackmailing one of his colleagues. As she got older, she gained new control and eventually decided she wanted to lead a normal life, which is what had led her to move to the city for college, getting a job at the bar where she served food and beer to a mix of locals, college students and truckers. She had managed to stay off the radar for a while, and had settled into a routine.

This night however, something was different. There was a sort of electricity in the air, but not a positive charge. That feeling got stronger as she stepped out of the kitchen and onto the floor, following the sparks that surged through her until it felt like she was touching a live wire. That electricity and tension rose as she wove through the crowd, the feeling leading her to the back door. That's when she heard the sound of flesh on flesh. Before she knew what she was doing she stepped outside.

'*I'm going to kill this fucking whore.'* the thought slammed into her brain like a punch.

The wave of violent rage that she felt was almost overwhelming. The sound of another blow echoed off of the buildings to either side of her and she turned her head in that direction. There was a man standing over a much smaller woman. He raised his arm again and that's when Shayla spoke up.

“You might want to think twice about hitting her again.” she called, using the voice she reserved for rowdy patrons.

The man spun around, face contorted in a snarl.

“Oh, yeah? Why? You want to take her place?” he asked in a menacing whisper. He raised his arm and stepped toward her.

Shayla should have been frightened, the man was much larger than she was, but she didn't feel anything besides a flare of anger as she saw the woman's bruised, bloody face. The lights above her head and flickered pulsed as she stared into the angry eyes of the drunk man. For a moment he continued to advance, and then his body locked up.

“What the fuck?” he slurred, his mind unable to comprehend what was happening even as he felt himself being lifted from the ground.

Shayla's head twitched, just a bit to the left, and the man flew in that direction, colliding with the dumpster about thirty yards away. The woman he had been beating on looked at her, her eyes wide, and rather than saying thank you, she ran away. Shayla walked back into the bar, getting the attention of the bouncer, who called the police and kept the guy in line. His shouting about witches might have held more weight if he weren't drunk and covered in alley filth. The girl who had seen her might pose a problem, but she would cross that bridge when she got to it.

Shayla tried to focus on finishing out her shift, driving home without much more thought about the man, or his victim. She had no way of knowing that incident had put her on the radar. She didn't notice the van that sat outside her house, watching her a few weeks later.

Anthony took another pull from the disposable vaporizer before stubbing it out and then popped a tablet into his mouth, swallowing it without water before exhaling. The walls of his living room were covered with pencil drawings. Tombstones and trees with ominous, shaded figures in the pools of darkness he had created on the paper. A pair of disembodied eyes and a bow-shaped mouth, but no other distinguishing features, a twisted, inhuman face with no eyes at all. He sighed and stood up from the couch, walking to the kitchen to boil water, dumping a brick of dried noodles into that.

He strained the water and added the seasoning packet and then settled back on the couch to eat, flipping through the channels idly, but quickly grew bored. He took another pull from the THC device after he finished and then grabbed the battered green messenger bag that contained his sketchpad and pencils. He tossed the bottle of pills inside and filled his water bottle, then exited the small apartment. The hallway was empty, as usual, quiet. That was one of the reasons he had chosen this building besides the nearly dirt cheap rent.

He had always been different. Seen things that other people couldn't. Some called them ghosts, his parents had dismissed them as his imaginary friends, and when he told his pastor about them, the man proclaimed them to be demons and visions of the devil. There was an uproar in the church, and his parents came to his defense. They had cut ties and moved to a new city and when he got there, he kept his mouth shut. That didn't mean the visions stopped. In fact, they seemed to get more intense and frequent, particularly when he was sleeping.

That was when he started drawing the things he saw during these nightly interludes. Sometimes he drew the ghosts he saw in other people's houses. Most of them were mute. Some screamed and wailed, but didn't respond when he tried to communicate with them. He got better as he got older. He had also learned to control their appearance with the drugs that he took. He walked around the corner to the bus stop, waiting with the other people already there until the vehicle pulled up to the curb. He scanned his pass and took a seat, riding until the first transfer point.

He stepped out and walked toward the cemetery, where he often sat, sketching the statues of angels as well as the more typical tombstones, following a biking trail that cut between the backside of a small business park and a drainage canal, stepping aside when a couple of older men on ten-speeds came around a corner ahead. It was another ten minutes before he reached the end of the path, feet basically carrying him in the direction of the large, wrought-iron gates by muscle memory. The path was open as usual, and as happened sometimes, there was a small group of people there.

He kept his distance, and extracted his book and a pencil from inside, digging back into the satchel to grab a sharpener as well. He flipped through the pages as he glanced around, and for some reason, his gaze lingered on the group of mourners. There were only a handful of them, but the cries of one of the women cut through the rustling leaves and sounds of traffic like a knife. It was feeling that dug down inside him. He tried to ignore it, but as time moved on, and the priest finished his speech, the psychic saw the reason for her grief.

The spirit of a young girl was latched onto her. A fully formed vision of pale flesh and dark hair. He didn't know why but he got the feeling that something was very wrong. He wandered over to the grave and took one of the flowers, as well as a charcoal rubbing of the grave marker that contained the girl's name, tucking that into his sketchbook. On the way to the bus stop, he bought a newspaper. He scanned the obituary until he found the girl's name.

She had been the victim of a drunk driver. No wonder she was clinging to the only life that she knew, and the comfort of her mother. He took the flower and drawing back to his home, and with the help of a few pagans on the internet, was able to help the spirit cross over, performing a sort of remote exorcism.

On the night the sky fell in silver ropes, Elias ran toward the burning house before he knew he was running.

He had been walking home under a hush of winter stars, equations still muttering in the back of his head—fields and symmetries, the way vacuum isn’t empty but buzzing with possibility—when a red bloom opened at the end of the lane. Heat licked the dark. A cough of glass. A child’s cry like a thread thrown into his chest and pulled.

Later, he would tell himself all the good, sensible reasons: adrenaline, conditioning, stories he’d heard about what heroes do. Later, he would arrange his memory on a blackboard and give it clean names. But in the moment there was only the tug. It was not thought or plan. It was a wordless yes that arrived already chosen.

He shouldered the door with a noise that would echo for years. Smoke wrapped him. Flame wrote its fast alphabet along the ceiling. A little boy in dinosaur pajamas was standing on a chair, hands over his ears, mouth wide and white. Elias scooped him up, pressed the small heartbeat against his ribs, and stumbled backward through the hot roar. A beam fell. The floor complained. He did not consider dying until he was already outside and someone was putting a wet blanket around his shoulders and saying, “You’re mad. You could’ve—”

He looked down. Soot all over his arms. Those ridiculous dinosaurs staring from the limp sleeve draped over his arm. The boy hiccuped against his chest and then found his mother, who made a sound like a bell struck hard.

Elias sat on the curb and shook and watched the house finish its bright sentence. Sirens came late, as they do. Neighbors made a ring of helpless talk. Someone pressed a bottle of water into his hand and he drank without tasting. The boy waved at him as they were led away. Elias lifted one ash-black hand and felt his eyes burn in a new way.

That night he dreamed he was holding a mirror that did not show his face. It showed a light—soft, steady, not the knife-bright of fire but something like morning remembered. He lifted the mirror, and the light looked back. The sensation was as simple and as strange as pouring water from one glass into another and watching it remain itself. He woke with his heart ringing quietly against his ribs.

At dawn he wrote four words on the kitchen chalkboard: I saw because seen.

He stood back and frowned at the sentence as if it were a stranger who had borrowed his coat. He had to get to work. There were meetings about funding and a circuit that needed to stop heating itself to death. There was something wrong with the superconducting magnets; there is always something wrong when you want the world to behave ideally. He erased the board, drank his coffee, and walked into the day.


---

The lab wore its usual mask of competence, the holy hum of machines, light blinking its binary prayers. The whiteboard in his office still carried the previous day’s argument with Quinn about whether the multiverse was science or just a way of not blushing in front of fine-tuning. “You want to explain the knobs by imagining a room of a trillion knobs,” Quinn had said, amused. “If it works, it works.”

“If it works,” Elias had answered then. Now he ran his hand over the faint ghosts of their formulas and felt only hunger.

He spent the morning lecturing about vacuum fluctuations to a room of (mostly) awake students. He told them with sober delight that the ground state—the thing you’d think was nothing—seethed with almosts. He drew froth on the chalkboard, virtual pairs popping up and canceling like apologies. He said in a tone he hoped was careful and not prophetic that our best equations refuse to be empty. A hand went up and wanted to know why emptiness had rules. Elias laughed and said, “Because we are lucky enough to live in a universe where the emptiness has grammar.”

He could answer how like a craftsman. But the why kept standing in the back of the room, hat in hand.

After class, he walked out under a cold blue and felt the world too detailed. The red of a student’s scarf. The strange courage of a pigeon hopping between feet. A man in a doorway holding a paper cup as if it might warm him from the inside out if he believed hard enough. Elias put a bill in and felt the small, embarrassing thrill of being good and the larger, steady ache of inadequacy.

“Bless you,” the man said, and for one strange instant the words seemed literal—like being brushed by something old as weather.

That night, he opened books he had neglected: philosophers who demanded he slow down, poets who refused to apologize for mystery. He found himself lifting the mirror of his dream again, in memory. Inside it the light watched him gently. He whispered into the empty apartment, “Why do I feel as if the seeing is mutual?”

No answer, except the soft reply of his own breath and the refrigerator’s sigh.

He thought of the burning house and the tug, the way the world had not felt neutral when the small voice cried. The universe of equations had not disappeared. It had simply stepped back to make room for something that did not fit on his chalkboard. He did not like not fitting. He fell asleep resisting and asking and hovered a while in the place where asking becomes a kind of praise.


---

Weeks passed. The days moved like beads on a string. The child from the fire appeared sometimes in the grocery store or at the park, and Elias would feel shy around him, as if caught in an intimacy—two people who had nearly met their ends in each other’s presence. The boy would wave. He’d wave back.

It was winter when Quinn invited him to the desert observatory. “You need to be under a sky that made fewer choices,” she said. “Come work on the background noise. Or just breathe where it’s thin enough to let the questions through.”

They drove into a land so open the wind felt like a thought without a body. The observatory crouched on a red hill like a patient animal. At night, they opened the dome and let what was out there fall in. The microwave background sang its old, old song into metal. The sky was so full of cold fire that Elias forgot to be grave and laughed out loud and did not feel embarrassed.

They spoke of beginnings in a language that had learned to be careful with the word before. They muttered inflation and false vacua and tunneling events and all the handy magic tricks reality might have up its sleeve if you grant it sleeves. They let themselves speak of multiverses the way children speak of castles—too seriously, with an earnestness that keeps the joy from dripping away.

On the third night, after equations had done what equations could do—carved air into clean shapes and then sighed—Elias sat alone on the last concrete step before the open ground. The desert was a big listening. The instruments clicked softly as they cooled.

“Why something rather than nothing?” he said without meaning to say it out loud.

There were a thousand good ways to answer if you were allowed to avoid the question. Because if not something, then no one to ask. Because the null set is elegant, but it doesn’t throw apple blossoms in spring. Because a vacuum isn’t nothing and never was, and the first light woke because the rules said it could. He made little stacks of such answers and watched them fall.

“Why anything?” he said again, smaller.

The word that came back wasn’t carried on the air. It did not knock. It arrived like stillness arriving after a bell stops. It arrived like the memory of a name you loved as a child and had not tasted for twenty years. It arrived where his breath ended and his chest began.

I am.

He sat very still and wondered if he had finally done the thing his mother warned him about—worked himself strange. He swallowed and tasted brass.

“I am who?” he asked, almost laughing, because you do not ask wind its surname.

The answer did not elaborate. It did not echo. It simply was—as present and as quiet as a hand on a shoulder.

The universe had always been unreasonably intelligible to him, the way a face is intelligible to a child long before he knows the word mother. He had called that intelligibility a gift without thinking, and now he wondered whether gifts implied a giver or whether he was just dressing gratitude in clumsy grammar.

He walked back inside and touched the warm flank of the machine as if it were a good horse that had done a long day’s work. Quinn looked up from a screen.

“You look as if somebody told you a secret,” she said.

“Maybe,” he said, and poured coffee he did not need. He did not say the thing that was dawning on him in fearsome softness: that if Being itself were personal, then asking why is there anything? might be less like interrogating an equation and more like listening for a voice that had been speaking since the first light, and maybe earlier.

He did not like how this made his throat thick. But he liked even less the alternative—an ache that ends in a shrug.

The third fire came for Elias in a hospital room that smelled of lemon and surrender.

Mara lay in a bed that looked like a machine playing at being furniture. She had been a friend since grad school—the one who made dinners that tasted of herbs and laughter, the one who cried at documentaries about nurses, the one who said “We” when she meant “human beings” and it did not feel like a trick. A year ago she had coughed and everyone had assumed winter. Then there were scans that would not stop spelling bad news. She had lost her hair and then her balance and then the delicious lie of invulnerability.

Elias went every night. He brought small things: the smell of rain on his coat, a story about the neighbor who had painted his fence a desperate blue, a tangerine peeled with theatrical attention that made her snort. He read to her when she asked. Sometimes he said nothing and let the machines count.

“Do you ever think,” she said on a Thursday when the lemon smell was stronger, “that if I am only chemistry, chemistry is too beautiful to be only?”

He didn’t answer right away. He had decided when she got sick to stop being clever. He had decided to give her honesty without the armor of ideas.

“I think sometimes the word ‘only’ is a kind of cruelty,” he said. “As if you could measure Mozart and then say, ‘Only frequencies.’ As if listing the parts could make a whole cheap.”

Her mouth made a soft curve. “You always did love wholes.”

“I always did love you,” he said to the ceiling, because saying it at her felt like asking for something he had no right to ask for.

She laughed the broken laugh that had become theirs. Then she said, “I’m not afraid of not being. I’m afraid of not being loved. Is that silly?”

“No,” he said, and it came out fierce. “No.”

“Then maybe the same one who taught you to run into a fire will run into this,” she said. “Maybe… maybe the door isn’t locked from the outside.”

He wanted to say what door but he knew. She had always been braver than he was about naming metaphors that felt like windows.

The last night arrived without a trumpet. Mara slept in pieces, small islands of calm between weather. He sat and held her hand and told her about the meteor shower he had seen as a child and how he had been sure the sky was opening like a book. He said, “I wish we had gone to the sea again.” She said, without opening her eyes, “We will.”

Then there was a moment the machine marked and he did not need it to. He felt the world tighten, as if reality had been a fitted sheet and someone had pulled. The air became too large.

He had been present at deaths before—the family cat, a grandfather who said “well, then” and was mostly gone already—but this was different. Her absence wasn’t emptiness. It was a contour, like a hand withdrawn from water that keeps the shape for a second before forgetting. He looked at the ceiling and said in a voice that would embarrass him later, “If you are there, I don’t know how to forgive you for leaving it like this.”

No answer came that a microphone would have caught. But something in him did not crumple in the way he had expected, as if a beam had been slid under grief to keep it from flattening the house.

He dreamed that night of a garden that had grown at the bottom of the sea. Flowers waved with the tide like choir robes. A figure walked between them and the water did not trouble his hair. He was not young or old. His hands were marked in a way that made Elias ache. The figure knelt beside a seed that looked like a small, sleeping bird and covered it with sand. “Every seed must fall,” he said without moving his mouth. “But it falls into my hands.”

Elias woke with his face wet and the empty apartment not feeling empty at all. He sat up and said, because there was no point in only thinking it now, “If you are real, you must know I am not good at this.”

He waited. The refrigerator hummed like a tired choir. A distant truck mourned down the hill. He felt ridiculous and tender and very, very alive.

The mirror from that first dream returned unasked, and the light inside it looked back with a patience that hurt because he did not deserve it.


---

Time passed in the way time passes when you have lost something that refuses to leave. Work resumed its habits. The campus geese resumed their war with everybody. Spring shook the trees into white confetti and Elias walked through it feeling both chosen and accused.

He did what he knew how to do: he tested. He made small vows he could keep and tried them on the world. Every morning he stood at his sink and said, “If you are there, teach me to see.” He kept a notebook not of ideas but of obediences—a call returned, a small refusal to speak the easy cruelty, a coin given without pretending it was a sacrifice, the name of a person he was tempted to treat as furniture written down and honored as if it were a psalm.

Nothing exploded. He was not granted the faculty of reading leaves. But the world acquired a texture it had lacked—the way bread is bread and also mercy when someone hands it to you warm.

He met a man in the park who fed the crows and whistled a tune that made the crows tilt their heads and Elias tilt his. He met a child who asked why the sky was so heavy and then said, “It’s like it’s full of waiting,” and Elias almost sat down on the grass and cried because yes, yes. He met a woman who still folded her dead son’s shirts on Saturdays and said, “Don’t pity me. I live between the lion’s teeth and somehow I am not devoured.”

He told Quinn, in a voice like someone confessing a minor crime, that he was praying. She did not flinch.

“How?” she asked, not why.

“Like I am standing in front of a face I cannot see,” he said. “And the face is kinder than I am.”

“Does the face answer?”

“Not in sentences,” he said. “In alignments.”

She nodded as if he’d described a phenomenon she had long suspected. “Maybe reality is the face looking back,” she said. “Maybe we only learned to speak equations so we wouldn’t die of direct attention.”

He laughed and then stopped because the laughter was too close to something else.

They worked. They argued about noise in the data. They drank coffee that tasted like burnt almonds. They went to a lecture about the measure problem and after it Elias wrote in his notebook, I do not trust an infinity that has never loved anything. He did not show it to anyone.


---

One evening in late summer, he walked to the hill above the city where teenagers leave their first names in chalk and old men argue about football with a courtesy that passes for love. The lights of the streets made a honeycomb of sense. Far beyond, the dark outline of the reservoir hinted at a different order—the way water holds the moon like a secret. He thought about the three fires that had brought him here: the house, the desert, the bed where Mara had not been anymore and somehow still was.

He tried to assemble an argument he could hand himself like a folded letter. He told himself about moral intuition and evolutionary stories and why “useful” is not the same as “true.” He told himself about the disconcerting miracle of mathematics mapping the world, how unreasonable it is for reality to fit our frames. He told himself about dying and the scandal of caring, and how grief is ridiculous if we are only a brief coincidence of elements and how nevertheless we care and how perhaps a ridiculous thing can be truer than a neat one.

He ran out of telling. He stood.

“Here is what I know,” he said to the air that did not need his list. “I ran into fire because something in me would have broken if I hadn’t. I keep hearing a voice that is not a hallucination because it does not flatter me; it calls me awake. Death came and still I feel the contour of my friend as if reality remembers her on purpose. And everywhere I turn, the world wears a grammar that looks suspiciously like generosity.”

The city exhaled. A dog barked twice. He felt silly and holy.

“If you are only the face I make for mystery, then I am talking to myself and that is a sadness I don’t know how to carry. If you are there—if you are the ground of the grammar and the giver of the tug and the one who walks gardens at the bottom of the sea—then I will learn to say your name without using it as a weapon.”

He waited. He almost expected theatrics—a warm wind, a tear of cloud. He received instead the exact world: a moth bumbling at his sleeve, the metallic taste that means rain is walking toward town, a little ache behind the eyes that was not grief this time but its cousin—joy catching him unawares and shy about it.

A figure came into view at the bottom of the hill, pushing a squeaking wheelbarrow. Elias watched the way the man’s hands held the handles, not like tools but like the edges of a beloved book. As the figure approached, the wheelbarrow stopped squeaking, as if it remembered something.

“Evening,” the man said. He wore a coat the color of late leaves and a hat like you see in paintings of people who do not care whether you see them.

“Evening,” Elias said.

“Looks like rain,” the man said.

“So they say,” Elias said.

They stood together and looked at the city the way old friends look at photographs. The man set the wheelbarrow down and Elias saw it held a coil of rope and a spade and a little sack of seeds with a picture of a tree printed on it.

“You plant?” Elias asked, because it was easier than asking Who are you.

“I mend,” the man said. “And sometimes I plant so there’s something to mend later. I am sentimental that way.”

They shared the small quiet that belongs to people who know each other without names.

“I lost a friend,” Elias said, surprising himself.

“I know,” the man said with a softness that made Elias’s throat hurt. “She taught you to taste peaches as if they were from the first tree.”

Elias turned his head slowly. “Yes.”

The man looked out over the lights. “I was there when she was born. I will be there when you die.”

“Will you be here,” Elias asked, and he hated the child in his voice, “for the parts in between?”

“I am here,” the man said. “But I am not just here. The here-ness you feel is a courtesy I pay because I like to be specific. I am also the reason there is a here to be.”

“You are the voice,” Elias said. He did not mean to; the words walked out of him on their own legs. “You are the I am.”

The man’s smile was not proud. It was almost embarrassed, like someone caught at a kindness they had hoped to keep quiet. “I am,” he said.

Elias wanted to step back and fall on his face and laugh all at once.

“There are many stories about you,” he managed. “Some of them make you small. Some of them make you cruel. Some of them make you too neat.”

The man tipped his head. “There are many stories about wind, too. People who do not like to be pushed invent reasons to fear a breeze.”

“Why so hidden?” Elias said. “Why not write your name on the sky with those silver ropes?”

The man picked up one of the seeds and rolled it between finger and thumb until it clicked. His hands were marked with scars—not ugly, not loud, simply honest. Something in Elias recognized them with a tenderness that felt borrowed.

“If I arrive like thunder, you kneel because you can’t help it,” the man said. “If I arrive like a gardener, you may love me. I prefer the second, because it lets us be friends.”

Rain began in soft coins.

Elias swallowed. “Do you forgive me,” he asked, “for making reality into a puzzle so I could postpone saying thank you?”

“I do not forgive you,” the man said. Elias flinched. The man smiled. “Because there is nothing to forgive. You could not have studied the grammar if I had not taught you letters. Bring me your puzzles. Bring me your thank you. Bring me your anger when I am quiet in rooms where you want me to sing.”

The rain gentled the dust. Somewhere a child shrieked with the delight of being allowed outside during weather. The man lifted the wheelbarrow handles.

“Will you fix the squeak?” Elias asked, even though it had already stopped.

The man grinned. “It remembers,” he said. “It just forgets, now and then.”

He pushed the barrow up the path. Elias watched him go and felt the three fires inside him banked and warm: the tug toward the good, the voice beneath being, the promise that falling is not the end of seeds.

He stood until the rain made him foolish and went home and wrote on the kitchen board again, this time without erasing:

I saw because seen.
I am because I AM.
Every seed must fall, and every seed is held.

He lived differently. Not spectacularly. Not with the kind of drama that writes itself into songs. He apologized to a colleague without needing to win. He took soup to the woman who folded shirts on Saturdays. He sat with the man in the doorway and did not pretend the coins were a solution. He gave away a coat he had liked too much and discovered that liking something exactly the right amount makes it better. He did not stop loving equations; he loved them more, the way you love a map more after you have walked the land.

Sometimes the mirror returned. Sometimes it did not. Sometimes the voice came like a bell; sometimes like quiet. Sometimes the world felt mechanical and he was tempted to be small. He learned that being tempted to be small is the ordinary human way of protecting oneself from awe. He learned, slowly, how to let awe be frightening without making it into a god that eats.

Years later, a child asked him, “Is the world real or a dream?”

“Yes,” he said, and the child laughed and threw a ball and he threw it back. He wanted to say: It is the kind of dream that can bleed and bake bread and die and stand up again and say your name.

On the anniversary of the fire, he walked past the place where the house had been. A small garden grew there now—municipal kindness, lamb’s ear and lavender, a bench with a plaque. He sat and read the name of a donor who would never know him. He thought about the boy in the dinosaur pajamas and hoped he was reading books with dinosaurs who did not burn. He thought about Mara and the seed at the bottom of the sea. He thought about the man with the wheelbarrow and the way the squeak had stopped as if rusty things could remember grace.

A maple leaf landed upside down on his knee and shivered like a red fish. He turned it over gently. The underside was paler, veined with the intelligence of water.

He whispered, to no one and to the one, “I am grateful to have been asked to love.”

The wind moved through the leaves the way a hand moves through a child’s hair. Somewhere, perhaps on a hill, perhaps beyond hills, a gardener pushed a wheelbarrow that did not complain, and seeds clicked in a sack like small promises.

And if you had stood there with Elias and asked him, like a scientist, “What changed?” he would have said what is true and will remain true when our machines are dust: “The rules did not loosen. The stars did not lower themselves for me. The ground did not warm when I spoke. But the world is no longer furniture. It is a face. And when I do the brave thing, the string inside me does not break.”

He stood and walked into the evening with his hands empty of proofs and full of work. The city’s lights came on one by one like thoughts remembered. The rain had washed the air clean. He breathed it and felt watched—not by a critique but by care.

The last thing he heard before the night closed like a book was a wheel somewhere, very far away, not squeaking at all.",1,1761348358.0,god,0,1.0,False

I never ever post but I am so tired. I know I have a lot to appreciate in the moment, but it's draining to keep up with the same cycle over and over again. And I wake up to that same cycle and I am so tired.   
  
A bit long but background info and about me...is that I'm FGLI, currently halfway through undergrad at an Ivy League college full ride. I have a loving family that can be a bit hard to handle at times. I have a partner. I have friends. I have a dog (though at home). I like dogs. I love cats. I'm allergic to cats. I'm a workaholic. I work 3+ jobs and do clubs and extracurriculars. Some of the jobs allow me to do school work during downtime. One of the shifts are until midnight. I find myself constantly looking for a new experience, a new job. Like an addiction. I go to campus events for fun. I thought I had a lot of interests, but if you ask me now, I need time to think. I'm kind of a hoarder. I like to thrift. I used to like to play sports. I'm bad at tests. Or, many times I don't study enough (as in twice, I have waited last minute to study and overslept and got to the exam late) and accordingly do bad. I hate rain. I love snow. I'm uncertain about my majors and career paths now. I'm not caught up with the news and don't give two shucks about celebrities. It's hard for me to keep track of my days and I always have my calendar open. I don't remember my days. I get stressed often. I use a tracking watch. I lose things often. 

A lot of little things can (or used to) make me happy but I don't have any incredible wants or needs that I'm saving up for. I'm extremely competitive (or used to be) so I used to feel motivated with rewards no matter how small the reward was (but now I don't know). 

I don't have many things I'm incredibly passionate about anymore, nor do I do anything much other than (supposedly) ""locking in"". I pack in my google calendar with all the classes, shifts, events, hangouts and also put in 'study hours' but don't always actually sit down to do the studying. I want to do a lot of things but I don't have enough time or enough energy. I want to do more.   
  
Please give me advice and/or tips with motivation for studying or getting to the next thing. Or, any tips on staying awake (I've tried celsius, celsius makes me fall asleep. I sometimes enjoy coffee with sweet additives like caramel but makes my stomach hurt). Or, some advice that might help me feel less tired or drained.   
Also, I'm curious: what do people do in their free time? What's fun and interesting nowadays? Is there anything worth buying? What are some cute cool things that people like now? I want to want them too. 

Please do not tell me to turn to God or meditate unless that is the one and only advice you can give me.  
  
Thanks! :))))))))))))))

Okay I have had GERD since i was little kid. Sometimes it is extremely bad (especially before period). But month ago.. Damn. Something happened and i have been suffering. 

So, month ago it started and it was terrible for days, i tought it gets better because it always does. I started having pale/yellow/white/light gray stool (happened to me before, but only once now and then). Heartburn is extremely bad, i can't eat. I have upper stomach pain and sometimes i can feel it on my back, neck.. 

I've seen doctor 3 times and they say ""take your meds and try to survive"". I live in Finland and did you know that they don't do gastroscopia while you are sleeping? You have to be awake. And i have been asking them do to that while i am sleeping but they just laugh and say that is not going to happen. 

Situation just keep getting worse. Pale stools, severe heartburn, pain on upper stomach and on my back, hiccups, nasty bile burps, bile keeps coming into my mouth all the time. I cough a lot. 

Blood tests were great, ASAT was little bit high. I've had slight fever sometimes. 

I am going to DIE. Doctors don't take me seriously. What should i do? I've done everything. I eat well (GERD diet foods), small amounts. I dont drink coffee or alcohol. I can't even take tylenol without having severe upper stomach pain.

I feel weak. I am in pain. I am extremely tired. I dont want to go to emergency room to sit for hours and go back home after doctors have been laughing at me. Okay I will go if I really need to but damn.. I am scared. ",2,1761348153.0,GERD,2,1.0,False
1ofcix8,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ofcix8/psychologist_for_these_twelve_kids_and_something/,"Psychologist for these twelve kids, and something is wrong.","I know I probably shouldn't be writing this, I'm a  psychologist for crists sake I could lose my job… But I just need help, these people- the kids, this is something I was never trained to help with.

So my work dosn't find this and well… Fire me, I will be calling the place where I work Leap Frog, the name will make sense later. 

The Leap Frog Psychiatric Hospital was started probably ten years ago, I've been working there for five. Got the job just three months out of collage… I know that's a little weird, and honestly it was to me too, no experience and yet a job like this right on my doorstep. I took it though, and for the past five years, things have been normal….

Really normal, until they were admitted.

The way Leap Frog works is that it is both a high and low acutiy crisis facility, but both are kept in the two buildings on the compound. I am assigned to the high crisis facility, and most of the patients I work with have childhood trauma that has caused significant harm, some kind of histeria, or halucinations. Now the twelve patients I am working with show the same symptoms, I just- they're so different than anybody I've worked with before.

Leap Frog assigns their doctors and staff to a certain floor, I am assigned to floor three. Each floor has a capacity of probably over two hunderd patients, each wing of the floor holds twelve patients… So here I am, working with these twelve and questioning why the hell I am even writing this. I should probably stop, but I just- maybe the internet will understand what the heck is going on with these kids…

I'm just gonna stop being an antsy child right now, and get into them.

none of the names I'm gonna use are the kids real names, I don't wanna get them hurt so I'm just gonna use codenames for all of them.



The first patient is a twin with the second, so I'll just describe them together. Patient one I call Star, and the Second Millie. Star has some kind of anxiety disorder, as well as another I can't quite tell what it is. He acted different on both of the days I've met with him, almost like he was two diferent people… While I'm not 100% sure, I just know something was different about him… But I'll have to talk to him more to truly tell, as I've only met him twice and seen him in passing sometimes.

His twin Millie is an odd story, she also probably has an anxiety disorder like her brother,but other than that she seems completely fine. Maybe it's beacuse I haven't spent enough time with her, but she doesn't seem like a kid that would have any reason to be here. I spoke to her and she never reported having any panic attacks, or anything alike… But something is off about her, like I can't tell why she's here, just that she needs to be.

The third patient I'll call Ember, mainly because of the fact that he's a diagnosed pyromainac, and his records (what little I have been given of them strangely) suggest he set many fires in his childhood home. Ember seems to just enjoy the warmth and the sensation of watching things burn, I think he uses it as some kind of stress releaver, but it appears to be a kind of taught behavior as he recalls it as a lesson rather than an instinct. 

This is where I will get into the fact that the twelve kids in this wing have little to no paperwork or records. This hit me as odd, due to the fact that the few bits we do have are just strange in comparison. All of the kids (except Dew who'll I'll get to latter) have very very minimal paperwork, most have their birthdays which we can work backwords to find their ages from, and some of their previous residences. 

Though any records of education or family history has been scrubbed clean.



Moving on, patient four is chameleon. I call them this because they love to sneak around and escape the doctors and nurses. Chameleon seems to hate being alone in a room with just adults, so they often insist on bringing Star or Ember with them as they feel close to the two. Cameleon beyond that is an enigma to me, they don't talk much or at all, and when they do they just repeat ""Praise the father, Praise the Lord.""

The fifth patient I will call Dew, and to put it bluntly…

He is petrified of water.

Ironic that I gave him that name, but I can explain… Dew hates water, like he will not drink or go ten feet within water unless forced too. Though there is one kind of water he is drawn to, almost like a moth to a flame. 

Rain, 

and by extension.

Morning dew.

The morning I met Dew, it was raining- like cats and dogs pouring. He was pushed up against the window of his room, and was watching the rain intensely. His roommate who I'll talk about in a second said he had been acting that way for years ever since he had experianced time with 'the father.' I still have no idea who this 'father' is, I think it might be the same pesron Chameleon was talking about, as everybody in this wing arrived together.

Regardless Dew was hard to pull away from the rain. 

The weird thing was his hair was damp, almost as if he had actually been outside which was impossible. Dew never willingly went near water, and there was no way he could have gotten out of the institute, or opened the window due to the numerous locks put on them. I'm still trying to figure out what happened, but he is giving no answers. 

Now onto the next strange thing about Dew, as stated earlier he has no records. At. All.

It would be one thing if his parents had just never filled out the paperwork or anything, but when we asked him about his parents he never recalled having any. When we asked him who raised him, he said the 'comune' did. We do however have an actual age for Dew, which we rangled out of him after a lot of questions… Dew said the last somebody had told him he was eight. Dew dosen't look eight, or even nine… Dew looks like he's probably six, but acts double his age. The working theory for me at least was that Dew was exposed to some kind of punishment via water leading to hydrophobia, and that the kid had to raise himself. I don't know how close I am, so I'd like some opinions from all of you. Let me know if you have any theories.

Anyways I'm gonna talk about patient six, since I think she's one of the stranger of the patients. Stitch, is what I would call the definition of a Hikikomori. She shared a room with Millie which would make you think she has some social interaction. But by talking to Millie, I learned Stitch doesn't talk to her or to anybody. Nurses and myself have been met with science, and she ignored us when we come in. Now I know hikikomoris typically have total iccolation, but since Stitch isn't able to do that, she keeps the dividers that we use to give the patients some privacy closed off from her area. 

I call the kid Stitch because that's all she watches. Lilio and Stitch, won't touch the TV if it's not on, and only draws in a coloring book that contains Lilio and Stitch drawings. All of them are filled in, but she makes each of the drawings more and more realistic as she got access to a twenty four pack of markers. 

She's an odd kid, one I check in with every day. (seven times so far.) 

The next kid Lion is fairly 'normal' compared to the oddities of the others. He has depression and has Seperation Anxiety Disorder, Lion hates being away from me or his roommate, Dew. Lion seems to know Dew like the back of his hand, and Dew his. Lion makes sure there's no water that will scare Dew, and Dew nevere leaves Lion's side. The two are basically glued at the hip, if you get one you get the other. 

Lion dosn't talk about what him and Dew have been through, just that the two of them had known each other for a very long time. (which is strange considering their ages) Lion is fourteen, and acts consistently like an older brother to Dew. Lion also takes care of Chameleon and has tried to contact Stitch to no avail. Overall I consider him to be the big brother and protector of the group.

Patient seven I refer to as 'Veil.' Veil is an odd kid, (Well all of them are odd, but you know what I mean) she is quiet, not silent… just whenever nobody's talking there's always and uncomfortable silence around her. Veil speaks Korean mainly, only one of the three times I've met with her she's spoken any kind of English. Though all my questions are in English, she answers in Korean as previously stated. 

Veil is the oldest of all the kids in this institution, she's fifteen. She acts older though, I'd say about seventeen. Alongside Lion, Veil acts as the main protector of the group. Veil often is never alone, she likes traveling with groups but won't have  a meltdown like Lion if she is left alone. 

Veil from what I have observed also has some kind of auditory proscessing disorder. While I can't speak Korean, my co-worker Lexi can. She told me that several times that Veil misheard words or had a hard time understanding her. 

Anyways this is all to say that Veil is very much like Millie in that she shows no signs of needing to be here, but she just is. Veil as far as I can tell is perfectly mentally healthy, maybe a tad bit of anxiety, but she's normal…

The next kid in the hall is Veil's roommate, who I call Vigil. Vilgil has insomnia, hence the name . Also I'm convinced he can see in the dark. Since I work pretty late, I often am around in the later hours typically three pm to twelve am, and I check on Vigil to make sure he's asleep.  He's  never been asleep so far on my visits. 

Vigil hasn't slept basically at all upon arriving in the past week. He slept a bit last Wednesday (I'm writing this on my day off on a Sunday) and some on Friday, but not much other than that. I don't know how that kid's body is still running, I need to be up and doing things with at least eight hours of sleep everyday. (Not that I really even get that with my other job)

Anyways moving on, the ninth patient's name is JJ. She's a big talker! JJ talks the most out of all the other kids, but the other doctors and nurses say she doesn't talk to them at all… I guess she just really likes me? Not sure though.

JJ is the kid I have the most information from, as she has talked quite a bit about her life. JJ is thirteen and her birthday is actually coming up fairly soon! (If I post another update I'll tell you guys how it went!) JJ says her Mom is probably looking for her, but said nothing when I asked about her dad.

JJ also gave a bunch of details when I asked about the other kids! She was the one to actually tell me that all twelve of them knew each other before coming to the ward. She was also the one to clarify some things about ""the father."" Basically all these kids had this father figure I guess, they didn't grow up with their own dads, just this one.

JJ confirmed to me that none of them are siblings, (Except Star and Millie who are twins) just that they all call him that. The kid is really bright, they said they were the first to 'realize' but never explained it. JJ said all of those who learn are lost to the Father… or something like that. 

I didn't get to talk to her after friday, so hopefully when I go in tommorow I can ask her a few more things. (and maybe like record them like a jornalist I hope.)

Kid number ten I nicknamed Orange, and I'll pair them with the next kid Apple since they're always together. Orange is very reserved, but peppy when you get to know them… or at leats that's what Apple says. Orange is the troublemaker of the dozen. They've started two fights already, (One with Ember, and one withVigil) and JJ says they get on her nerves a lot. Apple typically calms Orange down. 

Apple says that Orange's episodes are the dispelling of Sin and the excising of the will of the Lord. 

Look… I didn't grow up Cristian. Hell I haven't touched a bible a day in my life- but this… 

At least I know God shouldn't hurt us.

So who the actual fuck taught a kid to preach like that.





For my sake and yours I'm goingn to move on before discussing Apple a bit more.

The last kid I'll call Coffee. 

He- him and Apple are the reasons I'm turning for help. 

I know places like this have had stories similar to this. So I just need any help, and sure it's probably gonna end in failure, but at least maybe I'll get something out of it.


So here goes.



Coffee and Apple pray once an hour everyday, even if it's 3am. (Okay they do pass out before then according to Lexi, but you get the point.) Anyways… I don't know how they do it… but Coffee has cuts and marks… fresh ones… they shoudln't have access to anything like that, I checked… five times.

Coffee's scars have stayed red for longer than they should, (we don't really know when he got them but we think he's had them for at least a week or two before coming to LeapFrog) and Apple's have fadeded a bright white. It's not normal, we contacted a hospital, and they said they'd check it out four days ago… We've had radio silence since then. 

Like from all phone lines.

I called my mom from work, no reply.

Dad… Nothing.

Actually for my dad I got what sounded like a scrambled version of his voice, but I'm not sure… I only heard it for a few seconds, but I don't know.

It was fine once I left the facility though…

So I guess that's why I'm making this.

I don't know if some cosmic entity or divine intervention has entered the facility, just that something is wrong. 

I appologize if my grammar is bad, or if my spelling is off, I'm up at four am writting this because I can't be damned to go back to sleep.  Also I got a degree in people's brains, not in how they write things…

Even tho I rode my motorcycle there so I couldn’t have even done that. Then she calls when she got off work and mentioned how I didn’t appreciate what she did last night even tho I’ve told her since last night how beautiful I thought she looked and how much I liked it. Then went off about the coffee again . She then said she’s not having sex with me because of this for awhile. That’s where I got upset because I’m tired of her pettiness and that’s a prime example of what she does when she’s mad. I left to get her a coffee after that and she called saying that if I didn’t come back I had to leave her house right after that she kicked me out because I went out to my truck because her cats wouldn’t stop meowing and was aggravating me.

I am 5'1, SW 130 in May, CW 120. I would want to lose a couple more lbs but I don't think it's worth it. I'm so tired of controlling my food, constantly hungry, constantly tired, and prone to binging. Today I ate a bowl of unflavored whey isolate protein powder with Stevia and water and savored it like it was candy. I'm down bad. Every time I'm eating I'm actively planning out my next meal. I have to go on multiple walks a day just to not eat. I chew like 6 pieces of gum and drink at least 3 coffees and a gallon of water a day. And I still go to bed hungry and wake up hungry. My weight hasn't changed in over a month. I'm a healthy weight, I'm done.

I've been reading up on intuitive eating, where you basically just eat until you're full (but not stuffed) and apparently it gives you more freedom with food and from food noise. But it doesn't seem possible? I always think about food. I assume if I truly just ate everything I wanted I'd rapidly gain weight, because my appetite tells me to eat approximately 3000 calories a day (I've tracked on enough bad days and ""cheat"" days to feel very confident in this number).

So what? Am I just doomed to track and restrict forever?

1ofcc67,https://www.reddit.com/r/PregnancyUK/comments/1ofcc67/setting_boundaries_for_visits/,Setting boundaries for visits,"Im 34 weeks pregnant and trying to discuss boundaries with my husband in preparation as don't want added stress. Baby is due December and im already worrying about the visits. 

Im very private and live on same street as my family so see them daily. My mum will help with shopping. Washing, make me dinner and go on dog walks with me etc so we spend a lot of busy time together. 

My husband family is fairly different they've watched as we moved and never offered a helping hand but often expect it back. We will get a text for them to drop in for a coffee and then moan when we say no as we are busy. I have 2 rescue dogs who don't like visitors so I will always suggest seeing them out. They say our house is like fort knoxs and always make digs they won't be invited round or won't even see the baby. When struggling with a first failed round of ivf his mum actually did not consider our feeling and moaned about how she would never see her grand child anyways. 

We do get along fine but these are just some things that really bother me and they just have a different way to myself and my family. I feel it's selfish approach and struggle to consider others. For example. His mum is very active on social media and hates we've not posted a baby announcement as she wants to post it. Weve started tslking abojt social media boundaries but she didnt really listen and said its not fair as it will look like she posts and loves her other grand child more. Surely she shouls worry more about us than what distant friends on facebook think. We are always left out of family gatherings too. Never been invited for Christmas. 

I know this year will be different as it will be babys first christmas and it will be an expectation to see them but I can't help but think we've never been invited in the past so why should I prioritise them? 

After 5 years of infertility and ivf I want to protect our baby bubble from visitors and I know this won't go down well. Ive suggested it to my husband and he agrees but says we obviously need to let me visit every week of we will end up falling out with them. I can't bare the thought of hosting now let alone post partem and it's definitely the case of coming round to hold baby there will never been any offers of helping to clean or bringing shopping etc. 

What's everyone else's boundaries been. Would I be unfair to let her meet him once then go into my bubble for a while until I'm ready. I also don't want my christmas to be consumed by working around them and their plans as we've not had an invite before. How can I deal with this and set the expectations. 

My sil had a baby in summer so will be both grand childrens first christmas and I know it's all about getting matching outfits to photos together. I know it's nice gesture but I'm just not interested. Ive seen how full on she can be with her other grand child and it's making me cringe constantly taking baby off her or taking his dummy out or moving him when not needed.

I stopped at a local coffee shop near Santa Barbara which was my turn around spot.  A woman in the coffee shop started to chat with me and shared that she struggled with mental health.  She was at the coffee shop with a friend of hers and we chatted for about 10 minutes and she asked me what I could share as a bit of life advice.  I shared my thoughts as well as some of the obstacles that I have faced in my life that have helped shape me.  More than once she mentioned mental health struggles.  She had a job, a home and a friendly she was just being open with me and in those 10 minutes that we talked I too opened up to her.  She and her friend had their order and I went to the back patio and had mine but I was touched by the conversation.  When I went to leave I couldn't find her and her friend.  I was going to give her a hug and let her know that their is still compassion in this world and that we all have our struggles.

*Lastly, this isn't exactly an open interaction post per se, but feel free to visit Ith'Raal's office to make a deal/yell at him, or ping* u/ProfessionalGreen906 *to talk to Arach post-negotiations. This deal is NOT public knowledge!* *</rw>*

*...*

**""Greetings, Arach!""** *In what is somehow the* ***least*** *convenient timing, a spectacle of flames and foreboding classical music abruptly welcomes Arach to Ith's office.* **""Did you miss me?""**

\[“—Well at least I’m not as bad a mother as **you**! You impulsive little elven slu—“\]

*Arach is brought into the office during what was clearly some form of argument. One which she was so caught up in that at first she doesn’t even realize the difference in her surroundings, or the lack of the person she was arguing with. She cuts herself off as she finally notices the change of environment, looking around the room before her gaze settles on the Devil before her.*

\[“Oh, hello Ith’Raal. Somehow, *this* is more preferable to where I was before. But also, don’t disrupt me like that again... Why am I here?”\]

**""Oh dear! Looks to me like you're a little busy! Is this a bad time..?""** *He snaps his fingers, summoning a chair for Arach and a coffee for himself.*

*He continues,* **""Because... I really could** ***not*** **care less. 'Why am I here?', you ask. Well... Congratulations! You broke a contract!""** *He smiles.* **""And I believe I was quite clear about the consequences for breaking a contract...""**

*Arach drops back into the chair and crosses one leg over the other.*

\[“Broke our contract? I haven’t the faintest recollection of what you could possibly be talking of. I’ve been following it To The Letter this entire time. I have the documents and release waivers to prove it.”\]

*She reaches across the desk to snatch Ith’Raal’s coffee for herself. Then takes a long, loud sip as she stares into the devil’s eyes. Her expression contorts the moment she actually tastes the coffee. It takes her a moment to recover before she drops the cup onto the ground, shattering it.*

\[“That tastes terrible, did you actually intend to drink that rancid garbage? Did you add something into it, or is that what all coffee tastes like?”\]

*The whole display is an impulsive, poorly veiled, and vain attempt by Arach to derail the conversation to anything other than the contract. Plus she just couldn’t waste the opportunity to be a pain.*

*He chuckles at the pathetic attempt to upset him, resting his chin on his hand.* **""Wonderful, isn't it? I believe that was a blend of 'existential listlessness and yearning'. Made it myself!""**

*He snaps his fingers again, summoning another mug.*

**""Listen, can I be honest with you for a sec, Arach? So here's the thing... You haven't** ***really*** **breached the contract yet. I lied! Hilarious, right? You should've seen your** ***face!*** **But you are on thin... fucking... ice. It'd be a walk in the** ***park*** **to take you to court and get your memories.""** *He leans back in his chair.* **""But I don't want to be like that... I have a reputation to uphold. So... let's just make a deal instead. I'll let your little 'experiments' slide, but only if you can offer me something in return. That sounds fair, doesn't it?""**

*Normally, Arach would refuse.* ***Normally****, she’d take such an offer as the highest of insults and storm out of the room. However, the introduction of  Arach’s mother back into her life has made her far more exhausted than she ever would have thought. And she just doesn’t have the energy to disagree.*

\[“Fine, fair enough… for a hellspawn. But what exactly would you want? I’m not exactly *familiar* with your interests or likes. I suppose I could do favors. Only ones that I agree to, of course. I’m **not** about to sign myself up to do **anything** you want, no questions asked.”\]

**""Well, let's see...""** *He taps his claws on the desk.* **""Memories, of course. But that'd defeat the whole point. Your** ***soul*** **would be nice, but I doubt you even** ***have*** **one. And to be entirely honest, I don't care about** ***money.*****""**

**""...I like where your head's at with the favor idea.""** *He takes a sip of his 'Eternal pain and suffering' flavored coffee.* **""I'd let you put in your restrictions, of course, but only** ***one*** **favor seems... limiting. After all, you just** ***keep*** **skating around on such** ***thin*** **ice... I don't want you to pay it off all at** ***once.*** **I want it to be... like a subscription service. But for favors. Four favors per month! How about that?""**

*Arach smirks as she leans further back into the chair. After all, favors are easy. A nice little break from the monotony of usual life even, and she had been wanting an entrance into hell related affairs for a while now. This could be a mutually beneficial situation… if she plays it right.*

\[“Why limit it to only four? I would be willing to remove a maximum amount of favors, so long as a few of my own conditions are met.”\]

*Arach summons a crystal wine glass into one of her hands. Its contents are a mysterious grey and brown sludge the consistency of tar and which emits an aroma of rotten fruit.*

*\[*“First, I would get to decline any favor I don’t like. That’s so you can’t loophole your way through the second requirement that I get to make restrictions on what the favors pertain to. Just as some ground rules, I won’t have to do any favors which: would require me to harm myself, would near certainly lead to my injury or to me making new enemies, would lead to an end result that goes against my own interests, would in any way involve my family, and or would result in general uncontrollable and widespread chaos. With an asterisk on that last restriction that lets it happen so long as I would find the chaos funny or entertaining.""\]

*At this point, Ith already begins to mentally tune out. But Arach continues*.

\[""Oh, and lastly I would like to know the full context around any favors I’m doing before I agree to them. That’s mostly just because I like gossip. Sound good?”\]

*Ith laughs. For too long. Crazy bastard.*

**""Denied on all fronts. You're not exactly in a position to bargain, Arach. If I let you decline any favor you didn't like, you'd just keep declining them** ***forever.*** **I won't ask you to physically harm yourself, nor will I ask you to do anything that'd break your current contract. You get no context for the favor I ask of you unless I** ***reeeeeally*** **feel like telling you. It's only four favors per month. Roughly one per week. Easy enough, right?""**

*He smiles in a way that implies it would not, in fact, be 'easy enough'. Arach grimaces.*

\[“I forget you’re not an *idiot* like most of the people I deal with. Those dumbasses would hear unlimited favors, get excited, catch the whole declining part, feel all good about themselves, and then take whatever placation I offer while the other loopholes sneak through.”\]

*She chuckles to herself as she takes another sip of her concoction.*

\[“But even if you aren’t an idiot, I’m not one either. You’re sitting here, acting like you have a case against me. Like you have a gun to my head and a knife to my back. But you don’t. I haven’t violated the rules of our contract. You said so yourself, Im just on thin ice. Now, that may be worrying if I was a brute such as yourself, but I’m a spider. I can walk on far more fragile things without falling through.”\]

\[“And while I can’t imagine hell cares about extortion, that is still what you’re doing. So what I can imagine is that they won’t care to help you if I put up a fuss or even refuse this little deal. You’d be back where we started, needing to prove I broke a contract that I’ve been following to the letter. I have plenty of room to bargain here. I just don’t have the usual room to threaten.”\]

*She drops her glass to the ground, the liquid within sizzling as it spreads slowly across the floor.*

\[“I can admit my demands were a bit much though. So how about this? We keep the restrictions about harm to myself, anything to do with my family, and going against my interests. After all, you did offer for me to have some restrictions. So it shouldn’t be a problem. So long as the favors fit those restrictions I can’t refuse them. I suppose I do have to acquiesce on demanding context. But I do want gossip, and I want to be aware of what’s going on in hell. Just in general. It interests me, and I lack a source of news about it. Is this deal weighted enough in your favor now? Or are you going to keep up the scary devil act that I don’t have a choice?”\]

**""We'll go with option number two! The scary devil act!""** *He finishes drinking his coffee.* **""That 'against my interests' line is still** ***far*** **too vague. Veto'd, no negotiation. And we'll say 'family' only counts for... two degrees of separation. Grandparents, first cousins 0 times removed, children, grandchildren, aunts and uncles... You get the idea.""**

*Ith'Raal continues,* **""You want gossip? I'll tell you. But I won't make it a contractual obligation on my part. The less we need to wrap this whole thing up in bureaucracy, the better. Even if you** ***do*** **have a case, do you have the time to fight it? Do you have the resources to hire a competent** ***hell-lawyer?*** **It's not just about winning the case. Even if I lose the case, you'll never win the** ***game.*****""**

**""Just take the deal, Arach. Neither of us have time for this pedantry.""**

*Arach sighs, she had wanted to draw this out.*

\[“Fine, I suppose you have things to do. And I suppose I do too, even if I’d rather avoid them.”\]

*Arach looks off into the distance, thinking about something in silence. It lasts for an uncomfortable amount of time before she snaps back to the conversation.*

\[“Anyway! Sounds like we have a deal. And don’t misunderstand, I have near limitless resources to fight whatever legal battle I want. I just like you Ith, even if you are an utter pain. At least you don’t delude yourself into thinking you’re a good person. I mean, from what I’ve seen, the only person you actually care about is someone you murdered. An ex you’re still not over. I wonder if you just like hurting people because it feels familiar, maybe it’s just your nature to be a monster. Or is it something else, something a bit more personal?”\]

*Arach’s gaze falls on the empty coffee cup.*

\[“I mean, I’m no expert but I don’t think it’s exactly normal for devils to inflict the suffering they cause back onto themselves. You lot are usually more about debauchery than masochism. Maybe you just drink that to make yourself seem more threatening? But that wouldn’t make any sense, after all most other people would never even know that was anything different from normal coffee? Or maybe you’re just so used to the feelings in that cup that you feel at home when you consume it? What did you say that coffee was flavored as again? ‘Existential listlessness and yearning’?  That’s awfully telling, wouldn’t you say? I mean, like you just admitted. This whole scary devil thing is an act, isn’t it?”\]

*Arach’s face is trained into a perfect insidious smile.*

\[“Maybe I’m just making connections where there aren’t any. But I don’t feel like I am. You don’t mind my prying though, right?”\]

**""*****Fascinating...*** **You know, you're not the first to think that. To think there's** ***something*** **behind** ***this*****,""** *he gestures to his face,* **""because I was a mortal like you. They think – they** ***hope*** **– this 'devil' thing is an act. They're desperate for some** ***shred*** **of humanity in my heart that can feel** ***something*** **for them...""**

*He chuckles.* **""...I usually learn that after I eat their memories. That's... what the coffee is, just so you're aware. It's always just so** ***funny*** **to watch them squirm... Kinda like you're doing right now, actually. Do you project often? Because... for pretending to be this big bad spider, you're really** ***quite*** **pathetic. You're afraid of losing control, just like you did today...""**

*Arach chuckles. Though it’s only half genuine, there’s an unspoken hostility in her posture. Not fear or nerves, just seething anger.*

\[“Oh no, it seems we’ve both misinterpreted the other. I wasn’t trying to elicit pity. I was just making an observation… Wait, no. What am I doing here? You’re a devil, I don’t have to pretend I’m playing nice! I mean, I wasn’t trying to elicit pity. I'm smart enough to know that would never work. I was ***trying*** to make you feel bad by ripping up any potential insecurity I could get my hands on. I just misread your actions as having different reasoning behind them than they do. And if I can be honest, I had no clue you used to be a mortal. Not sure when I was supposed to have learned that.”\]

*Arach’s hand moves up to rest on Ith’s desk. Her claws gouging into the wood as she drags her hand back toward her. She doesn’t acknowledge the action as she continues speaking, acting as if she hadn’t done anything at all.*

\[“Oh, and I suppose I should also address your little observation. The fact that my whole *thing* is all an act and deep down I’m insecure and paranoid isn’t exactly some breakthrough discovery. Most people are just too caught up with the immorality of my actions to notice the motivations behind them. I mean, it’s not like I hide it, I’m pretty damn open with it. So congrats, you did what most people can’t and noticed a surface level characteristic of a person other than yourself. You deserve a ribbon or something.”\]

*She stands up from her chair and walks around the office to stretch her legs as she continues to speak.*

\[“As for the deal. I have one last *little* thing to include. The contract that gives you any leverage over me is based on a treaty, said treaty has an expiration date. So, the moment that treaty expires, so does this deal. I’m not giving you indefinite power over me. I may not despise you in the same way I do most people, but you are still not someone I like being around.”\]

*The clawing of the desk... That* ***painful*** *noise the wood made as it was ruined... It's hard for him to resist the urge to pin her hand to the table with a letter opener, but he manages to keep himself composed.*

**""I'm not exactly a closed book about these things. Saying I'm mortal usually humanizes me to my clients. Helps deals go smoother, you know? And thank you, I** ***do*** **deserve a ribbon. I'm the best one here!""**

*Don't stab Arach. Don't stab Arach. Don't stab Arach. Don't stab Arach. Oh look, another potential loophole! Think about that instead!*

**""Oh, one last thing... Let's just say no time shenanigans. I don't want to hear about you living out your life in another plane where time moves faster relative to here. So... we'll go with** ***my*** **perception of time if you're moving slower relative to me, and** ***your*** **perception if you're moving faster. Don't try to loophole it, you'll just make it worse for yourself. One year expiry. 48 favors if you don't mess with time, and... probably a LOT more if you do.""**

*God, he hates chronomancy... Always screwing up deals with time-based agreements.*

**""Do we have a deal?""**

*She paces around the room as she thinks out the  discussed details of the deal audibly. Mulling it over in her head one last time.*

\[“48 favors total, portioned out at 4 per month. The amount is liable to increase if I do time shenanigans. That’s pretty reasonable, especially since I prefer torpor over time stuff. I didn’t get all the restrictions I wanted but I did get that no favors would involve harm coming to me, me breaking the previous contract, or in any way involve my family. Only two degrees of separation for family members, but it’s not like I have any family more than one degree anyway, still good for unforeseen scenarios. I didn’t get my loopholes through but I didn’t really expect to in the first place. I get gossip, just as an unofficial part of the deal. I won’t get all the context to favors but I will get it if it’s important to me doing it right which is fair. Yeah, this seems good, considering this is a deal I don’t really get a choice for.”\]

*Arach walks back over to the desk just to slam her hands down on the wooden surface. She puts on a massive grin as the sound of splintering wood fills the room. She leans down deeply enough to be eye level with the devil.*

*The magic she uses to suppress the uncanny truth of her appearance falters as she ceases to maintain it. The leathery paths where her exoskeleton parts to allow more fluid movement reveal themselves. Bright orange fault lines of exposed scar tissue caused from countless grafts and reckless self experimentation run across her face and body like lava flows. Fields of thick, hair-like setae are spread around her body in patches, some of which even poke out through the fabric of her outfit. The former symmetric presentation she held is abandoned to reveal her true patchwork form. Arach stares down the devil, waiting to see how he’ll react. Wondering if there are any remnants of mortal instinct deep down in his mind, some instinctual fear screaming within him at the sight of her. Or maybe he’s already lost every last shred of whatever he used to be. Either way, she’s dragged this out long enough to be satisfied.*

\[“I’m satisfied with the rules we’ve laid out. It’s a deal then.”\]

*Ith has no reaction to the display. He shakes his head in disappointment, maintaining full eye contact.*

**""Arach, I've already seen your hideousness before. I just try not to judge on appearances. That's Pride's job. I'm from** ***Violence,*** **don't you remember?""**

*And to be fair, Ith isn't exactly nice on the eyes under the surface either.*

**""...Just sign this thing already.""**

*Arach sighs.*

\[“You’re no fun.”\]

*She snatches up the contract then twists around to sit on the desk as she reads it over. Arach is disappointed to find that 'Favors related to family' is defined as being* ***directly*** *related. No loopholes of 'everything is technically related to her family'. However, aside from that, once satisfied that the contract doesn’t have any clauses or rules snuck in at the last moment, Arach signs it and slams it down in front of Ith.*

\[“There. Now if you don’t mind I have an argument to get back to. So I’m just going to leave.”\]

*The contract dissolves in a display of flames.* **""What do you** ***mean*** **I'm no fun? I'm actually having a** ***lot*** **of fun, I'll have you know. Speaking of fun, have fun arguing with your mother, Arach! I hear she's a** ***wonderful*** **person.""**

*He snaps his fingers for the last time, opening a gateway back to where Arach was arguing.*

**""Goodbye Arach. I'll be seeing you...""**

*Arach grumbles under her breath as she walks towards the gateway back to her home. She doesn’t bother to speak whatever she’s thinking out loud though. Her illusory guise flickers back over her, obstructing most of her more grotesque features and returning her to the presentable look she had when she entered. And with that, she takes her leave through the portal.*",9,1761347555.0,wizardposting,1,0.91,False

1ofc9pt,https://schooloffaith.com/daily-rosary-meditations,Holy Family Daily Rosary Meditations,"Here once again to recommend to you the Holy Family School of Faith Daily Rosary Meditations. From a FAQ on their website:

Why don’t you pray the regular mysteries (Joyful, Sorrowful, Luminous, and Glorious)?

Answer: The Rosary does have its own form that has developed through the centuries, and ordinarily one does “announce” the mystery before beginning the decade. However, the overarching essence of the Rosary is that it is an exquisitely contemplative prayer, even though it is accompanied by repetitive vocal prayer. The idea is that as we say the Hail Mary we place ourselves in the company of our Mother and with her we contemplate the face of her Son in the context of the various Christian mysteries.

From the earliest days of the Church, the faithful had the habit of praying a series of Our Fathers and Hail Marys. But under the inspiration of Our Lady, Saint Dominic was unique in the way he used the Rosary as a powerful tool of evangelization in the 12th century. 

Dominic went into villages, gathered people, and shared with them the life of Christ. After a short instruction on the faith, he would recite ten Hail Marys with those gathered. As Mary promised, it proved to be a most fruitful form of preaching. Furthermore, Mary said this method would be one of the most powerful weapons against future errors and in future difficulties. 

Our Lady is calling us here at Holy Family School of Faith to use the same method.

We invite family and friends to join us in our homes, offer hospitality, a meal, drinks, coffee, dessert, engage in good conversation, and then invite them to pray the Rosary with us. 

We pray the Rosary in a new way that is actually a really old way introduced by St. Dominic. We share a short teaching from the Word of God, the teaching of Jesus, and then we pray one decade of the Rosary – and we do this five times. Then, the conversation can continue by asking one another what struck us during the meditations.  

It worked for St. Dominic and Our Lady promised it would work in the future.

I’m looking to connect with someone in or near Miami who’s active in wholesale real estate and open to exchanging information or guidance.

I’m not interested in buying any courses. So, if that’s you, please ignore. Just hoping to connect with someone local who’s actually doing deals and willing to share some insight and let me learn from experience. I’m willing to assist in making you money with “boots on the ground” and learning the ropes. 

A bit about me: I’ve spent several years in luxury retail sales, and I’m confident the relationship-building and negotiation side of that work will transfer well into real estate. I’ve been doing my own research for a few months now — contracts, laws, and marketing strategies — but I’m ready to start putting it into action and could really use some direction from someone who’s been through the process.

1ofc8mj,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ofc8mj/aitah_for_throwing_away_an_8_year_relationship/,AITAH for throwing away an 8 year relationship?,"I(27f) have been with my(33m) fiance for 8 years(just 2 weeks shy of 8 years). Things were great when we first got together, the honeymoon faze was real, without getting into too many details, our relationship was formed around our sexual kinks. We had been through a lot together within the first year of our relationship, and about 1.5 years in I became pregnant. This pregnancy nearly killed me, and that's not being dramatic, I had to get IVs multiple times a week because I couldn't even drink water without vomiting profusely(this will be important later). Due to medical complications, I had to have a C-section to deliver my son to ensure the safety of both of us... For some context before I get into it anymore, his family has VERY conservative views on women in general... While healing, his family pushed me to do things my doctor's told me not like all the laundry, cooking, and cleaning the entire house, shampooing the carpets and all. They pushed me to do all of that the very same day I left the hospital with our son, they pushed it so much I had torn my incision and had to go to the ER to have them stitch me up again. Unfortunately, we were living with his family at the time so I had no choice if we didn't want to end up on the streets... But not once did he stick up for me, offer to help when he got home from work, or even bother to bring up these concerns with his family(I had a couple times, but since I wasn't working, they would literally shoo me when talking about anything important)... Now to the main issue... We moved into a new apartment 2 years ago and I felt free enough to be open with my husband about some personal stuff(we were never legally married, but we called each other husband and wife). i had begun to notice that our emotional connection was dwindling, and brought things up as casually and respectfully as possible as to not make him feel like I was attacking him, but he took it that way anyway. I told him that I felt like all he wanted was sex, but I needed more than sex right now. He took that to the furthest extreme and decided ""oh, she doesn't want me to touch her the way I want, so I'm not going to touch her anymore"" and he stood by that. He'd go weeks, if not months without physically touching me, no matter how many times I told him his touch is all I want and the sexual fulfilment would come side by side with the emotional fulfilment. But still nothing changed, in fact they got worse. I understand that he felt rejected by me every time I told him I didn't ""want to hump""(literally the words he'd use every time he wanted to get frisky), and in order to combat that rejection, he started using one of my kinks as his own personal loophole... This kink being, I enjoy being woken up with the act 😐... So he would use that kink because ""I couldn't tell him no""(also his words). So this fed into my depression, this feeling of not being loved, the feeling of only being good for one thing. I brought it up, time and time again, sometimes calmly, sometimes begging to be heard, but it always ended with me in tears agreeing to give in to him more... The entire time, I'd been doing the good wife things like taking care of the house, our son, our bills, all of our doctors appointments (including scheduling his), meal prepping, having him lunch packed and ready for him to take to work, setting up his coffee every night to brew right before he'd be up to go to work. I never asked him to do household things because I knew his job was draining and all he wanted was to relax when he got home. So I'd just be sitting there in my own sorrow while he got on his game and drank himself stupid every night. He'd get so drunk that he'd pee in random places around the apartment, and I'd have to clean it up, he'd pass out on the porch spilling beer and cigarette butts everywhere that I'd also have to clean. He'd leave countless cans all over the place, clothes everywhere, go for drives while drunk, just all around not being responsible. No matter how I'd bring up my concerns, he would roll his eyes and ""promise"" to do better but never did. It got to the point where every time I talked about something that made him uncomfortable, he'd literally pull out his phone and doom scroll while I was crying to him... And then he quit his job to get his CDL, and his drinking and gaming got so much worse. I slowly stopped cleaning up after him, and making his coffee for him since he'd sleep until 2pm, and I even stopped bringing things up because I knew they'd get nowhere. So, intentionally or not, I started distancing myself a bit... For more context, my family is trash and I've never been that close to any of them besides my brother, but my brother and I had a minor falling out and we didn't talk for almost 2 years. I have no friends since becoming a mother because all my friends were focused on partying more than anything, and the one person I had to talk to was drunk and didn't want to hear me... So I started playing video games again(something I had given up due to my depression, as well as art and music which had been my whole life before I met him), while gaming, I rekindled an old friendship with my friend(who is also a mom) and her brother. So I started to actually enjoy my nights again, I was actually laughing for once. It went like this for months. He'd wake up, get a cup of coffee, then immediately get on the game, and then start drinking shortly after. I'd get on my game and have a good time(taking care of the apartment, our son, and our dog the entire time) and things were calm and I began to accept that it would be like that for the rest of our relationship... Then I went to actually hang out with my friend in person. I saw the way her and her husband treated each other with so much love and respect without a second thought. I tried so hard not to compare our relationship to theirs, but it's hard not to when I see someone receiving unconditional love without begging for it behind tears, and I wanted that, Not her, not her husband, I just wanted that kind of love(they have been together for 15+ years)... It made me realize that maybe I haven't been asking for too much. I haven't been asking for him to do more household stuff(though it's welcome) all I've been asking for is his touch in a non sexual way. But every time he hugged me, he would start groping me, anytime he came to bed and tried to cuddle me, within seconds he'd be sticking his *bits* between my cheeks in hopes that I'd feel it flexing and welcome it with open arms... No matter how I talked about the fact that my entire body has become sensitive since having our son, he would take that as ""oh, I can turn her on easier now"", but that's not what I meant at all... Back to the point. For months we lived together but spent our time in separate rooms and he never cared to notice how upset I was... The out of the blue, he decided to get sober(which is great and I'm all for it, he's been promising he'd get sober for years), and he finally noticed how distant I had really become and it scared him, but now I don't know how to accept his advances... Ive literally begged to him for years, poured my heart and soul into him in hopes of a shred of attention, and now, when I've finally accepted the lack of emotion affection does he try to do something about it. Then, come to find out that his friend(we've never gotten along because he's been disrespectful towards women) was the one who pointed out the fact that he doesn't hear me over the mic that much anymore, then he decided to do something about it... His misogynistic best friend was the one he listened to, not me. Not the one person who's been crying to him about everything for years, the person who is supposed to be his partner in life... I'm just so broken and hurt by everything so we've broken up. He says he will keep trying to win my love back, but that he wants me to stay living with him and be his ""in name alone"" so he knows I won't go anywhere while he fixes this... And I just don't want to give my heart to him again right now, and I'm not sure when/if I ever will. He says this is all my choice, but he's making it hard to actually have a choice and I feel like at this point he's just trying to manipulate me to stay and it's making me more angry about the situation... What should I do? Any advice is welcome. If anyone has any questions, I'd be happy to answer as best as I can, because I know I've left a lot out to try not to make this longer than it already is...

News to me, honestly. Because according to literally everyone — coworkers, random classmates, my aunt’s neighbor’s dog — if a guy and a girl hang out more than twice a week, it’s basically marriage prep.

We grab coffee? “Aww, date morning!”
We sit next to each other at lunch? “You two look so cute together 😍”
He laughs at one of my jokes? “Wow, the chemistry is unreal.”

No, Brenda, the only chemistry we have is caffeine and sarcasm.

It’s gotten to the point where I feel like we need to wear shirts that say “NOT DATING, JUST COMPETITIVELY SUPPORTIVE.”

And the funniest part? The more we deny it, the less people believe us. Like, sorry we don’t flirt, argue, or make heart eyes — we just roast each other like siblings and share memes at 2 a.m.

Apparently, that’s love now.

Anyway, shoutout to everyone who can’t have a platonic friendship without society turning it into a rom-com. Hollywood really did a number on y’all.

For context, I started job searching around 5 months ago while I was still working in a highly stressful, toxic environment then was laid off a month ago, funnily enough it was only after the laid off that I started getting responses. All up I submitted 30 applications, 3 interviews and 1 offer. I also landed a short contract role while waiting which has a potential to turn into full time next year. Here are what I did and what I found worked (I’m also a graphic designer so some of what I said will be specific to that industry):

1) Using a simple layout for resume.

Single column, done in Word, no fancy graphics or layouts, I still made it nicely laid out with some colours but it’s all done in Word. The reason is ATS have trouble parsing images and two columns. I’ve had been rejected within 3 hours of submitting an application multiple times. I designed my resume in adobe indesign in 2 columns which worked 10 years ago but not now.

2) have a summary under my name, list key achievements before my work experiences. Focus on quantifying what you did rather than simple responsibilities. Use clear and simple bullet points. 

I including a short summary about who I am and my achievements : senior graphic designer with 8+ years experience (I have 12 years experience but apparently any number above 10 risk looking ‘too experienced’) building brands etc. 

then key achievements of what I have accomplished, for example any awards, big name brands I’ve worked for, if I have streamline processes and improved sales etc. I used to think I didn’t have any achievements but I realised I did more that I thought just need to think and reframe them 

Under work experiences I listed what I did and quantify when possible. For example : led the design of 100+ assets monthly. Collaborated with 4 teams across 3 countries. Increased productivity from 70% to almost 100%. Rough estimate of numbers is good enough, for example, as a designer it’s hard to find hard numbers so I went into my company’s instagram and compared the engagement rate of a post before I started and after and use the percentage of that. The point is to show companies the impact you have made rather than just want you did.

Also make sure your bullet points are simple and clear to read. Recruiters need to be able to skim

Make your resume 2 pages max

3) Made a good generic resume and cover letter then tailor to jobs I really want and spray and pray for the rest 

I spent 2-3 hours making sure my resume and cover letter fits for the jobs I really wanted (maybe around 10 or so) and then just send the generic ones to the rest.

4) used ai tools sparingly

I mainly used resumeworded and ChatGPT. Resumeworded compared the quality to other resumes at your level and make suggestions where you can improve. It also checks for spelling and grammatical errors and have a targeted resume check to see if it is targeted to the job description. I found it really useful but I didn’t use the rewrite function which could sound too ‘ai’ 

So I would take the suggestions and rewrite the bullet points myself and the use chat to improve the flow.

Speaking of ChatGPT I mainly used to polish my bullet points and summary AFTER I’ve written them myself and I always tell it to write in my voice and not to use m dashes. Then I go back and forth refining them with Chat until I’m happy with them. this prevents my bullet points from sounding too ‘ai’

5) LinkedIn strategy

I signed up to premium while job hunting primarily so I can use inmail. Whenever I see a mutual connection for a company I applied for, I would reach out to them to get a reference. 

If not I would try to find out who the hiring manager is on linked in and reach out to them directly, either in linked in or email usually with the excuse that I’d like to send them a pdf of relevant work I’ve done. 

I haven’t really had much success doing this ironically. Out of 10 or so jobs 2 managers have responded positively but I have not gotten an interview and the rest just ghosted me. But hey, you’ve got nothing to lose? Unless they specifically asked not to be contacted.

I applied to applications within the week they are posted.

6) Reached out to personal network and contacts

After I was laid off I sent a bunch of texts to ex managers and colleagues and had a bunch of coffees. I’ve always kept a warm relationship with them so it wasn’t like it was out of the blue it’s more like catching up. One of them actually got me a contract role pretty much right away which helped with finances, and another one got me a freelance project.

7) interview strategy

In addition to practicing the usual interview questions, id always research the company in depth and prepare some well thought out questions to ask. After every interview I always send a thank you email. So far every offer has come from hiring managers who have replied to my email. 

That’s all I can think of for now. The role that I landed is a 12 months maternity leave cover, I wish it’s more permanent but it is in a sector that i have been trying to break into for ages and hopefully they decide to keep me if I do well. I don’t know how much of the above have already been said and discussed on reddit but I just wanted to share just in case it helps anyone. It’s tough out there!

A couple of months ago, I moved to the United States, where the products, ingredients, and preparation methods are completely different, which also affects digestion. However, my tolerance to caffeine has sharply worsened in the last week. When I drink any kind, I experience abdominal discomfort, sometimes on the left, sometimes on the right, sometimes in the back. I read that it could be irritation of the intestines wall. This is quite possible, as the pain isn't localized, but rather spreads throughout my abdomen. I've started going to the bathroom more frequently, up to twice a day. I drink acidic beverages, including strong tea, and I experience discomfort, a slight burning sensation, and coffee causes significant discomfort. I don't drink, and I function normally. My question is: what could be the cause? How serious is the problem? What preventative measures would you recommend, such as vitamins, supplements, or antibiotics? Medicine is expensive here, so I don't want to just go to the doctor and say, ""Give up for three days and monitor your condition."" Thank you all in advance!

1ofc0pf,https://www.reddit.com/r/OdysseyBookClub/comments/1ofc0pf/how_to_start_a_conversation_without_sounding/,How to start a conversation without sounding weird: psychology-based tips that actually work,"We’re living in a time where DMing a stranger on Instagram can feel easier than saying “hey” to someone standing right next to us. Walk into any coffee shop, gym, or class and you’ll probably see heads down, headphones in, and people glued to their screens. It’s like real-world conversations have become this massive social boss battle that most of us would rather avoid. And yeah, social anxiety, fear of rejection, or just straight-up not knowing what to say are real blocks. But here’s the thing: most of us *want* to connect. We just don’t know how to start.

This post is a deep dive into what actually works, based on research, psychology, books, and expert-backed insights. Because honestly, I’ve seen too many TikToks and Reddit threads suggesting stuff like “just be confident” or “ask about the weather” like that’s supposed to unlock a whole friendship. Most of that advice is surface-level, recycled junk that doesn’t help people build real social momentum. So this post is about cutting the BS. And actually helping you get good, *like naturally good*, at starting conversations with anyone.

One of the biggest mindset shifts comes from Dr. Aziz Gazipura, a clinical psychologist who specializes in social anxiety. In his book *Not Nice*, he breaks down how most people ruin social interactions before they even happen, by overthinking, people-pleasing, or assuming they’re bothering someone. The truth? Most people are just waiting for *someone else* to go first. So when you start a conversation, you’re not being “annoying,” you’re being a relief.

The other thing to realize is most of your ideas about “awkwardness” are coming from you, not them. Dr. Laurie Santos from *The Happiness Lab* podcast (Yale professor, cognitive scientist) talks a lot about the “liking gap”, this idea that people like us more than we think after first interactions. Meaning: you think you’re weird or boring, but they’re probably walking away thinking you’re cool. Science backs this up. A 2018 study published in *Psychological Science* showed that people consistently underestimate how much others like them after initial conversations.

So how do you get past the “what do I even say” part? Start by removing the pressure to be impressive. The best openers are ones that show attention. Not perfection. If you’re at a bookstore, “Have you read this one yet?” works better than a rehearsed joke. At the gym, “Is someone using this?” can lead to an actual convo. Context gives you a shortcut.

Vanessa Van Edwards, behavioral investigator and author of *Captivate*, recommends using what she calls “observation openings.” Basically, point out something around both of you. It could be the music, the vibe, or something funny that just happened. This makes you seem socially aware, not random.

Also, stop trying to be smooth. Be curious. The most magnetic people are the ones who *listen* like it matters. A great way to start is just, “That’s interesting, how did you get into that?” Curiosity creates connection. And when you’re genuinely interested, the convo flows.

Another game-changer: reduce friction. Don’t wait until there’s a “perfect” moment. You can build a habit of approaching by starting with low-stakes interactions. Talk to baristas. Ask someone how their day is going. These tiny reps build your social muscle. It’s exposure therapy, but in real life. And it works.

Make conversation feel like a game. This is where **BeFreed** comes in. It’s an AI-powered learning app that helps you learn real human psychology in small, digestible chunks. What makes it stand out is how it turns expert interviews, books, and real-world strategies into personalized podcasts you can actually use. You can choose your vibe, want a 10-minute sassy voice giving you tips on being more confident in convos? Done. Want a 40-minute deep dive in a calm tone on social psychology? Also done. It even builds an adaptive learning roadmap from what you listen to. Basically, it learns how *you* learn. And yes, it’s packed with tools on conversation skills, body language, and social confidence. Plus, it gives you resources from all the books I’ve mentioned here.

For something more reflective, **Finch** is a cute app that uses a virtual bird to help you set social goals and track daily interactions. It’s low pressure and adds an emotional layer that makes habit-building feel more like self-care than productivity.

If you want a book that will rewire your brain around how people work, read **“The Like Switch”** by Jack Schafer. He’s a former FBI agent who specialized in behavior analysis. This book will make you rethink everything you assumed about likability and connection. It’s full of real-world stories from interrogations to coffee shop chats, and breaks down how to use body language, tone, and micro-behaviors to instantly build trust. Insanely good read. It’s not fluffy. It’s tactical.

Also wild underrated: **“You're Not Listening”** by Kate Murphy. This one blew up for good reason. It’s basically a masterclass in how to deeply listen in a world that’s obsessed with talking. And when you get better at listening, you naturally become better at starting conversations, because you recognize cues you’d normally miss. This book made me hyper aware of how distracted I used to be. Now I actually hear people.

Want something more visual? Check out **Charisma on Command** on YouTube. Their breakdowns of how people like Obama, Zendaya, or Ryan Reynolds navigate conversations are gold. You’ll see exactly what makes people magnetic, and how it’s less about being loud or charming and more about being *present*.

Then there’s **The Social Skills Lab** podcast. It’s hosted by Daniel Wendler, who’s an author and psychologist with Asperger’s. So he actually had to learn social interaction step-by-step. Which means his insights are insanely practical. No fluff. No vibes-based advice. Just real frameworks.

Bottom line: you’re not bad at talking to people. You probably just never learned how. And that’s not your fault. But you can learn this. Like any other skill. And when you do, your world gets *so much bigger*. Because conversations aren’t just about talking. They’re about access, to friendships, opportunities, confidence, and life.",2,1761346711.0,OdysseyBookClub,0,1.0,False

***Tooth Fairy***  

Edgar shambled across the street, his left ankle twisted the wrong way around. It made walking more of a limp-drag affair, but he was in no hurry. Nowhere to be these days. It was nice, relaxing. Shamble out of the rain when it starts, shamble into the sun to dry off, find a nice place to freeze over winter.

Some zombies avoided that part, hunkering down indoors. Edgar thought that was silly. Being alone with his thoughts for a couple of months was a truly enlightening experience. He could replay *years* of his life in his mind without silly things like ‘work’ and ‘smartphones’ and ‘food’.

He regretted wasting so much time in the office, for the months on the run from the horde.

The only thing he missed was coffee. Without the finger dexterity to grind beans - or the power grid to heat water - it was years before he found his way to a functional coffee shop that would serve him.

The Fun Tea Friday Cafe was an interesting place. It was always just around the corner, but only on Friday. 

Edgar politely plucked his nose off at the door and stuck a piece of silly putty into the hole before entering. No scent of flesh meant no sudden, ravenous hunger. A small price to pay to have access to coffee and pleasant company.

Inside, the warm earthen tones, wooden tables, and comfortable atmosphere appeared in stark contrast to the crumbling, run-down ruins of civilization outside. He found it more than a little amusing that he wasn’t the only “monster” here, either. Vlad, Remus, and Bill - a vampire, werewolf, and ghost respectively - would have made excellent companions for Edgar to go out on a Halloween spree… if his world hadn’t all gone zombified, at least.

A wizard - Merrin, Edgar believed the name to be - was talking to a small winged creature with long, spiky hair and insectile wings. A *fairy*. If Edgar still had a working heart or nervous system, he would have been trembling and sweating. Fortunately, the little creature didn’t seem to pay him any mind, so he shambled up to the counter.

Dee was behind the register; her hair once again a different color, as it was nearly every time Edgar came. This was definitely one of the more conservative looks he could recall; short brown hair with a thin red streak.

She greeted Edgar as he approached, saying, “Hello, welcome to Fun Tea Fri- *Jesus!*” She jumped back, nearly into a large glass jar containing dark coffee beans.

Edgar chuckled; a wet, choking sound that flapped his half-exposed larynx.

“Oh, Dee, you alwaysh know how to maych a guy laugch,” Edgar said, many words coming out wrong. He rarely spoke outside of the cafe, and not all of the bits-and-bobs of his mouth were still in the right place, or in him at all.

“Uhh…” Dee’s eyes darted to the side, where Patty - the skeleton manager of the cafe - was working the espresso machine for someone’s order. Dee looked back at him. “Sorry, uh, sir, but I haven’t met you yet.”

“Huh?” Edgar wanted to raise an eyebrow inquisitively, but had none.

“Yeah, sorry, uh, f-first time for me. I think this place travels through time or something.”

“You know, I would haff oncsh shaid that was ridihchuloush,” Edgar said. “But ever shinch my skull wash bit opehn by my bish of an ex-wife, my mind ish more open ash welwl. Jush know that you are an amazhing pershon and we awll appreshiate you.”

Pity they wouldn’t be able to continue their chat about Ronald McDonald this week, he’d have to bring it up next time.

“My ushual ish a sponge soaked in black coffee. Light roasht, pleash.” He leaned forward. ""I like to shoak it on my tongue.""

“Uh-huh…” Dee was quite pale as she wrote it down on a piece of paper. “Any, uh… sugar? Or…”

Edgar held up a hand and shook his head, making his loose eye bounce about. “No thanksh.”

He felt something roll in his mouth and looked down, trying to catch it. A tooth fell out, bounced off of some exposed bone, and clattered onto the counter.

""MINE!"" a high pitched shriek startled him. The fairy flew up to his shoulder, grabbing on and looking down, snarling. She dove at the tooth on the counter as Edgar screamed and hobbled away as fast as he could go. He *hated* fairies.",1,1761346586.0,ZLErikson,0,1.0,False
