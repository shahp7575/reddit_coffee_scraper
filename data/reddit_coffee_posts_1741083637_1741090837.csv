My (29F) husband's (30M) new friend (34F) is making me jealous,"tl;dr Husband meets woman in hobby class, they quickly become friends, she's inviting him out to a show and my alarm bells are ringing. Am I just over reacting?



My husband met a woman in his pottery class. He likes working with his hands, and he's pretty introverted, so I persuaded him over a few months to try the local pottery studio and meet people. But now I'm beginning to regret it.

As he says it, they hit it off very well. She's in the same industry as him (accounting) and into the same science fiction books as he is. They ended up getting coffee after the last workshop and traded a bunch of book recommendations.

Today he said that she's invited him to see a stand up comedy show. My husband always wanted to take lessons in stand up comedy but been putting it off, and apparently she's done amateur stand up for 2 years so she knows the local scene. I told him that I feel uncomfortable about it and he got visibly sad and confused. He says it's just a friendship because of many shared interests and nothing more and that this woman is just super extroverted and friends with a ton of people at the pottery studio. 

Am I right to be jealous? I trust my husband. He's been a solid, loving, caring man. I've definitely had some bad experiences with men in the past, so maybe I'm overreacting.  Can someone pls give me a reality check?",1,1741090790.0,relationships,0,1.0,False

1j39euw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dryeyes/comments/1j39euw/cutting_dairy_may_have_improved_my_symptoms/,Cutting Dairy May Have Improved My Symptoms,"I got diagnosed with dyspepsia a month ago and the doctor told me to cut off from acidic foods, spicy ones, coffee, and dairy. Two days in my new diet and I began to notice that my eyes have been feeling alright, almost normal. Surprisingly, I can look at screens for a really long time, there are no headaches, no doziness, no dry or gritty feeling, everything was like... normal, except when I'd wake up in the morning with really dry eyes, but even that has improved! My eyes during the mornings are less dry than when I had not yet avoided dairy. So to test if my idea is correct, I took dairy a few times this week and my eyes would feel dry many minutes to hours later. 

This may not work for everyone, but I hope this could reach some help to those who are still looking for ways to improve their symptoms.",1,1741090444.0,Dryeyes,0,1.0,False

He only mentioned to me before going that it is his friend.

Before the play he mentioned ""let me text my friend and know when I can meet her""

I thought it was just a regular friend and usually he only went to theater with two of his guy friends. We only been with each other for 7 months so I thought maybe still a regular female friend. 

But it was strange to me that he didn't mention her name or any background context. I have some feeling that it was not a regular female friend.

Next morning when we drink coffee and there's a hair he picked up himself and said that was my hair, because he was with a blonde girl last night.

Then he said it was a girl named Vivy and they used to go on 10 dates but wasn't a match so they decided to stay friends since then.

When I was told so I feel a bit uncomfortable because the context seemed wrong: going on one-one theater date with an ex date while he is in a relationship with me on a Saturday night.

But he said he had no feelings for her and they are just friends.

I acted calm and just said it is a bit strange to process for me.

He said I was more conservative and he is more liberal on this matter of staying friend with exes.

And he said he would be fine if I do the same, it is just a matter of trust.

I feel so confused guys.

1j39bi2,https://i.redd.it/kfywnpxsynme1.jpeg,My Third Arrest - Felony Fraud,"‚ÄúBailee Johnson?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes sir, is there something I can do for you officer?‚Äù I respond from behind my desk. 

‚ÄúWe need to talk to you for a moment‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs very important.‚Äù

Little did I know that at the end of this conversation, my life would change forever. 

3 hours earlier, I arrived at my office early as I always did. I checked in through security, walked across the large tiled entry, and up to the elevators. I rode to the 12th floor, stopped by the coffee machine and then headed to my office to get my day started. As the youngest female to ever be in management in the finance team at this firm, expectations were never higher. Getting into the office early helped me prepare for my day and gave me a quiet start to an otherwise demanding job. 

I entered my office and sat down, my short skirt sat nicely on my thighs and my fitted blazer added the executive presence I was hoping to demonstrate to our senior leaders. Combine that with a tall pair of stiletto heels and I exuded the perfect mix of professional and sexy. I always sought to find the balance between fashion and class, and today I felt especially good. 

My day started normally, a couple of meetings and reviewing reports from my small team. I reminded myself of my date later tonight - my friend had just set me up with a cute guy she went to college with and this was date #3. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll try to leave the office on time tonight to make sure I‚Äôm not late like I was for the first two dates.‚Äù I think to myself as I look at my calendar for the afternoon. 

As I sat focused on my work, I heard a small disruption out in the office. I didn‚Äôt think much of it, probably just a visitor. A few moments later, though, three uniformed police officers arrived at my office door and stepped inside. 

They asked my name, which I quickly confirmed. A helpful smile crossed my face as I asked what I could do for them. I figured they needed some information about one of our clients - an uncommon but not unheard of situation. The smile quickly fell from my face as I heard the words. ‚ÄúMiss Johnson, you‚Äôre under arrest for felony fraud. Please stand up and turn around.‚Äù

My heart sank. ‚ÄúFelony fraud?‚Äù I thought to myself. Within moments, I quickly realized that my efforts to avoid taxes had led to this moment. I figured maybe someday, at worst, I‚Äôd be fired or disciplined by the company for not reporting the tax error on my weekly paychecks. But arrested? It never even crossed my mind that it could be illegal. 

Having been arrested twice before, I knew the drill and knew there was nothing I could say right now to avoid what was coming. ‚ÄúUhh, ok, yes sir.‚Äù I responded quietly, hoping not to draw too much attention to myself. I stood up obediently and put my hands behind my back. 

The officer approached me, handcuffs already dangling from his hand, and tightened them into my wrists. He led me to the wall where a female officer quickly gave me a pat down. He grabbed my arm and began walking me out of my office. The weight of the handcuffs felt heavier than ever as I was led away. I struggled to get my wrists into a comfortable position, and tried to display as much confidence as possible to those who were watching. 

As I walked, things felt as though they were in slow motion. Coworkers watched in stunned disbelief as their manager was walked out of the office in handcuffs. I kept my head high, but tried to avoid eye contact. Several colleagues whispered and I felt the sense of being watched by everyone who was nearby. I was led to the elevators and eventually down to the lobby. My heels clicked loudly on the tile floor as we took the long walk to the police cruisers awaiting outside with flashing lights. The officer firmly gripped my upper arm as he led me to his car. A small crowd gathered outside to see what commotion had drawn a police presence, and they were among the first of many to witness me in handcuffs over the course of the few months. 

An extensive trial took place, but despite doing my best to fight the charges I was eventually convicted of a felony. I stood before the judge, handcuffed and shackled, and received a sentence of 12 months in prison, in addition to restitution requirements and other fines. I would go on to serve 9 months of that sentence in prison with the remaining months served on house arrest due to COVID overcrowding. To this day, I have never returned to that office, and the last memory those coworkers have of my time there is me being escorted away in handcuffs. ",1,1741090111.0,womenarrested,0,1.0,False

The place was closed so was gonna go tomorrow 

Walking down the road I saw the dog in a bar, I woke the owner to ask  ‚Äúis this your dog‚Äù to which he said yes as it nibbled again on my calf (this time I was prepaired with socks and pants on)  

I then asked ‚Äúhas it had the rabies jab‚Äù 

To which he put his thumb up at me and went bavk to sleep. 

His answer seemed half arsed and like he didn‚Äôt care ‚Ä¶ which scares me , but the pup was biting everything to which I‚Äôd assume he‚Äôd have given it the shot (?) right? 

Now obviously I can easily play it safe and get the vaccine , but my mum had it and had a real bad reaction to it which scares me getting it if it‚Äôs unnecessary. 

 Is there a way I can check if it has ? 
Is it likely he was being honest or just getting me to fuckoff ? 

Is my desire to bite a worry ? (Joking lol) 

But serious what would you do ? And what do you think of his answer ?

And now that i quit drugs I have periods where i consume about a 1 gram of caffeine daily or more. It's everything. Coffee and caffeine pills. Caffeine pills i only take 4 a week, because I don't want to fuck up my tolerance more. The main issue is energydrinks. I often drink 1,5 liter an a row and sometimes drink 5 a day

Balance for me with caffeine seems impossible, have tried many times. I love it too much. And it doesn't help my insomnia, ovethinking and anxiety (obviously)

1j39aim,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialMediaMarketing/comments/1j39aim/how_we_organically_scaled_an_ecommerce_skincare/,How we organically scaled an ecommerce skincare brand from $2000 to $48000/month within 8 months,"
Hello Redditors, just wanted to share a recent success story of a skincare brand that we worked with. 
When the owner first approached us for marketing, she was losing money on paid ads despite having high-quality products developed by a talented dermatologist. Business‚Äôs online presence was a mess, and the website wasn‚Äôt communicating brand‚Äôs offerings in a convincing manner. I understand that the humble beginnings of this venture might be relatable for a lot of you and I hope you guys will be able to find immense value through this post. 

After our initial market research we found that there is genuine demand in the market for their products but the trust factor is missing. When we found that the owner herself is a dermatologist, we proposed that we can rally the brand behind her professional authority instead of draining money on paid ads.     

Here‚Äôs how we did it: 

What really changed things for them was our approach of making social media and SEO work together instead of treating them as separate channels. In this strategy, social content feeds SEO performance, and SEO research informs social content creation. Since sometime, we have been noticing that google is paying way more attention to social signals, viral TikToks and Reels are showing up in search results. This means that if you are creating good content on social media, you‚Äôll not only make sales through views on that particular platform(which dies down after a few days) , but your content will get indexed on google as well creating a never ending stream of sales. This works really well for service businesses too - we've seen accountants, lawyers, and consultants use the same principles to grow their client base in addition to ads. We still chose traditional SEO with social media for this brand because there was decent search volume for relevant keywords. 

First things first - we had to fix their website. It was a technical nightmare. Won't bore you guys with the specifics but here are some key technical changes that we made - We had to rebuild the whole thing from design perspective, got the page load speed down from 4.2 seconds to 1.8 seconds, fixed their site architecture (they had product pages competing with category pages), implemented proper canonicals to fix duplicate content issues, and added relevant schema markup for their products and reviews. Small thing, but we also compressed all their product images - they were loading 4MB images on mobile which was killing their Core Web Vitals scores. Don't sleep on technical SEO - it's boring but it is extremely important. Even if you are planning to do seo yourself, make sure to generate a technical seo report from several free tools available online and fix the issues before moving ahead. 

For our keyword research, we didn't just use the usual tools. We dug into Reddit, Quora, and skincare forums to find the actual language people use when talking about skin problems. Direct keywords like, ""anti-aging cream"" get a ton of searches, but the competition is insane. Instead, we found long-tail opportunities around specific ingredients and skin concerns. Like, ""fungal acne safe moisturizer"" has decent search volume but way lower competition, and the conversion intent is super high. This works in literally any industry - find the specific language your customers use and optimize for those phrases instead of the obvious head terms everyone else is fighting over.
We then turned SEO insights into social-first content. So when we saw people searching for ""niacinamide benefits for skin,"" we didn't just write a blog post. We had the founder make a quick and engaging reel explaining the science in a way that didn't feel like a lecture. People were searching for this info anyway - we just gave it to them in a format they'd actually enjoy consuming.

A practical example of our approach: We identified ""bakuchiol vs retinol"" as a high-potential keyword. We created:
A detailed, scientifically-backed blog post comparing the ingredients
A series of short-form comparison reels with product applications
An infographic breaking down the benefits of each that went viral on Pinterest
A downloadable skincare guide for sensitive skin featuring both ingredients that worked a lead magnet

The result - The blog post ranked in the top 3 for the target keyword, while the social signals from the viral content further boosted their search rankings. Meanwhile, their social reach expanded because the content was backed by solid SEO research showing what people actually wanted to know.

For social, we used some of our go-to strategies that always seem to work but still aren‚Äôt widely used especially by new creators. For instance, we had the founder film her videos during ""golden hour"" because we noticed that soft, natural lighting boosted watch times by 22%. We also tested different hooks and found that starting with something like, ‚ÄúHere's something your dermatologist probably isn't telling you about..."" doubled engagement compared to other intros. 

We also experimented with what we call ""content sandwiching"" - we'd post a teaser on TikTok that ends with ""full routine on Instagram,"" then post a slightly longer version on Instagram that says ""full guide on our website."" This created this perfect funnel that moved people across platforms and eventually to their store. The engagement metrics were great, with about 18% of TikTok viewers actually making it all the way to the website. I've seen this work for all kinds of businesses - from real estate agents to coffee shops to software companies. I won't suggest doing this a lot though as it might create frustration among followers. We usually use this strategy when we already have a decent following on all the platforms so that the final traffic which reaches the website is actually worth it. Also, if you have been posting valuable content consistently, your followers are curious to find additional platforms for connecting with you and  don‚Äôt mind following a few extra steps for supporting your business.

Another strategy that worked really well was intentionally leaving out small details in reels that people would ask about in comments, then the founder would reply with separate reels as responses. Instagram's algorithm LOVES this kind of engagement, and it also gave us ideas for future content based on what people were asking.

We also tried something a little different with their content calendar which has wired well for us in the past as well. Instead of sticking to the usual approach of posting at ‚Äúoptimal times,‚Äù we grouped content around specific skin concerns and released it all at once. For example, we‚Äôd create five videos about acne and post them within 2-3 days. This made the algorithm take notice and treat the brand as an authority on that topic. Almost immediately, we‚Äôd see a big jump in followers who were  interested in acne solutions.


This is a sustainable way of growing followers since the content clusters belong to similar categories, the audience attracted by the first topic stays interested as we explore more topics. After a few days, we switch to another topic, like dry skin or anti-aging but we keep adding interesting content related to previous content clusters from time to time. For instance, after the initial acne videos, we‚Äôd follow up with more related content, like ‚Äúbest products for acne-prone skin‚Äù or ‚Äúhow to prevent breakouts.‚Äù This kept the momentum going and maintained interest over time. 

For the first couple months, we focused mostly on creating amazing content and building free backlinks. As the revenue and profits started increasing, we ramped up our link building to include some paid backlinks as well. Basically don't get too caught up in advanced link building when you're starting out (if you don‚Äôt have the budget) - for most niches, the basics still work great if your content is actually good.

Our content strategy had four main pillars: Educational stuff (science behind ingredients, common skin care myths), Before & After transformations, Behind-the-Scenes content (showing how products are made), and some promotional stuff (but super minimal). The educational content consistently crushed it compared to other categories. We've found this content mix works for almost any business - just adapt the pillars to your industry.

The most important question you should ask yourself before posting anything is super simple: ""If this showed up in my feed and it wasn't from my brand, will I actually watch it?"" If the answer isn't an immediate ""hell yes,"" scrap it and look for something else. This one question probably saved us from posting tons of mediocre content that would've just been ignored for previous clients as well.

After continuous efforts for 8 months, their organic traffic has now gone from practically nothing (1,200 visitors) to 37,000 monthly visitors. Their rankings have improved from ranking for just 12 keywords to over 780 in the top 10 positions. Their conversion rates have hit 3.8% from organic traffic (which is pretty good e-commerce), and their social following on Instagram went from 2,300 to 68,000, TikTok from zero to 42,000. 

When the owner first approached us, profitability wasn‚Äôt her immediate concern. With so much competition online, her primary goal was to scale revenues first. She planned to focus on profitability later by introducing upselling and bundle-selling strategies once the brand had gained traction. But because we focused on organic growth methods, the business became profitable right from the start. 

The brand is projected to hit $100K/month by third quarter and we're now working on phase 2 of our strategy - expanding into YouTube with more in-depth content, building an interactive skin type quiz for the website which will act as a lead magnet, targeting more keywords for SEO, launching email campaigns for retargeting and the owner has decided to reinvest a small part of profits into paid ads now so we are working on a ppc strategy as well. 

Marketing strategies should be designed with profitability as a core goal from the beginning. This can give businesses a significant advantage - It ensures sustainability and provides the financial flexibility to experiment and scale faster in the long run.

The trip is already going to be expensive, plane tickets, airbnb, eating out, and we did a majority vote for three different options. 

One of them was a latte art class, and I honestly feel like spending $70 for a class for this will be a huge waste of money. I haven‚Äôt told anyone yet that I may not attend if that is what we‚Äôre going to. I preferred the other two choices, and decorating coffee that will just be destroyed just feels like a waste. The other options were pottery painting and tufting, which are both things we can take home and cherish forever.  

This is no disrespect to latte artists, its amazing and creative. Personally that‚Äôs not something that I would spend that MUCH money on. We all love coffee, and coffee friend dates are kind of our thing as a friend group.

I (23F) have been in a relationship with my boyfriend for over two years, all in all there have been multiple things that have caused us to fight and almost break up. It all started two and a half years ago when I was still in a relationship with my ex and my boyfriend who was in a relationship with his ex but we were both wanting to break up with said exes. During all my university and high school years I was always at home, never had I gone out and I was going through a lot of mental issues that made me very closed off UNTIL- I met him. I‚Äôll call him Mark, Mark and I knew each other from a common group of friends that I was introduced to by my ex five years ago but I never really had close contact with since they were only around during the summertime due to them living in a different city. Fast forward to a long fight with health issues and surgeries and drama and after a long battle with a toxic job environment had resulted in me using alcohol as a coping mechanism, Mark prohibited me from drinking even a drop of alcohol. Now, I‚Äôve started a new job and I‚Äôm in a more relaxed and friendly environment. However, Mark has been accusing me of being controlling and not letting him go out and have fun with his friends, which I never really did to him. However when I have asked him to go out for a coffee with one of my coworkers he has raised assumptions about this being my cover story for going out with another guy. Now, since the start of my moving in with Mark, I‚Äôve found various things like thongs, brushes, photo albums and letters from his exes lingering around the house. I‚Äôve pleaded Mark to gather them up in a box so I can store them somewhere in the attic since it‚Äôs clear that he doesn‚Äôt want to throw them out. Now, I‚Äôve been quite aware of this man‚Äôs exes from the still existing instagram posts with them, me being excluded from his account, but never actually come across them. A couple months ago, after my attempt, we met up with our friends at their house andddd guess who‚Äôs there too? His ex. The one that was in a relationship with before me. Now the story of their relationship is too long to explain now but lemme tell you, she didn‚Äôt want to leave him. *IMPORTANT NOTE*. Mark always had access to all my stuff and accounts but had always had his phone and each account locked from me and always is hiding his phone from me. Now back to the story, he obviously knew she was there but he never told me anything. I was dumbfounded and confused as I walked in and saw her, and during our stay here, her trying secondhandedly to get Mark to talk with him. Now after all this time, I‚Äôve asked him to be more open and transparent with me and to pack up his exes stuff since I am living in the same house as him and apparently, the memories of his exes but he brushes me off all the time.

Has anyone else just assumed the pain was part of life?,"Sorry if this is really long winded I‚Äôve not planned what I‚Äôm about to type and I‚Äôm awful for going on and on- ADHD I guess, always wanting to give the full picture! I‚Äôm hoping this post might give people a fellow account that they can maybe relate to or give them a space to share their experience, or even be helpful for someone undiagnosed who is googling for answers- I know I consulted this page a lot while I was fist researching what felt like a long list of unconnected symptoms! 

TL;DR  my ADHD medication has cured chronic pain that I‚Äôve been living with but hasn‚Äôt helped my concentration or focus so is being changed. Has anyone experienced similar and does anyone know if this is hopefully something all medications might treat? List of questions at the end of my post. 

For context, I‚Äôm 32, I was diagnosed last year after a 3 year wait under the NHS (ultimately used the right to choose scheme). I‚Äôd never considered having ADHD until 4 years ago; I was struggling mentally for a while but it had gotten really bad and a guy friend of mine who has ADHD invited me for coffee one day to talk to me about it and lend me his book Fast Minds as he thought I might benefit from it. Couldn‚Äôt be more grateful to him. 

I ticked off nearly every symptom that the book and every other source I then started to research talked about experiences and couldn‚Äôt believe how far back the obvious signs went. Reading my school report cards was an experience filled with mixed  emotions - my teachers were consistently praising my academic ability but at the end of every report without fail would be a few small comments about some of the following: time keeping, organisation, chatty ness, daydreaming, talking over people and not waiting my turn etc. They were always ignored as problems because I was getting straight A‚Äôs and I had friends and was likeable. One in particular stood out to me which was a report on public speaking, it listed almost all of those negative things, but then concluded that ‚Äú[she] shows great skill at appearing to talk entirely off the cuff and without any preparation, although it is clear given her control of the audience that this cannot be the case. I suspect if [she] asked us all to march into battle tomorrow, we would follow her‚Äù. But amongst my friends I would refer to that ‚Äòskill‚Äô as my bullshit guns, and I‚Äôd always joke that they were always ‚Äòlocked and loaded‚Äô ready to say whatever people needed to hear. 

Ok sorry, that is a tangent- my point is- I tick off all of these symptoms- but I was never aware that ‚Äòchronic pain‚Äô was a symptom of ADHD. And I still struggle to find much that says it definitely is. 

For years I have awoken every morning and my body has been in pain- I have always described it as ‚Äòaching‚Äô. I couldn‚Äôt tell you the last time I didn‚Äôt waken like this as it‚Äôs been so long. It felt as though overnight my body would seize up and every day I would be trying to power through to loosen up. I‚Äôll be honest, I‚Äôd always assumed it was something everyone experiences and assumed it was just a facet to getting older that nobody mentions because it would be attention-seeking or trying to come across as ‚Äúwoe is me, my problems are worse than yours‚Äù and ultimately who am I to think my life is harder than anyone else‚Äôs. I didn‚Äôt think it was ‚Äòchronic pain‚Äô as that seemed too far fetched. I attributed this alone to why I could barely face getting out of bed each morning. 

In combination, I attributed the following things:

1- I was very overweight (BMI of 34) 

2- my diet was very poor, I couldn‚Äôt face cooking and ordered take away all the time, which I would overeat even when I wasn‚Äôt hungry. 

3- my posture was bad

4- I have a very stressful and technical job at the best of times, but add to that I couldn‚Äôt seem to motivate myself to do my work until the last minute and the constant stress of that felt like my brain was always screaming at me. 

Over the last couple of years I have addressed points 1-3. Which has really been a challenge and not a consistent road, but my BMI is now 26 and I‚Äôm working on the consistency. Edit note: these improvements didn‚Äôt take the pain away at all. 

To the actual point of the post‚Ä¶I‚Äôm so sorry it‚Äôs taken until this point‚Ä¶maybe you‚Äôre still reading‚Ä¶.or maybe this is just catharsis for me by now and I‚Äôm here alone! 

I started my medication titration 4 weeks ago. I have initially been prescribed Methylphenidate, specifically Meflynate XL. I started on 20mg for a week, then 40mg for a week and have now been taking 60mg for two weeks. 

My prescriber has suggested changing my medication to Elvanse as I have not noticed any changes in focus or concentration, and when I started out these are the big ticket items that I thought medication usually offered and so they were what I said I‚Äôd like to prioritise. 

On the first morning of meflynate XL I woke an hour early, took the medication along with a handful of muesli (so many people warned me to eat something while I took them) and then I went back to sleep for an hour. When I woke an hour later, I honestly have been struggling to describe the silence I experienced. It was almost loud how quiet everything seemed. It felt as though an industrial air conditioning unit had been running in my head and I‚Äôd become so used to it that I hadn‚Äôt realised how loud it was‚Ä¶and suddenly it had been turned off. Honestly I spent the first couple of days in such awe of it, it felt so peaceful. It actually made me feel really sleepy because I think I was almost tricking myself into thinking the tranquility meant I was so relaxed I was tired. The other thing I noticed was the immediate lack of any pain in my body. It was all gone. 

I‚Äôm now 4 weeks in. I don‚Äôt notice how crazy the silence is any more- I got used to it really quickly that I struggle to remember what it was like before. It‚Äôs odd because it sometimes tricks me into thinking my head was always this quiet, or that it‚Äôs not working anymore. But it definitely is. It now becomes obvious when I realise I‚Äôm not shouting at myself in my head all the time about a million things. It‚Äôs like those things are now written on post it‚Äôs in my head- they‚Äôre still all scattered about and not prioritised but they‚Äôre written for me to read when I choose to rather than constantly being screamed at me. 

The thing that has remained the most consistent and delightful is the lack of pain. I honestly feel like I‚Äôve been given my teenage/20 year old body back. I‚Äôm not scared to move it or get up and I feel like it could be functional. To be clear- I‚Äôm not suddenly motivated to be the best or most active person ever- I‚Äôm just really enjoying moving without hurting. I‚Äôm realising just how draining and depressing and horrible that pain has made my basic daily life. And I find I‚Äôm sleeping much better because I actually feel like my body is relaxing and comfortable when I lay in bed, as though rest is actually restorative. 

That all being said- I‚Äôm not finding myself to have any more focus, or concentration or ability to start or complete tasks that I‚Äôve been putting off. And those are quite important for me. So I‚Äôm going to try Elvanse. Ive had two days off of medication completely while I‚Äôm waiting on my new prescription and for those two days I have immediately felt the return of the aching and pain. And this has really opened my eyes to what I was living with. 

I guess my questions to everyone are:

1- have you experienced chronic pain and did you feel it was linked to your ADHD? 

2- have you noticed this go away with medication? 

3- does anyone know if this is treated by elvanse? As I now find myself in a dilemma- I‚Äôd elvanse improves my concentration etc, but not the pain. I genuinely don‚Äôt know which solution I would prefer.

This witch got in a relationship with a married woman, was 50% responsible for destroying a family and she thinks she can complain about me? Bruh like what?? Lmao That's like a criminal complaining about going to jail for a crime they actually committed. That woman has absolutely no brain cells at all. She has no personality whatsoever other than watching all those trash reality TV shows like the Kardashians, too hot to handle, love is blind, and 90 day fiance type stuff and I can't stand those joints. That stuff is wack asf lmao. There was also this one show she would binge that had guys dress up as women and that mess was cringe as hell. How the hell does she like that kind of trash? She also likes palm readings and all that kind of trash which is so weird. The one thing tho that she liked that I found the most annoying of all was her obsession with zodiac signs. I can't STAND zodiac signs. That stuff is so fake and she actually believes that lmfao. Can't make this stuff up she really has just bad tastes in anything. See I'm a nerd and I'm not afraid to admit it because nerdy stuff is actually awesome and has substance unlike the stuff that woman is into and I box so there's that. Boxing (Which is my favorite thing ever, my passion), anime (AoT, Bleach, Naruto, Dragon Ball, Tokyo Ghoul, Vinland Saga, Cyberpunk Edgerunners etc), Marvel (My favorite superhero is Spider-Man), DC (My favorite DC hero is Batman), Star Wars (Anakin Skywalker my goat), Avatar The Last Airbender, The Legend of Korra, The Lord of the Rings, Dune, Percy Jackson, Blade Runner, The Karate Kid, Cobra Kai, Rocky, TMNT, Supernatural, a lot of animated movies from pixar, dreamworks, and Disney overall and video games like Marvel's Spider-Man, Batman Arkham, Assassin's Creed, God of War, GTA, RDR, Mass Effect, Dragon Age, Uncharted, Middle Earth, Final Fantasy etc and I like to go urban exploring even tho that's kinda dangerous and plus I wanna travel the world. These are all the stuff I love and stuff that I want to do and that woman used to complain a lot about what I was into and I'm like bro, you're the most boring person in the world. Nothing about you is even remotely interesting. On top of that, that woman would find the absolute most silly thing to complain about. If one plate wasn't clean, she would complain, if a sock was on the floor, she'd start complaining. She once got mad when she spilled a cup of coffee one morning and when I noticed it, I smiled and what did she do? Yeah, she complained. Lmao Just don't have skill issue when it comes to picking up stuff and maybe then I won't laugh at you being silly. Straight up karen bro Istg. She's ignorant as hell too. Thought I was talking crap about her to my grandma awhile ago when I was speaking spanish to her. Like lady are you dumb? My grandma doesn't speak English so of course I'm gonna speak in my native language. I don't even like talking about her when I'm with my buddies and family members.

**Summary**:

After Saiki accompanied Toritsuka to the forest because of strange rumors, with an offering of coffee jellies, it turns out that they found the source of the rumors. The Yokais!

It turns out that they do exist, and that the reason Toritsuka didn't see them is because of Saiki, but now there is a tiny problem. The energy clash between Saiki and the Yokai caused Saiki to transform into a Yokai!

And it seems that he now has, almost, all the Yokai powers!

# Trivia

* Saiki can switch between human mode and yokai mode.
* The reason why Toritsuka never saw any Yokai is because of Saiki's aura, which is composed of 2 (known) parts. The inner part covers a radius of 200m and holds the highest concentration of energy, the outer part extends up to 90km and has less concentration of energy but keeps the Yokai away.

You know when you get multiple signs from the universe and you think maybe it's trying to tell you something? 
Well, this is how this new book that I am starting to write, started. Every day on my daily phone calls to my girlfriends, I would tell them about yet another disastrous date I had gone on. 

After a while, they all said ""Damn girl you should write a book about all of your dating horror stories"" and the rest was history. 
Dating today is horrible and if you're a woman who is over a certain age, it is even worse out here.   I was married for 24 years and in an abusive marriage. Back in the Stone Ages they didn't have online dating, you met the old-fashioned way through a friend, at a club, or organically at the supermarket. But with everyone's busy life things have changed and like it or not, welcome to the age of technology and online dating.

So I did it, and in the last 11 years of being single, I have had so many horrible dates that I lost count. I knew that I needed to step back. I was exhausted from dressing up to meet someone and it being yet another bust. I needed time to work on myself. To make sure that I was healthy enough to not make past mistakes with men. 

The first thing I did was stop dating for a year. Instead, I started writing more, and working out with my girls.  I started praying more and going back to church. I involved myself in things that I loved, the beach, my friends, and shooting pool. I learned to fill my life without a man. To heal myself so that in case the right one came along I was healed and ready.

Being back on the dating sites, unfortunately, has not changed. The men still ghost you, they text and never want to meet, and yes, they still send dick pics. This time around after my break I have done things differently.      I talk on the phone a few times and that always gives you a feel for who they are. Texting to me is just a form of miscommunication, you can't get a vibe from texting especially if you don't even know if it's them or AI. I then decided just to meet for coffee dates, casual and fast. I can be out of there in 20 minutes or less and don't have to waste over an hour getting ready and a few hours sitting through a horrific date. I've learned these things from taking time away and realizing what I will and will not put up with. 

So today my friends, remember sometimes the problem is you. Sometimes you need to step back and look deep inside yourself, to find yourself again. To learn what it is that made you run after love instead of loving yourself first. To learn that you're okay on your own and to give you the patience and the knowledge to put up boundaries. It is only then you can begin to be the change you want to see.

I just checked out of the Montcalm East in Shoreditch and it was a pretty amazing stay. About me: female solo traveler, gold member, first trip to London, stayed 4 nights. I prioritize walkable locations, safety, and budget. I usually look for what I consider mid-priced hotels. In this case I wanted to use 2 free nights. I had seen a few mentions here on the sub and they helped me make my decision. 

The hotel itself is very sleek and modern. The room has smart controls for everything. The heated bathroom floors were a nice touch! I booked a feeling superior room but was upgraded to a junior suite. I loved it! Comfortable bed, water spouts conveniently located in the halls, plush robes, nice shower with clearly marked toiletries and no flooding. Location was 5 minutes from the Northern Line. I was able to get everywhere i wanted to go in under 30 mins. Lots of restaurants and coffee shops close by. There's an Aldi right near the underground if you need any basics. The staff treated me well at all times! 
Be aware the hair dryer is in the closet and not the bathroom! I actually had to ask about this!

1j38xlf,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/1j38xlf/a_2d_puzzlepoint_and_clickdecisionbased_game/,A 2D puzzle/point and click/decision-based game about ordering a pizza,"**Title:**  
One Pepperoni Pizza, Please

**Gameplay Summary:**

Throughout several ""levels"", players are presented with a short scene (like a visual novel) and can click around/interact with the scene to unlock options and progress the story. Players must balance their available money while they have to keep ordering and eating pizza to refill a sort of ""health"" meter. They lose the game if they run out of money or health, although depleting the meter does not immediately cause death/a negative effect on the game besides your character's expression looking angry and a gross stomach gurgly noise. It's mainly there to put a sort of urgency to progress the game by ordering more pizza. The MC earns a salary each month which he uses to buy pizza (this job etc is never explicitly shown, we only see the MC in his evenings). The MC is given an option of restocking his fridge with healthy items (ordering groceries) or using his stove to cook meals, but food that isn't pizza becomes less effective at filling the meter over time, until only pizza satisfies him (he gains weight/looks unhealthier as time goes by if he only eats pizza). I'm envisioning a mostly linear, short game, with a few alternate endings to encourage a few replays. Ultimately it would be humourous/dark comedy/short story that becomes more absurd the longer you play. You ""win"" the game when you get one of the various endings (I have some ideas on these, e.g. the pizza company employs you in a kind of pizza MLM scheme/ the pizza company assassinates you/ the pizza company pays you in pizzas to keep you quiet about what happened...)

**Mechanics:**

Point-and-click interaction with three static home scenes as the backdrop. You start in the living room as the default location (maybe your character is sitting on the couch watching tv, with the player's perspective slightly above the top of the tv, looking down on the character while the light from the tv flickers across his vacant expression. You can interact with certain objects to progress the story or change some visual aspect of the scenes, e.g. in the living room you can click on the tv remote to change the channel, or click on the phone to order a pizza or check your email, click on the coffee table to clean up or view pamphlets. You can change the scene to another room by clicking on the front door or the kitchen door. At the front door, you can open the door to accept a pizza delivery or look outside (but the character never goes outside) or check the mail for new pamphlets. The kitchen: You can click on the fridge to check for leftovers or clean up, or click on the stove/oven to try cooking a meal.

**Story:**

\[Intro cutscene\] Main character (MC) is an average dude in his early twenties at home entertaining a few friends. After some minor character dialogue, MC's buddy suggests ordering a pizza from the new restaurant that opened nearby. He presents a pamphlet about them: 25% off our famous Pepperoni Pizza if you sign up as our newest Pizza Patron! MC calls the number and hears that the place only delivers, and only pepperoni pizzas. He gives his address, email, and phone number and consents to becoming a ""pizza patron"". 

Gamplay starts a week later, MC is alone at home (player can explore interactable items to figure out how to progress) feels hungry. None of the food at home satisfies him. When checking the mail, he finds a new pamphlet with a new deal - buy 1 pizza get one free, only on Tuesdays. All other days, the price is tripled. Ordering the pizza is clearly the most economical and effective way to proceed. Each subsequent week that passes, things get weirder as previous deals expire and the pizza company introduces new deals and new ""tiers"" of patronage that unlock even more deals, all of which result in MC basically becoming dependent on pizza and consenting to increased levels of enmeshment with this pizza company. He never knows when the price of pizza will skyrocket, so he feels he needs to stock up on pizza when there are good deals (can use common marketing tactics as inspiration and exaggerate them for comedic effect). Though pizza expires and must be thrown away so there is always some tension about food security. The delivery people start making unsettling comments as if they know him personally when they drop off pizzas (is he under surveillance?) and if he orders pizza from another company they ""punish"" him by removing his precious Pizza Patron Points (and the other pizza place goes out of business/is absorbed by the pizza company). Eventually his house is filled with pizza company merch, he can only survive on pizza, his tv is only showing pizza-related content, and he reaches one of the story ""endings"" as a result of his choices.",1,1741088664.0,gameideas,0,1.0,False

How does caffeine feel to you?


I'm thinking about eliminating it forever although I like coffee, there are studies that indicate that it affects Gaba receptors

I understand that the increase in the density of the GABA receptor is because it loses sensitivity.

In my case, before the PFS it felt great but now it doesn't make me feel good.

In the midst of depersonalization and derealization (DPDR), the world can feel like it's wrapped in a layer of fog‚Äîfamiliar places seem strange, your own reflection might appear foreign, and there's that persistent, unsettling feeling of being somehow disconnected from reality. What makes this experience particularly challenging is the natural human instinct to fight against it, to try desperately to ""feel normal again.""

I know this struggle firsthand. When I was suffering from DPDR, I felt like I was trapped in a dream-like state. I was completely disconnected from my body, and the world around me seemed unreal. The anxiety was relentless, 24/7. I had severe panic attacks multiple times a day, and over time, I became agoraphobic. The existential thoughts consumed my life, each arriving with a jolt of fearful sensations. I would get so dizzy that my friends had to help me back to my dorm. I spent day and night researching every symptom, desperately trying to figure out what was happening to me.

And all of it happened suddenly. I used to be the guy who cheered up the group, loved debating, and gave public lectures. I had leadership skills, confidence, and a vision for my future. But DPDR burned all my dreams and destroyed my self-esteem.

# Facing Reality Without Fighting It

Then, one day, I saw a thumbnail of Dr. Claire Weekes. I clicked on her video, where she explained nervous illness in a way I had never heard before. At first, I didn‚Äôt believe her. How could doing nothing be the answer? But slowly, as I gained psychoeducation on what was happening to me, I began to see the truth in her words.

Dr. Weekes' revolutionary approach to anxiety disorders, including DPDR, centers around a seemingly counterintuitive principle: doing nothing. She emphasized that the first step toward healing is recognizing that what you're experiencing is simply anxiety‚Äînot madness, not permanent disconnection from reality, just your nervous system in an overly sensitized state.

When I realized this, it changed everything. I had spent so much time resisting, analyzing, and trying to fix my DPDR. But I finally understood that by accepting it, I would be sending my amygdala signals that everything was okay. Instead, I had been running away and reinforcing my fear. I was using coping methods, seeking reassurances‚Äîcompulsions that only strengthened my sensitization. No amount of reassurance could ever satisfy a sensitized nervous system. I finally understood that my urge to figure out my thoughts was itself a trap. My symptoms weren‚Äôt the problem‚Äîthe sensitization was.

# The Paradox of Acceptance

Perhaps the most profound insight in Weekes' approach is that acceptance‚Äînot resistance‚Äîpaves the way to recovery. This isn‚Äôt resignation or giving up; it‚Äôs a dynamic form of allowing.

I learned that my DPDR was like waves on an ocean. Fighting against these waves only exhausted me, while acceptance allowed me to float through them. I started saying to myself, *""I feel unreal today, and that‚Äôs okay.""* Instead of desperately seeking the feeling of reality, I made space for the unreality. Instead of pushing away the numbness, I allowed it to be there.

This shift in mindset created real neurological change. Each time I encountered DPDR without fear, my brain received the message that these sensations weren‚Äôt dangerous. My nervous system‚Äôs fire alarm gradually stopped ringing because I had shown it there was no emergency.

I remember reading the story of a woman who recovered using this approach. She said, *""For months, I‚Äôd wake up every morning and immediately check if I still felt detached. One day, I decided to just say ‚ÄòYes, I feel strange, and I‚Äôm going to have my coffee anyway.‚Äô That small shift‚Äîaccepting rather than fighting‚Äîwas the beginning of my healing.""* I resonated with that so deeply.

# The Gentle Art of Floating

Anxiety creates an urgent sense that we must do something to escape our discomfort. We research endlessly, seek reassurance, or try various techniques to ""snap out of"" DPDR. This urgency, however, keeps our nervous system activated.

Weekes' concept of ""floating"" offers an alternative. Instead of struggling against the current, you allow yourself to be carried by it. You stop swimming upstream.

In practice, this meant I had to continue living my life alongside the DPDR. I had to go to dinner with friends even when everything felt dreamlike. I had to complete my work despite feeling detached from my hands as they typed. I had two choices‚Äîeither wait until I felt normal again to live my life, or live my life and trust that normal feelings would return in their own time. I chose the second option, and that‚Äôs what finally allowed me to heal.

# The Healing Power of Time

Recovery from DPDR isn‚Äôt instantaneous. The nervous system needs time to reset after prolonged states of heightened alert. Weekes emphasized patience‚Äînot as passive waiting, but as active trust in the body's natural healing processes.

I remember constantly checking for improvement, like watching grass grow. The more I stared, the less I noticed any change. But when I finally redirected my attention to living my life, healing happened naturally.

# The Courage to Do Nothing

Perhaps the most challenging aspect of Weekes' approach is embracing its central paradox: the way out is not through doing more, but through doing less. Not through fighting harder, but through surrendering the fight altogether.

This doesn‚Äôt mean becoming passive in all areas of life. It means being active in living while passive toward the symptoms themselves. It means going for that walk, having that conversation, working on that project‚Äîall while allowing the strange sensations of DPDR to be present without resistance.

A recovered individual put it beautifully: *""I had to learn that recovery wasn‚Äôt about finding the perfect technique or understanding exactly why this was happening to me. It was about having the courage to do nothing about the DPDR itself, while doing everything to live a meaningful life despite it.""*

# A Return to Natural Being

At its heart, Weekes' approach is about returning to a state of natural being‚Äîone where we're not constantly monitoring our internal experience or fighting against it. It‚Äôs about relearning to live from the outside in, rather than from the inside out.

The four steps‚Äîface it, accept it, float through it, and let time pass‚Äîcreate a framework for this return. Each step builds upon the others, gradually retraining the brain to stop perceiving these unusual sensations as threatening.

I won‚Äôt lie‚Äîhealing wasn‚Äôt linear. There were setbacks and difficult days. But each time I chose acceptance over resistance, floating over fighting, I strengthened new neural pathways that led me back to feeling connected with myself and the world around me.

And one day, I looked in the mirror and thought, *""Yeah, that‚Äôs me again. But better. Stronger. More resilient.""* I wish I could articulate everything here, but time and space won‚Äôt let me do that.

Peace!

At its peak in 1823, London was producing over 1.8 million barrels a year. Here is everything you need to know about this stylish historical beer style.

Not only did this beer whet the whistle of the thousands of street porters in London, but it was also shipped out in huge quantities across the Empire (including to India in far greater quantities than the more famous¬†[**IPA**](https://letempsdunebiere.ca/ipa-india-pale-ale-and-the-evolution-of-a-beer-style/)) and the wider world, where it was incredibly popular.

# London Porter Throughout History

By the end of the[¬†**First World War**](https://letempsdunebiere.ca/what-did-soliders-drink-during-world-war-2/), however, like the Empire, Porter was in decline. For decades, its popularity had waned as quality deteriorated, and grain shortages during the war led to a reduction in alcohol content. Across the world, other breweries had begun making similar brews (see: Guinness), and new, exciting styles like Mild (yes, it was exciting once!) emerged, ultimately shifting the center of British brewing from London to Burton-on-Trent.

It is in this historical context that we find this beer from¬†**Brasserie Albion**, a brewery that specialises in English style beers, in Saint-Joliette, Quebec. 

P19 is a historic London Porter brewed to a recipe from 1919. For authenticity, it uses heritage malts and whole cone hops to stay true to tradition. The result is a significantly roasty beer with notes of dark chocolate and a slightly smoky¬†[**tobacco**¬†](https://letempsdunebiere.ca/how-south-american-foods-changed-history/)flavor long associated with this style. There‚Äôs some black licorice in there too, alongside a subtle caramel note that adds a touch of sweetness.

Overall, the beer skews more bitter than most other Porters I‚Äôve tried, but it is perfectly balanced and makes for an easy, sippable beer with tons of complex flavors to enjoy.

# What does a London Porter Taste Like?

A typical London Porter will have a rich, well-balanced malt character, featuring deep flavors of roasted grains, dark chocolate, and coffee, often accompanied by subtle caramel and toffee sweetness. Compared to other porters, it tends to have a slightly lighter body and a more refined balance between bitterness and sweetness.

Traditional London Porters use heritage malts like brown malt, which impart a dry, toasty quality rather than the heavier, almost syrupy sweetness found in some American or Baltic porters. The hop presence is usually mild to moderate, adding an earthy or slightly floral bitterness that complements the malt without overpowering it. Additionally, [London Porters](https://letempsdunebiere.ca/london-porter-a-beer-review/) often showcase a faint smoky or ashy edge, a remnant of the older malting techniques used historically, giving them a drier, more complex finish than sweeter, modern porters.

What makes this kit special? Is it worth your hard-earned money? Let's find out in this hands-on review.

# Introduction to Asgard Memory

Before jumping in, it's good to know that Asgard is a China-based manufacturer of memory and storage solutions. While they might not have the same recognition as some industry giants, they've been making waves with their Norse mythology-themed products. The BRAGI series is named after the Norse god of music and poetry, which explains the piano key-inspired design that we'll discuss later.

# Specifications and Technical Details

Let's get the numbers out of the way first:

* **Capacity**: 32GB (2 x 16GB modules)
* **Speed**: 6800MHz
* **Timings**: CL 34-42-42-90
* **Voltage**: 1.40V
* **Part Number**: VAM5UX68C34AG-CBRAMIN

* **Memory Type**: Hynix A-Dies
* **PMIC Controller**: Richtek (RTQ5132GQWF)
* **Memory Design**: 1Rx8, 2G x 64-bit

This 6800MHz kit sits at an interesting spot in the market, filling the gap between the more common 6400MHz and 7200MHz offerings. The CAS latency of 34 is pretty impressive for this speed tier, promising good performance in both gaming and productivity tasks.

# Unboxing and First Impressions

# Packaging

The Asgard team clearly put thought into creating a premium unboxing experience. The kit comes in a black cardboard box wrapped with a paperboard cover that showcases the BRAGI concept and piano key design. Upon opening the box, you're greeted with a paper sheet showing pencil drawings of the key components.

# Included Accessories

What stands out about this kit is the attention to detail in the included accessories:

* **Microfiber cloth** for cleaning the glossy surface
* **White gloves** to prevent fingerprints during installation
* **Bottle opener** (a unique addition)
* **Serial number stickers** (optional to apply)

The inclusion of gloves and a microfiber cloth isn't just for show - they're practically necessary due to the highly reflective mirror finish of the modules, which can easily collect fingerprints.

# Design and Build Quality

# The Piano Theme

The standout feature of the BRAGI series is its **piano key design**. The modules feature one black and one white diffuser, mimicking piano keys. This design becomes even more apparent when all four DIMM slots are populated, creating a keyboard-like appearance.

# Heat Spreader

The heat spreader is described as a ""dark coffee mirror vest"" made from **2mm thick aluminum** using a cold forging process. The CNC machining is precise, giving the modules a premium feel. The glossy, reflective surface is truly eye-catching, though it requires careful handling to maintain its pristine look.

# Module Height

At approximately **45mm tall**, these are high-profile modules. This is an important consideration if you're using an air CPU cooler that extends over the DIMM slots, as there might be clearance issues. However, this shouldn't be a problem with AIO liquid coolers.

# Memory Components

Looking inside the module reveals a **black PCB** with a single-rank design. The memory uses **Hynix A-Dies** with the part number H5CG48?EBDX018. Each module has 4 memory chips on each side of the PCB, with the PMIC chip positioned in the center. A thermal pad covers the memory chips to help with heat dissipation.

# RGB Lighting

The RGB implementation on the BRAGI kit is tastefully done. The diffuser provides even distribution of light across its surface, highlighting the piano key concept. The lighting is compatible with major RGB ecosystems:

* ASUS AURA SYNC
* GIGABYTE RGB Fusion 2.0
* MSI Mystic Light Sync
* ASRock Polychrome Sync

What's particularly nice about the diffuser design is that there's no Asgard branding on it, giving a clean, uninterrupted lighting effect. The top of the diffuser doesn't have a catcher, contributing to its sleek appearance.

# Installation and Compatibility

# BIOS Profiles

The Asgard BRAGI RGB DDR5 features both **Intel XMP 3.0** and **AMD EXPO** profiles, making it suitable for either platform. There are a total of four profiles in the BIOS:

1. XMP Profile 1: 6800MHz 34-45-45-108 at 1.40V
2. XMP Profile 2: 6400MHz 34-45-45-108 at 1.40V
3. AMD EXPO Profile 1: Same as XMP 1
4. AMD EXPO Profile 2: Same as XMP 2

It's worth noting that the same settings are used for both Intel and AMD platforms, which might raise concerns about the 1.40V on AMD systems given past issues with higher voltages. The kit also supports the JEDEC 4800MHz base speed at 1.1V.

# Platform Support

The memory was tested on a GIGABYTE Z790 AORUS ELITE AX motherboard with an Intel i7-13700K processor. Based on the profiles available, it should work well with both Intel 600/700 series and AMD platforms that support DDR5.

# Performance Benchmarks

Build quality is another standout feature, from the CNC-machined aluminum heat spreader to the thoughtful inclusion of accessories like gloves and a microfiber cloth for handling the glossy modules.

With cross-platform support via Intel XMP and AMD EXPO profiles, the kit offers versatility for those who might switch between Intel and AMD systems. The RGB lighting implementation is tasteful and compatible with major motherboard manufacturers' RGB ecosystems.

At a score of **9/10**, the Asgard BRAGI RGB DDR5 6800MHz CAS34 earns its ""Tech4Gamers Recommended Award"" designation. For gamers and enthusiasts looking for premium memory with distinctive aesthetics and room to grow through overclocking, this kit deserves serious consideration.

While not the most budget-friendly option, the combination of performance, design, build quality, and features makes it a compelling choice for those willing to invest in quality components for their gaming rig.

1j38bf9,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1j38bf9/my_parents_favouritism_i_need_advice/,My parents favouritism!!! I need advice,"Hello fellow potatoes,
Looking for some advice.

I (32f) have 4 siblings (34f, 25m, 15m, 13m). I love them dearly. However, I feel guilty, because I am getting jealous, not of my siblings, but of my parents relationship with some of them.
Let me give some context about my siblings:

K (34f) is engaged with 5 kids and another on the way.
J (25m) lives with his bio dad and has a girlfriend.
M (15m) lives with my parents, in high school and has a girlfriend.
L (13m) is also in high school, lives with  parents, and extremely smart.
As for myself, I am married, have a baby, and am currently studying, and on a break from work

My parents have always been supportive of my decisions, yet have called me out on my BS when deserved, like a good parent does. They have done this with all kids and treated us the same. Until recently...
I used to talk to my parents about everything, whether it be relationships, general advice, etc. I used to also see them quite often. But for the past year, they have started talking to me less and less. Whenever I do see them, they are constantly saying how my younger brother (M) has an amazing gf. Don't get me wrong, she is amazing. But the way they talk about her, they never talk about my husband that way. 

Ever since I met my husband, they haven't seemed to like him. This doesn't really surprise me, as they haven't liked any of my previous partners, havent liked any of my sisters (K) partners (she was married and had been engaged previously), and haven't liked my brothers (J) partners. They always say my husband is a 'nice enough guy', but they think he has changed me. I do agree, but he has changed me for the better. Since meeting him, he supported me and convinced me to go back to uni, helped me change my eating habits (I've never been big, but I've always wanted to lose weight), and helped me to take pride in my appearance, as I was always self conscious about how I look. 

When my son had his first birthday, last week, we didn't see anyone else ON his actual birthday, we tried to arrange a catch up with family for a different day, both on my side and my husbands side. But my parents were ""too busy"" to even do coffee. 

Anyway, I don't know how to talk to my parents about this. I don't know how to approach them with hiw I'm feeling regarding the jealousy, as well as why they don't want to see me as much any more. It really hurts that they don't want to see us as much, especially for my son too. 

I know I went way off topic, but any suggestions or thoughts about how to talk to them would be great. I've tried in the past, but they just say 'its fine, there's nothing wrong' 

Please ask questions if you want 

Further context:
My siblings and I have the same mum, but so w different dads
K and I have the same bio dad (out of the pic)
J has a different dad 
M and L have same dad (technically my step dad, but since meeting him, he has become my dad)

 ""Government Proposes Nationwide Ban on Civilian Weapon Ownership.""

The broadcast shifted to footage of protests erupting in various cities.

Yet, despite the unrest, the news anchor reported that Congress had already passed the legislation.

Lisa pushed her plate away. ‚ÄúThis might be the clones of the aliens trying to ensure we can‚Äôt fight back.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs possible.‚Äù 

Before they could dwell on the thought, Charles‚Äôs phone buzzed on the table.

He glanced at the screen before answering and putting it on loudspeaker.

‚ÄúHello.‚Äù

‚ÄúHi, Charles,‚Äù said Aunt Michelle.

‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôm with Lisa,‚Äù he replied, exchanging a look with her.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs even better,‚Äù Michelle said. ‚ÄúI just spoke to her, she accepted. She‚Äôll be ready in about two months.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs great,‚Äù Charles said, as Lisa grinned.

Michelle continued, ‚ÄúThat means you both need to start the body transformation process right away.‚Äù

‚ÄúUnderstood,‚Äù he said before ending the call and looking over at Lisa. ‚ÄúAre you ready for this?‚Äù

‚ÄúAbsolutely.‚Äù

For the next month, Lisa underwent an intense transformation.

She ate relentlessly, forcing herself to gain weight and change her body shape.

Her once smooth hands and feet became rough with calluses from hard labor.

She inflicted small burns on herself to rid her spotless skin.

She stopped using any skincare products and cut her long hair short.

She practiced walking differently, adjusting her posture and gait until even Charles noted that she no longer moved like herself.

She trained her voice, lowering it, adding an accent, tweaking her tone until it felt foreign even to her own ears.

She wore contact lenses to change the color of her eyes.

And she also practiced with Charles daily on identifying with her new history and personality.

By the time the month ended, Lisa was no longer Lisa. She had become someone else entirely.

One evening, as she and Charles sat in the living room, a knock echoed through the apartment.

Lisa smiled. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs finally here.‚Äù

She walked to the door and opened it.

‚ÄúWow,‚Äù Aunt Michelle said, stepping back to take in Lisa‚Äôs altered appearance. ‚ÄúYou look completely different.‚Äù

‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù said Lisa as she hugged her.

Michelle let out a small chuckle as she embraced her. ‚ÄúYou even sound different.‚Äù

After the hug, Lisa lead her inside.

Charles stood, offering Michelle a handshake.  She took it and they all sat down.

‚ÄúYou two have done an amazing job. But there‚Äôs still one more month to go. What‚Äôs the next step?‚Äù

Charles leaned forward. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll take Lisa to her old office and school. We need to see if the fake Lisa or her children will recognize her.‚Äù

‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt that risky?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs riskier is sending her back home and someone figuring it out. We need to be sure first.‚Äù

Lisa added, ‚ÄúThe encounters won‚Äôt be direct. I‚Äôll just be passing by, close enough to observe, but not close enough to raise suspicion.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat if they recognize you?‚Äù asked Aunt Michelle.

‚ÄúShe will have to go under the knife,‚Äù said Charles.

Aunt Michelle gasped.

‚ÄúPeople die for humanity, what is doing plastic surgery compared to that?‚Äù said Lisa.

‚ÄúYou have really changed,‚Äù said Aunt Michelle before changing the subject. ‚ÄúSo what was your time table during your transformation?‚Äù

Lisa chuckled before she began explaining, easing the tension in the room.

You know when you really want to love something, but it just doesn‚Äôt click? Like trying to get into deathmetal, black coffee, or cardio? That‚Äôs me with most of the 40k novels.

I started off strong with Ciaphas Cain and Brutal Kunnin‚Äô, two absolute bangers. Cain‚Äôs basically the Warhammer equivalent of a reluctant action movie star, and Brutal Kunnin‚Äô let me experience life through the eyes of an Ork, which is basically just unhinged joy and violence in written form 10/10, no notes.

But then I tried branching out. You know, expanding my horizons, seeing what else the grimdark universe had to offer. And uh‚Ä¶ well:

Dark Imperium ‚Äì Felt like I had been dropped into a lore exam I hadn‚Äôt studied for. Guilliman‚Äôs back, things are bad, and I think I was supposed to care more?

Dawn of Fire ‚Äì More like Dawn of Confusion. So much setup, so little engagement. It‚Äôs like ordering a burger and getting a lettuce wrap instead‚Äîtechnically the same thing, but your soul feels empty.

Infinite & the Divine ‚Äì Supposed to be the Necron equivalent of a buddy-cop movie, but I just couldn‚Äôt get into it. Maybe I missed the part where I was supposed to find ancient robotic squabbling funny?

Night Lords ‚Äì I should love this. Edgy chaos marines, right? But instead, it felt like reading the diary of a really dramatic goth kid who thinks his band is this close to making it big.

And then, just when I was about to accept that maybe I was doomed to only like a very specific corner of Warhammer fiction‚Ä¶ I picked up Fabius Bile: Primogenitor. And holy Emperor, I cannot put this book down.

Why? I have no idea. Maybe it‚Äôs the sheer audacity of Fabius running around the galaxy playing Space Mengele and somehow making it entertaining. Maybe it‚Äôs the fact that he‚Äôs technically the villain, but also kinda the protagonist, and somehow it works? Maybe I just like mad scientist vibes. Whatever it is, I‚Äôm hooked.

So now I‚Äôm left wondering‚Äîwas I just reading the wrong books? Or is Fabius Bile‚Äôs nonsense just that compelling? Either way, I‚Äôm along for the ride, and if he ends up cloning the Emperor or something, I won‚Äôt even be mad.

So any other novel suggestions would be great after inevitably finish all three novels.",0,1741086122.0,40kLore,7,0.4,False

You‚Äôre named after a tavern with a bear sign that George Washington allegedly visited, and that‚Äôs your peak? A colonial pit stop nobody‚Äôs confirmed? You‚Äôre clinging to a 250-year-old rumor like it‚Äôs a lifeline, but let‚Äôs face it‚ÄîWashington probably just pissed on a tree and kept moving. Your origin story‚Äôs so flimsy it wouldn‚Äôt hold up in a bar fight.

Your population‚Äôs what, 23,000? That‚Äôs less a community and more a crowd of people who got lost on their way to Wilmington and gave up. You‚Äôre 14 miles south of somewhere that matters, close enough to smell the city but too far to taste it.

Your big claim to fame is turning farmland into a suburban wasteland in the ‚Äò80s and ‚Äò90s‚Äîcongrats, you swapped cornfields for McMansions and Walmarts.

It‚Äôs the largest freshwater pond in Delaware, sure, but that‚Äôs like being the tallest dwarf in a circus‚Äînobody‚Äôs impressed.

Your economy‚Äôs a snooze‚Äîhealthcare, finance, retail? Sounds like a resume for a middle manager who peaked in high school. And those ‚Äúhigh-paid‚Äù jobs in utilities and transportation? Probably just truckers hauling chicken crap out of Sussex County, because that‚Äôs the real Delaware hustle. Your median home‚Äôs $173,000, which buys you a box with a view of a gas station and a neighbor who mows his lawn at 7 a.m. Sixty-eight percent own their homes? Great, they‚Äôre stuck there, too broke or too bored to escape.

Culturally, you‚Äôre a black hole. No downtown, no Main Street, no nightlife‚Äîjust a sports bar and a microbrewery where the most thrilling thing is a $6 IPA and a dartboard. Your dining scene‚Äôs a parade of mediocrity‚ÄîItalian, Chinese, American, all served up with the flair of a microwave dinner. Christiana Mall‚Äôs nearby, but that‚Äôs not yours, Bear‚Äîyou‚Äôre just the doormat people wipe their feet on before they shop somewhere better. And don‚Äôt pretend Glasgow Park or Becks Pond makes you outdoorsy‚Äîthose are just patches of grass where locals dump their empties.

Your history‚Äôs a yawn too. A tavern, some farms, then a housing boom‚Äîriveting stuff. The schools? A mishmash of Christina and Colonial districts with names like Oberle and Leasure, churning out kids who‚Äôll flee to Philly the second they can. Private schools like Caravel and Red Lion Christian? Even your rich kids are itching to bail. And black bears wandering in from Maryland? They‚Äôre the most interesting thing to happen to you since 1900, and even they don‚Äôt stick around‚Äîprobably because they‚Äôd rather wrestle traffic in Cecil County than deal with your suburban sprawl.

Bear, you‚Äôre the human equivalent of a lukewarm coffee‚Äînobody wants you, but you‚Äôre there anyway. You‚Äôre a speed trap with a zip code, a place so bland it makes oatmeal look spicy. Your biggest thrill is a DART bus ride to Wilmington, and that says it all‚Äîyou‚Äôre a layover, not a destination. If Delaware‚Äôs the appendix of America, you‚Äôre the scar tissue nobody notices.

The jump from DDR4 to DDR5 brought significant changes to the memory landscape, and manufacturers have been quick to capitalize on this new technology. Today, I'm looking at Corsair's Vengeance RGB DDR5-6000 C36 memory kit, one of their mainstream offerings that promises both performance and aesthetics for your next-gen PC build.

I've spent quite a bit of time testing this kit in various scenarios, and I'm ready to share whether this memory deserves a spot in your system. So grab a coffee, and let's jump into this detailed review of the Corsair Vengeance RGB DDR5-6000 C36.

# Design and Build Quality

# Aesthetics and Construction

The Vengeance RGB DDR5 memory didn't undergo radical design changes compared to its DDR4 predecessor. Corsair stuck with their winning recipe while introducing some refinements to the design. The modules feature a redesigned aluminum heat spreader with a familiar rectangular shape and triangle pattern that looks quite attractive in both black and white color options.

Standing at 44mm (1.73 inches) tall, the RGB version is about 25% taller than the non-RGB variant, which measures 35mm (1.38 inches). This additional height accommodates the RGB light bar on top, so keep this in mind if you're using a large air cooler that might interfere with taller RAM modules.

The build quality feels exceptional, with each module having a nice weight to it. The heat spreaders are firmly attached and show no signs of wiggling or poor assembly. The overall construction just **screams quality**, which is something I've come to expect from Corsair over the years.

# RGB Lighting Implementation

The lighting on these modules is implemented through a ten-zone RGB illumination system with ten individually addressable RGB LEDs. This gives you extensive control over lighting effects and creates a beautiful diffused light across the top of the modules.

Compared to Corsair's more premium Dominator Platinum DDR5, which features 12 Capellix LEDs, the Vengeance RGB doesn't fall far behind in terms of lighting quality. The diffuser running along the length of the module creates an attractive lighting effect with straight design and sloped sides that look impressive when illuminated.

A small Corsair logo is centered on the light bar, which is a smarter design choice compared to their DDR4 Vengeance Pro kits, resulting in a cleaner overall look.

# Technical Specifications

Before diving into performance, let's take a look at what's under the hood:

* **Capacity**: 32GB (2x16GB)
* **Frequency**: DDR5-6000
* **Timings**: 36-36-36-76
* **Voltage**: 1.35V
* **Memory ICs**: Samsung B-die
* **PMIC Controller**: ANPEC APW8502C-AY242
* **XMP Profile**: Intel XMP 3.0
* **Module Height**: 44mm
* **Warranty**: Limited Lifetime

Each module features a single-rank design with a capacity of 16GB. One exciting thing about these sticks is that Corsair has equipped them with Samsung's K4RAH086VB-BCQK (B-die) integrated circuits, which are known for their good performance and overclocking potential. While not quite at the level of SK Hynix M-die ICs in terms of overclocking headroom, they still provide solid performance.

# Installation and Compatibility

The Vengeance RGB DDR5 is designed as a plug-and-play solution for most users. When you first boot up your system with this kit, the memory will default to the basic DDR5-4800 speed with relaxed 40-40-40-76 timings. Enabling XMP in your BIOS will load the profile for DDR5-6000 with 36-36-36-76 timings at 1.35V.

Compatibility-wise, this kit works best with Intel's 12th and 13th generation processors on Z690 and Z790 motherboards. For AMD systems, while the kit isn't specifically optimized for AMD's EXPO technology, it should work with AMD Ryzen 7000 series processors and beyond, assuming the motherboard supports XMP 3.0 profiles.

Always check your motherboard's QVL (Qualified Vendor List) before purchasing to ensure compatibility with your specific system configuration.

One of the main selling points of Corsair products is their iCUE software ecosystem. This software allows you to control and synchronize lighting across all your Corsair devices, monitor temperatures, and more.

Setting up the Vengeance RGB DDR5 in iCUE is relatively straightforward. The software lets you configure your DIMM orientation to match your actual setup, and you get access to numerous pre-defined lighting effects with full customization options.

The RGB lighting controller in these modules allows for individual control of each of the ten RGB zones, giving you extensive customization options. You can create layers, each with distinct lighting effects, choosing from existing ones or creating your own unique patterns.

# Monitoring Capabilities

Beyond just RGB control, iCUE also provides monitoring capabilities for your memory. It displays VDD and VDDQ voltage readouts, power draw, and temperature sensors. You can even set up custom alerts based on temperature thresholds, triggering specific actions when certain conditions are met.

The temperature monitoring is particularly useful since DDR5 can run warmer than DDR4, especially when overclocked. Being able to monitor and set alerts for high temperatures adds an extra layer of protection for your investment.

# One Drawback

It's worth mentioning that some users have reported issues with iCUE not recognizing their Vengeance RGB modules on certain motherboards. This seems to be related to SPD Write settings in the BIOS. If you encounter this issue, you might need to enable this setting in your BIOS to get full RGB control through iCUE.

Also, at the time of this review, Corsair's iCUE software doesn't fully support AMD's EXPO profiles, although support is expected to be added in future updates.

# Performance Testing

To evaluate the performance of the Vengeance RGB DDR5-6000 C36, I ran a series of benchmarks using an Intel Core i9-12900K on an MSI MEG Z690 Unify-X motherboard. This setup allowed me to directly compare this kit to other DDR5 memory modules I've tested in the past.

# Synthetic Benchmarks

In AIDA64 memory benchmarks, the Vengeance RGB DDR5-6000 C36 delivered solid performance:

* **Read**: 94,276 MB/s
* **Write**: 83,428 MB/s
* **Copy**: 85,165 MB/s
* **Latency**: 66.9 ns

These numbers put it in a good position among other DDR5-6000 kits, though it's slightly slower than the G.Skill Trident Z5 RGB DDR5-6000 C36, which operates at the same timings but with a slightly lower DRAM voltage of 1.30V.

In real-world applications and productivity scenarios, the Vengeance RGB DDR5 performed reasonably well, ranking in fourth place overall among the DDR5 kits I've tested. It didn't stand out in any particular workload but showed consistent performance across the board.

# Gaming Performance

Interestingly, gaming is where this kit showed its strength. The Corsair Vengeance RGB DDR5 outperformed the competition in gaming benchmarks, though the margin between first and second place wasn't significant.

In 3DMark Time Spy, the kit secured a score of 19,262, which is respectable for a DDR5-6000 kit and places it firmly in the mid-to-high tier of gaming memory performance.

Remember that the impact of faster memory on gaming performance varies greatly depending on the game and your system configuration. CPU-bound games at lower resolutions tend to benefit more from faster memory, while GPU-bound scenarios (like 4K gaming) show much smaller differences.

# Overclocking Capabilities

Overclocking memory comes with potential risks, and the results can vary significantly from one kit to another even within the same model. That said, I was curious to see how far I could push this Vengeance RGB DDR5 kit.

With the Vengeance RGB DDR5 running at 1.35V out of the box, there was some voltage headroom for overclocking. Samsung told us the absolute maximum DC drain voltage for their ICs is 1.4V, so I stayed within that limit.

At 1.4V, I was able to achieve a stable DDR5-6600, representing a 6.7% overclock over the advertised speed. This required relaxing the timings to 38-38-38-78, which isn't terrible considering the frequency boost.

I also tried tightening the timings at the stock DDR5-6000 frequency. With 1.4V, I managed to run the memory stably at 34-34-34-74, which could provide a nice latency improvement for latency-sensitive applications.

What's interesting is that I had better luck overclocking this kit compared to the G.Skill Trident Z5 RGB DDR5-6000 C36, which uses similar Samsung B-die ICs. The G.Skill kit wouldn't run stably with the same 34-34-34-74 timings at 1.4V.

One thing to note is that the PMIC controller on this kit is locked, limiting the maximum voltage to 1.435V. This restricts the ultimate overclocking potential compared to kits with unlocked PMICs.

# Thermal Performance

DDR5 can run hotter than DDR4, especially when overclocked, so thermal performance is important. During testing, I monitored temperatures using the built-in temperature sensor.

At XMP settings with 1.35V, the modules reached about 45-48¬∞C under sustained load, which is perfectly acceptable. When overclocked to 6600 MT/s at 1.4V, temperatures increased to around 52-55¬∞C.

If you're planning to push these modules to their limits, I'd recommend ensuring good airflow over your memory, especially in cases with restricted airflow. While the heat spreaders do a decent job, additional airflow will help maintain stability during extended high-load sessions.

# Price and Value

At the time of writing, the 32GB (2x16GB) Corsair Vengeance RGB DDR5-6000 C36 kit is priced around $175-250 depending on sales and retailers. This puts it in the same price range as competitors like G.Skill Trident Z5 and TeamGroup T-Force Delta RGB with similar specifications.

For DDR5 memory in its current state, DDR5-6000 kits hit a sweet spot between performance and cost. They offer noticeably better performance than entry-level DDR5-4800 or DDR5-5200 kits while avoiding the premium price of higher-end DDR5-6600 options.

If RGB lighting isn't essential for your build, you can save about $20-30 by opting for the non-RGB Vengeance DDR5 variant with similar specifications.

# Pros and Cons

# Pros:

* **Good performance** right out of the box
* **Samsung B-die ICs** provide solid overclocking potential
* **Appealing design** with quality construction
* **Effective heat spreader** design
* **Ten-zone RGB lighting** with even diffusion
* **iCUE software** adds extensive customization options
* **Limited lifetime warranty** provides peace of mind
* **Temperature sensors** for monitoring
* **Stable XMP profile** that works without tweaking

# Cons:

* **Slightly slower** than similarly-specced competitors
* **Limited to 1.435V** due to locked PMIC
* **RGB control issues** on some motherboards
* **iCUE software** doesn't fully support AMD EXPO profiles
* White color option **hides the design pattern** somewhat
* **Price could be better** compared to some competitors

# Who Should Buy This Memory?

# Buy It If:

* You're building a white or black gaming PC and want matching RAM
* You love overclocking and want a kit with decent headroom
* You're a performance enthusiast looking for high-speed DDR5
* You already have other Corsair products and want to maintain ecosystem integration
* You appreciate the aesthetic of the RGB implementation

# Don't Buy It If:

* You're on a limited budget (standard DDR5-4800 is much cheaper)
* You have basic computing needs that won't benefit from high-speed RAM
* Your system doesn't support DDR5 memory
* RGB lighting control issues would be a dealbreaker for you

# Final Verdict

The Corsair Vengeance RGB DDR5-6000 C36 performs just as well as it looks‚Äîmaybe even a bit better. It offers a good balance of performance, aesthetics, and features that make it a solid choice for most users looking to upgrade to DDR5.

Performance-wise, it delivers what you'd expect from a kit of this caliber and timings. While it's slightly slower than some competitors with similar specifications, the differences are minor and unlikely to be noticeable in everyday use. It particularly shines in gaming scenarios, where it even managed to outperform some of its competitors.

The RGB implementation is attractive and well-executed, though the potential compatibility issues with iCUE are something to keep in mind. If RGB synchronization is critical to your build, you might want to ensure your motherboard is fully compatible before purchasing.

Overclocking enthusiasts will appreciate the Samsung B-die ICs, which provide decent headroom for pushing beyond the XMP specifications. While not class-leading in this regard, there's definitely some ""gas left in the tank"" if you want to squeeze out more performance.

Corsair's pricing for this kit is reasonable, positioning it competitively among similar offerings from other manufacturers. The limited lifetime warranty adds value and peace of mind for your investment.

Overall, the Corsair Vengeance RGB DDR5-6000 C36 earns a strong recommendation for those looking to embrace DDR5 technology with a well-balanced memory kit that combines performance, aesthetics, and reliability. It's not perfect, but its strengths far outweigh its weaknesses, making it a worthy addition to most gaming and high-performance PC builds.

If you're building a new system with Intel's 12th or 13th generation processors, or planning an AMD Ryzen 7000 series build, this memory kit deserves serious consideration. Just make sure your motherboard and cooler are compatible, and you'll be rewarded with solid performance and eye-catching RGB effects.

We broke up a few months after he was born but we remained friends and co-parented well. We even lived together until he was 2.5 years old but as co-parents instead of partners. We shared custody equally once we established our own separate homes but we remained close and communicated well. I even attended her wedding two years ago.

My son has a stepdad as well as two stepsiblings aged 10 and 8 who he lives with 50% of the time. But this is not working for our son. His stepsiblings do not like him and this has been a problem at my ex's house since the wedding.

It started with my son saying his stepsiblings didn't want him to play with them and he got left out. I asked my ex about it and she said there were some new growing pains that they were working on but it wasn't being ignored. Excluding him turned into mean comments. This turned into them yelling at him. Then it turned into them fighting with their dad and my ex over my son being included in anything.

My son was getting more distressed by it. He started asking to stay with me instead of going back to his mom's house. We talked about it and she told me she'd work harder on making her home feel more like home again for him. I told her we needed to get him therapy and she was reluctant because they had started to pay for family therapy and she didn't think they could stretch to both, so I took on the expense of our son's individual therapy.

My ex and her husband tried different things like separating his kids and trying my son with one of his stepsiblings but the results were the same, even with the one who's only a few months older. If they didn't have their sibling they just didn't engage or play. It tore at my son's self esteem even more, the fact they'd rather sit and be bored than play/interact with him. The bullying, because that's what it was, also remained when it was just one of them.

My ex and I had some disagreements about the therapy sessions. His individual therapist wanted to meet with the two of us but she said that was pointless and her focus needed to remain on family therapy. The individual therapy expressed concerns with the strain of the family sessions on my son but my ex didn't want to hear it.

My son's stepdad and stepsiblings started fighting in the house more and my son was hearing comments that really did a number on him emotionally. He doesn't understand why they hate him so much (his stepsiblings). He's miserable and he told me he doesn't want to go back. He told his mom too.

I had consulted with some family law attorneys on the issue and showed them what I had documented and the therapists recommendation but each time I was told the only guarantee to getting my son out of that environment is to get my ex to agree. That no judge would change the custody timeshare over bullying even with the therapist recommending it. I was told it would be different if this was physical violence but emotional abuse/bullying doesn't carry the same weight of consequence.

So I asked my ex if we could meet for coffee to discuss things and I asked her to please consider letting our son stay with me more. I told her we could figure out a schedule so she could still be very active in his life. But he won't be in her house with kids who bully him and have said to their own father they don't care about my son's feelings or if he's sad or ran away because he felt unwanted.

My ex told me it wasn't fair that she'd lose time with our son when she's not ignoring the issue. I told her I know it's not but it's not fair for our son to live like that either. She told me she couldn't lose him and how she'd miss him too much. I asked if she'd consider living separately from her husband and his kids for a while and she said no to that also. She said it was a crazy idea. I told her she needed to think of our son and what's best for him. She told me she's what's best for him and she sought her own legal advice and was reassured she wouldn't lose custody in the courts because of this. I asked her if she really felt that was better for our son. She told me I shouldn't be trying to take our son away from her. That it won't help anything. She said we were friends for so long and how could I do this. I told her my focus is on our son. She was angry that I felt like hers wasn't.

It's not that I think she doesn't care. But I think our son needs to be out of that situation. His individual therapist agrees but I have been told four times now that it won't be enough in a court. But my request has damaged the co-parenting relationship with my ex.

What if books had memories? Like, what if they actually remembered everything they went through?

Or worse, gathering dust on a shelf while shinier, newer books get all the attention. Would Harry Potter proudly write about the millions of kids whispering spells over its pages? Would a tattered copy of Pride and Prejudice fondly recall generations of hopeless romantics swooning over Mr. Darcy? And what about those poor, forgotten textbooks‚Äîwould they bitterly rant about being skimmed at 2 AM before an exam? Some books would have epic, adventure-filled lives‚Äîpassed between friends, filled with scribbled notes and coffee stains. Others? A tragic existence, untouched and longing to be read again.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you're looking to indulge your sweet tooth without dairy, you're in luck! Making your own dairy-free ice cream at home can be a game changer. Not only do you get to control the ingredients, but you can also craft flavors that surpass anything found in the freezer aisle. Here are some creative dairy-free ice cream bases that taste better than store-bought options.

### Coconut Cream Base

Coconut cream is a superstar when it comes to dairy-free ice cream. Its rich and creamy texture creates a luscious mouthfeel, making it an excellent base. To make, simply refrigerate a can of coconut milk overnight, scoop the solidified cream, and blend it with your favorite sweeteners and flavors. Whether it's vanilla bean, chocolate, or mango, coconut cream can elevate your ice cream to new heights!

### Cashew Milk Base

Cashew milk is another fantastic choice. Its natural creaminess comes from the nuts themselves, which can also be blended into a base. Soak raw cashews in water overnight, then blend them with water until smooth. This base works well with flavors like coffee, pistachio, or caramel. The nutty undertones add complexity to your ice cream that store-bought varieties often lack.

### Avocado Base

For a healthy twist, consider using avocado as a base. The creamy texture and subtle flavor make it an ideal candidate for ice creams. Simply blend ripe avocados with a sweetener of your choice and a splash of coconut or almond milk. Add cocoa powder for chocolate flavor or mix in lime juice for a refreshing treat. You might be surprised at how delicious avocado ice cream can be!

### Banana Base

Frozen bananas make for a sweet and creamy ice cream alternative. This base is super simple: just peel, slice, and freeze ripe bananas. Once frozen, blend them until smooth for a soft-serve consistency. You can easily add cocoa powder, peanut butter, or fresh fruit for variety. Banana-based ice cream is not only tasty but also packed with nutrition.

### Almond Milk and Silken Tofu Base

Using almond milk along with silken tofu can create a creamy and protein-rich ice cream. Blend silken tofu with almond milk and your favorite sweetener until smooth. This base is versatile; you can add matcha powder, vanilla extract, or fruit pur√©es. The addition of silken tofu enriches the texture without making it taste too nutty.

### Oat Milk Base

If you haven‚Äôt tried oat milk yet, it's time to give it a shot. Oats lend a creamy consistency that works wonderfully in ice cream. To make your base, blend rolled oats with water and strain. Mix the oat milk with flavors like cinnamon, nutmeg, or maple syrup for a cozy dessert. This choice is perfect for those looking for a wholesome option that's also gluten-free.

### Rice Milk and Coconut Sugar Base

A base made with rice milk is another excellent option for dairy-free ice cream. It‚Äôs on the thinner side but can be thickened with a bit of cornstarch or guar gum. Blending rice milk with coconut sugar gives it a caramelized flavor that is hard to resist. This base pairs well with flavors like chocolate or even spicy ginger for a unique treat.

Each of these bases can be customized to suit your palate. Think about what flavors excite you and don't shy away from experimenting. You can mix in chunks of your favorite dairy-free chocolate, swirls of fruit preserves, or even a sprinkle of sea salt to elevate your homemade ice cream.

However, achieving that rich and creamy flavor that rivals store-bought versions can be tricky. Here are some tips to elevate the flavors of your creations, making them not just a substitute, but a delightful dessert in their own right.

### Enhance with Sweetness

Sugar is essential in ice cream, as it helps achieve the right texture and sweetness level. However, consider using alternative sweeteners that can boost flavor:

- \*\*Maple Syrup\*\*: Adds rich, caramel-like notes.

- \*\*Vanilla Extract\*\*: A classic choice that enhances most flavors.
- \*\*Almond Extract\*\*: Perfect for nut-flavored ice creams.
- \*\*Peppermint Extract\*\*: Ideal for refreshing minty flavors.
- \*\*Coffee Extract\*\*: An excellent addition for coffee lovers.

### Incorporate Natural Flavors

Using fresh ingredients can significantly improve your dairy-free ice cream‚Äôs taste:

- \*\*Fruits\*\*: Fresh or frozen fruits like bananas, strawberries, or mangoes add sweetness and texture.
- \*\*Nut Butters\*\*: Almond or peanut butter can provide creamy richness.
- \*\*Cocoa Powder\*\*: Perfect for chocolate lovers; make sure it‚Äôs unsweetened for best results.
- \*\*Spices\*\*: Cinnamon, nutmeg, or ginger can elevate flavors and give warmth.

### Add Texture and Crunch

Don‚Äôt forget about texture! Consider adding some of these elements:

- \*\*Chopped Nuts\*\*: Pecans, walnuts, or pistachios add crunch.
- \*\*Chocolate Chips or Chunks\*\*: These can bring layers of richness.
- \*\*Crushed Cookies\*\*: Dairy-free cookies or graham crackers add delightful bits of flavor and texture.
- \*\*Coconut Flakes\*\*: Unsweetened shredded coconut can contribute to a tropical vibe.

### Let It Ripen

Once your ice cream base is mixed, letting it ripen can deepen flavors. Allow it to sit in the freezer for a few hours or overnight before serving. This resting period helps the flavors meld together, creating a smoother and richer taste.

### Churn Wisely

Using an ice cream maker can give your dairy-free treat a lovely texture. However, if you don‚Äôt have one, you can freeze the mix in a shallow container, stirring every 30-60 minutes until it‚Äôs fully set. This method helps prevent ice crystal formation and promotes a creamier ice cream.

### Store Properly

How you store your ice cream can also affect flavor. Keep it in an airtight container to prevent freezer burn and maintain its delicious taste. Additionally, always let it sit at room temperature for a few minutes before scooping; this allows it to soften slightly and enhances your tasting experience.

With these tips in mind, you can create dairy-free ice cream that not only stands out but surpasses the flavor of store-bought options. Enjoy the process of experimenting and savor the delightful results!
