when I got it, I repotted it from the nursery pot to the 7 inch pot, and used the same soil from the nursery plus a little mix of coco coir + orchid bark + horticultural charcoal. it was doing well, put out new leaves etc. the lower baby leaves were yellowing a couple months later so I cut them off once fully yellowed. I read that that‚Äôs part the growth process so I figured it was fine. 

about 3-4 months ago its roots were so grown they literally broke open the 7 inch pot so I repotted it to the current one. I used again the same soil it was in (roots looked healthy), and added some coco coir + orchid bark mix (no extra charcoal this time). 

a mature leaf from each stem yellowed not long after I repotted it, which I eventually cut.  the leaves are much lighter now and I recently just had to cut another leaf off each stem since they were yellowed. 

I let her mostly dry out between waterings and keep it near a south-facing window (it‚Äôs just a gloomy day so picture doesn‚Äôt show how bright it gets). she hasn‚Äôt put out new leaves since being repotted and I‚Äôm afraid she‚Äôs unhappy. she‚Äôs gotten lighter. the leaf towards the front on the top left in the second pic looks like it‚Äôs starting to yellow at the tips :( 

is the soil mix too dense? is she not getting enough nutrients because of all the coco coir? is the pot too big? I also read they like nitrogen so I added a sprinkle of used coffee grounds on the soil a couple of weeks ago, and last week just started watering her with a 30-10-10 fertilizer. I also have a worm tea concentrate. should I water her with that? also she is fairly close to my AC unit and might be annoyed with the blasts of cold air from it (although it doesn‚Äôt blow directly on her).

1kip0o6,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1kip0o6/how_do_you_deal_with_nihilism/,How do you deal with Nihilism?,"There are days when I wake up, kind of ""Naturally Pre-Disposed to this Experience"". 

Not that I want to go through that per se. But I wake up, immersed in this Spiral. The ""Nihilistic Spiral"". 

I wake up like this. And this feeling is ""sucking me down the drain"".

It starts with Light Sensations and even ""Silly"", as soon as I wake up. 

- A certain Coldness.

- A certain Frigidity.

- A certain Emotional Withdrawal.

- A certain Apathy. 

- A certain Generalized Disinterest.

- A certain Existential Void. 

- The feeling that ""nothing matters"".


Sometimes I wake up feeling all of this.

In a very light way.

In Very Mild Degrees. 


But ""From Grain to Grain, the Rooster Fills the Talk"".


Start Light. But, if I ignore this, or just let it run on ""Auto"". 

These sensations become somatized. 

Until I bury myself. And Paralyze me.


Like Quicksand. 


I can't stop Nihilism from occurring to me sometimes. He always appears without my authorization. But, with time, practice, experience, a lot of reflection and a lot of research. Little by little I learned to deal with this experience. Without giving me too much despair. And at the same time, without being Neglectful with this Sensation. Well, ignoring it only makes it worse. ""Closing Your Eyes"" Doesn't Solve the Problem.

In These Moments. I try to hold on to something, anything, minimally significant. Simple things, like carefully tasting a cup of coffee. Paying attention to the smallest details. 

I try to hallucinate something.

Anything. 

That makes me feel like I'm Alive. 

And it's worth it, to be Alive. 


I try to connect with people, interact, share my feelings and thoughts. Well, I know that isolating myself also only makes this feeling worse.

In those moments. Depending on the Degree of Nihilism. My Soul gets so Desperate for Meaning. That sometimes I can give birth to a Creative Fury within me. I feel taken by an Intense Inspiration. Which Symbolizes my Inner Struggle, against Nihilism. 

A Bold Reaction. Against Emotional and Existential Drowning. 

An attempt to ""Create Sense from Zero"".

""Getting Milk from Stone"". 


Because, everyone who goes through a Nihilistic Experience, Knows. How difficult it is to find Meaning in these moments. And it is precisely, through this Experience, that we have the Opportunity to Give New Meaning to our Existence. And notice things we had never noticed before.  

Because, whoever feels happy easily and through superficial things. It has everything, even if it has nothing.

The Nihilist Fall. Destroy this Paradise. And Challenges us to Rebuild our Happiness from Scratch.

It's a Nagging Discomfort. 

A Demanding Teacher.

That Forces us to Discover and Produce, Infinite Paths to Happiness. 

Well, none of them are fully sufficient. 

You always fall again. 


And this is how we learn:

- Always Starting Over.

- Always reinvent yourself.

- Be Creative.

- Expand Consciousness. 

- Go Beyond. 


Nihilism is the Father of Resilience.

He Breaks us. To Compel Reconstruction.

""What doesn't kill me, only makes me stronger.""


And after a while of going through it. I realized that the Fall is my greatest source of Growth. 

""Suffering Makes Man Great.""

Falling does not mean ""Lose"". 

Falling is what forces us to learn to fly. 

That's what the Abyss is for. 


Agent Falls by accident. 

But, as we fall, a certain Light grows within us. A certain Grace. A Burning Sensation. 

I call this Inspiration.

The ""Inner Call"". To Transcend.

An Active Way to Deal with Nihilism. 

Coming from the Perception that every Fall Reflects a Long-Term Evolution. 

The Fall is uncomfortable at the time. 

But, it is thanks to the discomfort caused by it, that we strive to Grow. 

What would become of me...

Without each of my Sufferings? 


All my Maturity came from them. 



Therefore, I learned to see Nihilism as an Opportunity. A Sort of Demanding Teacher. 

The one that brings you down. And it doesn't help you.

Well, he believes in his potential.

To Stand Up Alone. 


He is a Teacher for Mature People.

She invited me to a club with her group of friends and said it's $50 if I decide to go because they're getting bottles. I asked if I could let her know day of and she said of course. Today I decided not to go and because my friend just got a cat and is struggling with vet bills, she asked me to pay her regardless and said 'usually you know i'd cover you, but i have a lot of vet bills with the cat.' but I don't get why I have to pay to stay at home in bed and not drink any alcohol.

I pay for my friends gym membership ($30/month on top of mine and it's specifically for her only and she knows this). I buy her a starbucks or coffee every time she picks me up to go to the gym (5 minutes out of her way) and if she drives somewhere further I insist on giving her gas money because I thought we were the type of healthy friendship that isn't tit for tat with money.

But I don't like friendships where I have to ask for money and focus on sending them money. Then she knows I'm going through my first heartbreak right now (from being assaulted) and am going through a lot of sexual harassment at work and she said 'I'm still here if you need me' so I just responded (not nice of me) 'lol, I have other people, thank you.'

Maybe I'm overreacting but I just wanna protect my peace and if no one will spoil me then I'll do it myself and I cant do that when I'm giving all my money to my friends and they never cover me on anything and charge me for events I dont go to.

Also when I had my birthday dinner I told everyone to rsvp cause I said if they dont show, per the restaurant policy, it will be a $25 no show fee per person but they have 4 hours to cancel with no fee so just let me know, after that I will have to charge them because I am not willing to cover anyone who cancels. That I made clear that they will have to pay if they cancel. But that is for the people who rsvp first.

I made it clear I wasnt sure and if I knew I'd have to pay if I decided day of (which my friend said was fine) then I would have said no initially so now I feel like I'm scammed out of money.

Also I work as a cook and my friend makes more than me. She makes 23$/hr and she knows I make $20/hr because we've discussed it because she was shocked since I work at a really impressive and fancy restaurant. I live paycheck to paycheck.

Our tables have baskets with general dining things they need such as tea bags, sugars, salt & pepper. When I started working here in October, the baskets also included coffee creamers and butters. Over the last few months, residents were discovering the creamers and butters on their tables had expired.

Therefore, last month the big boss implemented a rule that the creamers and butters are not allowed in the baskets, residents must ask for them off the drink cart. Residents took offense to this and started asking for more than they need to begin stockpiling the creamers and butters.

Big Boss Lady goes a weekly sweep of both dining rooms, and if she finds any creamers or butters in any baskets, she puts them in a pile on our kitchen counter with a note telling the companions and assistants that it is against the rules to keep these things on the tables.

Just this week, the residents have gotten bold enough to call me stupid to my face when I tell them I'm not allowed to keep creamers and butters on the table. I've been here long enough to have a decent memory of which residents use creamers with their coffees to leave the number they use at their seat, but when they show up they will have squirreled the creamers away and ask for more.

My supervisor is aware of this behavior, and feels the need to remind me every day that creamers and butters are not allowed in the baskets.

1kiowqn,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1kiowqn/aitah_for_not_planning_a_big_surprise_for_my/,AITAH for not planning a big surprise for my sister's bachelorette party and disappointing her?,"My (25 F) Sister (30) is getting married this summer, she asked me to be her MoH, and the Bachelorette trip is less than a week away. Sorry if this is kind of all over the place- This is my first reddit post (although I am a consistent lurker), and a lot has happened in the past year since her engagement.

For some background, my sister is very type A and likes/needs things done in a very specific way. We are opposite in almost every way. I have struggled with anxiety and depression my entire life, along with inattentive adhd- meaning I am not very organized, struggle with self motivation, and a host of other things. For even more context, my sister has a long history of being disappointed by not just me but everyone. It seems that no one can really ever live up to her unspoken expectations and what she feels like she deserves (because she typically goes *way* above and beyond for others). That might seem harsh, but in general she tends to have unrealistic expectations of the people around her with little empathy to what others are experiencing.¬†

Now I know starting off this way may make it seem like she and I have a bad relationship. We actually get along a majority of the time and have been really good friends for the past 3-4 years. Of course we fight (I assume like most sisters do) and there have been periods where we haven‚Äôt been very close, but I have always really looked up to her. I really admire her dedication, how organized she is, and just her ability to get so much done.¬†

When she and I started talking about the bachelorette party, she expressed she wanted the trip to ‚Äònot feel like a bachelorette trip, but give the vibes of an influencer trip‚Äô.¬† I tried to have a very upfront conversation about what her expectations are/were and expressed my fear that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to plan a party/trip that would meet her expectations. I‚Äôve never hosted anything or planned a trip, and I have only been in one wedding before, which was my brother‚Äôs wedding when I was 14.

So the conversation ended with us planning it together, she would be focusing on all the big details and my role would be more focusing on the games, designs, and just kind of talking things through with her...Or so I thought.

A couple months go by and the day after my birthday we had a conversation where she cried telling me how disappointed she was with me and how she ‚Äòthought I would at least try‚Äô. This coming after months of talking on the phone every day or every couple days for *at least* an hour about the trip, most of the time during my work day, on top of constantly talking with her about the actual wedding planning. I was hurt as I felt like I was putting everything I could into helping her plan things (while also trying to keep my head above water at work) but hearing that it wasn‚Äôt enough and that I had let her down sent me into not a great mental space. I was also confused because it felt like her expectations of me had changed throughout the planning and her saying some very hurtful things to me was the first I heard that I wasn‚Äôt doing exactly what she wanted me to be doing.¬†

After our fight- which never really got resolved- I said that I would try harder but the way she went about telling me she needed more was pretty hurtful, and we ended things there. I researched restaurants, bars, clubs, coffee shops, bakeries at our trip location and put¬† them into her spreadsheet with relevant info, booked a van to take us to a boat charter, booked a beach bonfire - (when she saw the spreadsheet she condescendingly said ‚Äòwhaaat? Omggg wowww look at you!‚Äô) I realized that she didn't see any of my previous actions as me trying or caring because I wasn't doing things the way she does things. Once I started using the spreadsheet, that seemed to make her happy. But within the fight she had said ‚ÄòI keep thinking to myself like is she doing anything, is she planning me a bunch of surprises for when we get down there?‚Äù

Now I‚Äôm incredibly stressed and feel like she‚Äôs expecting some kind of big surprise but I have no idea what to do. The game I‚Äôve created will be a surprise (with a cameo from one of her favorite reality tv stars) and we are doing a lingerie party, but other than that she knows about all the other activities we are doing. She doesn‚Äôt want decorations (just flowers), strippers, or anything that is from a traditional bachelorette party, because again- 'this shouldn‚Äôt feel like a bachelorette party, it should feel like an influencer trip'.¬†

My sister has expensive taste and early on she knew that she wasn‚Äôt going to be comfortable with asking the bridal party to pay for the trip she wanted. So she picked a number she was comfortable asking of everyone and she and I said we would split the rest of the costs.

I‚Äôve looked into a few things like getting a masseuse to come to our rental, having a decoration company come in to do non-cheugy decorations, getting a bartender to come for one of the nights in- but everything is so expensive. This trip is the most I‚Äôve spent on anything ever, and I‚Äôve already dipped into so much of the savings I‚Äôve been trying to build up. Thinking of asking the rest of the bridal party to contribute even an extra 100 on something for her gives me so much anxiety cause the economy is rough out there and I‚Äôve only met one other person that is going - but I do know the financial status varies pretty widely across the group.¬†

## key Features Analysis

The best 5x7 rugs of 2025 offer a compelling blend of durability, aesthetics, and functionality. From material quality to design innovations, these rugs stand out in a crowded market of options.

**Size and Dimensions:** Precisely measured at 5 feet by 7 feet (60 inches by 84 inches), this standard rug size is versatile, fitting well in apartments, condos, and smaller rooms without overwhelming the space. This exact sizing makes placement straightforward, whether it's under a coffee table, beside a bed, or defining a seating area.

**Material Composition:** High-quality rugs feature materials such as wool, cotton, synthetic fibers (polypropylene, polyester, nylon), or blends. Wool rugs offer luxurious softness, durability, and natural stain resistance. Synthetic rugs are more affordable, easy to clean, and frequently enough resistant to fading and wear, making them ideal for high-traffic areas. The composition directly impacts the rug's feel, lifespan, and maintenance requirements.

**Weave and Construction:** The weave type influences the rug's texture, density, and overall durability. Options include hand-knotted, hand-tufted, machine-made, and flatweave. Hand-knotted rugs are the most labor-intensive and expensive, offering unparalleled detail and longevity. machine-made rugs provide affordability and consistency in design. Flatweave rugs are lightweight and reversible, ideal for casual settings.

**Design and Style:** 5x7 rugs come in a wide array of designs, from conventional Persian and Oriental patterns to modern geometric and abstract styles. The color palettes range from neutral tones to vibrant hues, catering to diverse aesthetic preferences. Whether you're aiming for a classic, minimalist, bohemian, or eclectic look, there's a 5x7 rug to complement your existing decor.

**Pile Height and Density:** Pile height refers to the length of the rug fibers, ranging from low-pile (less than 0.25 inches) to high-pile (over 0.75 inches). Low-pile rugs are easier to clean and suitable for high-traffic areas and under furniture. High-pile rugs offer plush comfort underfoot but require more maintenance. Pile density, or the closeness of the fibers, impacts the rug's durability and feel.

**Backing Material:** The backing material provides structural support and prevents the rug from slipping. Common backing materials include jute, cotton, latex, and synthetic rubber. Latex backings offer excellent grip but may not be suitable for individuals with latex allergies. Jute backings are natural and eco-friendly but may require a rug pad for added cushioning and stability.

Key features of the best 5x7 rugs include:

* Precisely sized for versatile room placement
* Durable materials for long-lasting use
* Variety of weaves to suit different needs

## Core Benefits

Choosing the right 5x7 rug can transform a room, adding not just visual appeal but also practical benefits that enhance your living space.**Enhanced Aesthetics:** A well-chosen 5x7 rug ties together the elements of a room, creating a cohesive and visually appealing space. It defines seating areas, adds a pop of color or texture, and enhances the overall style of your home.For instance, a vibrant geometric rug can bring a modern touch to a minimalist living room, while a traditional Persian rug can add warmth and elegance to a dining area.

**Improved Comfort:** Rugs provide a soft and comfortable surface underfoot, making your living spaces more inviting and cozy. A plush 5x7 rug in a bedroom can make getting out of bed in the morning a more pleasant experience. Moreover, rugs can reduce noise levels by absorbing sound, creating a quieter and more peaceful environment.

**Floor Protection:** A 5x7 rug protects your flooring from scratches, dents, and wear in high-traffic areas. This is especially beneficial for hardwood floors, which can be easily damaged by furniture and foot traffic. By placing a rug in key areas, you can preserve the beauty and integrity of your flooring for years to come.**Defined Space:** In open-concept homes, a 5x7 rug can effectively define different zones, such as a living room seating area or a dining space. This helps to create a sense of order and institution in a large, open space. For example, a rug can delineate the boundaries of a seating area, making it feel more intimate and contained.

**Increased Safety:** Rugs can improve safety by providing traction and preventing slips and falls, especially on hard floors. A rug with a non-slip backing or a rug pad can provide extra stability, reducing the risk of accidents. This is particularly critically important in homes with children or elderly individuals.

**Cost Efficiency:** While a high-quality rug may require an initial investment, it proves economical over time by protecting your floors. Replacing damaged flooring can be significantly more expensive than maintaining a rug. Additionally, a durable rug can last for many years, providing ongoing value and comfort.

## FAQs Section

choosing the right 5x7 rug involves considering several factors. Here are some frequently asked questions to guide you in your decision-making process.

**What is the best material for a 5x7 rug in a high-traffic area?**
Synthetic materials like polypropylene and nylon are excellent choices for high-traffic areas. They are durable, stain-resistant, easy to clean, and relatively affordable. Wool is also a good option for its durability and stain resistance, but it requires more careful maintenance. Avoid delicate materials like silk or viscose in high-traffic zones.

**How should I clean and maintain my 5x7 rug?**
regular vacuuming is essential to remove dirt and debris. For spills, blot instantly with a clean cloth. Avoid rubbing, as this can spread the stain. Depending on the material, you may need to spot clean with a mild detergent or have the rug professionally cleaned.Consider using a rug pad to prevent slippage and protect the rug from wear.

**Can a 5x7 rug work in a small living room?**
Yes, a 5x7 rug is an ideal size for a small living room. It can anchor your furniture and define the seating area without overwhelming the space. Position the rug so that the front legs of your sofa and chairs are on the rug, creating a cohesive and inviting arrangement.

**What type of rug pad should I use with my 5x7 rug?**
Choose a rug pad that is slightly smaller than the rug itself to prevent it from being visible. Non-slip rug pads made of rubber or felt are excellent for preventing slippage and protecting your flooring. Consider the thickness of the rug pad based on your desired level of cushioning and the pile height of your rug.

I started with an anaerobic natural from Black Fox that has a distinctive taste that I am quite familiar with. I bought a new bag, and divided it evenly into four containers: the bag it came in (control), a Fellow Electric Atmos (vacuum), a Planetary Design Airscape (no suction, but excess air removed), and a standard mason jar. 

I intended to taste the coffee after a couple of weeks, and then a month, but life got in the way and I ended up trying the coffee after about 2 months recently. 

Here are my results from worst to besr:

Mason jar: By far the worst, tasted very stale and bitter, probably due to the extra air in the top 3/4 of the jar. The jar released some CO2 fairly suddenly when opened. 

Electric Atmos: This was surprisingly bad. You would think a $100 thing would make your coffee taste better, but the cups I got out of it were very hollow and just acidic and boring. The coffee also tasted the way the container smells on the inside, which is gross. Almost as bad as the jar. 

Airscape: This one wasn't bad, but wasn't great. Also kind of tasted like the container smelled, and lost a lot of flavor, but was still kind of enjoyable. 

The bag the coffee came in: I really enjoyed the coffee from the bag! It retained all of the flavor that I love about this particular coffee. Very fruity and juicy and enjoyable with none of the negative tastes from the other 3. 

TL;DR: Just store your coffee in the bag it came in. It's free and noticably much better than every other storage method",16,1746813227.0,pourover,10,1.0,False

And what happens? Downvotes.

Seriously, what is with that mentality? You're genuinely trying to contribute, offer a different perspective, or cover a potential base, and you get met with negativity for no apparent reason. It's like some people don't even read to understand the intent, or they just reflexively downvote anything that isn't the exact answer they had in their head, even if other possibilities are valid.

It's incredibly frustrating and, frankly, makes you wonder why you should even bother trying to help in some online communities. If a simple attempt to assist is met with that kind of reaction, it really makes you question the point. It feels like some people are just determined to misunderstand or are incapable of grasping a simple, well-intentioned suggestion.

Does anyone else experience this? It's baffling and makes you think twice about engaging. It's like, I was just trying to help, and this is the response? It almost makes you feel like some people aren't worth the effort if they can't even appreciate a simple attempt to assist or engage in a constructive way. ü§¶

But I can't find a style or color that really fits without making it look like an old lady's house (note: the dining room is getting repainted, likely in a sage-ish green on top and white on bottom). I also can't decide what coordinating colors I want for my accent pillows on the couch, or what color rug under the coffee table may help liven the place up.

I've also been considering painting the fireplace wall of the living room either a terracotta orange-red, or the same sage green as I'm planning in the dining room, or a lighter neutral beige that will still contrast enough with the fireplace and the sandy tan in the rest of the house. I'm thinking a light cream colored, or perhaps sage, curtain would go best in any of these cases. I attached a living room inspiration photo and a photo of some color swatches in the dining room. Having thought about it more though, given that it's not a super large living room (16x15'), I'm thinking a lighter colored accent wall would be better than darker.

Prior to taking WEGOVY, I loved to drink coffee, specially lattes. I owned a very expensive espresso machine and made my own lattes. I would drink two a day and sometimes three.

After I started taking WEGOVY, lattes started tasting different. The sweetness went away and I was pretty much just tasting the bitterness. Also it really upset my stomach. So, I could only drink a latte in the morning and even that was less enjoyable and done more out of habit than anything else.

It has been five months since I stopped and my love of the taste of a good latte has not returned. Also, I still get nauseous from drinking it before I‚Äôm even done, so I don‚Äôt even finish the latte sometimes.

Anyone else experience this? I am afraid that, since it hasn‚Äôt gone away by now, it is going to be a permanent change‚Ä¶ üò¢",1,1746812878.0,WegovyWeightLoss,0,1.0,False

Meaursault‚Äôs detachment is justifiable, I may not have ‚Äúexperienced‚Äù life to the fullest as what others may term it but we can all agree life is full of unexpected coincidences. Yes, he was indifferent to everything that he surrounded himself with but he was functioning. He didn‚Äôt wallow in self-pity just like the Underground man from Dostoevsky.  


It made me thought that what if we actually distance ourselves from the events that happen in front of us and just ‚Äúlet it be?‚Äù after all Meursault took a life just because of the sun. He was indifferent to his gf‚Äôs feelings and lastly he wanted everyone to look at him while he stands ready for execution. 

I realized if we approach life in Meursault‚Äôs view it‚Äôs either we wallow ourselves in self-pity or see it as Freedom. I see it the latter, Im definitely gonna read this book again and for now I just want coffee ",1,1746812769.0,u_akonglola69,0,1.0,False

Would it be a horrible idea to reach out and apologize for disappearing? It's not necessarily a company I want to work for again in the future, but I really liked my manager/mentor and would love to try and reconnect.

1kiojmy,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kiojmy,The 420 Sticker Giveaway Unboxing,"Greetings, Ator, The Fightin' Eagle here. I was the lucky sombiatch who won the 420 weekend Grindhouse sticker giveaway, sponsored by TeenageDraculerX.  I thought I'd do an unboxing so everyone could check out the loot and join me in reveling in a rare moment of victory for old Ator.

The stickers fell into two categories, 420 Grindhouse-specific stickers (of which the Tales from the Crypt comic styled one is my personal favorite, along with the 420 Grindhouse banners copped from the bumper trailers).  There were also a fine selection of dispo and product stickers like you in the legal states get when you go to 420 events at your favorite purveyors of cannabis products.  

There's also a Heavy 16 coaster, which I plan on using as a bong coaster to protect my coffee table from those unsightly bong rings.  Additionally, TDX threw in some nacho cheese, perfect for when the munchies kick in.  The spaceman Jeebus plate was mine but necessary because the package the stickers came in was a bit mushed and the one pack of nacho cheese was a bit leaky.  The plate itself was created by a friend of mine, avant garde artist Shane Swank.  My set of Spaceman Jeebus plates are a fixture on Grindhouse nights due to the celebration of the weird and wacky arts.  

I'm excited about the stickers, as the summer wears on into the fall, I'll be doing a series of shows at prominent midwest music clubs and I intend to leave a trail of 420 Grindhouse stickers in the various dressing rooms and stages to spread the word far and wide about our fun hang.

I don't think the 2 are a great combo lol. I would like to at least try an alternative to see if that helps. What do you guys have in the morning instead of something sugary/caffeine? Protein shakes?

This simple practice not only boosts emotional well-being but also improves mental resilience and outlook.

How are you! üòä Just wanted to say a big thanks to everyone who commented on my last post about filament waste. I honestly learned so much from all the replies ‚Äî really appreciate it!

A lot of people mentioned that waste becomes a serious issue in print farms, so I thought I‚Äôd ask:

*  **If you're running a print farm**, how do you handle all the leftover filament, failed prints, and support waste? Is it just part of the job, or are there strategies to reduce/reuse that actually work?

Also, I had a super interesting chat with a friend who works in a 3D printing research lab ‚Äî they use this crazy expensive ABS filament for testing, and he‚Äôs been thinking of DIY his own version to save costs. That got me thinking‚Ä¶

Has anyone here **tried making your own custom filaments**? Like coffee-infused, conductive, glow-in-the-dark, etc.?

* What went well?
* What went wrong?
* And any comment!

It shall be great to hear any fun stories, tips or even weird results!

1kio6ba,https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/1kio6ba/my_treatment_resistant_depression_is_coming_back/,My treatment resistant depression is coming back,"I am on disability since I can't really work. I missed too many days at work, I can't seem to succeed and it makes me sad because I studied so hard for this job. During my internship I missed many days too, even at my old jobs when I was younger and already medicated. I just can't handle it. Even though I was fired from my last job because I missed too many days, at least it gave me a routine and made me feel more energetic.

Right now I feel the depression coming back even though I am on an antidepressant and my antipsychotic use to work to treat my treatment resistant depression. It's the kind of depression that slows you down, want to make you sleep until noon and stay in bed all day scrolling social media, I don't eat that much or I eat junk food, I don't exercise and I am surviving on coffee. Since starting olanzapine I am now at 220lbs, before that I was 110lbs. I don't care too much about the beauty standards but in my younger years I used to exercise a lot and now seeing I can't even climb the stairs without getting out of breath and suffering from joint pain while walking short distance is depressing.
 
I've got my safety plan ready : I force myself to have a routine; I go to sleep and wake up at the same hour each day. I am succeeding in that even though I wish I could sleep all day to avoid being awake. I brush my teeth in the morning and before bed, I shower at least once a day. I go out at least once a day, I clean my place twice a week (I have pets so it gets dirty easily), I do my laundry.
I made a full schedule and I try to go out at least 5 hours a day, I enrolled in charity work next to my place. My schedule is full to be honest, I am busy all day because I have goals I want to reach, I wish I could add exercising to it but it feels too much right now. But then, at the end of the day I ask myself : Is it worth it? Why am I here? What am I doing? 

It feels like high fuctionning depression. Tomorrow I have a meeting and I just don't want to go but I know I have to do it otherwise it just means staying in bed all day, crying and staring at the ceiling. But yeah, I don't know, I know it seems I handle it well but I have 10 years of experience with this. At least even though the meds don't stop the depression altogether it keeps me sane enough to do things, being a very organised person helps too. But I keep asking myself :

1kio6aj,https://www.reddit.com/r/WaltDisneyWorld/comments/1kio6aj/my_comprehensive_guide_to_ll_multipass_plus_our/,My comprehensive guide to LL Multipass (plus our ultra top secret (not really) forbidden technique)!,"Hey all! I wanted to make this guide to share our strategies with LL Multipass. I found that there was a ton of online content about this, but much of it was outdated, convoluted, or just not comprehensive enough. This guide is specifically to maximize the amount of attractions you can pull off in a day as quickly as possible, and won't be for everybody. I'd recommend avoiding this if you have kids or parties larger than 4. The only caveat is that it may require a bit of backtracking and lots of steps, but as the day goes on you can begin to shape your choices around minimizing the amount of steps you take/around your other reservations. A lot of this may seem confusing in advance, but will make perfect sense when the day comes. Big shoutout to Ear Scouts, Touring Plans, and Thrill Data for their incredible info.

**Part 1 - Pre-booking Tier 1s**

So, your first step with LLs is just booking them in advance! If you are at a resort, you can book 7 days in advance, whereas without a resort reservation it's 3 days in advance. Note that this allows you to book your *entire* trip, not just the days within a week out! We could even do this with a split stay (5 totally separate reservations). Because of this, we planned to hit the busier parks (namely MK and HS) towards the end of our trip as fewer people were able to book LLs for those days yet, which was definitely evident with how easy it was to get tough-to-grab Tier 1 slots.

  
I see my pre-booking strategy as a bit of a 'multi-layered' approach. You are allowed to book three LLs in advance per day, where one is a 'Tier 1' attraction and two are 'Tier 2' attractions. At its core, all this means is you can book one high demand ride and two lower demand rides. You can google which attractions are Tier 1 per park to plan around this. Before you choose which Tier 1 to grab, decide if you are going to rope-drop (and If you *are* rope dropping, be sure to rope drop a Tier 1 or an Individual LL attraction). When booking, your first priority is to get the earliest possible timeslot on the best possible Tier 1 attraction. If you can't get the highest demand Tier 1 timeslot within 1.5-2 hours of park open, it could be worth booking a slightly lower demand Tier 1 and just rope dropping the more popular one (though this isn't completely necessary, and I'll go into more detail later). 

  
I'd recommend the following for each park: 

  
\-Tiana's for MK (alternatively either Jungle Cruise or Peter Pan)

  
\-Slinky Dog Dash for HS (alternatively you can get a very early Runaway Railway, but as far as demand goes none come close to Slinky)

  
\-Either Remy's or Frozen for EPCOT (if you ride one and rope drop the other, you've essentially done 90% of the legwork for the entire day. Enjoy a pyramid margarita and hit the other rides whenever you want). *Note that this will likely change with Test Track reopening, and I'd recommend booking that over either of these two when it does, assuming it's a Multi-Pass attraction.*

  
Overall, the key thing to take away is that any moderately good Tier 1 that is in the AM should be totally fine. You can keep checking into the app to see if any earlier slots open up, but this usually only happens as it gets closer and closer to the day itself.

  
**Part 2 - Pre-booking Tier 2s**

  
So, Tier 2s are a little different. Best case scenario, you have at least one **right at the beginning of the day**. This is because scanning *any* LL, Tier 1 or Tier 2, allows you to book LLs of any Tier and at any park. This is extremely helpful, as it usually takes an hour or two for the Tier 1 timeslots to start to get seriously booked up. If you can't find a Tier 2 you care about within 30-45 minutes of park open, I'd recommend getting a REALLY easy ride to get a LL for and scanning it ASAP. You don't even need to watch the show/ride the ride if you don't want to and can just leave the line - just make sure the LL goes away in the app when you scan as *some rides have two scanning points that need to be hit before the LL is considered used.* 



It was helpful for us to look it like this: 1 of your Tier 2s is a ride you actually want to ride/has a longer line (we'll call this a **Power Tier 2**), and the other Tier 2 is simply to unlock the ability to book any LL as soon as possible (I've heard this called a **Passkey Tier 2** before, so I'll just use that). Ideally, they are both rides you like and have longer lines, *but* if that is out of the cards, having a **Passkey Tier 2** within the first 30-45 minutes of park open is the most important thing.

  
Great **Power Tier 2s** to consider are: 

  
\-Haunted Mansion, Pirates, or Winnie the Pooh for Magic Kingdom

  
\-Tower of Terror or Toy Story Mania for HS (though I'd say Tower is *marginally* more desirable)

  
\-Kiliminjaro Safaris > Na'vi River > Everest for AK 

  
\-Any Tier 2s you like for Epcot - Spaceship Earth may have been *slightly* less available, so perhaps consider that?

  
Great **Passkey Tier 2s** for each park are:

  
\-Teacups or Aladdin for MK as they are very short and in relatively close proximity to other high wait-time rides

  
\-The stages shows or Swirling Saucers at HS as they are very easy to get (and the latter is very short if you actually want to use these LLs to experience the attraction)

  
\-Everest at AK (it was VERY easy to get this first thing in the morning and can actually get a pretty long standby line during the day)

  
\-Anything at EPCOT - I'd just choose the one the shortest distance from your other LLs

  
**Part 3 - In-park booking**

  
So, you got your LLs all set up and are at the parks in the morning. Whether you end up rope dropping or not doesn't change the core strategy, it may just make executing it a bit easier. The first thing to do is gauge how much time you have before your first LL - if you are through the gates just before your first LL, beeline it there and scan it ASAP. If you have 30+ minutes before your timeslot, definitely see if you can knock out another ride in the meantime. Choose one that is relatively close to your first LL (for us, we had a Tower of Terror LL at 9:30 so we rode both Runaway Railway and Rock'n Rollercoaster and got breakfast and coffee before it was time to scan in). Note you can scan up to 5 minutes early with no issue, so it's best to scan in EXACTLY 5 minutes before the listed time. 

  
Once you scan your first LL, its off to the races. You'll want to be refreshing the app to focus on high-priority ride LLs during the day. I found that almost all of them had fairly frequent drops throughout the day, with some being as close as 15-30 minutes out from booking. The ideal scenario is booking one ASAP that you can get to fairly quickly after getting off your first ride (for us, we did Toy Story Mania right after Tower as that allowed us to make a nice, leisurely line towards Galaxy's Edge). 

  
There are two ways a LL can drop throughout the day - either somebody cancels theirs, or WDW releases some extra ones. For the latter, we found that [Thrill Data](https://www.thrill-data.com/lightning-lane/wdw/popup) had fairly accurate drop times throughout the day. If you don't feel like looking through all of that, we found refreshing when the clock showed either XX:X4 or XX:X9 netted us solid results. Cancellations can happen at any time, and happened pretty commonly throughout the day for us! 

  
Not all refreshing methods are created equal, though. I'd say there are three major ways to refresh for LLs, and I'll go from most to least effective. **Please note these not only work for just booking the LL outright, but also modifying the LL to get better times:**

  
3) Going to the Tip Board, refreshing the page, then scrolling down to the LL(s) you want to check in question. This is helpful as it requires no pre-prep and you can see every single LL available for that park. The reason it is less effective, though, is that in the time it takes for you to scroll and find the LL you want, it could already have been snapped up by another person. I am pretty fast with this stuff so it wasn't a huge issue for me, but I'd still recommend the other methods when possible.

  
2) By going to the ""My Day"" tab, you can use Disney's automated Genie day planner to lay out an idea as to what your day can look like. I don't find this very helpful at all as we are relatively experienced with the parks, however, *one function is very useful.* By doing Genie day planning, you can select a few rides you are interested in. Upon doing so, the day planner will list these rides **at the top of the page**. This allows you to quickly refresh and immediately see if a LL has popped up. This is great, as you don't need to scroll down to find the attraction you want. I'd recommend only choosing 1 or 2 rides for this, as any more requires a bit more scrolling. The only downsides to this method are that you don't actually have a guaranteed LL slot, and that you aren't looking at the tip board that shows all of the other potential LLs.

  
1) So, sometimes you can *get* a LL for a ride you want, but it will be way too far out for you to want to use. This is fine, and I still recommend you book it even if you don't want it that late. When you book a LL (or multiple), your daily tab will put them in a nice handy central view. From here, you can then **tap on the LL you want, and click modify time.** You are then presented with a drop-down option to see other available times the LL will be available at. **Every time you click this menu, it will immediately refresh the available times for that specific ride.** You can now keep clicking this drop down menu to refresh multiple times *per second*. The entire refresh process is FAR faster than the above methods, and will almost guarantee that you can snap up these times faster than anybody else. The only downsides are that you need a LL to begin with (which is never too tough to get by using the above methods), and you can only see one ride at a time. **However, by using this method, I was able to get perfect lightning lane slots within 2-7 minutes of starting the process for even the most desirable rides.** Note that it times out after 5 minutes, but you can very easily just back out and click Modify again.

  
By using these methods, we were able to 'complete' each park by **12-2 PM each day.** We could then take our time to enjoy the parks stress-free, go back to the resort to rest, or begin hopping over to other parks to knock them out! We even managed to do Animal Kingdom and 90% of Magic Kingdom within one day, and we didn't even really need to spend over 3-4 hours at each park. It was so nice to know we would always have plenty of time in the evenings to enjoy low-key Dole Whip, parades, fireworks, or dinner reservations! 

\----------------------------------------------------------------

  
To conclude, I recognize these methods may not be a good fit for everybody. It takes a lot of walking, and is best for smaller parties of people who enjoy min-maxing their day/being as efficient as possible. However, I gotta say - we were apprehensive about the new LL system, but IMO its the most effective one so far. I found myself spending **far less time in-app** during our park days, to the point where I rarely spent over 20 minutes a day looking for LLs. 

  
Some additional (and possibly unrelated) tips, tricks, and the *forbidden method* (ooOOOoooHHHh, spooky): 

  
\-Mobile ordering lunch and snacks is your friend. Whether it was sit-down or just a snack on the go, by ordering in advance we were able to immediately get to a restaurant, get our food as soon as we hit the counter, take our time to eat then get back at it. Just be sure to check 'I am here' as soon as you can (but don't be a jerk about it/actually make sure you can reach the counter by the time your food is ready)

  
\-If you aren't in love with fireworks, I'd recommend hitting high-priority attractions or leaving the parks during them. This cuts ride/transport wait times down a huge degree. 

  
\-Be nice to CMs. Seriously. They bust their butts in blistering heat and do it with a smile. Plus, they *want to help you out*. Be friendly when you have asks, and chances are they will do all they can to help out. We missed a LL due to a tour once and they were willing to let us in after it, which meant the world to us (that said, don't be like us - be punctual!)

  
\-Rope dropping, while valuable, isn't the end-all-be-all it used to be! We used to get up at the crack of dawn to be the literal *first people in line.* This trip, we took it much easier and usually got there only 30 minutes out, if we rope dropped at all! We were even the first boat on Frozen and were stopped for a bag check that took 10 minutes. I'd say its only worth getting there super early if you want to ride ILL rides without paying, or if you want to hit 2+ parks in a day.

  
\-Mousewatcher is, by far, the best way to get dining and tour reservations. It sucks that you need to pay per reservation, but it is far more effective than any of its competitors. We got even the toughest-to-snag tours and dining slots mere days out.

  
\-Touring Plans is a worthwhile investment for many reasons. Their ride wait estimates are far more accurate than the official ones, so I'd highly recommend using them if you plan on hitting standby at any point during the day. However, even their free services are useful. You can see every room's view at WDW resorts, and they can even help submit room requests to get you in ones you like. **Note that, if you either rent or own DVC points, you'll need to call DVC directly to put in these requests - but I can attest they do listen!**

  
\-Now, for the forbidden technique. Be reasonable when you do this/accept 'no' if it doesn't work out. **Please only use this if you are intending to scan then leave line, as you will probably miss your reservation if you actually ride the ride.** So, let's say you have a tour or a reservation early in the morning. Pre-booking doesn't allow you to book LLs within an hour of another reservation. This can be frustrating, as you may want to use a **Passkey Tier 2 LL** 30-45 minutes before another morning reservation. **However, you can circumvent this by using support chat in the My Disney Experience app** to book a LL within an hour of another reservation. **THERE NEEDS TO BE AN ACTUAL AVAILABLE SLOT though**, so please don't bother them asking for a morning LL when the earliest is at 4PM. We had a Keys to the Kingdom tour reservation at 9:30, but were able to get a 9:05 Haunted Mansion LL. Granted, we couldn't scan this as we were already running behind schedule after sleeping in, but theoretically we could have scanned the Haunted Mansion LL that morning and booked other Tier 1 attractions during the tour's lunch/before the tour started. Otherwise, the soonest reservation we could book would have been 2:30 PM! Again, be reasonable about this and don't use it as an excuse to be late to your other commitments.

1kintju,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1kintju/harvest_of_iron/,Harvest of Iron,"The moon hung low over the cypress trees, casting long shadows across the dirt road as Deputy Warren Thibodeaux guided his horse toward the Dupuis homestead. Sweat trickled down his back despite the early hour, the Louisiana summer refusing to yield even to darkness. The call had come just before dawn‚ÄîMabel Jenkins screaming about blood seeping under the Dupuis' front door.

A whip-poor-will called from somewhere deep in the swamp, its cry cutting through the heavy air. Warren's mount snorted, ears flicking nervously as if sensing what lay ahead. They'd passed no other souls on the road since leaving town, just the occasional raccoon scurrying into the underbrush, red eyes reflecting his lantern light. Even the usual night sounds seemed muted, as if the darkness itself held its breath.

Warren had been deputy in Lake Charles for going on three years now. Mostly, he broke up Saturday night fights outside Tanner's saloon or tracked down missing livestock. Murder was rare in these parts‚Äîfolk knew each other too well, carried grudges out in the open where everyone could see. This felt different. Wrong.

""Easy now,"" he murmured to his mount as they approached the whitewashed farmhouse. Lamplight glowed weakly through the curtained windows. Too bright for this hour. Too still.

Warren tied his horse to the fence post and adjusted his gun belt, the weight of his revolver suddenly insufficient against the dread climbing up his throat. The porch steps creaked beneath his boots.

""Mabel?"" he called out. ""You still here?""

A shadow moved on the porch swing. ""Ain't going in there again,"" Mabel's voice trembled. She was a thin woman, hardened by years of field work, but now she looked small, clutching her shawl tight around bony shoulders. ""I knocked and knocked... Marie always answers by the third knock. Always.""

Warren nodded, hand resting on his holster. ""You stay put.""

The doorknob was slick under his palm. Blood. Not much, just a smear, but enough. He pushed the door open, wincing at the protesting hinges.

""Hello? Anybody home? It's Deputy Thibodeaux.""

The front room was undisturbed‚Äîa Bible lay open on the table, an oil lamp burned low. A half-empty glass of what looked like lemonade sat beside an empty plate, crumbs scattered across the blue-checkered cloth. 

Warren moved deeper into the house, the floorboards groaning beneath his weight. The smell hit him first‚Äîcopper and shit and something else, sweet like spoiled meat. His stomach lurched.

""Christ Almighty,"" he whispered as he stepped into the bedroom doorway.

The four-poster bed dominated the room, mosquito netting drawn back like theater curtains revealing the tableau within. Jules Dupuis lay on his back, right arm extended as if reaching for something. His wife Marie was beside him, covers pulled up to her chest, hands folded primly atop the quilt. They might have been sleeping if not for the dark stains spreading beneath their bodies and the odd, sunken quality of their faces.

Jules' skull had been caved in, a wet crater where the forehead should be. Bits of white bone poked through pulped flesh. Marie's face remained largely intact, but the covers concealed the worst of what had been done to her body. A wet darkness spread across the quilt.

Warren stumbled backward, bracing himself against the door frame as bile rose in his throat. He swallowed hard, forcing himself to look again. The lamp in the corner cast everything in a sickly yellow glow, reflecting dully off the wetness.

Something wasn't right. The bodies looked... arranged. Like dolls put to bed by a child.

A creak from down the hallway snapped his attention away. The children's room.

Warren drew his gun, moving slowly down the corridor. The door stood half-open, darkness spilling out.

""Police,"" he called, voice cracking. ""Anyone in there, come out now.""

Silence answered him.

He nudged the door wider with his boot, letting the light from the hallway spill into the room. Two small beds, two small shapes beneath the covers. Too still. Too flat.

""Ah, fuck,"" Warren breathed, holstering his gun with a shaking hand. ""The babies too?""

Little Anne was seven, her brother Thomas only four. Warren had seen them just last Sunday at church, Thomas chasing frogs by the creek afterward while Anne helped her mama lay out the picnic.

He couldn't make himself step fully into the room. From the doorway, he could see enough‚Äîthe same careful arrangement, the same dark stains seeping through white bedsheets. Tiny hands folded over tiny chests.

Warren backed away, stumbling down the hallway and out the front door. He made it to the edge of the porch before vomiting over the railing, his breakfast splattering against Marie's prized hydrangeas.

""They dead?"" Mabel asked, though she clearly knew the answer.

Warren spat, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand. ""All of 'em. Go fetch Sheriff Mouton and Doc Pritchard."" He took a shuddering breath. ""And tell Wilford at the telegram office to send for that newspaper woman from New Orleans‚Äîthe one with the camera.""

Mabel's eyes widened. ""Miss Jameson? You want to put this in the papers?""

Warren gazed back at the quiet house, remembering the bodies laid out like they were sleeping. ""This ain't no regular killing, Mabel. Whoever did this... they wanted it seen.""

---

Clara ""CJ"" Jameson stepped off the train at Lake Charles station just after noon, squinting against the harsh sunlight. Sweat immediately beaded on her forehead, and she silently cursed the three petticoats her editor had insisted were necessary for a ""lady journalist."" Her camera case weighed heavy in her right hand, her notebook and pencils tucked safely in the leather satchel slung across her body.

At thirty-two, Clara had spent the last five years fighting for assignments that male reporters took for granted. ""No one wants to read about murder written by a woman,"" Editor Hayes had told her when she'd first requested to cover the crime beat. He'd relented only after the Tribune's regular crime man broke his leg falling down a flight of stairs‚Äîdrunk, as usual.

Clara had proven herself that very night, arriving at a waterfront shooting before the body was cold. Her photographs and unflinching prose had doubled the paper's circulation for the day. Hayes had never admitted she was good, but he kept assigning her the gruesome stories, especially when photographs were needed.

The telegram from Lake Charles had arrived yesterday: FAMILY FOUR MURDERED STOP AXE WEAPON STOP NEED PHOTOGRAPHER STOP"". Hayes had been reluctant to send her alone into the countryside, but the promise of exclusive photographs had won out over his concerns for her ""delicate female constitution.""

The platform bustled with travelers, porters calling out destinations as they loaded luggage onto carts. Clara scanned the crowd, looking for her contact. Sheriff Mouton had telegraphed that someone would meet her.

""Miss Jameson?"" A young man in an ill-fitting deputy's uniform approached, hat in hand. ""I'm Deputy Thibodeaux. Sheriff sent me to fetch you."" His eyes flicked to her camera case, then away. ""It's... it's a bad business, ma'am.""

Clara nodded briskly. ""I understand, Deputy. I've covered worse."" A lie, perhaps, but confidence was currency in her line of work. ""Do you have a buggy waiting?""

Twenty minutes later, they approached the Dupuis property. The house sat back from the road, a tidy white structure with green shutters and a wraparound porch. It looked peaceful, ordinary. Only the cluster of horses and the knot of men on the front lawn suggested anything amiss.

As they pulled up, Clara noted the faces turning toward her‚Äîsome curious, others openly hostile. A woman with a camera was still a novelty, especially here in the rural parishes. And a woman documenting murder? Scandalous.

Sheriff Mouton stepped forward as Warren helped Clara down from the buggy. He was a barrel-chested man with a salt-and-pepper mustache and deep-set eyes that had seen too much.

""Miss Jameson,"" he said, not offering his hand. ""I've kept the bodies as they were. Doc's been through, of course, but otherwise..."" He trailed off, glancing back at the house.

""Thank you, Sheriff,"" Clara replied, her voice steady. ""I'll need good light for the photographs.""

The sheriff nodded to Warren. ""Deputy'll help you with your equipment.""

Clara handed her tripod to Warren and followed the sheriff up the porch steps. The front door stood open, the interior dim after the bright sunlight outside. Several men stood in the front room, speaking in hushed tones‚Äîthe doctor, judging by his black bag, and a few others Clara guessed were local officials.

""Gentlemen,"" Sheriff Mouton announced, ""this is the journalist from New Orleans. She's here to document the scene."" He turned to Clara. ""You've got one hour, Miss Jameson. I want these poor souls at the undertaker's before sundown.""

The men filtered out, leaving Clara alone with Deputy Thibodeaux, who hovered uncertainly in the doorway with her equipment.

""You can set up the tripod here,"" Clara instructed, indicating the center of the front room. ""Then I'll need you to hold the flash powder when I'm ready.""

Warren nodded, his face pale beneath his tan. ""Yes, ma'am.""

Clara took a moment to center herself, drawing a deep breath that she immediately regretted. The smell was awful‚Äîblood and bodily fluids and the beginnings of decay in the summer heat. She'd covered murders before, but usually after the bodies had been removed. This was different.

""I'd like to see the scene first, before I start with the camera,"" she said.

Warren nodded, swallowing hard. ""Main bedroom's through there. Children's room is down the hall to the left.""

""Children?"" Clara's voice caught. The telegram hadn't mentioned children.

""Two of 'em. Little girl and boy.""

Clara closed her eyes briefly. Focus on the job. She opened her notebook, pencil poised. ""Tell me what you found, exactly as you saw it.""

Warren recounted his discovery while Clara took notes. When he finished, she set her notebook aside and picked up her camera case.

""Let's start with the main bedroom.""

The bedroom was dim, the heavy curtains drawn against the day's heat. Clara instructed Warren to pull them back, allowing sunlight to flood the room. The smell intensified in the warmth.

The bodies lay on the bed much as Warren had described. Despite her years of reporting, Clara felt her stomach twist. Jules Dupuis's face was a ruin, his wife's body clearly mutilated beneath the covers. Yet there was something eerily peaceful about their arrangement‚Äîhands placed just so, covers drawn up neatly.

Clara set up her camera, focusing the lens with practiced movements. ""The flash powder, please, Deputy.""

Warren held the flash pan steady as Clara ducked under the black cloth to compose her shot. Through the viewfinder, the scene became somehow less real‚Äîa tableau to document, not humans she'd never met in life.

""Ready,"" she said, positioning her finger over the shutter release. ""On three. One, two, three.""

The flash powder ignited with a harsh white glare and a puff of acrid smoke. Clara captured the scene from several angles, including close shots of Jules' shattered skull and the blood-soaked pillows.

""I need to pull back the covers,"" she said, glancing at Warren. ""For documentation.""

Warren looked away. ""Do what you need to, ma'am.""

Clara gently folded the quilt back, revealing Marie Dupuis's nightgown, nearly black with dried blood. Her torso had been repeatedly struck, the fabric torn where the weapon had cut through to the flesh beneath. Her legs were splayed at unnatural angles, clearly broken.

""Jesus,"" Clara whispered, quickly capturing the image before replacing the covers. She'd seen enough.

They moved to the children's room next. Clara steeled herself, but the sight of the small bodies hit her harder than she expected. Unlike their parents, the children's faces had not been spared. Little Anne's blonde curls were matted with gore, her brother's face cleaved nearly in two.

Clara worked mechanically, documenting the scene while fighting back bile. Warren stepped outside twice, returning ashen-faced but determined to help.

When she finished with the bedrooms, Clara turned her attention to the rest of the house. In the kitchen, she found a bloody handprint on the pump handle. Outside the back door, a distinct footprint in the mud‚Äîa man's boot, large.

""Has anyone else photographed this?"" she asked Warren, who shook his head.

""Sheriff's got a fellow coming from Baton Rouge tomorrow, but you're the first.""

Clara nodded, capturing the footprint from several angles.

Her final discovery came as she examined the woodpile behind the house. Half-buried in the kindling was an axe, its blade and handle caked with dried blood and what looked like bits of hair.

""Deputy,"" she called, keeping her voice level. ""I believe I've found the murder weapon.""

Warren hurried over, eyes widening. ""Good God. Must've ditched it on his way out.""

Clara shook her head. ""No. Look how it's placed‚Äîit was hidden deliberately, but not well. As if whoever left it wanted it to be found eventually."" She positioned her camera. ""Don't touch it until I've finished.""

The axe told its own story through her lens‚Äîa common tool turned to monstrous purpose, casually discarded after its work was done.

When Clara finally packed away her equipment, the sun was low in the sky. The sheriff and his men had kept their distance, allowing her to work uninterrupted. Now they gathered on the front lawn again, their faces grim as the undertaker's wagon arrived.

Clara watched as the men prepared to remove the bodies. The undertaker, a stooped man with thin white hair, directed his assistants with hushed commands. The first stretcher disappeared into the house, and Clara turned away. She'd seen enough death for one day.

Instead, she studied the crowd that had gathered at the edge of the property‚Äîneighbors, most likely, drawn by the news. They stood in small clusters, women clutching handkerchiefs to their mouths, men with hats in hand. Fear and curiosity warred on their faces.

A girl no older than twelve broke away from the group, running toward the house before her mother caught her arm. ""But I want to see Annie!"" the child wailed. ""She promised to show me her new doll!""

Clara's throat tightened. The human cost of these murders would ripple outward for years‚Äîfriends left behind, promises never kept.

Clara approached Sheriff Mouton, her notebook open. ""I'd like to ask a few questions before I head back to file my story.""

The sheriff sighed, gesturing toward the porch steps where they could sit. ""What do you want to know?""

""Any suspects? Anyone with a grudge against the family?""

""Jules Dupuis was well-liked. Worked hard, paid his debts, kept to himself mostly."" The sheriff frowned. ""Though there was some talk about property lines with his neighbor Howard Benoit last spring. Nothing serious.""

Clara made notes. ""Any unusual visitors lately? Strangers in town?""

""Train brings folks through all the time. Nobody particular stands out."" He glanced at her. ""We did have a revival preacher set up a tent out by the crossroads last week. Not our usual kind‚Äîlots of shouting and falling down. Dupuis was Catholic, though. Wouldn't have gone to that.""

""What about valuables? Was anything taken?""

""Marie's jewelry box was untouched. Jules kept cash in a coffee tin in the kitchen‚Äîstill there, about thirty dollars."" The sheriff shook his head. ""Wasn't robbery, that's for damn sure.""

""When was the family last seen alive?""

""Jules sold some eggs and butter at Tanner's store yesterday afternoon. Marie and the children were at church Sunday morning, according to Father Duval."" Mouton squinted up at the sun. ""Doc puts the time of death around midnight, based on the bodies' condition.""

A fly buzzed past Clara's ear, and she fought the urge to swat at it. More would come soon, drawn by what lay inside. Nature didn't respect human tragedy.

Clara studied her notes. ""The bodies were arranged after death. Almost... posed.""

Sheriff Mouton nodded grimly. ""Like they was being laid out proper for a funeral, 'cept it was done by the same hands that killed 'em."" He spat into the dirt. ""Sick bastard.""

""Have you seen anything like this before?""

The sheriff was quiet for a long moment. ""Not in my jurisdiction, thank the Lord."" 

Clara nodded, her pencil hovering over the page. ""One last thing‚ÄîI found what appears to be the murder weapon in the woodpile out back. An axe.""

Sheriff Mouton stood. ""Show me.""

After directing the sheriff to the axe, Clara gathered her belongings. The undertaker and his assistant were already carrying the first body out, wrapped in a sheet. Clara paused, watching as they loaded Jules Dupuis into the wagon. Such a small container for a life ended.

""Miss Jameson."" Warren approached, hat in hand. ""Sheriff says I'm to drive you back to the station. Last train to New Orleans leaves at seven.""

Clara nodded, suddenly exhausted. ""Thank you, Deputy.""

As they drove away, Clara looked back at the house, now cast in the golden light of sunset. From a distance, it still looked like any other home‚Äîwhite paint glowing in the fading light, green shutters drawn against the evening heat. No hint of the horror within.

""Will your story run tomorrow?"" Warren asked as they neared town.

""Day after, most likely. I need to develop the photographs tonight."" She paused, studying the young deputy's profile. ""Have you been with the sheriff's department long?""

Warren kept his eyes on the road. ""Going on three years. Never seen nothing like this, though.""

""No one ever has, until they do,"" Clara replied softly. She'd started in society pages‚Äîdebutante balls and charity luncheons‚Äîbefore talking her editor into letting her cover the morgue beat. That first dead body had haunted her for weeks. Now she'd lost count.

They passed a group of men gathered outside the general store, their conversation dying as the buggy rolled by. Eyes followed them, curious and suspicious.

""Word travels fast,"" Clara observed.

Warren nodded grimly. ""By sundown, half the parish will have their doors barred and shotguns loaded."" He glanced at her. ""Your story‚Äîwill it mention how they were... arranged?""

""It's significant. The killer took time, posed them deliberately. That tells us something.""

""What's it tell us?""

Clara considered. ""That it wasn't just rage. There was purpose to it, twisted as it might be."" 

""Purpose?"" Warren shook his head. ""What purpose could there be in butchering children?""

Clara had no answer. In her satchel, her notebook contained the beginning of what would become tomorrow's front-page story. She'd write of the savagery, the mystery, the fear now spreading through Lake Charles. She'd describe the broken bodies and the blood-soaked beds.

But she wouldn't‚Äîcouldn't‚Äîcapture the stillness of that house, the buzzing of flies around cooling blood, the way little Thomas Dupuis's toy soldier still stood guard on his bedside table, watching over a child who would never play again.

The station was quiet when they arrived, just a porter sweeping the platform and an elderly couple waiting with matched leather valises. Clara checked her pocket watch‚Äîforty minutes until departure.

""I should develop these plates before I leave,"" she said. ""Is there somewhere dark I could work? A storage room, perhaps?""

Warren thought for a moment. ""Station master's office has a supply closet. No windows. I can ask him.""

After securing permission, Clara set up her portable developing kit in the cramped closet. The chemical smell of the developer solution filled the small space as she worked by the light of a single red-filtered lamp. The images emerged slowly on the glass plates‚ÄîJules Dupuis's shattered skull, Marie's blood-soaked nightgown, the children's small bodies arranged in mock sleep.

Working in the darkness, Clara was grateful for the red lamp that revealed only shapes and shadows, not the full horror of what she'd captured. Tomorrow, in her New Orleans darkroom, she'd see it all again in cruel detail. For now, the merciful dimness let her focus on the technical aspects‚Äîexposure times, chemical baths, drying racks.

She wrapped the developed plates carefully in cloth and packed them into her case. Outside, the train whistle sounded its arrival.

Warren was waiting on the platform, hat in hand. ""Got what you needed?""

Clara nodded, not trusting herself to speak. The day's horrors pressed against her composure like floodwaters against a levee.

""Well, safe travels back to New Orleans, Miss Jameson."" He hesitated. ""Will you be coming back? For the funeral, I mean?""

""Perhaps. Depends on how the story develops."" She offered her hand, which he shook awkwardly. ""Thank you for your help today, Deputy.""

""Just doing my job, ma'am."" He glanced at her camera case. ""Those pictures... they gonna show everything?""

""That's what my editor wants. The whole truth.""

Warren nodded slowly. ""Sometimes the truth is ugly.""

""Doesn't make it any less true.""

As the train pulled away from Lake Charles station that evening, Clara stared out the window at the darkening landscape. In her camera case, the glass plates held images that would shock New Orleans breakfast tables in two days' time. Her story would sell papers, just as her editor wanted.

She pulled out her notebook, flipping past her interview notes to a blank page. By lamplight, she began to sketch the scene as she remembered it‚Äînot just the physical details she'd photographed, but the feeling of the place. The weight of silence in a house that should have been filled with a family's morning routines. The unnatural stillness.

*Jules Dupuis (38) - Skull crushed, multiple blows. Face unrecognizable.*
*Marie Dupuis (36) - Torso mutilated, legs broken. Face intact.*
*Anne Dupuis (7) - Facial wounds.*
*Thomas Dupuis (4) - Face nearly severed, body intact.*
*All posed as if sleeping. Hands arranged. No sign of struggle in house.*
*Weapon: Axe found in woodpile, deliberately placed to be discovered.*

Clara underlined the last point twice. The killer wanted the weapon found. Wanted his work seen and understood. This wasn't just murder‚Äîit was a message.

She closed her notebook and gazed out at the passing countryside, now shrouded in twilight. Farmhouses glowed in the distance, lanterns lit against the encroaching dark. In those homes, families would be sitting down to supper, children chattering about their day. Just as the Dupuis family might have done last night, never suspecting what awaited them in the dark hours before dawn.

From her years covering crime, Clara knew most murders were messy, impulsive affairs‚Äîdrunken arguments turned deadly, robberies gone wrong, jealous rage unleashed. This was different. The careful positioning of the bodies, the deliberate placement of the weapon... whoever had done this had taken their time. Felt no fear of discovery.

The train rocked gently as it picked up speed, heading south toward New Orleans. The rhythmic clacking of wheels on tracks became a lullaby, but Clara fought against fatigue. The images from today would follow her into her dreams; she knew that well enough.

A colored porter moved through the car, lighting the lamps as dusk deepened outside. ""Evening, ma'am,"" he said, tipping his cap. ""Dinner will be served in the dining car shortly.""

Clara nodded, forcing a smile. ""Thank you.""

As he moved on, Clara found herself studying his hands‚Äîstrong, capable hands that carried luggage and served meals. Not unlike the hands that had wielded the axe. The killer could be anyone‚Äîa farmer, a shopkeeper, a railroad man. Someone who had passed unnoticed through Lake Charles, leaving horror in his wake.

But as the rhythmic clacking of the train lulled her toward an uneasy sleep, Clara couldn't shake the feeling that the Dupuis family murders were just the beginning of something larger. Something worse.

In the distance, thunder rumbled‚Äîor perhaps it was just the train's wheels on the tracks, carrying her back to the city and away from the quiet house where four bodies lay cooling in the Louisiana night.",0,1746810728.0,scarystories,0,0.5,False

1kinpju,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1kinpju/why_choose_the_nespresso_en124s_pixie_espresso/,Why Choose the Nespresso EN124S Pixie Espresso Machine A Detailed Review,"A smooth, creamy cup of espresso, brewed effortlessly in under a minute‚Äîthis is the experience I‚Äôve consistently had with the **Nespresso EN124S Pixie Espresso Machine**. As someone who is almost religious about their morning coffee ritual, I tested this espresso machine extensively over several weeks to see if it might earn a permanent spot on my counter. The short answer? It‚Äôs been impressive thus far, but it‚Äôs not perfect.

**Compact and Stylish Appeal**
With its compact dimensions (4.37""D x 12.83""W x 9.25""H), this machine has found a snug home in my small kitchen without dominating the counter space. Designed in sleek aluminum, the aesthetic is modern but minimal, fitting well with most kitchen d√©cor. Its portability has also proved convenient; at just 3.6kg, I even moved it to my office desk for one particularly demanding week of deadlines. The construction feels durable; the aluminum isn‚Äôt just attractive‚Äîit seems like it‚Äôll hold up for years.

**Ease of Use and Functional Features**
As advertised, this is a fully automatic espresso machine that requires minimal effort on my part. Using it couldn‚Äôt be simpler: pop in a capsule, select either the Espresso or Lungo button, and within 25 seconds, your coffee is ready! I also appreciate that these buttons can be reprogrammed to suit personal preferences. The backlit buttons make operation straightforward even in my dimly lit pre-dawn kitchen.

In terms of its high-pressure pump, the 19-bar system does make a noticeable difference compared to lower-pressure machines I‚Äôve tried before. The coffee consistently comes out with a velvety crema‚Äîa hallmark of a well-made espresso. I‚Äôve also reaped the benefits of the reusable filter type; it adds an eco-friendly touch that aligns with my attempts to reduce waste.

**Highlights**
- Ultra-compact size ideal for limited counter space.
- 19-bar pressure pump for exceptional coffee extraction.
- One-touch controls for quick and easy operation.
- Energy-saving auto shut-off feature after 9 minutes of inactivity.

**Performance and Taste**
How does the coffee taste? Quite excellent, if I‚Äôm honest. The machine manages to extract the full depth of flavor from the capsules. I‚Äôve sampled Nespresso original pods as well as compatible third-party capsules, and both worked equally well. The fast heat-up system reduces waiting time to 25 seconds, which is a genuine perk when mornings are hectic. Also, the included milk frother has been a game-changer for my cappuccino cravings. With skim milk, I‚Äôve managed to create the kind of frothy masterpiece that resembles caf√©-made drinks.

However, I noticed a slight tendency for post-brewing drips. While the drip tray does its job catching them, it‚Äôs an element worth pointing out. It‚Äôs a tiny issue, but I‚Äôve developed the habit of emptying the tray more frequently than I‚Äôm used to.

**Negatives**
- Occasional leaking from the water container, though not excessively.
- Slightly noisier compared to similar models.

**Competitive Options on the Market**
When comparing it to competitors, this espresso machine stands out for its compact size and premium features. Compared to my Keurig, the Pixie delivers coffee with far more depth and that rich crema I adore. On the other hand, machines like the Breville Bambino Plus offer fresher espresso by grinding beans on demand, but they take up significantly more counter space and require additional effort to clean.

The Pixie also stacks up favorably against its larger sibling, the Nespresso Vertuo Plus. While the Pixie only works with standard-size Nespresso pods, the Vertuo Plus accommodates both espresso and larger coffee sizes, which may be a deciding factor for those with diverse caffeine needs. But where the Pixie wins is in its simplicity and focus‚Äîit‚Äôs built around espresso enthusiasts like myself who prefer quick yet high-quality brews.

**True Value**
In terms of price-to-quality ratio, I‚Äôd argue this machine delivers solid value. It‚Äôs on the higher end for single-serve espresso makers, but the advanced features and consistently excellent coffee justify the purchase. The inclusion of 14 complimentary capsules gives new users a chance to explore coffee varieties, which was a nice bonus for me. If getting a reliable, caf√©-like experience at home is a priority, this espresso machine might just be worth the splurge.

Ill grow up and become a regular office worker. I am no one special. Maybe my teachers say im smart or smth but in the future no one will care what i was.

In the mornings ill wake up. make a cup of coffee. rush to catch the bus. Its peak hours so it very crowded. Ill check my email to check for any work related stuff. Since i had not eaten ill probably grab a sandwich from the convenience store.

Ello ello, I'm Lewis, 30M and from the UK.

I'll try and keep it short and sweet. Unlike me, I'm your typical tall skinny white guy.

I'm on the search for a new bestie to join me on this journey called life. Someone to share the day with, build a connection, have some fun, live love laugh toaster bath. I'm interested in investing in something long term with someone who we can be out silly selves.

I've come out of a long term relationship a while back and kind of missing that close connection with someone. I'm not looking for anything romantic, but I am looking for someone who wants a deeply connected friendship.

This isn't for everyone but ideally I'm looking for someone kind of clingy. Someone who wants to talk all day, checks their phone for messages from each other, doesn't care about stuff like double messaging or spamming the f*ck out of each other. Someone to get excited to check your phone for.


I'm like an onion. Peel back the layers to find out what's underneath. Try not to cry while you do it. I like my humour how I like my coffee, dark. I will probably p*ss you off.

Some stuff about me so you know I'm not a blank slate ready to get smashed to death by the hammer of life:

- Recently started the gym. About time I started taking better care of myself. I need someone to hold me accountable!
- When I leave the house I like to cycle, hike explore and occasionally socialise with the unlucky sods I call friends.
- Heavy metal fan - You'll sometimes find me ar a concert/gig with the above mentioned friends. Bloodstock 2025!
- I play games. Currently playing POE2 but was obsessed with Satisfsctory the past two months. You'll usually find me AFKing on OSRS.
- I've been creating an android game for the past year or so in my spare time. Programming is hard at times but very rewarding. 
- I also have a 5 year old daughter with my ex. Would be great to connect with other parents.

What I'm looking for in you:
- Age 21-40 - Not opposed to people outside this range but Ideally I'm looking for people around my age
- We don't need 100% compatibility on hobbies/likes, just show interest.
- Timezones don't matter. I work a crazy schedule
- Wanting to be supportive of each other and push each other
- Can hold a conversation and willing to put the effort in.
- Silly/chaotic vibes preferred

With an active infant and an ever-busy schedule, I rely on tools that simplify my life without compromising safety or convenience. This carrier has been a consistent companion, transforming how I manage outings with my little one. Of course, like any product, it has its strong suits and areas that could use refinement.

**Smart and Lightweight Design**  
Its lightweight construction is one of the first things to catch my attention. At just 14.2 pounds, it‚Äôs super easy to maneuver and carry, even after a long day. The black finish adds a touch of modern sophistication, while the polyester and metal combination makes it feel both sturdy and durable. Folding it up single-handedly was surprisingly smooth‚ÄîI‚Äôve done it while juggling groceries and a diaper bag at the same time. The foldable size (7.52 x 31.26 x 17.78 inches) allows me to store it in the car trunk or our tiny hallway closet without taking up valuable space. Importantly, its compact nature makes it perfect for urban dwellers cramped by limited storage.

**Universal Compatibility for Infant Car Seats**  
Compatibility can make or break a product like this, and thankfully, this one doesn't disappoint. The Baby Trend SG13105 Snap-N-Go EX is engineered to accept various infant car seats from Baby Trend and other major brands. I appreciate not having to buy a new car seat carrier for every change in accessories. It fit perfectly with my existing infant car seat, leaving me less stressed‚Äîand no scrambling to buy matching accessories. 

  
[Check Baby Trend SG13105 Snap-N-Go EX price on Amazon.](https://babycareshop.com/p/b00838bnk2/)  


**Convenient Storage Options for Parents**  
Let‚Äôs talk storage, shall we? The parent tray with its dual cup holders is honestly a lifesaver on chaotic mornings. Whether it's holding my iced coffee or a baby bottle, everything feels organized and at arm‚Äôs length. The covered compartment on the tray is another thoughtful addition. It‚Äôs an ideal stash spot for my keys, phone, or the random tiny toys my little one insists we bring on walks. And don‚Äôt even get me started on how the extra-large drop-down storage basket underneath managed to carry all our baby essentials during an impromptu park outing. Seriously, I even tucked a picnic blanket in there with room to spare!

**Positives**  
- Lightweight and easy to carry  
- Universal compatibility with most infant car seats  
- Compact, one-hand fold for practical storage  
- Spacious storage basket and parent-friendly tray

**Safety and Braking System**  
Safety always looms as a priority for me when selecting baby gear. The car seat securing strap works seamlessly in tandem with the adjustable straps on the carriage frame. Both features keep the infant car seat snugly in place, eliminating my ""paranoia-parent moments."" Moreover, rear-wheel brakes operated by foot promise that the stroller stays exactly where you leave it. Whether on a slanted driveway or a windy patio caf√©, I trust its stability.

**Good Points**  
- Adjustable safety straps ensure a great fit for various car seats  
- Rear wheel brakes bolster security during pauses  
- High weight capacity of 45 pounds  

**Drawbacks**  
Of course, not every element of your dream product comes true. Folding, while generally smooth, has occasionally needed an extra nudge midway. One minor grievance is the plastic wheels. Although functional, they don‚Äôt handle uneven terrain as gracefully as other strollers I've tested. A more robust set of wheels would definitely expand its usage range for outdoor strolls through trails or uneven city sidewalks.

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Wheels perform poorly on rugged paths  
- Occasional snag mid-fold process  

**Challengers**  
Comparing this stroller to direct competitors such as the Chicco KeyFit Caddy Stroller Frame or the Graco SnugRider Elite, I feel the Baby Trend SG13105 Snap-N-Go EX holds its own in terms of lightweight design and compatibility. However, Chicco‚Äôs offering edges ahead with slightly smoother wheel motion and better shock absorption, particularly on gravel or uneven terrain. In contrast, Graco stands out with its additional padded handlebar, catering to parents who prefer extra comfort for longer outings. Still, the Snap-N-Go EX excels with its massive storage basket, an area where both alternatives tend to fall short.

**True Value**  
For its asking price, this product delivers dependable utility, clean aesthetics, and a trove of features that simplify outings with an infant. While alternatives in the market might provide minor advantages in specific aspects like wheel material or handle comfort, the affordability and thoughtful design of this carrier struck me as a well-balanced choice. In my experience, it‚Äôs a smart investment for city dwellers or parents with compact storage needs.

Please‚Äîyou‚Äôre okay.
This isn‚Äôt you. Your thoughts aren‚Äôt you.
Happy place. Happy place.
Bagels. Sweet potatoes. Garden.‚Äù



‚ÄúThis dirty, useless waste of space. What a failure. He has everything handed to him and he still messes it up. Mom should‚Äôve shoved him back up. He makes me sick. Less than human garbage. I should just‚Äî‚Äú

‚ÄúNo.
What am I thinking?‚Äù

‚ÄúI know I fucked up, Daniel,‚Äù Angel said breaking me free from thought. He was scratching at his arm like he wanted to peel himself open. ‚ÄúIt won‚Äôt happen again. I just‚Ä¶ I really needed it this time. You don‚Äôt understand how hard it is.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt respond. I wasn‚Äôt listening. I‚Äôd heard it all before.

This wasn‚Äôt the first relapse. It wouldn‚Äôt be the last. Everyone‚Äîespecially me‚Äîwas exhausted by his apologies.

‚ÄúYou need to go before Cindy gets home from school. I don‚Äôt want her seeing you like this. Go to Unc‚Äôs.‚Äù
I shut the door before he could say another word.

I stood there, still. Processing. I could feel him standing on the other side of the door, too, like his shadow had seeped through the wood. Waiting. Hoping.

Eventually, he left. I felt it like a chill lifting.

I‚Äôve always had these thoughts. Sudden, violent things that crash into my brain like a car through glass. Things no normal person should think. Hate that doesn‚Äôt feel like it belongs to me‚Ä¶

Sometimes I wonder if they come from somewhere else. Either way they‚Äôre never pleasant, and it‚Äôs very draining. 

I went back to sit down amid the mess in the living room.  I looked at all the papers scattered about and the broken glass from my new wine cups laying near my coffee table. Red stains covering my new carpet. 

‚ÄúGreat. more work. I‚Äôll have to get this cleaned up quick.‚Äù I thought to myself. 

Cindy would be home in less than an hour. Ever since her mom left us I‚Äôve tried my very best to give her a normal life, something I never had. And it gets increasingly harder when things like this happen. 

An hour later Cindy got home, she walked in cheerfully. ‚ÄúHey dad‚Äù she quipped as she threw her bag on the couch and slouched down. ‚Äú hey sweetie, how was your day‚Äù I asked trying to seem normal. 

‚ÄúIt was okay, but like soooo boring. I can‚Äôt stand this new teacher. He‚Äôs like a goof fr.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWhat new teacher?‚Äù I inquired

‚ÄúMr Johnson, he‚Äôs replacing Ms Steven‚Äôs our math teacher.‚Äù She said

‚ÄúWhat happened to her? ‚Äú

‚ÄúIdk, quit probably. She was really going through it with the divorce and all‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs rough baby‚Äîwhat do you want for dinner? ‚Äú I asked straying the conversation away from soemthing heavy. 

‚ÄúChicken Alfredooooooo‚Äù she sang out with a grin. 

‚ÄúOf course baby‚Äù  
I walked into the kitchen and started cooking. We had a peaceful dinner and went to bed without a hitch. 

The next morning before I could get ready for work I got a call from my uncle. 

‚ÄúDaniel you need to get over here right now.‚Äù 
‚ÄúWhat happe-‚Äú

‚ÄúNOW. You need to come NOW‚Äù his voice cracked like something inside him had already broken.

He hung up and I rushed to my car to drive over since he only lived 3 minutes away. I didn‚Äôt know what to expect, but not this. definitely not this. 

Uncle Joe‚Äôs front door was cracked open when I arrived. 

I pushed it wide and stepped into chaos. Furniture overturned, a lamp shattered on the floor. Glass smothering the middle of the living room. There was blood‚Äîjust a little‚Äîon the tile. A thin red smear on the wall. 

‚ÄúJoe?‚Äù I called out.

A grunt answered from the back room.

I found him slumped in his recliner, pale, holding a dish towel to his side. Blood soaked through it.

‚ÄúWhat the hell happened?‚Äù I rushed to him.

‚ÄúYour damn brother,‚Äù he wheezed, half-laughing, half-wincing. ‚ÄúCame in screaming, tore up the place. I tried to calm him down. He shoved me. I lost my balance and fell into the glass table.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhere is he?‚Äù My fists clenched before I could stop them.

Joe motioned toward the garage. ‚ÄúOut there. Said he needed air. Or to scream. One of the two.‚Äù

I made it halfway across the living room when I heard the garage door creak open.

Angel stepped in, shirtless, breathing hard, sweat glistening off his face. His pupils were blown wide.

‚ÄúDanny,‚Äù he smiled. ‚ÄúMan, I didn‚Äôt think you‚Äôd come.‚Äù He said as if he were greeting me at a bar. 

‚ÄúYou hurt Joe.‚Äù I shouted

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs fine,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs tougher than he looks. You‚Äôre mad, I get it. But this‚Äîthis ain‚Äôt all my fault.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou always say that.‚Äù My eyes beaming through him. 

He paced a bit, ran a hand through his hair. ‚ÄúYou know what‚Äôs crazy? I came here trying to get clean again. I thought maybe I could fix things. But then he started preaching at me. Talking about Cindy  and Jeffie like they‚Äôre some sort of angels. She‚Äôs not. He‚Äôs not. None of us are.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you dare bring up my daughter.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI was just saying,‚Äù Angel shrugged. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs gonna find out what the world‚Äôs really like someday. I mean, you did. Remember what dad used to do when you cried? You remember, right?‚Äù

My stomach dropped.

Angel stepped closer. ‚ÄúI always figured you buried it. But I didn‚Äôt. I remembered everything. I just‚Ä¶ handled it differently.‚Äù His breath stank of liquor and sin. 

I stared at him. ‚ÄúWhat are you talking about?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat neighbor‚Äôs kid when I was thirteen‚ÄîPeter?‚Äù His voice was calm now, but slightly slurred. ‚ÄúI did to him what dad did to me. Only once. I swear. But‚Ä¶ it felt like balance. You know? Like I got to put it somewhere. Like it wasn‚Äôt just us anymore.‚Äù 

The room turned to static.

‚ÄúI always thought maybe you‚Äôd get it one day. That you‚Äôd break, like me. Then maybe we‚Äôd finally be brothers again.‚Äù He said unnervingly 

I took a step forward. He didn‚Äôt move.

‚ÄúI should‚Äôve left you in that bathroom years ago,‚Äù I said through gritted teeth.

Then from behind us: a cough, a weak gasp.

We turned. Uncle Joe was leaning forward in the recliner, clutching his chest, eyes wide in panic.

‚ÄúJoe?‚Äù I rushed over, dropped to my knees. ‚ÄúUnc? Hey. Look at me.‚Äù

He opened his mouth but no sound came out. His lips were blue.

Angel stood behind me, frozen. ‚ÄúHe was just talking ten minutes ago‚Ä¶‚Äù he croaked softly

I felt for a pulse. Nothing.

‚ÄúCall 911!‚Äù I snapped.

But I already knew. His skin was cooling. His eyes were glassy.

He was gone.

And the moment my brain accepted it, the voice came back.
Clearer this time. Not like a thought.

More like‚Ä¶ a soft whisper in my ear.

‚ÄúI knew it , I knew it , I knew it. I should just get rid of him. Good for nothing trash. You deserve to suffer. You deserve what dad did to you.  Everywhere you go you ruin everything. You‚Äôre poison. Unclean filth. I can‚Äôt stand you. I hate you. I hate you so much. You remind me of dad. You deserve what I‚Äôm going‚Äî‚Äú

‚ÄúDo you want to follow the ambulance to the hospital sir? ‚Äú  an Officer asked me as I stood by in a trance watching EMT load my uncle‚Äôs body bag. 

‚ÄúI..uh yes.‚Äù I replied 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry about your loss son. You could probably use these.‚Äù The officer said warmly as he handed me a pamphlet full of resources to help with the passing of a loved one. 

‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù I said emptily. Crumpling the pamphlet. 


The next few days were chaotic and melancholic all the same. Angel ran before the cops came, but they caught him the next day. They brought him in for questioning and then let him go from inconclusive evidence. Go figure, this is what passes as justice these days. I had to take over the arrangements for the funeral and informing the rest of the family about it. The funeral came and went as if it was just another day for everyone. I tried to stay grounded as my thoughts were running a thousand miles a minute. Cindy was what kept me from going insane. Her cute reassuring smile could disarm a crazed gunman. 

A week went by before I saw Angel again. By that time I sent Cindy to stay with her cousins for a while to get her mind off things. And I had already filed a restraining order against Angel. 

He looked at me with eyes that hadn‚Äôt seen sleep as he littered my doorway. ‚ÄúCan you buy me a -‚Äú
I shut the door in his face. I wasn‚Äôt in the mood for his bs. I felt his shadow lingering for over an hour after that. Even when I went back out to make sure he was gone. I still felt like he was here. After the second time I looked around I let that feeling dissolve and went on about my day. 

My therapist suggested I try meditation to help deal with the stress. I laid out a mat and sat down and started to meditate. I figured I‚Äôd try counting first to keep a steady focus.

What is th‚Äî

A long drawn out scratch at my living room window interrupted me. 
I wiped my eye as I glanced at it. Then I noticed my hand. Black liquid. All over my face.

 ‚ÄúWhat the hell?‚Äù 

I rushed to my bathroom and Washed it all off. It looked like a bit of it got into my right eye, I might have to go to the doctor. I leaned down to rinse my eye. When I got back up, I froze.

My reflection was grinning‚ÄîI wasn‚Äôt . 
I checked my face with my hand. I definitely wasn‚Äôt. And my reflection hadn‚Äôt moved an inch. 

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong Danny ? ‚Äú
My reflection whispered, its eyes grew completely black and void. 

I just stared. Unable to move. Unable to speak and my lungs screaming. 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time Danny, you‚Äôve waited too long
We‚Äôve waited too long.
Do it. 
Do it Danny . ‚Äú

he raised a long jagged blade and his grin grew more wicked. 

Thud. 

I opened my eyes. I was still in the living room. I got up quickly. I dropped the knife in my hand. 

Thud. Thud. Thud. 

I went to the door. Angel, once again. 
Before the door was fully open he began. ‚Äú hey man I really need help this time. I‚Äôll go clean I promise.‚Äù Words I‚Äôve heard one too many times before. 

‚ÄúDo it Danny.
Do it 
    Do
  It‚Äù

‚ÄúPlease Daniel, I promise for real this time.‚Äù Angel pleaded to deaf ears. 


‚ÄúLiar ‚Äú
‚ÄúDancing with me‚Äù

So lost in thought I tuned Angel out. 
I smiled and said ‚Äúalright man come on in.‚Äù 

Angel walked in. My grin widened. 

‚ÄúHe deserves it. You know. We know it. 
You‚Äôd be doing him a favor . He can‚Äôt live with himself. He‚Äôs weak. Too weak. ‚Äú

Not even 5 minutes went by and Angel was snoring on the couch. 
Passed out from whatever drugs he was on. 

‚ÄúLook at him. Pathetic. ‚Äú

‚ÄúHe‚Äôll never amount to anything. All he does is bring you trouble. Pain, and sorrow. That‚Äôs all he‚Äôs good for. ‚Äú

I gripped the handle tight. I felt it pulsing, like it had a heartbeat of its own. 

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a burden. A parasite . A roach‚Äù

My thoughts growing louder and louder in my head. Screaming. Begging to escape. 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs his fault Danny. It‚Äôs all his fault. 
His fault Danny 
All his fault.‚Äù

The thoughts weren‚Äôt just in my head anymore. They were all around me. Inside the walls. Echoing in the vents. 

‚ÄúAll his fault‚Äù
‚ÄúAll his fault‚Äù
‚ÄúALL MY FAULT DANNY‚Äù
Angel shrieked suddenly. Sitting bolt upright, his eyes as black as void. 

The knife was stuck too deep by the time I realized what I was doing. 

Angel started laughing. Wet and guttural. Like the sound came from his stomach. 
‚ÄúHehehehehe‚Ä¶.
Im so proud of you Danny.‚Äù
 
It wasn‚Äôt my brother‚Äôs voice anymore. Angel sounded like the voice in my head. The voice that‚Äôs haunted my thoughts and taken me to darkest corners of humanity. It was its voice. 


His mouth kept moving but the voice was booming from every direction. 

‚ÄúDanny ‚Äú
‚ÄúNow I‚Äôm free from you.. ‚Äú

I stumbled back, crashing onto the cold hard floor, breath ragged. I was shirtless. 

Angel stood. Grinding his teeth. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôll see you soon‚Äù

and then sprinted straight through a window with inhuman speed. 

Glass exploded outward‚Äîbut I didn‚Äôt hear it. 

Half a second later every mirror and window in the house shattered . They cracked like bones all at once. 

The whispers left my head that day, but the wind didn‚Äôt carry them far.

1kinhmv,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1kinhmv/aio_so_frustrated_airbnb_wont_help_me/,AIO- So frustrated... AirBnB won't help me!,"Hi All,

I posted this review for this listing:¬†[Ocean view of Punta del Este! Playa Mansa. Port. - Apartments for Rent in Punta del Este, Departamento de Maldonado, Uruguay - Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/1097112774740107334?source_impression_id=p3_1746807353_P3k_tUU_yNaxi11K)¬†\---¬†[Juliana Fotia](https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/563423739)

April 2025 Juliana is a wonderful person and she has a place in a perfect location! Her place has so much potential! The challenge is it needs quite a bit of maintenance and some updates to layout that can be difficult to manage as an older person. For example the bathroom had a shower with no stall (wet bathroom) or sinks that were so low they were designed for children. Two of the three bathrooms seem very fancy just very difficult to use as the sinks and toilet placements make getting through the door difficult or you constantly got wet from washing your hands. Some of the plumbing just needs some TLC. The kitchen cabinets are getting old so you need to be careful opening them. And the smell of gas from exhaust in the garage can be a bit overwhelming besides the fact they have a firepit grill in the house which also smells. The laundry machine was also broken but Juliana was kind enough to offer us free laundry service. I wish her all the best and I hope this review helps when booking.

Her Response on my profile!!!:¬†[Juliana Fotia](https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/563423739)¬†April 2025Horrible experiencia. No recomiendo!!! Exige reembolso sin justificaci√≥n. No lo volver√© a alojar jam√°s.

My response after that: Please review my review of her place. I always try to find the silver lining but in this case it was difficult. I wish Juliana the best and hope she can fix the problems for her guests in the future.

AirBnB won't post my review because it violates some sort of policy but they won't tell me what. On the other hand they won't take down her post even though I shared all the details of the mold, dirt, bathrooms with no shower stall, broken coffee machine and broken laundry machine. So I get a ding on my profile and she gets off scott free! So frustrated. I have all the pictures of the broken down place that I shared with AirBnB and this lady and they say no it is fine to have moldy hair and junk all over her house with broken things... Odd thing is I got out of the house immediately and AirBnB gave me a refund for the nights not stayed. So I guess its ok to give a refund for a place that is crap but to try and find a silver lining when posting a review for a shithole is not allowed. Guess we can't tell the truth in this world anymore. Even when coated with sugar but yes you will be penalized... you are always at fault.",2,1746809926.0,AmIOverreacting,0,0.75,False
1kingy5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kingy5,AIO - Was He Planning to Kill Me?,"I need to give a little context, because you are going to read this and think ""Wow. How could she be so fucking dumb?"" 

I was married to a man I met in highschool for 17 years. Meaning I had never dated beside him. In my early 30s, I divorced him and was on my own. Try not to judge me, but I went hard on the dating apps, not looking for anything serious. I was just speed dating like crazy. Maybe it was my new found freedom (it was a toxic abusive marriage). I had a lot of fun, but I definitely had to learn lessons the hard way. I didn't get to date in my 20s, so I really didn't know what I was doing. 

Okay, on to the night in question. I had a tinder date set up at a local bar/coffee shop. My date was late, so I sat at the bar and was chatting up the male bartender. He told me he was from a small town called Venice South of New Orleans and that it was kind of in the middle of nowhere. We hit it off and I enjoyed talking to him.

My date arrived and we sit down at a table and talk (I consumed no alcohol by the way at any time this night. I never drink during dates with people I don't know). Well, sadly, we didn't really vibe and it was pretty obvious. No problem. He was a nice enough guy. We made plans to walk around in the local park for a little bit longer anyway. I guess I figured maybe I'd at least make a new friend (some of the guys I dated that year turned into platonic friendships).

He gets up and goes to the bathroom. I know many are gonna judge me for this - but I gave my number to the bartender because we did vibe from our short talk and I figured I had nothing to lose. Slutty? Probably. I warned you I had no idea what I was doing at the time .

Me and the date walk around the park. It's getting dark now. We say goodnight and I go home.

Sometimes around maybe 1 am, I get a text from the bartender. We chat a bit and realize we are literally living like 15 minutes away from each other. He asks if I want to hang out that night, and I agree (I should also mention I have a history of being naive and impulsive). We didn't make concrete plans, but I agreed to meet him at a Best Buy parking lot and we would figure out where we were going. This was the beginning of my mistakes. I see now, I should have looked for a place open that late and met him there. 

We meet at the parking lot. He starts walking to his car, and I instincualy follow. We still hadn't made plans yet. I'm trying to remember what was in my mind that made me do it, but I don't know. I don't remember if we said we would figure it out while driving around. I think thats what was said. 

We start driving (I'm thinking we are driving randomly around while we chat). Suddenly the lights of the city get fewer and fewer. I don't know where we are or where we are going. I light heartedly ask him (I was getting a little nervous but wasn't sure if I was worrying over nothing). As the lights are now behind us on an empty road, he tells me we are going to his home town, Venice. He wants to show me a cool forte. I'm adventurous. The idea of exploring a fort sounded fun. 

As he's driving he tells me he is an avid runner. I think he said he is a professional. He's over 6 ft tall and thin. But this detail about him being a runner is relevant later. 

We get to the forte and obviously we are trespassing. We get to the parking lot. On the map of the fort I posted, the parking lot is around where the market is, maybe a bit close to where the name of the forte is in the top left of the forte. Another grave mistake - I leave my phone in the car (I should also mention here another mistake I never made again after this night - I didn't tell anyone where I was going or with who)

We get out of the car, and he's holding one of those heavy duty flashlights. Light big and bulky. Suddenly, there is a shift in me. Something clicks and I realize something isn't right. It dawns on me we are in the middle of nowhere in the middle of the night. I'm with a man I barely know. And he's carrying something that could easily become a weapon. 

I low key panick a little. I try to tell myself I'm crazy. This is fine. I don't let on to him that I'm nervous. I act cool. On the picture, imagine we are in the top left, where the name is. We start walking east, the top of the Forte (the forte isn't in the picture - only the water because it has a mote). So we are walking along the Mississippi river side. 

He takes me a little off the path, towards the forte to where part of the mote is. He shines his light on the water and says, ""See those lights? Those are alligators/crocodiles (I don't remember which)."" He was showing me their eyes reflecting from the flashlight. At this time, he picks up a BIG stick, like part of a tree branch. I'm standing not to close to the water, but not very far either. 

This is when I panick. I mean seriously panick. 

I keep my cool though. Something told me not to let on that I was scared. So I acted like nothing was weird and I was relieved when we returned to the path, leaving the mote behind us. At this point he has the stick and the flashlight. And I walk slightly behind him. I'm terrified of walking in front of him by this point. The lights are dim in this area. Very dim. He tells me we have two choices. We can walk the long way, where there is more light. Or we can take a shortcut across a field and we will get to the car much faster. 

If you have read this far, please tell me what you would have done. 

I make a quick decision to cut across the field. It was dark, but not pitch black in the small wooded area and there was decent light on the field. On the map, I'm now at the south eastern part of the forte, and the field is directly south of it. I want to get back in that car more than anything in the world. 

I don't remember him carrying the stick at this point, but he still had the huge flashlight. 

We walk across a large field. Very large. Like maybe the kind of field where you would play like soccer or something. This is the most terrifying part of the story for me. Please tell me if I was over reacting. 

As we are somewhere about mid point in the field, we come across a pair of woman's shoes. Out in an empty field, in the middle of fucking nowhere. This is the point where I really start fearing for my life. What are the fucking chances of this?????? I still don't want to show fear. So I laugh and remark how strange it is finding these shoes. I say Id like to take a picture because it's so weird, right? He lets me use his phone, and I take the picture. 

I play it cool. I keep chatting with him. I can't even tell you what we talked about at the forte. I was just focused on not showing fear. I don't remember at all what we talked about. I had one goal. Make it to the car. 

The parking lot comes into view, and it took all I had not to run. Speaking of running. Run where? We aren't even near the road. There's no buildings out here. No signs of life. And he's a professional runner. I would have no chance. 

Thank fucking God, but we get in the car and start driving. I think we are heading the right way if I remembered the way we came in correctly. He asked if I wanted to go further south, to the actual town of Venice. By this time it's starting to get light outside. I  politely tell him maybe another time, that I need to get home. At this point I lie and say my roommates will be worried about me. 

He drops me off at my car. I smile and tell him I had a fun night with him. And we go our separate ways. 

My heart was racing. 

Now, when I tell this story to people. I get two possible explanations for this bizarre night. Most people think he had nefarious plans. Some think the fact that I showed no fear made him not as interested in carrying anything out. Other people suggest this was just a socially awkward man who completely innocently thought he was taking me on a fun and unique date and that he didn't realize what he was doing could scare a woman. 

So, Reddit. What do you think? 

Out of curiosity, I met him one more time after that. I just had to know if I met him again, if there was anything I could observe that was off about him. It was in an extremely crowded place during the day. I think we got coffee. And he seemed normal. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary. He was charismatic and he was at no point during our time together socially awkward. 

Needless to say, we never spoke again. I don't recall if he ever reached out and maybe I ghosted. I don't remember us talking after that. 

The interesting thing is I can't tell you anything we talked about that night even though we were together for hours. He was unremarkable. I don't remember the conversation being interesting at all. The only thing I remember was the chat at the bar where he mentioned his home town and the fort.

I've never told this story on Reddit. Hopefully someone read this novel and can give their opinions. ",5,1746809879.0,AmIOverreacting,16,0.73,False
1kinggm,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/comments/1kinggm/protip_when_in_tokyo_do_the_simple_and_obvious/,"ProTip: When in Tokyo, do the simple and obvious","I know the title sounds weird but hear me out. I noticed a pattern with some posts where people were struggling to get a good experience on their trip, especially in Tokyo, and I think it‚Äôs a cultural thing where they‚Äôre used to hunting for special deals or shortcuts or secret tips and tricks in their home country and apply the same to Japan. Now I‚Äôm not saying those don‚Äôt exist in Tokyo, but very often, just doing the simple, straightforward and obvious thing will get you a good enough result both for budget and convenience. This is less specific advice and more general observation.

Example 1: Local trains. Just get an IC card (Suica / Pasmo), charge it, tap it at the gates, done. Yes I know there‚Äôs 24h subway passes and whatnot, and by all means if you want to get a PhD in Tokyo public transport you might be able to save the equivalent of a cup of coffee, but really, you‚Äôre here for just a few days, just make sure you don‚Äôt lose too much time getting lost and leave paying to your trusty Suica.

Example 2: Buying things. We get a lot of posts about thrift shopping and whether it‚Äôs OK to buy from that sketchy street vendor in Ameyoko street, but really, Tokyo people just go to the official shop, buy the thing new, and done. If they‚Äôre bargain hunting, it‚Äôs usually with point cards and coupons. Sure flea markets exist, but outside of broke-ass students and grandmas on small pensions, it‚Äôs just not really a Tokyo thing.

Example 3: Food. I know this sounds silly as advice but just check Google Maps for a decent nearby restaurant and eat there? There‚Äôs so many cheap good eateries and local chains all over town. I know there‚Äôs always someone on social media who will rave about combini egg sandwiches or those overpriced wagyu skewers at Tsukiji but really, don‚Äôt try to find a cheap lifehack to fill your belly, just go somewhere where you can sit down to have a professional cook you a meal in exchange for coinage? (There‚Äôs a longer story here where Tokyo had a long tradition of street food going back to the Edo period, but it went away with the post-war economic boom. You can still find the occasional food truck selling lunch bentos in office areas and if you come across one, sure, try it ‚Ä¶ but please go to a local park to eat, don‚Äôt just stand around in the street.)",65,1746809847.0,JapanTravelTips,27,0.9,False

My blood work showed some big changes from a year ago, all of which were positive. For reference, I weighed the same last year as I do now (I had gained some weight before starting tirz), so it's fun to compare my blood work changes at nearly identical weights:

Glucose: was 97 last year and was 82 yesterday (even though I had two cups of coffee with sugared creamer a couple of hours before my blood draw, oops)

Cholesterol: dropped from 212 to 181

HDL (the good cholesterol): increased from 47 to 49

Triglycerides: dropped from 112 to 88

LDL: dropped from 142 to 99

 Also for reference, I eat more calories now than I did a year ago, and have added a lot more animal protein to my diet since starting tirz.

I‚Äôm on a budget, most of these are less then 10$, with the exception of some that you want ‚Äúmore expensive‚Äù option. Jase has never been an option for me, so I do not have antibiotics unfortunately.

A first aid kit is a prep everyone should have. Seriously this isn‚Äôt even about  post-apocalyptic scenario, if someone gets a mini or cut you should be able to treat it at home. If someone gets seriously hurt having the knowledge to help while you wait for more help is crucial.

The first step of this prep was first aid ‚Äúclasses‚Äù I was fortunate and had to take both first aid and cpr classes for work. So I was all set there. Also started by taking all the phamlets I‚Äôve found at my doctors and urgent care.

Our fire department runs classes for free 2x per year so it‚Äôs worth looking into that too! You can also learn without a class you just have to pick resources wisely. CPR is one thing you have to learn hands on imo, if you have no resources near you knowing the how is ok, but if you can PLEASE take a class. 

We store our first aid kit in our laundry room, in a 40qt bin. It has some weight to it but not enough it would be of hindrance in a evacuation scenario (really we just had major flooding and were on evacuation watch it‚Äôs scary) so this is both a bug in and a bug out kit 

Bottles of extra medications are also in here and easily accessible, we rotate the ones in this kit and our medicine cabinet to avoid expiration dates. 

4 covid tests, (expired but according to Dr are better then nothing) 

Iodine

Isopropyl alcohol 

Isopropyl alcohol swabs

Cotton balls and qtips
 
Sterile 1 use tounge depressor 

Neosporin

N95 masks 

Sterile Gloves 
 
Cover stretch roll

Gauze, both rolls and pads

Bandaids various sizes 

‚ÄúVet wrap‚Äù (cheaper then the human version and the same thing, it should not come in direct contact with a wound)

Aloe 

Scissors both blunt end bandage and normal 

Splinter out 

Wound closures 

Superglue (I know, this is a worst case scenario option) 

Liquid bandage 

Oragel 

Sunscreen (also in other places in our home) 

40% deet bug spray (we live in a tick heavy area, if we have to go we still want protection) 

2 bottles fresh water and a mini soap bar 

Sanitizer 

Thermometer, in ear and an oral one with extra batteries and covers.

Face masks 

Icy hot 

Magnesium spray (I know! But as someone with wicked bad joint pain this is something I don‚Äôt want to be without) 

Colloidal silver (thanks commenter who suggested it) 

1 use cold packs (along with reusable in the freezer)

Finger splints 

Emergency blankets 

Flashlight 

Tweezers, blunt end and needle end 

Eye pads (gauze can also work for this) 

Benadryl stick 

Medical waste ‚Äúbox‚Äù (a metal coffee tin labeled ‚Äúsharps/medical waste‚Äù)

A tourniquet 
Breath shields 

We also have pets and they have a ‚Äúmini kit‚Äù 

Terramycin eye ointment 

High value treats
A muzzle (you can also make muzzles out of gauze in an emergency but you should muzzle train your dog) 

A cone per species (dog and cat lol) 

Leashes 

Vet prescribed terramycin per species 

Dewormer 

Eat cleaner 

Otherwise they share the same thing as us! Don‚Äôt forget your pets. 

If you or anyone you know take medications prescription I strongly recommend seeing if you can get at least and couple days extra of meds. I know this isn‚Äôt something many people have the option for, but if you can, please do! 

Anything else you would add feel free to comment, expensive or not!

1kinc7a,https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1kinc7a/enough_with_the_productivity_bs_already/,Enough With The Productivity BS Already,"OK, can we talk about these ridiculous productivity systems for a minute? I'm so over it.

You know the ones. Those Notion templates you spent an entire weekend setting up? The ones gathering digital dust because...surprise!...they're more complicated than just DOING THE ACTUAL WORK.

And don't get me started on those people with their Instagram worthy desk setups. Seventeen different colored highlighters arranged in perfect ROYGBIV order. Congrats, you color-coded your calendar into oblivion. What are you, mapping the human genome? Nope, just writing ""buy toothpaste"" in teal instead of turquoise. REVOLUTIONARY.

My personal favorite is the ""I wake up at 4AM"" crowd. Oh wow, you chug cold brew in the dark while the rest of us sleep? Here's your medal! ü•á Your body hates you, but at least you finished that audiobook at 2x speed while dry-brushing your skin or whatever.

Look, I fell for it too. I once had a pomodoro timer that made tomato sounds. TOMATO SOUNDS, people! My life was literally measured in pasta sauce increments. If I wanted to live by bells ringing every 25 minutes, I'd go back to high school and hang out with my old algebra teacher who, by the way, was plenty productive with just a chalkboard and pure spite.

Remember ""inbox zero""? That mythical state we're all chasing? I reached it once... for approximately 17 seconds before 23 new emails flooded in. It's like trying to empty the ocean with a coffee mug.

But the real kicker is how much TIME we waste on this stuff. You've got your task manager synced to your calendar synced to your habit tracker synced to your journal app synced to your water reminder app. It's a digital centipede of productivity tools, and you're spending more time feeding the beast than actually producing anything!

Let's be honest about ""deep work"" too. We're all nodding along to Cal Newport while checking our phones every 3 minutes. I literally had to put my phone in another room to write this, and I STILL got up to check it twice. (OK three times. Don't judge me.)

And those habit trackers... good lord. Missed one day of meditation and now your perfect streak is broken? Guess you're a complete failure at life! Better spend two hours setting up a NEW habit tracking system!

Here's what actually works, from someone who's tried all this nonsense and came out the other side:

1. Write down the stuff you need to do. On paper. With a pen. A REGULAR pen from the junk drawer.

2. Do the hardest thing first, while you still have the energy to care.

3. The rest is gravy. Get to it if you can.

That's literally it. Not fancy enough? Doesn't require a subscription? Doesn't have a cool name like ""The Ultimate Productivity Hackstack 3000""? GOOD.

Our parents and grandparents somehow built entire lives without digital task managers. My dad kept his to do list on the back of an envelope and still managed to raise kids and hold down a job. He never once needed an app to remind him to drink water.

Every time you add another layer to your ""productivity stack,"" you're just finding another way to avoid doing actual work. Another thing to fiddle with. Another excuse.

You don't need a better system. You need to turn off Netflix, put your butt in the chair, and just friggin' DO THE THING.

And for the love of everything holy, stop reading about productivity online (yes, I see the irony here). It's like watching cooking shows instead of making dinner. You're still hungry, but now you've wasted an hour.

Now close this tab and go do something that actually matters. And if reading this just helped you procrastinate for five minutes... well, we're in this mess together, aren't we?

P.S. If you feel attacked, good. I wrote this as much for myself as for anyone. Now seriously, go do the thing.

I'm wondering why the price of my Big Mac combo goes up when I get delivery. I was looking at ordering for delivery, but the price jumped for my meal. The service fee and delivery cost were still there, so the increase in price isn't compensating for the delivery. I was just curious. 

The restaurant didn't change, as the delivery would go to the same restaurant as my in-person purchase. The in-person one does delivery, so it's not like the wouldn't offer it and the delivery came from a different restaurant.

I started working at McD's when I realized my mom had stopped wanting to pay my college funds. I needed to pay my rent, There was a small town on the way to my parents‚Äô house just off the highway. Armonica was its name. Maybe a hundred residents. Completely untouched by the outside world, practically forgotten. It was pointless to stop there for any normal reason because there wasn‚Äôt a gas station or rest stop. Not even a sign to let you know you were close. Let‚Äôs just say I had to sneak my way around some very old job applications there to discover that they had one of the few McDonald‚Äôs (aside from some local supermarkets and a small post office) that had yet to go through a exterior remodel since the 1970's and an interior remodel since the 1990's. I was surprised they even had a McDonald's, yet they didn‚Äôt have a Wendy's, Taco Bell, KFC, Burger King, Popeyes Chicken or any other restaraunt (aside from local ones).

I don‚Äôt think I would‚Äôve ever found the place before phone GPS, the turn off from the highway was just a dirt road with no landmarks or anything. As I pulled into town none of the houses had lights on. Most of the street lights were out as well, as though nobody had remembered to change the bulbs in years. This place really was untouched. I‚Äôd be surprised if most of the residents hadn‚Äôt moved out or simply died off. It definitely had the makings of a ghost town, I ended up working there, anyway, and impressed the manager enough to have a suitable income for my situation. Finally, I had enough money to pay my rent, and support myself. Things were good, but I was still looking for other jobs that related to my studies over at college. We had a small staff, consisting of only twelve people. After about a year, I was granted the job of assistant manager. One quiet night, we were ready to work all night (we were working all night because of McDonald's new 24 hour drive-thru system). My shift was all the way from 10:00 to 8:00 in the morning. I thought it would be a slow, boring night, with nothing more than me, and another nine people. The nine people were an old man named John, a middle-aged woman named Kam, a middle-aged man named Frederick, an old woman named Julie, and the rest were a few boys and girls in their late teens and early to late twenties. I was the supervisor for the night, and my boss decided to leave us.

Most of the night, there were no customers to speak of. Well, except for this one guy. He was pretty fat and I guessed that there were some people who wanted their Big Mac fix at 12 at night. After 12, all of us just stood at our posts, sometimes talking, sometimes not. I just looked at the drive thru camera most of the time, looking for something that caught my eye. I did notice a car coming in from the drive thru entrance.

""Gear up, guys,"" I told them, ""there's a customer.""

The car was a yellow-ish 1950's Ford Thunderbird.

""And he's got a sweet car,"" I said to make things more interesting.

I picked up the headset, and spoke into the mic:

""Hello, welcome to McDonald's. May I take your order?""

After a few seconds of silence, I heard a whispering, or a quiet speaking of some sort. This was a bit weird, and I just asked again.

""Sorry sir, could you just repeat that order again?""

After a few minutes of silence, I just regarded the whole situation as odd. I looked over to my co-workers and shrugged. I could tell that John was getting impatient. I asked again:

""Could you give me that order again, please?""

There was silence again. Before I could ask again, John took the headset from me.

""Sir, could you¬†*please*¬†just-""

He was cut off by something. By what, I don't know. The colour faded away from his face immediately. He ripped off the headset and ran to the employee wash room, crying. I was shocked that such a senile old man could break so easily. One of the girls chased him. I put on the headset and heard static. I saw that the cord was cut.

""God dammit, John you broke the headset!""

I looked at the screens, and neither of them had the yellow convertible. Fifteen minutes later, one of the 26-year old males came back with John.

""He said he heard his mother's voice.""

I didn't know whether to yell at him to stop being so crazy, or sympathize with him. I just told him to get back to work, and that I'd take care of the drive thru. The 16-29 yr old girls were clearly looking worried, and a bit scared. As an assistant manager, I had to keep all of my staff under control, and working. I told them just to get back to their posts and wait for me to give them any orders that came through. Earlier on, I had no idea as to what happened. I was thinking of ways that this could be possible.¬†*Were we being pranked?*¬†I thought, as I looked through the cameras once more.¬†*Had they just messed with us on the mic, and sped right past the window?*¬†*No, they couldn't have. I would have heard the engine right outside*. I wasn't a skeptic in earlier parts of my life, but recently, I had stopped believing in such things. I didn't know whether I was losing touch with my religion, or maybe my lack of belief in the supernatural. Needless to say, I had a lesser amount of logic in my mind than before tonight.

It was about an hour later that some weird things started going on. We were all a little tired, and we were all about to take mini-shifts where we would all take quick naps. I looked down at the cameras once more and noticed a bit of fuzz going on. I tapped the screen lightly, and that seemed to fix it for a couple seconds. It started to get a bit more fuzzy than before after I tried to fix it again. After a few more times of 'fixing' it, I noticed something really peculiar going on in the top-right corner of the screen. There was some guy who appeared to be dressed up as Ronald McDonald walking down the side walk that was just barely out of view. After the clown guy had passed, there was another guy also dressed as Ronald McDonald just seconds afterwards.

""Hey guys, check this out.""

I said, pointing to the screen. Once I had said that, the guy stopped, and looked over to the camera. I felt like he heard me somehow. He then continued to walk and then there was no more of the hoodie guy.

""Never mind.""

The screen started to clear up again. By that time, I had really started to get tired. I would have taken a nap, but for some reason there's a rule about the manager, supervisor or assistant manager not taking naps, and knowing John, he'd rat me out in a second. So, I went to the office that was in the back, and just did some paperwork that needed to get taken care of. I just needed to fill out what was used in the night, how much we made. It's actually very simple stuff. While I was working on the papers, I noticed this red piece of the paper that was in the pile. I picked it out, and read it. It said:

**""THE PLAY PLACE BALLPIT""**

Of course, I could understand it, but the writing was very sloppy, and reminded me a bit of the name of a horror movie about a fast food restaurants play area. I chuckled a bit and went to consult my co-workers. I asked them if they had left the piece of paper in the office, but all they said in return was:

""The office had been locked all day and we're too tired to pull any pranks.""

I just left it in the office and went to check on the cameras.

I got to the cameras only to find them busted. All the screens were cracked, and the headset was emitting this weird static noise.

""Guys! Who the fuck did this?"" I questioned in an extremely angry tone.

""I thought I heard something,"" said one of the males.

""What did you hear?""

He seemed to have a higher I.Q than the other boys or girls, who just seemed to text on their phones half the day, so I was surprised to see that he didn't check the noise.

""I heard a bit of tapping and then a loud banging sound. It only lasted for a couple seconds, so I thought someone else was over there.""

""I thought you were over there"" said one of the girls, texting on her phone.

Why their phones have so much power, I'll never understand.

""Well, I wasn't,"" I said in a shaky voice.

For the next few minutes, we just stood there, not talking. It was kind of eerie, actually. It was all silent, and I could hear nothing except the static of the headset-¬†*The headset*¬†I thought, realizing the chord had been broken earlier. I ran over to the headset, checking to see if my theory was going anywhere. Sure enough, I was correct. The chord was completely disconnected, but it was still making noise. I felt my blood run cold, and the hairs on my neck stand up as I slowly put on the headset. All I heard was a disarray of static, and I didn't even know what to say, so I stammered out a weak ""Hello?""

As soon as I spoke, the headset blared out a loud and disoriented:

""**THE-B-B-BALLPIT**"" followed by an eerie, long chuckle

It was so loud that I ripped off the headset as soon as I heard it. After that, I told them not to go anywhere outside the restaraunt or in the play area.

As the night went on, I tried to get the screens fixed, but I couldn't so I just told the employees to watch the windows every once in a while. It started to get a little hot, which was strange since it was in the middle of October. All I knew, it was always very cool during the night. I regarded it as just a change in temperature. The night went on, silently, and eerily. I made some hourly rounds, and it was nearly 4 in the morning when I noticed Kam and Julie and one of the boys had gone missing.

""What happened?"" I asked Frederick, since he and John know a lot about what's happening, more than me and everybody else.

""How am I supposed to know?"" he snapped back, snarling a bit as he did so.

""Aren't you supposed to keep track of them? I ain't no babysitter. I'm just doing my job.""

He was right. This could badly effect my performance, and ruin the stable relationship I have with my manager. I looked in the back, and saw that all of their stuff was gone.¬†*Where could they have gone?*¬†I thought as I opened her locker. Her phone was still here, so she couldn't have gone far. I went over to the screens and tried to fix them again, to see if I could make some more progress. About an hour later, I finally fixed the screens. By this time, I was sweating like a dog in the desert. It was so hot, that the air was almost like warm blankets. I looked at the screens, and all of them were this dark shade of red.

""Oh shit."" I said to myself, as I saw the headless bodies of several teenagers in the bottom-left corner of the camera's view all drenched in a black, bubbling and oozing liquid.

I ran to the window and tried to open it, but as soon as i did, it suddenly snapped closed right on my fingers. The metal dug deep into my flesh leaving a dark trail of blood down the side of the counter. I yelped in pain.

Behind the counter at the other end of the grill was a first aid kit hanging on the wall. The lights were now burned out in the kitchen area but I needed a bandage, pronto. I hopped over the table and made my way to the back. The burning smell was getting stronger as I walked. I noticed the grill was covered in a thick layer of grease, completely unsuitable for cooking. I passed by the frying station and the oil was filled to the top with maggots. Things were starting to get really eerie down here,

I quickened my walk to the first aid hoping to get patched up and out of there as soon as possible. I opened up the first aid kit and had to swallow some vomit.

A cloud of mold burst out from it in every direction followed by the same bubbling black ooze that was on the dead bodies outside. I started coughing and waving my hands in the air to clear the mold dust floating around.

The same voice that warned us about a ball pit tune started up again as I steadied myself. I assumed the headsets were now broken just like the rest of this dump now. I looked back toward the counter and noticed everything seemed farther away. I must have been disoriented from losing blood and the heat. I looked down at my hand to see how bad the wound was and my eyes widened. There was no wound on my hand at all.

I ran back to the window and tried to open it. It wouldn't budge. In fact, none of the windows would open. I ran to the back door, and tried to open it.¬†*I have to get out of here*¬†I thought, as I tried to bust the door down. It would not open, no matter how hard I tried. By now, I was feeling weak, and I noticed that no one else was around except for me. I looked out of the drive thru window at an angle so I could see what exactly happened. It looked like someone had ran them over with a tractor. Blood and the black liquid was everywhere and it looked like some of her entrails were splattered along the wall. I threw up at the sight.

I rushed back towards the counter in a panic when something under the stove caught my foot and I fell. In the darkness my eyes started to adjust and I saw the outline of a body. Somebody was under there. Maybe they were unconscious and needed help! I yanked at the person‚Äôs arm and a half decayed body slid out across the floor.

They were wearing a McDonalds‚Äô employee shirt with a name-tag that read ####. Their mouth was contorted into a sickening grin but their eyes were screaming. I tried to shout but no sound came out like when trying to wake up from a nightmare. As I scrambled to get back up to the counter, the lights had started to dim and the voice was getting louder, the tones fizzling and distorting as they repeated.

Once I had gotten my grip above the counter, I froze.

Since entering, I never looked at the side of the restaurant opposite the counter. There was a play place as i had mentioned.

The glass separating the main restaurant from the play area had hundreds of bloody hand-prints smearing down toward the floor. The tube slide was caved in with chunks of red liquid spurting out from the tiny hole left at the bottom. There was a row of nooses tied to the monkey bars in the corner with employees wearing the same #### name-tags hanging from them and the same look on their faces and eyes. The tables around the perimeter had skeletons with rotting food left on trays, some of the food hanging from the skulls‚Äô mouths. I looked on in horror, too shocked to move.

While the rest of the restaurant went dark, a bulb in the center of the play place continued to glow like a carnival spotlight. Below it was a massive ball pit, barely able to contain all of its colored plastic balls. It was smoking under the blaring white light, making an awful burning plastic smell.

The balls began to rattle and fall off the edge when something inside started shuffling around. I wanted to run so badly but my body refused. Then suddenly the music went dead and the movement stopped.

A yellow glove slowly crept upward from the pit below, writhing its fingers as it went. A connected red and white sleeve came after it, slowly alternating colors as they appeared from underneath. The arm continued to reach toward the sky, growing more and more, while its joints popped and cracked like breaking branches. By the end that arm had to be at least six feet long.

It finally reached for the lit bulb on the ceiling with its gangly gloved fingers and began to twist it loose.

I broke into a sprint, jumping over the counter and toppling chairs as I went. That last light went out just as I got to the exit. I ran to the right of the restaurant, and tried to exit through the glass doors that led inside. I looked for something to break open the windows. I wanted to break out of here so badly, but at the same time, I wanted to be cold. I was getting so tired of the blistering heat.

I went over behind the counter and disconnected the cash register. I threw it at the glass, but the glass seemed to reflect it back at me. It nearly hit me in the knee.  I heard something making a hissing noise behind me. It was the grill, it was hissing, and the grease traps were smoking. The grill suddenly burst into flames, which made the heat unbearable.

I broke into a sprint, jumping over the counter and toppling chairs as I went. The roof had been set on fire just as I got to the exit.

As I rolled into the parking lot I heard a distant scream, and then something whispered right next to my ear in dead silence. It had the same tinny distortion as the voice warning us about the ballpit

**‚ÄúCome back. I want to see you smile.‚Äù**

I haven‚Äôt told anyone about what happened there that night. There was an article online saying several buildings and businesses in Armonica burned to the ground a few days later. I don‚Äôt know if it was a cover up or something else, but I‚Äôm never going back to find out.

I didn‚Äôt share this because I want you to get involved, by the way. I shared it to warn you what happens when you work at an old McDonald's with a ballpit.

You can go to a new McDonald‚Äôs, keep getting your Big Macs, get your McCafe coffee, that‚Äôs fine. They did something to the remodels to make them safe, at least for now.  
But don‚Äôt ever go into an old McDonald‚Äôs. Not even the drive thru or the playplace.

I‚Äôve got to stop typing now and get some pain meds.

I'm intentionally not adding any judgments ‚Äî to be honest, I still don‚Äôt fully know how I feel about it.
My first relationship was with a guy who was 23 when I was still in late school (sorry, I am scared that reddit will ban me). We were both part of the same 'alternative' social group (goths) ‚Äî I was the youngest, and he was the oldest. We texted a lot. He didn‚Äôt stand out much, just felt more appealing than the others. I didn‚Äôt make any first moves ‚Äî we talked for a few months, and eventually he started subtly hinting at something, though I wasn‚Äôt sure what his intentions were.
At some point, he told me he liked me (maybe even said he loved me ‚Äî I honestly don‚Äôt remember) and asked if I wanted to be in a relationship. I said yes, because I was curious and liked talking to him.
We didn‚Äôt sleep together right away. To be honest, I thought I had to ‚Äî like being in a relationship with an older guy meant sex was expected. But it didn‚Äôt feel bad to me at all. I was actually excited. I wasn‚Äôt specifically attracted to him sexually (though I didn‚Äôt realize that then), but I was extremely curious about sex. I had been masturbating daily for years and was intensely interested.
He suggested it after about six months, through an online conversation. He said it was up to me and I could say no. I remember thinking ‚Äúfinally.‚Äù He took things slowly ‚Äî the first time was just oral and touching, and only the second time we had full sex. He was gentle and careful.
We didn‚Äôt see each other often ‚Äî he lived far away with his parents, about 1.5 or even 2 hours away. He said he needed to focus on his studies and couldn‚Äôt come into town more often. I was frustrated that we didn‚Äôt have more sex ‚Äî it didn‚Äôt seem important to him. Even when he visited, he often preferred we hang out with the our goth group instead of spending time alone together. I didn‚Äôt understand why.
I don‚Äôt think he was cheating (but, I have to say, his future wife is from the same goth group). He was online constantly, always quick to reply, emotionally available.
We broke up amicably. I needed more attention and emotion; he preferred calm and predictability.
I didn‚Äôt think the age gap was an issue at the time. But later people started saying that 23 vs 1X is kind of inappropriate. Maybe that‚Äôs true in most cases. Ironically, the people I dated afterward ‚Äî some closer to my age, including one girl ‚Äî were actually way worse for me. I got STIs, emotional traumas, and way more damage from those later relationships.
Please don‚Äôt ask where my parents were. That‚Äôs another topic. You can probably guess some things based on this story.
I‚Äôm curious what you think:
About this guy
About my experience
Is this age gap always something amoral and bad?
For context, I‚Äôm now 30. I am twice older now. He is married now and for a long time. We still grab coffee maybe once a year just to talk. He usually treats.",0,1746809214.0,Advice,2,0.5,False

AITAH?","This is a silly story from 2 years ago but for context, there‚Äôs this girl at my office who has been lowkey making my life hell since I started this job. You know the type who steals your ideas in meetings, ""forgets"" to CC you on important emails, and once ""accidentally"" spilled her coffee all over my FACE (it lowkey burned) while giving me that oopsie smile that absolutely wasn‚Äôt an accident.  

I‚Äôve been seething about it for months, but I‚Äôm not the kind of person to make a scene. HR wouldn‚Äôt do anything, and honestly? I wanted to hit back in a way that hurt but wouldn‚Äôt get me fired.

My coworker is obsessive about her coffee. She brings in this bougie, small-batch, single-origin nonsense that costs like $30 a bag and keeps it in the break room like it‚Äôs Fort Knox.

I played it cool at my desk, pretending to work while waiting for the show and i heard the sip and saw the moment of regret, she chugged water like she‚Äôd just licked the ocean afterwardsüíÄ she then sniffed the coffee like maybe it had betrayed her.

I came away with these beauties. Both '6-dot', both in Good to Very Good condition minus the typical wear and tear. HEY! You be 63 yo and tell me how YOU would look! LOL

Seriously, the covers are great, the spines are in terrific condition and the surfaces are well cared for (which is astonishing since the owner tossed away the internal sleeves). There were several other items as well: Several overseas SW radios, a nice Sony RtR, a Sherwood amp but all were ridiculously overpriced, although I almost dropped $45 on a Philco cathedral-style tube radio.

1kin40p,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1kin40p/should_i_be_concerned/,Should I Be Concerned?,"Hello!

I've been doing my calorie deficit for 4 days now (today being day 5). I usually don't even make it one day, no matter how small the deficit. It was very triggering to my mind. I've worked through a lot of that and wanted to try again.

Quick stats: 33 yo female, 5'2, 285 lbs

Just before starting, I had done a couple of 16-18 hour fasts. While they came from a place of punishing myself at the time, the good thing was that it's almost like it reset my appetite. A few days later I started my calorie deficit.

Now here we are 5 days in, and while I can tell I am ""under fueled"" so to speak, the sharp painful hunger has gone. It's so weird! I have been eating anywhere from 1200-1500 calories most days. I only intended to do a 500 calorie deficit, which would be 1870 calories. Somehow it's like it's almost easier to stay quite low than do a more moderate deficit. But how can that be?

I don't feel the sharp hunger pang feeling, but I can tell I'm ""undereating"" and I do often feel kind of weak and like my leg muscles feel hollow when I walk around. I don't know how else to describe it! I also am feeling a bit afraid to eat more. I don't eat breakfast, do have coffee and creamer, get to lunch and have a small lunch which makes me feel SO full, it's nuts! Then a snack a few hours later.  I start to get a bit irritable and tired in the afternoon and evening. On average I'm at 700-800 calories at this point in the day. I don't feel particularly bad though. I get through my work day and go home. I eat dinner and I'm usually at 1200-1500 calories depending on what I ate for dinner.

After dinner I do feel the desire to eat some more, but the thought also kind of grosses me out. On top of that, I'm kind of afraid to eat more. When I try to dig into that fear and understand it more, I think it is a fear that if I eat a bit more (still in a deficit) I will lose the control I currently have over my hunger and appetite. As if eating more will be stoking the fire of my appetite. I don't necessarily believe that would happen, but the fear is there.

Should I be concerned that I'm eating so far below my maintenance? Is it a different ballgame when I'm starting out morbidly obese for my height? Could my body be improving its leptin sensitivity from what is essentially intermittent fasting (since I don't have breakfast)? Should I be concerned that I'm afraid to eat more? Is that a normal fear when in the past I've always failed at weight loss? Maybe it's just a phase and I need to trust the process? I don't want to trigger binge eating. But also I want to get some fat off and feel more comfortable! Maybe I should enjoy the more manageable hunger now and increase a little if the intense hunger comes back?

I also think having been in the intuitive eating/non-diet/ED recovery world for a while has warped my thinking to some degree. It has helped me immensely in the mental aspect and I don't think I could be doing a calorie deficit at all without having worked on detaching my identity and self esteem from my weight/appearance (which is still an ongoing process). Maybe some of those talking points are subconsciously floating around in my mind and making me question my own decisions?

I mean yes, I am hungry, I'm in a pretty good deficit, but it's not the extreme sharp painful kind of hunger. I can pretty easily forget about it if I start playing a game or talking to people or working etc. Is this just a natural part of weight loss and I'm actually nailing it?! And this anti-diet stuff is just messing with me?

I'll add that while I do feel sort of afraid to increase my calories a bit, if I felt sick or like I was going to pass out, I would eat. That would  push me past the hesitancy to eat, I think. This weird experience is making me feel empowered and strong. But is that messed up bc I'm feeling strong by denying myself food? Or is it all about context - for someone with a restrictive ED this would be bad, for someone who is obese and working to lose weight it might be good?

Thanks for making it this far! Please be kind, I'm sensitive and just dipping my toes back into pursuing weight loss.

You mean I get to have my coffee, read, go on my phone, even eat, AND have my baby in my arms, sound asleep, and I can get kisses and sniffs in?! I really do mean it when I say I have nothing else better to do because what's better than this?! My to-do list will always look the same - my baby will not!

I have to say that I'm a FTM and we get pretty good sleeps at night now - he sleeps in his crib and wakes up a couple times. And I feel like that helps contribute to my love of contact naps. It feels like a privilege to love them?!

I've tried putting him in his crib for naps but so far, he sleeps better contact napping during the day so it's not like I'm sacrificing his sleep. 

I feel like contact naps are just as much for me as they are for him. To anyone who says it'll be harder when he gets older, I'm willing to risk it and try to figure it out when I get there. Sometimes I do feel guilty for loving these naps, but they're only little for a little.

1kin2p5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1kin2p5/have_you_ever_been_kept_in_a_loop_by_the_main/,Have you ever been kept in a loop by the Main Office?,"Maybe more of a discussion than a question but tldr: I got stuck in a loop of waking up into another dream, overall theme of a mysterious ‚ÄòMain Office‚Äô and maybe some kind of dream testing. Has anyone experienced anything similar?

full (long) dream explanation:

The loop started out with me waking up from a nap at a friend‚Äôs house late in the evening. I‚Äôd leave the room I woke up in and remember vaguely thinking about needing to call the office, but not thinking much more about it. My friend would see me and we‚Äôd have a short chat, just catching up, and they‚Äôd always tell me ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre so glad to have you here‚Äô either right before or shortly before I woke up in the room again.

After about three loops there, I realized something wasn‚Äôt quite right, not necessarily that I was dreaming but that the place looked different than I remembered. Then, I was in my car trying to reach some destination, possibly home, in less than thirty minutes, but the roads kept changing. I‚Äôd be driving somewhere that seemed semi-familiar, realize it wasn‚Äôt quite right, then I‚Äôd suddenly be driving somewhere else, sometimes at a completely different time of day, feeling more and more disoriented each time. Several loops into this, I finally had the realization I was dreaming, then I then woke up at home.

At first, things seemed normal, like I‚Äôd woken up for real. Then I noticed how everyone would look at me when I was in the room, how they kept saying they were ‚Äòhappy I was here‚Äô, and I realized I was still in the dream. The loop reset, but my awareness didn‚Äôt, I still knew I was in a dream. Having never been able to lucid dream before, and having experienced getting stuck in a loop before, I decided to try and wait it out by testing out changing the dream. I tried to fly and I got a few feet off the ground, then a large dog came running at me. I told myself it wasn‚Äôt real, and when it lunged at me I was able to grab it, as soon as I did it became a stuffed animal and I tossed it away harmlessly. The dream reset.

Every time I proved myself capable of bending the dream enough to counter whatever danger was sent at me, a different/bigger danger was sent. When I was finally starting to get overwhelmed and just wanted to wake up, I took out my phone and tried to call someone, but the numbers didn‚Äôt show up. The dream reset. I tried again, the numbers came up but they were wrong, some missing and some repeating and some bigger than others, and whichever ones I typed would delete as soon as I dialed them. The dream reset again, and this time I went for the home phone, where I was actually able to dial, so I tried to dial 911 but the following messages appeared on the screen: ‚ÄòWhy would you want us to call the OFPD? You need to contact the Main Office.‚Äô

I immediately went cold in fear, but I didn‚Äôt have time to process that because my aunt came into the kitchen and saw me with the phone. She said something along the lines of ‚ÄòOh, you‚Äôre trying to find the Main Office? I‚Äôve been looking for it too, but it looks like you‚Äôll get there before me.‚Äô It was very casual and nonchalant, like she was looking for a coffee and not a way to escape. I looked at her, shocked and confused, then the dream reset. I woke up, and before I even looked around I could tell I was alone, and the ceiling didn‚Äôt really look like my bedroom. I began to sit up, then I woke up for real this time.

I‚Äôm a relatively levelheaded skeptic, but considering that both of my loop dreams had similar vibes of proving myself capable of overcoming danger by realizing I‚Äôm dreaming and then using that to overcome the loops only to wake up right before I see the face of someone I assume to be some kind of dream higher power, I‚Äôm curious if anyone else has gotten stuck in dreams where it feels like they‚Äôre a test subject for this unseen Main Office.",1,1746808893.0,Dreams,0,1.0,False

Sometimes I have a hard time controlling my bladder. I have a tendency to feel like I have to pee A LOT throughout the day and to be totally honest I do not stay hydrated enough. Sometimes I get the urge out of nowhere and yet still once I get to the bathroom it seems like nothing wants to come back and my body changed its mind. And other times it will hit me out of nowhere and I struggle to get there in time. It isn't bad enough where I haven't made it. But it's still interesting to me. I am autistic and from what I've heard and read being able to tell when you have to go to the bathroom seems to be a struggle for autistic people. Also my entire life I've always had the problem of no bladder control when I am going #2. It just kind of releases and I end up peeing on the ground because it just shoots out when I didn't even know I had to go. Its also always been hard to completely empty my bladder. When I'm laughing hard I tend to let some slip out. This happened a lot more frequently when I was younger but I also used to laugh harder and more often lol. Like I previously said sometimes I feel like I need to pee and can't and this happens even when I feel like I'm gonna burst and then suddenly it's gone. I don't drink alcohol but I do drink probably way too much iced coffee. Like I said these are all things that I just figured everyone else dealt with but I was told otherwise by a few friends and it got me thinking.

I posted this review for this listing: [Ocean view of Punta del Este! Playa Mansa. Port. - Apartments for Rent in Punta del Este, Departamento de Maldonado, Uruguay - Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/1097112774740107334?source_impression_id=p3_1746807353_P3k_tUU_yNaxi11K) \--- [Juliana Fotia](https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/563423739) 

April 2025 Juliana is a wonderful person and she has a place in a perfect location! Her place has so much potential! The challenge is it needs quite a bit of maintenance and some updates to layout that can be difficult to manage as an older person. For example the bathroom had a shower with no stall (wet bathroom) or sinks that were so low they were designed for children. Two of the three bathrooms seem very fancy just very difficult to use as the sinks and toilet placements make getting through the door difficult or you constantly got wet from washing your hands. Some of the plumbing just needs some TLC. The kitchen cabinets are getting old so you need to be careful opening them. And the smell of gas from exhaust in the garage can be a bit overwhelming besides the fact they have a firepit grill in the house which also smells. The laundry machine was also broken but Juliana was kind enough to offer us free laundry service. I wish her all the best and I hope this review helps when booking. 

Her Response on my profile!!!:  [Juliana Fotia](https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/563423739) April 2025Horrible experiencia. No recomiendo!!! Exige reembolso sin justificaci√≥n. No lo volver√© a alojar jam√°s.

My response after that: Please review my review of her place. I always try to find the silver lining but in this case it was difficult. I wish Juliana the best and hope she can fix the problems for her guests in the future.

AirBnB won't post my review because it violates some sort of policy but they won't tell me what. On the other hand they won't take down her post even though I shared all the details of the mold, dirt, bathrooms with no shower stall, broken coffee machine and broken laundry machine.  So I get a ding on my profile and she gets off scott free! So frustrated.  I have all the pictures of the broken down place that I shared with AirBnB and this lady and they say no it is fine to have moldy hair and junk all over her house with broken things... Odd thing is I got out of the house immediately and AirBnB gave me a refund for the nights not stayed. So I guess its ok to give a refund for a place that is crap but to try and find a silver lining when posting a review for a shithole is not allowed. Guess we can't tell the truth in this world anymore. Even when coated with sugar but yes you will be penalized... you are always at fault. ",1,1746808682.0,needhelp,0,1.0,False

We were just variables in an experiment. If we cried, they turned up the music. If we screamed, they gagged us. But some still felt guilt‚Ä¶ and that made it worse. Because they hated themselves‚Äîand they took it out on us.‚Äù`



`""But then...you led them to freedom?"", officer Davies asked.`

`""I didn't lead..."", Anne said, ""My restraints had just grown old and damaged...and I could free myself after a scientist forgot to fasten one and another one had ripped. They had had a party before, because they had finally found the Cure...they always had parties after major breakthroughs where I was on a leash and had to serve drinks...they were hungover and forgot to check my restraints on the lab table, then went out to use the toilet and have coffee...and I was able to free myself...because my restraints were dameged. I found a gun...to execute failed subjects and called the police, but when they found me I had to shoot them all, they said they were going to torture me to death...and then...you arrived...""`



`Officer Davies and Jones exchanged a look that held a mixture of horror and professional grimness. Anne's voice was flat, devoid of the tremor it had held at the beginning, as if recounting these atrocities was now just stating facts.`



`""You... you had to shoot them?"" Officer Jones asked, his voice barely above a whisper.`



`""Yes. They said they would make me feel everything everyone else felt, but slower,"" Anne said, her gaze fixed on something far away. ""I just... I didn't want to feel anything more. I shot them until they stopped moving. Then I used their phone to call.""`



`Officer Davies leaned forward, his expression softening slightly despite the weight of her words. ""Anne, you did what you had to do to survive. You are safe now. Absolutely safe.""`



`""How did you get into there?"", officer Jones asked.`

`Anne started to tremble.`

`""W-well mister Greens, the infamous Serial Killer, sold me into there for three hundred Dollars after killing my parents...but not after I had to watch him mutilate their bodies‚Ä¶""`



`The air in the room grew heavy, thicker than before. Officer Davies and Jones exchanged another look, this one laced with a new layer of horror, a grim understanding dawning in their eyes. The details of the lab were monstrous, but the origin‚Ä¶ that a child was sold after witnessing her parents' murder by a known killer added a sickening, unfathomable depth to the tragedy.`



`Officer Jones ran a hand over his face, a muscle ticking in his jaw. ""Mister Greens... we knew he was a monster, but... this."" He trailed off, unable to find the words.`



`Anne hugged herself tighter, her small body trembling visibly now. The flat, distant tone she had adopted when describing the lab's atrocities fractured, replaced by a raw, vulnerable fear.`



`""H-he... he tied me up,"" she whispered, her voice barely audible. ""After... after he finished. He left me there for a long time. Then he took me... in his dirty car. It smelled bad. Like blood and... and something sweet and rotten."" She paused, her eyes wide and unfocused, seeing something the officers couldn't. ""He talked about the money. Three hundred dollars. Said I was 'damaged goods' but they'd still pay because I was young. He drove for a long time.""`



`She shivered violently. ""Then... we got to a building. It didn't look like a lab from the outside. Just... a big, grey building. He took me inside. Down a long hallway. There were people in white coats. They... they didn't look at him much. They looked at me. Like I was... an object.""`



`""And that's where you first saw Miss Cond and Mister Kahn?"" Officer Davies prompted gently, trying to guide her back to the parts of the story she seemed more able to recount without completely breaking down.`



`Anne nodded, the motion jerky. ""Yes. The highest level. It was... bright. Very clean. They took me away from him. He just... left. With the money, I guess."" A tear finally tracked a path down her cheek. ""They took blood. And... and they scanned me. And injected me. Miss Cond was there. She looked sad. Mister Kahn brought my first food... through a slot.""`



`Her voice grew a little steadier as she focused back on the structure she had described earlier, the lab itself providing a form of emotional shield compared to the raw trauma preceding it.`



`""I was in a small room. Like the cell I ended up in later, but... cleaner. And not underground. I stayed there for a while. Just injections. Scans. They measured me. Took my temperature. Everything was... sterile. Like I said. No one touched me much. Only with needles.""`



`""How long were you on the highest level?"" Officer Jones asked, his voice low.`



`""A few days...Children were moved down very quickly, because the not-so-desensetized employees might react to them differently than to adults‚Ä¶""`



`She paused, taking a shaky breath. ‚ÄúThen‚Ä¶ they moved me. They put a blindfold on me. And they wheeled me in something. It felt like a cage on wheels. It was dark and smelled metallic. I heard doors closing. And the air got‚Ä¶ heavier. Colder. And the sounds changed. Less humming of machines. More‚Ä¶ distant cries.‚Äù`



`Her body began to tense again, the relative calm of recounting the sterile highest level evaporating.`



`‚ÄúWhen they took the blindfold off,‚Äù Anne continued, her voice dropping, ‚ÄúI was in a different room. Smaller. The walls were darker. And there was‚Ä¶ there was a man. He wasn‚Äôt in a clean white coat like on the highest level. His was stained. And his eyes‚Ä¶‚Äù She shuddered. ‚ÄúHe was smiling. But not a nice smile.‚Äù`



`‚ÄúThe black sheep,‚Äù Officer Davies murmured, his jaw tight.`



`Anne nodded mutely. ‚ÄúYes. He was there. And there were others. Scientists. They looked‚Ä¶ nervous. Like they didn‚Äôt know what to do. The black sheep‚Ä¶ he came up to me. He pinched my arm. Hard.‚Äù She rubbed her arm instinctively, though the original injury was long gone. ‚ÄúIt hurt. And I cried.‚Äù`



`‚ÄúWhat did the others do?‚Äù Officer Jones asked, his voice tight with controlled anger.`



`‚ÄúAt first‚Ä¶ nothing,‚Äù Anne said, her gaze distant again. ‚ÄúThey just watched. Some looked away. One woman covered her mouth. But the black sheep‚Ä¶ he laughed. And he did it again. And again. To me, and to the other kids who were brought there.‚Äù`



`‚ÄúAnd the scientists‚Ä¶ they started to copy him?‚Äù Officer Davies prompted gently.`



`‚ÄúYes,‚Äù Anne confirmed, a chilling flatness returning to her tone. ‚ÄúThey saw that he wasn‚Äôt stopped. That no one cared. And‚Ä¶ I think they were scared too. Scared of him, maybe. Or scared of being moved down if they didn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ fit in. So they started. At first, just little things. A poke. A rough grab. But it got worse. Like I said. The power‚Ä¶ it changed them. They learned that they could do anything to us. And no one would stop them. No one upstairs would even know.‚Äù`



`‚ÄúHow long were you on that level?‚Äù Officer Jones asked, writing furiously in his notebook.`



`‚ÄúMaybe‚Ä¶ maybe two months?‚Äù Anne said, trying to recall. ‚ÄúIt felt longer. Every day was‚Ä¶ waiting for it. Waiting for someone to decide they were bored, or angry. Waiting to be hurt. And then‚Ä¶ I was moved again. Down.‚Äù Her voice was barely a whisper now, the memory a heavy weight pressing down on her. ‚ÄúTo the third level. And then...well I told you what happened.‚Äù`



`""Well...I think you'd be happy to know that mister Greens was caught?"", Officer Davies asked, ""He got hit by a car. He is in a coma as we speak.""`

`""Yes...very happy..."", Anne said with a tired voice.`



`Officer Jones knelt down to Annes Level.`

`""Well. I guess that was all we want to know from you, Anne. You have been very brave to tell us this.""`

`""O-okay..."", Anne said, ""Can you drive me back to the hospital now?""`



`Officer Jones gave a slow nod, then stood up and placed a gentle hand on Anne‚Äôs shoulder. ‚ÄúOf course. We‚Äôll drive you back right away.‚Äù`



`They walked in silence through the precinct‚Äôs quiet hallway, the fluorescent lights casting pale reflections on the tiled floor. Outside, the evening sun was beginning to dip low, casting long shadows across the parking lot.`



`As they helped Anne into the back seat of the patrol car, Officer Davies paused. ‚ÄúAnne‚Ä¶ if there‚Äôs anything you ever remember, or need to tell us later, you can. But you don‚Äôt have to go through it again unless you want to.‚Äù`



`Anne looked up at him, her face weary but clearer than before. ‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù she whispered.`



`The car pulled away, its quiet hum fading into the distance as they drove her back to the hospital‚Äîback to safety, back to healing.`



`The lab was gone. The nightmare had been spoken aloud. And though the path ahead would be long, Anne had survived it. And now, others finally knew.`",1,1746808681.0,stories,0,1.0,False

Honestly, I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôm dating a narcissist, because he really doesn‚Äôt care how his actions affect our relationship. I have come to realize he has somehow made it to 36 years of age always getting away with being selfish without any real consequences. (SERIOUSLY, I don‚Äôt know how.) I‚Äôm doing my best to navigate my way out, but my God, it‚Äôs so difficult as we live together and work together. My mental state isn‚Äôt at its best right now. So I need to ask if others would find this frustrating as well. Or if I really do have control issues? 
It‚Äôs this group of ‚Äúfriends‚Äù, also coworkers. They are haters and shit starters and I would like to know what the healthy way of handling those type of people in a healthy relationship would look like. I don‚Äôt know what to think or feel anymore.
So these guys told my boyfriend that one morning two other coworkers were ‚Äúall over me‚Äù separately. One guy, we happened to be walking towards the security shack (only entrance) at the same time and had a typical morning conversation involving hating work and needing coffee. No touching whatsoever. The other saw me as he was exiting the building in his work truck. I had pulled over in the parking lot to grab my lunch bag out of my car before leaving in my work truck. He saw me and chose to stop to give me a hug while I was crossing the road to get back into my work truck. Later bf calls me and we talk for a good little while before he asks me kind of out of the blue if I‚Äôve been hugging people. Immediately I thought, oh dang, I didn‚Äôt tell him. So then I do and he goes off on me about having had this conversation before, how I‚Äôm such a hypocrite about breaking promises because here I am hugging people. The whole time I‚Äôm thinking I DIDN‚ÄôT DO ANYTHING. I did get mad and upset because I realized those guys had decided to ‚Äúbe boys‚Äù and push his buttons and this ding dong I‚Äôve been dating doesn‚Äôt have the balls to tell them to shut the hell up about me or to drop them as friends. 
I have asked him to establish boundaries with them before because we also work together, ya know? They could be on the phone all day bs‚Äôing while working- while on the phone they share pictures of other women, corn screenshots and instagram posts that pretty much equal to the same thing, to rate these women. And I told him that his friends clearly didn‚Äôt respect women, him, me, or our relationship, full well knowing that he got caught lying and cheating on me and that we were trying to ‚Äúwork on it‚Äù. I realize that I can‚Äôt control other people‚Äôs actions. But is it an overreaction on my part to hope my partner would actually drop the friends that don‚Äôt encourage growth in our relationship? Is that controlling of me? 

PS: I know I need to get back in therapy but honestly I‚Äôm so ashamed to admit all I‚Äôve allowed myself to be put through and how debilitating this has all been. I promise me I will though. ",1,1746808270.0,AmIOverreacting,8,1.0,False
1kimtl8,https://www.reddit.com/r/trustyconsumer/comments/1kimtl8/discover_if_lotfancy_bd25366_wrist_blood_pressure/,Discover if LotFancy BD25366 Wrist Blood Pressure Monitor Review Lives Up to Expectations,"Testing out the LotFancy BD25366 Talking Blood Pressure Monitor has been quite an engaging experience. With this compact device in daily use, I‚Äôve come to appreciate both its strengths and imperfections. It‚Äôs marketed as the go-to wrist blood pressure cuff for ease, accuracy, and convenience, particularly for home use. Featuring a voice broadcast system, a large LCD display, and memory options for two users, it seems tailored for accessibility. However, you know nothing‚Äôs ever perfect, and this product has its quirks, too.

**Design and Portability**

If there‚Äôs one thing to applaud here, it‚Äôs the sleek, lightweight design of this wrist monitor. Weighing just 8.6 ounces, it‚Äôs easy to toss it into its handy carrying case and take it anywhere. Whether traveling for work or heading to a weekend getaway, the compactness ensures there‚Äôs no extra bulk. Its adjustable cuff fits wrist circumferences ranging from 5.3 to 8.5 inches, accommodating most users comfortably. I also had a senior neighbor try it out, and he found the hook-and-loop fasteners straightforward to use. Onlookers might confuse it for a smartwatch (okay, not the Apple Watch crowd), given its unassuming profile. Definitely a plus for discreet health monitoring!  

**Ease of Use and Voice Broadcast**

Having no patience for overly complicated gadgets, I was relieved to find its one-button operation truly fuss-free. You press it, and it starts measuring‚Äîno extra manuals needed. What stood out most during testing was the voice broadcast function. The device speaks your systolic and diastolic pressures along with your pulse rate in a gentle English tone. For someone like my grandmother, who has poor eyesight (and probably insists OTT volumes are ‚Äòstill quiet‚Äô), the voice feedback was genuinely helpful. That said, for those who prefer their privacy or, let‚Äôs face it, quiet mornings, the lack of volume control can verge on annoying. Would I want everyone in the living room hearing my BP stats? Not really.

**Advantages**

- Lightweight and travel-friendly for daily portability.  
- Voice announcements make it ideal for the elderly or visually impaired.  
- Adjustable cuff that comfortably fits variably sized wrists.  

[Check LotFancy BD25366 price on Amazon.](https://thepressureexperts.com/link/b00q681a68/)

**Accuracy and Measurements**

While daily readings often feel consistent, this device demands a perfectly ideal environment to nail accurate results. CEO of quirks here‚Äîforget the right posture, accidentally move your wrist up or down during a measurement, and voil√†, numbers significantly fluctuate. I tested it early mornings after avoiding coffee or exercise (because caffeine withdrawals are fun), and I found readings reasonable. It‚Äôs advised to average three consecutive readings for more accuracy, a feature this monitor neatly offers. Precision enthusiasts, however, may prefer taking their doctor‚Äôs word over the device for hardcore monitoring.  

**Drawbacks**

- Accuracy drops if wrist position isn‚Äôt held steady.  
- Readings tend to vary in cooler temperatures or right after meals.  

**Key Features**

The functionality where it remembers up to 120 readings‚Äîper user, in separate profiles‚Äîis a lifesaver, especially for tracking trends. It splits memory for two users, 60 per person, complete with time and date stamps. Couples managing hypertension together, or that one pair of competitive siblings, could find this feature invaluable. These memory logs don‚Äôt just sit grudgingly on the machine; they‚Äôre essential for healthcare visits. Recording BP trends has never felt easier.

In a fast-paced environment, the large LCD display is another big thumbs up. The HD screen is crisp, well-lit, and easily legible even to visually impaired users. This came in handy when spotting symbols for low battery or positioning errors.

**Battery Life and Practicality**

Running on two AAA batteries, the product claims about two months of juice at three uses a day‚Äîwhich held up pretty well so far. I chucked in rechargeable batteries just to save cost. However, fair warning: there are no batteries included in the package, so you‚Äôll want to have extras on hand. It‚Äôs also a bit moody in extreme environments‚Äîreadings shifted slightly when placed in overly chilly rooms during winter testing. An odd quirk for such a practical device.

**Competing Products**

When comparing this blood pressure monitor to Omron's higher-end wrist monitors, some clear distinctions emerge. The Omron models, often a go-to for professionals, tend to offer more consistent accuracy and more advanced app integrations for data sharing. However, Omron‚Äôs premium features come at a steeper price point. This device, while simpler, fills a sweet spot for casual daily monitoring without dragging in the tech-heavy extras. For portability dedicated to the elderly or basic users, the LotFancy monitor serves its purpose decently while Omron focuses on long-term data precision systems.

**Value for Money**

Considering its simplicity and accessibility, the Bang for the Buck here feels reasonable. Sure, you‚Äôre foregoing high-grade clinical accuracy, but for basic home use, it nails the essentials. The additional memory features and voice guidance feel worth the trade-off if used by older adults or those wanting an easy-to-follow gadget. It falls into an affordable quality-driven bracket‚Äîa factor that might convince hesitant buyers.

1kimtkm,https://www.reddit.com/r/WashingMachineReviews/comments/1kimtkm/could_tide_pods_laundry_detergent_pacs_be_the/,Could Tide PODS Laundry Detergent Pacs Be The Ultimate Cleaning Solution? Review Inside,"The **Tide 80367594 PODS Laundry Detergent Pacs, 3-in-1 Stain Remover, Odor Fighter, Color Protector** became a staple in my home after some serious laundry mishaps. Between the endless soda spills on my kids' shirts and the ever-persistent gym odors on my workout clothes, my washing machine faces daily battles. I decided to try these detergent pacs to see if the hype lived up to reality, and here's how it went.

**Impressive Design and User-Friendly Nature**  
The first thing that struck me about these detergent pods was their compact yet effective design. They come pre-measured, which is a lifesaver for someone like me who often eyeballs the amount of liquid detergent (and usually gets it wrong). Each little pac contains a trifecta of cleaning power: a stain remover, an odor fighter, and a color protector. Dropping one or two into the drum felt oddly satisfying. Plus, they dissolve completely, even in cold water, so I didn‚Äôt have to deal with residue sticking to my clothes‚Äîa past nightmare with powdered detergents.

[Check Tide 80367594 price on Amazon.](https://mobilewasher.com/p/b0bjmv9bxj/)

**Cleaning Power That Surprised Me**  
These pods claim to have three times the cleaning power of leading bargain liquid detergents, and I can't argue with that. My son‚Äôs ketchup-stained school uniform came out spotless after one wash, and my husband's gym towels finally smelled clean instead of faintly sweaty. Even heavily soiled loads responded well, though I used an extra pod just to be safe. Tide PODS worked wonders on older stains too, though they weren‚Äôt entirely magic; a coffee mark on my favorite blouse needed an additional go in the wash.

**Positives**  
- Easy to use, just toss and go.  
- Cleans tough stains and freshens effectively.  
- Dissolves fully, even in cold water.  

**Convenient Packaging and Scent**  
The Spring Meadow scent is noticeable but not overpowering. It left my linens smelling fresh without screaming ""artificial."" The packaging, on the other hand, needs mentioning. Procter & Gamble nailed it with a child-safe container‚Äîa must-have when you‚Äôve got curious toddlers running around. The container is sturdy, and I didn't have to worry about spills or mishandling. That said, the packaging isn‚Äôt exactly compact. It occupies more cabinet space than a standard detergent bottle.

**Areas for Improvement**  
- The pods are pricier compared to regular liquid detergents.  
- Not ideal for handwashing or smaller sink loads.  
- Requires an additional pod for heavily soiled items.  

**Competing Products I‚Äôve Considered**  
I‚Äôve tried other branded detergent pacs like Gain Flings and Arm & Hammer packs in the past, but Tide beats them in overall stain-lifting power and long-lasting scent. Gain focuses heavily on scent, which I sometimes find cloying, and Arm & Hammer does well with gentle cleaning but doesn‚Äôt cut through tough dirt as effectively as Tide. However, both competitors are better priced, making them a reasonable alternative for those on a tight budget.

**Value for Money**  
This is where opinions may vary depending on how much laundry you do and how picky you are about stain removal or scent. While these pods are undeniably effective in treating stubborn grime, they cost more per load than liquid detergents or bargain detergent options. Still, if you‚Äôre like me and prioritize clean-smelling, vibrant clothes, the price feels justified‚Äîit‚Äôs like outsourcing your stain worries!

Review inside!,"Testing the **WONDERFOLD X4 Push & Pull Stroller Wagon (Model X4-BLK)** has been an interesting experience. With its sleek design and versatile functionality, it's clear this stroller wagon was made with practicality and style in mind. It's not every day you come across a wagon that holds up to four little passengers, while also boasting features like a foldable frame, adjustable handles, and a UV-protection canopy. I've spent considerable time pushing, pulling, folding, and loading this stroller wagon, and though there‚Äôs much to love about it, there are certain details worth noting.

**Design and Build Quality**

What stands out immediately is the sturdy construction of this wagon. Its alloy steel frame feels robust yet surprisingly lightweight when on the go. With dimensions of 42.52""D x 29.92""W x 42.91""H, it's sizeable enough for four children while being compact enough when folded for easy storage. Having used it in crowded parks and narrow sidewalks, I found the size to strike a decent balance between being spacious and manageable. I also appreciate the stealth black color‚Äîit‚Äôs stylish and hides dirt better than you‚Äôd expect after a day out with toddlers.

Adding to the appeal are the polyurethane wheels, which are designed to handle a variety of terrains. From suburban streets to sandy beaches, the tires rolled with ease in most cases, although they occasionally struggled with extremely loose or uneven sand patches. Overall, this wagon feels durable enough to take on multiple adventures with a growing family.

**Features and Functionality**

Exploring the features of this stroller wagon has been a bit like unwrapping a gift that keeps on giving. The **five-point adjustable safety harnesses** across all four seats are a lifesaver when hauling kids around. They provide crucial safety, keeping even the squirmiest toddlers securely in place. My niece tested the harness by attempting her signature escape move (she‚Äôs a pro at this), and it withstood her efforts like a champ.

The **adjustable push handle and telescopic pull handle** work well depending on your preference for pushing or pulling. I love the spring bounce technology on the pull handle‚Äîit keeps the handle elevated and prevents it from hitting the ground, even if you accidentally let go. However, I did notice that adjusting the push handle felt slightly stiff initially, though it loosened up over time.

Something I didn‚Äôt expect to appreciate so much was the **removable sun canopy**. On sunny days, the UV-protective material provided ample shaded coverage for the kids, though taller children might still need sunscreen for extra protection. The adjustable canopy rods were easy to height-adjust, allowing for more flexibility depending on the size of your little riders.

Need to stop for a quick coffee? The **one-step foot brake** is simple yet effective, holding the wagon securely in place. I didn‚Äôt realize how much I'd use this feature until navigating a hilly park. A quick nudge with my foot gave me peace of mind while making sure the wagon stayed put.

**Key Benefits**

- Extremely spacious, comfortably seating up to four children.  
- Adjustable handles cater to pushers and pullers of all heights.  
- The foldability is perfect for quick storage or transporting.  
- Durable wheels perform exceptionally well on a variety of terrains.  
- Safety features, such as five-point harnesses and reflective strips, enhance peace of mind.

**Areas of Concern**

While testing this wagon, there were a few quibbles that stood out. These aren‚Äôt deal-breakers for me, but they're worth mentioning nonetheless.

- The weight of the wagon itself, at 45.6 pounds, can make it challenging to lift into a car or carry up stairs.  
- Adjusting the push handle was stiff initially and felt like it required more effort than it should.  
- Although the canopy provides shade, taller kids remain partially exposed to sunlight.  

**Competing Products**

In a crowded market of stroller wagons, the Wonderfold X4 competes against some heavy hitters like the Keenz 7S and the Evenflo Pivot Xplore. While the Keenz offers lightweight portability and additional storage pockets, it struggles compared to the rugged terrain capabilities of the Wonderfold. The Evenflo Pivot Xplore has slightly better maneuverability due to its compact size, but it cannot match the seating capacity of the four-seater Wonderfold.

Where the Wonderfold shines is sheer utility. It carries more, handles the bumpy terrain admirably, and comes outfitted with an adjustable canopy‚Äîa feature some competitors lack. However, it does lose out on weight; other options like the Keenz are noticeably lighter and easier to carry when folded.

**Cost Efficiency**

Considering everything packed into the Wonderfold stroller wagon, I‚Äôd say it's a worthy investment, particularly for families with multiple young children or those who frequently travel. Its durability, functionality, and safety-centric design make it stand out over cheaper, less-equipped models. Yes, it‚Äôs slightly on the heavier side, but the value far outweighs this minor inconvenience.

Even if the price point is higher than some budget wagons, it delivers excellent cost efficiency. With proper care, this may well be a long-term solution for your family‚Äôs strolls, beach trips, and park outings.

1kimtcb,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyGearReviews/comments/1kimtcb/find_out_why_chicco_keyfit_caddy_stroller_review/,Find Out Why Chicco KeyFit Caddy Stroller Review Highlights Convenience and Smooth Travel,"The Chicco 06079648950070 KeyFit Caddy Frame Stroller has been part of my daily routine for a couple of weeks now, so I‚Äôve had plenty of time to put it through the wringer. As someone who constantly juggles errands, baby gear, and, let‚Äôs face it, my sanity, this stroller seemed like it could make life easier. Spoiler alert: it lives up to most of its promises, but there are a few quirks to keep in mind.

**Sleek and Lightweight Design**  
The ultra-lightweight frame is an absolute game changer. At just 11.6 pounds, moving this stroller around doesn‚Äôt feel like wrestling a piece of gym equipment. Its slim profile glides through narrow doors or packed store aisles with ease. I live in a top-floor apartment, so hauling it up and down stairs isn‚Äôt a nightmare, which is a huge bonus. The black aluminum frame looks modern and chic, but it does seem prone to picking up smudges‚Äîminor, but worth mentioning for the neat freaks among us.

**Ease of Use**  
The click-in car seat attachment system is the star of the show here. It accepts all Chicco infant car seats like a dream, snapping in with a gratifying ‚Äúclick‚Äù that ensures everything is locked in place. When I‚Äôm rushing to get the baby secured after grocery shopping, this feature saves me a lot of fumbling around. The one-hand compact fold? It‚Äôs as convenient as it sounds. The whole thing folds down into a manageable size (35 x 20 x 41 inches) and even stands upright on its own. Truly, a standing fold deserves applause.  

[Check Chicco 06079648950070 KeyFit Caddy Frame Stroller price on Amazon.](https://babycareshop.com/p/b08pvxsh5n/)  

**Superior Comfort for Parents**  
One feature I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd care much about but now adore is the ergonomic push handle. With four adjustable height positions, it caters nicely to both me and my much-taller partner. My back no longer feels strained during longer stroller jaunts, and that‚Äôs a win for me. The built-in parent tray is another thoughtful touch. With two cup holders and a covered compartment, my essentials like keys, phone, and iced coffee stay secure. Bonus: the tray feels durable enough that I don‚Äôt worry about it cracking under pressure.

**Smooth Rides All Around**  
The all-wheel suspension system genuinely surprised me with how well it handles uneven sidewalks and small bumps. The front swivel wheels keep navigation effortless even in tight spaces, while the toe-tap rear brakes feel solid underfoot. I tested it on gravel paths during a park visit, and while it didn‚Äôt perform like an all-terrain stroller, it held up well for a compact city-friendly model. My kiddo stayed snug without getting jostled, and I didn‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôd lost control.

**Storage That Actually Works**  
If you‚Äôre like me, you‚Äôve probably wrestled with strollers boasting ‚Äúample storage‚Äù only to find the basket is tiny or hard to access. Not the case here. The zipper-expandable storage basket is genuinely large enough to fit both my diaper bag and a couple of shopping bags. Accessing it from either the front or the rear makes loading a breeze. It‚Äôs these little design touches that feel well thought out and practical.  

**Merits**  
- Feather-light and easy to carry, perfect for urban living.  
- Adjustable handle height adds comfort for parents of all sizes.  
- Quick one-hand folding stands independently for tight storage spaces.  

**Negatives**  
- Black aluminum frame shows smudges easily.  
- Designed mostly for Chicco car seats, limiting compatibility options for parents using other brands.  

**Product Comparisons**  
While Chicco promotes this stroller as an ideal companion for its own infant car seats, I couldn‚Äôt resist comparing it against alternatives like the Baby Trend Snap-N-Go or the Graco SnugRider Elite. The Snap-N-Go is similarly lightweight and accommodates multiple car seat brands (a clear advantage), but its handling isn‚Äôt as smooth, and its storage feels clunky. The SnugRider Elite offers similar parent comfort features like a tray, but it‚Äôs heavier. What sets this Chicco stroller apart is its balance of usability, design, and ride smoothness, though the brand-exclusive pairing might be a dealbreaker for some.  

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
Given the focus on convenience and thoughtful features, it‚Äôs refreshing to find this stroller priced reasonably compared to premium stroller-carrier combos. Considering its durable build and functional details, I‚Äôd argue it delivers solid quality for the investment. If you are already a Chicco infant car seat owner, it‚Äôs practically a no-brainer.

1kimsya,https://www.reddit.com/r/wimbledon/comments/1kimsya/my_experience_camping_for_at_wimbledon_2024/,My experience camping for at Wimbledon 2024,"My husband and I camped for day 1 of Wimbledon last year. I found this sub so helpful in telling us what to expect and prepare, so I wanted to return the favour by sharing our experience. It's a bit long but I hope it will be helpful! 

**8:45PM Joining the Queue**

Our original plan was to join the queue around midnight, but I found a spreadsheet someone shared here that listed the times people joined the queue previous year and their ticket number (I‚Äôve lost the link to this now, but if someone has it, please share!), and based on that we decided to show up earlier to make sure we could get at least court 2 tickets.

It was easy to find the end of the queue in the park by the volunteer staff. Our ticket numbers were **1203** and **1204**. There are clean bathroom facilities and nearby shops where you can get takeaway food, but we also brought our own snacks and wine.

We flew from NY so did not have a lot of equipment: small tent we bought from Amazon that fit into our carry on luggage, and the blankets we took from our flights. Some people came with a whole camping set up with chairs, others just with simple sleeping bags, one guy we met in line the next day brought absolutely nothing. Our set up was barebones but fine for just a night, and we were blessed with good weather. 

The evening went by pretty quickly because we had a bunch of thing to do like setting up the tent, eating snacks, polishing off a bottle of wine, washing up, etc. I fell asleep around 11PM.

**5:30AM Wake up / pack up**

Around this time people started getting up and packing up their things. There are luggage check areas but the lines were very long and they recommended we wait to use the luggage storage closer to the grounds, so we held on to our things for a little while longer.

There were a bunch of food trucks where you could get coffee and food, but the lines were extremely long so I recommend either going out of the park (there was a coffee shop \~5 min walk away) or bringing your own breakfast.

**7:00AM-ish Arranging into queues**

The staff came around to arrange people into queues to prepare for entry. There‚Äôs not a lot to do at this point so you‚Äôre just hanging around chatting with your neighbours, waiting for your turn to move up in the queue. Everyone was super friendly, and all around good vibes because people are just happy to be there. 

**8:30AM Moving along the queue**

The queue moved into a gated area and staff came around with wristbands for anyone who wanted purchase center/court 1/court 2 tickets. Since there were over 1200 people ahead of us, only court 2 was left by the time they got to us.

There was another luggage check along this route so we deposited our stuff there. 

**9:37AM Ticket purchase**

The queue ended at the ticketing booths. We paid ‚Ç§50 each for our court 2 tickets. We did not specify what seats we wanted but got very good ones. In the kiosk next to us the agent was more proactive, showing a map of available seats, discussing the direction of the sun, etc.

At this point the grounds were not open yet so we were put into a waiting area, and then as we got closer to the gates opening at 10AM, people started queueing again.

**10:09AM Entered the grounds!**

We stayed until the grounds closed at 9PM. There was a bit of a traffic jam to get out due to the large number of people and a bit of a long wait for a ride share, but all in all, we had an amazing time!

My main tip would be to bring your own food and beverage if you're camping, as well as your allotted bottle of wine for watching the matches. And bring a hat because you will be sitting out in the sun for several hours the morning!",11,1746808230.0,wimbledon,1,0.93,False

1kimsml,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kimsml,Help me with the size and colour of the rug that will suit my living room,"Hi people

We bought a new home recently and are trying to setup the living room. We underestimated the feel of the couch's size with respect to the living room. We have a dining table behind the couch and thus have little space left in front of it. We feel if we go wrong with the rug, the space will start looking too small and if the colour does not work with the gray sofa, the place will look too corporate and cold.

Could you folks advise us on what size of rug to pick? We read that both the foot of the sofa and the TV unit should be over the rug. That would bring us to about a minimum of 170 cm rug. But we feel it will feel too large. The space between the sofa leg and the wall is about 210 cm. The width of the sofa is about 270 cm. That is a 75inch TV to help scale and a 50cm coushion on the ground.
The tv unit width 200cm by 40cm.

Also do you folks think we will have space left for a small coffee table?

Thankyou for all the help! We would also love your advise on what more we can do on the TV wall to make the space warm? We are thinking to add some paintings and personal photos on the wall. Both me and my partner got our own space for the first time in our life so have no idea how to decorate the place.",2,1746808207.0,DesignMyRoom,2,1.0,False

(ART IS NOT BY ME, art is by ""youling225"" on danbooru)


Morgan carefully made her way through the crowded boulevard, avoiding fallen petals and discarded goods. Behind her, following with an equally delicate footing, was IfTeaz.

IfTeaz, her eye suddenly drawn to a remarkably clear diamond, beckoned her madam over with a small wave.

The remarkably diamond was equally expensive. Morgan had never seen such a price. 

However, as she debated over her funds, pay, and possible usage of such a diamond, an eccentrically dressed young man stepped forward. Without a word, he peered across the various jewels and gems, his limpid eyes landing on the diamond. Upon seeing such a beautiful gem, he raised an eyebrow and gave a glance to Morgan and Ifteaz, quietly inquiring them. He chuckled and deliberately stepped back, rubbing his chin with a comical energy. 

Still silent, he beckoned the teller over and casually purchased the diamond.

Then, once that was done, he turned around to leave. But, as he passed by Morgan and Ifteaz, he elegantly slipped it into Morgan's hand.

*Such an odd man.*

...

This young man, carrying about a rather small object on himself, told those who asked he was a traveling merchant.

He was dressed in a manner that attempted to be ""normal, yet something about the colors...no, the buttons? Perhaps it was the ""person"" who wore them, the person who seemed to be only a figment in reality, a paint blot of extraordinary color that wasn't easy to spot, yet when seen stood out sorely.

Perhaps.

His eyes were clear. Beyond clear, in fact. They reflected everything like a mirror. He never simply ""looked"" at anything, but instead he seemed to deeply understand whatever he put his attention to.

An extraordinary ""man"", one with a sense of vast knowledge, yet would readily act like an layman to guide a child's question's naturally. 

He is someone who freely spends for others without question. He is someone who, although without saying it, has served with an investigation association for a short amount of time, and it deeply influences his manners and speech. He is a person who is invisible to everyone until he makes himself known.

He is a ""person"" who tries to be better, and who tries to look forward to tomorrow. He is a ""person"" who can dream like a child, yet understands his dreams are foolish. 

... 

Moving through the crowd, the odd young man slipped by and by, without ever being noticed once. Each step seeming to cause almost invisible ripples in reality. 

The world revolved daily, and he made sure it did. Every day, he would come to the city square to admire the sky. At night, he would busy himself to making strange but delightful lanterns and handing them out to passerbys, all the while staring at the moon.

Everywhere he went, he would also bring his Tarot Cards, giving his card reading at a small price of two cents. 

In fact, this young man had become somewhat notorious, as an urban legend in the City That Worships The Diamond!

People said that, ""A man who's never there but appears when he pleases, handing out all sorts of things. He is distant and weird, but all to kind and passionate! He can tell your fate before you even ask for a card reading! It is like he knows everyone as a close friend, as a parent, as a work colleague."" 

...

After a usual day of endless walking, the young man stood alone, peering down at a well. He stared at his reflection, and he could see it shifting, changing to GreenToastStone, but the moment it changed too far, it swirled back to himself. 

He shook his head, telling himself over and over...

*I am an inventor. I am a Fortune Teller.*

 *I am the child that dreams of chocolate, and I eagerly await my parent. I cut through the crowd, as I cannot wait to return home and see my child. I am the old butler who helps the lady. I extend my hand, letting an old butler assist me out of my carriage. I eye the new suit with interest, as she tells me how dashing I would be in it. I speak to my lover, telling him he should buy himself a new suit...*

*I am all of these people.*

*I am Fate. I am infinite. I am finite. I am cruel. I am kind. I am ""Sieben."" I am not ""Sieben."" I am a contradiction. I will try to be ""Sieben."" I am not ""GreenToastStone."" There is a difference. There is a difference. There is a difference...*

The water remained still. 

The world kept moving.

...

As the day ended, casting a beautiful light across the city, Sieben stepped up, balancing precariously from the top of a roof. Behind him, a flock of doves flew by. 

He had been lending his hand to all, without question. If they needed him, he would appear, with a smile and a wink. He would play the idiot in the theater if needed! He would be the one customer to that nearly forgotten coffee shop! He would be a someone when somebody needed him to be a someone. He strived to be a kind and understanding ""Fate.""

And yet. He felt hollow from it.

He felt hollow from all of it, the world, the Seas, the very ideas that sprung from a mind he wasn't sure was his own.

Whenever he saw people passing by, he could only see their ""Fate."" He could not see how they could enjoy themselves so plainly anymore. 

And yet he knew it was meaningless to do such things. All he could do was be cold, and be heartless, writing down every detail of every life like some twisted playwright.

Yet, he could never bring himself to do so. In fact, it was if there were two minds in his own, one of which was ""Fate,"" and one of which was ""Sieben."" But, the line always blurred, and the two became one at times, so closely that they seemed to be perfectly made for each other.

GreenToastStone had vanished once Sieben had boarded that train and eaten that apple. He remembered clearly, how GreenToastStone was indebted to him, allowing Fate to walk across the world in a body. Since then, GreenToastStone's presence within his mind had faded rather quickly...

In the end, if he was truly ""Sieben"" anymore, or if he was completely ""Fate"", and, inherently, GreenToastStone, he did not know at all. Were these thoughts his? Or were they GreenToastStone's, being influenced by ""Sieben""? Was he actually GreenToastStone, and because of fusing with Sieben's memories, he had changed? 

Now, Sieben realized just how terrible it was. He could not be truly kind, yet he could not be cold. Every emotion felt false to him. Every smile, either be it exaggerated, bright, or subtle, was like a mask he wore. All there was, deep down within him, was an emptiness: a sheer lack of self. Fate had no particular meaning, only as a driving force of all entities. It was everything and nothing, the most unpredictable, gentle, cruel thing. 

Why was he even living amongst people? He noted it was almost an insult to these people. He was their source of troubles, their despair. He read Cards, giving small hints to his customers on how their lives would go, but it was never enough. How he wished to apologize to the hungry, to the insane, to those who had good hearts but had no where to go.

He wanted to climb up on the center clock of the city square, yelling out to all how they would suffer, rise and fall in fortune, how they would love and be heartbroken! How he would be called a madman. 

Sieben shook his head, and, as he sighed, sat up, propping his chin his hand. He watched as the doves flew farther and farther away from him, thinking.

*If I can write every good man a good fate, and a bad man an equally terrible fate, that would be rather odd. But, I cannot be judge of that. I could become almost tyrannical, writing down every detail in every person's life. I know I cannot do that though. The Self and the notion of Destiny also govern mankind,*

*The Self which I long for is taken for granted by many. In fact, even as someone who has become Fate, I do not understand Self. And now I cannot even understand myself and all of my thoughts! ""GreenToastStone"", ""Sieben"". I do not know who I am. All I can guess is that I am Fate, and both have become one, yet are distinctly different all at once! What a confusing dilemma.*

He returned to thinking about people. Frankly, he had nothing else to think about. If he thought about the Self, he would only realize how destroyed he was. If he thought of Destiny, he would realize he had no more Destiny. It made him feel...nothing. It strangely didn't cause him distress nor confusion. Only an empty sense of existing, a complete lack of care and empathy even for himself! 

It scared him! He wanted to savor everything in this new, reconstructed world, but all he simply did was become dull and like a monolith. He put on a performance that slowly was turning into an anchor to ""living"".

*Every smile I see brings me a faint feeling that isn't joy, but it isn't nothing either.*

*All I can do is watch.*

He was about to repeat that internal monologue on how he was one and all, the child, the father, everyone. 

But he stopped. As he watched the city bustle beneath and shift itself into night life, the corners of his lips turned upwards slightly. 

*I think I like watching people live. Not them fighting against the impossible, struggling against the unknown. No. i like watching people live with the little things.*

*In the end, all I can do is gaze at humanity as I drift away from it second by second,*

*In a world of mysteries and danger, the most mysterious thing of all is mankind.*

With that, Sieben chuckled softly. Fireworks shot up in the rapidly darkened sky, exploding into colors of beauty. The wind softly moved, and in the distance, chimes sounded. 

*It's all worth it, anyway. Everyone is alive. And that's enough for me.*

Sweet Paradise Ice Cream isn‚Äôt just any typical ice cream truck, it's a moving feast, bringing the bold and bright flavors of Mexican street food to neighborhoods across Reno. 

For Diana and Santiago, the owners, it's a business built on flavor and passion for sharing their food culture.¬†

Their journey began 12 years ago when they left Puebla, Mexico, at just 20 years old, hoping for a fresh start in Reno. Dreams of opening a restaurant quickly ran into barriers as landlords didn‚Äôt want to rent to two young immigrants. But instead of giving up, they looked for another way. At 23, they invested in a food truck, and that decision changed everything.¬†

The timing worked. In 2022, while the pandemic forced many businesses to close, Sweet Paradise hit the streets.¬†

‚ÄúWe prefer the food truck and going around being able to see everyone and the community. At first we wanted a restaurant but now we see more in a food truck than having an actual location,‚Äù said Diana.¬†¬†

Sure, they serve ice cream but their menu goes beyond that. It‚Äôs a full lineup of antojitos mexicanos: Buldak noodles loaded with elote and Hot Cheetos, creamy elote served in a cup or on the cob, Mangonadas bursting with chamoy, and refreshing aguas frescas in flavors like cucumber, watermelon, and horchata. It‚Äôs street food, comfort food and sweet treats all rolled into one.¬†

‚ÄúWe wanted to do more,‚Äù Diana says. ‚ÄúPeople see the truck and think it's just desserts, but they don't know what they‚Äôre missing.‚Äù¬†

For them, it's more than food, it's about connection. They‚Äôve become a familiar sight across Reno, and their menu continues to grow. They welcome diversity and new faces to come give it a try. Of Course they sell ice cream and popsicles but right now, they‚Äôre serving their version of the viral Dubai-style chocolate covered strawberries, made with premium ingredients straight from Los Angeles. Just one example of how they keep up with trends.¬†

The key to Sweet Paradise success is their constant movement. Every day is a new route and some mornings you can find them parked outside office buildings, in Spanish Springs or Sparks. Wherever they are, their instagram (@sweetparadiseicecream) keeps followers updated, making it easy for customers to find them.

Their hustle hasn‚Äôt gone unnoticed. What started as a way to make a living has become a community staple, a place where families stop by for a quick treat and friends gather for something new. 

Later this year they‚Äôre planning to launch a second truck, a new venture that will bring churros, flan, and other sweet desserts to their menu.¬†  
‚ÄúThis is a truck for summer antojitos,‚Äù says Diana. ‚ÄúOur other truck is more for antojitos in the cold like coffee, hot chocolate, flan, churros and more.‚Äù

For Diana and Santiago, Sweet Paradise is a family story. It‚Äôs proof that good food and good people will always find each other. For anyone who hasn‚Äôt tried them yet, there‚Äôs a simple invitation: follow them on instagram, track them down, and see what you have been missing.¬†

1kimojn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Slime/comments/1kimojn/slime_retriever_and_amma_slimes_review/,Slime Retriever and Amma Slimes Review,"Finally got to try Slime Retriever and a couple of textures I've been wanting from Amma as well. Lots to review so I'll get right into it:

**Slime Retriever**

> Slime Name: Dreaming of Summer

* Texture: White Glue Slay Star Bead x Block Bead Crunch

* Scent: Cactus Blossom, Beach linen, Banana Boat sunscreen

* Thoughts: Smells amaziiiing first off. So fresh and summery, and the strength level is not too strong at all. There was a fair warning this guy was super packed and boy was that right on. It is so packed in fact that this one imo is more of a fold and crunch type texture. Nothing is wrong with that type or the base to be clear! That many beads naturally makes it so you're unable to really stretch it is all. Kinda like that one strawberry jigsaw puzzle block bead slime Rodem put out a couple months ago. Personally I might add some clear glue base to it to get some stretch cause I wanna stretch it so badddd, but if you prefer something to just fold and crunch this would work well imo. There was blue staining as well, but I don't mind that since it washes right off.

Tldr: Super cronchy and base is silky smooth with an amazing scent, definitely a fold and crunch slime rather than a stretching one. Has staining but washes off very easily.

> Slime Name: Daydreaming of Flower Fields

* Texture: Cg Sequin bomb (50/50 packed)

* Scent: True lilac, plumeria, japanese cherry blossom

* Thoughts: Such a thick clear! Was on the much slower stretch side for me when I first played but it has since loosened a tad so I assume it was OA at first. Not that I mind, it's still nice and thick with a bit of resistance. Smells so fresh and flowery, and makes amazing bubble pops. No tack either! I find myself reaching for this one a lot.

Tldr: No tack, thick and with a slower stretch. Makes lots of bubble pops and smells like a pleasant flower bouquet.

> Slime Name: Waking up to the Sound of Morning Doves

* Texture: Marshmallow x Silica

* Scent: Baltic Dew, Juicy sweet pear, coffee shop

* Thoughts: Loveee the scent on this. You really can smell each note. This was my first time trying a scent blend like this and I am happy I did cause it comes together real nice. Coffee is strongest, but there is this hint of dewy sweetness from the other two that just play so well together. The texture was also new to me as well. I was told that marshmallow is a snow butter variant and I can see why! This one has a tonnnn of resistance and I suspect it may at least be partly due to being OA but since I like resistance that isn't a downside to me. Just gotta be careful you don't rip it from pulling fast. It takes more elbow grease to fluff up as a result but I love the final result. The silica stayed in perfectly as well, even when all fluffed, which I was really surprised about, and I liked how much silica there was too. A surprising bit of crunch!

Tldr: A unique and yummy scent blend, paired with a high resistance (possibly OA) base that turns nice and fluffy with some arm work, plus a pleasant extra bit of crunch from the silica. Really enjoyed it!

> Slime Name: Puddle Hoppin'

* Texture: Slay x Fishbowl topper

* Scent: Rain water, Rain, Honeydew melon

* Thoughts: Smell is fresh and light and so relaxing. I love rain scents so no surprise there. Texture is I daresay one of my new fav slays. It's again got a nice bit of resistance (dunno if OA or not but idm either way), and it fluffs like CRAZY. It gets so huge and cushy and is perfect for just squeezing the life out of. It reminds me a lot of SlimeSweetPea's meringue I got, and I love that so, this is definitely up there for me. Fishbowl beads did fall out but it's whatever. Easy to set aside since there aren't many.

Tldr: Fresh smell and amazing inflation; resistant and fun to squeeze. A new fav slay I think!

> Slime Name: ??? (Bonus/Freebie)

* Texture: White Glue Multifloam (w/ perlite or bingsu too?)

* Scent: ??? (Green-y with some kind of sweet note?)

* Thoughts: Smells really interesting. It reminds me of fresh greens, and the fimos are vegetables, so given the theme of the nostalgia restock maybe it's supposed to be garden scented? I love that sorta scent but the one thing I'm not jiving with is this sweet note at the end I'm picking up. Prolly just my nose not processing the scent oil properly. While it may not be a top fav scent combo the texture is amazing! It's stretchy, full of pops and crunches from all the add-ins, and I got some inflation out of it. It's got some nice structure and isn't sploopy at all, real good floam x whatever those other add-ins I feel in there.

Tldr: May not be my fav scent but more than makes up for it with a really poppy and crunchy white glue texture!

This was my first order from Slime Retriever and I'm glad I finally got to try them cause I really enjoyed what I got! Underrated shop for sure imo. Definitely gonna try and grab some Hello Kitty ones next restock so I can try maybe a jelly or butter x pony bead, and you should too!


**Amma Slimes**

> Slime Name: No Rain No Flowers

* Texture: Kinetic Cloud

* Scent: Fresh grass, basil, sage, and mint

* Thoughts: Smells very light and fresh. I get the grass the most with hints of the other three notes peeking through in a nice blend. This was very fun to squish and did remind me of like a kinetic sand dough in that sense, but I was having trouble with stretching it out to drizzle. Rather than stay in one long waterfall to do a drizzle, it kept wanting to clump and crumble after a couple pulls. I think it did get a bit better as I played and warmed it up but I still found it a bit hard to get a drizzle going on it. I don't play with clouds much so that could be affecting things here too so take that with salt. Still a nice slime for squishing and stuff but either I need to work on my drizzling technique or this slime is a tad difficult to drizzle. Zero tack or residue though!

Tldr: Smells great and good squishes but had some trouble with drizzling it (bit of clumping and crumbling). Very good for squishing on the couch though.

> Slime Name: Cucumber Melon Frost

* Texture: Icee

* Scent: Cucumber melon

* Thoughts: Once again a very light scent but also refreshing. It's a classic cucumber melon scent, you can't go wrong. I've been wanting an icee from Amma for a while and as expected it didn't disappoint. It was on the drier side I think as opposed to a wetter icee (I like both types based on my mood), and had zero residue. It had some nice resistance to the pulls too that stayed consistent throughout, and it felt so smooth. Fluffed up pretty nicely and got nice and frothy to make some great sizzles. Really felt like shaving cream to me, and it was so soothing to squish it down. Really stays inflated though; a week later and it has barely deflated!

Tldr: Zero residue, nice resistance, frothy, and sizzly. Probably one of my favorite if not my top favorite icee. 

> Slime Name: Dino Crunch

* Texture: Lava Rock

* Scent: Watermelon candy

* Thoughts: Smells soo yummy! Reminds me of a jolly rancher. Not overpowering at all, just a nice fruity candy scent. This slime is honestly my fav lava rock right now it is sooo good. Good resistance on the base, packed like 3/4 with small-sized lava rocks that make tons of crunches, and it makes lots of good pops. Not much tack unless you inflate it a lot like I did, which also caused a rock to fall out but only the one. Charm is also stinkin adorable. Honestly not much else to say, it's just perfect to me!

Tldr: Packed, crunchy, good resistance with minimal tack, yummy smell -- honestly it has it all. It's my perfect lava rock slime. Enough that if I could I would get a backup cause I love it so much. 

Honestly I don't see Amma talked a lot on here so she feels a bit underrated too, which is a shame! Do check her out if you want a good icee, jelly, lava rock, or tng (my fav textures from her). She's doing a weekly 50 dollar gift card giveaway too now.",3,1746807926.0,Slime,0,1.0,False

Years ago as you see Houseparty was shown on Southern TV ( Southern England) and latterly it never had a theme tune, but IT DID in the 70s but they dropped it and just had minimal credits and everywhere I've looked nobody mentions the end music. My sister and I would hum it when my sister in law came for a chat.  In the 80s it was just a doorbell and fade into chat,  then fade chat out at the end. It was recorded. A group of women chatting over tea and cake or coffee. They'd discuss recipes, finds at the jumble sale etc. That's all beside the point. I'm after what the theme was. Google advises there wasn't one. AI can be wrong. I watched it and know it had a theme so there!.  I usually only caught it if was off sick etc as should be at school. But by late 70s I wasn't interested anyway. I think my gran would watch it. My mum liked the cooking bits but she was normally busy being a mum, and in the 70s she was working as well so it was Gran who was there to sit with us and watch it. So this is for English people over 60, who can remember it? ",1,1746807921.0,TVThemeSongs,0,1.0,False

In Nov of 2024, I had 2 very minor cavities filled in my very rear molars. I was not experiencing any issues with them, filled in precaution. 

3 weeks later, my right 1st molar devloped extreme sensitivity. I wouldnt call it insidious, but it was very rapid over the course of 24 hours. I was eating soft rice when I first felt biting down feel weird. The next morning, my hot coffee hitting that tooth made me spit it out. 

It persisted for 3 days so I made an appt with the first dentist who could see me locally (my primary was fully booked and I was going on a trip the next week). At this point I can describe my symptoms as:

* When biting down hard, no pain, but I feel a ""suction"" like feeling when releasing my bite
* moderate to severe cold/hot sensitivity
* No pain at any time (ie throbbing)

She took a 3D xray and standard ones. She blew air onto it, she used a bite stick, even hit it a few times with a metal tool just to be sure. xrays were fully negative. She chalked it up to me clenching my teeth at night ( My job has become very stressful). I do sometimes catch myself clenching in my day to day. (my current doc today says I have no signs of grinding)

Fast forward to my routine appt today. I would say I have the same types of symptoms, but the discomfort is spotty on a day to day basis and I would describe any sensitivity as minimal to mild. Like today biting down and releasing elicits no sensation, but yesterday afternoon it did. 

Doc took xrays again and went though the same tests. He can also find nothing. He said that if I didnt tell him something was off, based on my xrays and exam, he wouldnt have known. He says the tooth ""cold"" be cracked, but it wold be impossible to see without breaking eggs to make an omlete as he described. He also said I could have traumatized my tooth on something, but what I was eating at the time and that day, there was no acute event I can recall.

Anyone have an idea what is going on?

Welcome back hombres ‚úåÔ∏è



I tell yous hombres - feels a bitty akin to a release, the whole transitioning over to alternative Leagues and Countries for selection purposes... Fresh shite to look at, after a big long spell staring at domestic & English pish. This season was - as the figures clearly show - an awakening for us here at DWT; shit got as real as it ever has - which for sure, hath been a nice tonic in the arm for Dad üíâüòé. And here, no that that means Dad is now a reliable source of unlimited wealth - far from it haha... but even if just for the bragging rights over Past-Dad - Terrific üôå. Evolution is the name of any game; if that happens to be a tried and tested formulae suddenly being looked at, that's one thing... tis entirely different if it's a case of the Creator finally garnering results from what bollocks they pursue. The now is, a transitional phase let's say; a step towards summat potentially exciting. Which for sure, sounds fairly exciting - but equally clearly indicative of much more to come owing to it no actually being that far along really. In other words - times a good bit by, were quite frankly, a pile of absolute SHITE. Tis therefore a bare minimum that one exceeds such performance...Dad Hath Done Such üôè. Should Dad say same in 6 months or so - shit'll be progressing just fucking dandily üëå

But Dad Knows - 6 months isnae long really - certainly no by current standards. Dad Yearns for a position that is properly news-worthy, of course he fucking does - but acceptance is and always will be, summat that will forever force Dad to mind his P's & Q's. There's an essence of games-playing amongst it all... sounds flippant to say given there's cash at stake - but we've all parted with cash to play some kind of game in life... if it isnae seen as somewhat of a game, tougher it is to squeeze joy out the cunt. The parameters adhered to insist on the essence of a game sure; limits obeyed regardless of potency - must be so. As such, one can become comfortable with the requirement, knowing full well in advance, that worst case scenario is not a big deal really, in one's own personal life. So it's with this in mind, Dad Suggests participation based purely on one's own comfort in possibly it being a bag of shite. Fair warning at least - but for sure, Dad'll be striving to make sure it generally is summat that covers bases a healthy percent of the time. We are coming in off a Whitewash mind you haha - say no fucking more ü§ö

First stab at the continent in a fair old whiley then; but tbf, much of the options are near season's end themselves ü§∑. For sure - closer looks could darn well'd've been 
had if shit was perfect and all the rest... truth of the matter is of course, Dad's a smidge cold on many of these leagues ‚úåÔ∏è. Meant a good deal of homework, trying to grab back a wee bitty info on all the bollocks... ach here - tis a tough time to judge even for the hardcore cunts ü§ö. So Dad's Kept shit fresh as much as poss; these games are a different energy from earlier on anyhow. More a case of recognising those handling the pressure best and all that sort of pish... Dad Feels comfortable with those opted for - s'all a cunt can do ü§ò. As such, feeling pretty groovy all being told - on the whole, Dad Hath been raking it in, in all sorts of ways; s'been a nice spell of self-indulgence, after a lengthy burst of selflessness. Tis a balance one must get right if one is to fuel one's own delight... Dad's always been a subscriber of long concentrated spells of each - squeeze the remnants right out the fucker ü™ó. Be fucking terrific therefore, is the recent upturn could continue - allow Dad to stare out at views in dressing gowns, a big smile on his face, cup of coffee gripped loosely in the hand üåÖ‚òïüòé


Let's see what happens ü§ò


------------------------

------------------------

DISCLAIMER: Dad is shit at this. As such, do not under any circumstances, take Dad's Advice seriously. By all means - show solidarity with a tiny fragment of your incomings if you are absolutely comfortable with doing so - but please be very aware, that Dad is in no position to provide owt other than polite thanks for the moral support. Other than that, alls there is, is a solid chance of disappointment.

Ok - serious pish out the way - let's delve in to the fucking numbers üôå

**CURRENT DWT RUNNING TOTAL IN 2025 STANDS AT: ¬£14.82**

**CURRENT DWT RUNNING TOTAL OVERALL STANDS AT: -¬£1281.76**

**CURRENT DWT RUNNING TOTAL TOWARDS NEXT DOUBLE-DWT STANDS AT: ¬£52.44**





------------------------

So without further ado, please allow Dad to unveil the next offering in this epic journey, one that has scoured Europe for the very best on offer and as a result has secured the biggest price since way back at DWT245:

**WOLVES**
------------------------
------------------------

+ **Form coming in is fucking TERRIFIC - a defeat away to Man C last time, the only blip in 7 (6 Wins)**

+ **Final moments seeing Cunha in a Wolves shirt probably - so much desire there'll be to end as high as fucking poss**

+ **1 Win in 7 conversely for brighton - and that was a 5-goal thriller over west ham... they've dropped tools**


The mystique brighton have created in the past few seasons, has created an illusion they mostly win... certainly no the fucking case recently üò±. The win rate pointed out above ^ - no much enthusiasm seems to be apparent ü§∑. Doesnae help they've an injury or three... cannae see them bringing much to the table in this fixture; the Cunha-related hoopla'll surely see to it Wolves are fully motivated to fuck them right up üëä. Great price by fuck - and it went out further after Dad Committed haha üò≠


------------------------
------------------------
**CELTA VIGO**
------------------------
------------------------

+ **Whilst improving current league position seems unlikely - much yet to do to secure current spot: The Motivation is High**

+ **A few losses dirtying up their form... but tbf, games against Real Madrid & Barca amongst them - no as bad as shite appears**

+ **A great opponent to host sure - 1 win in 10 suggests serious potential for destruction üí£**


So here's it: the first Overseas Selection of the 24/25 season üôå. Dad was Studious: These cunts are DETERMINED to push shit over the line - especially these Bread 'n' Butter-type affairs that'll focus more on 'how many' as much as 'hope for victory'. Visitors sevilla have crumbled into a fine fucking powder over the past several: 5 defeats and 2 draws - absolute SHITE üí©. Celta's strength at home'll be much too much for these fuds - expect safety early, probably üòé


------------------------
------------------------
**NICE**
------------------------
------------------------

+ **3 Wins IAR coming in - including a 1-3 away win over PSG... much to like about these bastards**

+ **Just 1 defeat in 6 OTR as well - 3 Wins recorded during this spell - the aim'll be a dominant victory**

+ **3 defeats in 5 home appearances for rennes - there's weaknesses to exploit for fucking sure**


A lengthy wait 'till this one Kicks Off... but Dad is CERTAIN it'll be fucking worth it ü§ò. 2 Games including this one left in the League Campaign... a simple case of MUST WIN: both of Nice's encounters are v, v winnable and no mistake. Do so and there's potential for finishing 2nd for the love of fuck: incentive is terrifically high. Certainly no the case for rennes... they've fuck all to care about, other than what sandals to pack in their suitcases. A routine end to a delicious Treble üòã

\---  
  
Nicolas Cage slammed his fist against the keyboard as the dreaded message flashed across his screen: ""Online Connection Error."" His face contorted into a mask of anguish, illuminated by the harsh glow of his gaming setup.

""No, no, no, NO!"" His voice started as a whisper before crescendoing into his signature roar. ""HOW CAN THIS BE HAPPENING?""

He frantically clicked the retry button, again and again, each failure driving him further into despair. For five glorious days he had lived and breathed Arc Raiders. He'd barely slept, surviving on a diet of microwaved burritos and energy drinks, his gaming chair now permanently molded to the shape of his body.

Now, the servers were offline and the playtest was over.

""THEY CAN'T DO THIS!"" he howled, springing from his chair and pacing his apartment wildly. The walls were covered with hastily scrawled notes about optimal loadout combinations and hand-drawn maps of his favorite extraction points Topside. ""THEY CAN'T JUST... TAKE IT AWAY!""

Nicolas grabbed his phone, frantically searching for information. The Arc Raiders Discord was exploding with activity, thousands of others all experiencing the same withdrawal.

""At least I'm not alone in this nightmare,"" he whispered, before his face contorted once more. ""BUT THAT DOESN'T MAKE IT ANY BETTER!""

He threw himself dramatically across his couch, arm draped over his eyes. ""I can still hear it all... the haunting whine when ARC spots you... the echo of gunfire across those beautiful, devastated landscapes...""

Suddenly, he sat bolt upright, eyes wild. ""The flare! That sound when a fellow Raider falls!"" He fumbled for his phone, pulling up a recording he'd made of the game's audio. ""I was smart enough to preserve SOME of it!""

He pressed play, the distinctive sound filling his apartment. His neighbor banged on the wall, but Nicolas was beyond caring about such mortal concerns now.

""HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO RETURN TO NORMAL LIFE?"" he screamed at his reflection in the mirror, gesturing wildly. ""Five days! They gave us five days to taste digital heaven, and now they REVEL in our suffering! Embark Studios... even their NAME is a cruel joke! They EMBARK us on this journey and then ABANDON us with no release date!""

Nicolas collapsed to his knees, hands raised to the heavens. ""I RISKED MY LIFE TOPSIDE! I BROUGHT BACK VALUABLE MATERIALS! I FORMED BONDS WITH MY FELLOW RAIDERS!""

He crawled to his computer, refreshing Embark's Twitter page for the hundredth time. ""Nothing! NOTHING! They're ENJOYING this silence! It SUSTAINS them!""

Three days later, Nicolas's agent finally broke into his apartment after concerned neighbors reported strange noises. He found Nicolas in a homemade fort constructed entirely of energy drink cans and takeout containers, a crude diorama of what appeared to be the Earth's surface recreated on his living room floor. A toy rooster sat in a place of honor on the coffee table.

""Nicolas?"" his agent ventured cautiously. ""You've missed three meetings.""

""Meetings?"" Nicolas laughed maniacally, his eyes bloodshot from lack of sleep. ""MEETINGS? While dear Scrappy waits for my safe return? While my extraction elevator stands idle?""

He gestured to the floor where he'd arranged his furniture to create what vaguely resembled an elevator shaft.

""I... think you need some rest,"" his agent suggested.

""REST?"" Nicolas sprang to his feet, his voice rising to that distinctive Cage fever pitch. ""Do you know what I've BEEN through? I've run for my life across the devastated surface of our planet! I've heard the sounds of my fellow Raiders falling around me! I fought the QUEEN!‚Äù

His eyes darted wildly as his chest heaved with frantic, ragged breathing.¬†

The agent backed toward the door. ""Maybe we should call someone‚Äî""

""The only call I want,"" Nicolas hissed dramatically, ""is the call of that extraction elevator when it's ready to take me and my hard-won loot back underground!""

Two weeks later, Nicolas sat in his darkened apartment, illuminated only by the glow of multiple monitors, each displaying a different social media page for Embark Studios. He had written a 247-page manifesto titled ""The Psychological Warfare of Embark's Silence: A Survivor's Account.""

His phone buzzed. A notification from Twitter. Embark Studios had finally posted.

His hands trembled as he clicked on the notification. It was just a cryptic image of the game's logo with no caption.

1kimlc8,https://www.reddit.com/r/googlecloud/comments/1kimlc8/ddos_98k_firebase_bill_guy_the_billing_support/,DDoS 98k Firebase Bill Guy: The Billing Support Story,"**Recap:** An attack on cloud buckets left me with a 98k firebase bill, a dead company and a trip to the ER. It was called [simmer.io](http://simmer.io), a Youtube for WebGL games with 140,000 users, some paid. I refunded 10k in user subscriptions, and I'm back to MRR: $0. **G reversed the charges yesterday.** ([technical details](https://www.reddit.com/r/googlecloud/comments/1kg9icb/one_public_firebase_file_one_day_98000_how_it/)).

For me personally, **I won't consider returning to this platform until they offer true spend caps**. It's a shame because Firebase is a very smooth developer experience and solved a lot of problems for me.

This is a post about GCP billing support.

The reason for this post is that I don't want to give the impression that they'll just fix your awful day without a LOT of diligence. In fairness, **this was resolved in under 30 days, which is commendable for such a large organization** (I worked at Meta for a few years, and can tell you that big tech companies are SLOOOOOW).

I'll start with some advice if you find yourself in a similar situation:

**Be polite and persistent.** Your support person may be the only advocate you have. If you're a dick, will they want to help you?

So here we go...

**Billing support chat:**

**Me:** OMG Everything is on fire, how do I shut it down?!!!

**G Support:** Unlink the billing account.

**Me:** I click unlink and it says account resources may become unrecoverable! What happens when I click the button?

**G Support:** You will have to reach out to technical support.

*Technical support is not free. Basic support is defined as $29 or 3% of monthly spend, whichever is higher. I believe this is fair under normal circumstances. But when your dashboard is showing $66,000 in charges, you start to do some nasty mental math.*

And, waiting four hours for tech support is not an option when your bill is growing by roughly $10,000 an hour.

**I eventually gave up trying to save the business and unlinked billing on my main project and a few other side projects. I went full nuclear and deleted all infrastructure.**

Then I started an email thread. I was honest and polite through the whole thing. In full transparency, I lost my cool a bit in some of the earlier chats. Not abusive, but impolite, given the panic of the situation.

I‚Äôm going to compress 3.5 weeks worth of interactions into a few paragraphs.

**Email thread**

**Me:** This was abuse, I was DoS‚Äôed. I stopped it as fast as I could.

**G Support:** OK.¬†

**Me:** I‚Äôm willing to discuss partial payment. Anything you can do for a customer that‚Äôs been with you for 7 years, paying $500/mo, and who lost their business?

**G Support:** No.

**Me:** Ok will you escalate?

**G Support:** Ok.

**Me:** Any updates?

**G Support:** Form letter. This is one of the many risks of cloud. You are responsible for the bill.

**Me:** I was attacked, billing alerts came in after 50k in damage, I shut it off fast. Will you escalate?

*‚Ä¶ silence ‚Ä¶*

I called a software engineer friend at G. ‚ÄúPlease beg them to take another look at case \[#XXXXXX\]‚Äù.

**G Support:** This is \[Jim\] I‚Äôm a support manager and I will be taking over this case. Please wait while we have a technical team review.

**Me:** Ok.

**Me:** IP address \[x.x.x.x\] sent \[XXX\] Million requests observed through my Cloudflare dashboard. I don‚Äôt have logs for direct bucket reads. I have also filed a Bughunters report that demonstrates how \[storage object configuration\] can lead to 1M in egress charges over the course of a day in an abusive scenario.

**G Support:** The technical team reviewed and confirmed a denial of service. I have requested a one-time goodwill credit. Please wait.

**Me:** Ok

**Me:** Are you there?

**G Support:** Good news, we‚Äôre crediting your bill for 49K (no mention of where the number came from, or any technical details of the attack. I‚Äôm assuming it was just a straight 50%)

**Me:** You are the world's greatest support person. Billing alerts were delayed. This is still a life altering bill. Can you do more?

*‚Ä¶silence‚Ä¶*

**Me:** Are you there?

**Me:** Are you there?¬†

**Me:** I hint that I want to tell the story publicly.

**Me:** Are you there?¬†I lost my business. Isn't that enough? I provide more technical details.

*I contact more friends at G, asking them to request support does another appeal.*

**G Support:** I sincerely empathize with your situation. We'll do another review.

*This was likely overseas support. They list Philippine Standard Time on the bottom of the email, but I notice that they CC'ed a sales manager closer to home base. I email them.*

**Me, to Sales Mgr:** Here's a summary of the situation. Can you advocate for my case? Are you willing to do a call?

**Sales Mgr:** Support will contact you.

I notice a meeting link at the bottom of their email that allows you to schedule a meeting. I schedule a meeting.

**Me, to Sales Mgr:** I scheduled a meeting with you to quickly discuss the issue.

**Sales Mgr:** I cancelled the meeting. This is outside my jurisdiction. Support will help you.

*This was an inflection point for me. I replied back with a one-liner: ""****Bummer****"". And then I made the big post to reddit about what happened, and how it could happen to most anyone.*

Someone on reddit reached out to me with an executive's email address. I emailed the exec, and did not get a response.

I continued to go on my post storm, with reddit posts reaching about 1M views across a few different communities.

**G Support:** We have reversed the charges. Have a nice day.

**Me:** Thanks. You need to create spending limits so this doesn't happen to others. I'm going to continue to advocate for change.

This. Was. An. Ordeal.

The human cost: **I ended up in the ER at one point** with intense abdominal pain due to the stress of the situation (coffee + no food for days is not good for your stomach). I think about those that are less connected than me, and who don't have the fortitude to tell all publicly.

What happens to them?

1kimkvi,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueChristian/comments/1kimkvi/attending_my_first_orthodox_liturgy/,Attending my First Orthodox Liturgy,"Someone a few days asked about inquirers into Orthodoxy, and I thought I might share something I wrote almost a decade ago, immediately after attending my first Orthodox service.

\_\_\_\_\_

  
After a lifetime as a ""Bible-believing"" Baptist and a decade of trying to be a Pentecostal Christian, and after talking with a priest and researching online, I attended my first Orthodox liturgy in 2014.

I could tell you about the little shelves just inside the front door of the church, stocked with brochures explaining various points of Orthodox theology. I could tell you about the warm greeting from the gentleman that met us at the door, joking to put us at ease.

What I remember was the fragrance.

When we moved from the small antechamber through the double doors into the temple, my senses were immediately overwhelmed. The sweet odor of incense floated on the air. Smoke from a censer cast a faint haze in the room, making everything appear in soft focus. The warm flicker of candles danced upon the gold leaf of the innumerable icons covering the walls.

There were no benches and the gathered people stood for most of the liturgy. I could describe the magnificent prayers, sung with a heavenly beauty that made every praise band I'd ever heard seem like rank amateurs. I could detail the robes of the priest and his deacon that shimmered as they recited exhortations perfected 1700 years ago.

What I remember was the icon of Christ.

I spent much of the liturgy gazing at the large painting, mounted on the right side of the wooden partition separating the people from the holy area. This was not the frail, emaciated Jesus of Renaissance art. His furrowed brow and intense gaze bored into me with a masculinity and power I had never seen in depictions of Christ. In one hand was a Gospel book, the other hand raised to bless the viewer. This was no fainting messiah; it was an invitation to know the God of the universe.

I could tell you about the humility of the women, heads covered with veils as they crossed themselves and bowed deeply before kissing icons placed on stands around the room. I could talk about the children moving and playing and giving a life and vibrance to the room, not tucked out of sight in a nursery.

What I remember was the icon of Mary.

She too gazed at the viewer, her head gently resting against the face of the infant Jesus as she cradled Him in her arms. Though her eyes seemed to seek mine, every line of her image and fold of her clothing pointed me toward the child in her arms. This was not the Mary I had been taught to think of as a mere delivery vessel. This was the Theotokos - the God Bearer.

I could tell you about how friendly everyone was and how welcome we felt. I could tell you how genuine the fellowship seemed at the coffee hour that followed the liturgy. I could tell you that a woman chased us down in the parking lot to introduce herself and tell us she had converted to Orthodoxy after a lifetime as a Protestant.

What I remember was the emptiness I felt at not being able to receive the Eucharist.

Taking a small cracker and a cup of grape juice was a metaphorical act in the churches I had attended all my life. It was an occasional remembrance of a meal long ago. This was something different.

The reverence and awe with which this bread and wine were treated made me feel more of an outsider than anything that had come before. There was an immediacy to this ceremony, as if God Himself were offering us His energies in that moment.

When someone offered me a small piece of blessed bread as a sign of fellowship, I was grateful for the gesture while feeling even more separation from what was taking place at the chalice.

I could go on for a long time telling you about the sights and sounds I experienced.

What I remember was knowing that after a lifetime of searching I had found the true Church.",1,1746807676.0,TrueChristian,5,0.67,False

1kimjqg,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/1kimjqg/kendu_the_run_to_the_billions_has_started/,Kendu - The Run to The Billions Has Started,"Kendu is a completely organic memecoin that is on Ethereum, Solana and BASE. We are entirely focused on community output and have nearly 18k holders. Whilst I am positive you have seen Kendu either on Twitter, Reddit(especially recently), Stocktwits, Coin Market Cap, Instagram or wherever else, I will still give a quick overview.  
Kendu is over a year old with an ATH of 283 million, we now have over double the holders and our current chart looks very similar to a few weeks before ATH was reached.  
Kendu reached 50k votes to earn a free Certik audit, the only other coin to ever do this was Pepe... Certik rates our community at 98/100 whilst other coins with a ""praised"" community have a score in the 70s. Kendu is outworking coins in the hundreds of millions, come on guys, it is plain to see where we are headed.

**IRL EVENTS**

* Kendu Street Team, they have visited 3 festivals in Florida with the most recent one being Florida Groves Festival. The other 2 festivals, was Miami Music Week and Miami Art Basel. At these festivals, murals were created, Kendu energy cocktails were given out and Kendu merch was given out!
* Kendu Entertainment, a glow in the dark pickleball tournament in India that is gaining lots of traction within the sport. There has recently been a media drop from these events. There is also talks of parties coming soon!

**IRL PRODUCTS**

* Kendu Energy - An Energy drink company that sells both full sugar and sugar free versions, this is the only product that I have tried. It is GREAT
* Kendu Coffee - A coffee company that sells both caffeinated and decaf coffee farmed in Brazil
* Kendu Merch - t-shirts, caps, hoodies, you name it!
* Kendu animation - a team that is making a short, Japanese style, animation series about Kendu, they have released an episode so far!
* Kendu games - a board game made by 2 chads
* Kendu Creator- a 3d printable mask that can be used to make videos online, this means you can showcase your skills whilst still remaining anonymous
* Kendu pendants - A Kendu style dog tag
* Kendu Beer - not out yet, but it is in the making and the prototype is out
* Kendu Video Games - made by professional developers, this is not out yet but we have seen sneak peeks. I think it will be available on Steam.
* Tattoos - A lot of holders have Kendu tattoos, I have a massive amount of respect for these people. There is 1 that I cannot show though : )
* Murals - Spray painted art

  
**What to look for in a Memecoin and why Kendu has that**

A community is what gives memecoins value and Kendu has arguably the best community in crypto, our social media efforts are unparalled on Reddit and Twitter, this alone would make us a contender for the best performing memecoin....this is without our unprecedented IRL presence. We are at the base of the biggest Alt Season in Crypto history and we truly have the potential to 1000x and in my opinion we can 3000x. Shib went from 22 million to 22 billion in 36 days, so why can't Kendu? It has already been proven that community is all you need by the memecoin hall of famers, Kendu is no different.  
Join the Telegram and check out the community even if you are not a holder, the vibes are incredible.

Position yourself wisely, Kendu will rise with or without you

How Realbotix‚Äôs AI-Powered Bots and Crypto Cache Are Winning Hearts and Wallets

https://preview.redd.it/1ppnqt4c7sze1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=56166264b615f7569b44cdf7a7712cd6b907766f

Hold onto your circuit boards, folks‚ÄîRealbotix Corp. (XBOTF) is making waves in the market, and it‚Äôs not just because their humanoid robots are smoother talkers than your average Wall Street broker. As of this morning, the stock skyrocketed from a modest $0.2085 to a dazzling $0.2500 USD, leaving investors buzzing like a server room on overdrive. So, what‚Äôs fueling this robotic rally? Grab a coffee, because this story‚Äôs got more juice than a Tesla battery pack.

**The Rise of Realbotix: From Tokens to Touchy-Feely Tech**

Once known as [Tokens.com](http://Tokens.com), Realbotix has shed its crypto chrysalis to emerge as a trailblazer in AI-powered humanoid robots. Headquartered in Toronto with a manufacturing hub in Nevada, this company isn‚Äôt just building bots‚Äîthey‚Äôre crafting companions with silicone skin so lifelike, you‚Äôd swear they‚Äôre ready to star in the next rom-com. Think Ex Machina meets The Jetsons, but with a mission to revolutionize healthcare, education, and, yes, good old-fashioned companionship.

Their flagship products, like the Melody robot unveiled at CES 2025, have been turning heads faster than a paparazzi flash. With over 4 billion media impressions and coverage from Forbes to CNET, Realbotix is proving that robots can be more than just vacuum cleaners with attitude. And with integrations like OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT, Meta‚Äôs Llama, and Google‚Äôs Gemini, these bots are smarter than your average PhD candidate.

**Why the Stock‚Äôs Got Legs (and Arms, and AI)**

So, why did Realbotix‚Äôs stock do a moonwalk today? While no single headline screamed ‚ÄúEureka!‚Äù on May 9, the tea leaves point to a perfect storm of hype and hustle. First, let‚Äôs talk about their upcoming gig at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas (May 27-29). Realbotix announced on X that their AI-powered humanoid, Ms\_Xbot, will be greeting guests at The Venetian Resort, likely charming the socks off crypto bros and investors alike. Nothing says ‚Äúbuy our stock‚Äù like a robot that can network better than LinkedIn.

Then there‚Äôs the financial flex. Realbotix‚Äôs Q1-2025 results, dropped in February, were juicier than a Silicon Valley startup pitch: a 419% revenue spike to $858,275 and a net income of $918,324. For a company that‚Äôs been around the block, that‚Äôs not just growth‚Äîthat‚Äôs a glow-up. Add to that a $13.77 million cryptocurrency portfolio (no capital raise needed, thank you very much) and a partnership with Compass UOL backed by a $100,000 AWS subsidy, and you‚Äôve got a recipe for investor FOMO.

Oh, and let‚Äôs not forget the X factor. Posts from RealbotixCorp have been lighting up the platform, from their Tix4Lv collaboration for a robotic ticket kiosk in Vegas to CEO Andrew Kiguel‚Äôs bold vision of a future where robots are as common as smartphones. One X user, beach\_trades, caught the vibe early today, noting the stock‚Äôs leap from 19 to 25 cents with a trader‚Äôs glee. When the X crowd‚Äôs buzzing, you know something‚Äôs up.

https://preview.redd.it/5ktcybnf7sze1.png?width=595&format=png&auto=webp&s=6be7a15c14ab9fc46c7801cbee205d5b3d58721b

**The Big Picture: Robots Are the New Black**

Zoom out, and Realbotix is riding a wave bigger than a tsunami. A Morgan Stanley report, cited in a May 2 Realbotix X post, projects the humanoid robot market could hit $5 trillion annually by 2050, with a billion units strutting their stuff. That‚Äôs not pocket change‚Äîthat‚Äôs a paradigm shift. With their new customer-focused website (launched December 17, 2024) and robots like Aria popping up on national TV, Realbotix is positioning itself as the Apple of androids.

But it‚Äôs not all smooth sailing. The robotics game is a crowded one, with players like Tesla and Figure AI flexing their own mechanical muscles. Realbotix will need to keep innovating faster than a neural network to stay ahead. Still, with no debt, a hefty crypto war chest, and a knack for making headlines, they‚Äôre playing a strong hand.

**The Verdict: A Stock to Watch, Not Just Hug**

Realbotix‚Äôs stock surge today is no fluke‚Äîit‚Äôs the sound of a company hitting its stride. From Bitcoin 2025 buzz to financials that scream ‚Äúwe‚Äôre here to stay,‚Äù they‚Äôre giving investors plenty to smile about. Will they keep climbing? If their robots are half as charming as their market strategy, I‚Äôd bet my last Bitcoin they will.

For now, keep your eyes on XBOTF. Whether you‚Äôre an investor or just a sci-fi nerd, Realbotix is proof that the future isn‚Äôt coming‚Äîit‚Äôs already here, and it‚Äôs got a silicone handshake.
