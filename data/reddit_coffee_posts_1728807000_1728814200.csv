I‚Äôm interested to find out about good options for co-working around the east of the city centre of the Hague (other options I would consider are Rijswijk, Delft, Voorburg, Ypenburg). Very keen to hear your experiences.

My needs, in order of importance. The first two really are must-haves, the other more nice-to-have:

1. Flexible contract (no fixed days / number of days)
2. Social / creative vibe (not too office-y)
3. Options for second screen (focus time) and phone booths (calls/meetings)
4. Good coffee
5. Safe/secure bike parking
6. Nice walks in the vicinity
7. Car parking / OV accessibility

But like‚Ä¶ I read The Alchemist and honestly, I couldn‚Äôt even be bothered to remember the main guy‚Äôs name by page 20. It‚Äôs a ""modern classic,"" so I guess I was supposed to care?? Spoiler: I didn‚Äôt.

Now, I‚Äôm reading Before the Coffee Gets Cold 1 (yeah, I ordered the sequels because I have no self-control) and I‚Äôm supposed to care about these random people in the first 5 pages?? Nope. I‚Äôm here because some rando on the internet told me it was good and, hey, the concept sounded kinda interesting. But as for the characters? Couldn‚Äôt care less.

Like, I get it, there‚Äôs conflict or whatever in the beginning, but it‚Äôs not like it slapped me in the face and screamed ‚ÄúTHIS IS INTERESTING.‚Äù I knew what was going to happen, and I just sort of‚Ä¶ kept reading? And then, 40-ish pages in, I was like, ‚Äúoh wow, that was kind of nice.‚Äù But, you know, not in a way that made me rethink my entire life or anything. Just nice.

So, riddle me this, writing geniuses - do we actually need a hook? Or is that just some myth perpetuated by people who think readers have the attention span of a goldfish?

Everything in *silence*. The loudest noise in our apartment is his PC making a fuss now and again, and outside is my neighbor's toddler wailing in the hallway, which always reminds me of how amazing the option is to just live quietly.

This is something I can't imagine ever wanting to give up; not the quiet peace, not the option to save or splurge money on new skincare or an aquarium in this case, not the option to plant my butt on the couch the entire day and watch youtube or twitch or indulge in one of my five hundred hobbies.

No one forced me out of bed this morning. No one is screaming for food, crying, craving my attention. I spent half the morning on the floor admiring my new fish, and for the rest of the day I'll probably drink more coffee, enjoy video games myself, spend another hour in front of the aquarium, maybe do some plant care.

1g2man4,https://www.reddit.com/r/widowers/comments/1g2man4/left_alone/,Left Alone ,"My darling husband took his own life just at the end of August 2024. 

His taking his own life was a complete shock to me. Life was pretty good and we were happily married. We had just celebrated our fifth-year wedding anniversary in early July and my birthday was in the middle of August. There were a few things that were bothering him, but nothing that didn't seem too overwhelming. 

I miss him so fucking much. Every minute. Every day. He truly was the best husband and partner anyone could have asked for. He always made me coffee every morning, gave me foot rubs, tolerated my random jumpscares, and washed my hair from time to time. He just spoiled me rotten. 

Now that he's gone, I have no one to share the randomest shit with: 

* quoting Robocop (his favorite movie)
* talking about the latest technology (he and I are both tech nerds and love that kind of stuff)
* watching the latest r/RedLetterMedia video
* watching the newest movie or tv show that interested us
* playing video games, especially co-op games like Overcooked or It Takes Two 
* going to markets and discussing what to make for dinner

I could keep adding to that list, but the truth is, he's gone. He's not coming back home to me and Lucy, our little ragdoll kitty. We were both working on our fertility journey as well and I was a few days away from finding out the results of my IUI when he passed away (it turned out to be negative). 

I think the hardest part, is that he's an Australian and I moved here from the US to be with him, not knowing anyone. I've lived here now for a little under 10 years but I've never known life without him here. He only had a small circle of close friends and most of the jobs I had were remote so when I finally did make some in-person friends, it was really nice! 

At first, I hated living in Australia. It's not the same as the US and I was missing a lot of my friends, family and regular routines, like going to baseball games or hanging out with my friends and going to Disneyland. 

After my husband passed, everyone started asking me ""So are you going back to the US now?"" And the truth is, probably not. It's so hard for me to admit this, but I've grown adjusted here and we were looking to permanently set roots down here. I really grew to like the area we were living in. I envisioned seeing our family grow here. 

I love you, my handsome man. You will always be my forever. ",1,1728813562.0,widowers,0,1.0,False
1g2maio,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ultramarathon/comments/1g2maio/race_report_utmb_nice_c√¥te_dazur_100_miles/,Race Report ‚Äì UTMB Nice C√¥te d‚ÄôAzur 100 Miles,"When I prepared for this race, I was looking around trying to find some race report. But I didn‚Äôt find many. That‚Äôs one of the reasons I‚Äôm writing this post. I also write it to not forget about it. It was my first 100 miler attempt which came with a few uncertainties. How will I cope with running through an entire night? How well will food go down during 30-40 hours? The maximum time I‚Äôve been running before that was 22 hours at the Swiss Alps 100.

Before the race

The training
In the early June of 2024 I did the Mozart 100. After that I didn‚Äôt run that much, but always thought about maybe doing a 100 miler later in the year. Eventually I took a decision and signed up for the UTMB Nice C√¥te d‚ÄôAzur 100 Miler in October 2024. I had 5 weeks of peak training.

After being around 120 km, a 140 km (87 miles) week was followed by a 130 (81 miles) one with similar elevation gain (3400 m, 11‚Äô000 ft). After that I went into a 80 km, 50 km taper (50 miles, 30 miles). That was quite a reduction. Maybe too much. But I hoped this was enough after anyway building up mileage the whole year. No strength training, no cross training, except 1-2 hikes.

The course and my strategy
According to the website the course has (in the year 2024) a distance of 157.5 km (97.86 miles) and an elevation gain of 8200m (26902 feet). It‚Äôs almost always up and down. The hope was that the course becomes easier at the later stages because there‚Äôs less elevation gain and one doesn‚Äôt need to run on high altitude anymore.

As always before an ultra, I prepared my pacing strategy with ultrapacer.com. I then copied over the strategy to my own excel and listed three variants, A, B and C. In that case it was 30 hours for A, 33 hours for B and if a lot goes wrong I was ready to be underway for 37 hours.

For each of the sections I also calculated fluid, food, and sodium intakes. I usually use products of Precision Fuel & Hydration. 

This helps me to get an idea about how fast I can go and what I should consume. However, I‚Äôm well aware that everything will be different anyway. It‚Äôs just about getting into the right areas. Then I would need to adapt on the go and manage myself well on the course.

The day before the race
On Thursday I picked up my bib and went to eat a pizza at 18:00. After that I finalised packing and went to bed early to get a good night of sleep.

What did I pack
The day before the race, they activated the cold weather kit. I was informed by Livetrail with an SMS

‚ÄúNICE100M: basic kit and bad weather kit activated. Caution: Intense cold and wind conditions at passage de Rabuons.‚Äù

This meant I wouldn‚Äôt have to deal with warm temperatures. I welcomed that, but it also meant, that I had to pack a few things more.

I took a lot of gels and gums with me. I had an extra long-sleeve layer even. The rest of it was mandatory + cold weather equipment. Nothing special, the Adv Skin 12 of Salomon was good enough to hold everything.

The race
The bus to the starting line in Auron was planned for 7:30 on Friday morning. Calculating it back from that meant I should get up at 6:15 and start walking from the hotel to the parking space at 6:45. When I arrived around 7:10 at the Quai du Commerce there was already a bus standing there and it was almost full. I was wondering a bit and asked then if i could join this one too with an 7:30 ticket and that was apparently fine. So, I got on the bus with my drop back and race vest and the 2 hour drive to Auron began. I ate some waffles and drank a bit of water. On the way to the starting line we could already see some of the aid stations. While driving the landscape became wilder. A teaser of what was to follow afterwards on the trail.

In Auron I sat down next to an oval that was probably used as an ice skating field a few months later. There was also the location to hand over the drop bag. The single drop bag would then be transported to Saint Sauveur sur Tin√©e (62 km, 38 miles) and Levens (113 km, 70 miles) before being available at the finish line again.

It was sunny and therefore good to sit outside. I was eating again a bit of waffles and drinking water. Next to the oval there was a single toilet. Tip here: visit it early, to avoid a huge line. Also in there you could fill the flasks for the race. Probably you could also visit one of the restaurants or hotels there in Auron to either go to the toilet or fill up water.
I could see different strategies, how to overcome the 2:30 hours waiting time until the start. Some were eating, some were sleeping, some were walking around, while I was just sitting there and waiting. I‚Äôve studied the first 3 sections and tried to remember the paces I planned for it, 8:00, 15:00, 10:30 minutes per km.

Auron ‚Äì St. Etienne de Tin√©e
Stats: 8.1 km, 216 m+, 673 m-
(5 miles, 709 ft+, 2,208 ft)

The weather report would have actually announced rain around 12:00 which was the start time. But it continued to be sunny until lunch time. Around 11:45 I did some short running to activate my body again after sitting most of the time. Shortly after that I walked to the starting line and positioned myself somewhere in the middle, not too quick, not too slow.

Somewhere in the front, I think they interviewed Courtney Dauwalter, but I didn‚Äôt hear much. Also the race briefing wasn‚Äôt very audible. But I was confident to not have missed anything important because I had studied the course well. We started at 12:00 and were cheered on by a big crowd in Auron. Later I found out that the race had 576 starters for the 100 miler. At the start there was already a slight ascent. So, I held back and tried to get slowly into it. It was tarmac roads for the first kilometer I think before we switched to wide nature roads. I started to overtake some, but still tried to start slowly.

After a little bit of ascent, there was a 670m descent down to St. Etienne de Tin√©e. This was mostly on a single trail. So, overtaking was a bit tricky, but not impossible. I shouted ‚Äú√Ä gauche!‚Äù or ‚Äú√Ä droite!‚Äù at times because most of the runners around me were French speaking. Still I tried to not go too fast. In St. Etienne de Tin√©e I‚Äôve just filled some water. Nutrition-wise I began with alternating between Gels and Gums every 20 mins (30g carbs each).
Tip: I‚Äôve disabled the auto lap on my Garmin and planned to press the lap button after each aid station. Like that I would have an idea about the paces between each aid station. When I pressed the lap button the first time I saw 7:30 min/km. So, I was not too fast, but even a bit faster than the planned 8:00 per km. In hindsight, it would have been wise to go a bit faster here as you will see in the next section.

St. Etienne de Tin√©e ‚Äì Refuge de Rabuons
Stats: 9 km, 1404 m+, 33 m-, total 17.1 km
(5.6 miles, 4,606 ft+, 108 ft-, total 10.6 miles)

After a one minute stop at the first aid station, I continued through the village before reaching the start of the first big climb. 1400m (4600 ft) up on a distance of 9 km (5.6 miles) on a single trail. I did so many hill repeats of around 200-250m (650 - 820 ft) ascent per km at our local Uetliberg in Zurich that I was quite confident to manage this well. And with confidence came also a bit of frustration. Because of the single trail, it was hard to overtake and we were running into a traffic jam early on. Anyway, I heard it‚Äôs important to go slow in the beginning of a 100 miler. I overtook some other runners where it was safe, but tried to be patient.

Regarding nutrition it went worse at this point. It almost felt like I‚Äôm having a stone in my stomach. I tried to continue with 30 grams of carbs, but decreased the intake to 60 grams per hour. According to the race profile info there was a toilet in the Refuge de Rabuons and I planned to use that to improve the situation once the climb was done. After the steep climb a flatter section followed alongside rocks. On the right hand side a big cliff. This part was somewhat runnable and the views were amazing. Although one could see that rain was soon going to start with more and more clouds building.

After another short climb I reached the second aid station. There I ate something small and then asked for the location of the toilets. Unfortunately though there was an issue with water and no toilets were available! This meant I had to endure another 19 km and a big downhill. I didn‚Äôt waste a lot of time at the aid station and continued.

Refuge de Rabuons ‚Äì Isola village
Stats: 19 km, 368 m+, 2047 m-, total 36.2 km
(11.8 miles, 1,207 ft+, 6,715 ft-, total 22.5 miles)

This was the worst section for me. It was technical, I couldn‚Äôt eat much and felt low in energy. There was another climb after the aid station before we reached the highest point of the course at around 2650 m (8694 feet).

Shortly after that I had a fall and landed on my hands and the right knee. A guy helped me to get up again and was asking if everything is fine. Well, the fall wasn‚Äôt that bad, but I was not okay overall. The first time in my short ultra running ‚Äúcareer‚Äù of 3 years, I thought about giving up and getting a DNF, if things wouldn‚Äôt improve. That was crazy because I was only 20 km into the race and I had started cautiously! In addition to that, the promised rain started and I switched to the rain jacket, trying to continue through this rocky landscape. Other runners were overtaking me now while I just tried to not trip and fall again.

Somewhere in the middle of the 19 km was another small aid station. That wasn‚Äôt even officially announced on the website. A good point to fill up the water before the big descent of 2000m would start. The descent was consisting of switch backs on a single trail. Not pleasant, but also not that bad because it was still early and at least my legs felt good. I‚Äôve said to myself many times on that section: ‚ÄúThe race kickstarts in Isola! Everything will be better from then onwards!‚Äù. Finally, and almost four hours after leaving Refuge de Rabuons, I‚Äôve reached the aid station of Isola and went straight to the toilet. After that I drank some coffee, ate salty stuff and orange slices. Eventually I felt better, a lot better! Ultra running needs a well working digestive system. There‚Äôs no way around that. From the start I went with one flask of plain water and another one containing a water electrolyte mix. I think this was also a mistake as it was not sunny at all and my sweating level was low. Eating cheese, dry meat and peanuts at the aid stations was probably enough. I‚Äôm not quite sure, but I think the strong electrolyte mix contributed to a bad state. I stopped to take it.

Isola village ‚Äì Pont de Paule
Stats: 12.2 km, 726 m+, 894 m- (total 48.5 km)
(7.6 miles, 2,381 ft+, 2,933 ft-, total 30.1 miles)

With newly found energy, I left Isola and started the climb. It was often like that throughout the race. Descent to an aid station and shortly after that a climb again. I was hoping that the terrain would improve now and the up and down gets easier. Anyway, I was feeling way better because my stomach was fine again. I don‚Äôt have much memories of this section. It was 12 km to the next aid station and it darkened quickly. I‚Äôve got my headlamp out and put my rain jacket back as it wasn‚Äôt raining much anymore.

I‚Äôve planned between 2:10 and 2:42 for that section. The actual time spent was 2:35. So, I was okay again. What was not okay, was the aid station in Pont de Paule since there was no water anymore available. I drank some N√§√§k and Bouillon and the aid station volunteers even opened up lemonade bottles. My flasks were half empty and the next section would again be 800 m (2,624 ft) climbing and 950 m (3,116 ft) descending on 13.6 km (8.4 miles). I‚Äôve planned almost 3 hours for that. There was no way I could leave without full flasks even though it was night. After some minutes they announced that water was on its way. And shortly after that a car arrived and 30 runners were eagerly filling up their flasks. I was ready to continue. 50km (31 miles) on the clock and at the next aid station there was my drop bag where I planned to switch at least the T-Shirt.

Pont de Paule ‚Äì Saint Sauveur sur Tin√©e
Stats: 13.6 km, 808 m+, 964 m- (total 62.1 km)
(8.4 miles, 3,116 ft+, 3,162 ft-, total 38.6 miles)

I‚Äôve reached Saint Sauveur sur Tin√©e around 00:45. This section went well again and I was between plan A and B for those 13.6 km. Nutrition went well and the energy levels were fine. When I entered the station my bib number was shouted and I had my drop bag within seconds. That was well organised. Also the buffet at that station was quite big and they even had yoghurts. I stayed with what I knew and filled up my flasks with water and N√§√§k carb mix (water melon). With my drop bag I went into a small tent and changed socks, T-Shirt and long-sleeve shirt. I thought that was a good choice after the rain and the not so warm night. I had a power bar in my drop bag and quickly checked the loading state of my Garmin. 68% after a little bit more than a third of the course sounded good. I was planning to charge it in Levens at 112 km (70 miles) to be safe for the finish. It only happened when it is on Strava üòâ

Saint Sauveur sur Tin√©e ‚Äì Valdeblore La Colmiane
Stats: 8.5 km, 784 m+, 324 m- (total 70.6 km)
(5.3 miles, 2,572 ft+, 1,062 ft-, total 43.7 miles)

I was happy about the next section‚Äôs characteristics. I liked the uphills, but hated the downhills. For my safe approach of just finishing my first 100 miler, I couldn‚Äôt risk a lot on the rocky downhills. So, it was always a bit annoying to run/walk them. This section only had 300 m (984 ft) descent. The 784m (2,572 ft) ascent was a preview of the second big climb overall that would follow after that. Also here I don‚Äôt have much memories. I still felt quite good and never thought about sleep although it was almost 3 o‚Äôclock in the night when I‚Äôve reached Valdeblore.

Valdeblore La Colmiane ‚Äì Granges de la Brasque
Stats: 15.2 km 1221 m+, 477 m- (total 85.8 km)
(9.4 miles, 4,005 ft+, 1,564 ft-, total 53.3 miles)

I was shivering a little from the cold when I left the aid station. Therefore I tried to move fast and pull up the hood of my jacket to keep myself warm. 1220 meters (4,000 ft) of climbing were announced on the next section of 15.2 km (9.4 miles). We would go up again to over 2000 meters (6,561 ft) above see level. The climbing in the forest was steep and rocky, but I liked it. Once we were above tree level though, the climbing continued in alpine meadows and it even was a bit slippery because it was wet. Little crystals were shining in the headlamp. It wasn‚Äôt frozen or full of snow, but there was a small layer of almost frozen water on the trail.

The night lightened up and eventually I saw the sun rising. At that point I was already on the downhill to the next aid station.

On that section I had my next low point. It wasn‚Äôt my stomach, it wasn‚Äôt my quads, I was not cold anymore. But one of my shoes didn‚Äôt survive the downhill and the upper broke near the toes.

This was one of the big questions, I had before the race. Shall I buy a new shoe? I‚Äôve had those Speedgoat 5s with around 250 km (155 miles) and thought they will be fine for another ultra. I had already worn them for the Mozart 100 that was very muddy and rainy. And to be honest, I should have probably cleaned them better after that. Also for the downhill they might have been half a number too small. Anyway, I was there 7:20 in the morning in Granges de la Brasque with a broken shoe and 30 km from my drop bag where I had another pair. At this aid station the volunteers were great! One guy tried to fix my shoe with tape, while another girl was filling my flasks. The tape didn‚Äôt work and I had no other choice than to continue with those shoes. Well, one guy that gave up at that point wanted to give his shoes to me, but I couldn‚Äôt accept that. I didn‚Äôt slip out with my toes, they were just not well protected and it was a bit awkward to run.

Another guy at the aid station was explaining that the next section would be very nice. Apparently the run through the forest must be beautiful and eventually one would see Utelle (the next aid station) from above. After some break I continued in the sun hoping for at least a good trail.

Granges de la Brasque ‚Äì Utelle
Stats: 14.5 km, 233 m+, 1157 m- (total 100.1km)
(9 miles, 764 ft+, 3,795 ft-, total 62.2 miles)

The first part after Granges de la Brasque was quite runnable in comparison to the rest of the race. There were forest roads. But shortly after that a downhill through the forest began that was changing to a rocky downhill after that.
In other reports about other ultras I‚Äôve read that the sunrise would fill you with new energy. I knew about the sleep system and the decrease in melatonin levels thanks to light exposure. But I wasn‚Äôt sleepy because I had a great night of sleep before the race. So, I didn‚Äôt experience a great improvement at the first light of the day and was a bit disappointed. Anyway I felt fine and ready to tackle that second day which I hoped was the last one were I needed to run.

Utelle was indeed visible from above. And while I liked the section through the forest I didn‚Äôt like the rocky trail afterwards. The 1100 m (3660 ft) downhill was again a bit hard. I still tried to save my quads with a cautious downhill approach. Eventually I reached 100 km (62.1 miles). I said to myself, that this is the part I know because I have done 100 kilometer ultras before. Everything that follows would be new territory for me. 22:30 hours on the clock meant that I had paced well and hopefully still had something in the tank for the last 60 kms (37.3 miles).

Utelle ‚Äì Levens
Stats: 12 km, 363 m+, 620 m- (total 112.1 km)
(7.4 miles, 1,190 ft+, 2,034 ft-, total 69.6 miles)

The section to Levens was okay. The analysis after the race showed that I was on my Plan B (33 hours finish) pace for the rather flat 12 km (7.4 miles). I alternated between running and speed hiking. At some point I was overtaken by the first 100 km runner. From now on they would be on the same course as we, the slower, 100 milers. This was confusing me at times. Anyway, I had to run my own race and not think about others. I was counting down the kilometers I had to run with the broken shoe. At least I could just kick out the small stones whenever they entered my shoe from above. And for sure my right toes could breath well üòÄ 

Finally Levens arrived after a short uphill and I entered the aid station. I charged my Garmin at that point and switched to the Tecton X2s. I continued with one flask N√§√§k and one flask water, but also regularly consumed my gels. What didn‚Äôt go down well were the gums I had. And for the gels I tried to wash them down with water as quickly as possible to not really taste them. This helped to not get taste fatigue after 25 hours on the clock.

Levens ‚Äì Chapelle St Michel
Stats: 6.5 km, 889 m+, 121 m- (total 118.6 km)
(4 miles, 2,916 ft+, 396 ft-, total 73.7 miles)

New shoe, new energy I thought when I started the last 45 km (28 miles). This is were I had my third low point. The sun was out, it was the middle of the day and a big 900 m (2,916 ft) climb was next. I couldn‚Äôt judge whether it was just the climb and the sun that made me feel weak or if there was something else not okay. That is why I took some breaks in the shades every time I found some. People overtook me and asked if everything was alright. It was okay, I just didn‚Äôt want to risk a lot.

This climb and a short descent took me 2 hours 40 min. Planned was something between 1:30 and 1:52. It looked like the plan was useless at that point of time and I would be in for some running in the night again.

Chapelle St Michel ‚Äì Tourrette-Levens
Stats: 12.1 km, 198m+, 1100m- (total 130.7 km)
(7.5 miles, 649 ft+, 3,608 ft-, total 81.2 miles)

The next section went far better. Even though it had a 1100 m (3600 ft) descent I could speed up a bit and was almost on my Plan A pace. The Tourrette-Levens aid station was amazing! Lot of people were already in the village and even more around the aid station. They were cheering on the incoming runners. At that aid station I again could eat a lot. I refused the pasta one volunteer offered because I didn‚Äôt know how I would react to eat. But I refilled with other food.

27 km (16.7 miles) would be left until the finish from that point. I could now see how I could finish it. And I felt better again. Probably because it wasn‚Äôt warm anymore and the last three sections should not have much climbing and descents compared to before. Shortly after 18:00 I left this, favourite, aid station.

Tourrette-Levens ‚Äì Drap
Stats: 6.9 km, 179m+, 491m- (total 137.7 km)
(4.3 miles, 587 ft+, 1,610 ft-, total 85.6 miles)

I‚Äôve sped up. I knew that I had to be a bit quicker to be done before midnight and with a finish time of 34-35 hours that would be a great result. Some of those parts were a bit more runnable. But the downhills really continued to annoy me throughout. The difference was that I risked a bit more. My legs still felt very good and I just needed to concentrate to avoid any injuries that late in the race.

At 19:41 I‚Äôve reached Drap. My headlamp was already out in my running vest‚Äôs front pocket to be ready for the night. I didn‚Äôt waste much time and continued onto the second last section.

Drap ‚Äì Plateau Saint Michel / Villefrance sur Mer
Stats: 9.1 km, 488m+, 188m- (total 146.8 km)
(5.6 miles, 1,601 ft+, 616 ft-, total 91.2 miles)

The night started and so did another climb. This was a bit harder now. It was a single trail again and I just continued through the dark. I positioned myself behind two other runners to let them lead the way. Like that I wouldn‚Äôt loose too much energy on navigating and could just focus on moving forward. I‚Äôve shortly talked with them before reaching the last aid station.

Plateau Saint Michel / Villefrance sur Mer ‚Äì Nice ‚Äì Promenade des Anglais
Stats: 10.7 km, 120m+, 494m- (total 157.5 km)
(6.6 miles, 393 ft+, 1,620 ft-, total 97.9 miles)

Last energy refill: N√§√§k, some waffels, some fruits. But I didn‚Äôt want to spend much time here. There were around 10.5 km (6.5 miles) left until the finish line. And apparently a lot of it should be on the road and quite runnable according to the aid station volunteers. Well, what followed was a bit of road, but that was again changing to rocky trails shortly after that. They really didn‚Äôt make it easy for us!

The part before Nice had some stairs going downwards before one could hear the waves hitting the shore. Finally I was there at the sea! There were some annoying stairs again until one would run through the city. But also here it‚Äôs not all flat. At one point they send you up another road. Eventually you come down though and run alongside the shore. People were out there cheering me on and I could run this part. Running meant that I had an 8:00-9:00 min/km pace. On the Promenade des Anglais you reach the straight finish area. The crowd was still out there at that time. Probably not as many as when Courtney was going through that final section 12 hours before. But I found again a bit of energy and run towards the finish line before taking some steps over the line. I stopped my watch. I had done it! I finished my first 100 miler in 35:22:53. I was smiling and they gave me my medal, a glass and a towel as gift.

After the race
I sat down and called my girlfriend where I explained how it went. After that I answered some text messages. And headed over to the food stand. I wasn‚Äôt hungry, but took a tea. I knew that soon my body will probably shiver again. I put on my beanie and all the jackets I had. After the tea and picking up my drop bag I headed for the hotel. On the way to that some people were asking what I did. After mentioning 160 km they were in awe. I was quite happy to take a shower in the hotel and brush my teeth. My feet looked okay and had only about 10 blisters. Nothing serious and I planned to take care of them in the morning. Now the shivering really started and I quickly went under the bedcover and turned off the lights.

I got up Sunday morning and went for a brunch. I didn‚Äôt sleep well. Probably still too much going on in my body. The flight back was planned for Monday afternoon. Because I didn‚Äôt know originally how it would go. It could have been that I only reach the finish line around cut off time on Sunday 12:30. I felt good and even walking was fine. I was quite cautious with my stomach but didn‚Äôt experience any issue and even went for a Pizza in the early afternoon and some pastry later.

Conclusion
35:22:53 in my first 100 miler. Strava (or rather Garmin) was coming up with 165.84 km (103 miles) and 8‚Äô561 m (28,087 ft) of elevation gain. Total descent was apparently 10‚Äô164 m (33,346 ft). This was partly due to the GPS mode not being that accurate and partly because I‚Äôve never really sat down at aid stations but often times was walking around. In the end I was ranked 178 out of 399 finishers and 576 starters. I think this is a great result for a first 100 miler.

Things I noted down for me:
- I need to make sure to have a proper stomach state already at the start.
- My bag pack was too heavy compared to others and I have to check what I can reduce in terms of equipment and food.
- Several times I mentioned that the downhills were annoying and technical. The course really is like it is and there‚Äôs no way around that. I have to train downhills more often. I‚Äôve almost never did specific downhill training.
- If in doubt, I should rather use a newer shoe in the future and one that is a little bit larger.
- Now I know how I do in a 100 miler. And there‚Äôs certainly potential to go a little bit faster next time

When this happened, we were at the a lake house that we rented for a week to take a vacation. The house had 6 beds, and 4 couches. There was two long couches. But because of medical issues, my mom and middle sisters could or would be out there all night because they didnt feel good. So that wasn't a option. But we were also down by two beds as the upper levels of the bunks were too sketchy that none of us felt comfortable to climb the latters to go up. Even I didnt want too, and im young and agile. (prefer to not state my age.) And for once I had my own room for a night! One. Night.

People Came in this order Me, My Mom and Middle sister (on day 1 of 7)

My Eldest Sister and her husband (On day 2 of 7)

My Cat obsessed uncle (on day 3 of 7)

My coffee addict auntie (on Night 4 or 5 of 7)

Now, to add more context, my Mom, Aunt, and Uncle, all either don't know, or do know that they are a bit disconnected from their emotions. My mom is the least disconnected. But she can still act a bit disconnected. But my Aunt has said some things that my mother has relayed to me, that have made my aneixty spike just from being arround her or being in her house. I have a anxiety that makes me very anxious about making mistakes or doing the wrong things. But she said something thats made my body image horrible to myself and though my family doesn't know this, but I've been having suicidal thoughts since I was 7 because of things in the past, specifically because of my body image issues and issues of my feeling like a failure. because of not only this, but my non-diagnosed anxiety, my non-diagnosed depression, some things my mom said to me as a 7 year old, and the final straw being the fact out of all the people I live with I am the most able as my Middle sister has a bad back, and my mom has two replaced knees, im the one who gets the most chores put on me. My mom and sister both do a lot of stuff too, but thats the reality of it. I am like Charlotte, a Recovering people pleaser. But I feel like im being pushed around and doing things as others push me around like a vacuum, sucking up everyones elses problems. My therapist even realized that I was a people pleaser and told me to start saying No...but I can't for the life of me.

Now back to the Vacation at the lake house.

Me, my Mom and Mid Sis all arrived first. Everyone planned to make a meal so we barely went off the lake house property. But we showed up and I had the bottom bunk of downstairs bedroom which had basically a man den. My mom had the master bed, and my sister because of earlier mentioned back issues, we had to bring a air mattress so she could control how soft or firm it was. But when my older sis and her husband came, they took the downstairs bedroom. So I went to the room my middle sis has and moved up there with her, which isn't a issue as we get along very well. (Im her Charlotte to her charlottes shark with a personality.) But when my uncle came, he got the master bed. And so that night my mom tried sleeping on the couch. But she was hurting so bad the next more that she was sleep deprived and I was kicked downstairs to the man den. Then my Aunt came. Me and her are about the same height, but im taller. Shes in her late 40's, and we tries to work it out. But I felt like I was gonna have a panic attack. As she went to finish grabbing her things and got ready for bed I cried and wrote down my thoughts. Unfortunately, it wasn't saved. The agreement we came too was I got the big couch that night, and she did the next. But I was honestly feeling really dejected, as I was trying to tell her all I wanted was this couch as as I didn't have many other options that I felt comfortable with. I JUST WANTED TO SLEEP ON THE COUCH! I told her it was first come, first serve. I honestly wanted my bed back, and my mom even offered after seeing how upset I looked. But I refused back I wanted her to be comfortable. The next night, when I was supposed to have the small couch. I asked if I could keep the big couch because we were both comfortable, but she expectedly said no, so I didn't push more and sucked it up. But it really ruined my vacation at the end as both my uncle and Aunt both left their messes for us to clean, and my uncles bedding smelled so bad it made me, my mom, and Middle sis want to throw up.

I love my Auntie, she normally nice. But I really just can get past this...

So am I the A-Hole for not wanting to share?

Also, for the things my mom and Aunt said to me:

My Mom said something along the lines of you need to loose 20 pounds. (This didnt include bone density) I was 7, and that basically destroyed my positive body image mindset. I was a pretty and good little girl. But that mentally destroyed me along with mental and verbal abuse from a narcissistic family member.

As for my Aunt, she said to my mom something along the lines of, 'How do you keep snacks in the house \[My Moms Name\]'? I can no longer go to her house or even friends without feeling body conscious and feel bad about eating more then 1 or 2 plates of food.",1,1728812979.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False

We've been building [Audiosmith](https://audiosmith.me/) for quite sometime now and we're excited about what you think. We are currently looking for feedback from the journaling community to continuously improve our app.

Audiosmith is a conversational journaling app that tracks your mental health. It works by having a conversation with our human-sounding AI (Like Samantha from the movie ""Her"") at the end of your day. After the conversation, it gets converted into a first-person journal entry that you can customize to your liking. The entry is securely saved and analyzed for mental health analytics. Based on your conversations, the AI develops a memory of you and can refer to old entries during your conversations. The more you use it, the more it can accurately assess your mental health and recommend specific actions to improve them.

We would like to know what you think about what we have built. I have attached a screenshot of its UI. Any feedback will be helpful. Thank you.

So a month ago he introduced me to his family, his parents were happy and we went for dinner at his parents a bunch of times in past 2 weeks, he told his parents that we both want to get married and his parents were supportive but asked if my parents knew, I told them that I didn't introduce him yet to mine but will do so soon

So a week ago I told my bf that I want to introduce him to my parents which would have been today

 but 4 days ago, his younger brother called me and said he wants to talk to me, he came to my bf's apartment where we both live, I gave him coffee and asked him what he wanted to talk about and he told me that my bf is not a good person and I should not get married to him, he said my bf has always been a womaniser he would smooth talk his way and use his looks to trap multiple women and always cheated on all of them and many women were heartbroken

I asked him if this is true he said yes, he told me that he used to do this when he was very young and he doesn't know if my bf cheated on me cause they no longer talk to each other but wants me to be cautious and he left after saying all this.

After thinking alot,I confronted my bf yesterday and asked him if all this is true, he said it is and said that he didn't tell me cause he was scared that I might break up with him and he didn't want to lose me, I told him that I need some time to think about our relationship and left to stay with my friend 

He called me like 20 times and sent me bunch of texts, he beg me to come back and he said that he regrets what he did but he can't change the past, he said he wants to marry me and he is changed if he wasn't in love with me he wouldn't have asked me to marry him

> i don't smell incense or wine enough irl to say if this smells like either of those things, and i'm not sure i can detect any hint of vanilla here, but whatever these notes are, they smell incredibly yummy. after finishing a full size jar of the sugar scrub, i also purchased superfreak in the room spray format, which has very low staying power, but did manage to rescue a secondhand eyeshadow palette from cigarette-scented hell (sprayed it on a tissue and left that on top of the open palette for a few hours).
>   
> 5/5, my holy grail. if i weren't stupid i'd stop experimenting with other seasonal scents and just keep repurchasing this

####‚ùß **macaron tower** / *tiers upon tiers of delicate french macarons in four flavors: pistachio, peach, raspberry and vanilla*

> literally just cotton candy gogurt. that's not a smell i love, but i don't particularly hate it either.
>  
> 3/5, i will finish this but won't repurchase.

# pumpkin butters
kind of scared of these after my first experience. as moisturizing body lotions, i think the formula is fine, but i've since learned i prefer those unscented, and at least to me, it's not really worth buying something like that at indie prices when merciful neutrogena exists.

####‚ùß **elderflower lemonade** / *bright california lemons and two varieties of sweet elderflower*

> in theory, this smelled good, but the fragrance was just so intense i couldn't even use it on my legs without getting a headache.

# perfume oils

####‚ùß **archipelago** / *toasted coconut, kola nuts, tamarind and jackfruit - all warmed with a light dusting of brown sugar*

>   
> 1/5. scrubber + immediate declutter

> vibes: a thirteen year old girl attending middle school in the year 2007
  
####‚ùß **bourbon & brown sugar cocoa** / *‚Üê it's all there in the name*

> chocolatey with a slightly offputting sickly sweet note. cannot detect any booziness. tbh it's giving private label store brand chocolate cereal. on drydown, the chocolate fades a bit and everything blends together more, into a sort of distilled eau de common cold.
> 
> not physically discomfiting, but does rocket me back to that time as a child when i got sick and threw up after eating a bunch of caramel popcorn.

> 2/5, some memories don't need to be revisited. immediate declutter

> vibes: ""we have cocoa puffs at home"" and other tragedies i don't want to talk about anymore
  
####‚ùß **bourbon espresso martini** / *fresh espresso, coffee liqueur and a shot of bourbon*

> what the hell, this smells exactly like kopiko coffee candies. coffee, a bit of chocolate, and i don't actually know what bourbon smells like but maybe it's lending a bit of warmth
> 
> 3/5, which is also how i'd rate kopiko, the second best candy available at my grandparents' house. might or might not declutter.
> 
> vibes: an office worker who refuses to break under their 996 work schedule
  
####‚ùß **depravity** / *clove, nutmeg lurk amongst the sweetest offerings of coconut, on a bed of rich golden amber, laden with dustings of sandalwood and spilled wine*

> a year ago, i would have said that this smelled dark, fruity, with a bit of something else i couldn't identify at the time. now, in 2024, it smells like a window cleaner they'd sell at trader joe's. i don't know how else to describe it; it's like, fruity with an overwhelming chemical smell.
> 
> 1/5, what happened to you. formerly a 4/5, but oh, the turns have tabled (???). tearful declutter.

> vibes: formerly, a morally ambiguous love interest in a secret agent movie. now, in the many years since, her actress has gone on to endorse questionable health supplements and behave strangely on twitter.
  
####‚ùß **litchi milk tea** / *tart litchi fruit and black tea met with a splash of coconut milk*

> smells like my favorite lychee coconut jellies, with the addition of some milkiness and something almost sour‚Äîmaybe that's the tea? i don't hate this, but i don't really want to smell like it either.

> vibes: a recent college grad with an extensive collection of novelty earrings. feels youthful but growing into sophisticated.

####‚ùß **odette** / *clean sun dried linens, tuberose, ginger lily and white mus*

1g2lvvg,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingadviceformen/comments/1g2lvvg/what_should_i_do/,What should I do?,"Hi so I would like to ask you for advice. I have been texting with one girl and we have been already on coffee etc. We are both studying at the same university so we have begin to talk firstly about school etc. During last exam season we were practically texting each other daily and same it was during the last month. She often send me selfies of herself like everyday, asking how I was etc. She also mentioned that we could meet at one party where both of us will be at 6th November and also mentioned that we could study together and foremost she also mentioned she would like to see my college room because she doesnt believe that I have there as big mess as I am saying often from jokes. Also she was a little bit jealous I would say because I mentioned that some people said that I am positive person. She then asked who concretely and I mentioned one girl who said it. She then asked why I am even talking about her and when I reminded that she asked she just sent smiling emojis. So with these indicators I didnt want to make the same mistake as I did last time (waiting too long) and I went with her on coffee in school cafeteria (day after the thing with the jealousy) and after that I texted her and I invited her to dinner. She politely rejected it.

So now to my question, what should I do? Let it be and move on? I was thinking about waiting cca 7-10 days if she reaches out and then ask her with just some friendly question. I am really confused from this behavior. Was it maybe because I pushed too hard?

1g2lsgv,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_CulturedNiichan/comments/1g2lsgv/the_smart_fridge_part_2/,The Smart Fridge Part 2,"""Guess I'll head back to my room, Ryou-sama,"" Yumi said.

Ryou nodded. ""I'll go on ahead. Don't be late,"" she said, placing a hand on Yumi's shoulder before turning to leave. Yumi was already starting to scuttle back towards her room when Sayuri emerged from her door once more. Another might have slammed it. But not Sayuri. She would not slam doors, just as she would never chew her food too loudly or laugh inappropriately or go out without a plan. That wasn‚Äôt the kind of person she was. But her steps were heavy, almost like a thump. Thump. Thump. She strode towards Yumi, who stood frozen in the hallway, watching as Sayuri advanced ever closer, face set and jaw tight, looking as though she had a few more words to share.

""Six thousand yen, Yakovlev,"" she said, hand outstretched as she stood in front of Yumi.

""Eh?""

""Six thousand yen,"" she said, ""for my breakfast.""

""What? Am I being like... shaken down like... in an anime?""

""'Am I being shaken down?' No? You are not. You are being charged a fee. A fee for ruining my breakfast. You see, my stomach, Yakovlev, has been accustomed to eating a breakfast of 800 calories. If I don't get 800 calories, it throws off my whole day. It makes me cranky. And since you've been so adamant on playing with live wires before I could even brew my morning coffee, you have, how should I put it mildly, screwed me over. Royally so.""

""But I only... I... already, it's fixed...""

Sayuri raised her finger, ""Sshh. Shh. Shhhh. Look pony up, and we can each move on with our lives. You can return to whatever the hell you do, and I can go back to trying to make it to class without a stomach full of rage.""

""I... don't have 6,000 yen.""

Ryou sighed, turning around, and walking back towards the scene. Yumi could be a handful sometimes, but it seemed like Sayuri here could match her pound for pound. ""Sayuri-san, that's enough.""

""Oh?"" Sayuri raised an eyebrow. Ryou didn't want to be Yumi's white knight. That would be patronizing, but Sayuri's attitude was really starting to grate. Yumi had already fixed the power. What was the point of holding a grudge?

""Maybe you could explain why you're demanding money from Yumi, if you please? We're having a bit of trouble understanding you. Did she steal from you?""

Sayuri shook her head, ""Of course not, but...""

Before she could continue, a door down the hall swung open and a figure appeared. The soft patter of bare feet on the carpeted floor preceded her. A figure in nothing more than panties. She walked with purpose, and with her came an air of simmering irritation, and maybe something else too, something less identifiable, as though her body radiated a certain heat.

Hana, her short bobbed haircut framing her pretty, expressive face. The petite build of hers contrasted against a figure of curves and generous flesh, the way her hips flared and breasts swayed as she approached, one hand firmly gripping a smartphone, the other pressing against her bare belly.

""So it was you, you twerp."" Hana said. She stood there in all of her glory, in nothing more than her white, laced panties, not showing a single shred of modesty, her chestnut-colored hair and fair complexion bathed by the morning sun. She pointed her smartphone accusingly at Yumi, her large, dark eyes locking on her. ""Gimme back my boyfriend,"" she demanded. Yumi blinked.

Ryou... Ryou found herself on edge. A bead of sweat ran down the back of her neck. Boyfriend? Yumi? What boyfriend? She had never seen Yumi so much as talking with a guy before, much less... much less having a... a... boyfriend!

""Gah? Eh?"" Yumi squeaked in response. Sayuri watched, eyes flicking between the three.

""I tune in to chillax with my bae and what happens? Gigabit goes poof. And who I find?"" Hana continued. ""You Russian nerd! Now I've got zero bars. Nada! And he was in the middle of it, too."" Hana looked like a bomb on the edge of explosion.

In the middle of what?? Ryou wanted to know, but didn‚Äôt want to know either. To her relief, if she understood Hana's ramblings correctly, she might mean Yumi was responsible, or so she thought, for her boyfriend's signal breaking up. Not anything else...

""Gimme back my Daiki-kun like right now, you little crab cake, or I‚Äôll cook you like chasu pork"" Hana stomped her foot, her breasts comically bouncing up and down with her gesture. 

Sayuri stared. ""Wait for your turn. She'll pay for my breakfast and then she's yours.""

""I'm freaking out over here 'cause I can't get in touch with Daiki-kun, and you're worried about your sunup grub?! I bet you scoop up tap water and call it your brekkie, cos y'know, it's free."" Hana made a gesture with her fingers as if she was rubbing two coins together.

Sayuri's face reddened. ""Well, maybe if you spent less time throwing yourself at boys and more time studying, you'd actually score higher than a 9-year-old in basic arithmetic. And I'll have you know water isn't free.""

""Rich coming from you, Miss 'I have a stick up my butt'!""

Sayuri's eyes narrowed, then a sly smile spread across her lips. ""How long until they kick you out, I wonder? A month? A week? Or maybe today, if you get yet another late violation, hmm?""

Hana's mouth twitched. She opened it as if to respond, but no sound came out. Her earlier bravado was all but gone.

""Oh, shitballs,"" she glanced at the time on her phone. ""Shit, shit, shit, class! When's class?"" She tapped the screen like a woodpecker. ""No, no. Why won't it load? No cap, Yumi-chan you better jigger this ASAP!"" she cried.

""Not before she pays for my breakfast!"" Sayuri was not letting go of her demands.

""Enough!"" Ryou finally raised her voice, the tension in the room finally getting the best of her. All three girls looked at her, startled by her uncharacteristic outburst. She took a deep breath, trying to compose herself. ""I'll go get your schedule, I've got a copy of everyone's in my room. And Sayuri-san, we'll hear your complaints after that.""

""But..."" Sayuri began to protest, but Ryou's glare silenced her. As Ryou turned to head to her room, Yumi's voice piped up.

""Um, Ryou-sama? Please, wait..."" Yumi called out.

Ryou stopped and looked back. ""Yes, Yumi?""

""Um... I just... I think... Hana-chan, gimme your phone,"" Yumi said.

""No freaking way, Daiki-kun is M-I-N-E! Get your own!"" Hana pulled her phone closer to her chest, shielding it from Yumi's outstretched hand. Sayuri just watched with an incredulous look. Ryou noticed her expression was becoming somewhat softer. Her posture relaxed a bit too, which Ryou found curious, but her attention quickly snapped back to Hana, who seemed on the verge of either a breakdown or an explosion, and who still hadn't bothered to cover up.

""C'mon, lemme see,"" Yumi insisted. ""I swear, pinky swear that I don't want a potato-faced boyfriend like yours‚Ä¶. like.... you've got nothing to worry about...""

Ryou almost choked at Yumi's blunt honesty. This girl just said whatever was on her mind.

""You... how dare you insult my bae, you gremlin! Potato-face? OMG!"" Hana seemed more bewildered than offended by the remark. Her phone-hugging became a tad looser. 

""I... ah... no, I... um..."" Yumi's attempt at backtracking was almost comical in its clumsiness, her cheeks turning red in embarrassment. ""Gimme?""

With a defeated huff, Hana finally handed the phone to Yumi.

As Ryou looked on, her junior proceeded to tap and swipe with the speed of a trained professional. She was mumbling to herself as her fingers danced over the screen. After a few seconds, a satisfied grin spread across Yumi's face. 

""West Wing, 12 pm. Room 208,"" Yumi declared. ""So... you're ok?"" Yumi extended her hand with the phone. Hana eyed it, then snatched it back, looking down to check it.

‚ÄúHow the actual fuck did you un-fritz my phone and get my deets? It was boop-de-doo, no signal, nuh-uh!‚Äù

""Uh, it's in the file system, y'see,"" Yumi's chest swelled a little, her hands on her hips as she began her impromptu tech lecture. ""You go here, and here, then here. These apps... they cache a bunch of stuff locally. The cloud is like a big lie. All these things that say cloud... it's just storage. Big lie,"" she explained. Hana was still staring at her phone and Sayuri was also leaning over, as if to confirm for herself the veracity of Yumi's claim. ""Oh, you might wanna delete this stuff from the trash, that's a lie too, it's just a directory..."" Yumi continued, ""but I didn't see any naughty pictures or videos, I swear, honest, no... no naked... things... no...""

Sayuri seemed like she might be holding back laughter now, while Yumi tried to dig herself out of the hole she was in.

""So you don't have to worry, Hana-chan,"" Ryou added, throwing Yumi a lifeline, ""and now, um, maybe you'd want to get some clothes on? Unless you plan on going to class... like this?""

Hana looked at Ryou and then down at herself. Her cheeks flushed. ""What... eyes up here, you Russian dweeb"" she snapped at Yumi. ""O-M-G as if you dorks ain‚Äôt seen a pair of perbazas before. Flatties,"" she scoffed, turning on her heel. She marched to her room and slammed the door shut, mumbling something about 'finishing up without Daiki'. Finishing up what, Ryou knew better than to ask.

After a few seconds of silence, Sayuri cleared her throat. ""Breakfast.""

""I don't have any cash,"" Yumi muttered.

""That's an issue.""

Ryou was getting tired of this back-and-forth. It seemed like Sayuri was just as stubborn as Yumi was, if not more so. ""Sayuri-san,"" Ryou interjected, ""if you explain why Yumi should pay for your breakfast, and if that explanation makes sense, I'll pay you. Does that sound reasonable?""

Ryou never made any promises she couldn‚Äôt keep, and as if to make good on her word, she took out her wallet, counting the bills inside.

Yumi looked at her, ""Ryou-sama, you don't have to...""

But Ryou held up a hand. Sayuri sighed, and her eyes met Ryou's. ""Alright. I'll show you. Come on to my room,"" she said.

Sayuri's room was... well, it was a room. There was nothing much to say about it, Ryou thought as she looked around. The only word that came to mind was 'functional', if one was feeling generous, 'soulless', if not. Her books were neatly arranged in a stack next to her bed, which was impeccably made. Her shoes, the few she owned, were all lined up in front of her wardrobe, sorted according to size. Not a speck of dust in sight. A single poster with a stock photograph of some mountain hung on one wall, the only concession to decoration in an otherwise bleak and utilitarian space. Even to someone as organized and methodical as Ryou, it was almost sad to look at.

Sayuri walked to the fridge, which stood there looking more like a spaceship than a common appliance, its chrome surface only marred by the presence of a touchscreen on its door. It wasn't unlike the one in Ryou's room - in fact, all the rooms in the dormitory had one like it. Yumi, ever the inquisitive one, started looking around, her hands reaching for the books. But Sayuri shot her a glare and her hands dropped, retreating back to the relative safety of her pockets.

""Go on, try opening the fridge and you'll understand,"" she told Yumi.

Yumi hesitated, her hand lingering over the fridge's handle as she glanced at Ryou. Ryou simply shrugged; it was probably the quickest way to find out Sayuri's complaint. And so Yumi shrugged in turn and pulled at the fridge door, or tried to. The touchscreen flashed, and the fridge door stayed firmly shut. Click. Instead, they were met with a chime and an enthusiastic, saccharine voice emanating from the fridge's speakers. ""Good morning, Sayuri-san! We are committed to providing you with the highest quality experience. To ensure your safety and satisfaction, we require a valid membership to access the contents of this unit.""

Ryou's brows knitted together in a frown. She should have known. These fridges, like all modern appliances, required a subscription. It was one of the many things that irked her about the modern world, where even access to your own food was gated behind a paywall. And she should have connected the dots when the bubbly Hana had thrown her own hissy fit over the loss of her Internet connection.

""Unfortunately, your Raijin SmartFridge Membership cannot be verified at this moment. This may be due to ongoing maintenance or network connectivity issues. To continue, please scan the QR code on the display with your Raijin Wallet app to verify or renew your membership. We thank you for your understanding and continued partnership. Should you need further assistance, please refer to our Help Center in the Raijin app.""

Sayuri's expression remained neutral as Yumi, visibly confused and frustrated, let go of the fridge door, which stayed shut, as stubborn and unyielding as its owner. ""See? That's why I need compensation. You must have done something to cut the Internet off,"" Sayuri explained.

""Uh..."" Yumi murmured, looking at the fridge door, then back at Sayuri. ""I was just checking the outlet...""

Sayuri shrugged as if to say, ""Case in point,"" but didn't offer anything else. Ryou took a step closer, examining the construction of the door. It wasn't Fort Knox by any means. Cheap plastic shell - but of course, cost-cutting was a thing. Compared to the Spark Frames they operated, this thing was junkyard material, just like every appliance made these days. The urge to reclaim control from this insufferable, smug piece of smart crap was almost intoxicating, primal. She imagined herself breaking the thin lock mechanism with a simple twist of the wrist, freeing Sayuri‚Äôs milk, cheese and fruits from their corporate prison. Before she realized it, Ryou's hand had moved, about to reach for the handle, her muscles flexing as if preparing for battle, but then she stopped.

""Ryou... Ryou-sama! Stop!"" Yumi called out, grabbing her shoulder. ""Forcing it might damage it beyond repair.""

Ryou looked at Yumi, then back at her own hand, and finally at the fridge. She took a deep breath, her hand returning to her side. She felt foolish. She wasn't going to break a perfectly fine fridge, especially not in someone else's room. If only she could meet face to face with the AI inside, she'd give it a piece of her mind. But then again, the AI probably had a piece of her mind already, stored in the cloud, collected by the swarm of smart devices all around them. It was an unsettling thought. one she preferred not to dwell on, hoping her relatively meager use of such gizmos might have kept her data footprint low.

Sayuri stifled a yawn, clearly growing disinterested in the situation. ""Look, forget...""

""Can I have a screwdriver?"" Yumi interrupted. ""Phillips head, number 1 or 2? Either is fine.""

""What the hell are you planning, Yakovlev?"" Sayuri questioned. There was a hint of genuine curiosity in her usually apathetic voice.

A conspiratorial grin spread across Yumi's face. She brought the hood of her hoodie over her head, pulling at the drawstrings until only her wide-eyed, mischievous face peeped through. The sleeves fell down, enveloping her hands like floppy gloves. Yumi raised one of those paws, pushing up her glasses as she announced, ""Let me liberate it!""

Sayuri blinked, Ryou stared blankly, and the fridge hummed silently.

""I beg your pardon?"" Sayuri managed to reply after a moment.

""You see... this is a Raijin Corp fridge, amirite? Raijin Corp uses this proprietary protocol called IntegrityLock (trademark) to verify the user's access credentials. Like... if you haven't paid it goes 'Fuck you', basically... and until it gets a signed certificate from Raijin, it's gonna stay locked tighter than a virgin‚Äôs cooch.""

Ryou's hand instinctively rose to her face in embarrassment. Sayuri just sighed and rubbed the back of her head as Yumi went on, picking up steam, her words coming in a machine gun like rapid-fire, her hand movements matching her speech as she animatedly continued with her impromptu tech talk, ""It's embedded in the hardware firmware, written in their own custom language, RaiLink, version 2.2.5 to be precise if your model's from last year, which I assume is the case given that we got our units back in April last year, yep, so it can't be easily modified. Theoretically. But!"" Yumi exclaimed. She skipped up and down, as if the floor had been electrified.

""So here's the tricky part... there happens to be a vulnerability that a certain someone might've stumbled upon completely by accident. As in, I-was-just-bored-in-class-so-I-spent-the-hour-poking-around-RaiLink's-leaked-codebase kinda accident. You see, there's a way to cause a socket exhaustion attack on the verification subsystem itself. It's kinda silly how simple it is. Basically, you generate tons of fake requests that overload the fridge's networking stack. Poof! A silly uncaught exception. And I know you will ask, but Yumi, wouldn't an exception just be caught and handled, or at worst restart the process?""

""I for one wasn't going to ask that,"" Sayuri murmured under her breath, as she massaged her temple. Just like Ryou, she didn't seem to be following most of the details either.

""Sure, normally it would,"" Yumi went on, brushing off Sayuri's comment. ""Except the verification subsystem does not gracefully handle this specific exception. Not in this particular stack. You know why?"" She didn't wait for an answer. ""Probably because this was being used only in development builds. So nope, a silly uncaught exception and BOOM, the system panics hard like... harder than... I dunno... uh..."" she trailed off, momentarily at a loss for a comparison, before her voice rose again. ""You get it... anyway! Next thing ya know, if you plug the kernel debugger and get this particular value onto the rax register and then just flip the second bit of this specific op, and... well, y'know...""

Sayuri looked at Ryou. Ryou looked at Sayuri. Neither of them had the faintest clue what Yumi was going on about, but her enthusiasm was contagious. Sayuri sighed. ""I surely don't. Could you please get on with it? Look, I'm not mad about my breakfast anymore. I'm not. Just please let me go to class and let this day be over."" Her shoulders slumped a little. Yumi seemed to be enjoying herself. She continued her speech.

""Yeah yeah yeah... well, point is, you then inject some custom code into its main firmware and... BAM! Full root privileges! Then as you may have already guessed, it's a matter of changing just a few bytes in the verification routine and BOOM! No more checking in to Raijin's mothership. Golden premium membership for life, baby! Ironic, all the functionalities were already built in, yup, yup, they were! Except, well, the fridge won't allow you to use them, not if you don't pay up.""

Yumi stood there, grinning, waiting for their reactions, her chest swelling with pride, while Ryou and Sayuri just stood there, their eyes darting from her to the fridge. Finally, Sayuri said, ""Are you serious?""

Yumi shrugged. ""Yes?""

""You tell me you can just pirate this thing? Is that so?"" Sayuri's disbelief was clear, but so was her growing curiosity. Sayuri took a step closer, scrutinizing the fridge as though it might betray her in some way.

""I need to get my laptop and hook it up to the serial console... you'd have to disassemble a panel, there's this port behind... but sure.""

""And I could like... cancel my membership? Save 24k yen per annum?"" 

""Yep.""

Sayuri seemed to be warming up to the idea, the corners of her lips curling ever so slightly upwards. Ryou watched with a certain sense of amusement as Yumi seemed to gain the upper hand in her odd confrontation with the normally uptight Sayuri.

""And nobody would know?""

""Nobody.""

""No more crappy ads?""

""Nuh-uh.""

""No more shitty notifications?""

""No more shitty notifications!""

""No more 'special offers' from Raijin's affiliates and partners?""

""Nope, nada!""

""And the milk, and cheese, and eggs...""

""...And oranges..."" Ryou interjected. Sayuri and Yumi turned to look at her. ""What?"" she said defensively, ""Oranges are important too.""

""Cold like the Siberian winter, baby!""

Sayuri's lips twitched, then curled into a grin. ""Well, fuck me.""",1,1728811205.0,u_CulturedNiichan,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôve never had body issues so this was a huge slap in my face. I moved on because whatever I‚Äôm doing this for me not him. Then last night he pretty much questioned me as a mom. He dies nightly put down with our son due to our daughter being clingy/colicky. Week he rushed it to play games. My son was up for TWO hours afterwards because my husband didn‚Äôt do the regular routine with him. So I went up there. I laid baby girl on her back on the couch SAFELY. I could easily peek or hear her if needed. My husband came upstairs and apparently picked her up. I got my son down and started going downstairs realized my husband had her. He looked up and said she was screaming. (Well I didn‚Äôt hear anything) He goes, ‚ÄúWell she spit up. No one was watching her. You‚Äôre welcome for saving her from choking.‚Äù He said it with attitude so I know it wasn‚Äôt a wrong play on words.

He says I don‚Äôt appreciate him but when I try he gets upset by how I want to show him. Because it makes him ‚Äúmad‚Äù when I spend his money. I‚Äôm a SAHM. When I ask for the bare minimum he doesn‚Äôt seem to take that accountability for more than that day. Aka don‚Äôt like Instagram or TikTok girls. He has said it‚Äôs the fantasy of them possibly talking to him. I try to ignore everything lately because I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs parental burnout. So I tried to give him a day to himself took both kids and he ended up doing ALL of the things I‚Äôve been asking him to do for MONTHS. I said thank you gave him a kiss and moved on because I just dont care to continue doing what we‚Äôre doing anymore. I‚Äôve tried telling him to get a therapist,words of affirmation, giving him space,having s*x when not in the mood. Do I feel appreciated no but oh well being a mom comes first and if I need to feel validation I‚Äôll buy myself a coffee because I earned it. Just over the childish behavior.

1g2lrit,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1g2lrit/alone_at_19/,Alone at 19,"Two years ago i was going out with my friends on my 17th birthday, the last two birthdays since then have been spent pretty much alone. Last year, i slept through my birthday because I hated myself and it felt like everybody else did too. My 18th birthday. I lost friends, I wasn‚Äôt acting like the best version of myself, my life was falling apart at home and i had nobody to talk to because i realised that those friends didn‚Äôt really care much for me beyond being a drinking buddy, my family weren‚Äôt concerned for my existence at the time either; my brother was having problems. I anticipated that I was going to spend my birthday alone long before it happened. I started telling everyone that I hated my birthday (I loved my birthday every year before that), i did it to have an excuse of why i was gonna be alone by the time my birthday came, and slowly before my birthday actually rolled around i successfully isolated myself, my friend out of the two left at the time, told me that she just didnt know what to get me for my birthday a few days after, after i blew my allowance on her gift just a few weeks before. Once my birthday actually came, i was in bed and just cried, and slept. My phone was pretty much quiet, i think only 10 people total wished me and that includes all the aunties in my family. This year, i still don‚Äôt have any friends. I have one friend from high school, but I‚Äôm pretty sure she just keeps in touch because shes a good person and she probably just feels bad. I have a fantastic boyfriend, but i think he also spends so much time with me because he pities me for having no friends. And i feel bad that I don‚Äôt. I tried making the best of my birthday this year. I thought about how im happy with just spending it with my family and my boyfriend, and im grateful because im actually getting gifts this year. I thought i would be okay without friends and not celebrating my birthday the way others my age would. But now that its here, I feel dread and teary eyed, that im still stuck here a year later, that nobody did really care in the end besides my boyfriend which sucks because I don‚Äôt want to depend on someone like that. Now i worry about taking my meds at the right time, going to therapy weekly, what im gonna bake next, if I want to go out for some coffee. Im only turning 19 but I might as well be 30. Still no friends, and i dont think anybody wants to be my friend. It was such a drastic shift going from someone who used to be semi popular in high school to this, maybe I ‚Äúpeaked in high school‚Äù, and i really tried to get better and meet people but all this is making me realise is how little i progressed since last year. I feel like a walking sob story. I was never made to be a sad person, but the past year has really broken my heart into pieces. ",1,1728811081.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

--------------------------------------------

Living in a mountain house can be a dream come true for many, offering a unique blend of nature and modern living. The charm of a modern mountain house design lies in its ability to seamlessly integrate with the landscape while providing comfort and functionality. Here are some key features of this architectural style that make it so appealing.

### Integration with Nature

A modern mountain house embraces its surroundings. Large windows and open spaces create a visual connection between the interior and the breathtaking views outside. These expansive glass walls not only bring in natural light but also help in reducing energy costs by maximizing sunlight. Imagine waking up to a view of snow-capped peaks or lush forests, all from the comfort of your living room.

### Use of Natural Materials

Modern mountain houses often emphasize the use of local, sustainable materials. These include:

- **Wood:** Timber beams and wooden siding add warmth and a rustic charm that complements the natural environment.
- **Stone:** natural stones for walls or fireplaces helps anchor the home to its landscape, providing a sense of permanence.
- **Metal:** Steel or aluminum roofing is not only durable but also gives a contemporary edge to the overall design.

The careful selection of these materials promotes harmony with the surrounding nature, making the home feel like a part of the mountain itself.

### Sustainability and Energy Efficiency

As environmental awareness grows, modern mountain house designs focus on sustainability. Features you might find include:

- **Energy-efficient windows:** These windows help to keep the heat in during winter and the cool in during summer.
- **Solar panels:** Harnessing the power of the sun not only reduces energy bills but also contributes to a greener planet.
- **Green roofs:** Installing a living roof can provide insulation while promoting biodiversity.

By implementing these sustainable practices, modern mountain homes can minimize their ecological footprint while maximizing comfort.

### Open Floor Plans

Another hallmark of modern mountain house design is the open floor plan. This layout encourages flow and connectivity between spaces, making the home feel larger and more welcoming. Common elements include:

- **‚Ä¢ Great rooms:** Combining the kitchen, dining, and living areas allows the family to interact and enjoy each other's company.
- **‚Ä¢ Lofted spaces:** These can serve as extra sleeping areas, offices, or simply cozy nooks for reading or relaxation.

Open layouts not only enhance social interaction but also improve air circulation throughout the house.

### Outdoor Living Spaces

Outdoor living spaces is crucial in modern mountain house designs. Many homes feature:

- **Spacious decks:** These provide a perfect spot for entertaining guests or enjoying a peaceful morning with a cup of coffee.
- **Fire pits:** Cozy evenings spent around a fire pit can create lasting memories with friends and family.
- **Hot tubs:** Imagine relaxing in a hot tub with stunning mountain views ‚Äì it‚Äôs the ultimate luxury.

These features enhance the overall mountain living experience, allowing homeowners to immerse themselves in the great outdoors without leaving their property.

### Modern Aesthetic

While maintaining a connection to nature, modern mountain homes often showcase a sleek and contemporary aesthetic. Minimalist designs with clean lines and neutral color palettes create a calming effect. Homeowners can personalize their spaces with pops of color or unique art pieces that reflect their style.

### Smart Home Technology

As technology advances, integrating smart home features into a modern mountain house becomes more common. You can find:

- **Smart thermostats:** Helping manage energy usage efficiently.
- **Automated lighting:** Allowing you to adjust light settings with ease.
- **Security systems:** Ensuring safety in remote locations.

These features enhance comfort and convenience, making mountain living easier than ever.

Modern mountain house design is all about creating a harmonious blend between architecture and the natural environment. With features that prioritize sustainability, comfort, and efficiency, these homes deliver a unique living experience that embraces the beauty of mountainside living. So, whether you're looking to build your dream mountain home or simply seeking inspiration, understanding these key features can guide you in creating a breathtaking space that truly resonates with nature.

Sustainable Materials in Mountain Home Architecture
---------------------------------------------------

When it comes to designing a mountain home, incorporating sustainable materials is key to creating a beautiful, eco-friendly space. With advances in technology and greater awareness about the environment, modern mountain house design can embrace nature without compromising comfort or aesthetics. Using sustainable materials not only helps protect the stunning landscapes around mountain homes but also enhances the durability and overall quality of the building. Here‚Äôs a closer look at some of the best sustainable options available for modern mountain architecture.

### Wood as a Sustainable Resource

Wood remains one of the most popular and sustainable materials in mountain home architecture. It's renewable, biodegradable, and provides excellent insulation. When selecting wood, consider:

- **Locally Sourced Timber:** Using wood from local sources reduces transportation emissions and supports local economies.
- **Reclaimed Wood:** This option not only boasts character but reduces the demand for new timber, minimizing deforestation.
- **Cedar and Redwoods:** These species are naturally resistant to decay and insects, making them ideal for mountain climates.

Additionally, appropriate treatment and maintenance can prolong the life of wooden structures, making them even more sustainable in the long run.

### Stone and Natural Rock

Utilizing natural stone and rock in your mountain home design can create stunning visual appeal while also being environmentally friendly. Here‚Äôs why stone is a great choice:

- **Durability:** Stone can last for generations with little maintenance, reducing the need for replacements.
- **Thermal Mass:** Stone has excellent thermal properties, absorbing heat during the day and releasing it at night, which assists in energy efficiency.
- **Aesthetic Variety:** From granite to sandstone, different types of stone offer unique textures and colors, blending seamlessly with the natural landscape.

### Eco-Friendly Insulation Options

Insulation is crucial in mountain home architecture, as it helps maintain a comfortable temperature throughout the year. Consider these eco-friendly insulation materials:

- **Sheep‚Äôs Wool:** Natural wool insulation regulates moisture and provides excellent thermal performance.
- **Recycled Denim:** Insulation made from post-consumer denim is not only sustainable but offers soundproofing benefits.
- **Cork:** Sourced from the bark of cork oak trees, it‚Äôs renewable and boasts great insulation properties.

By choosing eco-friendly insulation, you can minimize energy consumption, thereby reducing your overall carbon footprint.

### Recycled and Upcycled Materials

Recycled and upcycled materials into your mountain home can add a unique touch. Here are some ideas:

- **Recycled Glass:** Used in countertops, tiles, or decorative accents, recycled glass is versatile and visually appealing.
- **Upcycled Metals:** Repurposing metals like steel or aluminum for framing or design elements ensures less waste is produced.
- **Reclaimed Brick:** Bricks that have been salvaged from old buildings can be utilized for walls or paths, adding character and history to your home.

### Low-VOC Paints and Finishes

When finishing your mountain home, opting for low-VOC (volatile organic compounds) paints and finishes plays a crucial role in maintaining healthy indoor air quality. Here‚Äôs why:

- **Healthier Environment:** Low-VOC products emit fewer harmful chemicals, making them safer for you and your family.
- **Available Variety:** Many manufacturers now offer a range of colors and finishes in low-VOC options, proving you don‚Äôt have to sacrifice style.

By thoughtfully choosing sustainable materials for your mountain home, you can create a harmonious relationship with nature while achieving a stunning design. Remember, sustainability doesn‚Äôt mean sacrificing style; it can enhance the beauty and functionality of your home. Embrace this modern approach to mountain house design, allowing your residence to blend seamlessly into its natural surroundings.

### Conclusion

Modern mountain house design encapsulates a perfect blend of aesthetic appeal and functionality, emphasizing a strong connection to nature. Key features of these homes include expansive windows that invite natural light, open floor plans that foster a sense of community, and outdoor living spaces that extend the home into the breathtaking landscape. Each of these elements not only enhances the overall experience of mountain living but also showcases the natural surroundings, making the house feel like an integral part of its environment.

Sustainability plays an essential role in the modern mountain home‚Äôs architecture. By utilizing sustainable materials, builders and homeowners are making conscious choices that benefit the planet while offering durability and elegance. Materials such as reclaimed wood, bamboo, and locally sourced stone not only reduce the carbon footprint but also provide a unique character to each home. These choices help preserve the beautiful mountainscapes, ensuring they remain intact for future generations to enjoy.

When considering a modern mountain house, envision a space that reflects your love for nature while incorporating sustainable living practices. It‚Äôs about creating a comfortable, inviting home that doesn‚Äôt just coexist with its environment but thrives within it. The design of these homes speaks to a lifestyle rooted in harmony with nature, offering both serenity and adventure. As you embark on your journey towards designing or purchasing a modern mountain house, keep these principles in mind to create a space that's not just a shelter but a true sanctuary amidst the mountains.",1,1728811013.0,House1000Designs,0,1.0,False

For the first time in many years I've had a very unpleasant experience with smokers in the camino. Usually people are very considerate but not this time.

So I was with my group of people at a caf√©  terrace having a mid-morning coffee and snack. There were also some other pilgrims, not only my group.

An american guy (I'll call Eric) and his friend arrive to a nearby table and start smoking Cigars... yeah, not cigarettes, cigars. This goes goes for a couple of minutes with the people around them giving them the dirty look because everyone was uncomfortable with the smoke.

I decide to say this ""If you want to smoke can you please go elsewhere since people are eating?"" Eric looks at me and without comment looks elsewhere. I proceed to look at him and say ""Yes you"" (was a bit obvious since they were the only smoking.

Eric proceeds to make a scene ranting loudly and making everyone super uncomfortable and stays at the place saying that why he needs to move and not whoever is bothered by the smoke.

From then on, every time he crossed paths with us he would lodly yell ""hey buddy...."" in a threatening way. 

So just wanted to say. Please do not be an Eric, be considerate to the people around you, don't smoke close to people and please take your trash with you.



TLDR: Told a ""pilgrim"" who was smoking cigars mid morning at a cafe to please smoke somewhere people was not eating. Guy got aggressive and stupid. Didn't move.

Please smokers be considerate and understand not everyone wants to eat while breathing smoke. I know this situation is not the norm but just want to raise awareness. ",6,1728810941.0,CaminoDeSantiago,2,0.75,False

At 42, living in Denver, Colorado, I thought I had life figured out. I had a successful career in IT, a beautiful wife, Sarah, and two kids who kept me on my toes. But behind that picture-perfect image, something was missing‚Äîsomething essential.

I was exhausted. Not just the usual ""work's got me tired"" kind of feeling, but a deep, dragging fatigue that settled into every part of my life. I found myself skipping out on hiking trips with friends, declining invites to watch the Broncos play, and most concerningly, struggling in my relationship with Sarah. I wasn‚Äôt showing up for her‚Äînot emotionally, and certainly not physically. Our intimate life was hanging by a thread, and I could see the worry in her eyes, though she never pressed me about it.

At first, I chalked it up to stress from work. But when it started impacting my personal life‚Äîavoiding friends, feeling disconnected from my family, and shying away from even the simplest of daily activities‚ÄîI knew it was deeper than that. Sarah, ever patient, tried to be understanding, but I could sense her growing concern. And to be honest, I was worried too. Was this just part of getting older? Was my best self behind me?

One night, after another frustrating day of feeling like a shadow of my former self, I did what many of us do when we‚Äôre searching for answers: I turned to Reddit. Late into the night, I found myself scrolling through a men‚Äôs health forum, reading about other guys my age who were dealing with the same thing. Low energy, struggling relationships, a lack of confidence‚Äîit was all there. That's when I stumbled upon a thread about Boostaro.

It wasn‚Äôt just the typical ""miracle cure"" chatter. The men in the discussion were honest about their experiences‚ÄîBoostaro wasn‚Äôt some overnight fix, but something that helped them gradually reclaim their vitality. They talked about it like it was a slow-burning fire‚Äîsomething that, with time and consistency, gave them back the energy and connection they thought was lost for good.

Intrigued, I spent the next couple of days diving into research. Boostaro was an all-natural supplement aimed at improving blood flow, energy, and overall vitality. What really grabbed my attention was that it was designed specifically for guys like me‚Äîmen over 40 who were facing these exact challenges. I was skeptical, though. I‚Äôd tried other things before: energy drinks, different vitamins, even adjusting my diet, but nothing had worked long-term.

But there was something different about the way people talked about Boostaro. They mentioned ingredients like L-citrulline, which boosts nitric oxide levels, helping with circulation, and pine bark extract, which supports libido and stamina. It wasn‚Äôt filled with harsh chemicals or stimulants that would give you a temporary fix and then crash‚Äîthis felt more like a sustainable solution.

After thinking about it, I decided to give it a shot. Sarah didn‚Äôt know about it yet, but I figured, what did I have to lose? The first month didn‚Äôt bring any earth-shattering changes, but I felt a slight shift. I wasn‚Äôt crashing in the afternoons like I used to, and my mood felt a bit more stable. Sarah even mentioned that I seemed a little more present during dinner. Small wins, right?

[Boostaro](https://preview.redd.it/qcxhss4zsgud1.png?width=570&format=png&auto=webp&s=3044714b2a09b810e2f0f3c3ee6347023cdf7e8a)

By the second month, things got better. I was waking up with more energy and didn‚Äôt feel like I was dragging myself through the day. It was subtle but noticeable, especially when I wasn‚Äôt relying on that third cup of coffee to get me through meetings. Sarah and I were reconnecting more, too. It wasn‚Äôt just the physical side, though that had improved‚ÄîI felt more engaged with her emotionally. I could tell she noticed the difference. We started planning more date nights and even took a weekend trip up to Aspen, something I hadn‚Äôt felt motivated to do in a long time.

It wasn‚Äôt until around the three-month mark that I truly felt like myself again. My confidence returned, not just in our intimate life, but in every aspect of my day-to-day. I found myself looking forward to things I had been avoiding‚Äîcatching up with friends, going on bike rides with the kids, and actually enjoying time with Sarah. I had the energy and mental sharpness I‚Äôd been missing for so long, and it was clear that Boostaro had played a big part in that change.

What really hit me was a conversation I had with my buddy, Matt, who‚Äôd known me since our college days. He noticed the difference right away‚Äî‚ÄúDude, you‚Äôre like a whole new person,‚Äù he said during one of our hiking trips. I told him about Boostaro, explaining that it wasn‚Äôt some quick fix but a real, long-term change. He‚Äôd been dealing with similar issues, and I could see the wheels turning in his head. I didn‚Äôt hesitate to recommend it to him.

Fast forward to today, and Boostaro is still part of my daily routine. It‚Äôs not just about boosting performance in the bedroom, though that‚Äôs certainly a welcome perk. It‚Äôs about overall health‚Äîfeeling good, being present, and having the energy to live life to the fullest. Sarah and I are closer than we‚Äôve ever been, and my relationship with my kids has flourished too. I‚Äôm more involved, more active, and just... more of myself.

**For anyone reading this and feeling like I once did‚Äîstuck, drained, and unsure if things can change‚Äîtake this as a sign. Sometimes, all it takes is one step, one decision, to try something new. For me, Boostaro was that step, and I‚Äôm incredibly grateful for where it‚Äôs led me.** [**https://boostaro.com/**](https://freezegluco.com/Boostaro.html)",3,1728810548.0,healthysupplement_,2,1.0,False

1g2lmqg,https://www.reddit.com/r/adviceph/comments/1g2lmqg/pinalaglag_ko_ang_anak_ko/,Pinalaglag ko ang anak ko ,"Pinalaglag ko yung anak namin 

Ako ba yung gago? Dahil nag decide ako na ipalaglag ko yung anak namin dahil sa manyakis at kantut*ro na lalaki.  
 
Hindi nako nag dalawang isip na ipaglaglag yung baby sa tyan ko kasi hindi ko iniiexpect na mabubuntis nya ako. Pinipilit nya kasi ako makipagsex non nung nag kita kami. Actually hindi dapat mang yayari yon kasi akala ko nung mga oras na yun hindi yun ang habol nya. 
 Bago kami mag kita after ilang months nagka talking stage kami and nag dedecide na sya makipagkita sakin then ang choice nya lagi ay airbnb mag netflix lang and staycation setup. Syempre sobrang alarming nako nung ganon sinabi nya saken kasi alam ko mangyayari gusto nya is sex kaya gusto nya lang ng staycation. And nag decide ako na maging cold nako saknya dahil na turn off ako kasi unang kita palang gusto nya staycation. 

And nung followinh months. Nag patest ako ng hygiene ko (hiv gramstain, hpv etc) for my maintain health purpose lang nman yun then nalaman nya na nasa labas ako and nasa starbucks tapos sya malapit lang din. Nag dadalawang isip pa ko na imemeet ko ba to or hindi pero inisip ko non siguro balak lang yun makipagkita dahil gusto lang nya kumain kami or mag coffee. 

Pero hindi. 
 Nung dumating na sya pumasok ako sa car nya 
Almost 1hr kami nasa car nya and sobrang clingy nya 
Feeling jowa? Eh hindi na kami nag uusap or talking stage nung nag kita kami. Tinanong ko na sya kung saan tayo. Sabi nya gusto nya daw magpahinga kasi galing daw sya sa dagupan with friends pagod daw sya. And i ask him na sana nag pahinga nalang sya at di na sya nakipag kita if gusto nya mag pahinga. Nag reco ako na kumain kami sa labas like mga fast food tapos uwi nako. 
Pero ayaw nya. Pinipilit nya ako kasama na lambing niyayakap ako holding hands tapos na aawkward nako sa mga kilos nya. 
Sabi ko uuwi nako if wala ka maisip kung saan tayo. 
Tapos ang sabi nya. Mag buy nalang kami ng food tapos mag staycation nalang kami. 
Ayun nag alarm na saken na baka sex nga habol. 
Ilang beses ko sinabi saknya that time na ayoko makipag staycation gusto ko muna ng public place pero ayaw nya talga. 
Tapos sabi ko uuwi nalang ako. Pero ayaw nya so nag drive na sya tapos sabi nya ‚Äú ako na bahala san tayo‚Äù 

Then nakatulog ako sa kotse nya kasi ilang hrs din biyahe dahil sa traffic. 
And nagulat ako nagising ako nasa motel kami. 
Sabi ko bat nandito tayo bakit sa motel. 
Sabi nya mukha daw akong pagod saka sya rin kaya magpahinga muna kami.  
Di nako umimik hinayaan ko nalang hanggang sa pag pasok namin sa room. 

Then nag papahinga nako sobrang touchy na sya yung kamay nya umaabot na sa boobs ko. 
Sobrang uncomfortable kasi sobrang touch na nya saken hanggang sa umabot na hinalikan na nya yung leeg ko. 
And tinanong ko ano ba ang gusto mo prankahin na nya ako then pumatong na sya saken. And nauwi nga sa s*x 


After 7 weeks nalaman ko na buntis ako. And sya lang naman yung nakasex ko. 
Sinabi ko agad saknya na buntis ako at nabuntis nya ako 
Tapos ang sabi nya ‚Äúpaano ka mabubuntis eh sa labas yung pinutok‚Äù . Alam ko meron sya pinutok sa loob at nag precum sya and yung day na yun ovulate pala ako. 
And ang sabi nya ‚Äú for sure di akin yan‚Äù 
Pero tugma sa ultrasound result na sya yung ama kasi yung date na nag kita kami ayun yung date na lumabas sa ultrasound. 


So i decided na ipalaglag yung bata. Dahil wala nanan ama yunh dinadala ko at wala akong magandang trabaho hindi ko kaya buhayin pa sya. 

Hindi ko alam kung matatawag na rape ba yun or hindi kasi pumatos ako eh pero ilang beses nya ako pinilit pero hindi ko talga gusto. ",0,1728810459.0,adviceph,17,0.4,False

Last year i suffered a horrible one that had heart attack symptoms, that led to months of health anxiety and being in a fight or flight mode for weeks, it was horrible.
I recently started with panic attacks again after having Covid a few weeks back, but this time they are more like mini panic attacks. Last night i began feeling weakness and my body just feeling tingly and i knew my body was going into fight or flight mode again. I'm hosting a vendor event tomorrow for my dog mom group that i run, so i don't know if its because of the stress and anxiety about the prep, or if its because i drank a bunch of coffee today, and im not a coffee drinker because it messes with my anxiety (go figure) but yesterday i was craving a pumpkin spice. When i drink the ones from Starbucks, i don't get as anxious as the homemade ones.
Long story short though, my mini panic attack has carried into the night, it's almost 5 am and l've been tossing and turning, my heart feels like it's racing, and my mind is just in adrenaline mode. The worst is the vivid dreams being in a panic state. Does anyone else get it to where their panic attacks drift into the night??? I took a hot bath, i tried a cold shower, drank tea, did deep breathing, it settles down for a bit but comes right back.",1,1728810453.0,Anxiety,0,1.0,False

Part 2,"So, after that embarrassing but oddly funny first encounter, we started hanging out more. Her name‚Äôs Sarah, by the way. Every time we met at the gym, we‚Äôd joke about the leg press incident, and it kind of became our inside joke.

A few weeks went by, and we were grabbing coffee together more regularly. She was super easy to talk to, and I started to realize I might actually like her as more than just a gym buddy. But I had no idea if she felt the same way, or if she was just being friendly.

Then one day, after another workout, I suggested we skip the usual coffee and grab dinner instead. I expected a casual ‚Äúsure,‚Äù but she smiled and said, ‚ÄúAre you asking me on a date?‚Äù I got flustered, like totally caught off guard. I stammered something like, ‚ÄúUh, yeah‚Ä¶ I guess I am?‚Äù She laughed, and to my relief, said yes.

We went to this cozy little Italian place, and it was honestly the best night I‚Äôd had in a long time. We talked about everything‚Äîour jobs, the weirdness of moving to a new city, our worst dating stories (thankfully she didn‚Äôt bring up the gym incident again, haha). There was no awkwardness, no weird pauses, just‚Ä¶ easy conversation. And I could feel this shift, like this wasn‚Äôt just casual anymore.

As the night ended, I walked her back to her apartment, and for a split second, I wasn‚Äôt sure if I should go for the kiss or not. My mind was racing with ‚ÄúIs this the right time?‚Äù but before I could overthink it, she leaned in and kissed me.

Now we‚Äôve been seeing each other for a couple of months. We still hit the gym together, and every time we pass the leg press machine, she gives me that smirk, and we crack up all over again.",7,1728810381.0,stories,2,0.82,False

Ever since I can remember, she has ran a slander campaign against me which started from blogspots, facebook posts, twitter accounts and malicious rumours that were ever spread around the highschool started from her. She would make blogs about how I abused her verbally and physically. She wrote Facebook statuses about how I was cheap etc. She made twitter accounts called X (my name) is a B word. She told everyone at the school we went to that I had mental issues and that I was psychotic and she would tell this to all our extended family members as well.  All of this being completely untrue. 

She would sneak really bad pictures of me (back when I had gained weight and looked generally terrible) and send them to the men I dated and told them ""look how ugly she can get"". 

We live in the same house. One day I came home and noticed that she had thrown all my clothes that I was drying on the ground, she told me not to use the clothes drying rack as she had bought it. She then told me to pour out the coffee I had made into the sink because the cup I was using was hers as well. She then went into my room and took all the furniture out (pillows, duvets, chairs etc) and told me that she chose them too. In response to this, I called her the B word. She then ran to our housemates and told them that she was going to call the police on me for being ""crazy"" and ""psychotic"" and told the housemates to call the police on me too. 

I went back to my parents home in tears and swore i'd never speak to her again. She then called my mum (I overheard the phone conversation) saying that she ""couldn't understand"" why I was upset with her and it's like i'm trying to start issues where there aren't any. She has since blocked me on Facebook, Whatsapp and the phone etc. and told everyone God knows what. 

I have always been so good to her. I used to stay up till 6 AM doing assignments for her university coursework as she couldn't be bothered submitting them herself. This is one of very many things I have done for her.  
  
I've done nothing wrong to her but I don't understand her extremely intense hatred for me. The main reason I keep the peace is so my mother isn't upset at us fighting/disliking each other. ",2,1728810302.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

I have been texting with one girl and we have been already on coffee etc. We are both studying at the same university so we have begin to talk firstly about school etc. During last exam season we were practically texting each other daily and same it was during the last month. She often send me selfies of herself like everyday, asking how I was etc. She also mentioned that we could meet at one party where both of us will be at 6th November and also mentioned that we could study together and foremost she also mentioned she would like to see my college room because she doesnt believe that I have there as big mess as I am saying often from jokes. Also she was a little bit jealous I would say because I mentioned that some people said that I am positive person. She then asked who concretely and I mentioned one girl who said it. She then asked why I am even talking about her and when I reminded that she asked she just sent smiling emojis. So with these indicators I didnt want to make the same mistake as I did last time (waiting too long) and I went with her on coffee in school cafeteria (day after the thing with the jealousy) and after that I texted her and I invited her to dinner. She politely rejected it.

So now to my question, what should I do? Let it be and move on? I was thinking about waiting cca 7-10 days if she reaches out and then ask her with just some friendly question. I am really confused from this behavior. Was it maybe because I pushed too hard?

I often show partners to let them know I am aroused because I sometimes cannot even believe it.  My arousal often comes as we are having intimate conversations and not even talking about sex.  I‚Äôve even had such arousal during fights and shown a partner to demonstrate that I value that they are speaking their truth and that I appreciate that they are sharing and that I must feel safe in my body and to show that as much.

I recently had a first date where after doing a little impromptu dancing with them at their house after they invited me back I got a little excited.  Not at all fully erect.  She seemed to keep bringing up the topic of sex after, and after she said she didn‚Äôt like, ‚Äúbig dicks‚Äù and a story about how her friend brought her to a sex club I told her I needed to leave but at that point I was mostly hard.

Well, the second date we had coffee and I told her I had a dream about a woman pleading me to help her with men who kept parading around their erections, to which she told me she had fully noticed mine on date 1.  There were many other things on date 2 she also called out and I decided I did not want to see her again.

But it left me very insecure and embarrassed and scared she would tell other people as though I was inappropriate.  Of course I explained I don‚Äôt get an erection because I have some wild separate chain of thoughts in my head but it stems from natural feelings of connection and I guess being just a normal heterosexual guy, to which she said it‚Äôs not like I can see when her lady parts get wet.  She also asked why I didn‚Äôt do something with, ‚Äúit‚Äù,  and it was ambiguous if she meant to act sexually with her or to physically conceal my boner but since we were in eye contact the entire 1st date with our bodies visible to one another (there was no table between us above our legs hiding anything) besides awkwardly turning like a teenager to ‚Äútuck it in‚Äù or think unsexy thoughts while holding eye contact I did not see an opportunity to do anything.  I suppose I am a grown man enough I don‚Äôt care, and if a woman wants to tease me enough with sexual subjects then she‚Äôs going to have to own that it‚Äôs gonna produce arousal I guess, or so my logic goes.

However, this has now left me insecure.  I was out with friends and a woman who I hadn‚Äôt met showed up.  I basically asked her for advice on a subject she would know about at the end of our groups hang out and if she‚Äôd like to trade numbers.  I definitely felt attracted to her and after getting home I realized I got hard while facing her and asking her for her number.  Again not fully hard but enough that 100% in the right lighting it would have been obvious (the lighting was dark and so I have no idea if women notice this even in peripheral vision).  When I got home I again could see the pre-cum fully through my pants.

Is this normal?  Do other men experience this or women experience men getting an erection?  

As a man in his late thirties I‚Äôd much rather have this problem than a viagra problem, but I am wondering a bit now about it for the last handful of days!

I‚Äôm not inclined to think of this as problematic and to love myself, but in our era of Diddy‚Äôs I thought to check with the internet.  ",0,1728809692.0,dating_advice,10,0.25,False

‚ùì **Feeling unfulfilled despite a healthy lifestyle?**

In today's hyper-connected world, where almost every action we take is tracked and recorded, safeguarding your online presence has never been more crucial. Cybersecurity threats, data breaches, and privacy violations continue to make headlines, reminding us that the digital world isn't as secure as it might seem. This is where **private proxies** come into play, providing a robust solution for maintaining maximum security and anonymity online.

# Understanding the Concept of Online Security and Anonymity

Every day, countless individuals and businesses expose sensitive data while interacting on the web. From browsing and shopping online to conducting business transactions, our digital footprints leave behind traces that can be used against us. Online security and anonymity have become paramount, not just for tech enthusiasts, but for anyone looking to maintain control over their personal information.

With growing cyber threats, simply relying on conventional methods like incognito modes or standard security settings no longer cuts it. Data-hungry entities like hackers, advertisers, and even governments can easily intercept unprotected online activity, leading to potential identity theft, unauthorized surveillance, or data leaks.

# What are Private Proxies?

Private proxies are specialized servers that act as intermediaries between your device and the internet. When you use a private proxy, your requests (like opening a webpage) pass through this server first, which then forwards it to the target website. In doing so, your real IP address is hidden, and the proxy server‚Äôs IP address is used instead.

This feature helps keep your identity private and your activities anonymous. Unlike public proxies, which are shared among multiple users, private proxies grant exclusive usage to one individual or organization. This translates into faster speeds, better security, and‚Äîmost importantly‚Äîa higher level of privacy.

# The Key Features of Private Proxies

# Enhanced Security Protocols

Private proxies employ advanced encryption standards that shield your data from prying eyes. This encryption works similarly to how VPNs operate, tunneling your data through secure channels. Whether you're transferring sensitive business information or logging into financial accounts, a private proxy ensures that your data remains inaccessible to cybercriminals.

# Strict Anonymity

One of the primary reasons people turn to private proxies is the strict anonymity they provide. By masking your IP address, proxies prevent websites, advertisers, and hackers from tracking your digital footprint. You can browse the internet freely without worrying about leaving behind identifiable data.

This anonymity goes a long way in preventing tracking cookies and digital profiling, often used by companies to gather information about your preferences and behaviors. Private proxies allow you to keep a low profile, offering true privacy in an increasingly surveilled world.

# Exclusive Usage

When you use a private proxy, you're the sole user of that proxy's IP address. Unlike public proxies, where multiple users can slow down speeds and increase the risk of malicious activity, private proxies are reserved just for you. This exclusivity enhances both your browsing speed and security, ensuring that no other individual or company can exploit the same connection.

# The Benefits of Using Private Proxies

# Protection from Cyberattacks

In a world where cyberattacks like phishing, malware, and hacking attempts are rising, private proxies offer a reliable layer of protection. Since they act as a buffer between your device and the internet, they can block potential threats before they even reach your system. This is particularly useful for businesses handling sensitive customer data or individuals engaging in online banking or confidential communications.

# Bypassing Geo-Restrictions

Private proxies are highly effective at bypassing geo-restrictions imposed by websites, governments, or streaming services. Whether you're traveling abroad and want to access content from your home country, or you're trying to avoid state-level censorship, proxies make it possible. By selecting a proxy server in a different country, you can appear as though you're accessing the internet from that location, giving you unrestricted access to otherwise blocked content.

# Faster Browsing and Reliable Connections

Contrary to popular belief, private proxies can actually enhance your browsing speed. By offering exclusive access to a specific IP address, they minimize latency and ensure a more stable connection. Some proxies also offer load balancing features, which distribute your online activities across multiple servers, preventing overloading and maintaining fast speeds.

# Privacy for Sensitive Activities

For activities that involve sensitive personal or business data, private proxies offer unparalleled privacy. Whether you're handling financial transactions, managing confidential business communications, or accessing personal accounts, private proxies prevent outsiders from intercepting your data. This is particularly important for professionals who often deal with high-stakes information.

# How Private Proxies Work

# The Technical Structure Behind Private Proxies

At a basic level, private proxies are servers that handle data traffic on behalf of your device. When you request to visit a website, that request is first sent to the proxy server. The proxy then forwards your request to the target website, and the response is sent back to your device. All this happens without exposing your real IP address, ensuring that your location and identity remain hidden.

# Private Proxy Types

1. **Data Center Proxies**: These proxies are housed in large data centers and are known for their speed and reliability. They offer robust performance but might be easier for websites to detect.
2. **Residential Proxies**: These proxies use real residential IP addresses, making them more difficult to detect and block. They are ideal for tasks like web scraping and bypassing geo-restrictions.
3. **Mobile Proxies**: These proxies use IP addresses assigned by mobile carriers, providing an extra layer of anonymity. They‚Äôre highly effective for avoiding detection, as they mimic regular mobile users.

# The Role of Authentication in Proxies

Private proxies often use authentication protocols to ensure that only authorized users can access the proxy. This may involve username/password combinations or IP whitelisting. Authentication helps prevent unauthorized users from accessing the proxy, thereby enhancing security.

# Private Proxies for Different Use Cases

# Proxies for Businesses

Private proxies are essential for businesses that require secure data transmission. Whether it's transferring sensitive customer information or managing internal communications, private proxies protect corporate data from cyber threats. Many companies also rely on proxies to facilitate remote working, allowing employees to access the company's network securely from anywhere in the world.

# Proxies for Individuals

For individuals, private proxies are a powerful tool for maintaining personal privacy. From online shopping to casual browsing, proxies shield your identity, ensuring that advertisers and trackers can't monitor your online behavior. They're particularly useful for tasks like downloading, where privacy is a top priority.

# Proxies in the Digital Marketing World

Digital marketers often use private proxies to maintain anonymity while conducting market research or managing SEO campaigns. This helps marketers gather accurate data without being flagged or blocked by websites. It also ensures that their campaigns remain secure, preventing competitors from gaining insight into their strategies.

# The Risks of Not Using a Proxy

# Increased Exposure to Hackers

Without a private proxy, your online activities are vulnerable to various forms of cyberattacks. Hackers can exploit weak connections, steal your data, and even gain access to your personal accounts. Case examples abound, where individuals and companies suffered major losses due to inadequate cybersecurity measures.

# Threats from Public Wi-Fi Networks

Public Wi-Fi networks, like those in coffee shops or airports, are notorious for their lack of security. These networks are breeding grounds for hackers who seek to exploit unprotected devices. By using a private proxy, you can secure your connection on public Wi-Fi, ensuring that your data remains safe from prying eyes.

# Data Collection and Privacy Violations

Many websites and apps collect vast amounts of data from users, often without their explicit consent. This data is used to create detailed profiles of individuals, which are then sold to advertisers or used for other purposes. A private proxy helps you avoid such intrusive practices by masking your real identity and keeping your online footprint to a minimum.

# Best Practices for Using Private Proxies

# Choosing the Right Proxy for Your Needs

Not all private proxies are created equal. Depending on your specific needs‚Äîwhether it's speed, security, or the ability to bypass geo-restrictions‚Äîyou'll want to choose the right proxy. Factors like server location, IP type (residential vs. data center), and bandwidth should be carefully considered before making a decision.

# Regular Maintenance and Updates

Just like any other digital tool, proxies require regular maintenance. Keeping your proxy up to date ensures that it remains secure against the latest cyber threats. This includes patching vulnerabilities and monitoring your proxy's performance to avoid slowdowns.

# Pairing Private Proxies with Other Security Tools

For maximum protection, it's a good idea to pair private proxies with other cybersecurity tools like VPNs, encryption software, and firewalls. By creating a multi-layered defense, you can significantly reduce the chances of a cyberattack or data breach.

# Conclusion

Private proxies are an invaluable tool for anyone looking to enhance their online security and maintain anonymity. Whether you're a business safeguarding sensitive information or an individual looking for a safer browsing experience, private proxies offer the protection and peace of mind you need in today‚Äôs digital world. As cyber threats continue to evolve, having a reliable proxy service is a proactive step towards securing your online presence.",1,1728809114.0,u_theonlineforyou,0,1.0,False

They source their beans from Coorg, India, where they use a meticulous process to ensure each cup is both flavorful and ethically sourced. It just feels good to know that every cup I drink is supporting local communities, while also delivering top-notch quality.

1g2la0b,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1g2la0b/introverts_and_anxiety_practical_strategies_for/,Introverts and Anxiety: Practical Strategies for Sustainable Wellbeing,"Introverts. Those of us who prefer calm situations and environments. We may enjoy socialising but we recharge by spending time on our own, we often enjoying getting lost in our own thoughts ‚Äì just enjoying being inside our own heads for a while. We tend to lean toward smaller, close-knit social lives. But let‚Äôs clear up a misconception: introversion doesn‚Äôt mean we‚Äôre anti-social. It just means we are at our best in situations that aren‚Äôt overwhelming.


Anxiety. The emotion that warns us when something threatening seems to be just around the corner. In moments of true danger, it can be life-saving: the foresight that there is trouble ahead, and those vital few seconds to get ready for it saved many of our ancient ancestors (while their peers perished ‚Äì unable to pass on their genes.) That‚Äôs one of the factors why we‚Äôre here today. But, when anxiety lingers beyond its intended purpose, it becomes not just tiring‚Äîit‚Äôs exhausting. If this sounds familiar, you‚Äôre definitely not alone.

Not all introverts experience anxiety, and you don‚Äôt have to be an introvert to struggle with it. But many introverts do. It‚Äôs a common combination, and knowing how to navigate it can make all the difference.


Signs You‚Äôre an Introvert with Anxiety‚Äîwhich ones do you relate to the most?
1. You Typically Overprepare
You think through worst-case scenarios in detail. It makes you feel more in control‚Äîbut it can also be draining.
Tip: When you find yourself imagining worst-case outcomes, think about a balanced ""most likely scenario"" scenario too. Give yourself permission to think about the ‚Äò‚Äôbest case scenario‚Äô‚Äô ‚Äì luck isn‚Äôt a good strategy, but take it when you get it! Thinking through these scenarios helps to bring your anxious thoughts back to a more realistic middle ground. This practice doesn‚Äôt stop your mind from thinking about risks but it does help add perspective.


2. You Tend to Overthink and Listen to Your Inner Critic
Introverts often have rich inner lives, which can mean their internal dialogue is active‚Äîsometimes too active. Anxiety amplifies this, often turning up the volume on self-critical thoughts.
Tip: Develop a ritual for challenging anxious thoughts. When a negative thought comes up, ask yourself: ""Is this thought 100% true?"" Most often, it won‚Äôt be. Questioning and even writing down these thoughts can give you some distance from them, reducing their power. If this is an issue for, look up my article ‚ÄòFrom Limitations to Liberation‚Äô ‚Äì it takes a dive in to tackling limiting beliefs. 


3. You Always Feel the Need to Be Busy
Anxiety often compels you to keep moving (it‚Äôs a high energy ‚Äòstate‚Äô ‚Äì one of the reasons it can be so tiring)‚Äîconstantly doing something. But staying busy can sometimes just mean staying distracted, without actually being effective.
Tip: Replace ""busy"" with ""purposeful."" Each day, set just one or two specific goals that really matter to you. A small amount of focused effort is often more satisfying (and less stressful) than a day spent rushing from one task to the next with no real direction. Ask yourself at least five times a day: ‚Äòwhat is the most value adding thing (in the context of what your life is about) I could be doing right now?‚Äô


4. You Prefer Routines and Struggle When Things Go Off-Plan
Routines give a sense of control, but sometimes they turn into rigid safety nets ‚Äì sometimes beyond them being value adding. When something unexpected happens, it can trigger deep unease.
Tip: Practice gentle flexibility. Start small: maybe change the route you walk or try a new caf√©. These small ""novelty exercises"" help build resilience for when larger, unexpected changes occur. The key is to show yourself that change, is often manageable. Remember that change is neither good or bad (change can also be for the better). Remember also that we have been ‚Äòprogrammed‚Äô by our evolution to perceive change as bad: once we transcend that ‚Äòprogramming‚Äô new avenues of opportunity open up for us.  


5. You Hide Nervousness Behind a Mask
You‚Äôve learned to mask nervousness well, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not taking a toll internally.
Tip: Identify trusted people who you can be honest with. Even if it‚Äôs just one close friend or a journal entry, letting out what you're feeling helps you process the anxiety instead of holding it all in. Vulnerability is powerful; it connects you to others and often takes the edge off anxiety.


6. You See More Danger Than Others in Everyday Situations
Anxiety primes your mind to be vigilant (and reduces your options ‚Äì see my article ‚ÄòLive the life you choose ‚Äì expand your Thought-Action Repertoire‚Äô), sometimes turning neutral situations into seemingly threatening ones.
Tip: Try reframing the ""threat."" If you‚Äôre anxious before a social event, instead of focusing on what could go wrong, set a small, achievable goal for the event‚Äîlike having a meaningful conversation with one person. Reframing your focus can help your mind move away from perceived threats and toward positive intentions.


7. Perfectionism and People-Pleasing
Perfectionism often stems from a need to feel worthy. Beliefs like ‚ÄúI need everyone to like me to be valuable‚Äù create intense anxiety around how you‚Äôre perceived.
Tip: Shift from a focus on being liked to being authentic (are you living your life for you or for ‚Äòthem‚Äô?) Practice saying ""no"" in low-stakes situations. Remember, you‚Äôre not responsible for everyone else‚Äôs happiness: you are responsible for your well-being (not theirs!) The right people will appreciate your true self more than a perfected (according to who?) version of you.


8. Nerves Sometimes Turn You In to an Over-Talker
Normally, you speak only when you feel confident, but anxiety can shift you into overdrive, where you say too much to fill the silence.
Tip: If you catch yourself over-talking, pause and take a deep breath. Silence can feel awkward, but it‚Äôs not a problem. Giving yourself permission to pause helps reduce the pressure to fill every moment with words.


9. Trouble Sleeping
Anxiety makes it hard for your mind to shut off at night, leading to trouble falling asleep, frequent waking, or early rising.
Tip: Create a ""wind-down"" routine. Dedicate the last 30-60 minutes before bed to relaxing, tech-free activities. Reading something light, or writing down your thoughts can help signal your brain that it‚Äôs time to rest. Top tips (1) get as cold as you can (reductions in our core body temperatures are a cue to go to sleep) (2) forget the clock telling you it is ‚Äòlights out‚Äô time ‚Äì read until your eyes close and your head nods.


Moving From Awareness to Action
Being an introvert with anxiety can feel overwhelming at times, but it‚Äôs also something you can learn to manage with care and practice. Anxiety may not disappear overnight, but you can make shifts that help it lose its hold on your everyday life. You‚Äôre not alone. Many of us walk this path, learning how to balance the gifts and challenges of introversion and anxiety. Keep being gentle with yourself‚Äîthere‚Äôs strength in softness.


Practical Strategies for Thriving as an Introvert

1.	Create and Protect Your Recharge Time
For us introverts, alone time is essential for recharging. Make it non-negotiable. Whether it‚Äôs 30 minutes in the morning or a quiet evening ritual, schedule time just for yourself. Communicate this need with those around you‚Äîit‚Äôs a matter of maintaining your well-being, not just a preference.


2.	Leverage Your Strengths in One-on-One or Small Group Interactions
We tend to excel in deeper, more intimate conversations. Rather than pushing yourself to thrive in large social gatherings, seek out or create opportunities for one-on-one or small group interactions. You could host a dinner with close friends, or meet up individually for coffee. Cultivate the type of social life that aligns with your strengths.


3.	Prepare and Plan for Social Situations
One of the best tools for introverts is preparation. If you have a social event or a work meeting coming up, prepare conversation topics, questions, or think about what you hope to get from the interaction. This doesn‚Äôt mean scripting everything, but it does mean having some mental prompts to feel more comfortable and confident. You don‚Äôt even have to say much: a few thoughtful questions can go a long way.


4.	Create a Space at Home that Grounds You
Set up a specific space in your home where you feel completely relaxed‚Äîthis could be a reading nook, a meditation corner, or even just a comfy chair by a window. Use this space to do whatever helps you feel grounded, such as journaling, reading, or simply sitting in silence. Having a dedicated spot to return to helps to re-centre yourself, especially after having been with people.


5.	Harness Your Listening Superpower
Introverts are often strong listeners, and this can be a powerful skill in both social and work settings. Make it a habit to ask thoughtful questions and really listen‚Äîthis not only helps you navigate social settings more comfortably, but also makes people value your presence. Remember, quality over quantity is where you shine.

I can‚Äôt feel safe buying video games as I only really do it hoping to connect with people and talk about them. I still have more healthy, lasting joy and peace when getting outdoors and connecting with nature in solitude than the suicidal thoughts and tendencies that have plagued me since moving back into Dad‚Äôs house and subsequently buying an Xbox.

I once smashed an Xbox against Dad‚Äôs coffee table hoping to destroy it so I never touched it. In my lifetime I have deliberately and carefully shattered 5 screens with a setting pin and a crafting hammer‚Ä¶ because I knew the harm I was doing to my emotional and physical wellbeing. The only thing that‚Äôs getting me through this is therapy and reigniting healthy hobbies and lifelong active passions for skating, cycling and media creation and editing.

In childhood I never touched my game systems at Mom‚Äôs place. I never cared to‚Ä¶ I just photoshopped and edited on my PC  after about the age of 14. I had Asheron‚Äôs Call which played itself for my reality escapes into socially involved gamer community.

I had music. I had rollerblading. I had skateboarding. I had biking. I had art. I had poetry. I had writing. I had my cameras. These were all I ever needed. I felt serenity.

Gaming is and always was an intentional isolation tactic for a wildly active mind.

Translation / summary of the essential parts:

---

Satu R√§m√∂, a Finnish-Icelandic writer who is breaking readership records, has been visiting the libraries of her native country during the autumn, talking about her work and the fourth part of her Hildur detective series, which will be published in November.

She has revealed that Jakob, the partner of the main character Hildur, was inspired by a real policeman from the Ostrobothnia region (of Finland). She wanted (an excuse) to bring something Finnish to her series set in Iceland. Satu R√§m√∂ recalled a conversation she had had with a Finnish couple some years ago, who had told her that their foster child had worked as a police officer in Iceland for a short time in an exchange program. Jakob has appeared in all the books of the series.

The real-life Jakob introduced himself to the author in a surprising way.

When Satu R√§m√∂ was going to the Huomenta Suomi program (note: a morning show) in the spring of 2023 to talk about her latest book, fate intervened.

- I sat in the greem room of the TV studio and was anxious waiting for my turn to participate in the live broadcast. When the previous interviewees came out of the studio, a handsome, dark man comes and shakes my hand and states that ""I'm Sami, hello. I'm in your book"".

The man was Sami Isoniemi, a police officer from Ostrobothnia who was born in Kurikka and worked in Vaasa at the time.

When fiction and reality met, Satu R√§m√∂ felt like she was falling apart.

- A character from my fictional world was there. He had just come from the studio to talk about cooperation between the child protection services and the police. I was on my way to the same studio to talk about my book which covers the same themes and Jakob. This doesn't happen in real life.

R√§m√∂ says the after the broadcast she went for a coffee with Isoniemi to discuss what had just happened. During the conversation it emerged that Isoniemi had visited the police state where Hiludr and Jakob from the book series work.

The story makes Sami Isoniemi smile.

- It was a great opportunity to get to know Satu and realise that we sort of know each other, even though we don't. Iceland is a small country where impossible things become possible. I was there on exchange for six weeks and ended up becoming a part of a book series.

I'm experimenting with summarising Atom Habits in story form in order to make it easier to remember the concepts described in it. I would like to know what you think about this approach, and ways in which it could be improved.

Here are the first 5 summaries, one per chapter (1 through 5).

# 1. The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits

Emily was feeling stuck in her life. She often found herself making big plans for change, only to give up after a few weeks when results didn't come fast enough. One day, while reflecting on her frustration, she met an older woman named Margaret, who seemed to carry a calm wisdom about her. Emily shared her struggles with self-improvement, and Margaret, with a knowing smile, offered to help.

Margaret began by telling Emily a story about British cycling. In 2003, British Cycling was one of the least successful teams in the world. But a new coach, Dave Brailsford, changed everything with a simple approach‚Äîwhat he called ""the aggregation of marginal gains."" Instead of looking for big changes, he sought out tiny improvements in everything, from bike design to the riders' recovery techniques. These small improvements compounded over time, and soon the British team went from mediocrity to dominating the sport.

Emily was intrigued. Margaret explained that this principle applies to habits in everyday life. ‚ÄúImagine,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúif you could improve just 1% each day. It may seem insignificant, but over time, those small improvements would add up to something extraordinary.‚Äù

Margaret could see the doubt in Emily‚Äôs eyes, so she elaborated: ‚ÄúPeople often overestimate the importance of big moments and underestimate the power of small habits. The truth is, habits are like compound interest. Good ones help you improve, while bad ones can quietly pull you down.‚Äù

Over tea, Margaret helped Emily see how this could change her approach to life. ‚ÄúYou see, Emily, every decision, every small action, compounds over time. If you improve by just 1% each day, by the end of the year, you‚Äôll be 37 times better than you were when you started. But it also works in reverse: if you get 1% worse, you‚Äôll eventually find yourself in a much worse place.‚Äù

Emily began to grasp the idea. She didn‚Äôt need to focus on massive, sweeping changes but instead on tiny, consistent improvements. Margaret offered one more piece of wisdom: ‚ÄúThe key is to forget about big goals for now and focus on the systems you build around yourself. Systems are what lead to real progress.‚Äù

Margaret‚Äôs words hit home. Instead of aiming for grand achievements, Emily realized she needed to create small, manageable habits that could grow over time. Her success wouldn‚Äôt come from one big action but from many tiny actions repeated daily.

In the weeks that followed, Emily applied Margaret‚Äôs advice. She stopped focusing on drastic transformations and embraced small habits like setting her clothes out the night before for the gym, reading just a few pages of a book each day, and eating one healthier meal each week. Slowly, those small changes started to add up, and Emily began to notice the progress she had once thought impossible.

Whenever Emily felt impatient or frustrated, she remembered Margaret‚Äôs story about the British cycling team. Just as they had achieved greatness through tiny, consistent improvements, so could she. And with that thought, she kept moving forward, one small step at a time.

# 2. How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa)

Emily had been working on improving herself for a few weeks, following the advice of her mentor, Margaret, who had taught her the power of making small, daily changes. While Emily had seen some progress, she still felt held back by her deeper habits‚Äîthose old patterns that seemed to resist change.

One sunny afternoon, during a walk in the park, Emily confided in Margaret. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been trying so hard, but some things just won‚Äôt change.‚Äù

Margaret smiled, a knowing look in her eyes. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs because real change doesn‚Äôt just come from what you do; it comes from who you believe you are. Let me explain.‚Äù

She went on to tell Emily that true transformation happens at different levels. ‚ÄúImagine peeling an onion,‚Äù Margaret said. ‚ÄúOn the outside, you have your goals and results‚Äîthings like losing weight, learning a new skill, or getting a promotion. Most people think that‚Äôs where they need to start. But the real power comes from deeper layers. Beneath the results are your habits‚Äîthe things you do regularly. And at the core, you‚Äôll find the most important layer: your identity. That‚Äôs who you believe you are.‚Äù

Emily listened intently, trying to absorb this new perspective. Margaret continued, ‚ÄúMost people make the mistake of focusing on the outer layers, trying to achieve certain goals without ever considering who they want to become. If you want lasting change, you need to shift your identity first.‚Äù

Margaret then shared a story of a man who had a lifelong habit of biting his nails. He tried everything to quit but could never fully break the habit. One day, he decided to do something different‚Äîhe got a manicure. Seeing how nice his nails looked, he started to take pride in them, something he had never done before. From that point on, he saw himself as someone who cared about his appearance, and the nail-biting habit disappeared. It wasn‚Äôt about willpower; it was about a shift in identity.

The story resonated with Emily. She had always approached change by setting goals and trying to force herself to follow new routines. But now she realized that she had never truly changed how she saw herself. She wanted to lose weight and be more disciplined, but deep down, she still thought of herself as someone who struggled with health and motivation.

Margaret‚Äôs next words were simple but powerful. ‚ÄúIf you want to become the best version of yourself, you need to start with your identity. Instead of saying, ‚ÄòI want to be fit,‚Äô say, ‚ÄòI am someone who cares for my body.‚Äô When you start seeing yourself differently, your actions will follow naturally.‚Äù

Emily started thinking about her own goals differently. Instead of focusing on the outcome, she began to focus on who she wanted to be. She no longer aimed just to eat better or exercise more; she decided to see herself as a healthy person who valued her well-being. Every time she made a healthy choice, she was reinforcing that new identity. And with each small step, she was building a stronger version of herself.

Margaret reminded her that it wasn‚Äôt about being perfect. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need to do everything right all the time,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúEvery small action is like casting a vote for the person you want to become. You just need more votes for the new you than the old you.‚Äù

Emily took this advice to heart. She began focusing on small actions that reflected her new identity. Instead of forcing herself to work out or eat well, she embraced the mindset of someone who enjoyed taking care of herself. Slowly but steadily, the changes became easier, and her new habits started to feel more natural.

The real shift came when Emily realized that the power of change wasn‚Äôt in achieving a specific goal but in becoming the kind of person who naturally did the things she once found difficult. She wasn‚Äôt just someone who read books occasionally; she was a reader. She wasn‚Äôt someone who occasionally worked out; she was an active, healthy person.

As weeks passed, Emily felt lighter, not just in her body but in her mind. She no longer chased after big results, but instead, she embraced the daily actions that aligned with who she wanted to be. And with each day, she cast another vote for her new identity.

Margaret‚Äôs wisdom had given Emily a new lens through which to view her journey. The key to lasting change wasn‚Äôt just about setting goals‚Äîit was about becoming the kind of person who naturally lived in alignment with those goals.

And so, Emily continued to grow, one small habit at a time, each step reinforcing the person she was becoming.

# 3. How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps

Emily had been working on her habits, feeling progress but also sensing there was something she still didn‚Äôt fully grasp. One afternoon, during another walk with Margaret, she finally voiced her thoughts.

‚ÄúMargaret, I think I‚Äôm getting the hang of making small changes, but how do habits really form? I want to know how to make them stick.‚Äù

Margaret nodded knowingly. ‚ÄúAh, that‚Äôs a great question, Emily. It all starts with understanding how habits form naturally in our brains. Let me tell you about a psychologist named Edward Thorndike. He ran an experiment with cats. The cats were put in a puzzle box, and they had to figure out how to escape. At first, they stumbled around, trying anything, but eventually, they learned that pulling a lever would set them free. Once they figured that out, they began to escape faster and faster until it became almost automatic. That‚Äôs how habits work‚Äîthrough repetition, what starts as a struggle eventually becomes something we barely think about.‚Äù

Emily was intrigued. ‚ÄúSo, our brains make habits to make things easier?‚Äù

‚ÄúExactly,‚Äù Margaret smiled. ‚ÄúYour brain loves efficiency. Once it finds a solution that works, it turns it into a habit to save energy for more complex decisions. This process is called the **habit loop**. It‚Äôs made up of four steps: cue, craving, response, and reward. Think of your morning coffee, for example.‚Äù

Emily laughed. ‚ÄúI know exactly what you mean. When I wake up, I feel groggy‚Äîthat‚Äôs the cue, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúExactly,‚Äù Margaret affirmed. ‚ÄúThe grogginess is the cue, and what you want is to feel more awake‚Äîthat‚Äôs the craving. The **response** is making and drinking the coffee, and the **reward** is the feeling of alertness afterward. This loop repeats, and that‚Äôs why you do it almost automatically every morning.‚Äù

Emily nodded, finally understanding why certain behaviors had become so ingrained. ‚ÄúBut how can I use this to form better habits?‚Äù

Margaret paused, then began explaining. ‚ÄúThere are **Four Laws of Behavior Change** that you can use to make good habits stick or to break bad ones. First, **Make It Obvious**. To build a habit, you need to make the cue really clear. If you want to start drinking more water, keep a bottle on your desk where you can see it easily.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay, that makes sense,‚Äù Emily said. ‚ÄúAnd the second?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe second law is **Make It Attractive**,‚Äù Margaret continued. ‚ÄúYou need to make the habit appealing. For instance, if you want to exercise more, pair it with something you love. Maybe listen to your favorite music while you work out. It turns the habit into something you look forward to.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat could really help with my motivation,‚Äù Emily said thoughtfully.

Margaret smiled. ‚ÄúExactly. And the third law is **Make It Easy**. If a habit is too hard, you‚Äôre less likely to stick with it. Break things down. If you want to start reading more, don‚Äôt plan on finishing a whole chapter right away. Start with just a few pages. Make it easy enough that you won‚Äôt skip it.‚Äù

Emily laughed. ‚ÄúI always get overly ambitious and then end up doing nothing.‚Äù

‚ÄúMost of us do,‚Äù Margaret agreed. ‚ÄúBut starting small really helps. The fourth law is **Make It Satisfying**. Give yourself a little reward when you complete the habit. It could be as simple as crossing it off a list, which can be surprisingly satisfying, or treating yourself after a week of consistency.‚Äù

Emily grinned. ‚ÄúI like the sound of that.‚Äù

Margaret looked at her, her eyes twinkling. ‚ÄúAnd don‚Äôt forget, it works the other way too. If you want to break a bad habit, make the cue invisible, make it unattractive, make it hard, and make it unsatisfying.‚Äù

That evening, Emily decided to put Margaret‚Äôs advice to work. She wanted to cut back on her late-night snacking, which she knew wasn‚Äôt helping her. So, she moved the snacks to the highest shelf in the cupboard, making the cue invisible and the habit harder to follow. To replace it, she made drinking herbal tea attractive by buying a few new flavors she‚Äôd been wanting to try. Slowly, she noticed her cravings for snacks decreasing and her enjoyment of her evening tea growing.

With each day, Emily felt more in control of her habits. Margaret‚Äôs wisdom helped her see that it wasn‚Äôt about fighting herself but about working with her brain and making changes that set her up for success. As the weeks went by, Emily realized she was not just trying to form habits; she was actively shaping the kind of person she wanted to be, one small action at a time.

# 4. The Man Who Didn‚Äôt Look Right

Emily's journey to improve her life continued, and she was starting to see real change in her habits. However, during a chat over tea with Margaret, Emily admitted, ""I think I‚Äôm getting better, but sometimes I catch myself doing things automatically, and it feels like I‚Äôm not fully in control.""

Margaret smiled knowingly. ‚ÄúEmily, a big part of building habits is understanding that many of our actions are driven by instinct without us fully realizing it. Let me tell you a story about a firefighter I once knew. He was on a routine call, inspecting a building, when he suddenly got an overwhelming feeling that something was wrong. He couldn‚Äôt point to anything specific, but his gut told him they had to evacuate. Moments later, the ceiling collapsed in the very area where they had been standing. He couldn‚Äôt explain why he knew it was dangerous‚Äîhis years of experience had trained his brain to recognize the subtle signs of danger, even before his conscious mind caught up.‚Äù

Emily looked intrigued. Margaret continued, ‚ÄúOur brains are constantly learning like that, picking up on patterns until they become automatic. We do the same with our habits, forming routines that our brains execute without needing to think. To build new habits, we first need to become aware of these unconscious patterns and start to reshape them.‚Äù

Emily nodded. ‚ÄúSo, I need to figure out what triggers my habits?‚Äù

‚ÄúExactly,‚Äù Margaret replied. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about becoming more aware of what‚Äôs happening. Habits often become invisible to us, like grabbing a cookie without thinking about it. To truly change, you need to bring those unconscious actions into the light.‚Äù

Margaret shared a strategy called the **Habits Scorecard**. ‚ÄúMake a list of everything you do each day, no matter how small‚Äîwake up, check your phone, brush your teeth. Then, mark each one as a good, bad, or neutral habit based on whether it supports who you want to be. This helps you become more aware of what you‚Äôre doing, and awareness is the first step to change.‚Äù

Emily took Margaret‚Äôs advice and made her own Habits Scorecard. She noticed many little habits she hadn‚Äôt even thought about‚Äîchecking her phone first thing in the morning, which often left her feeling stressed before she even got out of bed, or eating snacks while watching TV just because they were nearby.

‚ÄúOnce you know your habits,‚Äù Margaret explained, ‚Äúyou can start changing them. There‚Äôs also a technique called **Pointing-and-Calling**. It helps to speak your actions out loud. If you‚Äôre about to eat a cookie, say, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm about to eat this cookie. Do I really need it?‚Äô Hearing it makes you more aware of what you‚Äôre doing and helps you decide if that action supports your goals.‚Äù

Emily liked the idea. She started trying it, saying her actions aloud, especially for habits she wanted to break. One night, as she reached for snacks during her favorite show, she paused and said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm grabbing these snacks, but I‚Äôm not actually hungry. I just want something to do.‚Äù That small moment of awareness helped her put the snacks away and replace them with herbal tea.

Margaret‚Äôs guidance was helping Emily not just to build new habits but also to understand and change the unconscious behaviors holding her back. She realized that creating the life she wanted wasn‚Äôt just about starting good habits but also about breaking the cycle of bad ones by becoming truly aware of what she was doing.

With each new day, Emily felt more present in her actions. She was not just on autopilot anymore but instead actively shaping her behaviors, one conscious choice at a time. And with each habit she changed, she felt herself moving closer to the person she wanted to be.

# 5. The Best Way to Start a New Habit

Emily‚Äôs journey of self-improvement continued with steady progress, but she still faced moments when her new habits didn‚Äôt stick. One afternoon, while sipping tea with Margaret, Emily confessed, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been trying to make time for new habits, but I often find myself forgetting or just getting distracted.‚Äù

Margaret smiled, ready to offer her next lesson. ‚ÄúEmily, the key to making habits stick is not just motivation. It‚Äôs about having a specific plan‚Äîa way to anchor those habits into your routine.‚Äù

Emily looked interested, so Margaret continued. ‚ÄúThere was a study done with three groups of people trying to exercise more. One group just tracked their workouts. Another received motivational information about the benefits of exercise. But it was the third group that saw the biggest success. They were asked to write down exactly when and where they would exercise, using a simple sentence like, ‚ÄòI will work out for 20 minutes on Monday at 5 PM in the park.‚Äô Over 90% of that group ended up exercising each week‚Äîmore than twice the rate of the other groups.‚Äù

Emily nodded, understanding. ‚ÄúSo, it‚Äôs not just about saying I want to do something. I need to have a clear plan?‚Äù

‚ÄúExactly,‚Äù Margaret confirmed. ‚ÄúThe technique is called an **implementation intention**. It helps you plan out exactly when and where a habit will happen. Too often, we say things like ‚ÄòI want to read more‚Äô or ‚ÄòI should exercise,‚Äô but we don‚Äôt specify when or where. The clearer your plan, the more likely you are to actually follow through. It makes it easy for your brain to know what to do.‚Äù

Emily decided to try it out. She wrote, ‚ÄúI will practice yoga for 15 minutes at 7 AM in my living room.‚Äù This clear commitment made it much easier to remember and act on.

Margaret went on, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs also a strategy called **habit stacking** that can help. Instead of just deciding on a time, you stack the new habit onto something you already do. For example, if you drink coffee every morning, you can add, ‚ÄòAfter I make my coffee, I will do five minutes of meditation.‚Äô It ties the new habit to something you already do every day, making it easier to remember.‚Äù

Emily loved this idea. ‚ÄúSo, if I‚Äôm already brushing my teeth in the morning, I could add something like, ‚ÄòAfter I brush my teeth, I‚Äôll write three things I‚Äôm grateful for.‚Äô It links it directly to something I never forget to do.‚Äù

‚ÄúExactly!‚Äù Margaret said, pleased with Emily‚Äôs understanding. ‚ÄúThe more specific you are, the better. The **habit stacking** formula is simple: ‚ÄòAfter \[current habit\], I will \[new habit\].‚Äô It works because it creates a natural flow‚Äîyour brain starts to associate one action with the next.‚Äù

That evening, Emily decided to put both ideas to work. She wrote down her plan: ‚ÄúI will read for 15 minutes after dinner at the kitchen table.‚Äù She also stacked a new habit onto her morning routine: ‚ÄúAfter I make my bed, I will do five push-ups.‚Äù It felt manageable, and she knew she wouldn‚Äôt forget to do it since making her bed was already a solid habit.

With each day, Emily found herself growing more consistent. Instead of relying on motivation alone, she was setting up her environment and routine in a way that supported her goals. Implementing these specific plans helped her remember what she wanted to do, and stacking new habits onto old ones helped them fit seamlessly into her life.

Margaret‚Äôs guidance made Emily realize that building good habits wasn‚Äôt just about determination; it was also about being strategic and practical. By using implementation intentions and habit stacking, Emily felt her new behaviors were starting to stick. She wasn‚Äôt just changing what she did‚Äîshe was becoming more deliberate in how she shaped her day, one small, planned step at a time.",1,1728807896.0,selfimprovement,0,1.0,False

The Bambino plus seems ideal for the fact it's just user friendly overall and convenient in a rush to get out the door in the morning, is also fast going straight to milk like the Barista pro), I can keep price down with the manuale or the Encore.  
  
That then leaves me looking at the Anna PID - yes it'll be slower generally to use but I'm getting the PID out the box and the impression I'm going to get a superior shot out of the thing.

For me it's coffee-shops with doors that you have to pull open when inside. If I'm potentially leaving with 2 or more cups of coffee, I should be able to push the door open as opposed to having trying to grab the handle with one finger without spilling anything üòÇ. 

What about ye?

By day three, I was already juggling two people‚Äôs worth of work while trying to learn new, complex systems with only the lightest of training. I also had to look after a friend‚Äôs pets after work every night, and it was my time of the month. So y‚Äôknow, it‚Äôs been a challenging week.

Last night I went for tapas with my partner, and after this week my mind helpfully suggested that I could have a glass of wine. It would be relaxing, right? I deserved it after the week I‚Äôve had ‚Äì it‚Äôll loosen me up and I can laugh and have fun with my boyfriend.

Well, I did not do it. I ordered a mango, ginger ale, chilli and grenadine mocktail. It was delicious, and I thoroughly enjoyed the tapas. We then walked home chatting on a beautifully chilly autumn evening, and when we got in we snuggled up on the sofa and watched a series we‚Äôve been enjoying (which I paid attention to and remembered all of). I had a great sleep and now I‚Äôm awake early, feeling bright and happy with the cat on my lap and a coffee while my partner sleeps in a little more.

I‚Äôm truly grateful, and comparing it to what would have happened if I‚Äôd had a glass of wine: after the first, I would have ordered a second. Drinking the wine would have taken priority over the food and I wouldn‚Äôt have tasted any of it properly. On the way home I would have bought another bottle of wine. I would then have been drunk and unable to follow the TV show, probably talking over it and getting sloppy.

To top it all off, I would have then passed out, slept badly, woken up hot, dehydrated and sweaty during the night and be feeling even more stressed, frazzled and tired this morning ‚Äì and not setting myself up well for week 2 of my job.

I think I definitely made the right choice. IWNDWYT! üíú",8,1728807424.0,stopdrinking,0,0.91,False

A few months ago I have been visiting your lovely country and I really loved your local coffee called ""AFRICAFE"". I was astonished when I was told that it is instant coffee. Unfortunately I have missed to buy a tin and now I am not able to find it here in Europe ... or just for horrible prices on ETSY or EBAY. Any hint would be very much appreciated.

So I decided to finally unbox my araku beans (mircoclimate) which have been seating idle for 10 days. 

Beans 21gm water 296 ml. 
Grind size (I made a mistake here ), used 9 clicks in C3. The grind was super espresso fine and I used around 99-98 C water preheated. 

Muddy looking coffee and a bit bitter. Guess we all learn from mistakes. Need to grind much coarser and lets see what would be the result.

Package \`hddtemp\` does not seem to be available.

Thanks.

EDIT: Solved.

Solution was to use smartmontools.

My mother became disabled a bit before I was born and cause my dad is taking care of her I had to grow up a lot faster. When I was 7 I already walked anywhere I needed (school, relatives, etc).

Although my parents were alright raising me, after a while I felt less and less seen by them, it was always my mom that was more important, and while I understand the reason why, it always bothered me, and for that reason I stopped seeing them as parents and saw them more like roommates.

When I hit my teens I started to be a perfectionist, I hated being even a minute late, I got disgusted easily with food, dirty dishes and stuff like that. I also grew up with a lot of anxiety and anger issues that got pretty bad over the years. Anyways, my parents are the complete opposite of me they are always late and they like the countryside more, that resulted us moving (I haven't disliked a place more in my lifeü•≤). 

Ever since we moved sth always happens to me, from seeing incects (my biggest fear) everywhere to always having to walk 2 km to get anywhere, which would be fine but a while ago I injured my knee and try to avoid long walks. So I'm mostly in the house or at school. These days I try not to notice things in my house that I'm too disgusted to even try to clean and I just try to watch organizing videos to distract me. So a few days ago my parents and I got into a fight (again), I don't even remember for what, and I told them that they won't be allowed to stay in my house after I move for college cause I don't want them to mess it up (ik maybe I went to far but I really don't want my house to have food on the bed)

AITA for telling them that?? (Sorry for my bad grammar btw)",1,1728807018.0,AmItheAsshole,10,0.56,False
