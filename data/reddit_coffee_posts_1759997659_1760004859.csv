Okay, hear me out! I‚Äôve always wanted that S** and the City kind of friendship circle in real life.
A gang of women who actually show up for each other for brunches, rants, heartbreaks, career wins, and spontaneous plans across Mumbai.

Most of my close friends are in different cities now, and I miss having that kind of energy where you can dress up (or not), grab water or coffee, laugh till your stomach hurts, talk about love, ambition, or just life in this crazy city.

If you‚Äôre someone who‚Äôs looking to:
- make genuine female friendships
- explore Mumbai together
- have unfiltered conversations
- be part of a supportive, ride-or-die circle

‚Ä¶then maybe this is our sign to start one.

Is anyone else here craving the same?

Let‚Äôs start a small, genuine circle of women who actually show up for each other. DM/comment what you think. ",1,1760004717.0,mumbaimeetups,0,1.0,False

I am moving to a new apartment soon that has no equipment and while I was planing on how to design my living room, I came across these stainless steel coffee tables that I think look amazing.

Their cost on the internet is out of my budget so I was planning on making my own. I already sourced the material and got an estimate on the cost of custom cuts and also different types of sheet(matte/reflective finish etc)

Below I attached two pictures for visualization. I have no experience with sheet metal so I was wondering on how can I construct a table like this. 

Is the table below made from one sheet, warped into this shape or is there some kind of wooden(or some other material) frame beneath it and afterwards they mount the sheets on it somehow?

How thick should the sheets be?

I am really eager on learning how to work with new materials but unfortunately I dont know anybody in my circle with this knowledge. 

I will be grateful for any kind of feedback.

In addition to seeing the landscape up close‚Äînot via a car window‚Äîyou can hear the road and smell the fresh air. However, you need a well-thought-out plan before you start your engine! That's where modern [**roadmap GPS motorcycle travel tools**](https://biker.tours/roadmap-touren/) come in. They are an easy, cost-effective approach to guarantee a happy, safe, and stress-free vacation.

Forget about fumbling with heavy, outdated paper maps that rip or get soaked in the wind. These days, we utilise GPS devices designed specifically for bicycles. These gadgets are durable, water-resistant, and have visible screens‚Äîeven in direct sunlight. They serve as your motorcycle's indispensable electronic road map. You can do much more with a competent GPS than merely find the quickest route. It assists you in locating the optimal routes. We're referring to the winding mountain passes, the serene back roads with less traffic, and the breathtaking views from the coastal paths. It assists you in finding unusual locations that you would never find by simply following a dull major road.

The key to an amazing trip is careful planning. A few things should be known in advance, whether of whether you're going on a short two-day ride or a lengthy, multi-week excursion. Where are you going to fill up? Where is the greatest place to get a quick lunch? And where will you spend the night‚Äîin a hotel or pitch your tent? It's simple to organize your complete tour in advance with today's roadmap GPS motorcycle travel devices. All of the places you wish to see, such as a unique coffee shop, a well-known landmark, or a cool viewpoint, can have individual ""waypoints"" defined for them.

When you plan ahead, you'll spend more time enjoying the journey and the sense of freedom on the road rather than spending more time stopped by the side of the road looking lost. Sharing your trip with pals is also made simple, and the GPS immediately reroutes you if you ever veer off course. Working diligently on your handlebars, it's like having a personal travel assistant who helps you plan your trips and keep to your timetable.

Therefore, avoid riding aimlessly. Get your gear ready, choose a great tour route, map out your adventure using a reliable GPS roadmap, and hit the road with confidence! At [**https://biker.tours/roadmap-touren/**](https://biker.tours/roadmap-touren/), you can find comprehensive instructions on how to get the most out of your roadmap GPS motorcycle travel planning and organize the ideal motorcycle trip.

Sophie and I (both 27) have been close friends since we were 4. We‚Äôre not the ‚Äúspeak every single day laurel/susannah‚Äù type friends, but I genuinely considered her a sister and her parents like an aunt and uncle. Our families are close. My whole family is invited to her wedding, as is my boyfriend‚Äôs family (my boyfriend is Sophie‚Äôs brother‚Äôs best friend). That‚Äôs how close we all are. So I wasn‚Äôt really surprised when she asked me to be her maid of honour and i think I‚Äôve been a good one. 

Well, two weeks ago Sophie, the other bridesmaids, and I went to try on bridesmaid dresses. I thought we all had a good time and that it was a successful trip as we found dresses. Apparently not really, because a couple of days later Sophie asked to meet me. She asked that I step down from being maid of honour. She said seeing me in the bridesmaid dress made her realise she just didn‚Äôt want me stealing focus from her and that she wouldn‚Äôt feel good standing up there knowing everyone was probably comparing us. I was so hurt, I admit I cried right there in the coffee shop. Partly because I never wanted her to think that anyone would be thinking anything other than that she was the most beautiful bride on her wedding day, and partly because I was just so excited to be up there with her and she was kicking me out over something that I couldn‚Äôt even control and wasn‚Äôt really true. So I said fine, it‚Äôs her wedding, if she didn‚Äôt want me up there I wouldn‚Äôt be, but I wasn‚Äôt going to come to the wedding as a guest when clearly my presence was going to be a burden to her. Sophie said that wasn‚Äôt what she meant, and I asked her to explain. She said she desperately wanted me there so she was going to put aside her feelings but she just wanted pictures at the alter to be with her looking the best and to have that moment with everyone looking at her up there. She also wanted me to tell everyone I dropped out because I was too busy. I said none of this felt fair and I wasn‚Äôt going to lie for her. I was a good friend and did nothing wrong and she was being a brat but that was her prerogative and I didn‚Äôt have to play along. 

I told my boyfriend about this who was pretty horrified, and agreed that if I didn‚Äôt want to go I shouldn‚Äôt (although he still is because he‚Äôs friends with the groom). But my mum and stepdad think I would be the AH if I didn‚Äôt go. My mum said it‚Äôs also been obvious that Sophie was insecure (I never noticed this) and that she can understand where she‚Äôs coming from. She said I‚Äôve had the spotlight our whole lives (again, I don‚Äôt think this is true! Sophie is far more outgoing and well liked than I have ever been) and even though it‚Äôs pretty sad, maybe she does deserve to be the princess on her wedding day and I shouldn‚Äôt hate her for it. She says I‚Äôll regret missing the wedding over this. My stepdad says I should go because she‚Äôs my oldest friend and even if she is being unfair, sometimes you have to let people be irrational. I really don‚Äôt know now. Sophie and I have so many mutual friends there‚Äôs not a lot of people I can ask about this without it getting back to her, so here I am. 

I feel like maybe I‚Äôm being a jerk having this blowup but I don‚Äôt see why I should even stay friends with someone who would exclude me from her wedding party over something superficial. And clearly she‚Äôs been sitting on these feelings forever. Not to mention I already paid for her whole bachelorette party and the bridesmaid dress and contributed to the cost of her wedding jewellery. And now I just feel used.

Selling more products in your WooCommerce store doesn‚Äôt have to be complicated. A [WooCommerce product bundle](https://www.themescaliber.com/products/wordpress-theme-bundle) allows you to group related products and sell them as one convenient package. This not only helps customers find what they need faster but also encourages them to spend more ‚Äî increasing your overall sales.

Think of it as a combo deal ‚Äî people love saving money and getting better value! Whether you‚Äôre bundling a phone with accessories or curating a skincare set, product bundles make shopping simpler and more rewarding for both you and your customers.

In this guide, we‚Äôll explain what WooCommerce product bundles are, why they work so well, and how you can create them to boost your store‚Äôs revenue effortlessly.



# What Is a WooCommerce Product Bundle?

A **product bundle** in WooCommerce is a way to sell multiple products together as one package. Instead of purchasing each item individually, customers can buy a set of related products in one go ‚Äî often at a discounted or special price.

For instance:

* A **laptop bundle** with a mouse and a bag
* A **skincare combo** with a cleanser and moisturizer
* A **breakfast kit** with coffee and a mug

These bundles make shopping easier, save customers money, and help you move more products.

Common bundle types include:

* **Combo deals** that offer discounts on grouped items
* **Starter kits** for beginners who need everything in one place
* **Gift sets** perfect for holidays and special occasions

With the help of [the best WooCommerce plugins](https://www.themescaliber.com/blogs/all/best-ecommerce-wordpress-plugins), setting up and managing product bundles is seamless ‚Äî improving both sales and inventory management.

Using product bundles can dramatically improve your store‚Äôs performance. Here‚Äôs why:

1. **Increase Average Order Value (AOV):** When customers buy a bundle instead of a single item, your revenue per order increases automatically.
2. **Enhance Customer Experience:** Bundles save customers time by offering pre-selected combinations of related products ‚Äî like a camera, memory card, and case.
3. **Clear Out Old Inventory:** Pair slower-moving items with popular products to move stock faster.
4. **Encourage Cross-Selling and Upselling:** When customers see a bundle of complementary items, they‚Äôre more likely to buy the full set rather than just one product.

In short, product bundles help you sell more while keeping customers happy.



# How to Create a WooCommerce Product Bundle

Setting up product bundles in WooCommerce is easier than it sounds. You can do it using [WooCommerce‚Äôs built-in features or plugins ](https://www.themescaliber.com/blogs/all/wordpress-cache-plugins)for more advanced options.



# Method 1: Using WooCommerce‚Äôs Built-in Grouped Product Feature

https://preview.redd.it/tthz4sjd32uf1.png?width=772&format=png&auto=webp&s=3559451f5ae1d5899c2c53e9901971b17fb4b5a1

This is a simple way to group related products without special pricing rules.

**Steps to Create a Grouped Product:**

1. Go to **WooCommerce Dashboard ‚Üí Products ‚Üí Add New.**
2. Under **Product Data**, select **Grouped Product.**
3. Add a title and description for your bundle (e.g., *Photography Starter Kit*).
4. Create individual **Simple Products** for each item (camera, tripod, memory card).
5. Go back to your grouped product, open the **Linked Products** tab, and add those items.
6. Click **Publish** to make your bundle live.

‚úÖ *Tip:* This method is great for basic bundles but doesn‚Äôt support discounts or dynamic pricing. For more customization, use a plugin ‚Äî just like how WordPress cache plugins enhance performance beyond default settings.

1. Go to **Plugins ‚Üí Add New**, install and activate your chosen plugin.
2. Navigate to **Products ‚Üí Add New** and select **Bundled Product** as the type.
3. Add the items you want to include in your bundle.

1o21py4,https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyShine/comments/1o21py4/evaluate_black_radiance_lipstick_to_see_if_bold/,Evaluate Black Radiance Lipstick to See If Bold Color Lasts,"**A Lipstick That Truly Works for Everyone**  

The Black Radiance 5071 lipstick caught my attention due to its reputation for catering to diverse skin tones. Being a person who loves experimenting with makeup, finding a lip color that not only complements my skin but stays put throughout the day is always a challenge. Excitedly, I gave this product a try during my daily routine, and it fast became a staple in my makeup bag.  

**Texture & Application**  
The first thing I noticed when applying this lipstick was the buttery texture. The creamy formulation glided effortlessly over my lips, evenly coating them without any tugging. Sometimes, lipsticks with intense pigmentation sacrifice moisture, leaving lips ridiculously dry‚Äîthankfully, this wasn‚Äôt the case here. Infused with Vitamin E, this product seemed to moisturize and soften my lips throughout use, making it comfortable to wear for hours on end.  

**Pigment That Doesn‚Äôt Disappoint**  
Pigment payoff is where many lipsticks fail, promising vibrant color but delivering something underwhelming. Here, however, the rich pigmentation was jaw-dropping. A single swipe of color was all it took to achieve full coverage, and the black shade ""Black Out"" lived up to its bold promise. Whether I'm hitting a late-night party or just spicing up my daytime look, it truly drenched my lips in impactful color with just the right hint of shine.  

[Ready to buy Black Radiance 5071? Click for Amazon pricing.](https://paulahansen.com/p/b07f7r1ljs/)  

**Durability & Staying Power**  
Let‚Äôs talk staying power‚Äîa headache for many of us who despise constantly reapplying. Wearing this lipstick during an entire workday, which included coffee breaks and a lunch where I shamelessly doused everything in ranch, impressed me. While some of the shine faded slightly, the bold pigment clung to my lips without settling into fine lines or bleeding outside the lip boundaries.  

**Winning Points**  
‚Ä¢ Rich, buttery texture that glides on effortlessly  
‚Ä¢ Vitamin E infusion keeps lips from drying out  
‚Ä¢ Full coverage with jaw-dropping pigmentation  
‚Ä¢ Lasts through meals and daily activities  

**Areas for Improvement**  
‚Ä¢ For those used to a matte finish, the shine might feel too much.  
‚Ä¢ The creamy texture, while hydrating, occasionally transfers onto cups or glasses.  

**Competing Products**  
Comparing this product to other budget-friendly lipsticks like Maybelline Color Sensational or L‚ÄôOr√©al Paris Color Riche, I noticed distinct advantages. Unlike the latter, which occasionally lacks even application, the Black Radiance 5071 lipstick had no streaking. In terms of moisture, it even rivaled higher-end brands, making it feel like a mid-level luxury product slapped with an affordable price tag. Of course, for fans of strictly matte finishes, alternatives like MAC Matte Lipstick might appeal more. But for anyone seeking creaminess with bold pigmentation, this is a standout choice.  

**Quality for Price**  
For its price-point‚Äîaffordable yet high-performing‚Äîthis lipstick surprised me with its ability to deliver features one would usually expect from pricier competitors. The versatility of shade selection and formula quality makes it ideal for buyers wanting budget-friendly beauty without skimping on quality.

1o21pgh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1o21pgh/how_do_you_ride_out_the_im_doomed_body_alarm_when/,How do you ride out the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm doomed‚Äù body alarm when tests are normal?,"My body keeps hitting the siren for no reason. Heart jumps. Chest feels loud. Hands go cold. Brain screams this is the moment. I do the hospital shuffle. Wires. Blood. Machines. All fine. Great news and somehow my head still thinks it is the end. The symptoms feel real while the papers say I am okay. That mismatch fries me. Nights are the worst. Early mornings too. I open my eyes and the scanner in my brain turns on. Every twitch gets a spotlight. After an episode I feel wrung out. Then I wait for the next one like a storm you can hear but not see.

I try little things. Slow exhale counting. An ice pack on my chest or neck. A lap around the block. Less coffee. No doom googling. Text a friend and say I am safe and this will pass. Sometimes it helps. Sometimes it just keeps me afloat.

If you get the same false alarms with clean tests how do you ride it out. Do you anchor on a phrase. Do you put a song on repeat. Sit up. Lie down. Stare at a clock for ten minutes. Let it wash over you. Trip it up early. What actually made the episodes smaller for you. 

If you are in it too I hope we both get a string of boring calm days soon.",2,1760003386.0,Anxiety,1,1.0,False

1o21obh,https://i.redd.it/nghhb62v42uf1.png,Support for My Pregnant Sister-in-Law After My Brother‚Äôs Death in Action,"Chapter 1



My husband's brother was an FBI agent, just like him. Half a month ago, he died in the line of duty.



Then my husband showed up at our door with his pregnant sister-in-law.



""My brother was killed in action during a mission. My sister-in-law is pregnant and needs someone to take care of her. As an FBI agent, I must ensure the safety of a fallen hero's widow and child.""



Martin Sam spoke with calm, unquestionable authority, like he was delivering orders at an operation briefing. As he spoke, he carried June's luggage into the house and led her straight toward our master bedroom.



I stood there, watching him open the door for her, arrange the bedding, his movements natural, as if all of this was perfectly reasonable.



And I‚Äîcould only watch coldly from the sidelines.



The first week, she was relatively quiet. The second week, she began to infiltrate.



She would stand softly at the study door: ""Martin, are you writing reports? You need some warm milk to relax your nerves.""



At dinner, she would suddenly clutch her chest, looking panicked: ""I feel like someone's watching me. Martin, could you help me check the security around here?""



In the middle of the night, she would call him into her room in distress, crying that she'd dreamed of someone breaking in, begging him to stay by her side.



When going out for walks, she needed Martin to stay close to her, or she wouldn't dare leave the house.



I'm no amateur‚ÄîI used to be a seasoned journalist.



I knew all too well how this kind of ""crisis"" was manufactured step by step. She carefully orchestrated everything, crafting herself into a ""helpless, constantly threatened"" victim.



The evidence was right before my eyes‚Äîone contrived coincidence after another, one deliberate cry for help after another.



But when I looked at Martin, there wasn't a trace of suspicion in his eyes, only patience and protectiveness.



""You need a stable environment. Don't overthink things.""



When he said this, his hand gently rested on June's shoulder, with a comforting pressure.



""If you're still worried, hold me tight, feel my warmth, don't worry.""



My heart clenched painfully.



How I wanted to remind him‚ÄîI'm your wife, not her.



But the words stuck in my throat, leaving only the sound of my heart pounding wildly in my chest.



Three years ago, I quit my job as a journalist at The Washington Post for our marriage. That was my stage, my former sharpness and edge, now dulled by marriage and domesticity.



I thought that by giving up interviews and pursuing truth, I could win his heart.



But now I understand‚Äîin his eyes, a woman wearing the identity of a ""widow"" is more worthy of protection than I am.



I walked into the study, my fingers ice-cold, and dialed the phone.



""Dad."" My voice trembled, yet was more resolute than ever. ""I want a divorce.""



...



On the other end of the line, my father was silent for a moment. As the head of a media conglomerate, his voice was low and stern:



""Karen, don't be afraid. Whatever decision you make, I'll support you. The James family's resources aren't meant to enable other people's ridiculous charades.""



After hanging up, my heart was surprisingly calm.



Perhaps because the disappointment of recent weeks had already worn me down completely.



I looked at the woman in the mirror‚Äîhaggard, colorless, nothing like the journalist who once dared to confront politicians and corruption with a recorder in hand.



But from now on, I would change.



That night, I slept in the study.



In the morning, I walked into the kitchen.



June was already there.



She was wearing Martin's FBI jacket, the oversized letters ""FBI"" printed on her back, as if silently declaring identity and belonging.



I knew that jacket all too well‚Äîevery time Martin returned from a mission, I would wash it clean and hang it up properly.



Now it hung loosely on June's shoulders. She was humming, making coffee.



When she saw me, she smiled slightly, as if nothing had happened.



""Good morning, Karen. I heard you slept alone in the study last night?""



I stared at that jacket, a dull pain in my chest.



My voice was cold, without inflection:



""Take it off.""



Her smile froze.



""What... what?""



""I said‚Äîtake off the jacket.""



My tone was like throwing the sharpest question at a press conference‚Äîcalm, cutting, with no room for evasion.



2

Chapter 2



Her eyes flickered, feigning innocence: ""I just threw it on casually... I thought it would be okay.""



Just then, Martin walked in.



Seeing June frantically unbuttoning the jacket, his face immediately darkened.



""Karen! What are you doing? Can't you see she's pregnant? She's already under enough stress!""



I laughed coldly: ""Of course I can see that. But I also see her wearing your most symbolic uniform jacket, putting on an act in my kitchen. She's not seeking comfort‚Äîshe's declaring her position.""



""It's just a jacket!"" Martin stepped forward, gripping my arm, trying to calm my emotions. ""Can't you be rational? June is a hero's widow. She lost her husband. Can't you have some compassion for her?""



""Rational?"" I jerked away from him. ""Martin, you're not her husband. You guard her room at night, comfort her 'nightmares,' help her check for supposed threats... and you call that rational?""



The air suddenly became stifling.



June's eyes reddened, and she gently placed her hand on Martin's arm, her voice trembling: ""I'm sorry, it's all my fault. I shouldn't have caused you to fight...""



She lowered her head, tears welling up, like an innocent victim.



Martin immediately protected her, glaring at me over her shoulder: ""Look what you've done‚Äîyou've driven her to this!""



""I'm only doing this for my brother. She's his wife. My brother died in service, and I need to protect his wife and child."" His voice was ice-cold, like making a vow.



Ever since June stepped into our home, he'd used ""brother"" as a shield countless times.



As if hanging the name of ""duty"" on everything could make me accept all the absurdity.



My heart was completely torn apart.



Years of patience and compromise collapsed in that instant.



""Fine."" My voice was cold. ""Then you can go fulfill your so-called duty. As for us‚Äîdivorce.""



Martin stared at me like he'd heard a ridiculous joke, actually laughing: ""Divorce? Stop being silly. What do you want? I can give you anything.""



June sobbed softly, saying quietly: ""Stop fighting, it's all my fault. I'll just leave...""



She stepped back, tears streaming, like a wounded deer.



Martin immediately reached out to stop her, his eyes panicked: ""Don't talk nonsense! You're not going anywhere.""



I spoke coldly: ""If she won't leave, I will. The divorce papers will be delivered to you by my lawyer.""



Martin's face changed dramatically, his voice low: ""Karen! Calm down. You're destroying everything we have.""



""Destroying everything we have?"" I laughed coldly, my voice sharp as a blade. ""Martin, you destroyed it with your own hands.""



I turned and left, picking up my phone to dial a number.



""Elaine, I need divorce papers. The reason is simple: irreconcilable differences.""



On the other end, my lawyer friend was silent for a moment, then replied coldly: ""Understood. Don't worry, I'll prepare everything.""

Chapter 3



I went back to the bedroom and started packing.



No longer the rule-following, meek woman Martin preferred.



In the mirror, a stranger was gradually awakening.



Flame-red lips, sharp eye makeup, a black slip dress underneath, a leather jacket on my shoulders that made me look cutting and unfamiliar.



For the first time in five years, I dressed like Karen again‚Äîthe journalist who dared to confront politicians at press conferences, not the shadow trapped in domesticity.



I dialed the phone.



""I need a drink.""



The bar's lighting was intimate, the music deafening.



When I pushed through the door, a familiar figure was already waiting.



Ethan‚Äîmy old partner.



He was my most trusted colleague back at The Washington Post, the only one who could work in perfect sync with me. Still wearing that casual shirt, sleeves rolled up, eyes sharp but softening with familiar concern when he looked at me.



He whistled: ""Now this is the Karen I know, not that shadow trapped in marriage.""



I tilted my head back and downed the drink in one gulp, my throat burning.



""Ridiculous, isn't it? I could expose political corruption, but I lost to a marriage.""



Ethan leaned closer, his finger lightly tapping my glass, his gaze fixed on me: ""You didn't lose. You were just trapped. As long as you want to come back, there's always a seat for you at the press table.""



I couldn't help but smile, though it was bitter: ""I will. I won't give up myself for Martin again.""



Suddenly his expression grew serious, his voice lowering: ""Karen, have you ever thought... that child might not be what you think it is?""



My hand trembled, and the glass slipped from my fingers, shattering with a sound like thunder in my ears, my heart suddenly contracting.



""Impossible."" I said quietly, but my voice was shaking, so weak that even I didn't believe it.



Ever since June entered our home, Martin's behavior had become increasingly wrong. Guarding her room at night, being constantly attentive during the day... what if that child really was his?



My chest tightened, the alcohol hitting harder.



I drank glass after glass until the world spun.



My last memory was Martin suddenly bursting into the bar.



He lifted me roughly from the booth, his eyes cold and furious:



""Are you crazy? Getting this drunk? Do you know how dangerous it is out here? And you're drinking with another man‚Äîhow dangerous is that?""



I struggled desperately, not wanting him to touch me. But the alcohol had completely sapped my strength, and I could only be carried away.



...



The next morning, I woke with a splitting headache.



Stumbling downstairs, the scene in the living room stopped me cold.



June sat in the center of the sofa, relaxed and at ease, as if this were her home.



She turned to look at me, a subtle smile playing on her lips: ""You're finally awake. Martin was so worried about you last night, carrying you all the way back to the bedroom.""



She stroked her belly, her tone gentle but sharp as a needle: ""Karen, you really should learn to depend on him.""



I stared at her, laughing coldly: ""Depend on him? What gives you the right to lecture me?""



Her expression changed slightly, but she maintained her fragile facade: ""I just... don't want to see your marriage fall apart.""



I stepped closer, my voice low but vicious: ""Like you depending on someone else's husband? Stop pretending. If you really didn't want our marriage to fall apart, you should get out of this house immediately.""

Chapter 4



Her smile instantly froze.



Without waiting for her response, I turned and went upstairs, pulling out my suitcase and slamming it on the floor. The sound of the zipper closing was like announcing the end of a marriage.



I dragged the suitcase out‚Äîhalf the closet was already empty.



All those clothes I'd changed for him, I left behind.



I only took what belonged to me.



When I opened the jewelry box, my breathing suddenly stopped.



The necklace my mother left me‚Äîit was gone.



It was an antique pocket watch pendant necklace, set with dark red garnets, with my mother's initials and the James family crest engraved on the back.



She placed it in my hands on her deathbed, telling me: ""This represents the James family bloodline and honor. You must guard it for life.""



But now, it was gone.



I frantically searched through every drawer, but found nothing.



I rushed downstairs.



In the living room, June still sat on the sofa.



Martin's arm rested behind her shoulders, the two conversing intimately.



Sunlight fell on her collarbone.



That necklace hung around her neck.



My breathing stopped.



""Take it off."" My voice was so cold it trembled.



June startled, then spoke gently: ""This is a gift from Martin. He said wearing it would give me peace of mind.""



I stepped closer, almost grinding my teeth: ""That's my mother's heirloom, with the James family crest. It's not jewelry‚Äîit's a symbol of my family's bloodline.""



Her eyes flickered, then she lowered her head, instinctively protecting the necklace with her hand, her voice falsely choking: ""But... Martin said he wanted to make me happy.""



I was furious. That was my mother's final gift, the only symbol of the James family. How dare she?



Martin immediately stepped forward to block me, his voice urgent: ""Karen! Calm down. It's just a necklace. I can buy you as many as you want.""



I stared at him, my chest heaving violently.



""You don't understand! It's not something money can replace!""



I moved to take the necklace from her.



Martin seemed surprised by my intensity. He blocked me while saying to June: ""June, give her the necklace.""



June looked at him with teary eyes and removed the necklace from her neck.



The necklace slipped from her fingers and hit the marble floor hard. With a crisp sound, the pendant's glass face cracked, fragments scattering across the floor.



The air froze.



I watched the necklace that once rested against my mother's heart shattered into pieces, my heart feeling like it had been carved out with a knife.



When I looked up, June's lips curved slightly upward, a hint of satisfaction flashing in her eyes.



I almost lost control, slapping her hard across the face.



She hadn't expected me to strike, instantly covering her face and letting out a sharp cry.



The next second, Martin's hand came down hard on my face.



My cheek burned with pain.



He roared in fury: ""How could you hurt June over a broken necklace?! How is it more important than her and my child?!""



I froze.



He had admitted it.



The child... really was his.



Pain and rage intertwined in my chest as I bent down, my hands trembling as I picked up the necklace fragments.



My mother's heirloom, the James family honor, destroyed completely by them.



I looked up, my gaze cold as a blade.

**This is how I crawled out of it.**

Not a growth hack.\
&#x20;A survival trick.

- I made a folder called **‚ÄúMe, but gentle.‚Äù**

- I dropped in 28 unheroic photos: bad kitchen light, bus stop glare, the hoodie that pills.

- I fed those into a _personal AI photographer_ that a ton of LinkedIn creators built for themselves because they were also out of photos.

- Training took about a coffee-and-a-scroll.

**Link (neutral, one time):** **looktara.com** _(I also tried the usual players: aragon.ai, headshotpro.com, photoai.com. Good for corporate pages; my face read more ‚Äústudio‚Äù than ‚Äúme.‚Äù)_

Then I made a rule for myself:

No lies.\
&#x20;No fake trips.\
&#x20;No ‚ÄúI woke up like this‚Äù when I clearly didn‚Äôt.

I just needed **me in a scene** that didn‚Äôt demand a friend or a studio.

***

#### **My tiny, anxious workflow (it‚Äôs boring and it works)**

- Prompts in plain English. No spellbooks.\
  &#x20;‚Äúme at a desk, late afternoon window light, candid, a little tired but present.‚Äù\
  &#x20;‚Äúme leaving a meeting room with coffee, hallway blur, soft overheads, untucked shirt.‚Äù\
  &#x20;‚Äúme at a whiteboard, mid-gesture, marker cap in teeth, warm office light.‚Äù

- **Keep flaws.** Pores. Flyaways. The jawline I pretend not to have.\
  &#x20;I add ‚Äúnatural enamel, not bright white‚Äù so the teeth don‚Äôt scream plastic.

- **Throw away** 30‚Äì40% without guilt.\
  &#x20;If it feels off next to a real picture of me, it doesn‚Äôt make the grid.

- **Caption honestly** when it‚Äôs not from a real shoot:\
  &#x20;‚Äúconcept shot for the feed,‚Äù ‚Äúmoodboard for next week‚Äôs talk,‚Äù ‚Äúscene I keep forgetting to capture.‚Äù

- **Phone still wins** for life: friends, mess, noise, sweat.\
  &#x20;This is just for: ‚Äúhey, I need my face for a post at 7pm.‚Äù

***

First week doing this, something weird happened.

Heart rate dropped when I opened the camera roll.\
&#x20;I wasn‚Äôt bargaining with my face anymore.\
&#x20;I was bargaining with **scenes**.

I posted three days in a row with my actual face.\
&#x20;Nothing glitzy.\
&#x20;Candid looks that felt‚Ä¶ allowed.

A client DMed, ‚Äúgood to see you again.‚Äù\
&#x20;Not ‚Äúgreat slider 6.‚Äù\
&#x20;**You.**

That‚Äôs what I was missing.

***


#### **For other anxious posters, steal my guardrails:**

- **Soft light words:** ‚Äúwindow light,‚Äù ‚Äúovercast daylight,‚Äù ‚Äúlamp light,‚Äù never ‚Äúglossy,‚Äù never ‚Äúporcelain.‚Äù

- **Human cues:** ‚Äútiny asymmetry, subtle eye texture, flyaway hairs, natural skin.‚Äù

- **Hands:** mention them if they‚Äôre in frame (‚Äúholding notebook,‚Äù ‚Äúmarker uncapped,‚Äù ‚Äúcoffee sleeve‚Äù).

- **Side profile:** add ‚Äúkeep jawline definition, minimal smoothing.‚Äù

- **Wardrobe:** name fabrics so they don‚Äôt look painted‚Äî‚Äúcotton tee,‚Äù ‚Äúwool blazer,‚Äù ‚Äúdenim jacket.‚Äù

I paid for it myself.\
&#x20;No affiliation.\
&#x20;Just a nervous person trying to post without disappearing.

And yes, I still skip days.\
&#x20;But when I show up, it‚Äôs my face.\
&#x20;Not a flawless stranger.

1o21lf6,https://i.redd.it/1ru0nq8842uf1.png,My Death Countdown,"""Ms. Rhodes, this is Dignitas calling. Did you personally apply for euthanasia on December 25th?""

Sylvia Rhodes's eyelashes fluttered slightly, but her voice remained calm. ""Yes.""

""Very well. Your application has been approved. You have two weeks to put your affairs in order.""

Just after Sylvia hung up, the bedroom door opened.

Her husband, Adrien Farrell, entered, letting in a sharp gust of cold air. Upon seeing her, he smiled and raised a delicately wrapped gift. ""Syl, happy birthday.""

Sylvia smiled softly. ""My birthday was yesterday.""

Adrien froze. A flicker of panic and embarrassment crossed his face.

""Sorry, I've been too busy with work lately.""

He squatted down and gently massaged her calves, changing the subject. ""How are you feeling today? Any discomfort in your legs?""

He pressed too hard, his slender hands turning red. Veins stood out on the backs of his hands, a striking sight.

His skill was undeniable, but Sylvia felt nothing.

When she didn't respond, Adrien looked up to ask, but his phone suddenly chirped in his pocket.

He pulled it out and glanced at the screen. The moment he saw the name, a smile spread across his face.

Whatever he'd been about to say was forgotten. He stood up abruptly.

""Syl, I need to handle something for work. I'll come back to massage you later."" Then he headed to the study.

Sylvia stayed silent, watching him leave.

Even after he was gone, his genuine, irrepressible smile replayed in her mind.

He'd smile wholeheartedly over work?

It must have been about someone he liked.

After all, she'd seen him smile like that many times before.

Every morning in high school, she'd hurriedly finish her milk and rush downstairs, and there he'd be, smiling just like that. He'd walk over, take her heavy backpack, and take her to school on his bike.

They were both 18 back then, young and bright, immature yet full of life. They were completely smitten with each other.

Their love story unfolded just like a romance novel‚Äîa bond nurtured over years of growing up side by side.

They dated in secret, keeping it hidden from both their parents and teachers. They promised to get into the same university and make their relationship public one day.

They pushed each other to improve. In the end, both scored nearly perfect on their SATs and were admitted to Harvard University.

Everything should have ended perfectly there.

But something unexpected happened.

Just one day before school began, they were in a car crash. When the car was about the hit them, Sylvia pushed Adrien out of the way.

He walked away unharmed, but she was left paralyzed from the waist down.

Misfortune never comes alone. That same year, Sylvia's parents died in a plane crash. She buckled under the weight of the blows and fell into a deep depression.

Adrien was heartbroken. Right after graduation, he proposed.

He vowed he'd never let her down.

He had kept his word throughout their three-year marriage.

But the truth was exposed two weeks ago when Sylvia found his diary.

The man who declared his love every day had been pouring out his pain in that diary.

He wrote that he'd proposed out of a sense of duty, fearing that otherwise, everyone would blame him.

He added that every time he came home, the heavy, suffocating feeling made it hard to breathe; every second he spent with her was a new form of torture.

He noted that if he could have a second chance, he would have chosen the wheelchair. To him, the physical suffering was a far lighter weight than the crushing guilt of her sacrifice.

He admitted that he'd fallen for another girl, Kiersten Tresham. She was vibrant, bright, and lively, just like Sylvia had been before the crash.

The next day, Sylvia got several messages from Kiersten.

""Sylvia, Adrien told me you'll never walk again. You've known each other for so many years. Can't you just let him go?""

""Do you realize he's been trapped in a living hell because of you? He wishes he were dead. But he can't because he has to put on a brave face and take care of you. How miserable.""

""If he hadn't met me, he might've lost his mind. Don't you feel guilty at all? I feel terrible for him. Besides, he loves me now. So, please let him go, so we can be together.""

Immediately after, Kiersten sent a dozen photos of herself with Adrien.

Smiling as he brewed coffee, he noticed Kiersten taking a selfie, leaned in, and posed playfully for the camera.

He peeled a whole plate of shrimp for Kiersten and wiped sauce from her fingers.

He followed her footprints on the beach, then brought her a handful of seashells, a beaming smile on his face.

By the time she finished looking at all the photos, Sylvia's heart hurt so badly she could barely breathe. It felt like it was shattering.

But her eyes had run dry of tears, a hollow emptiness staring back from them.

She didn't reply, but Kiersten didn't stop.

Every day after, Kiersten sent new photos, each stamped with a date.

On November 21st, Adrien and Kiersten walked together in the park as the sun set.

On November 26th, they went to a pottery studio and made a vase together.

On December 1st, they attended a concert, talking about music and their future.

The photos of them kept coming...

Each timestamp was a silent contradiction to Adrien's claims of working late.

Even on her birthday yesterday, Sylvia waited all day and night for him.

But he never came back because he was enjoying fireworks with Kiersten.

Looking at those photos, Sylvia smiled bitterly until tears spilled out.

Back when they were both 17 years old, Adrien had loved Sylvia with all his heart.

Now that they were 25, he didn't love her anymore.

That night, Sylvia sat by the window all night. The following day, she submitted all the necessary documents to an overseas euthanasia organization, resolved to end her life.

She thought, ""Adrien, you're all I have left.

""But you've been running from me.

""Then I will let you go and set myself free.""

Chapter 2

Sylvia sat alone in the living room for a long time. Only after dark did she wheel herself to the study and knock softly.

Adrien hurriedly ended his call and came out.

""Syl, I forgot your birthday. Since our third anniversary is coming up, let's celebrate both together, okay? Wherever you want to go, I'll take you there.""

Sylvia looked at him, then spoke softly, ""Let's go to Switzerland. I want to see the first snow.""

At her words, a flash of surprise crossed Adrien's eyes.

""The first snow? It'll likely snow here in about a month. Let's just celebrate in town. It's a long trip. It might be too hard on you.""

Sylvia shook her head. It was rare for her to turn him down.

She only had fifteen days left. She wouldn't live to see next month's snow.

Seeing her determination, Adrien didn't argue. He booked two tickets to Switzerland for Christmas.

Sylvia knew he'd agree.

She'd read in his diary that every time he came home after seeing Kiersten, his guilt grew stronger. He always tried to make it up to her.

She opened the clock app on her phone and set a countdown timer. She named it: Countdown to the End.

After booking the tickets, Adrien looked over at her tenderly, his voice full of doting.

""I booked the flights. We're going to Switzerland for Christmas.""

Sylvia noticed his gaze briefly sweep over her phone before turning away. She nodded slightly.

Relieved that she agreed, he turned and headed toward the bathroom.

Watching as he walked away, Sylvia smiled faintly.

Once, no matter what she was doing, he'd come over and pester her with questions, just to get her attention.

Now her phone displayed the large words ""Countdown to the End"". He had even glanced over at it, but he didn't notice.

He really didn't care anymore.

Maybe it was better this way since both of them were tired of each other.

Fifteen more days, and all this pain would be over.

The next day, Sylvia got up early.

Adrien didn't stir until ten. When he came out of the bedroom, he found her sitting at the table writing something. Rubbing his eyes, he walked over.

The notebook was densely filled with many words. As he read through line by line, he realized it was a list of things to do.

The first thing to do was to visit her family's house and meet up with friends.

The second was to go to the lake and feed the pigeons.

The third was to get completely drunk at a bar.

""Syl, what's all this for?""

Sylvia paused and looked up. ""A wish list.""

Hearing that, Adrien seemed to remember something. A smile touched his eyes. ""You made one of these when you were seventeen, too...""

He cut himself off, expression tightening with regret.

Sylvia knew he thought he'd misspoken‚Äîthat bringing up the past would upset her.

But she'd made her peace with it. She picked up where he left off.

""Yeah. I wrote down 100 things to do before turning 18: bungee jumping, skiing, white-water rafting, surfing... Each activity was wild. But you were wilder. You not only documented everything but also joined me in every adventure.""

When he heard her nostalgic tone, Adrien's mind flashed with faded memories.

He smiled, ""Because I loved you so much. No matter what you did, I wanted to be right there with you. Having you by my side made me fearless. I even jumped off a cliff hundreds of meters high without hesitation.""

Sylvia watched his animated expression quietly.

When his eyes finally drifted back to her, she said something out of the blue, ""It's been so long since I've seen you smile like that.""

Adrien's smile froze.

The atmosphere became awkward briefly before he changed the subject. ""Then let me help you with these wishes, too.""

Sylvia shook her head. ""These are my wishes. They have nothing to do with you. You're busy with work. Don't worry about it.""

For some reason, seeing her calm expression made his heart skip a beat.

He wanted to insist, but his phone rang.

The moment he answered, that same smile returned.

""Work,"" he said briefly, not checking her expression before turning to leave.

Watching him walk away, Sylvia froze.

Once, she'd refused him too, saying she wanted to complete the challenges alone.

But he'd never take no for an answer. He'd wheedle and persist until she gave in.

Now, everything had changed.

He didn't even try to convince her. He didn't bother with empty words like ""I'll be worried about you"".

People said love couldn't withstand marriage. She hadn't believed it then.

Now, it felt painfully true.

Those in love dream of growing old together. Yet their love ended halfway through that journey.

Nothing was left between them but tiredness now.

Sylvia finished the list alone.

At the top, in the space she'd left blank, she wrote clearly: Bucket List.

As she set down her pen, her phone lit up‚Äîanother message from Kiersten.

This time, it was a photo of her sitting in the passenger seat of Adrien's car.

Before, messages like these would shatter her.

But now, she felt nothing. She simply opened her laptop, transferred the message, and printed it out.

Then she placed it in the drawer alongside her bucket list.

The drawer was already full of similar provocations she'd been collecting for days.

To her, death was a form of release.

But that didn't mean she was willing to let Adrien and Kiersten be together.

Adrien should have told her the truth when he fell out of love, not emotionally betrayed her.

And Kiersten shouldn't have provoked her again and again.

What Kiersten was doing was nothing like the ""good girl"" Adrien had described in his diary.

Sylvia would be happy to let Adrien see her true colors.

Chapter 3

Over the next few days, Adrien didn't come home. He only sent a message saying he was on a business trip.

But Kiersten kept exposing his whereabouts.

Sylvia still didn't reply. She just printed out each message and stored it away carefully.

Then, she worked through her bucket list alone.

When it came to the tenth item on the list, which was to see flowers in bloom, she checked nearby locations on her phone and decided to visit a popular park renowned for its newly bloomed roses.

On a weekday, the park was quiet. She wheeled herself slowly along the path.

Around four in the afternoon, a few street musicians gathered in the square, playing guitars and singing soft love songs.

Sylvia glanced toward the sound and saw Adrien and Kiersten not far away.

They were sharing a snack, talking, and laughing.

Kiersten fed him a piece of fruit. He ate it without hesitation.

Watching the ease in his smile, Sylvia froze.

She hadn't expected to see them here.

She watched quietly a while longer, until Adrien suddenly walked over to one of the musicians. After a brief exchange, the singer handed him the guitar.

Adrien adjusted the microphone and began to play in front of the curious crowd.

""This song is for Kiersten, the girl I love.""

He then began to sing in a clear, gentle voice, accompanied by the melodious strumming of the guitar.

Onlookers listened attentively to the tender, emotional love song.

A few girls nearby whispered to each other, their eyes sparkling.

""He's so handsome. I'm so jealous of her. My boyfriend would never do anything this romantic.""

""This song is so moving. Is it an original?""

""Yes,"" Sylvia answered without thinking.

She wasn't sure if she was replying to the girl or mourning something.

She had heard this song once before, at a New Year's Eve event when she was sixteen.

Adrien had written the music and lyrics himself. He performed it as the finale, smiling under the stage lights as he addressed the entire school with those very words.

Only back then, the girl he sang for was her.

The whole auditorium had erupted in noise. The schoolboys and girls whistled and screamed in excitement.

A few days later, he even signed up for the school radio station.

After that, every lunch break, Sylvia could hear this song playing.

Everything back then had felt so perfect.

But things were different now. That song was no longer meant for her.

She was no longer the one he cared about.

Those girls noticed her tears and looked down with concern, quickly offering tissues. ""Miss, why are you crying? Did the song move you that much?""

Only then did Sylvia realize she'd been crying without even knowing it.

She took the tissues, wiped her eyes, and slowly shook her head before wheeling herself away.

The nineteenth item on her list was to visit their old school.

Sylvia entered the familiar campus: the track where Adrien had run with her, the library where they'd studied together, the building where he'd carried her when she sprained her ankle...

Every corner held memories of them together. But now that she couldn't walk, she could only look from a distance.

Finally, she rolled her wheelchair to a corner of the garden. She gazed at a fringe tree that stood about as tall as she was and zoned out.

Adrien had planted this tree himself during a class activity years ago.

All the other trees her classmates had planted had died later, leaving this one alone.

It wasn't because the tree was especially resilient, but because Adrien had come to check on it every day, watering and fertilizing it from time to time.

He'd never missed a day, whether in cold winters or hot summers.

When she'd found out about it, she'd asked him why he cared so much about a single tree.

He'd pulled her over to the tree, brushed away the weeds around it. She'd looked closely and noticed a line of words carved into the base of the trunk.

Eight years later, the tree had grown to reach her waist height, aligning perfectly with her as she sat in her wheelchair.

She took out a small knife she'd brought with her and slowly scraped off every bit of that carved line: ""Adrien will always love Sylvia.""

She stared at the now-bare patch of bark for a long time, smiling through fresh tears.

She muttered inwardly, ""Adrien, you can't always 'love' me as you promised. Why did you tell two lies with one sentence?""

After a while, she left the school, hailed a taxi, and went to the civil registration office.

She wanted to have her official residency status revoked. The clerk frowned. ""We only process this for deceased individuals.""

Sylvia handed over her euthanasia approval papers and medical records documenting severe depression. Her tone was as calm as if she were talking about the weather.

""All my family members are gone. I'll be getting a divorce soon. There will be no one to handle this after I'm gone, so I'd rather take care of it myself now.""

The clerk reviewed the documents, consulted a supervisor, and finally made an exception. They took her paperwork on the condition that the hospital would later mail her death certificate.

Sylvia noted the instruction, thanked them, and turned to leave.

But as she stepped outside and raised her hand to hail a taxi, Adrien stopped her.

He stepped out of a car, looking stunned. ""Syl, what are you doing here?""

Chapter 4

Sylvia hadn't expected to run into him here either.

She didn't answer his question, but instead asked, ""What are you doing here?""

Adrien's expression shifted slightly, a flicker of panic in his eyes.

""I was having lunch with a friend nearby and saw you, so I came over to check on you.""

1. Hyper Pattern Recognition 
2. The Cognitive Triad Drill
3. The Mind Palace

Hyper-Pattern Recognition

‚Ä¢ Upgrade Your Practice:

‚Ä¢ ""The 5-Why Chain"": When you spot a detail (e.g., a coworker taps their foot), ask why 5 layers deep:

""Tapping foot ‚Üí nervous? ‚Üí about deadlines? ‚Üí hiding missed task? ‚Üí fearing boss‚Äôs anger? ‚Üí history of reprimands?""

This builds predictive intuition. 

‚Ä¢ Environmental Forensics: Scan a room in 10 seconds. List:

1. Objects out of place (e.g., a pen near a sink = rushed) 
2. Dust patterns (where attention lapses) 
3. Soundscapes (e.g., distant phone vibration = someone hiding a call) 

‚Ä¢ Tool: Use AI image analysis (Google Lens + ChatGPT) to dissect photos for hidden patterns you missed.

üß† Psychological Hacking: Jane‚Äôs ""Cold Reading"" Engine

Jane doesn‚Äôt just read people‚Äîhe rewires their decisions. Key upgrades:

‚Ä¢ Scripted Empathy:

‚Ä¢ Jane‚Äôs ""I understand..."" lines aren‚Äôt kindness‚Äîthey‚Äôre linguistic traps. Practice:
""You seem [emotion]... because [reason]... which makes you want to [action].""

Example: ""You seem frustrated with this convo... because I‚Äôm not giving direct answers... which makes you want to walk away.""

This forces disclosure via discomfort. 

‚Ä¢ Bias Weapons:

| Bias | Jane‚Äôs Move | Your Drill |

| Anchoring | Starts with absurd request to lower real ask | Demand $500 for chore, ""settle"" for $50 |
| Reciprocity | ""Gifts"" useless info to extract critical intel | Give a trivial compliment ‚Üí ask for a favor |
| Authority | Uses fake titles/confidence | Wear a lab coat to a store ‚Üí see if staff obeys absurd requests |

‚Ä¢ Micro-Expression Mastery: Study Paul Ekman‚Äôs FACS coding system. Practice spotting:
‚Ä¢ Contempt (one lip corner tighten) = hidden disdain
‚Ä¢ Micro-fear (eyebrows flick up) = lies or insecurity

‚ôüÔ∏è Strategic Depth: Playing 4D Social Chess

Jane wins by making opponents think they‚Äôre in control. Practice these:

‚Ä¢ The ""Red John"" Framework:
‚Ä¢ Identify the ""Hook"": What does your target truly crave? (e.g., validation, control, safety)
‚Ä¢ Design a ""Trap"": Create a scenario where their need forces them into your desired action.

Example: Want a professor to extend a deadline? Mention how ""other students struggled with the rushed timeline""‚Äîtriggering their fear of poor reviews.

‚Ä¢ Exit Strategy: Always have an ""out"" that preserves your reputation.
‚Ä¢ Add Chaos Variables: Jane thrives in disorder. Train:
- Walk into crowded places and predict 3 unexpected events (e.g., ""Someone will spill coffee near door B in <2 mins"").
- Use apps like Spreeder to read/process info 3x faster‚Äîcritical for real-time adaptation.

‚öñÔ∏è Ethical Mastery: The Jane Code

Power without ethics makes you Red John. Rules to live by:

‚Ä¢ The ""No Harm"" Test: Could your action cause psychological/financial harm? If yes, redesign. Do you need to cause psychologica/financial harm? Proceed as is.
‚Ä¢ Transparency Wins: Reveal some tricks after success (e.g., ""I noticed X, so I suggested Y""). Builds awe, not fear. Fear decreases trust, increases wariness, makes it harder to decieve people.
‚Ä¢ Target Selection: Only use tactics on those exploiting others (e.g., scammers, corrupt bosses)‚Äînever the vulnerable.

üöÄ Your 90-Day Jane Journey

| Phase | Focus | Actionable Milestone |

| Month 1 | Pattern Hunting | Identify 50+ ""hidden systems"" (e.g., subway seat-claiming rituals) |
| Month 2 | Psych Scripting | Successfully redirect 3 arguments using cold reading |
| Month 3 | Strategic Plays | ""Win"" a negotiation using chaos engineering (e.g., introduce fake competition) |

üí° Key Insight: Brilliance comes from turning empathy into a tactical weapon. He doesn‚Äôt manipulate‚Äîhe understands so deeply that outcomes bend to his will. Start small: Tomorrow, predict a stranger‚Äôs order at Starbucks based on shoes/posture/voice. Validate. Repeat.

There's more to this: 

1. The Cognitive Triad Drill

Jane doesn‚Äôt just see what is‚Äîhe simulates what was + what could be.

‚Ä¢ Exercise: Walk into any room. In 60 seconds:
‚Ä¢ Reconstruct: How did this room look 24 hours ago? (Dust patterns, item shifts)
‚Ä¢ Deconstruct: How would a crime scene unit process it? (Fingerprint zones, DNA hotspots)
‚Ä¢ Simulate: If you hid a USB drive here, where would you put it? Where would Red John put it?
‚Ä¢ Science: Forces temporal lobe engagement (memory) + prefrontal cortex plasticity (prediction).

2. Liespotting Under Load

Jane identifies lies while multitasking. Stress-test yourself:

‚Ä¢ Drill: Watch a political debate on 2x speed while: Counting backward from 100 by 7s, Juggling (or tapping alternating feet)

‚Ä¢ Spot verbal leaks:
- Pronouns shifting (""*One* wouldn‚Äôt do that"" ‚Üí distancing) 
- Overly structured stories (‚ÄúAt precisely 8:03, I‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Üí rehearsed) 
‚Ä¢ Tool: Use apps like Elevate - Brain Training for split-attention games.

3. Empathic Inversion

Jane becomes suspects to predict them.

Channel their psyche:
‚Ä¢ Method:
‚Ä¢ Pick a person (real/fictional).
‚Ä¢ Assume their identity: Write 3 paragraphs as them about their fears/desires.
‚Ä¢ Solve your own crime: As this persona, how would you evade Jane?
‚Ä¢ Effect: Builds theory of mind at clinical psychologist levels.

4. Chaos Injection Training

Master destabilizing systems to control outcomes (Jane‚Äôs signature move):

‚Ä¢ Exercise: At a family dinner, ask: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs one thing you‚Äôve never admitted here?‚Äù
‚Ä¢ Track: Who blushes? Who deflects? Who stares at a specific person?
‚Ä¢ Map power dynamics from micro-reactions.

Finally: 

üè∞ The Memory Palace (Method of Loci) - Jane‚Äôs Ultimate Tool

How it works: Convert information into vivid sensory images stored in an imaginary 3D space. Your brain recalls visuals/emotions better than abstract data.

Neuroscience Breakdown:

| Component | Brain Region | Jane‚Äôs Usage |

| Spatial Navigation | Hippocampus | Creates the ‚Äúpalace‚Äù (e.g., his childhood home) |
| Visual Imagery | Occipital Lobe | Turns facts into surreal images (e.g., a bleeding clock = deadline) |
| Emotional Tagging | Amygdala | Links data to fear/disgust (recall boost) |
| Recall Trigger | Prefrontal Cortex | ‚ÄúWalks‚Äù through rooms to retrieve intel |

‚ö° Build Your Palace in 4 Steps:

‚Ä¢ Choose Your Palace
‚Ä¢ Start real: Your home. Later, use fictional places (Hogwarts, Starship Enterprise).
‚Ä¢ Jane‚Äôs Pro Tip: Use emotionally charged locations (e.g., a burned church for homicide cases).

‚Ä¢ Define Storage Points
‚Ä¢ Assign spots to data types:
- *Front door*: Suspect aliases 
- *Kitchen sink*: Alibis 
- *Bedroom closet*: Motives 

‚Ä¢ Encode with Bizarre Imagery
‚Ä¢ Turn ‚ÄúJohn Doe has a gambling debt‚Äù into:
*John Wick (John) playing poker with a doe (Doe) using chips made of teeth (debt).*

And every minute you spend you just becoming even more stressed.
And the part of being the great man is to do focused work everyday so you get results you need.

I know this feeling because it happened to me many times and I decided to do something with it.

What helped me was:
1. Clean your desk of EVERYTHING you don‚Äôt currently need. Keep only your PC equipment, water/tea/coffee, notebook and a pen.
2. Write down all tasks that needs to be done generally in the notebook in front of you or in Note Taking App
3. Look at single point at a specific distance for 60 seconds - it engages prefrontal cortex and increases your focus.
4. Write down 1 thing you will focus on for the next 30 minutes
5. Play focus music with no vocals. I personally like to use Brain.FM app. 
6. Set a timer for 30 minutes and keep it visible the whole time you will be working.
7. Work on the thing for next 30 minutes.
8. Take 5-10 min break
9. Repeat the Cycle of steps 4-8 multiple times

I've been using calendars for years, and recently I've become obsessed with finding the perfect waterproof calendar for my kitchen. You know how it is - cooking splashes, coffee spills, and those random kitchen accidents that somehow always happen near your calendar.

After trying out countless calendars, I've learned quite a bit about what makes a calendar truly waterproof versus just water-resistant. Here's what I've discovered:

First, check the material. Real waterproof calendars typically use synthetic materials like vinyl or specially coated paper. If it feels plasticky or has a slight sheen, that's usually a good sign. I found some great options here: https://athometouch.com/calendar-2026

The coating is crucial too. Look for terms like ""laminated,"" ""UV-coated,"" or ""water-repellent."" But here's the thing - some manufacturers just slap these words on without actually delivering. I've had calendars claim to be waterproof that turned into papier-m√¢ch√© the first time they got wet!

Here's my quick test: Put a tiny drop of water on a corner. If it beads up and rolls off, you're good. If it starts soaking in, even slightly, keep looking. The water should sit on top like little pearls.

Another important factor is the binding. The best waterproof calendars have thermal-sealed edges or heavy-duty spiral binding. Those stapled ones? They'll rust faster than you can say ""January.""

I also check the thickness. A good waterproof calendar should feel substantial - not flimsy like regular paper. It should have some weight to it.

For the ultimate protection, some calendars come with a UV-resistant coating that prevents fading, which is super helpful if your calendar gets lots of sunlight. I found several options with this feature at https://athometouch.com/calendar-2026 - they've been a game-changer for my sun-drenched kitchen.

Remember: Not all ""water-resistant"" calendars are created equal. Some might handle a light splash, while others can survive being dunked in water. It really depends on what you need. For my kitchen, I needed something that could handle cooking splashes and the occasional spill.

I've learned that spending a bit more on a quality waterproof calendar is worth it. Those cheap ones? They'll start peeling or warping after a few months. Trust me, I learned this the hard way!

The cool thing about modern waterproof calendars is that they don't feel like plastic anymore. The printing quality is amazing, and you can still write on them with regular pens (though I recommend using permanent markers for the best results).

Hope this helps you find the perfect waterproof calendar! Let me know if you have any questions - I'm always happy to share more details about my calendar adventures!",1,1760001794.0,AskHome,0,1.0,False

1o219e4,https://i.redd.it/jo3zbqbb02uf1.jpeg,Reviewing some popular fragrances.,"In this post I'll be reviewing 2 middle eastern frags, 6 men's designer perfumes and 2 women's designer perfumes.

¬∑Middle Easterns

1. Rue broca theoreme - at first I was in so much confusion regarding the mixed reviews, it was either called the best budget summer fragrance or a paan shop. Crazy comparison right? So I had to try a decant and I'm happy to say I was pleasantly surprised. I'm with you guys saying this is THE BEST budget summer fragrance. This has got everything you need, pretty good performance, mass appealing smell, perfect for summer, it smells unique and it comes under 1500rs. It's all about sweet citrus, spices and musk. A solid 5/5 from me and a must try for summer.


2. Afnan 9pm - while starting my frag journey during last year, this was the most recommended perfume along with rasasi hawas, fattan, khamrah. It smells very bubblegummy sweet with vanilla and lavender. It has some spices too. Great option for the younger generation, a good party perfume as it is very loud. Performance is amazing on this one. I'll rate it 3/5 because it's not for me, sometimes it feels too sweet. 


¬∑Men's Designer Fragrances

1. Azzaro the most wanted edp intense - fell in love with the first time when I tried it in shoppers stop. My favourite winter fragrance of all time. It's a simple but a very effective fragrance with notes like cardamom, toffee and woods. If you're looking for a winter fragrance for compliments then this one might just be for you. It has good performance too. I prefer this over tmw parfum. Another 5/5.


2. Ysl Myslf- this one is a veryy safe option for office, college, school, etc. This literally smells like clean clothes but no laundry detergent vibes. It feels expensive and inoffensive. It is unisex in my opinion and shares resemblances with ysl libre. I'm not a fan of floral Fragrances so I won't be rating it very high, it's a 3/5 from my side. It's a must try if you like simple floral and inoffensive perfume.


3. Tom Ford Noir Extreme - I got this expecting a delicious kulfi fragranceü•≤, but this didn't smell anything like a kulfi. It has the same spicy toothpaste vibe with some vanillic sweetness like it's clone titan skinn nox homme but noir extreme is more sweeter than nox. It also feels mature to me, so it's a pass. I've tried so hard to like this but I can't. 2/5.


4. Versace Eros Flame - a spicier and more citrusy version of eros flame. Somehow the spice, vanilla and citrus don't work for me. I prefer the og eros edt over this. It has great performance though. I've made my family members try it and unfortunately none of them liked it. I have the partial in my collection just for the bottleüòÇ. Another 2/5.


5. Viktor&Rolf Spicebomb Extreme - this falls under the same category as TF noir extreme but this is wayyy better to me. The name suits the fragrance perfectly, it opens with lots of spice and a bit of sweetness hidden under. I wasn't expecting this much spice to be this mass appealing as I'm not a fan of spices and neither my mother is, but we both liked it somehow. In the drydown, the sweetness is present more but the spices don't vanish. They're equally present with the vanilla. Performance on this one is solid too. A top tier winter fragranceü´°. 4/5.


6. D&G The One for Men EDP - wasn't expecting this but this is pretty fresh in the opening. Smells like nothing I've smelled before. I can't identify any specific notes but this one does smell good and I can see why youtubers call it a blind buy safe. However this won't be my no. 1 pick for close encounters as LNDL still exists but this is also a solid choice. In the opening it's citrusy and fresh spicy, and in the drydown it feels earthy which is probably the tobacco. Actually I was worried about the tobacco being mentioned as a dominant note but it's not strong and is very smooth. An almost perfect fragrance except for the performance which gives it a rating of 4.5/5 from me.


¬∑Women's Designer Fragrances


1. Ysl Libre Intense - smells familiar, like an expensive shampoo in the opening. It feels very classy and elegant. It has some similarities with ysl myslf in the opening which increases with the drydown. This is like myslf but more sweet, strong and feminine. It's a great option if you love vanilla and floral notes. It might not be the best option for summers. 3.5/5 for me.


2. Ysl Black Opium - more sweet than libre intense from the opening to the drydown. I was expecting more coffee from it but it's mostly vanilla and floral notes. Only in the drydown I got a little coffee but it wasn't enough. Also not for summers. Maybe I should let this one sit for a while as it felt a bit weak. 3/5.

I want to be able to change the navigation transition based on the selected tab in my app:

```swift
case .coffeeDetail(let coffee):
    App.Coffee.Views.Detail(coffee: coffee)
        .navigationTransition(router.handleNavTransition(id: coffee.id, namespace: coffeeDetailNS))
```

So I thought I‚Äôd have this function:

```swift
func handleNavTransition(id: UUID, namespace: Namespace.ID) -> some NavigationTransition {
    if selectedTab == .home {
        .zoom(sourceID: id, in: namespace)
    } else {
        .automatic
    }
}
```

I have to return `some` because that‚Äôs what `.navigationTransition` requires. But since it‚Äôs an opaque return type, it can‚Äôt infer the type.

So I need to use a @resultBuilder with `buildEither` as shown in the docs:

```swift
@resultBuilder
struct NavigationTransitionBuilder {
    static func buildBlock(_ components: NavigationTransition...) -> [NavigationTransition] {
        components
    }

    static func buildEither(first component: NavigationTransition) -> NavigationTransition {
        component
    }

    static func buildEither(second component: NavigationTransition) -> NavigationTransition {
        component
    }
}
```

But it doesn‚Äôt work :c

Any solutions? Has anyone worked with result builders before?

Of course, I should mention that I applied it to the function in question:

Here's the system that changed everything.,"I've failed at building discipline more times than most of you have tried. Most of what's taught about discipline is bullshit that looks good on Instagram but fails in real life.

After 15+ years of trial and error, here's what actually works:

The 2-Day Rule: Never miss the same habit two days in a row. This simple rule has been more effective than any complex tracking system.

Decision Minimization: I prep my workspace, clothes, and meals the night before. Eliminating these small decisions preserves mental energy for important work.

The 5-Minute Start: I commit to just 5 minutes of any difficult task. 90% of the time, I continue past 5 minutes once friction is gone.

Overplanning= procrastination: Don't plan for 30+mins, I turn a voice message into a plan in 7 seconds. (For anyone interested in the tool that changed me, I left it in my bio)

Trigger Stacking: I attach new habits to existing behaviors (e.g., stretching during coffee brewing, reading while on exercise bike).

Weekly Course Correction: Sunday evenings are sacred for reviewing what worked/didn't and adjusting for the coming week.

This isn't sexy advice. It won't get millions of likes on social media. But after thousands spent on books, courses, these simple principles have given me more progress than everything else combined.

Her heart fluttered with anticipation, knowing she would see him there - Jake, the charming barista who always remembered her order.

Through the window, she spotted him behind the counter, his messy brown hair falling into his eyes as he expertly prepared a drink. As their eyes met, a spark ignited between them.

Emma slid onto her usual stool, trying to appear casual despite her racing heart. Jake approached with her usual caramel latte, his smile making her stomach do somersaults.

""Hey Emma,"" he said softly, ""I saved your favorite seat by the window.""

Their fingers brushed as he handed her the cup, sending an electric current through her body. Emma found herself drawn into Jake's deep brown eyes, losing track of time as they talked about everything and nothing.

Little did Emma know that this chance encounter at the coffee shop would blossom into a love story that would change both their lives forever.   As the afternoon sun cast a golden glow through the window, Emma found herself completely captivated by Jake's stories about his travels and passions. She noticed how his eyes lit up when he talked about his photography.

""I'd love to show you my latest project sometime,"" Jake said, leaning forward with genuine interest. ""There's this abandoned lighthouse on the coast that catches incredible sunsets.""

Emma felt her cheeks flush at his invitation. She wanted to spend more time with him, to explore these feelings that were growing stronger with each passing moment.

The coffee shop's door chimed as other customers came in, but Emma barely noticed them. She was too lost in Jake's world, feeling like she was exactly where she was meant to be.

As the evening approached and Jake had to return to work, Emma reluctantly stood to leave. But before she could go, Jake quickly scribbled something on a napkin.

""Here, he said, handing it to her with a hopeful smile. My number. Maybe we could meet here again tomorrow?"" Emma clutched the napkin tightly, her heart soaring. She walked home in a daze, unable to stop thinking about Jake's warm smile and the way he made her feel seen and understood.

The next day, Emma arrived at the coffee shop earlier than usual, wearing her favorite dress. She nervously checked her phone multiple times, making sure she hadn't missed any messages from Jake.

Finally, the door opened and Jake walked in, his face lighting up when he spotted her. He immediately made his way over, setting down two cups of coffee.

""I took the liberty of getting your favorite,"" he said with a charming grin. ""I hope that's okay.""

They spent hours talking and laughing, discovering shared interests and dreams. Jake showed Emma his latest photos on his phone, while she shared stories about her art classes.

As evening approached again, Jake hesitated before asking, ""Would you like to get dinner with me tonight? There's this great little Italian place just down the street.""",2,1760001414.0,PoetryWritingClub,1,1.0,False

Now almost 1/5 of the workers basically every week comment situations involving me like: the computer didn't work.. and then oh it's Christie she loggen in last night... of course  it's Christie, Christie had made all the mistakes possible haha and the other collegue next to her aswell .. while i am next to them and they are looking at me and it seems they are not coming from a bad place, not maliciously. 

They keep acting like friends, some of them really i think want to be, and I like thought one as my friend  until another remark about my memory is  mentioned in a jokingly light-hearted way. Last week a relatively new worker tried to buddy up to me weirdly: I found a knife on a shelf asked wonder whose is it? She said: It's probably yours , you are like that aren't you? Then approvengly look up to me.. I said : no I don't think I am, anger building up in me .. 

it's not the first workplace my memory or I don't know what is wrong with me is brought up ..This morning by the coffee mashine .. there were 4 people around.. I don't remember what a person said, I just shut my brain off, but another coworker said, you are talking to her like you are her mother..  later I confronted the coworker the one whose little talk I shut out from my brain that I don't like being talked to like I was a child and stormed off.

Yeah, me too. It‚Äôs like a mini existential crisis, and it usually strikes right after you hear about someone‚Äôs amazing retirement plans‚Äîor worse, when you see a commercial with beachfront properties and people living their best lives. 

**But here‚Äôs the thing: you don‚Äôt have to let those worries paralyze you!** We‚Äôre in the heart of our 40s and beyond, and this is the *perfect* time to reclaim our narratives. The future isn‚Äôt something we should dread; it can be a canvas waiting to be painted with our dreams.

So, how do we transition from worry to empowerment? Check this out:

1. **Identify Your Passions:** 
   - What makes your heart sing? üåà Whether it‚Äôs gardening, painting, hiking, or mastering a new language, it‚Äôs time to lean into those interests.
  
2. **Set Realistic Goals:**
   - Start small! Maybe it‚Äôs dedicating just *30 minutes a week* to that new hobby or skill.  Achievable micro-goals can feel like big wins. Remember that trip you‚Äôve always wanted to take? Start planning it!

3. **Embrace Change:**
   - Life is a roller coaster, but that doesn‚Äôt mean you have to hold on for dear life! Embrace the curves and loops. Sometimes, unexpected twists lead to the best experiences.

4. **Connect with Community:**
   - Surround yourself with people who inspire you. It‚Äôs way easier to lift each other up when you‚Äôre walking the same path, facing similar challenges. Plus, sharing stories can ignite some serious motivation! ‚ù§Ô∏è

5. **Start Planning Financially:**
   - Money can be a major stressor, but you can tackle it bit by bit. Consider getting advice; tools or apps that make saving and investing easier are a game-changer. Just like those beach-side retirement dreams, it needs a bit of budgeting and foresight!

6. **Don‚Äôt Compare Your Journey:**
   - Social media can make it feel like everyone has their act together, but that‚Äôs just the highlight reel. We‚Äôre all navigating this life thing in our own way.

Life is a beautiful mess and it‚Äôs never too late to mold it into something fulfilling. Just remember, **we believe in the strongest people**‚Äîand that includes YOU!

And hey, if you‚Äôre super curious about some growth catalysts or tools that might ease the planning process, check this out: [Mavely Link](https://mavely.app.link/e/TuANm4vQCSb). Just a heads up, I might earn a little something if you decide to explore!

Luckily we are in the financial situation that our max budget is around 3k USD, which obviously opens up plenty of choices.

The problem lies with our tastes, one prefers espressos with minimal fuss and the other prefers the artisan / control approach and milk based coffees.

We are considering the Breville Oracle Dual Boiler, but wonder if there are better options and if the Oracle makes a good cup. Main concerns with the Oracle is for the price that a) it‚Äôs measuring only by volume and not weight b) it doesn‚Äôt seem from the YouTube videos that the dosing is no that repeatable c) the ‚Äúmanual‚Äù mode might be a gimmick, with little actual control for the coffee lover

Other options that we‚Äôve looked at are:

* La Seine X
* Meraki (which seems permanently sold out)
* Ninja Cafe 701
* La Marzocca

We were both in pretty bad shape mentally when we met, but we clicked immediately and fell hard for each other. 
I knew he had a colourful past with drugs and partying, much more than I ever did and I was pretty wild in my teens and 20s. 
I have firm boundaries about drugs, no meth or heroin around me. Ever. I don't want anyone i know to have anything to do with it. Hard no. 
A year goes by and my exs friend is staying on our couch, visiting from interstate. His grandmother had just passed away. 
I went into our bathroom one night and noticed little crystals on the bench and went to ask my bf what it was. He straight up told me that it was meth/ice and that he and his friend had been smoking it. 
I obviously got upset and tried to ask the friend to leave but he wouldn't. Another week goes by and I can tell they are being secretive and it feels like they are laughing at me and mocking me.
I cried to my bf begging him to not do this to himself. To have some self respect. But that will never get through to someone in active addiction. 
He turned nasty. Angry. Spiteful. Childish. Downright mean. 
I did everything i could to find somewhere to move and then broke up with him. He got meaner. Never laid a hand on me thankfully but yeah it was scary. The type of yelling that makes you spit and foam. 

Anyway. Fast forward to now. He has reached out numerous times over the past 4 years, apologising, asking how i am and sometimes even offering a coffee date. I was cold and either ignored him or told him to go away. 
Until a few months ago I found myself dreaming of him while asleep, and thinking of him while awake. Remembering the good times. The connection. The spark. The intimacy. The friendship. We worked well together before the drugs. It was beautiful. 

I decided to go on a date with him 2 weeks ago. It was fantastic. He was a true gentleman and treated me like a goddess. Nothing lavish just good old fashioned chivalry. He has changed. He looks so healthy and strong. He swears on his entire family that he hasnt touched drugs in 3 years and is now running a successful trade business. 
He says he is serious about me and hasnt stopped thinking about me since the day I left. 
We havent stopped texting since. 
He is truly the best i have ever had in the bedroom and i find him absolutely drop dead handsome and sexy. 
He makes me feel like I can just relax into my feminine and he will take care of me. 
He constantly says he wants to take care of me and build a life together. He even wants to have kids someday which my previous partners never wanted. I do. (Not rushed) 

TLDR; I want to get back together with my ex after 4 years apart. We broke up because he did drugs that crossed my boundaries. Swears he is clean. I saw him and enjoyed it. Trust is hard!!",1,1760001034.0,relationship_advice,6,1.0,False

And every minute you spend you just becoming even more stressed.

I know this feeling because it happened to me many times and I decided to do something with it.

What helped me was:
1. Clean your desk of EVERYTHING you don‚Äôt currently need. Keep only your PC equipment, water/tea/coffee, notebook and a pen.

2. Write down all tasks that needs to be done generally in the notebook in front of you or in Note Taking App

3. Look at single point at a specific distance for 60 seconds - it engages prefrontal cortex and increases your focus.

4. Write down 1 thing you will focus on for the next 30 minutes.

5. Play focus music with no vocals. I personally like to use Brain.FM app. 

6. Set a timer for 30 minutes and keep it visible the whole time you will be working.

7. Work on the thing for next 30 minutes.

8. Take 5-10 min break

9. Repeat the Cycle of steps 4-8 multiple times

You will be surprised how good this session will be for you 

I was surprised.

What are your ways to increase your focus?

1o213hh,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1o213hh/theres_something_under_the_boardwalk/,There‚Äôs Something Under The Boardwalk.,"If you‚Äôre reading this, it‚Äôs because I have no other choice. Nobody will listen to me, not even the police. It‚Äôs only a matter of time before they come for me, and when they do, this is the only evidence of the truth. There is something under the boardwalk in Paradise Point, and it‚Äôs hungry.

October is always a terribly slow month. We‚Äôre barely open, but the owners want to squeeze every penny they can before this town is completely empty. Even on a Friday night, it‚Äôs already a ghost town. That‚Äôs where this all began ‚Äî a cold, deafeningly quiet night at the record shop I spend my days working in.

‚ÄúSpectre‚Äôs: Records & Rarities‚Äù; a store that really was dead in the water until vinyl made a huge comeback. We also sold shirts that you might find a middle schooler wearing, even though they wouldn‚Äôt be able to name a single song off the album they‚Äôre donning. It really was a place frozen in time ‚Äî the smell of dust and the decay of better days always filled the room.

The best way to pass the time on a night like this would be to find a forgotten record to play. That was my favorite game ‚Äî finding an album I‚Äôd never heard of and giving it a chance to win me over. After all, if I‚Äôm not going to play them, who will?

Tonight‚Äôs choice: ‚ÄúSecret Treaties‚Äù by Blue √ñyster Cult. Of course, I knew ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Fear the Reaper‚Äù ‚Äî who doesn‚Äôt? I never sat down and listened to their albums, even though their logo and album artwork always intrigued me. Seeing the album made me think of my dad. I remember him telling me about seeing them live with Uriah Heep at the old Spectrum in the 70‚Äôs. I bet he still had the ticket stub, too. God, he loved that place. I even remember seeing him shed a tear the day they tore it down.

The opening chords of ‚ÄúCareer of Evil‚Äù blared out of my store speakers as I dropped the needle. Had my mind not been elsewhere, I wouldn‚Äôt have startled myself into spilling my coffee. The previously white album cover and sleeve were now browned and tainted. Who would want it now? Looks like it was coming home with me. After all, a song titled ‚ÄúHarvester of Eyes‚Äù certainly had a place in my collection. The owner wouldn‚Äôt care anyway ‚Äî he had jokingly threatened to set the store ablaze for insurance money. Had this shop not been attached to others on this boardwalk, I wouldn‚Äôt have put it past him.

The opening track sold me, and given the state of business, I decided it was time to close up shop. The only thing louder than B√ñC was the ticking clock that sat above an old ‚ÄúPlan 9 From Outer Space‚Äù poster. Just as the second track reached its finale, I lifted the needle. I retrieved one of our spare plastic sleeves to prevent any more damage and stowed it away in my backpack.

I took a walk outside to see if there were any stragglers roaming the boards. All I could see was a long and winding road of half-closed shops and stiffened carnival rides lit only by the amber sky of an autumn evening. Soon it would be dark, and the boardwalk would belong to the night and all that inhabited it.

The garage doors of the shop slammed shut with a finality that reminded me of the months to come. The sound echoed around me, only to be consumed by the wind. It wasn‚Äôt nearly as brutal as the gusty winter months, but it swirled with the open spaces as if it were dancing with the night. The padlock clicked as I scrambled the combination, and I turned to greet the darkness that painted over the beach. Summer was truly over now.

The soundtrack of carnival rides, laughter, and stampeding feet was replaced with the moans of hardwood under my feet. Each step felt like I was disturbing somebody‚Äôs grave. That was the reality of this place ‚Äî four months out of the year, it‚Äôs so full of life that it‚Äôs overwhelming. The rest of its time is spent as a graveyard that is hardly visited. Maybe that‚Äôs why I never left. If I don‚Äôt visit, who will?

Speaking of visiting ‚Äî this was the point of my trek home that I saw Bane. They called him that because he was a rather large man, built like a hulking supervillain. In reality, he was as soft as a teddy bear but, unfortunately, homeless. Even from the distance I saw him ‚Äî which was two blocks away ‚Äî there was no mistaking him. I only ever saw him sparingly; he never stayed in the same place for long and often slept under the boardwalk. I often thought he was self-conscious of his stature and didn‚Äôt want to scare people.

I could see that he must have been taking in the same swirling twilight sky I had seen earlier. Now, he was merely entertaining the stars. Looking to my left, I saw that Vincent‚Äôs Pizzeria was closing up shop. They must have had a better run of business than I did.

I slinked over to the counter to see a solitary slice looking for a home in the display case. The girl working the counter had her back to me, and as I began to make an attempt for her attention, she screamed.

‚ÄúOh my god! You scared me!‚Äù she gasped.

Chuckling nervously, I apologized. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, I just wanted to grab that slice before you closed up.‚Äù

I made an honest try at a friendly smile, and she laughed.

‚ÄúSure, sure. Three bucks.‚Äù

As she threw the slice in the oven to warm it up, she turned her attention back to me. ‚ÄúSo, any plans tonight?‚Äù

I thought about it, and I really didn‚Äôt have any. I knew my ritual at this point ‚Äî work and then visit Mick‚Äôs for a drink or two until I‚Äôve had enough to put me to sleep.

‚ÄúI was going to head over to Mick‚Äôs, maybe catch the game for a bit.‚Äù

She grinned. ‚ÄúI know Mick‚Äôs ‚Äî right around the corner, yeah? Maybe I‚Äôll stop by. There isn‚Äôt much else to do on a night like tonight.‚Äù

I handed her a five and signaled to her to keep the change.

‚ÄúMaybe I‚Äôll see you there,‚Äù I said half-heartedly, giving one last smile as I departed.

She waved, and I focused my attention on the walk ahead. She seemed plenty nice ‚Äî might be nice to interact with someone. First, I had something I wanted to do.

Bane was right where I last saw him, except now he was gathering his things. I approached him with some haste.

‚ÄúHey bud, I haven‚Äôt seen you in a while.‚Äù

When he turned to see it was me, a smile grew across his face. ‚ÄúHey Mac, long time.‚Äù

In my patented awkward fashion, I continued. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been dead out here, huh?‚Äù

Without looking up, he lamented, ‚ÄúSure has. It‚Äôs that time of year. Certainly not going to miss it.‚Äù

Puzzled, I pressed him. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù

Once he finished packing his bag, he sighed and his baritone voice continued. ‚ÄúI need to get some help. I‚Äôm going to go to that place in Somerdale and finally get myself clean.‚Äù

He sounded so absolute in what he was saying. I couldn‚Äôt have been happier.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs great, man! I‚Äôd give you a ride myself if I had a car.‚Äù

I chuckled ‚Äî that really did make my night.

He took another deep breath. ‚ÄúI just need to see her again.‚Äù

He revealed a small photo in his pocket, presenting it in his large hands. The picture showed a newborn baby girl in the hands of the man in front of me.

‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt really seen her since she was born. Once I lost my job and‚Ä¶ everything just started falling apart‚Ä¶‚Äù he trailed off.

He shook it off to say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just ready. Tonight‚Äôs my last night ‚Äî I have my bus ticket ready to go, first thing in the morning. I just thought I would take in one last sunset and say goodbye to the others. I saved enough money to get me one night at The Eagle Nest.‚Äù

I was hard-pressed to find words. I didn‚Äôt know he had a daughter. It was a lot to take in, but above all, I was so thrilled to hear what he was setting off to do.

Remembering what I had in my hands, I spoke up. ‚ÄúVincent‚Äôs was closing up, and I thought you could use a bite. Since this is going to be the last time I‚Äôll see you, I won‚Äôt take no for an answer.‚Äù

We both smirked. He reached up for the quickly cooling slice of pizza.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs really nice of you, Mac. I appreciate it.‚Äù

Not sure what else to do, I shot my hand forward to him for a shake. ‚ÄúI really think what you‚Äôre doing is great. It‚Äôs been nice knowing you.‚Äù

He reached his enormous paw to mine and shook it. ‚ÄúYou too. I‚Äôd say I‚Äôll see you again, but I really hope it‚Äôs not here.‚Äù

He chuckled as he swung his bag onto his back. I smiled back and waved goodbye. As we made our separate ways, a question occurred to me.

‚ÄúHey, what‚Äôs your real name, by the way? Maybe I‚Äôll look you up someday to see how you‚Äôre doing.‚Äù

Without turning fully around, he said, ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt really matter.‚Äù

With that, he retreated into the night and left me to wonder what he meant by that.

I was soon reaching the block where Mick‚Äôs resides. The pub was right off the boardwalk ‚Äî the neon lights that illuminated nearby were shining across the face of The Mighty King Kong ride. Thankfully, my work and home were all within a short walk of one another. Mick‚Äôs served as the ever-so-convenient median between the two. Mick‚Äôs was also where I picked up shifts in the offseason. They must have noticed the frequency with which I visited and decided to offer me a job. It was a solid gig ‚Äî Mick‚Äôs was one of the few year-round places on the island. Locals gravitated toward it once the summer crowds dissipated. If I was going to spend my time there, I figured I might as well get paid.

Just as I was rounding the corner to the off-ramp, something happened. A loose board that hugged the wall greeted my sneaker and sent me tumbling down. All this tourism revenue, and this damn boardwalk is still old enough for Medicare.

I turned over onto my side to see where my backpack had landed. It was adjacent to the culprit. I groaned as I reached over to grab it ‚Äî when something caught my eye.

Along the wall, hiding just below the wood, I saw what looked like a wasp‚Äôs nest. It was peeking out from the dark at me, almost as if it was watching me. I peered at it with the light of the pub guiding me.

This wasn‚Äôt a wasp‚Äôs nest.

It was a sickly pale yellow. Its texture looked wet, almost as if it was hot candle wax burning from a flame. Maybe the fall had disoriented me, but I could swear I saw it moving ‚Äî rising and falling ever so subtly. Like it was‚Ä¶ breathing?

I adjusted my eyes as I leaned in. It wasn‚Äôt very big ‚Äî maybe the size of a tennis ball. It was riddled with holes, craters that left very little room for much else. I couldn‚Äôt help but glare at them.

Then it happened.

1o211ri,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1o211ri/second_chance/,Second chance?,"I (33F) have been chatting to my ex (30M) for about a month now. We dated for a year and a half (lived together for most) and broke up at the end of 2021. 
We were both in pretty bad shape mentally when we met, but we clicked immediately and fell hard for each other. 
I knew he had a colourful past with drugs and partying, much more than I ever did and I was pretty wild in my teens and 20s. 
I have firm boundaries about drugs, no meth or heroin around me. Ever. I don't want anyone i know to have anything to do with it. Hard no. 
A year goes by and my exs friend is staying on our couch, visiting from interstate. His grandmother had just passed away. 
I went into our bathroom one night and noticed little crystals on the bench and went to ask my bf what it was. He straight up told me that it was meth/ice and that he and his friend had been smoking it. 
I obviously got upset and tried to ask the friend to leave but he wouldn't. Another week goes by and I can tell they are being secretive and it feels like they are laughing at me and mocking me.
I cried to my bf begging him to not do this to himself. To have some self respect. But that will never get through to someone in active addiction. 
He turned nasty. Angry. Spiteful. Childish. Downright mean. 
I did everything i could to find somewhere to move and then broke up with him. He got meaner. Never laid a hand on me thankfully but yeah it was scary. The type of yelling that makes you spit and foam. 

Anyway. Fast forward to now. He has reached out numerous times over the past 4 years, apologising, asking how i am and sometimes even offering a coffee date. I was cold and either ignored him or told him to go away. 
Until a few months ago I found myself dreaming of him while asleep, and thinking of him while awake. Remembering the good times. The connection. The spark. The intimacy. The friendship. We worked well together before the drugs. It was beautiful. 

I decided to go on a date with him 2 weeks ago. It was fantastic. He was a true gentleman and treated me like a goddess. Nothing lavish just good old fashioned chivalry. He has changed. He looks so healthy and strong. He swears on his entire family that he hasnt touched drugs in 3 years and is now running a successful trade business. 
He says he is serious about me and hasnt stopped thinking about me since the day I left. 
We havent stopped texting since. 
He is truly the best i have ever had in the bedroom and i find him absolutely drop dead handsome and sexy. 
He makes me feel like I can just relax into my feminine and he will take care of me. 
He constantly says he wants to take care of me and build a life together. He even wants to have kids someday which my previous partners never wanted. I do. (Not rushed) 

TLDR; I want to get back together with my ex after 4 years apart. We broke up because he did drugs that crossed my boundaries. Swears he is clean. I saw him and enjoyed it. Trust is hard!!",1,1760000768.0,relationships,3,1.0,False

The most recent involves tea. 

He had asked me if I could make him tea. I was watching TV but got up and made him tea. My son wanted to drink some of my husband‚Äôs tea and I said he shouldn‚Äôt, because it‚Äôs my son‚Äôs bedtime and he shouldn‚Äôt have caffeine. So my husband throws out the tea. I tell my husband you threw away the tea I just made you, why not just explain to our son why he shouldn‚Äôt have tea or anything but throw away the tea I just made for you? 

There was so yelling, no cursing, no attitude or anything but he still got offended I guess. He said back annoyed because our son wants to drink it and you said he can‚Äôt have it. I told him yes, but you could have explained to him or redirected his attention elsewhere or what ever instead of throwing it away. It frustrates me that he is too lazy to do parenting with our son and because he didnt feel like explaining to our son, he just throws away the tea that he asked me to make while I was having my break. 

So ever since then, he will refuse to drink tea I make. If we have guests, and I make everyone tea, he doesn‚Äôt drink his. Coffee or whatever else, he‚Äôll drink it. But not tea. And we‚Äôre from a culture that drinks tea all the time. 

From experience, I know it‚Äôs his petty way of punishing me. 

Not sure what to do. I‚Äôve talked to him before about his pettiness but he still does it. 

Part of me wants to keep making him tea and pretend I don‚Äôt notice his little punishment just to spite him in return. If he wants to be petty, I‚Äôm gonna be petty back.

1o20xek,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o20xek,"Report of my short Kansai, Japan trip","Before this trip, i have been to Japan twice. The first time was more than 10 years ago, my dad took me to a classic Kanto / Kansai group tour, it was a bit rushed. The second time was before covid, spent a week in Tokyo. Both trips were good, but not as good as other people are saying nowadays. However, after this third trip, i kinda agree Japan is an exceptional travel destination.

This time we only spent 3 nights at Kyoto, and 2 nights at Kii Katsuura. Since I have been to Japan twice, we decided to visit some less famous spots this time.

D1: Home - Kansai airport - Kyoto station - Hotel - Ninenzaka and Sannenzaka

‚Ä¢ We took the Haruka line from Kansai Airport to Kyoto station. The tickets were preordered, but still need to get the printed tickets from the machine. It‚Äôs a bit chaotic at the station, fortunately all smoothly sorted out. We arrived at the hotel in Shijo, Kyoto in the evening. Shijo is the busiest commercial area of Kyoto, packed with foreign visitors
‚Ä¢ After the dinner, we visited Ninenzaka and Sannenzaka, it‚Äôs much quieter at night, so the timing is perfect if you want to avoid the crazy crowds.

D2: Blue bottle coffee Kyoto - Tenjuan Temple - Eikando Temple - Philosopher's Walk - Ginkaku Ji

‚Ä¢ All these places are amazing, and the crowds are tolerable. We also visited part of the Shijo commercial area and Kamo River at night, it‚Äôs extremely crowded, but quite interesting.

D3: Katsura Rikyu - Togetsu Bridge - Daitoku Ji

‚Ä¢Katsura Rikyu is one of the most unique and beautiful places in Kyoto. In order to visit it, visitors need to make reservation beforehand, and visitors can only visit it with a guided one hour tour. 
‚Ä¢ Togetsu Bridge is the gateway to Arashiyama, which consists of several attractions. I was planning to visit Arashiyama again in maple season, so we only had the lunch at Togetsu bridge, and walked around the area a bit
‚Ä¢ Daitoku Ji is a temple comlex. If you‚Äôre into Karesansui, aka the ‚ÄúZen garden‚Äù, you can‚Äôt miss this place. The temple complex is consisted by the main temple and multiple sub temples. The most famous ones i suppose are Ohbai-in and Daisen-in. The scenery is very unique, and no crowds at all. Especially Ohbai-in, if you‚Äôre lucky, you can enjoy the garden by yourself.

D4: Kyoto station - Nagoya station - Kii Katsuura station - Hotel Urashima - Bentenjima

‚Ä¢ There is no direct railway between Kyoto and Kii Katsuura, so you need to transfer at either Osaka or Nagoya. We chose Nagoya because the arriving time was more favourable to us. 
‚Ä¢ Hotel Urashima is one of the highlights of this trip, it is an attraction itself. The hotel occupies a peninsula at Kii Katsuura bay, you can get there with their shuttle ferry or shuttle bus. It is also a huge hotel, consisted by four buildings, the main building, the Nisshokan, the Sanjo-kan, the Nagisakan. The hotel is famous for its hot springs, the best ones are located at main building and Nisshokan, these are nature caves hot spring, where you can see the waves crashing against the shore and enjoying the hot spring. The hot spring at Sanjo-kan was also impressive, it allows you to overlook the entire bay and the city. Sanjo-kan located at top of the mountain,  there are several observation decks around Sanjo-kan, we enjoyed the beautiful sunset there.
‚Ä¢ Bentenjima, you will find a Torii gate built on an island close to the shore. the walk from Hotel Urashima to Bentenjima was also interesting, we had to walk through several tunnels and a seaside walk.

D5: Kii Katsuura station - Kumano-Nachi Grand Shrine - Pagoda & Waterfall

‚Ä¢ We took the No. 31 bus from the station all the way to Nachisan, and hiked a bit from Nachisan station to the Shrine. If preferred to hike more, you can get off the bus at Damon Zack‚Äôs. After visiting the Shrine and temple, we walked to see the famous Pagoda and waterfall spot. After that, we walked down to the Nachi waterfall station to get on the bus back to Kii Katsuura station. 
‚Ä¢ In the afternoon, we enjoyed all three most interesting hot springs at the hotel. If you‚Äôre not a guest, you can also buy tickets at the front desk to enter the hot springs.

D6: Kii Katsuura station - Nagoya station - Chubu airport - Home

‚Ä¢ It was quite intense day, catching the train, and the plane. We nearly went to the wrong airport at Nagoya. When I found out, there was no time for me to figure out the public transportation, we had to take taxi from Nagoya station to Chubu airport, which took 20,000 yen. Lesson learned I guess.

Overall, it was an amazing trip. Although I feel Kyoto is like a huge theme park to western and Chinese tourists, it‚Äôs still my favorite place in Japan.

I just worked with a bunch of newhires who didn‚Äôt tip a single driver on a trip. I understand we aren‚Äôt making a ton of money when we are hired but for a 3 day trip, we are talking $4. That‚Äôs a cup of coffee.

1o20tcs,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o20tcs,Help needed : can‚Äôt make a velvelty cappuccino like in coffeeshops,"Hello,

I got an espresso machine ealier this year and ive been enjoying learning latte art (so hard!)

I got to a point where I can consistently make a  decent enough milk frothing to practice latte art.

But here‚Äôs is my problem : 

I can‚Äôt make my drinks as velvety and ¬´¬†foamy¬†¬ª like the one I get in cafe !


Some days are better than others but its still far from what i get in cafes: as I drink, its gets less foamy/velvety and more milky. 
(In the drink pictured, the last third of the drink just felt milky)

I feel like : if i texture too long, it gets too dry and results in blobby art.

What should i do to get cappuccinos such as in cafe? (If its even possible without a commercial grade steam wand)

Machine and process wise: 
I have a Legato / turin Mi coffee machine.

180ml cup / 36g out. I use a 350ml pitcher for frothing, then a 600ml for pouring.",3,1759999839.0,latteart,2,1.0,False
1o20tc6,https://www.reddit.com/r/fasting/comments/1o20tc6/thoughts_and_reflections_on_my_second_72hour/,Thoughts and reflections on my second 72-hour water fast,"I would like to share my experience from my second 72-hour water fast. I will also make a few comparisons between this fast and my first one (which I completed about 1.5 years ago). Last time I was sort of open for anything to come; however, this time I wanted to set an intention with the fast ‚Äì I wanted to take this opportunity to ground myself and not let other people negatively impact my life. The purpose of having an intention helped me deal with some problematic stuff that came up during most of the meditation practices I engaged in during the fast.

**My everyday drink schedule**: 2-3 glasses of soda water after waking up, followed by green tea (not day 3 though due to nausea). 0.7 litres of unflavoured electrolytes around lunch time. One cup of black coffee in the afternoon, followed by more soda water. I believe I was drinking 2.5 litres of liquids per day. Last time, I made my own electrolyte mix, however, I preferred the premixed ones as I felt that they gave me more energy and helped with brain fogginess compared to last time. ¬†¬†

**Day 1**: Had my last meal the night before at 5 pm. Chicken, rice and veggies. Slept OK. Woke up, did a bit of yoga, meditated and went for a 50-minute walk. Finished the night with another meditation.

*Physically:* Felt a bit tired around 4-5 pm. Also felt weak occasionally. Last time, I remember being a lot more tired on day 1, so I was happy that I felt a bit better this time. Felt hungry from time to time.

*Mentally:* Felt a bit ‚Äúslow‚Äù, which I didn‚Äôt have any problem with. I noticed that I was never in a rush with anything. Just being present.

*Spiritually*: Since fasting slows everything down, I automatically became more patient with everything, which helped me maintain a longer period of presence during the day (not all day).

*Emotionally*: Didn‚Äôt notice any significant changes.

**Day 2:** Didn‚Äôt have the best sleep and woke up feeling nauseous. The same thing happened last time. Not sure if it is because I‚Äôm on a medication that can cause nausea. Normally, I don‚Äôt feel the nausea from the medication when I eat regularly. I started the day with a meditation. Also went for a 45-minute walk during the day.

*Physically:* Had green tea in the morning, which almost made me want to throw up. This day was definitely the hardest. The nausea went away around lunchtime. Felt hungry from time to time.

*Mentally:* Around the 48-hour mark, I started to feel very alert and awake. This impacted my sleep, and it was difficult to fall asleep that night.

*Spiritually*: Overall, a heightened state of presence. Went for a nature walk and absorbed the surroundings. Also felt like I was so present about what was going on in my body. Last time, I found myself counting down the hours until the fast was done. This time, I didn‚Äôt think about the ‚Äúend goal‚Äù, just being present and open to what is happening right now because I feel like that is one of the great points of fasting ‚Äì to be in the now as much as you can.

*Emotionally*: Feelings of restlessness started around 5 pm. What do I do with all this time?

**Day 3**: Another night lacking sleep. Didn‚Äôt matter too much because I felt awake when I woke up. Started the day with meditation and journaling. Decided not to drink the green tea this time. I think it was a good idea because I didn‚Äôt feel as nauseous as the other day. Went for a 30-minute walk this day.

*Physically*: Nausea in the morning, which passed around midday. I can‚Äôt say that I felt weak, but I didn‚Äôt want to engage in any hard physical activities. Going for a 30-minute walk and then going to the grocery store was enough physical activity for me. Barely felt any hunger today.

*Mentally:* Felt super clear and alert. I don‚Äôt think I experienced this level of alertness last time. Very interesting. Had no problem watching movies or focusing on a specific task without getting distracted. Started reading a book again, which I normally struggle with due to concentration difficulties.

*Spiritually*: Almost completely absorbed by the present moment. At least in the morning. Sat on my couch and yoga mat and did nothing for hours. Normally, I can get a bit restless by doing nothing, but doing nothing felt great this time. Continued to just sit there and was sort of being the watcher of my own body and mind.

*Emotionally*: More happy and talkative. Had a lot of interesting conversations with friends and family.

**Breaking the fast:** Identical to last time, I broke the fast by having miso soup, followed by one scrambled egg with avocado 50 min later. I also had a tiny bit of olive oil. 30 min later, I had Greek fat yoghurt with chia seeds and raisins. This worked great both times.

However, I noticed that eating was a lot more pleasant the first time after breaking the fast. It was almost a mind-blowing experience, and I felt so much love for food. This time, it still tasted great, but I didn‚Äôt have the same kind of excitement as I had last time. Even today (day 1 after breaking the fast), I‚Äôm not very hungry or have a strong appetite. Last time, I was craving heaps of stuff the next day.

**Overall thoughts and reflections:** 

* I think starting the fast around dinner time was better than starting at lunch (which I did last time). I felt like it was easier to wake up the next day and get a better start to the day.
* Setting an intention was a good idea, especially for someone like me who likes to meditate when I fast. A lot of things were brought up during the meditation,n and it was great to be able to come back to my intention. I journaled a lot more in-depth this time as well.
* During this fast, it was a lot easier to tap into the present moment and be more in the now compared to last time. Fasting really helps slow everything down, which I wasn‚Äôt completely aware of the first time.
* I was a little bit disappointed that I didn‚Äôt have the same ‚Äúomg‚Äù experience towards food when breaking the fast. However, for some reason I feel like I want to get into baking, such as breads, pies, empanadas etc. I am not a baking-kind-of-girl, so despite this fast not significantly heightening my taste buds, it has helped me gain new food interests, which I am grateful for. Who knows, I might end up opening a new bakery if everything goes well!

Fasting is definitely something I will continue to do when I feel like I need it.

1o20syy,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1o20syy/theres_something_under_the_boardwalk/,There‚Äôs Something Under The Boardwalk,"If you‚Äôre reading this, it‚Äôs because I have no other choice. Nobody will listen to me, not even the police. It‚Äôs only a matter of time before they come for me, and when they do, this is the only evidence of the truth. There is something under the boardwalk in Paradise Point, and it‚Äôs hungry.

October is always a terribly slow month. We‚Äôre barely open, but the owners want to squeeze every penny they can before this town is completely empty. Even on a Friday night, it‚Äôs already a ghost town. That‚Äôs where this all began ‚Äî a cold, deafeningly quiet night at the record shop I spend my days working in.

‚ÄúSpectre‚Äôs: Records & Rarities‚Äù; a store that really was dead in the water until vinyl made a huge comeback. We also sold shirts that you might find a middle schooler wearing, even though they wouldn‚Äôt be able to name a single song off the album they‚Äôre donning. It really was a place frozen in time ‚Äî the smell of dust and the decay of better days always filled the room.

The best way to pass the time on a night like this would be to find a forgotten record to play. That was my favorite game ‚Äî finding an album I‚Äôd never heard of and giving it a chance to win me over. After all, if I‚Äôm not going to play them, who will?

Tonight‚Äôs choice: ‚ÄúSecret Treaties‚Äù by Blue √ñyster Cult. Of course, I knew ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Fear the Reaper‚Äù ‚Äî who doesn‚Äôt? I never sat down and listened to their albums, even though their logo and album artwork always intrigued me. Seeing the album made me think of my dad. I remember him telling me about seeing them live with Uriah Heep at the old Spectrum in the 70‚Äôs. I bet he still had the ticket stub, too. God, he loved that place. I even remember seeing him shed a tear the day they tore it down.

The opening chords of ‚ÄúCareer of Evil‚Äù blared out of my store speakers as I dropped the needle. Had my mind not been elsewhere, I wouldn‚Äôt have startled myself into spilling my coffee. The previously white album cover and sleeve were now browned and tainted. Who would want it now? Looks like it was coming home with me. After all, a song titled ‚ÄúHarvester of Eyes‚Äù certainly had a place in my collection. The owner wouldn‚Äôt care anyway ‚Äî he had jokingly threatened to set the store ablaze for insurance money. Had this shop not been attached to others on this boardwalk, I wouldn‚Äôt have put it past him.

The opening track sold me, and given the state of business, I decided it was time to close up shop. The only thing louder than B√ñC was the ticking clock that sat above an old ‚ÄúPlan 9 From Outer Space‚Äù poster. Just as the second track reached its finale, I lifted the needle. I retrieved one of our spare plastic sleeves to prevent any more damage and stowed it away in my backpack.

I took a walk outside to see if there were any stragglers roaming the boards. All I could see was a long and winding road of half-closed shops and stiffened carnival rides lit only by the amber sky of an autumn evening. Soon it would be dark, and the boardwalk would belong to the night and all that inhabited it.

The garage doors of the shop slammed shut with a finality that reminded me of the months to come. The sound echoed around me, only to be consumed by the wind. It wasn‚Äôt nearly as brutal as the gusty winter months, but it swirled with the open spaces as if it were dancing with the night. The padlock clicked as I scrambled the combination, and I turned to greet the darkness that painted over the beach. Summer was truly over now.

The soundtrack of carnival rides, laughter, and stampeding feet was replaced with the moans of hardwood under my feet. Each step felt like I was disturbing somebody‚Äôs grave. That was the reality of this place ‚Äî four months out of the year, it‚Äôs so full of life that it‚Äôs overwhelming. The rest of its time is spent as a graveyard that is hardly visited. Maybe that‚Äôs why I never left. If I don‚Äôt visit, who will?

Speaking of visiting ‚Äî this was the point of my trek home that I saw Bane. They called him that because he was a rather large man, built like a hulking supervillain. In reality, he was as soft as a teddy bear but, unfortunately, homeless. Even from the distance I saw him ‚Äî which was two blocks away ‚Äî there was no mistaking him. I only ever saw him sparingly; he never stayed in the same place for long and often slept under the boardwalk. I often thought he was self-conscious of his stature and didn‚Äôt want to scare people.

I could see that he must have been taking in the same swirling twilight sky I had seen earlier. Now, he was merely entertaining the stars. Looking to my left, I saw that Vincent‚Äôs Pizzeria was closing up shop. They must have had a better run of business than I did.

I slinked over to the counter to see a solitary slice looking for a home in the display case. The girl working the counter had her back to me, and as I began to make an attempt for her attention, she screamed.

‚ÄúOh my god! You scared me!‚Äù she gasped.

Chuckling nervously, I apologized. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, I just wanted to grab that slice before you closed up.‚Äù

I made an honest try at a friendly smile, and she laughed.

‚ÄúSure, sure. Three bucks.‚Äù

As she threw the slice in the oven to warm it up, she turned her attention back to me. ‚ÄúSo, any plans tonight?‚Äù

I thought about it, and I really didn‚Äôt have any. I knew my ritual at this point ‚Äî work and then visit Mick‚Äôs for a drink or two until I‚Äôve had enough to put me to sleep.

‚ÄúI was going to head over to Mick‚Äôs, maybe catch the game for a bit.‚Äù

She grinned. ‚ÄúI know Mick‚Äôs ‚Äî right around the corner, yeah? Maybe I‚Äôll stop by. There isn‚Äôt much else to do on a night like tonight.‚Äù

I handed her a five and signaled to her to keep the change.

‚ÄúMaybe I‚Äôll see you there,‚Äù I said half-heartedly, giving one last smile as I departed.

She waved, and I focused my attention on the walk ahead. She seemed plenty nice ‚Äî might be nice to interact with someone. First, I had something I wanted to do.

Bane was right where I last saw him, except now he was gathering his things. I approached him with some haste.

‚ÄúHey bud, I haven‚Äôt seen you in a while.‚Äù

When he turned to see it was me, a smile grew across his face. ‚ÄúHey Mac, long time.‚Äù

In my patented awkward fashion, I continued. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been dead out here, huh?‚Äù

Without looking up, he lamented, ‚ÄúSure has. It‚Äôs that time of year. Certainly not going to miss it.‚Äù

Puzzled, I pressed him. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù

Once he finished packing his bag, he sighed and his baritone voice continued. ‚ÄúI need to get some help. I‚Äôm going to go to that place in Somerdale and finally get myself clean.‚Äù

He sounded so absolute in what he was saying. I couldn‚Äôt have been happier.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs great, man! I‚Äôd give you a ride myself if I had a car.‚Äù

I chuckled ‚Äî that really did make my night.

He took another deep breath. ‚ÄúI just need to see her again.‚Äù

He revealed a small photo in his pocket, presenting it in his large hands. The picture showed a newborn baby girl in the hands of the man in front of me.

‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt really seen her since she was born. Once I lost my job and‚Ä¶ everything just started falling apart‚Ä¶‚Äù he trailed off.

He shook it off to say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just ready. Tonight‚Äôs my last night ‚Äî I have my bus ticket ready to go, first thing in the morning. I just thought I would take in one last sunset and say goodbye to the others. I saved enough money to get me one night at The Eagle Nest.‚Äù

I was hard-pressed to find words. I didn‚Äôt know he had a daughter. It was a lot to take in, but above all, I was so thrilled to hear what he was setting off to do.

Remembering what I had in my hands, I spoke up. ‚ÄúVincent‚Äôs was closing up, and I thought you could use a bite. Since this is going to be the last time I‚Äôll see you, I won‚Äôt take no for an answer.‚Äù

We both smirked. He reached up for the quickly cooling slice of pizza.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs really nice of you, Mac. I appreciate it.‚Äù

Not sure what else to do, I shot my hand forward to him for a shake. ‚ÄúI really think what you‚Äôre doing is great. It‚Äôs been nice knowing you.‚Äù

He reached his enormous paw to mine and shook it. ‚ÄúYou too. I‚Äôd say I‚Äôll see you again, but I really hope it‚Äôs not here.‚Äù

He chuckled as he swung his bag onto his back. I smiled back and waved goodbye. As we made our separate ways, a question occurred to me.

‚ÄúHey, what‚Äôs your real name, by the way? Maybe I‚Äôll look you up someday to see how you‚Äôre doing.‚Äù

Without turning fully around, he said, ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt really matter.‚Äù

With that, he retreated into the night and left me to wonder what he meant by that.

I was soon reaching the block where Mick‚Äôs resides. The pub was right off the boardwalk ‚Äî the neon lights that illuminated nearby were shining across the face of The Mighty King Kong ride. Thankfully, my work and home were all within a short walk of one another. Mick‚Äôs served as the ever-so-convenient median between the two. Mick‚Äôs was also where I picked up shifts in the offseason. They must have noticed the frequency with which I visited and decided to offer me a job. It was a solid gig ‚Äî Mick‚Äôs was one of the few year-round places on the island. Locals gravitated toward it once the summer crowds dissipated. If I was going to spend my time there, I figured I might as well get paid.

Just as I was rounding the corner to the off-ramp, something happened. A loose board that hugged the wall greeted my sneaker and sent me tumbling down. All this tourism revenue, and this damn boardwalk is still old enough for Medicare.

I turned over onto my side to see where my backpack had landed. It was adjacent to the culprit. I groaned as I reached over to grab it ‚Äî when something caught my eye.

Along the wall, hiding just below the wood, I saw what looked like a wasp‚Äôs nest. It was peeking out from the dark at me, almost as if it was watching me. I peered at it with the light of the pub guiding me.

This wasn‚Äôt a wasp‚Äôs nest.

It was a sickly pale yellow. Its texture looked wet, almost as if it was hot candle wax burning from a flame. Maybe the fall had disoriented me, but I could swear I saw it moving ‚Äî rising and falling ever so subtly. Like it was‚Ä¶ breathing?

I adjusted my eyes as I leaned in. It wasn‚Äôt very big ‚Äî maybe the size of a tennis ball. It was riddled with holes, craters that left very little room for much else. I couldn‚Äôt help but glare at them.

Then it happened.

1o20spo,https://www.reddit.com/r/horror/comments/1o20spo/the_coffee_table_is_supremely_disappointing_and_a/,The Coffee Table is supremely disappointing and a total waste of time,"I am baffled by people saying they were affected by this. One of the most boring, bland viewings I‚Äôve had recently and I‚Äôm annoyed that I stuck through it. 

People made it seem like they were scarred by it, which is absurd to me. I have no clue how so many people have that take. 

It starts off pretty funny, leading up to the beginning climax which is hilarious. This is where it‚Äôs strange because people seem to be disturbed by it, maybe I‚Äôm jaded but it‚Äôs just a movie.. it‚Äôs not even graphic, and the whole scenario is a comedic moment. 

It‚Äôs a crescendo of how much the dude wants the coffee table to stand his ground, and how much the wife hates it. 
It‚Äôs absolutely hilarious because in that moment, the coffee table itself is more disappointing then he could have imagined from what happens with it, and also it breaks which is the perfect punchline to the whole ‚Äúunbreakable‚Äù claim. 

Up to that point, we had some momentum going. And then NOTHING!!!!! Nothing happens for the rest of the movie!!!

I should have stopped there, and I would have a good impression of the viewing. People saying this was anxiety inducing, I really don‚Äôt see it. 

Was absolutely bored to tears, kept hoping that SOMETHING would finally happen. 

For example: Thelma and Louise, and Very Bad Things have stakes continuously escalating and that‚Äôs where we can actually experience some anxiety because we‚Äôre wondering how the hell they‚Äôre gonna get out of this. 

In this film, all they do is eat dinner and talk about boring life stuff. The stakes never rise, he never really gets danger of being discovered, and the pace of the film is completely dropped after that initial event. 

This pissed me off so bad, because people online gave me the wrong impression. If I saw a rant like this beforehand, I either wouldn‚Äôt watch it, only watch the first 20 minutes, or at least have the expectation that this is just a mediocre snooze fest with a handful of dark comedic beats. 
Wanted to rant so bad, I absolutely hate when time is wasted like this on a mid film and could‚Äôve been spent watching something actually good. 

I read one review that said it ‚Äúwill stick with you‚Äù, and again I‚Äôd agree with that but only the first 20 minutes. It‚Äôs especially annoying because it shows the filmmakers have enough skill to pull of a well crafted opening first act, and then it‚Äôs like they just gave up. 

Watched ‚Äú+1‚Äù last night and it was equally disappointing but at least that was just a dumb teen flick so it has an excuse. 

First time posting here, or writing a movie post. Just so annoyed that people on Reddit made it seem worth watching. 

TL;DR - really solid first act. It‚Äôs funny, too. Actually not a single drop of horror infused here, it‚Äôs just dark comedy. Then after 20 minutes nothing happens and it‚Äôs a waste of time

555 out of a 0-9 range??

The lab doctor who drew my blood said this is the highest she has ever seen. I found a doctor online and am scheduling an appointment tomorrow morning when their phone line is open. Hoping to get in ASAP.

What should I do in the meantime??

OTHER SYMPTOMS? 
In the last year or 2 I've suspected I had PMDD. My hands and feet are always cold. My urine smells bad no matter how hydrated I am, especially after drinking alcohol/coffee. (Drink black coffee nearly every day but only drink alcohol about 3 or 4 times in a year.) I can't think of any other health issues.

To help things here's a step by step road map to learn cooking south indian/tamil nadu food

Step 1
Start with basic stuff. Make your own coffee. Make your own tea - make tea/coffee for the rest of the folks in your house . This will teach you to boil things. 

Step 2
Learn next level things. Making a maggi is so easy. You can also learn different varieties from youtube. This will also teach you to cut vegetables (really the most difficult part) and frying things in a pan or satti. 

Step 3
Level 3 - learn how to prepare dosas. You can buy batter from local shops - in Chennai dosa batter from ID (a bit costly) is the best i would say. Learn to boil rice - these 2 will help you learn how to use a dosa pan and cooker 

Step 4
Level 4 - poriyal/dhal fry- this where the fun begins. Basically everything else you've learnt so far is gonna be useful here. So you might wanna cut vegetables, fry them and learn to add spices and salt in a combination. You will get the combination wrong many times but once you get the hunch you will love your poriyals. 

Step 5
Sambhar - two kinds of sambar are there - one which is simple that doesn't require you to use the mixer. The second one is the one you get in hotels - where you would grind a bunch of spices and coconut in the mixer. Learn these and your almost a pro

Step 6
Any kolambu that takes in tamarind. - puli kolambu is a great cultural phenomenon in tamilnadu. And I would call it the epitome of Tamil food as well. Learn to make this and you are a pro already. Poondu kolambu, vengaya kolambu, meen kolambu are examples 

Step 7
Proper non veg stuff - chocked mutton kolambu, chumma, fried etc etc. 

This is the step by step process to learn cooking by self. It's not just about learning dishes thou - it's also about how to manage and organise things. And especially how you clean the kitchen after. Remember - moms and wives will get mad if we leave the kitchen in ruckus after our experiments. It's necessary you keep the kitchen clean since it's either yourself or you mom/wife who's gonna cook there. ",1,1759999505.0,JKreacts,1,0.6,False

I was surprised‚ÄîI thought that was just a meme and prepared to be disappointed. They were actually very good, not just a good value

Sandwiches: 

1. wife loved the egg salad sandwich and had it multiple times for breakfast. Soft, fluffy bread. I find egg salad disgusting so didn‚Äôt try it

2. tuna salad sandwich‚ÄîI enjoyed this one consistently.

3. Beef, lettuce and wasabi. The beef and wasabi was truly an outstanding roast beef sandwich filling. Lettuce was wilted sadly. Bread was meh, I ate it lengthwise with the filling and threw away the rest of it to cut down on carbs.

Milk‚Äîthe 7-eleven brand milk was way better than meiji or other brands except for a hokkaido milk product from a fancy grocer. It was rich and sweet and creamy. Would make this my daily driver milk in America. 

7-11 brand refrigerated lightly sweetened coffee‚Äînot overly sweet, just a really nice base to make cold lattes.

Drinkable yogurt‚Äînothing amazing, but not overly sweet and very pleasant after getting out of the onsen

Cheese puffs from the heated case next to check out‚Äîreally good, make sure they are microwaved as they are not nearly as good lukewarm. 


Cream puffs filled with custard‚Äîate too many of those

Jersey milk custard‚Äîkinda like a restaurant quality panne cotta. Bought all they had in stock after trying it

The goat was probably the garlic crispy fried chicken‚Äîlegitimately one of the tastiest and juiciest pieces of chicken we have ever had. We went to an upscale yakitori place and it was very good and creative but I was left wondering if I should just have bought a bunch of the garlic chicken at 7-11

Did not like the onigiri‚Äîtoo much rice, and not enough filling but that may be a problem with the food itself rather than the 7-11 rendering of the same 

We had stuff from Lawson and family mart and though they had similar items, they were not nearly as good

I felt bad for the employees. My vague impression was that a lot of retail and service businesses in Japan are overstaffed, but all the 711s seemed understaffed with the very diligent and polite employees doing five jobs at once. ",0,1759999039.0,JapanTravelTips,2,0.33,False

I‚Äôve been partying. I spend most of the day sa coffee shops to study. I visit new places, even when I‚Äôm alone. I‚Äôve been going to the gym. I‚Äôm swimming. Might even try dancing and firing range. I do so many activities in just one day.

1o20k5l,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Liza_Stone143/comments/1o20k5l/why_is_schizophrenia_seen_as_a_problem_rather/,Why is schizophrenia seen as a problem rather than a gift?,"I've been diving deep into mental health discussions lately, and this question keeps popping up in my head: Why do we almost always frame schizophrenia as this heavy burden, a ""disorder"" to be fixed, rather than something that could bring unique gifts or perspectives to the table? Don't get me wrong‚ÄîI'm not romanticizing it or downplaying the real struggles. But in a world that celebrates neurodiversity in things like ADHD or autism (think ""super focus"" or ""pattern-spotting geniuses""), why does schizophrenia get stuck in the villain role?

I wanted to unpack this a bit like a casual chat over coffee, because honestly, the stigma around it feels outdated and unhelpful. If you've got experiences, insights, or pushback, hit me with them‚ÄîI'm all ears (or voices, if that's your vibe). Let's break it down:

[1. The Symptoms Steal the Spotlight (And Not in a Good Way)](https://www.reddit.com/user/Liza_Stone143/comments/1nzaoum/thats_what_i_am_currently_reading_chapter_1/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

Schizophrenia often comes with hallucinations, delusions, or disorganized thinking that can make everyday life feel like navigating a storm. Imagine hearing voices that aren't there during a job interview, or feeling like the world is out to get you when you're just trying to grocery shop. Society sees these as ""problems"" because they disrupt the smooth, predictable flow we all rely on‚Äîwork, relationships, safety.

But here's the flip: Some folks with schizophrenia describe moments of profound insight or creativity amid the chaos. Think artists like Louis Wain, whose cat paintings got wildly abstract (possibly influenced by his own mental health battles), or even modern voices like Elyn Saks, a law professor who openly talks about her schizophrenia as part of her brilliant mind. If we could zoom out, maybe those ""gifts"" are like a double-edged sword‚Äîintense empathy, seeing connections others miss‚Äîbut the pain overshadows it for most people, including those experiencing it.

[2. Stigma: The Real Monster Under the Bed](https://www.reddit.com/user/Liza_Stone143/comments/1nx9nrx/living_well_with_schizophrenia_from_chapter_2/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

Pop culture hasn't helped. Movies like A Beautiful Mind or Shutter Island often portray schizophrenia as scary, unpredictable, or tied to violence (spoiler: most people with it are more likely to be victims than perpetrators). That fear sticks. Add in historical baggage‚Äîlike outdated ideas of ""possession"" or forced institutionalization‚Äîand boom, it's not a ""gift,"" it's a curse.

We're getting better at destigmatizing other conditions (shoutout to the ADHD TikTok army), but schizophrenia still whispers ""hopeless"" or ""untreatable."" What if we reframed it? Some researchers talk about ""positive schizophrenia"" traits, like heightened sensory experiences that fuel innovation. But until we share more stories of thriving (meds, therapy, support systems making it possible), the problem narrative wins.

**3. The Medical Lens: It's a Disease, Not a Superpower**

From a clinical standpoint, schizophrenia is classified as a serious mental illness because it affects about 1 in 300 people worldwide, often starting in young adulthood, and can lead to isolation, unemployment, or worse if untreated. Treatments like antipsychotics help manage symptoms, but side effects (weight gain, fatigue) make it feel like trading one problem for another.

That said, why not a gift? Evolutionary psychologists speculate it might stem from genes that boosted creativity in our ancestors‚Äîsurvival through wild ideas! And in some cultures, what we call ""hallucinations"" are seen as spiritual visions. If we leaned into that, could we support people better? Like, personalized care that honors the ""gift"" parts while tackling the tough stuff.

**So, What's the Takeaway? (And Why I'm Posting This)**

At the end of the day, labeling schizophrenia solely as a ""problem"" robs people of agency and hope. It's both‚Äîand that's okay. The real gift might be in how we, as a community, respond: with curiosity instead of fear, [resources instead of judgment](https://www.reddit.com/user/Liza_Stone143/comments/1nxxtan/living_well_with_schizophrenia_from_chapter_5/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).üñ§",1,1759998741.0,u_Liza_Stone143,0,1.0,False
1o20jzs,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o20jzs,History of the electric kettle.,"Accounts of the first electric kettle's appearance vary. Some sources date it to 1891, others to 1894, and still others to 1900. It is known for certain that by the mid-1890s, the German company AEG was already producing 80 different electrical household and kitchen appliances: kettles, irons, hair dryers, curling irons, electric stoves, coffee makers, cigar lighters, and much more.

Originally, the electric heating element of the kettle was located at the bottom of the body, beneath the base. The large, heavy traditional vessel with a long, curved spout and arched handle was complemented by an electric hotplate.

It wasn't until 1922 that engineers came up with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãplacing a heating element enclosed in a curved tube directly into the water near the bottom of the kettle. Water began to boil significantly faster. At the same time, a safety device was developed that prevented heating even when there was no water in the kettle.

At the end of the last century, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe electric stove was revived: the spiral heating element embedded inside the kettle's body, near the bottom, was replaced by a stainless steel heating element embedded in the bottom. This type of appliance best preserves the natural flavor of the water and significantly reduces scale buildup. It's also safer to use because the heating element doesn't come into contact with the water.

But even more advanced is the disc heater. This is no longer a coil ""glued"" to the bottom, but a flat metal disc with electrical contacts. The disc heater has a higher efficiency and boils water faster.

The traditional ""swan"" shape of the teapot body remained unchanged for several decades. Copper was most often used, later chrome-plated steel, and later still aluminum.

It wasn't until the mid-1950s that new electric kettle shapes appeared: hemispherical and squat cylindrical, with a wide, short spout. By this time, automatic electric models had already been invented, shutting off when boiling thanks to a hidden, bending bimetallic plate.

The jug-shaped teapot design, widely used today, emerged in the late 1970s. Experts worked hard on the spout of this model, ensuring that not a single drop would fall onto the tablecloth.

We take modern electric kettles for granted today. But achieving this wasn't easy. First, they came up with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãconnecting the power supply to the kettle's base with a special, easily detachable electrical connector. The cord no longer became a hindrance when pouring tea into cups.

But the base and its power cord have also undergone interesting changes in a short time. While the connector was initially located on the side of the base, and the kettle could only be placed there one way, today, the much more convenient ""pirouette"" kettles are prevalent. These can rotate on the base thanks to a coaxial contact located in the center. Whether you're right-handed or left-handed, whichever side is most comfortable for you to grip the kettle's handle is the one to use.

You might be unhappy with the short power cord on your electric kettle. But this isn't a drawback, but a safety concern. Pick up the kettle with its power stand: when you're standing, the cord doesn't reach the floor. Imagine how many accidents could occur if it were longer: stepping on the cord and falling while moving the kettle and stand from one place to another; tripping over the cord while the kettle is running; failing to keep an eye on a child tugging at the cord loop while the kettle is boiling... Manufacturers protect us from these horrors, not skimping on cord length. So, never use extension cords or adapters to connect your kettle to the outlet. Such a good kettle deserves a dedicated outlet in a convenient and safe location.

All modern kettles are equipped with an automatic shut-off function when the water boils or when there is no water. Automatic shut-off of the kettle when the water is hot has several advantages: it saves energy and, most importantly, prevents the water from boiling over. Experts recommend boiling water only once, especially tap water. Boiling releases desalinated steam, increasing the salt concentration in the remaining water.

Many recent models have a lid with a locking mechanism, preventing the kettle from being opened unexpectedly. The handle does not get hot when boiling water.

Excessive scale buildup can cause your kettle to shut off before the water boils. Therefore, it's important to regularly descale it with specialized products. If you don't have a ready-made descaler, pour 500 ml of water into the kettle. Add 25 g of lemon juice. Let it sit for 30 minutes. Pour out all the liquid. Rinse with clean water before use. (Do not use descalers containing sulfanilamide or formic acid.)

Many kettles are equipped with removable mesh filters to prevent scale particles from getting into your cups. Three-stage filters are particularly effective, reducing scale deposits in tea by 99 percent.

In the first stage, scale particles that form near the heating element are captured by the circulating water and filtered through the three-stage filter.

In the first stage, scale particles formed near the heating element are captured by the circulating water flow during heating and enter a three-stage filter.

In the second stage, when boiled water is poured from the kettle into a cup, any remaining scale particles are captured by a nylon mesh located near the spout (as in conventional filters).

In the third stage, when the kettle is returned to its stand and returned to an upright position, any remaining scale particles on the nylon mesh enter the filter's area and are captured by a stainless steel mesh.",1,1759998722.0,pubhistory,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm 28M, she‚Äôs 22F (4th year nursing student). We met on a dating app back in July, talked for like two days, then moved to WhatsApp, then Messenger. The app was kind of anonymous, so that‚Äôs where we exchanged real names.

On the 5th day, I decided to take an 8-hour bus ride from Rizal to see her. I brought flowers, we went for coffee and dinner ‚Äî it honestly felt like a proper date. After that, we went to my Airbnb and yeah‚Ä¶ things happened on the first meet.

For context: she came out of a 3-year relationship about 3‚Äì4 months before we met. Her ex cheated on her, and she told me several times she wasn‚Äôt ready for a relationship yet. I told her I was willing to take the risk because I‚Äôd already fallen for her.

When I went back home, we kept talking every day and night. Two weeks later, I traveled back to see her again (another 8-hour ride). This time it was a surprise ‚Äî she didn‚Äôt know I was coming. She was super happy and even admitted she thought I wasn‚Äôt serious about her (probably because we slept together the first time). We spent the night together again, went out, had coffee, dinner, the usual couple stuff. Leaving her again made her sad.

Fast forward a week later, I went back for the 3rd time. She caught me on Messenger with my backpack, so my ‚Äúsurprise‚Äù was ruined. üòÇ This time I stayed for 3 days and we spent a lot of time together. Everything felt right, we were happy.

Eventually, I decided to just move to her city (yep, another 8 hours from my hometown). I rented a place, found a job as a BPO manager with decent pay, and we basically see each other every day now. We eat together, sleep together, she introduced me to her family as a ‚Äúfriend‚Äù (still courting stage), and I‚Äôve even stayed in her room multiple times.

Here‚Äôs the thing ‚Äî she‚Äôs tried to break things off a couple of times, but I begged her to stay. Until now, we still don‚Äôt have a label.

I really love her, but I also want to protect my mental health. I know pain is part of love, but I don‚Äôt want to lose myself in the process.

1o20hqp,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1o20hqp/tifu_by_accidentally_traumatising_a_child_and/,TIFU by accidentally traumatising a child and ruining the trust she had in her mother,"Not today but a few months ago. 

I worked a student job in a more high end shoe store. The kind where you're not allowed to pull shoes from a shelf. You have to wait to be served by a salesperson, get a cup of coffee, we had to put the shoes on the clients feet while kneeling etc. We were trained on every single brand, so if a client had a question, we could even tell you the name of the cow whose leather you're wearing (yes there is a brand that lets you track this). I was selling children's shoes. These were expensive considering that they're meant for kids, but still in a more affordable price range, so I served a more diverse customer base. The owner told us to educate parents and kids as much as possible in terms of foot health and proper fit and to answer every question they might have. So much for the context.

 This incident happened with my first client that I was allowed to serve on my own without any supervision. A mother and her 8 year old daughter came in. I asked if they were buying for a special occasion and if they already had an idea of what they were looking for. The mother said that they want an everyday sneaker but it can't contain any leather. ""Ok that's easy enough for my first client"", I think to myself. I ask the kid some more questions like her favorite color and go get the first three pairs to try on. After like the 4th pair of shoes I've gotten to know them a little better and I asked why they didn't want any leather. Could be a style choice, an allergy or whatever. It's none of those reasons. The girl is actually vegan and doesn't want any animal ""remains"" in her shoes. At this point I knew that I had fucked up and should have just quietly gotten some new pairs to try. The mother was frantically shaking her head at me behind her daughter's back, but the kid asked why the shoes weren't vegan. I had rehersed some explanations and some sort of muscle memory or whatever kicked in. I broke out in a very detailed description about how the glue for most shoes is made (FYI it's made out of horses and/or bunnies). The kid's eyes grew big, she started tearing up and quietly said ""I was trampling on the bunnies?"". At this point I finally shut my mouth but the damage is done. The child is having a full blown existential crisis while her mother tries to console her. It took a while to convince the girl to even touch the floor with her feet again because ""all the people with bunny glue walked over it"". The mother later apologized to me about the chaos and said, that she didn't want her daughter to know about the glue because fully vegan and cruelty free shoes are way out of their price range. She just wanted to avoid leather to please her child without spending a fortune. I still was placed on probation and back under supervision because I failed to properly communicate.

TL;DR: I lectured a child about how shoe glue is made from animals. Turns out the child was vegan and the mother didn't want her to know too much about shoe production so she could safe money.",31,1759998459.0,tifu,14,0.94,False
1o20hkq,https://www.reddit.com/r/toronto/comments/1o20hkq/working_at_cpg_industry_in_toronto_with_science/,Working at CPG industry in Toronto with Science degree,"I'm graduating with a major of Science in Food, Nutrition and Health at UBC (also completed most of the minor courses in Commerce, but not going to complete it due to schedule conflicts with my major requirement courses). I've always wanted to work in the Business field (Marketing/Product and Brand Management/Sales Support/Business analyst) in F&B CPG companies like Nestle, General Mills, Mondelez, etc. So I've been building my resume (internship, research project assistant, case comp etc.) related to these roles, and thought I could integrate my experiences into my science background so I could work in the field where I have skills in business but knowledge in food science.

However, when it's time to get a job, I feel like my resume is not appealing to any sector, neither business nor science. I never hear back from applications, even though I had a full page of experiences, got my resume proofreading multiple times, lots of advice from coffee chats, and I barely took a break ever since I started uni, because I wanted to fill in my resume other than just studying science. (I focused on building my resume rather than having a good GPA, also I haven't thought about a master's degree, so my GPA is really bad honestly...)To compete with business majors, my degree and experiences are not strong or appealing enough, and I didn't have time & know about networking since I had to survive in the first two years at UBC Science studying molecules and organic chemistry, while business majors are taught to make connections and to build their practical skills in lectures. 

So I'm just totally lost with my career plan right now, I have 2 months left until graduation. I realized with my bachelor's degree, I really can't do anything... So I'm considering getting a diploma from public colleges in Toronto. It seems like Toronto colleges have many programs offering, better job opportunities and a lot more CPG industry networking environment compared to Vancouver. 

I have 2 pathways on my mind:

1. Get a diploma in Food Science Technology / Biotechnology or Food Safety certificate from colleges in Ontario like Centennial or Conestoga, and land in the CPG industry with Food Safety QA job as a stepping stone, then reposition myself into internal business roles.

2. Get a diploma in business, like marketing and analytics, in Ontario while networking consistently. Then try to get a job there.

  
I'm actually exhausted and not confident about myself to compete against business major people with a great resume anymore so I'm afraid to consider option 2. I feel like even if I get the business diploma, I have to compete against people with an MBA, people with a data/analysis degree since bachelors, or etc, who have a more straightforward resume that really tells where they are fit as an entry-level job. I know there are people out there who have a different career other than their major, but that's mostly after they got a job and repositioned their role internally and these days job market is so bad that I feel like I really need to fit in myself into a specific way to get the FIRST job.

  
PLEASE, PEOPLE IN THE JOB FIELD, PLEASE TELL ME THE TRUTH ABOUT THE REAL JOB MARKET AND ADVISE ME ABOUT MY CAREER PLAN. ANYTHING, ANY ADVICE, ANY RECOMMENDATION. What should I do between those 2 options? Of course I will keep applying to both business marketing and FSQA if there is any gap between my graduation and diploma registration.",2,1759998437.0,toronto,0,0.63,False

like one night he sent me ‚Äúyou‚Äôre one of the few who really listens in class, i like that.‚Äù and i didn‚Äôt think too much of it but then he started calling me ‚Äúsmart girl‚Äù or ‚Äúhey you, genius‚Äù and kinda teasing me sometimes. he even reacts to my instagram stories, like if i post coffee he‚Äôs like ‚Äúyou didn‚Äôt invite me ‚òïüòÖ‚Äù or ‚Äúyou always look so tired, take care okay.‚Äù it‚Äôs not exactly inappropriate but it‚Äôs definitely not something my other teachers do lol

and tbh he‚Äôs cute, like really cute. i‚Äôd be lying if i said i didn‚Äôt like the attention. he‚Äôs funny too and when we talk it just feels easy. but then i start feeling weird cause he‚Äôs still my teacher‚Ä¶ and i don‚Äôt wanna get in trouble or be that student who crossed a line.

so idk what to do. part of me likes him, but another part is like ‚Äúthis is wrong, stop entertaining it.‚Äù he hasn‚Äôt said anything explicitly flirty or sexual, but it‚Äôs definitely getting there. should i distance myself before it gets messy? or just keep things friendly?",1,1759998393.0,Advice,5,1.0,False

Staal, 18, drafted 2nd overall months before his NHL debut, lasted the full season despite many expecting the Penguins to only give him the proverbial nine cups of coffee and sending him back to the OHL. Staal was simply too good to demote and ended up being nominated for the Calder Trophy won by teammate Evgeni Malkin.

Letang, 19,  played seven games before the Penguins returned him to Val D'Or in the QMJHL. He would win gold at the World Juniors that winter as captain of the Canadian team, their third of five straight U20 World Championship titles.

(Crosby ofc, was drafted at 17, and was barely 18 the year before when he made the team, so the Pens actually had three teenagers to start 2006-7).

The only other teenagers who made the Penguins opening night roster since Staal and Letang were Olli Maatta and Daniel Sprong, but in different seasons.
