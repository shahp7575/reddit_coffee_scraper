1l9irso,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1l9irso/i_was_in_a_relationship_for_less_than_24hrs/,I was in a relationship for less than 24hrs,"This happened about 2 years ago. For context, we were both living in the same European city. Throwaway account.

Basically, I (30/M) was dating Veronica (29/F), fake name, for about two months. During that time we grew very close. We communicated well and were honest about past relationships and our boundaries. We discussed what we wanted in the future, including that we both wanted kids, and that we could see ourselves living abroad for year somewhere else in Europe.

We connected emotionally, psychologically, and sexually. We regularly went on dates, hung out together, met each others friends, stayed over at each others apartments. Things were good. About a month into dating, Veronica said she liked the direction we were going in, but she wanted to take things slow. I wasn't entirely sure what this meant, but assumed maybe she wanted to continue dating other people. This was fine by me. I had been dating other people, but I had stopped after about two weeks into dating because I was spending so much time with Veronica already.

One day, after about 8 weeks, we met for coffee at a cafe. We had plans for a full day of activities - a walk in a beautiful park, dinner at a cute restaurant, a trip to the cinema, back to mine for dinner and she would stay over.

Over coffee, Veronica asked whether I was comfortable saying that we were officially in a relationship and that we would start calling each other boyfriend and girlfriend. I said of course. She said she was happy, but wanted to know if this was what I genuinely wanted. She said she had seen that many men just wants to be in a ""situationship"" and not commit to relationship. I explained I was genuinely super happy and that a relationship was what I wanted. I had falled for Veronica super hard. We had not said, ""I love you"" yet, but we were definitely heading in that direction.

Veronica wanted to know why we hadn't become a couple earlier. I was honest and said that I probably would have asked her to make things official earlier, but she told me wanted to take things slow and I had agreed. I explained that I hadn't fully understood what she meant by ""taking things slow"" because it's quite a broad expression and I thought it meant she didn't want to be in a relationship straight away. She didn't elaborate on what she has meant.

I said I wanted to be in a committed and exclusive relationship with her. I said I was confident about liking and trusting her, so this was the perfect moment to make things official. I said we should take time to talk more about what we both wanted for our futures to make sure we were on the same page on everything, but it seemed like we were aligned on most thing. We had already discussed many of our ambitions and about what was important to us in a relationship, but there was definitely scope to talk more. We discussed the fact that we were happy with how well we were communicating and that we should keep this going, especially sharing our thoughts and feelings, even the negative ones. We continued the conversation back-and-forth for a little while at the cafe and we were both smiling and laughing a lot because this was a significant romantic moment. We has even started calling each other boyfriend and girlfriend.We left the cafe holding hands and continued our great day together.

When we got back to mine, after dinner, we watched a horror film. I found parts of it a little disturbing, but overall I liked the film. I like horror films a lot. Before dating Veronica, my last girlfriend of nearly 7 years hated watching horror, so I always watched by myself. (The former relationship had been over for about a year at this point).

As we watched the horror film, I felt myself feeling emotional because I was happy that I had found a person that I could now watch horror films with and I could call her my girlfriend. I was also feeling a sense of hurt about the fact that my ex never shared this passion with me. I was thinking about how amazing Veronica was and how we were such a good match for each other and that I loved our dynamic and how I could see her being the person I could spend the rest of my life with. I also began thinking about how Veronica and I had discussed the fact that both of us would like to live in another country for awhile. I was curious to learn where she had in mind, because we had both said somewhere in Europe.

Veronica noticed when we were to going bed that I looked like I was thinking deeply. She was right. I had a lot going through my head. I told her about my feelings and she seemed happy that I shared.

It felt good to share and have my emotions validated. Then I said I was curious to know where else she would like to live in Europe. She said she always imagined herself living in France. This was great, because this was a country on my list too. I shared my enthusiasm and said it would be such a cool adventure. I then explained that my job let me do career breaks and that it offered secondment opportunities in different parts of Europe, including in France, so it was definitely something I would be interested in doing in the future and that it could be something we could do together.

I then saw a side of Veronica I had never seen before. She became super angry and demanded to know how long I'd been making this plan to go live in another country. I explained it was just an idea and that I had several options available to me, but it would depend on a lot of factors, like if I could line-up a job before I moved and whether I could get a decent salary. She accused me already having a plan to leave the country and abandon her. I was super shocked at this reaction. I explained that I was merely looking into options and that I had not committed to anything at all, which was completely true. I had no concrete plans and I had not applied to any jobs. I also could not move with the next year because of a contractual arrangement with my employer. I explained these points to Veronica.

Veronica then accused me of bringing up the idea of moving to another country as a convenient way for me to be able to dumb her in the future. I replied this was not the case. I reminded her we previously had a conversation where we both expressed a desire to live in another country in Europe for a year. I tried to emphasise that this was all hypothetical, since I had no plan to move and it was purely an idea and that I might never happen.

Veronica continued to be irritated and angry with me. We talked long into the night, but eventually we both became super tired and agreed to go to sleep and talk more in the morning. I was hoping that the next day, Veronica would be less aggressive and more understanding.

Boy was I wrong.

The next morning she was still full of anger. She said I was obviously not interested in a committed relationship with her because I was already making plans to leave the country without her. I explained again that I had no plans, that it was only an idea and that obviously since I was now in a relationship, that would impact on my future decisions, hence why I was discussing with her my idea of maybe moving to another European country. I also explained that if I ever moved to another country, I would not make a decision to leave without making sure my partner was comfortable with the decision and I would want my partner to move with me.

Veronica and I discussed things for about an hour and she finally concluded I was not interested in a committed relationship with her. She accused me again of only discussing moving to another country because I could use it as an excuse to break up with her whenever I wanted. I told her that her assessment was wrong, but it seemed like I could not change her mind. She said she never wanted to talk to me again and left my apartment.

That's how the relationship came to an end in less than 24 hours.

To say I was in complete shock would be an understatement. I couldn't believe what happened. I hoped that maybe within a day or two Veronica would change her mind. She never contacted me again. And I never contacted her.

I talked the situation over with multiple friends at the time and they said she sounded massively insecure and told me I was lucky to not be in a relationship with her. I knew she was an anxious person and that she had been stuck with an awful boyfriend in the past, so my guess is that she has some unresolved trauma or trust issues from that prior relationship. That's just my amateur psychologist/psychotherapist attempt to understand why she behaved the way she did.

This honestly goes down as one of the weirdest moments of my life.

I do sometimes wonder what would have happened between us if we had been able to maintain the relationship for longer. My friends say she probably would have freaked out about something else at some stage and ended things.

Postscript: I did eventually bump into Veronica about a year and a half later at a grocery store. We chatted for about 5mins and it was a nice encounter. We did not talk about the past, just asked how each other was doing. We followed up with a few slightly flirtatious messages, but the conversation fizzled out and we haven't spoken since.

TLDR Veronica and I decided to make our relationship official. When I brought up the topic of possible future plans to live in another European country she accused me of not being committed to the relationship with her and broke up with me. All of this happened within less than 24hrs, so we were in an ""official"" relationship for less than a day.",1,1749723111.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False

Or thinking crazy......,"So I'm horrible at my potential interpretation of clues/hints from the book and especially the series.  I almost wish I'd never seen the show because at this point I have too many interpretations.  To my knowledge I haven't seen too many theories on what the clock times could represent, well nothing solid anyways and I am one that gets into confirmation bias and will force it like the wrong puzzle piece.   I have minimum of 8 potential interpretations of each ""clue"".....and yeah it's lonely in crazy town.  See below for just one of the clues......all of mine are like this....anyone else?  

Two cups of coffee hint: 
1. Hint that we're looking for doubles of something
2. Hint that we're supposed to see what the handles are pointing at
3. Hint that we need to look for words with double letters in them
4.  Hint for Look for coffee named creeks or mountains (yes there are some). I found a coffee cup lake and thought for sure it was the checkpoint.
5.  Hint to Reread entire book and look for any mention of him drinking coffee or mentioning of coffee (5 stories just FYI). 
6.  See a story that describes the Blackfoot River as being ""coffee"" colored and get convinced it means something HUGE 
7.  Hint to use the sink to clear the cups.   Think it's a hint to Sinks Canyon and think myself brilliant for catching it.
8. Hint to make anagram from the word coffee, not seeing one then look for FF and EE doubles in the book. 
9. Hint to look for Brown like In Fenns hunt....coffee is Brown so research every area named Brown or would be considered/described as being Brown.  

10.  Not a hint.....he forgot to take the cup when he went to the kitchen and just grabbed a new mug (I actually have more faith in this being the answer). 

Don't get me started on the pictures or the safe code.  Like I'll take up everyone's next two days with my research.   I felt like Russel Crow in that movie "" A beautiful Mind"", except I'm not a genius and haven't received a Nobel Prize....but yeah just like him.

Hi Charlotte and Mike congratulations I hope your wedding is as beautiful as you guys 
I need some help . The story might be not an order as I have ADHD and tend to add bits in later when I remember. 
I am feeling extremely torn! 
I (30f) and my husband (29m) I’ve been romantically involved on and off for 17 years we were high school sweethearts got together at 13 separated , in college got back together a couple years, I moved so we broke up I mean rekindled due to friends dating and reunion.. we had been together for about 10 years, but last August I left him. We were together, we got married we have a daughter (3f) everything was good. Although he had a gambling problem and did not deal with stress well this caused a lot of friction a lot of fighting a lot of stress due to this gambling problem we then had to move eight hours up north .we did discuss this, it was his choice to come. I gave him the option of me just moving in with mum for a couple of months and we would look for a council house while’s sorted out his issues. Has told me he wanted to move close to my mum as she was the best support for him. (His parents were emotionally unavailable and make him feel like a failure.) the stress and the homesickness was too much we were fighting in front of everybody the baby the siblings the parents so I asked him to leave we have now been split a year however we have both not acted as if we are single we have both been with each other multiple times. This year he has been in my house more than he has been in his own. ( when I left him, he moved back in with his parents eight hours drive away.) I have never said he cannot come as I understand he is stressed and sad and just wants his daughter. But now I have probably had time to myself about 5/6 weeks of the year I would really like to stay single this year. Go on a couple of dates figure out who I really am but I feel my husband is pushing to get back with him because he is very lonely and very sad. This week we have both SHed and he is extremely depressed and struggling last week he did not want to be here! I am texting a couple of new people and I am having feelings for someone although they keep ghosting every few days. I know they are busy but I am also needy and if I’m going to fall for someone I do need consistency but I am worried that my husband is making me feel awful because he wants to be back with me! I have set boundaries he is not to come into my bedroom. I do not want to be touched. I can give him a hug if he is sad but he is kind of taking advantage a little bit of that. He is spiteful so we have just planned a holiday together as this is something I really wanted to do and he thought I would need some company. When we were together, he did everything for me paid the direct debit bills set up anything I needed to set up social media phones Work he would do it all for me instead of teach me how to do it now that I am single in my own house with my own bills I’m finding everything extremely hard. I did not realise how many different things there were to Adulting but when he’s here I feel like a small girl again. I’m not sure if I want to get back with him because right now he is not the man I married however I know he has potential and I know we can be really good friends. I just don’t know if we can be friends if he wants more should I kick him out? Should I help him? He was telling me that I should not be texting another man because it hurts him and that’s not focusing on myself and trying to figure out who I am and it’s definitely not trying to parent my daughter.! But I also think I need to be who I am and teach my daughter that it’s okay to be whoever you are! I am a massive people pleaser. I have done everything for everybody else and I just want some time for me. I need to figure out who I am in order to show my daughter what a role model looks like the role model she’s looking at is definitely not what I want her to be. We are always shouting and crying and I feel like this is what we were like when we were together he doesn’t know how to talk. He cannot express himself and he just gets extremely sad and pack his bags to prove a point last night I said go on then and he realised he did not have anywhere to go. He does not want to go to his parents and it’s not quite paid there yet so he doesn’t have any fuel money because he gambled everything Again. He normally helped me out with childcare and he does normally give me money when I ask my payments have not been right so I am now £700 in arrears with childcare. I said I could pay 500 if he could pay the extra 200 due to me texting this new guy he is effing and blinding. Why the hell should I? Blah blah blah as much as I understand his point I’m also finding it very hard because he will flip from one to the other he told me I will have an expensive bag for my birthday. He has always bought me material things so now it’s habit although it’s not what I wantand he is now calling me golddigger slut ( not those actual words, but he is implying everything) he’s also talking to me and labelling me something that I know for a fact I’m not he’s talking to me as if he doesn’t know me! This is extremely painful for me because if he genuinely sees me like that, why on earth is he in my house?! I have put my life on pause to help him and I am scared that my daughter will grow up and I will still be on and therefore not teaching her the right qualities in life right now. I think we are teaching her that her feelings are not valid and aggression is how you get heard! I want to teach her how to become and proud of who she is and set boundaries and if nobody likes those boundaries they can leave they don’t fit in her life. I don’t want her to be a people please though who puts yourself in danger just so someone else doesn’t react badly or it feels better! It’s really messing up my mental health. The in-laws have been less than helpful and have never liked me in the 15 years. I’ve been in his life. I’ve never been heard. I’ve always been judged and manipulated and this year I just wanted to end.!! I would love my husband to be my best friend however I am not feeling romantic with him right now due to how stressed he is he is a completely different person to the guy I know! I don’t know what to do. Do I stop what I’m doing? Stop the texting with other others. Coffee dates with my best friend stop trying to find out who I am because he is struggling  outside more than I am or do I kick him to the curb and saying not my problem? I’m really torn and it is making me so depressed that I am sick of Work ! somebody please help me but be kind. Thanks in advance. RJ",1,1749722990.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False

1l9ipm0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_somebodyelse_/comments/1l9ipm0/best_coffee_makers/,Best Coffee Makers,"If you're serious about your coffee, your machine matters. I’ve gone through models that cater to different needs—whether you like to keep it simple, prefer full control, or need something that works with pods. Here are my top five picks:

[**Technivorm Moccamaster KBGV**](https://techgurureviews.com/technivorm-moccamaster-53930-kbgv-coffee-maker/)

A favorite among coffee purists, the Moccamaster delivers smooth, balanced coffee every time. It uses a pump-free system to heat water to the optimal brewing temperature and completes a full pot (40 oz) in just 4–6 minutes. The brew-volume selector is great for small or large batches, and the auto shut-off and 5-year warranty add extra peace of mind.

[**Fellow Aiden Precision Drip Coffee Maker**](https://techgurureviews.com/fellow-aiden-precision-drip-coffee-maker-is-it-worth-the-hype/)

Looks modern, brews like a pro. The Aiden gives you temperature precision, a bloom cycle, and a thermal carafe that keeps your coffee hot for hours. It supports both single serve and full batches without compromising flavor. One-touch brewing, a removable water tank, and even a schedule feature make it a solid smart pick.

[**Breville Precision Coffee Machine**](https://techgurureviews.com/breville-precision-brewer-drip-coffee-machine/)

This one’s a dream for control freaks. You get six brewing modes—Gold, Strong, Fast, Cold Brew, Iced, and a fully customizable My Brew setting. It uses PID temperature control and gives you options to adjust bloom time, flow rate, and filter type. Whether you want floral pour-over or a bold pot, it nails it every time.

[**Ninja DualBrew Pro CFP301**](https://techgurureviews.com/ninja-dualbrew-pro-cfp301-drip-coffee-maker/)

If your household mixes pods and grounds, this is your all-in-one solution. Brew K-Cups or full carafes, choose from four brew styles (Classic, Rich, Over Ice, or Specialty), and even use the built-in frother. It’s got a dedicated hot water system for soups or tea, and the adjustable reservoir fits wherever you need it.

[**OXO Brew 8 Cup**](https://techgurureviews.com/oxo-brew-8-cup-coffee-maker-is-it-worth-the-investment/)

For those who want great coffee without too many settings. It’s SCA-certified and delivers both single cups and carafes with even water distribution thanks to the Rainmaker showerhead. It has a thermal carafe, compact size, and precision temperature control. Bonus: it fits under most cabinets.

**Verdict**

If you want a simple, reliable brew every morning, the Technivorm Moccamaster or OXO Brew 8 Cup are great picks. For more advanced control and café-level results, go for the Fellow Aiden or Breville Precision Brewer. And if you need flexibility with pods, grounds, and multiple brew sizes, the Ninja DualBrew Pro delivers serious versatility.",1,1749722884.0,u_somebodyelse_,0,1.0,False

Every single day, my boyfriend will wake up in a mood with me. It's not just that he's not a morning person because it lasts all day and he doesn't come downstairs until at least 10 am anyway. I don't think I've done anything that could be triggering this and he always says I haven't annoyed him but he's always so snappy at me and speaks to me the way you'd speak to an annoying sibling you live with.
I've tried loads of stuff to combat this; I've tried making him a coffee and bringing it up to him every morning, I've tried keeping the house as quiet as possible so he can get extra sleep (2 kids and 2 dogs, so can get a bit noisy), I've tried cleaning the house so it's almost spotless when he wakes up (minus vacuuming because that's loud), I've tried doing all the tasks he's said need doing the night before. During the day, I tend to stay in a different part of the house because in my mind, I can't annoy someone if I'm not around them. When we do spend time together, which I'll admit is rarely now because I'm so worried about him getting annoyed at me, I barely touch him or speak to him. I basically only speak when spoken to and only touch him if he asks or initiates it. I'm at a loss of what to do. It wasn't always like this. We used to cuddle all the time, we used to have endless conversations about nothing and everything, and he didn't used to wake up angry with me.
Is it something I'm doing? How am I annoying him so much? It's like my mere presence annoys him. 
I don't want to just leave because I love him so much but I really don't know how to fix this, especially as he won't even talk to me about what's going on, I have tried but he always says I'm not annoying him but proceeds to be even more snappy at me after I ask.

Clarissa sat in a cafe with the lawyer, recalling what happened yesterday.

“Mrs. Daniel, your husband’s frozen sperm, stored here at the hospital, was taken five years ago. It was donated to Ms. Gabrielle Hawkins. Didn’t he tell you?”

Clarissa Daniel’s smile froze the second she heard that name. For a moment, she thought she’d misheard and asked again in an unsteady voice, “Is it possible there was a mistake? My husband’s name is Norris Daniel.”

The doctor tapped the keyboard a few more times, double-checking. Then he looked up and said firmly, “There’s no mistake. I can still remember, when Ms. Hawkins gave birth, Mr. Daniel even sent a thank-you banner to the hospital.”

The words hit her like a blow. Her hand, resting on the wheelchair arm, slipped off, powerless, then a buzzing filled her ears.

Five years ago, she and Norris got married.

Back then, he’d told her he didn’t want her to suffer through childbirth, and had volunteered to get a vasectomy. She’d been so touched by his thoughtfulness back then.

Still, fearing he might regret it one day, she insisted he freeze some sperm first, just in case.

Lately, He was under great pressure from his parents. In order to help him share the pain, she also wanted to have a child of their [own.So](http://own.so/), she came to the hospital on her own, planning to surprise him with a pregnancy.

But instead, he’d surprised her first.

And the name Gabrielle chilled her to the bone.

Gabrielle was the older girl from next door, whom Norris had secretly loved for fifteen years. He’d planned a grand confession before she went overseas, only to be flat-out rejected.

It was during that heartbreak that Clarissa stayed by his side, warming him with her sunny optimism. Eventually, they got married.

She truly believed he’d moved on, that he’d fallen in love with her.

Now she realized he never had. He never let go of Gabrielle. Clarissa was just the consolation prize in a sad little game she played with herself.

The doctor noticed the sudden change in her complexion and asked a few concerned questions.

Clarissa forced a smile. “I’m fine,” she murmured, wheeling herself out of the hospital and heading home.

Still in a daze, she pushed the door open, assuming the place was empty, until the faint clinking of glasses reached her from the balcony.

“Norris, are you really going through with the divorce? Clarissa’s been with you for five years. Don’t you love her even a little?”

Norris’s voice was lazy, almost indifferent as he replied, “When Gabrielle needed me to get married for the sake of her stability, I agreed. But now she doesn’t need that anymore. And I don’t want to keep Clarissa tied to me out of guilt. That’s the only reason I married her in the first place.”

The voice on the balcony paused, then asked again, more seriously, “Does Clarissa know you and Gabrielle have a child together? She loves you so much. If you really divorce her, I bet she’ll disappear without a trace. You’ll never find her again.”

Norris chuckled. “She doesn’t need to know about the kid. A few days ago, I told her the company’s in trouble and that we needed to fake a divorce. Once she gets used to the idea, I’ll tell her the truth. She’ll understand. Besides, look at her legs. Where can she even go?”

Clarissa felt like her brain had exploded.

'A fake divorce?' The words echoed in her head.

She had believed him, believed the crisis was real. She even gave him the last of her dowry savings to help him through it.

But it was all a lie.

A choked sob rose in her throat, and her chest tightened as if pierced by needles.

She had been planning a future with him, thinking about surprising him on their anniversary.

But he had already erased her from his plans. Guilt was all it took to sum up her ten-year crush and five-year marriage.

She thought she had finally won his heart. Turned out, she was just a placeholder in his love story with someone else.

Looking down at her lifeless legs and remembering the pain she endured to save him, she realized how foolish she’d been.

Instantly, grief turned into rage.

Clarissa suddenly started pounding her legs with her fists, tears splashing onto her thighs, hot and unstoppable.

Suddenly, the voices on the balcony fell silent.

Clarissa froze. She hadn’t meant for them to hear. Panicking, she turned the wheelchair and headed for the front door.

A moment later, Norris came over. His expression flickered with surprise, and his voice dripped with false concern.

“Clarissa, when did you get back? You should’ve called, I’d have come to get you. What did the doctor say?”

She looked at his eyes full of love, but then her eyes welled up again.

Alarmed, Norris reached out, trying to wipe away her tears. “What’s wrong? It’s okay. If you don’t get better, I’ll take care of you forever.”

Clarissa stared into his eyes again, trying to find even a shred of real affection in his eyes. But in the end, she couldn’t bear to know and looked away.

Sniffling softly, she casually asked, “Norris, I’ve been thinking… I’d really like to have a child with you. It’s a good thing we froze some sperm back then. Do you think you can come with me to the hospital sometime soon?”

Upon hearing that, his face changed instantly. He avoided eye contact and mumbled something, clearly trying to change the subject.

“Why bring that up all of a sudden? I don’t want you to suffer through pregnancy. I’d feel awful. Besides, didn’t we agree to travel the world together? Hard to do that with a baby.”

Seeing how uncomfortable he looked, Clarissa closed her eyes. She had her answer.

She slumped slightly in her chair and said, “I’m tired. Can you carry me to the bedroom?”

He nodded and helped her inside. Once he was gone, Clarissa reached for her phone.

“Auntie,” she said quietly, “I’ve made up my mind. I want to go to the Netherlands with you.”

Her aunt's excited voice came through the speaker, but the joy didn’t last long.

“This time… how long are you planning to stay? Don’t tell me you’ll come running back after two days because you miss your husband again.”

Clarissa’s heart clenched. She whispered, “Permanently.”

There was a pause on the other end. Then her aunt’s voice came back, warm and full of resolve. “Okay, then. I’ll start the immigration paperwork.”

After hanging up, Clarissa made another call. But at that time, to her lawyer.

She was done waiting.

Her love couldn’t warm a heart that never opened to her. If Norris wanted a real divorce, then she’d give him exactly what he wanted.

She would turn this fake divorce into a real one and make his lies come true.

End of memories.

Once Clarissa made up her mind to leave Norris for good, she didn’t waste any time. Ahe met with a lawyer to sort through their shared assets and financials.

By the time she was ready to head home, a sudden downpour had started. However, she hadn’t brought a driver today and had just hailed a cab to the quiet little coffee shop where she met her lawyer. Now, with the heavy rain coming down in sheets and barely a car in sight, Clarissa found herself stuck.

She’d wait under the awning for the rain to pass and kindly refused her offer to help.

Hours passed, but the rain didn’t let up. It only grew heavier as the sky turned from gray to pitch-black. As such, her legs, still recovering, began to ache. With no other option, she finally pulled out her phone and called him.

“Norris,” she said softly, “can you come pick me up?”

The urgency in his voice was immediate. He barely got out a few words before hanging up, promising he was on his way.

That call sparked a small warmth in her chest.

Maybe he still cared. Maybe not everything between them was a lie. Could she give him one last chance?

But just as he turned the corner from his street, Norris’s phone buzzed with a message that froze him in place.

\[Gabrielle: Norris, I’m back.\]

His heart skipped a beat. Without hesitation, he pulled over, sent a quick message to his driver, and spun the car around. The tires screeched as he sped off, heading straight for the airport.

Back in the rain, Clarissa sat in her wheelchair, rehearsing in her mind what she would say to him. She’d tell him about her fears, her confusion, the aching need to believe they could still make this work.

But night fell, the storm quieted to a drizzle, and rain pooled around the base of her wheels, yet Norris never came.

Her heart sank deeper and deeper, until it felt like it had hit rock bottom.

She called him again, but there was no answer. Still, she tried again, and finally, someone picked up. But it wasn’t him.

A woman’s voice, soft, almost pleading, echoed from the other end.

“Norris, do you really not love me anymore?”

After a brief silence came Norris’s voice, low and tight with emotion.

“Gabrielle... I’m married now.”

The woman didn’t back down and asked, “But you still came for me, didn’t you? Then tell me, why would you leave your wife, who’s only five kilometers away, just to drive thirty kilometers to pick me up?”

Clarissa’s whole body went still.

She opened her mouth, tried to speak, but no sound came. Her throat burned, words trapped behind pain.

At that moment, panic set in. She wanted to hang up, to stop hearing this, but her trembling hand accidentally hit the speaker button instead.

Norris’s voice rang out clearly as he replied, “Yes. I can’t forget you. Are you happy now?”

Clarissa’s breath caught, stunned. And then, the unmistakable sound of lips meeting rang out from the other end.

In a hurry, her hand fumbled as she ended the call, but in the chaos, the phone slipped and landed in the water. She reached for it without thinking and forgot all about her damaged legs.

She fell hard onto the pavement, right into the cold rain.

For a moment, she lay there, frozen. The storm kept beating down on her, soaking her completely. And then, something inside her broke.

She buried her face in her arms and sobbed.

Fifteen years, she had loved a man who only had eyes for someone else.

Five years of marriage, only to find out it had all been built on guilt and that she had merely been a placeholder.

""Why? Why..."" she whispered over and over, her voice cracking through the rain like a broken song.

Her tears blended with the rain, her pain heavier than the cold that seeped into her bones. And eventually, darkness took her.

When Clarissa finally woke up, she was in a hospital bed.

She blinked slowly, disoriented. A glance at the clock told her it was already noon the next day.

Her phone, which someone had carefully dried out overnight, sat on the bedside table, fully functional, but still silent. No messages. Not a single word from him.

She sat up, just about to call for the discharge paperwork, when the door opened.

She turned her head, a flicker of hope sparking in her eyes, only to see the driver walk in.

The light in her eyes faded instantly.

“Mrs. Daniel,” he greeted awkwardly. “Mr. Daniel’s car got stuck last night, so he asked me to pick you up. How are you feeling?”

Clarissa forced a smile and nodded. The excuse was pathetic, but she didn’t want to make things harder for the driver. So, she simply said, “I’m alright. Let’s go home.”

As such, he quickly took care of the discharge and brought her back.

When they reached the front door, she sat outside for a long time, trying to pull herself together. Only after smoothing out her expression and faking a smile did she open the door.

But the moment she pushed it open, she heard a voice inside.

“Norris, look how much Matthew looks like you.”

Chapter 2

Third Person's POV

Clarissa’s hands froze on the wheels of her chair, stuck in the entryway, unable to go any further.

But Norris’s voice still reached her ears.

“Gabrielle,” he said firmly, “I don’t want to hear you say things like that again, especially not when Clarissa is around.”

Gabrielle’s smile stiffened for a moment. She brushed her hair behind her ear and murmured, “Alright.But one day you will tell her the truth that your divorce is not a fake one but a real one.”

Clarissa stood frozen by the door. Her heart thudded in her chest as she turned to leave, desperate to get out, but in her panic, she bumped hard into the shoe cabinet.

Silence filled the room, and then came hurried footsteps.

Moments later, Norris appeared in front of her, holding a child in his arms.

Clarissa looked up and, unexpectedly, found herself agreeing with what Gabrielle had said earlier. The child really did look like him.

When Norris saw the redness in her eyes, his heart skipped a beat. He quickly set the child down and knelt in front of her, taking her hand in his.

“Clarissa, what happened? My car broke down last night, so I asked the driver to pick you up. Where did you go? Why did he take so long getting you home? If he can’t even do his job right, I’ll just find someone else.”

His concern sounded caring, but every word pierced her like a thorn. She gave a bitter laugh. He hadn’t even bothered to coordinate his lies with the driver.

She had thought she'd grown numb to all of this, that she wouldn’t feel the pain anymore.

But her heart still ached.

Turning away, she wiped the tears from the corner of her eyes and forced a smile. “It’s nothing worth fussing over. I was with a friend.”

Norris visibly relaxed. “As long as you were with someone you trust. When did you get home? I didn’t hear a thing.”

And just like that, Clarissa understood.

All that faux concern was just a setup for this question.

He wanted to know if she’d overheard anything she wasn’t supposed to.

The warmth inside her turned cold. She pulled her hand back and replied calmly, “I just got in. I didn’t hear a thing.”

Norris’s smile faltered, and his hand hung awkwardly in the air. Even so, he didn’t press the issue.

Clarissa looked past him and noticed the woman still standing behind.

Norris quickly stood and explained, “Clarissa, Gabrielle just got back here and doesn’t have a place to stay. Coincidentally, she’s also become my mom’s new doctor, so I let her stay here for now. Don’t get it wrong.”

The way he tried to defend Gabrielle was so natural and instinctive, extinguishing the last flicker of hope in Clarissa’s chest.

She looked away and clenched her fists, trying to maintain a shred of dignity. “I understand. I’m tired. I’d like to rest now.”

Norris was caught off guard by her composure. A strange feeling tugged at him, but he didn’t dwell on it. Assuming she just needed sleep, he moved to wheel her into the master bedroom.

But she stopped him, saying, “I want to go to my own room.”

In that instant, he froze.

Clarissa didn’t understand why he’d suddenly halted until Gabrielle stepped forward, child in tow, and pointed toward a door.

“You mean that room?” she asked, her tone light, but her words sharp. “That used to be my room when I lived here. I’m used to it, so Norris said I could have it again.”

She called him with such familiarity that it made Clarissa’s stomach turn. More than that, she heard the deliberate challenge in Gabrielle’s voice.

Clarissa turned her head slowly, searching Norris’s expression, hoping for a word of support.

But he offered none.

“It’s just a room,” he said with a shrug. “If Gabrielle wants it, then let's just let her be. I’ll just get the guest room cleaned up for you.”

Clarissa shut her eyes for a moment, fighting back the tide of hurt swelling in her chest.

That room was the one he had carefully decorated for her right after they married. He’d given it to her because he knew her parents had died young, and she had no family to go back to.

He told her that the room would be her sanctuary. If she was ever angry with him and didn’t want to talk, she could go there, and he’d know to come make things right.

But now, he’d given it away like it meant nothing.

Like it was just a room.

Clarissa pressed her hand to her chest, trying to ease the tight, suffocating ache.

Then, firmly insisted, “No. I want that room.”

Third Person's POV

As soon as the words left her mouth, the atmosphere in the room grew heavy.

Norris’s brows furrowed. He couldn’t understand why Clarissa was making such a fuss over a room. Before he could say anything, Matthew came running over.

He charged straight at Clarissa, waving his arms and hitting her legs and face with tiny but surprisingly sharp blows.

“You’re a bad person! A bad lady! Don’t bully my mom! That’s my mom’s room!”

Though small, the boy’s strikes had force behind them. Clarissa’s legs throbbed from the impact. Just as she reached out to push him away, he yanked her hair instead. Pain shot through her scalp, and she instinctively grabbed his wrist to stop him.

But before she could say a word, Matthew screamed.

“Mommy! My hand hurts! She’s hurting me! She’s bullying me! Waaah!”

His wails echoed through the massive villa.

Clarissa winced as her scalp throbbed, tears springing to her eyes from the sting. Her first instinct was to look at Norris. But he wasn’t looking at her, his worried gaze was fixed on Matthew.

She followed his line of sight, and her heart dropped. Matthew’s wrist was bleeding.

Shocked, she sat frozen as Gabrielle scooped the child into her arms, tears streaming down her face as she cradled him.

Clarissa’s mind was still blank when Norris’s voice exploded in fury.

“Clarissa! Matthew is just a kid. What are you doing, picking a fight with him? I already told you Gabrielle is just staying here temporarily. Do you really have to keep holding on to the past? It's just a room. Do you have to be so petty and pick a fight with her over it?”

His blatant favoritism hit Clarissa like a slap to the face, but she forced herself to stay calm.

“Norris—” she began, her voice low.

But he cut her off sharply. “Enough! This is still my house, and it’s not your place to decide who stays where. I gave her that room. Even if you're upset, why did you take it out on a child? I’m really disappointed in you. Think about your actions.”

With that, he stormed out the door, carrying Matthew in his arms like a devoted father. Gabrielle followed close behind.

As she passed Clarissa, Gabrielle threw her a quick smile—small, smug, and unmistakably triumphant.

Only then did she understand everything.

With the red marks from Matthew’s hits still fresh on her face, she watched the three of them together like one happy family. At that moment, she realized she was the outsider.

The tears came uncontrollably then. Her breathing grew ragged, and her chest ached like she couldn’t pull in enough air. She had no idea how long she had cried. At some point, she must have cried herself to sleep.

She was just jolted awake by the ringing of her phone.

She picked it up and heard her aunt’s familiar, gentle voice on the other end.

“Clarissa, the immigration paperwork will be finalized within a week. Are you serious this time? You’re not backing out again, are you? It’s been so long. I miss you.”

Clarissa gave a bitter smile. “I’m serious. I might be bothering you for the rest of my life.”

There was a short pause before her aunt spoke again.

“What about Norris? Are you two… divorced?”

Clarissa let out a quiet, “Mm.Divorced, it's a real divorce."" Clarissa repeated painfully, remembering what Norris said.

Her aunt’s heart ached for her, but she knew comforting words wouldn’t help. So instead, she offered warmth.

“Then start packing. I’ll come to pick you up in a week. Don’t worry about bringing anything. We’ve got everything you need here in the Netherlands.”

“Daryll is still worried about you. He is the Daryll who pursued you when they were little.”

Aunt bit of kindness finally eased the weight in Clarissa’s chest.

After they hung up, she looked around the house. There really wasn’t anything she needed to take with her.

If Gabrielle wanted the room so badly, let her have it.

She could have Norris, too.

That night, Clarissa picked a clean guest room at random, curled up on the bed, and quickly drifted off.

She didn’t know how long she’d slept before a sharp sound of glass shattering startled her awake.

She shot upright and followed the noise, which had come from the master bedroom.

Confused, she wondered what kind of glass item would even be in there. But as she got closer to the door, a sudden chill ran through her. Her instincts screamed that something wasn’t right.

She rushed to the door, pushed it open, and her eyes went wide.

“What the hell are you doing?!”

Chapter 3

Third Person's POV

Glass shards covered the floor. The once-beautiful wedding photo that used to hang on the wall was now shattered and torn beyond repair.

Matthew was stomping on her face in the picture, laughing as he did, spewing crude words that no child his age should even know.

Across the room, Gabrielle turned her head with a smirk, clearly enjoying the scene. Her eyes locked on Clarissa with a mocking glint. She didn’t see her as a threat, barely even as a person.

Then she turned to her son and gave him instructions like she was coaching a performance.

""Matthew, do you want Daddy or not? If you do, then do exactly what Mommy just told you.""

The boy nodded like an obedient little soldier. Then, without a second of hesitation, he picked up a lighter and flicked it on, holding it to a diary clutched in his other hand.

Clarissa's heart seized.

“No! Don’t. Don’t do that!” she shouted, panic surging through her chest.

Frantically, she pushed her wheelchair forward, chasing him down the room. But Matthew thought it was a game. He ran in circles, always just out of reach, laughing like this was all some kind of sick fun.

By the time she finally caught up, the damage was done. The diary had burned to nothing—just a pile of gray ash.

Clarissa’s hands trembled as she picked up the one tiny, half-burnt corner left. Her shoulders shook with sobs she could no longer hold back.

That diary had been the only thing her parents left her. It documented their short lives, their hopes, and their love. It was her only connection to them. For years, in the lonely silence of her life, she'd read it to feel less alone.

When she married Norris, she had brought it with her to this house. She wanted to lock it away, but he told her not to worry.

""As long as I’m here, no one would dare touch it,"" he had said.

But he didn’t keep his word.

Now, not only had someone touched it—they’d destroyed it. And he’d let them walk in and do it.

Clarissa clutched the tiny scrap of paper tightly in her palm. Her voice was raw with fury and heartbreak as she shouted, “Gabrielle! Is this how you raise your son? Teaching him to destroy things that don’t belong to him? Did you ever teach him what basic respect even means?”

For a moment, Gabrielle looked taken aback. Her eyes reddened, and tears welled up.

“Matthew never had a father growing up. I raised him alone. Blame me if you want, but he’s still just a child. You don’t have to be so harsh. I’m sorry, okay? I’ll apologize.”

Clarissa frowned, unsure how to respond, but then she felt a heavy gaze.

She turned and saw Norris standing at the doorway, his expression dark. He strode toward them, face set in a deep scowl.

“Clarissa,” he said, “he’s a child. Why do you keep picking fights with him? Gabrielle even agreed to give you the room back. Isn’t that enough? Do you really have to drive them out to feel satisfied?”

His voice was sharp, edged with frustration.

Clarissa’s heart clenched. She held up the charred piece of the diary with shaking hands, her voice breaking as she tried to explain, “Norris, do you even know what he—”

Before she could finish, he slapped the burnt scrap from her hand.

“It’s just a notebook, Clarissa!” he snapped. “What boy his age isn’t a little wild? Must you make such a big deal out of it? If you want, I’ll buy you a hundred more, a thousand! Will that finally be enough for you?”

She stared at the paper fragment as it fluttered to the ground, only to be stepped on by Gabrielle’s heel.

That was it. Something in her finally gave way.

A hollow laugh escaped her lips, bitter and worn out. She let her body fall back in the wheelchair like all the fight had drained from her.

“Fine,” she said quietly. “You’re right. I’m sorry. It’s my fault.”

For a second, Norris’s expression shifted. Her defeated tone hit him in a place he didn’t expect, and it stung. Seeing despair in her lifeless eyes, he opened his mouth, maybe to apologize, but before he could speak, Matthew cut in.

“Uncle Norris, can I play with this?” the boy asked, holding up a small gift box in his hands.

Norris glanced over, assuming it was just some empty box lying around.

“Sure,” he said. “Go ahead.”

But Clarissa knew exactly what was inside. Her eyes widened in panic, and she quickly shouted, “No! You can’t touch that!”

Third Person's POV

Just when a trace of guilt had begun to creep into Norris’s heart, Clarissa’s voice made him frown again.

“It’s just an old box. Do you have to be so petty, Clarissa? Or is it that you just can’t stand anything he does?”

Clarissa froze. His words hit her like a slap. She stared at him, disbelief washing over her. It hit her then. He truly didn’t remember what was in that box.

Her hand, which had reached out instinctively, lingered midair. She hesitated for a long moment, thinking maybe she should remind him about the ring.

But before she could say anything, Matthew cut in.

“Uncle Norris, I really want this box. Can I throw out what’s inside?”

Already irritated by Clarissa, Norris didn’t even think twice. He just wanted to shut this whole scene down.

“Sure. Toss it if you want.”

Clarissa’s heart sank when she saw Matthew pull out the ring. Her chest tightened, and she instinctively tried to reach for it.

But Matthew was already walking toward the fireplace, just about to toss it in, when he paused. He looked back at his mother.

“Mom, this ring’s kind of pretty. Are you sure we should throw it away?”

Gabrielle’s face stiffened. She didn’t dare look at Norris. Instead, she blinked rapidly, silently urging her son to go through with it.

Norris’s expression shifted slightly when he heard the word “ring.” He turned to look, only to see it fall into the fire.

In a flash, the flames swallowed it.

His gaze snapped to Clarissa. He opened his mouth several times, trying to speak, but the look in her eyes left him hollow. Words stuck in his throat.

Clarissa didn’t look at him. Without a word, she wheeled herself to the fireplace and reached in, trying to retrieve the ring.

The fire had only just started and wasn’t roaring yet, but it was still hot enough to make her flinch and hiss from the pain.

Norris’s heart twisted at the sight. He instinctively stepped forward, ready to pull her back, but Gabrielle got there first.

She hurried over with her son in her arms, gave him a few heavy pats, then turned teary eyes on Clarissa.

“I’m so sorry. This is all my fault. I didn’t teach him better. Please, let me apologize on his behalf. Just tell me how much the ring costs. I’ll save up and buy you a new one.”

Clarissa stared at her blankly, the expression on Gabrielle’s face utterly fake to her.

Not getting a response, Gabrielle glanced at Norris from the corner of her eye and saw his attention still fixed on Clarissa. Her gaze hardened. Then, with a thud, she dropped to her knees.

“It’s all my fault. Please, Clarissa, forgive me. If you’re still mad, then hit me. Go ahead!”

She grabbed Clarissa’s hand and slapped it against her own face. Clarissa tried to pull back, but Gabrielle wouldn’t let go.

A loud smack echoed through the room. Gabrielle’s cheek reddened immediately.

Not satisfied, she let go of Clarissa’s hand and began slapping herself, over and over, crying and apologizing between each blow.

Clarissa frowned at the absurd scene. She opened her mouth to tell her to stop the act, but before she could speak, Norris shoved her away.

Her wheelchair wasn’t locked, so the sudden force sent her sliding backward. The chair slammed into the desk behind her, and she tumbled out, landing hard on the floor.

Norris hadn’t meant to push her that hard. His eyes widened in shock, and he started toward her, but Gabrielle caught his arm first.

He turned to see her swollen, tear-streaked face. Something in him froze. Without saying anything, he pulled her into his arms protectively.

Then he looked down at Clarissa coldly.

“Clarissa, Gabrielle already apologized. Why won’t you let it go? It’s just a ring. Did you really have to humiliate her by trying to fish it out of the fire?”

Clarissa lay awkwardly on the floor, her burned hand pressed against the wooden floorboards. Pain shot through her, leaving her speechless.

Her legs were numb, making it useless. Still, she tried to lift herself multiple times, only to collapse again and again. The helplessness brought tears to her eyes.

Norris hesitated, guilt flickering in his eyes. He took a step forward to help, but Matthew quickly grabbed his hand.

“Uncle Norris, it’s my fault. I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to make her mad.”

His small hand tugged gently, and that was all it took for Norris’s heart to soften. He steeled himself once again against Clarissa.

“If you love making life difficult for others so much,” he said coldly, “then you can pick yourself up off the floor. Let’s see how long you can keep playing the victim.”

Clarissa stared at him as he stepped right on their torn wedding photo, grinding it under his shoe.

It felt like he was stepping on her heart, crushing what little hope she had left.

In that moment, something inside her broke.

She didn’t want to love him anymore.

Not even a little.

Chapter 4

Third Person's POV

Clarissa lay on the floor for what felt like forever before finally managing to crawl back into her wheelchair.

The bedroom, once warm and comforting, was now a complete mess. But Norris didn’t seem to see any of it. All he remembered was her being ""dramatic.""

Clarissa let out a soft laugh, more bitter than amused, like she was mocking herself.

A moment later, she pulled out her phone and dialed her lawyer.

“How much longer will it take?”

Attorney Turner sounded surprised,. “I was just about to call you!

The process is almost done,the marriage relationship will be dissolved tomorrow.”

Clarissa found herself subconsciously picking at her palm. So, five years of marriage end in less than five days.

She swallowed the last trace of hesitation and told him to bring it over tonight.

1l9imrw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Incontinence/comments/1l9imrw/enough_is_enough/,Enough Is Enough,"Hello all, returning after a little hiatus.

I am finally at odds with my bathroom habits and moving forward with a urologist. I for the most part of my life have had incidents with urine control (Dry) whether it’s night or day. 

(TLDR is available!) 

My issue with my habits involve constant anxiety/stress from having to revolve my day around finding a bathroom or losing sleep because I decided to drink liquids from dinner. Some days I strain myself from liquids or I completely drop doing hobby’s/events unless I wear a brief. I do not wear regularly during the day as I feel morally wrong going out without a professionals opinion. Yes it’s stupid but I don’t like making up stories either, I only wear on certain days when I am busy with multiple appointments basically. 

Anyways, today I noted I used the bathroom 11 times from 9 AM -> 4:30 PM. Every time as well, the urge is almost instant no matter how much liquid goes out. In 2 instances I felt like I dribbled and lost control before I unbuckled my belt but fortunately I made it in time. 

Most of my liquid intake was during morning which amounted to 48 oz of water and less than 96oz total by 6PM. No coffee or energy drinks. 

I’m consulting with my doctor to refer me to a urologist about if it’s a underlying condition or an OAB I can continue to treat using the option I chose before going through every other option but doing so I am afraid of letting the urologist know I already went out of my way and went with the option of using diapers before seeking professional help. I know theres options most recommend like exercises & or meds that help or even are easier but I feel most comfortable using briefs which I bet a lot of patients they go through probably loathe the option and would rather use pills. However for me, I’m not comfortable adding more pills if the one way to treat my condition is already something I do that barely affects me day to day. ( I already suffer from fatigue/nausea & or fevers from using PreP)      

It sounds more high-maintenance but wearing diapers is nothing new for me anyways so I figured to go this route, I was a long-term bedwetter using disposables upwards into my high-school days that my guardian’s supplied but never brought up to my doctor. I also suffered insomnia if I didn’t use a brief at the time which seems to have carried over into my adult life now.

Aside from my day-time issues, I experimented journaling & testing my liquid intake from morning to bedtime and found out I slept better regardless of how high or low my intake was. In multiple situations I recorded myself waking up at irregular hours (almost twice a night) & in return causing my work efficiency to be lower the following day, in nights where I wore I’d sleep through the night entirely with no problem & wake up better rested.

TLDR:

Aside from venting my concerns, It’s about time I get professionally diagnosed instead of hiding things from my doctor especially now that I am on my own. My main concern is just what to expect a Urologist will ask or do on a first & recurring visit + what to say or not overshare in my situation. If anyone could let me know your experience in the comments, it’ll be most appreciated! 

I feel morally grey with my decision since I went out of my way already to accommodate disposable products but it was the easiest & most comfortable option for me.

As of right now I am less stressed & efficient at work, sleeping better, being more active outside of work to the fullest. Chosen family & close friends know about what I’m going through but are fully supportive. 

For reference: I am 20 years old with no history in the family for incontinence, I’m not sure if stress from abuse (mental & physical trauma) has any factor with it, I also work in a demanding office job requiring me to be on my feet or in a vehicle constantly away from a bathroom. Another reason for me to not feel comfortable using pills in an event it impairs my driving, Surgery is also another thing I’m not fond of, I’ve already been under the knife multiple times (hernia, cyst, etc). I’d only do it if it means saving my life basically.

I met this very cute girl in the very first week of my university, we talked a bit that day. And one day, just out of no where I asked her why's she so late to class in the middle of class and she told me, I'll tell you later. Later after the class, we went out and talked about life and shii for like 2 hours straight. See, I was 18 back then and never ever talked to a girl for even 5 minutes on my own and it was very special for me because at the end of the conversation I didn't even realize how time passed by. That was the exact day when I fell in love with her(the sparkle in her eyes, her cute smile, her voice, her personality, the way she interpreted everything, above all the way she made me feel that day). I was living a vacuous life before that, but that was the day where everything turned around and I started to feel that my life really made some sense because of her and she might have been the one I have been waiting for so long. I asked for her insta and she told me that she doesn't have one, so, we exchanged numbers and stayed in contact ever since.

She used to ask me for help regarding the university assignments and homeworks and I helped her with everything. Sometimes she used to take hours or even a day to respond, I thought she might be busy and replied in seconds. I helped her a lot more than one could imagine. And then I wished her ""Happy new year"" the upcoming year on 1st Jan and she replied with some religious crap on 8th Jan right before the lecture. I didn't respond as I was completely pissed off and then the next day, she texts again that she won't be writing any exams that sem, I didn't even mark her message as seen as I was already done with it.

The next semester, she texted me at the beginning of the semester asking me why I didn't respond to her, out of kindness, I was like fine, and then I responded and then started to help her with university and stuff whenever she asked me for any help. She also gave me her university credentials to submit her assignments and stuff, I was okay with it as I didn't have anything else to do, I helped her (wasted hours and days to help her). Even then sometimes, she didn't respond like for one or two days and she never apologized for that, we used to have eye contact in the lectures and she didn't even respond. One day, I asked for her insta over chat again, she told me that she has a bf and he would be jealous about that. I WAS TOTALLY DONE, I gave her everything I had, helped her and well, she has a bf. End of the story. I stopped responding her and ghosted her, she used to text me for stuff even then, like why are you not answering? please help me with this assignment and stuff. I didn't have any friends to share and ask this with, I just helped her but I started treating her as she did to me, like responding in days. And she didn't write any exams that semester as well.

After the semester break, in the 3rd winter semester, I became tutor for a subject from 1st sem under the professor. And since she was in the waiting semester(extra time given to students to pass the 1st phase of study to continue their studies), she texted me one day after like 3 months, asking if I was the tutor?  
I came from the gym saw her message and I don't know why I was so happy over again, I even jumped out of excitement, I replied her, BAMMMM, everything changed. This semester she stayed in my contact better than she had ever been, she asked for a shit ton of help, I was like okay, I don't know why but I fell for her this time, actually she really talked to me for the very first time this well. We started to meet at the library and stuff. Like really, after seeing her I would actually forget all the problems of my life and her SMILE, HER SMILE was like a cure to everything I was dealing through. I even brought her chocolates this time, I grabbed my heart and asked her to go to the Christmas market with me together after the library, and some how she agreed. BROO, IT WAS THE VERY FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE WHEN I WENT SOMEWHERE WITH A GIRL, I was totally all over the moon, enjoyed every moment of it, I truly loved it man. It was one of the best experience of my life. Days, passed by, I started to pray for her happiness and also prayed to God that she becomes mine, was romanticizing the journey of love with her in my dreams. This time on 1st Jan, I wrote her a big paragraph wishing her a lot of good things and stuff(my actual way of expressing love), she replied in few minutes. Life was so good man, it was kinda perfect. She used to smile every time I saw her at the university or even at the streets. Semester ended(she still just wrote one exam and skipped the rest because she became sick), I gave my absolute best this time to help her as well, and at the end of the sem, we met once over a coffee in the lib, we were just talking about life and stuff and I also brought her favorite chocolates for her, gave her, she smiled and said thank you but you don't have to. I was all in that time, my friend told me ask for her insta this time in person and also look for a way to meet her in the semester break. I asked her for her insta this time, bro, she told me that she told her bf that she won't give her insta to any guys. The way my smile faded was crazy and noticable. I cried my eyes out that night and ruined my semester break in depression. I was completely broken man, and stood at the edge. My friend told me to block her and I didn't do it, I just ghosted her this time as well.

Next usual semester, she came back texting me, I just didn't respond her for like a month, and used to text me every now and then asking ""Is everything okay? or does it have something to do with me?"" Out of pity, I responded. She was looking for help as usual, asked me to do her exercises again for another subject, and this time it was a bit weird, she told me that she will pay me for it. I was like nah man, I will help you and in return, I just want you to be happy forever. On her bday, I brought her some chocolates this time and gave her at the lib, and told her, if she passes her exams(because this time she has to, if not they will kick her out of the uni) I will buy her something just to motivate her. She told me I will text you about something. Bro after 4 days, she texted me, ""you told me that you will buy me something if I pass the exams. I am engaged now and my fiance will not like it""  
Wowee her bf became her fiance now. I saw the message and didn't care to respond. After a week since the deadline of one of her assignments were reaching, she started texting me again, I ghosted her for a week and she reached out 4 times during this time, my friends told me to block her this time. Out of pity helped her again and wished her luck, I didn't want her to say that she couldn't do something because I didn't help her. And my crazy ass friend, told me since you helped her with everything (actually there's nothing else left to help her with she got everything she could have, from my help), ask her to invite me to her marriage and the message that I sent was ""Congrats, Invite me to your wedding. I would be happy to join a friend's wedding"". IDK if that was a stupid ass move, I sent that message and now I am going insane because she saw it and i didn't get any response yet(it's been 24 hours). She won't text me anymore because all her tasks are done and she will probably change her course because she couldn't cope-up with it. Only question I have is this: Did she ever feel like I loved her throughout? If yes, I lost with pride.

Moral of the story: I was stupid, immature, dumb, naive, and above all the biggest loser of all time.

Now, I think that someone else will the life that I dreamt of with her, someone else will help her in her problems, someone else will take care of her, someone else will make her happy, I was like a page in her book, and she was my entire book. I wanted to be the one to buy her flowers, I wanted to be the one to make her happy man, shii hurts a lot :(

This reminds me of: ""The winner gets it all, and the loser has to fall""

Do I not deserve to be loved by someone man? Am I really that bad? Or, what could I have done better for her?",1,1749722561.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

No matter what it is it always feels like i just don't do as well as i can be doing. All of those things are my passions but i just can't seem to get good at any one of them. I won't say i'm bad, just... It's unsatisfactory to me.

I'm not a very diligent individual. I usually laze around at home doing fuck all, watching funny videos compilations on youtube or doomscrolling on here. It just feels so hard to get out there and do the things i genuinely love doing whether it's from a lack of desire to do literally anything or decision paralysis between things i want to accomplish and staying comfortable.

For example in the case of music people always say to practice at least 5 minutes a day. I can't even get myself to do that. Why? Because doing the latest pokedoku is easier. But then when i jam with my friends, i always feel like i'm playing on guide rails and i just can't get out. And then when one of my friends does some cool solo, knowing i literally can't do that just makes me feel disheartened about everything.

""\[me\] Is a multifaceted individual that must be allowed to apply himself-"" is a thing my 7th grade math teacher actually said about me. But right now it just feels like every one of those facets is at a dead end.

I hope none of this sounds as dumb to anyone as it does to me. It feels like complaining on the internet instead of actually going to do any of those things i mentioned earlier but i felt like if i didn't get it off my chest now i never would have.

for the sake of record keeping, I am 18 and have ADHD, but i don't want to put any blame on it because it's not necessarily the problem.",1,1749722410.0,Vent,2,1.0,False

1l9ihzz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l9ihzz,My recent lippie haul. (2nd pic) My current collection and reviews🍃,"💠Okay! So I’ve finally decided to stop buying more lippies no matter the deals because I don’t want to over-consume more than I already have. I believe this is more than enough to last me for years. Of course, this doesn’t include lip care products🌝 If you want swatches, ask me. I don’t have enough space for them on my hand. I’ll provide whenever asked in the comments section🥰

💠 **LIPPIE REVIEWS**💠 It’s going to be long!

🔅 **Diam Beauty Love Potion Lip Oil** (shade: Funfetti): The packaging is so pretty! It has a mild chocolate-ish mousse scent, slightly sweet. The applicator could be better. I found it weirdly bulky. When I first applied it, I was sure it’d lay thick on my lips but surprisingly it was pretty lightweight and slightly sticky but nothing uncomfortable. It doesn’t dry out my lips, so, the hydration is pretty good! Not transfer-proof of course, but holy moly it lasted my whole gym and swimming session! I did not expect that. Even after all my swimming, my lips still looked glossy and the lip oil stayed! You can easily wipe it off, but unless you do it, IT STAYS. Even after wiping it off, my lips felt moisturized and plump. So, will I be purchasing it again? Probably! (Note: I didn’t eat anything in the gym, just electrolyte water. I didn’t test it with edibles yet.)

🔅 **Diam Beauty Glass Tint Balm** (shade: Peach Moonstone): This one smells similar to the lip oil but slightly more on the sweeter side. Yes, the balm melts even on a slight change in temperature. I’m surprised it didn’t melt inside the container. Not very pleasant to use simply because whenever I try to glide the balm across the lips, it breaks + melts. The tint is pretty but again, not transfer-proof. Staying power isn’t much but then again it’s a balm so I didn’t expect much. Will I purchase it again? Not likely.

🔅 **Staze 9to9 Love Tri-Angle** (shade: 03 Caramel Rose): The Instagram ads got me. Bought this around mid-2024 and surprisingly I’ve used it quite a bit. Firstly, it has a very distinct wax smell. I don’t know if I like it or not. I really love the color payoff. It’s not transfer-proof unlike their paid ads. Not hydrating at all. I have always moisturized my lips, so, it didn’t dry out my lips much; otherwise, it’ll definitely dry you out and leave dry patches. Staying power isn’t much. Honestly, I used it only because of its color payoff. Otherwise, it feels like one of those old lipsticks of old times with no staying power. It does have a blurring effect though. Will I purchase it? Nope. Just your basic lipstick formula that you can whip up on your own as well, considering you’ve got the required materials and ingredients.

🔅 **Staze 9to9 Crème De La Matte** (shade: 04 Tequila Sunrise and 05 Strawberry Daiquiri): These ones have a slightly better fragrance. Very similar formula with a better blurring effect. Rest is still the same. Haven’t improved much. Hydrates a teensy bit. Not much. Tequila Sunrise is your classic red shade, it’s pretty but nothing much. There are plenty of red lipsticks out there which offer much more. The shade Strawberry Daiquiri is definitely one of the prettiest pink shades I’ve used. It compliments me too well! I have been looking for its color dupe in better brands🥹 Might repurchase only for this shade 🥲

🔅 **Maybelline SuperStay Vinyl Ink** (shade: 160 Sultry and 170 Unafraid): I think there are a lot of reviews of this already. I won’t be adding anything new ig. I really love its smell. It’s almost like a dessert. Like the name, IT STAYS! It stayed throughout the day. Through my multiple coffees and Redbulls (ik caffeine addict accusations incoming) and also heavy lunch, something like biryani👀. Right after application it is slightly sticky and you’ll have to let it set for a few seconds. After that, it’ll stay for at least 10 hrs. I’ve tried this multiple times and have been using it since December 2024. Will I repurchase it? Yes, definitely. It’s like a love-hate relationship 😩

🔅 **Etude** 🔅

💠 **Fixing Matte Tint** (shade: 07 Cranberry Plum and 05 Midnight Mauve): I love it so much! It smells mildly sweet. The texture is so airy. It literally feels like nothing on your lips. It is not 100% transfer-proof but doesn’t transfer that easily either. It transfers a very diluted tint upon contact with anything liquid. The tint payoff is amazing. It has a really good blurring effect. It doesn’t dry out your lips but it’s not exactly hydrating as well. I’ve already repurchased it🤭

💠 **Fixing Glow Tint** (shade: 05 Mauvement): Love the glassy container. It’s super cute. This is my second purchase in the same shade. It used to be called glass tints before. It has a really light spirit-ish smell, it’s almost not noticeable unless you inhale the tints (🌝why’d you do that?). Very airy and light on lips. The tint is extremely light but distinct. It gives soft and glowy lips without heavy pigmentation. Perfect for everyday and no-makeup makeup looks. It is hydrating as well.

💠 **Over Glowy Tint** (shade: 03 Ddori Apple Red): It really feels very similar to Glow Tints. This is also almost fragrance-free but not really. The only difference I felt was Glowy Tint feels water-based and Glow Tints are oil-based. But I could be wrong. Love the formula. Feels like nothing on lips. Again, very light tint payoff. It’s like your lips but slightly better. Would I buy it again? Probably not, because like I already mentioned it feels very similar to Glow Tints. No point in overconsumption.

💠 **Dear Darling Water Gel Tint Lipstick** (shade: PK002): I really didn’t like the smell of this one. The tint is heavily pigmented and it doesn’t wipe off easily. It took me a while to figure out how to use it without making my lips look patchy. I’ve hydrated lips but it still manages to cling only to a few dry spots. The staying power is really good. I used it mostly as blush on my cheeks. Will I buy it again? Nope. I just didn’t enjoy how it clings to only a few spots on my lips. To use this properly on lips I have to go through 2–3 steps. Not really ideal.

🔅 **Rom&nd Zero Matte Lipstick** (shade: 15 Midnight): It is fragrance-free, almost. It has a very, very subtle chemical smell. I’ve an extremely sensitive nose, so, nothing is truly smell-free to me (๑˃̵🐽˂̵) The texture is very creamy but on application, it’s very light and you won’t feel like anything is sitting on your lips. Color payoff is really good! Not transfer-proof. I found its staying power very conditional. Sometimes it stays even after a heavy meal like a burger, fries, and beverage. At times it won’t even last after one samosa. It’s not hydrating but doesn’t dry out your lips either. Would I repurchase? Probably not. Because now I’ve found lipsticks/lip tints that offer better payoff for the similar price.

🔅 **Tirtir Watersism Glow Tint** (shade: 30 Mauve Blush): I bought the mini one. The packaging is so cute! I love it so much! I bought it because there was so much hype on Reddit about it and honestly, rightfully so! The formula is so light and airy. It feels similar to Etude Glow Tints but slightly more watery. But the pigmentation! Gosh! It’s so pretty! And the staying power! I’d say it definitely rivals Maybelline Super Stay ones. It’s by far the best water tint I’ve tried so far. It’s hydrating, pigmented, glossy, and so affordable! I bought the mini one. But why is no one talking about how weird it smells😭 I don’t hate it but definitely dislike it. Repurchase it? Most likely not. As I’ve mentioned earlier, I have an extremely sensitive nose. While the smell isn’t particularly strong, due to my sensitivity I cannot get past it. But if you don’t mind it, it’s probably the best water tint in the market right now.

1l9igru,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/1l9igru/rant_exposing_my_roommates_from_hell/,[RANT] Exposing my Roommates from HELL,"Throwaway because holy shit.

I have been living with these fuckers for two years now and we’re finally moving out after graduation. It has been a wild ride and I want to make this post as a warning to future roommates at whatever city or grad school or whatever they end up at.

First of all, we picked the WORST most NOTORIOUS housing in University City. The leasing agency is extremely unhelpful with anything and outsources every single micron of service to a third party contractor. Every day the smoke alarms go off and the laundry machines are all taken or broken. I almost got caught in a shootout just moving in. If you know, you know this place. Might expose the name in the replies if people are interested but that’s beyond the topic of this post.

What ever you do, NEVER EVER room with CS majors. They are a different breed. They wear the same 3 free hackathon t-shirts every day. They’re always up late working on their latest PA (or worse, playing TF2). AND they’re always coming home late with free food from some event that they won’t even share with you.

But that’s not even the worst of it.

These MFers in particular are BAT SHIT INSANE. All of our furniture is unethically sourced; ie. they got almost everything for free from people they no longer talk to OR straight from the DUMPSTER!! And it’s literally all falling apart. The couches are quite literally tearing at the seams. It’s like roulette trying to sit at the kitchen table because half of the chairs have broken bottoms and you just fall through.

They will just leave their stuff all over like it’s a yard sale. Once someone left their SOCK on the TABLE where we fuckin EAT! Another time, someone left an onion in the cabinet for weeks and we never noticed until it was too late. We were getting a fruit fly infestation and couldn’t find the source until the onion had completely changed color and was leaking brown juice everywhere. Even after I cleaned it up, the flies remained for the rest of the quarter and we had to run around with the vacuum sucking them up off the ceiling!!?

And on the topic of the kitchen, it’s consistently a whole mess. They keep inviting a weirdo over to cook extra extravagant dishes such as beef bourgenion that take forever to make super late at night. Sure they’ll share it, but the gremlin always leaves without cleaning up after itself! I always know it’s been here since it leaves cans of Sapporo | #1 Premium Japanese Lager everywhere alongside the dishes piled in the sink. There’s another one that’s notorious for poking holes in ceilings and literally took apart our smoke alarm without us even asking, but I don’t even have the space to get into that whole mess.

Don’t even get me started with the bathrooms. We have so much black mold growing everywhere that it’s created a permanent stench that burns the nostrils of all our visitors. You can also tell when it’s the uterus users’ times of the month cause the whole unit smells like dog surgery. Plus one of my roommates dumped coffee grounds down the drain one time, permanently clogging it forever.

Aside from their lack of general cleanliness, their taste in decor is DISGUSTING. The most tasteful thing we have is our foldable paper bus and train collection on the mantlepiece, so I'll give them that. They literally take any sticker or flier from any event and stick it to one section of our wall, resulting in a mass of built up layers of random UCSD advertising. You know those Ditto AI fliers that were going around last quarter? They collected every single edition of them. It’s a fucking transit-ditty museum up in here.

We also have pride flags plastered EVERYWHERE. Like I’m not gonna be phobic in the month of pride #BeWhoYouAre but like, maybe tone it down just a notch??? EVERY FUCKING WEDNESDAY they pregame way too hard to go off to welfare so they can be gay or whatever (again-no shade-I love my lgbtq’s #ForYourPride) and come back COMPLETELY WASTED and complain about the hangover and their classes the next day. Like imagine going to Rich's to listen to darude sandstorm with 80% straight guys cause you're scared of the gogo dancer boys and $5 well drinks at flicks. Or maybe if you went to NOVA (to see quality artists such as wooli) on the weekend like the rest of us, we wouldn’t be in this predicament would we?

And they'll literally sublet to random strangers. Like okay at least run that by me first WTF? We had a study abroad student subletting last quarter and they accidentally deleted #general in our apartment's discord server!?? Like thousands of historical conversations just erased like THAT.

The worst of it all has to be the “parties” they throw (I wouldn’t even call them kickbacks). All they do is drink and be super loud, and I always find someone sleeping on our nasty ass couches. One time, they were singing Hatsune Miku karaoke and the following day we got a noise complaint from our landlord. Like holy shit?? I’m not trying to get fucking kicked out of our complex!! They’re also “cinephile” types too. Always watching whatever letterbox recommends them SUPER late at night on their shitbox projector. Sometimes they’ll even cuddle on the couch AS FRIENDS!!? Like WTF save that for your significant other or future spouse you fucking polyamorous pagans.

The most ridiculous activity these animals find entertaining is something they call “high effort trolling.” Once they’re completely schmacked at a function, they whip out one of their alternate identities’ social media accounts and start posting shit, including on Reddit. There’s a super popular shitposter on this subreddit ran by the conglomerate that I will not name. Who the hell even finds this stuff entertaining?!?

Future Mate,

I’m a guy in my late 20s looking to build a solid, long-term friendship with someone who’s also keen on something deeper than just surface-level chat or the occasional pub catch-up.

Not after a quick mate for drinks and footy once every few months, although they would be nice. I’m talking real connections. Someone to hang out with regularly online or offline, talk life, unwind, get into some good banter, and actually show up as a mate.

I’ve got a good life and all the usual responsibilities, but something’s missing... a mate who’s down for road trips, late-night chats, dogs at the park, maybe even some “life unpacking” over coffee or a fire pit.

What I’m not after: fake energy, flakey chats, judgement or drugs.

What I am after: consistency, laughs, honesty, emotions, vulnerability, and depth.

Comment below and I will reach out, or feel free to message me directly.

I'd love to share some selfies, talk about deal breakers first up to avoid wasting each other's time and fast tracking if we have the potential to connect even.

Cheers,

1l9ie5p,https://i.redd.it/bgzc7o8ywg6f1.jpeg,AIO? The bathroom on the main floor of my house has turned into my dad’s bathroom - I am disgusted and appalled at its condition.,"I am 23F and living at home while I complete my degrees. I’m only living with my dad (53F) for another year or so. I live here rent free, which is why I didn’t push the idea that my dad actually sleep in her bed at night and not in the living room. I asked her a few times when we first moved in (we moved about a year and a half ago) if she could please not let the main floor turn into her bedroom. I ceased asking after she said she would sleep in her bed multiple times, but ultimately ended up falling asleep in front of the TV every time anyway. At our old house her TV was in her bedroom, but here it’s in the living room. I’m guessing that’s why she sleeps down there. 

Through doing this, she has ruined the couch. The bottom cushions are literally a different colour from the top and smell disgusting because she sweats there every night. We inherited that couch from my grandma, my dad’s mother. 

She leaves her stuff downstairs. I’ll walk downstairs to see her teeth (she wears dentures) sitting on the kitchen counter, or her wig on the little railing down to the bathroom, or her bra on the coffee table. 

These things I’ve learned to live with though. I just take her shit and put it to her bedroom. She doesn’t seem to mind. But I draw the line at the bathroom. If this were her bathroom in her bedroom (she has an ensuite), then that’s her business. But this is the bathroom intended for guests to use when they come over. I’ve resorted to telling people to go upstairs and use mine. 

Yes, that is shit on the floor and the seat. I don’t know how it can be in that condition and she can continue to use it. What do I even do at this point? Do I confront her? 

My mom (53F) (they are divorced but still friends) went to use the bathroom last time she was here and walked out and said “(my dad’s name), that is disgusting. You gotta clean that washroom.” And my dad said “that wasn’t me”. 

UHM. WHO WAS IT THEN? I don’t use that bathroom. Nobody else does. So I think she was just embarrassed. 

I thought that might get her to clean it. It’s been a week since then, and it still looks like this. 

My dad is not a clean person. Never has been. Likes to say she is, but definitely is not. I’ve resorted to making little jokes about how I pay rent by cleaning. Because seriously, I clean up after her every single day. I like a clean house. And you know what, I’m fine with cleaning up after her. But I will NOT clean up her literal shit off the FLOORS. 

I can’t really talk to her directly about this unless I want to deal with a very overdramatic reaction. She gets offended very easily. 

How do I get her to just use her damn bedroom so she doesn’t make the main floor bathroom so disgusting? Or do I bite the bullet and move out before I’m done university? Or do I just live with this for the next 10 months until I’m done? Or am I just completely overreacting and nothing needs to be done? ",2,1749721706.0,AmIOverreacting,10,0.75,False

I met this very cute girl in the very first week of my university, we talked a bit that day. And one day, just out of no where I asked her why's she so late to class in the middle of class and she told me, I'll tell you later. Later after the class, we went out and talked about life and shii for like 2 hours straight. See, I was 18 back then and never ever talked to a girl for even 5 minutes on my own and it was very special for me because at the end of the conversation I didn't even realize how time passed by. That was the exact day when I fell in love with her(the sparkle in her eyes, her cute smile, her voice, her personality, the way she interpreted everything, above all the way she made me feel that day). I was living a vacuous life before that, but that was the day where everything turned around and I started to feel that my life really made some sense because of her and she might have been the one I have been waiting for so long. I asked for her insta and she told me that she doesn't have one, so, we exchanged numbers and stayed in contact ever since.

She used to ask me for help regarding the university assignments and homeworks and I helped her with everything. Sometimes she used to take hours or even a day to respond, I thought she might be busy and replied in seconds. I helped her a lot more than one could imagine. And then I wished her ""Happy new year"" the upcoming year on 1st Jan and she replied with some religious crap on 8th Jan right before the lecture. I didn't respond as I was completely pissed off and then the next day, she texts again that she won't be writing any exams that sem, I didn't even mark her message as seen as I was already done with it.

The next semester, she texted me at the beginning of the semester asking me why I didn't respond to her, out of kindness, I was like fine, and then I responded and then started to help her with university and stuff whenever she asked me for any help. She also gave me her university credentials to submit her assignments and stuff, I was okay with it as I didn't have anything else to do, I helped her (wasted hours and days to help her). Even then sometimes, she didn't respond like for one or two days and she never apologized for that, we used to have eye contact in the lectures and she didn't even respond. One day, I asked for her insta over chat again, she told me that she has a bf and he would be jealous about that. I WAS TOTALLY DONE, I gave her everything I had, helped her and well, she has a bf. End of the story. I stopped responding her and ghosted her, she used to text me for stuff even then, like why are you not answering? please help me with this assignment and stuff. I didn't have any friends to share and ask this with, I just helped her but I started treating her as she did to me, like responding in days. And she didn't write any exams that semester as well.

After the semester break, in the 3rd winter semester, I became tutor for a subject from 1st sem under the professor. And since she was in the waiting semester(extra time given to students to pass the 1st phase of study to continue their studies), she texted me one day after like 3 months, asking if I was the tutor?  
I came from the gym saw her message and I don't know why I was so happy over again, I even jumped out of excitement, I replied her, BAMMMM, everything changed. This semester she stayed in my contact better than she had ever been, she asked for a shit ton of help, I was like okay, I don't know why but I fell for her this time, actually she really talked to me for the very first time this well. We started to meet at the library and stuff. Like really, after seeing her I would actually forget all the problems of my life and her SMILE, HER SMILE was like a cure to everything I was dealing through. I even brought her chocolates this time, I grabbed my heart and asked her to go to the Christmas market with me together after the library, and some how she agreed. BROO, IT WAS THE VERY FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE WHEN I WENT SOMEWHERE WITH A GIRL, I was totally all over the moon, enjoyed every moment of it, I truly loved it man. It was one of the best experience of my life. Days, passed by, I started to pray for her happiness and also prayed to God that she becomes mine, was romanticizing the journey of love with her in my dreams. This time on 1st Jan, I wrote her a big paragraph wishing her a lot of good things and stuff(my actual way of expressing love), she replied in few minutes. Life was so good man, it was kinda perfect. She used to smile every time I saw her at the university or even at the streets. Semester ended(she still just wrote one exam and skipped the rest because she became sick), I gave my absolute best this time to help her as well, and at the end of the sem, we met once over a coffee in the lib, we were just talking about life and stuff and I also brought her favorite chocolates for her, gave her, she smiled and said thank you but you don't have to. I was all in that time, my friend told me ask for her insta this time in person and also look for a way to meet her in the semester break. I asked her for her insta this time, bro, she told me that she told her bf that she won't give her insta to any guys. The way my smile faded was crazy and noticable. I cried my eyes out that night and ruined my semester break in depression. I was completely broken man, and stood at the edge. My friend told me to block her and I didn't do it, I just ghosted her this time as well.

Next usual semester, she came back texting me, I just didn't respond her for like a month, and used to text me every now and then asking ""Is everything okay? or does it have something to do with me?"" Out of pity, I responded. She was looking for help as usual, asked me to do her exercises again for another subject, and this time it was a bit weird, she told me that she will pay me for it. I was like nah man, I will help you and in return, I just want you to be happy forever. On her bday, I brought her some chocolates this time and gave her at the lib, and told her, if she passes her exams(because this time she has to, if not they will kick her out of the uni) I will buy her something just to motivate her. She told me I will text you about something. Bro after 4 days, she texted me, ""you told me that you will buy me something if I pass the exams. I am engaged now and my fiance will not like it""  
Wowee her bf became her fiance now. I saw the message and didn't care to respond. After a week since the deadline of one of her assignments were reaching, she started texting me again, I ghosted her for a week and she reached out 4 times during this time, my friends told me to block her this time. Out of pity helped her again and wished her luck, I didn't want her to say that she couldn't do something because I didn't help her. And my crazy ass friend, told me since you helped her with everything (actually there's nothing else left to help her with she got everything she could have, from my help), ask her to invite me to her marriage and the message that I sent was ""Congrats, Invite me to your wedding. I would be happy to join a friend's wedding"". IDK if that was a stupid ass move, I sent that message and now I am going insane because she saw it and i didn't get any response yet(it's been 24 hours).  She won't text me anymore because all her tasks are done and she will probably change her course because she couldn't cope-up with it. Only question I have is this: Did she ever feel like I loved her throughout? If yes, I lost with pride.

Moral of the story: I was stupid, immature, dumb, naive, and above all the biggest loser of all time.

Now, I think that someone else will the life that I dreamt of with her, someone else will help her in her problems, someone else will take care of her, someone else will make her happy, I was like a page in her book, and she was my entire book. I wanted to be the one to buy her flowers, I wanted to be the one to make her happy man, shii hurts a lot :(

This reminds me of: ""The winner gets it all, and the loser has to fall""

Do I not deserve to be loved by someone man? Am I really that bad? Or, what could I have done better for her?",1,1749721161.0,Pain,0,1.0,False

Zed Glawe-Strom



Lacey Keene stared out the broken window of her mother's Volvo, the Iowa cornfields swaying under a cruel northern wind. The sky was the gray of dead ashes, flat and low. It smelled of snow, though the calendar still withheld the month of October. Welcome to Hollow Oaks. Population: too little to matter.

The town looked like a memory someone had tried to repress. A water tower loomed like a single tooth over rooftops and empty streets. Hollow Oaks. The name itself was eerie. Her mom said it was quaint. Her mom said a lot of things.

They passed the sign for Hollow Oaks, rusted and BB-shot. Somebody had spray-painted below the name: ""LEAVE"" in red. Nothing else. No reason. Just a word. Nobody ever washed it off.

Main Street had one movie theater whose marquee read: NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 3. The theater's ancient bulb lights buzzed like flies. Gator's Arcade next to it throbbed like a dying lung, machines blinking behind dirty windows. Teenagers lingered outside the arcade in jean jackets and unlaced high tops, smoking cigarettes they weren't yet old enough to buy yet knew how to smoke.

They passed in front of the grocery store, pool, diner, police station, and down to the house Lacey now had to call home. It was a one-story ranch with siding the color of rot and a pine tree out front that leaned like it was trying to fall. The wind blew through it and sounded like breathing. Her mother sighed as she switched off the engine. ""It's not permanent. Just until we get ourselves sorted out."" Lacey said nothing. Not because she wasn't curious, but because she didn't believe she was telling the truth. That's what loss did. Made everything new feel like a lie. Her brother died in a quarry back in Rochester, and now here she was in a town where trees whispered and every corner smelled of old wood and something left too long in the dark.

She unpacked silently, walking past cardboard boxes holding a life she didn't want anymore. Her bedroom had one window that faced a sliver of woods. The pine woods beyond appeared darker than they should be, as if they absorbed light. Her first night in Hollow Oaks was devoid of dreams but not emptiness. She woke up three times for no reason. The next day, her first day at a new school, it was a funeral with vending machines.

Lacey stalked the halls of Hollow Oaks High in a Ramones tee and secondhand army jacket, her boots clattering on the tile. She did not try to fit in. That would have been the same as pretending her brother was not dead. The counselors were all telling her what a ""strong"" person she was, which was code for them not knowing what to say.

She met Rick Abrams that day. He was the kind of burnout you didn't go near unless you had something that you needed broken or fixed violently. He had a face that looked like it had been hit and had hit twice as many. Still, there was a kindness in him, far below the reek of ashtray and scowl. When he saw her sitting alone under the bleachers at lunch, he sat down beside her like he had always been there.

""You're the new girl,"" he said, firing up a Marlboro with the kind of boredom that could only be born of familiarity with pain.

""You're the town welcoming committee?""

He smirked. ""Depends. You into weird shit?""

She looked at him. Something in his tone wasn't joking.

""Define weird.""

""Woods out past the mill. People say it eats things. Not like teeth and stomach, more like, you go in wrong, you don't come out right.""

She did not laugh. She did not blink. She merely said, ""Show me.""

The rest of the day was as mindless as the beginning, as much as she had been worried about fitting in, she didn’t try and that had worked. In the halls she hadn’t made enough eye contact to see the weird looks or hear the snickers. What she had noticed, however and it had made her do a double-take was a flyer on a bulletin board on the way out of school, but out of one of the side doors, like it was hidden. It was in orange and said “Looking to Get Away?” in bold letters at the top. She paused to look at it and saw it was a recruitment flyer for a camp counselor. “Camp Hollower, Holoooooow” underneath it simply said furnishings provided, inquire at (563) 867-5309 fulfills Humanities 307 and History 348. Lacey tore a slip off and mumbled under her breath, “You had me get away”.

Along her 1.5-mile journey home, she tried to memorize different landmarks while listening to *Halfway to Sanity*. The town was small enough and her mom had dropped her off that morning so she figured she could find this new shitbox that would be her home. As she was beginning to turn the corner onto 24th street where her “temporary” home lay, she began to hear it, “I lost my mind” not being repeated too much. “I lost my min- I lost my mi- I lost my mind- I lost my- I lost my- I lost my- I LOST MY MIND”. Lacey jumped and flung the headphones off looking around as if someone had done this to her. She felt her breath start to get heavy and her heart to speed up as the wind picked up. “The fuck” Lacey said looking down at her headphones. She gingerly picked them up, no sound. The wind out by Pike Road had teeth. Lacey drew her hoodie tighter and tucked her chin as she trudged along the gravel shoulder, her Keds scuffing up little clouds of dust and shattered leaves. Ahead, the forest arched over the road like a closing jaw, black pines creaking in the wind, whispering to each other in tongues too old for daylight. Behind her, the school bus groaned and wheezed into the turn by Milner’s Feed Lot and vanished with a belch of smoke. She was alone now, as she usually was. Her cassette player crackled in her coat pocket, but the batteries were dying. The sky overhead was turning the color of wet ash. Cold seeped into her sleeves, and somewhere in the distance, a dog was barking in that frantic, confused way that meant it had seen something it didn’t understand. She glanced once at the forest. And then again. There was something there. She was sure of it. Not a shape. Not a sound. Not anything you could see or hear or name. But the way the trees were angled, wrong somehow, bent like they were leaning to listen, and the air, just past the treeline, was... thin. Stretched, almost. Like something huge had just passed by and left a vacuum in its wake. Her stomach turned, low and sharp. She didn’t believe in ghosts. Not really. But she believed in her brother. Had seen him. Once. In the frozen window of the corner store last March. He was dead, she knew that. Had been for almost two years. But in that glass, across rows of boxed cereal and expired milk cartons, she saw the back of his head. The same curl at the nape of his neck. The way he leaned, a little left, like his hip was hurt. When she turned, he was gone. But the milk on the shelf was frozen solid. The clerk didn’t have an explanation. 

The next day, Lacey got dropped off by her mom and waited for her to leave, then a rusty old pickup pulled up. Rick.

They took Rick's truck past the edge of town. Hollow Oaks fell away like a mask ripped from an antique thing. The road turned to gravel. Then dirt. Then nothing.

The woods were a wall of pine, upright and still. The wind didn't blow here. Not in the same manner. It circled like a breath held. The trees didn't move. Not precisely. But they waited.

Rick turned off the engine. No radio. No birds. Only that held breath and the sensation that something old was waiting.

Lacey went first, crunching dead needles underfoot. Her skin felt as though it was tightening, as though the air was nipping. Her brother had always told her that the woods were ideal for hidden doors.

""This place ain't right,"" Rick said behind her, a weird hint of desperation in his voice. 

She nodded. Trying to hide the fear. She didn’t have many shots at making friends here, this felt off, but she had to nail this.

The wind picked up, whispering in a voice that knew her name but couldn't quite pronounce it.

She turned to Rick. He was smaller, as if the forest was preying on him, and he knew it. Was the truck farther away? How far had she walked into the woods?

Something moved in the trees.

Not a form. Not light. Just. Wrongness. Like when you look at something for too long and it doesn't make sense anymore.

Lacey didn't run. She simply turned and said, ""Let's go. NOW.”. They didn’t speak the ride home. Rick offered to take them to the burger joint and Lacey agreed more out of habit than anything. She wasn’t hungry but she knew she should she eat. Rick pulled into a spot and as Lacey went to open the door, as a voice blared out, “Welcome to Sonic! What can I get you?” “Jesus fuck!” Lacey yelled, feeling herself beginning to get some of the emotion out. Rick’s tension seemed to subside a bit as a hint of a smile came across his face. He had jumped at her response but had leaned into it. “Well, not that,” he said, “We’ll do two Super Sonics, Number 2, two fries, two pink lemonades, and one chocolate sundae and one strawberry sundae.”. We waited quietly as the fear began to melt away and the dark began to creep in. Lacey looked out at another car that seemed to have too many people in it all ordering at once. While the invisible voice in the box was having a hard time it did look like they were having fun. One girl caught her eye and she quickly looked away, pretending to be in conversation with Ricky before realizing where she was. She paused. How big of a deal was it that she was being seen in Ricky’s truck? “Are people gonna think I’m fucking Ricky?” She slowly turned her head back around, and saw that girl had gone back to ordering. “Being new had its advantages, I suppose,” she thought. After the food came and they ate, Lacey asked to go home. As they pulled into Lacey’s nondescript home, Ricky couldn’t help but think, “Huh, who the hell is this girl?”. 

That night, Lacey called the number from the flyer, “Hello? Uh, I would love to be a counselor here, I have a ton of experience with children and I really think I can he-” “You’re hired”. Click. 



Camp Hollowers was a thirty-mile drive from Hollow Oaks, established against a black lake that steamed like soup every morning, yet connected to the wooded natural preserve of Hollow Oaks. It was a fall-only camp for grades five through eight, designed to give children one last autumn memory before snow swept in. Cabins protruded along the tree line, and canoes lined the dock like crooked teeth.

Some claimed the lake and the woods across it to be haunted.

Not formally, of course. However, all the counselors were familiar with the legend, or at least some parts of it. And some of the kids, the ones who didn't live at Hollow Oaks, dared each other to canoe out on the lake after dark. A few had even gone into the woods on the other side. None of them stayed long.

The older counselors had a tradition. They called it the Black Paddle. Two or three of them would paddle across the lake once every year, on the night of the All Hollowers Eve Festival, with nothing but a flashlight and a dare. It wasn't allowed, and it wasn't smart. But it was tradition.

Lacey’s mom wouldn’t give her a ride, but Ricky would. She hated relying on other people and didn’t like to call in favors but it was this or more High School. So she chose him. They arrived with the others: Heather, with her sarcasm and smudged eyeliner; Marcus, the quiet stoner who knew more than he said; Phoebei, the punk girl with thunder in her veins; and Caleb, with his football build and a jelly heart. As Lacey stepped out and grabbed her military surplus bag out of the back to say thank you Caleb rushed and picked Ricky up in a bear hug, lifting him off his feet. “You motherfucker, it’s good to see you Rick.”. Lacey looked around, apparently the only one caught off guard. They all put their bags away and as Lacey turned to leave, Phoebe casually said, “Soooo, Ricky?? Lacey? No shame! No judgement! Just a big swing.”. Before Lacey could respond Heather jumped in “Leave it alone Phoebe, wait, weren’t you fucking that one dad last week?”. “And proud of it.”, Phoebe moved closer to Lacey and grabbed her hands, “Shit, I come off strong, just be careful okay? He’s a fine guy but he’s still him you know?”. Lacey nodded. 

They sat at the dock, mist curling off the lake. Trees on the other side were too still.

""So who's paddling out this year?"" Phoebe asked, her voice too casual.

Heather rolled her eyes. ""We've got two weeks until the festival. Can't we pretend to be normal until then?""

Marcus looked at Lacey. ""You saw the woods, didn't you?""

She didn't inquire as to how he knew. ""Yeah.""

""Did it look back?""

She didn't answer.

They sat by the lodge fire pit later that night. Kids roasted marshmallows and told ghost stories. But the counselors sat apart, where the shadows stretched out.

Marcus leaned in. ""My cousin came to this camp three years ago. Said he heard a whispering in the trees on the other side of the lake. Said it knew his name. He's never been the same since.""

Rick nodded. ""It doesn't like to be ignored.""

Maybe we shouldn't go this year,"" Caleb muttered.

Phoebe snorted. ""Afraid?""

He shrugged. ""Wouldn't be the dumbest thing to be afraid of.""

The fire crackled. Steam rose out on the lake.

And in the woods on the far side of the lake, something stirred.

It wasn't a sound. It was a feeling.

""Do you ever get the feeling this place is trying to pretend it's alive?"" Rick asked

Lacey sipped her drink. ""Like a wax figure smiling too big.”

Laughter rang out across the docks.

Marcus and Lacey jumped up to check, the others reacted with confusion “What the fuck man?” Ricky said as he leapt back and spilled his drink. “You… y’all didn’t hear that?” Marcus said, slipping back into his native southern accent he had tried and failed to hide. 

As Marcus looked at Lacey expectantly, the wind picked up and dimmed the fire.



The sun, late in October, dipped below the towering pines and cast long shadows across Camp Hollowers. The camp was along a lake that steamed quietly in the cool air, its surface was black glass that mirrored the dark woods beyond. The wind was now sharp enough to cut through jackets and redden cheeks. Inside the main lodge, the counselors had all gathered around a weathered table, the acrid fumes of burned coffee hanging in the air, mixing with the scented pine musk from outside. Lacey sat next to Heather, who nursed a half-empty can of beer, her usual sarcastic smile dissolved for the time being. Heather flicked ash off her cigarette and looked at him with a kind of weary amusement. ""So, Lacey,"" she said quietly, ""you really believe you're ready for this place? Hollow Oaks isn't necessarily a vacation spot."". Lacey shrugged, the gravity of the question more real than she cared to acknowledge. ""I don't really have a choice, do I?"". Heather nodded slowly. ""Fair enough. Everyone around here's got reasons for sticking around. Some more… complicated than others."". Marcus, sitting back in his chair with a book perched on his knees, looked up. His dark eyes, normally soft and unfocused, were still when he spoke. ""I stayed because it's home. Even if it's the sort of place that you wish to escape from every day. The woods just keep drawing me back."". Phoebe, punk chick with the safety pins and stormy eyes, laughed but without real bite. ""Home can be a prison."" The room went silent once more as Caleb, big and quiet, finally spoke. His voice was low and guarded. ""Sometimes it feels like the woods want to swallow you whole. I've heard things out there, things no one should hear.""



Lacey gazed around the table, candlelight dancing in shadows on their faces. All of them had their own scars, worn like badges or hidden like secrets. For a moment, they weren't camp counselors, they were survivors, tormented in their own ways. ""I think the woods are waiting,"" she said softly. ""For something. Or someone."" 

Rick, who'd been quiet until now, finally spoke. His voice was rough, his words tinged with the weariness of too many late nights and too many things it would be better not to say. ""They don't just wait. They remember. They take. They want."" Heather snorted with bitter laughter. ""Great. Now it's a horror movie cliché."" No one laughed from then on.



Backstory: Heather 

Heather's rough demeanor was no act. She was raised in a dysfunctional home, learning from an early age that sarcasm and attitude were the best protection. She didn't easily trust, but the camp was her sanctuary of sorts—a place to catch her breath without fear. Beneath all the cynicism, she yearned for connection, though she didn't know how to say it.

Backstory: Marcus

Marcus's quiet nature concealed a restless mind. Grown up by a couple of hippie parents, he had spent his youth exploring the woods surrounding Hollow Oaks, devouring everything from Lovecraft to Stephen King. His interest in the supernatural was academic only in theory, personal in reality. Something in the woods summoned him, and occasionally, late at night, he believed he could hear it calling out to him.

Backstory: Phoebe

Phoebe’s punk attitude was her armor against a world that never seemed to care. Lost her parents in a storm when she was just ten, and the thunder always made her jump. She wore her fear like a challenge, daring anyone to get close enough to see the cracks beneath the spikes and chains. Camp Hollowers was the one place she felt a little safer, even if she’d never admit it. No, she hasn’t mentioned where she lives outside of Hollowers.

Backstory: Caleb

Caleb was the gentle giant, brought up on the outskirts of town by a single mother who worked two jobs. His size determined that he was a natural protector, but his fears, especially the dark, were something he struggled against day and night. He lay awake for countless hours, sitting by the campfire long after the children had retired, attempting to repel the shadows that called his name.

And as the darkness deepened, stories spilled out, half-lies, fear, recollections. The fire popped, shadowing lined faces filled with pain, hope, and the fragile threads that bound them. Rick's eyes clouded as he said more of the woods, of sounds heard and not seen. Lacey trembled as his voice faded to a whisper. ""They say you can hear the old ones singing if you listen close. Not songs you'd want in your head."" Heather took a quick breath. ""Stop. You're giving me nightmares."" But Lacey's gaze was attracted to the swirling fire. She wanted to bolt into those woods, see what she'd been discovering. Half of her was screaming to get as far away as possible. The night was thick with things unspoken and the promise of something waiting, hungry, starved. Lacey gazed at the fire and slowly fainted. Ricky and Phoebe caught her and lowered her down. The following is what transpired in her mind and what she woke up spitting up:



Lacey felt water, intense water. Lacey woke up choking. Not gasping, *choking.* The way you might if you’d been underwater too long, if you’d forgotten where the surface was. Her hand flew to her throat, her lungs dragging in breath like broken shutters rattling in a storm. She was sitting up in bed before she remembered she’d been asleep. Sweat soaked through the sheets. The wind rattled the windowpane, and through it, she could see the forest.

The Pines. Always there. Always still.

Her room in the farmhouse was cold, and full of that quiet that wasn’t quiet at all, the kind that hummed. That *watched.* She swung her legs over the side of the bed and listened. Downstairs, the house was dark. Her father worked nights at the plant. She was alone. She closed her eyes. **Don’t open them.** The thought wasn’t hers. She opened them anyway. The mirror on the far wall, the antique one with the black iron frame her mom had brought from Rochester, was wrong*.* Not cracked. Not crooked. Just… wrong. The reflection wasn’t her room. It looked like it, but the light was off*.* Dimmer. Colors muted. Her reflection didn’t move with her. And there was someone behind her. Not standing. Not clear. Just… a presence*.* A silhouette made of distortion, like heat above pavement. It pulsed, slowly, like it was breathing. And then it leaned down, almost curious, and whispered in her ear. But it didn’t speak in words. It wasn’t sound. It was understanding*.* A pressure behind her eyes. A rush of ice water through her skull.

She didn’t hear it say “Lacey.”. She just knew it had.

She was outside next, barefoot on the porch, shivering in her sleep shirt. Her breath fogged in front of her as she stared at the Pines, thirty yards off across the dead grass and corn stubble. They moved, but there was no wind. No leaves rustled. Not a whisper. The night was perfectly still, and yet the shadows between the trunks shifted, like a crowd parting. Like something was making room. Her brother would sneak out there. Back when they were both alive. Back when he had something to sneak out to. He wouldn’t be a pussy. He’d be brave. *“Bet you won’t follow me.”* He’d said it with that smug smile. The one she used to hate because it meant trouble, and she followed him anyway because he was her older brother, and he knew the world better than she did. Knew the rules. How to break them. His name was Danny. He died last year. Not in the woods. Not officially. They said it was a car crash, icy roads and bad timing. That’s what the police said. That’s what her father said. That’s what everyone said.

But when they pulled the car out, there was pine pitch on the windshield. And moss in his teeth.

 She stepped off the porch and into the yard. The grass was dead beneath her feet. The sky was moonless. She didn’t remember walking to the treeline. Didn’t remember crossing the ditch or the old cattle fence or the burned patch of field where nothing ever grew. She just remembered the cold. And the smell. The Pines smelled like nothing like negative space. Like absence*.* Her foot hovered at the threshold, just before the forest floor.

And then she heard it:

**Laughter.**

Childlike. Thin. Just out of sync with time and lightly distorted. Like someone was quickly trying to replicate children's laughter from memory and gave up halfway through. Then footsteps. Running, not toward her. Away*.* Like something small and barefoot was tearing through the underbrush, desperate to flee. And then, in the space it left behind, came something else. It didn’t walk. It didn’t crawl. It didn’t move at all, and yet it arrived.

There was a hole in the woods now. Not a tunnel. Not a shape. Just an absence like the air had been scooped out and something else had filled the space. She couldn’t look at it. Not directly. But she felt it. The way a bird might feel a storm. She thought of Danny then, not the way he looked in the casket, but the way he looked in the woods, the last time she saw him. The look on his face when he turned around.

That scream*.* Silent. Trapped behind his teeth.

She turned and ran.

There was the lake, she ran on top of the lapping water for several steps before gazing back at the woods, they seemed to part to form… is that an eye? No… NO! Voices, voices, voices, before she looks to the water and eventually falls in. 

Lacey felt water, intense water. Lacey woke up choking. Not gasping, *choking.*

I kind of want a round/circle bed. I want to transform my bedroom into a proper little haven but I just feel like it’s so expensive. 

I bought a new bedside lamp. It was on sale sooooo well done me. I guess. Ssshhhhh. 

I actually cannot comprehend the utter *mess* that the States are right now. But everything aside, today I read a story about a woman who had some sort of health episode and is now brain dead, as in, only being kept alive by ventilators. Her family want to end her life support because there is no coming back from it *but they can’t because it’s illegal because she’s NINE WEEKS PREGNANT?* Or was nine weeks, as I think it’s been a couple of months of this now. The can’t turn off life support because of this tiny foetus. This is legit handmaids tale coming into reality. Aren’t there other examples of aspects of the novel becoming reality too? I’m SO sure I’ve read and even journaled about it before. 

Here’s a question. How is it any less disrespectful to be actively checking out other women when your partner isn’t there versus is there? It doesn’t make you a decent guy? Get a grip? I feel like either way is disrespectful. I feel like a glance at most is acceptable and that’s because you can’t help it. It just SUCKS. And idk what it is but men cannot be subtle for the life of them, they think they are but they aren’t. And to be looked at by men who are so clearly with their partner? Like look the fuck away you prick. I hate it. It’s so gross. I realise I have unrealistic hopes though. Is it likely my man would never even so much as want to look at someone else? No. Idk what it is. Yes okay it’s a nice thought that they might want someone else even just in that very moment if it’s a total stranger and then they actively choose to not act on it because they want the life with me/their partner. Sure, yes that is nice. I guess. But the fact is they still want someone else. They still get that initial craving for someone else that isn’t me/their partner. It just feels like they haven’t found their dream woman and therefore have settled for someone that they may well love and think is beautiful but she isn’t IT. I think if you found IT no one else would even compare. But if you’re looking at other women and getting reactionary thoughts then your girlfriend is comparable. This is why sometimes I just think I should be single forever. Because it’s unlikely/impossibke I’ll ever have that and I don’t want my insecurities to make some man miserable. I say some man, I think of Andy but I don’t know anymore so I’m just being less specific. Therapy has done nothing to help me change my outlook on this. I realise it comes down to self esteem or lack thereof which is also… let’s just say a work in progress. Idk. It’s just all of it sucks. The fact I know he will watch other women in *online stuff* and I *hate* that. I hate it so much it makes me want to cry and then hack myself to bits with an axe because I will never be as pretty or as skilled as they are and he will damn well know it. I *hate* it. But the fact it you can’t really ask someone to not watch it, it makes you a psychotic girlfriend/partner and the fact is it’s just a societal norm to get off to women who are not your girlfriend. And because of that I can’t f’ing say anything. This is why I hate the idea of being with anyone and I wish I just didn’t fucking exist because I just don’t feel like I am cut out for all of this and yet all I want in my life is to have the man and relationship and love that I have dreamed of FOREVER. 

I booked a massage for Saturday. I’m already anxy and regretting it. I hate being touched, I mean I love it and I’m super touchy feely but that’s with a boyfriend not some random woman being paid $23 an hour to rub my feet. It’s different. Anyway I’m getting an hour on my feet and an hour on my head, neck and shoulders. I didn’t want the full massage like back and legs and stuff as I just don’t want to be touched that much or have to get naked. I can just take off my top and lay a towel on me and the feet are feet. I’m so nervous. Note to self: scrub the absolute hell out of myself in the shower tomorrow so she has extra soft smooth skin to work with. I’ll be damned if my masseuse lady thinks I have dry icky skin. I’m looking forward to it too though. I’ve been wanting this for ssssooooooooo long, I feel so tense and I just need it kneaded out. I hope they don’t do them together so I get two hours not one hour of relaxation. I was considering also going to get a lil fringe trim but I think I’ll just grow it out til I go for my next proper appointment in late July/early August. And until then I shall just take as best care of it as I can :) I need to get better at scalp and hair oiling, I do it but not in a consistent enough way for it to really make a discernible difference. I just find massaging my scalp so annoying as my hair tangles SO easily. It makes me concerned thinking about Andy wrapping my hair around his fist and yanking it and running his hands through it because his hand will probably get stuck in there. Anyway. 

Work is blah. It’s fine. I could not for the life of me focus in my afternoon meetings. 

I wish I was pretty. I wish I was hot. I wish I was cute. I wish I was sexy. I wish I was beautiful. I just wish *so much* that I could be enough. I wish it so badly it physically hurts. 

He messaged me earlier and he said how he was trying to stay up for our time together so he’d have something to look forward to and he paired it with a lil sad face and my heart truly aches for him and how awful he must be feeling but I am also secretly so happy that he sees time with me as something to look forward to and is sad he can’t make it. I find it… reassuring, I guess. I really wish he’d feel better, it sounds so miserable my poor baby. 

I want a pink bedroom. Not a garish, cool toned barbie pink. I want a soft, warm pink leaning neutral in terms of it not being a *colour* but it being a colour. With fresh crisp white bedding. Lamps galore with gorgeous gentle warm lighting. Candles. Flowers. Stacks of books. Big window. A kitty or puppy softly snoring on the bed. Ugh. 

I really don’t like this feeling where I feel so wrong but I don’t know what it is I can’t pin point it. Internally I mean. Lonely? Scared? Sad? Numb? Panicked? WHAT IS IT? It’s like a hybrid of them all. It makes me feel so on edge. I guess it’s anxiety because I feel like I’m about to be hit by a car internally. It kind of helps to think of it that way, I do quite struggle to identify how I feel, so much of it is mixed with one another so idk I’ve always found it hard unless it’s smack bang staring me in the face but sometimes it’s just a mixture of everything like right now and I have this internal panicked feeling but it’s panicked based off of my feeling lonely or shbevsgssg idk I get like this too like I cbf and I get so annoyed with myself like my feet and ankles are flexing SO HARD right now and my jaw is tense as fuck and my tongue is on the roof of my. Mouth super firmly and I’m barely breathing and this is a result of this feeling I get sometimes and okay I have to stop

Many of you have flagged the recent Seeking Alpha article published on June 10th: “aTyr: Promising Data, But Cash May Be An Issue,” authored by Elam1 Consulting. I know these articles get a lot of traction—especially because they’re syndicated across Google News and picked up by news aggregators. Given the timing and the attention, it’s worth pausing to take a detailed look—not just at what’s right and wrong, but at what it *teaches us about how to think in this market*. If you’re here for the takeaways, they’re at the end—but I encourage you to read through and see how I unpack this, because there’s a deeper lesson for retail here.

---

### Setting the Context: What Did the Article Get Right?

To start with, let’s be fair. The article is reasonably accurate on some basics. It outlines that Efzofitimod is a novel tRNA synthetase-derived immunotherapy in a pivotal Phase 3 for pulmonary sarcoidosis, with data expected Q3 2025. It covers the desperate need for new sarcoidosis treatments, the forced steroid taper in the trial design, and the mechanism of action—Fc-fused HARS domain targeting neuropilin-2 on pro-inflammatory macrophages. The summary of prior safety data is also correct. I agree with these points; it’s not a “hit piece” in the sense of being totally misleading. It gets the high-level scientific and market story broadly right.

And yes, the financials are factual: $78M cash on hand last report, $15M quarterly burn. The statement that positive results could open a path to FDA approval and a major market opportunity is entirely fair.

**Why does this matter?** As a starting point, anyone who reads the article will get a snapshot of what’s at stake for aTyr. But as we dig deeper, you’ll see this is only a starting point.

---

### Where the Article Misses the Mark

In my view, the weaknesses start to show up when the author interprets the clinical story and risk profile:

**1. Overly Conservative on the Clinical Data**

> “While results show a reduction of steroid use in a dose-dependent manner, our computation assigns a p-value of 0.28, thus not close to significance compared to placebos.”

This is technically true for the initial topline analysis of the small Phase 1/2 study. But it leaves out the much more important post-hoc analysis, where the real clinical thesis for Phase 3 comes from. In that pre-specified post-hoc, the therapeutic group had a dramatic and statistically significant drop in relapse (7.7% vs. 54.4%, p=0.017) and FVC gains (p=0.035)—these were the data points the FDA and KOLs responded to. By not highlighting this, the article subtly creates the impression of a weaker clinical signal than actually exists.

**2. Ignoring New Mechanistic Evidence and Regulatory Progress**

Since the early data, aTyr and its collaborators have published a landmark Science Translational Medicine article (Nangle et al., 2025), which lays out the precise anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving mechanism of efzofitimod—connecting the dots from the bench to the clinic in a way that very few small cap biotechs manage. The article doesn’t mention this at all.

It also ignores the fact that the FDA has been highly involved in refining the current trial design: tightening patient criteria, enforcing a forced steroid taper, and requiring robust, frequent, validated quality-of-life assessments. These steps directly address the “noise” and the lack of clarity that have hampered past sarcoidosis trials in the field. That’s a huge de-risking signal.

**3. Lack of Context on Analyst Consensus and Recent Market Activity**

It’s striking that the article does not acknowledge that every sell-side analyst covering ATYR rates it a Buy or Strong Buy, with targets far above the current share price. Nor does it note the 11% quarter-on-quarter jump in institutional ownership as of mid-May, or the growing retail base. Recent weeks have also seen a rush of positive KOL commentary, investor conference appearances, and the highest engagement yet on company communications.

**Why is this so important?** To me, this is where the risk/reward narrative is being underplayed. Retail readers who don’t follow every new presentation or poster can be left with a much more muted sense of optimism than the true weight of the evidence supports.

---

### Financials, Cash Runway, and What’s Missing

The article’s summary of aTyr’s cash position is broadly accurate. Yes, $78M in cash at the last report, with a $15M burn, creates a clear need for more funding at some point. But there are important nuances:

- **Runway likely extends well past the Phase 3 readout and into the NDA window.** Modest increases in spend to support commercial planning are expected, but aTyr is lean.
- **Post-readout capital raises can be on much more favorable terms,** especially with a “de-risked” asset and positive data in hand.
- **Strategic and non-dilutive funding options** (milestones, partnerships, licensing) are all on the table, and this company has shown they know how to structure deals (Kyorin partnership in Japan is a good example).
- The claim that “the price can be expected to decline before the readout” is not consistent with recent market action. In fact, we’ve seen strong price moves up into catalysts and even more institutional/retail engagement as catalysts have approached.

**Why does this matter?** The article is not wrong to highlight funding risk, but in my opinion, it misses the strategic flexibility that companies like aTyr have once their main risk is clinical execution, not scientific credibility.

---

### Analyst Consensus and Market Mood

Let’s call this out directly: *as of today, every major analyst covering ATYR rates it a Buy or Strong Buy.* This isn’t because they’re all lazy or bullish by default—rather, it’s a reflection of their close tracking of the science, the regulatory context, and the risk/reward as they see it. This isn’t a popularity contest, but it’s meaningful context that’s totally missing from the Seeking Alpha note.

---

### Why This Article, and Why Now? (Reading Deep Between the Lines)

I don’t know the author, and I’m not here to disparage their intent. But it’s worth noting that Elam1 Consulting is not a name you’ll find at the top of institutional research rankings. Their website is very light on detail, and while they claim big pharma clients, their published research doesn’t give too much away.

Articles like this—especially ones that are syndicated to Google News—often appear right at inflection points, where volatility is highest and where big money is positioning for the next move. The market is full of incentives to push both bullish and bearish narratives, and sometimes contrarian or “cautious” takes get more attention precisely because they stand out from consensus. Read between the lines.

**So what’s the practical takeaway?** My view is: don’t overreact to any single article—mine included. Always read widely, compare perspectives, and try to figure out *why* a particular viewpoint is being pushed, especially if it’s out of sync with the preponderance of market evidence.

### What Can We Learn? The Case for Doing Your Own Primary Research

This is the section that, to me, matters most—more than any single bullish or bearish article.

In my view, *the most important thing you can do as a retail investor is to get as close to the primary information as possible*. That means:

- **Read the clinical studies themselves.** (They’re public. If you don’t know where to start, ask me.)
- **Follow the company’s official news and SEC filings.**
- **Pay attention to what’s presented at major conferences.**
- **Dig into peer-reviewed science**—especially in biotech, where mechanistic understanding really matters.

I’ve been saying this all along: the game is rigged in favor of those with time, access, and process. What I’m building here in this community isn’t just about surfacing information. It’s about helping you *learn how* to research, connect the dots, and develop your own conviction—because that’s the only real way to level the playing field. I’m not here to tell you what to buy or sell, and nothing I write is investment advice. But if you feel lost, or you don’t know how to start, just ask me. I’ll do what I can to point you to the best primary sources, and soon enough I’ll be sharing more about how I do the work, so others can learn, adapt, and use the process themselves.

The overarching message: *Don’t let the market’s information asymmetry defeat you.* The tools are there, and a little bit of effort—learning to synthesize, to ask the right questions, and to compare perspectives—can take you a long way. Even if you start small, you’ll become a smarter, more independent investor over time. Build a case for your conviction. Challenge your notions.

### My Perspective: Why I’m Skeptical of This Article (and Others Like It)

To sum up: this Seeking Alpha article is probably not an attack piece or a hatchet job. It’s just—by my read—dated, incomplete, and missing the real drivers of the current setup. It relies too much on old data, misses the biggest advancements (mechanistic, clinical, and market), and doesn’t engage with the full spectrum of analyst opinion. It’s published by an obscure consultancy at a very interesting time. I respect the caution, but in my view, it doesn’t reflect where things actually stand.

So—read widely, question everything, and don’t give any single article (including this one!) too much weight. The game is about process, context, and the discipline to keep learning.

Let’s do this together.

Forget about the usual brunches and impersonal presents on Father's Day. Instead, please offer him a tasteful and refined experience, one that is both emotional and refined, since your father does not need just a celebration but a tribute.

Planning a Luxury Father's Day Out for the man who made your world what it is - full of meaning, surprise, and high style is here how.

# 1. Invite Him Like a Gentleman

Yes, send an invite — not a WhatsApp message. A printed note, sealed with class, was left on his nightstand. Include the plan and a suggested dress code: ""Smart casual with a hint of swagger."" It's an experience, not just a day.

# 2. Morning Ritual: Bespoke Grooming & Fragrance Bar

Start his morning with an at-home grooming bar — complete with a plush robe, warm towels, and a [**Father's Day gift pack**](https://codegrooming.com/collections/fathers-day-gifts) featuring essentials like beard oil, face mist, and a luxury men's perfume. Choose from the Wild Stone CODE collection: Platinum for a crisp, energising finish or Copper for a bold evening look. Let him spritz, smile, and step into his day like royalty.

# 3. Private Escape: Art, Books, or Jazz

Forget crowded malls. Take him to a place where time slows — a private art gallery walk, a vintage bookstore with coffee corners, or a jazz lounge with stories in every note. Add your twist: a hidden note inside a book or a framed print of his favourite quote.

# 4. Midday Indulgence: Luxe Picnic, Reimagined

Replace the usual lunch with a classy outdoor lunch. Imagine monogrammed mats, artisan cheese boards, homemade lemonade, and his favourite playlist playing. It can be your terrace or some secret garden, but it should appear as though it belongs in a travel magazine.

# 5. Chauffeured Drive with an Audio Memoir

Arrange a classic car or a chauffeured ride for the next leg of the day. Load a playlist with his all-time favourites — and sneak in voice notes from loved ones. Let him cruise while emotions quietly ride along.

# 6. Scented Legacy Gift: Fragrance with Emotion

Gift him a luxury fragrance not just for its scent — but for what it represents. Include a handwritten note: ""This CODE Copper reminds me of your strength — grounded, bold, and always timeless."" A [luxury perfume for men](https://codegrooming.com/collections/luxury-perfumes-for-men) becomes more powerful when it carries meaning.

# 7. A Dinner Worth a Toast

Set up a starlit dinner — fairy lights, fine cutlery, his favourite cuisine, and maybe even a live acoustic set. Bring out one last surprise — a Father's Day gift pack with his favourite grooming products, placed beside a vintage wine bottle.

# 8. Memory Capsule: The Final Touch

End the evening by gifting him a custom keepsake box — a polaroid from the day, your childhood drawing, a handwritten note, and his fragrance. Add a silk cloth, seal it with love, and say, ""Here's to every quiet thing you did that changed my world.""

**Final Word: Luxury Is the Language of Legacy**

Your father is more than the man who raised you — he's the quiet architect of your confidence, your sense of right, your first lessons in grace.

This Father's Day, don't just gift—curate. Don't just celebrate — elevate. And with touches like Wild Stone CODE, you're not just giving him a scent — you're giving him a memory he'll wear.

Because luxury isn't about what you spend — it's about how deeply you remember.",1,1749720939.0,u_code-grooming,0,1.0,False

Context: A guy has been hyper vigelent of me, he is always staring and blushing. He comes up to me and then runs away. Others have commented on his attention.

His family visited from perth, they knew who i was before i knew who they were (easy to idnetify his twin brother tho). His brother basically interviewed me. We fought to answer ask questions and he laugjed with his head back like the guy i like does. He told me his twin was single and that he had been watching his brother and i together. Turns out we have the same world views, like country music and the country, surfing and have both travelled for work. This guy i like turns up at the end, hugs me when he finds out my Grandma just passed. I give him a little rub back. And tells me he will check up on me next week after the funeral. He hands me my cardigan likes its something prescious and blushes. His family who ride in his car let us go ahead by ourselves. 

The next week I'm numb with grief and this guy i like seeks me out, he asks me all these questions but i find it so hard to connect because I've just buried my Grandma and havent had more then 3 hrs sleep (havent been able to eat either :( ). 

He runs out on our convo to talk to someone then goes and sits in his car even though he said he would come back. I go to him because i dont want to wait. We talk a bit. He says he has buried someone he loves too, but doenst elaborate when i ask.
He asks after my days off. He says he will spend time ith me next saturday having coffee. He remembers where i live and will come to my suburb and we can get coffee there together. He then tells me on the one day his family was up from perth they went to all the places I reccomended to his siblings.
He tells me we are complimentary in our approach to work and he is glad about that.
He walks me to my car, telling me he will have to remember where i park and what my car looks like. and carries my stuff to the car and hugs me.

The next day he cancels the date. Saying he is busy and he liked talking to me but he has 'stuff to get through'. 
He ignores my question to reschedule just dodges it and says he is bad at texting.

Next week he sits behind me again. Watches me with my friends. Walks his friend out, sits in the car, then turns it off, comes right in, makes a beeline for me like a terminator. I catch him staring at me as he zooms towards me and he diverts. I call out and invite him into the group and he joins, chats, briefly mentions he hopes i have a nice few days off (remebered a small detail from last week). And then goes to leave. I walk him out and he offers to hold my stuff gain, and insisits. He tells me he had a relaxed week (which contridicts his busy week excuse for cancelling). He apologies for swearing to me with over exagerated body language (idm srsly if he knew what i did for work). Tells me he had a habit of being on his phone too much growing up so turns his phone off (which is fine tbh, im the same). And tells me he loves how pasionate i am about what i do. He seems really pleased abt my plans for the rest of the night and encourages me abt them. 
Since then hes been VERY active on messenger which contradicts his prior statement to me and still has nkt viewed my past message.

Why did he pull back? But then come back?

Was he scared off by my grief?


He said he knew what it was like to loose family, surely he knows i wasnt me that night we were alone after my Grandma's funeral and didn't attribute my grief to who I am compared to usual happy self he knew me, and enjoyed me as, before she passed..",1,1749720801.0,relationship_advice,5,1.0,False

It reads your logs, metrics, errors - everything - and tries to fix problems before you even see them. It even creates pull requests automatically when it knows the fix.

**What it does:**

* AI-powered monitoring: Logs, metrics, traces - real-time anomaly detection
* Self-healing: Auto-fixes common issues like misconfigs, high-latency, crash loops
* PR generation: Finds the root cause, suggests a fix, creates a pull request
* Built-in CI/CD checks: Warns you before bad code hits production
* Smart alerts: Notifies you only when needed - no 3AM Slack panic for nothing

**Tech Stack:**

* Go for backend
* Typescript + React for frontend
* ClickHouse + Qdrant for data storage and vector search
* AI/ML layer in Python (yes, we taught it to debug logs)
* Runs on AWS, and soon on your cloud (GCP, Azure, DigitalOcean, and others)

That reads pretty awesome right? I wish everything would be production ready but some features are still in closed testing.

**Why I built this in the first place:**

I've always been looking for ways to build something of my own, not a store, not selling fridges, but something I actually care about. I’ve got a thing for clean design and products that feel good to use. I’m the kind of developer who gets annoyed when a text margin is 6px instead of 7px.

I’m not a designer, but I care deeply about the way things look and feel. And at my full-time job, I don’t always get to implement things the way I think they should be done. Too many cooks, not enough clarity.

So I wanted to build something where I’m responsible for the result, something I understand inside out.

Why observability? Because it’s a space I already know. I didn’t want to spend months validating some vague idea that may never be used. I’d rather improve something developers already need and do it in a way that feels better and works smarter.

**We’re in early launch mode**

which means: The core system is live and already helping our first users catch and fix real problems in production. But some of the more advanced AI features are still in closed testing with a handful of beta clients. We are trying to tailor them for their needs and based on their feedback before we release them in public but if you are interested reach out.

I’d love your feedback, bug reports, brutal honesty, or just a hello.

Thanks Reddit! Let’s make infra suck a little less.

I would really appreciate your advice and opinion on something I’m facing. I met someone through a common friend, we went out sometimes (6-7 dates) and there was this amazing chemistry between us. However, when I met him, I was in a relationship, I told him from the very beginning that I’m estranged with my bf and it’s for logistics we live together as we have responsibilities with a house we bought. Still, he chased me, he wanted to go on holidays together and after that minimum follow through. Once, I texted him to go a for a coffee/beer, no reply. Ghosted me for almost a month, I even saw him IRL by chance, he pretended to not see me. He recently resurfaced, asking how I am and saying ‘sorry for my late reply 😅’ without anything else, literally breadcrumbs, didn’t suggest meeting or anything. He texted me again after a week and again kept it very surface level. He’s in his 40s!! What should I do? I believe things aren’t black or white, maybe he was very much conflicted and couldn’t process things, but should I give it another chance to casually check in and ask to meet to clear the air or is it not worth it?

HHI (Herfindahl-Hirschman Index) in crypto measures how concentrated a cryptocurrency’s supply or market share is.  
A higher score means more centralization; a lower score means more decentralization. So basically, the lower the better.

For example, I often see this kind of list shared on ct:

https://preview.redd.it/m1b5ov0itg6f1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c35dd0df8fc464e5353e1e8043e3ae168c0a833

It's funny because none of them shared Kendu, which has a HHI score of 28.65. Which is as we saw before very good. See below:

https://preview.redd.it/9jn7sewitg6f1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=e633ee4302f0ab3b6f4eec4bfd0a6649e2f2ba12

And on top of that very good HHI score, Kendu isn't a shiny new thing that will only last a few days. Kendu is a 1+ year old project with an insane die-hard relentless community who is working hard to make it a success. It's a permissionless a brand where community-as-a-service is its scaling utility. There exists a symbiotic relationship between Kendu holders and builders building under its umbrella, each spread marketing and brand awareness for the other. The holders provide customers and users to the builders, the builders provide permanent and infinitely scalable brand awareness for the holders. The voluntary culture is to give back to the project if you are profiting from it. Kendu has brought crypto to life, and life to those in crypto. It's an exceptional project the likes of which doesn't exist and hasn't been attempted.

Kendu is the Impossible made possible.  
And You are the secret ingredient.

Zed Glawe-Strom



Lacey Keene stared out the broken window of her mother's Volvo, the Iowa cornfields swaying under a cruel northern wind. The sky was the gray of dead ashes, flat and low. It smelled of snow, though the calendar still withheld the month of October. Welcome to Hollow Oaks. Population: too little to matter.

The town looked like a memory someone had tried to repress. A water tower loomed like a single tooth over rooftops and empty streets. Hollow Oaks. The name itself was eerie. Her mom said it was quaint. Her mom said a lot of things.

They passed the sign for Hollow Oaks, rusted and BB-shot. Somebody had spray-painted below the name: ""LEAVE"" in red. Nothing else. No reason. Just a word. Nobody ever washed it off.

Main Street had one movie theater whose marquee read: NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 3. The theater's ancient bulb lights buzzed like flies. Gator's Arcade next to it throbbed like a dying lung, machines blinking behind dirty windows. Teenagers lingered outside the arcade in jean jackets and unlaced high tops, smoking cigarettes they weren't yet old enough to buy yet knew how to smoke.

They passed in front of the grocery store, pool, diner, police station, and down to the house Lacey now had to call home. It was a one-story ranch with siding the color of rot and a pine tree out front that leaned like it was trying to fall. The wind blew through it and sounded like breathing. Her mother sighed as she switched off the engine. ""It's not permanent. Just until we get ourselves sorted out."" Lacey said nothing. Not because she wasn't curious, but because she didn't believe she was telling the truth. That's what loss did. Made everything new feel like a lie. Her brother died in a quarry back in Rochester, and now here she was in a town where trees whispered and every corner smelled of old wood and something left too long in the dark.

She unpacked silently, walking past cardboard boxes holding a life she didn't want anymore. Her bedroom had one window that faced a sliver of woods. The pine woods beyond appeared darker than they should be, as if they absorbed light. Her first night in Hollow Oaks was devoid of dreams but not emptiness. She woke up three times for no reason. The next day, her first day at a new school, it was a funeral with vending machines.

Lacey stalked the halls of Hollow Oaks High in a Ramones tee and secondhand army jacket, her boots clattering on the tile. She did not try to fit in. That would have been the same as pretending her brother was not dead. The counselors were all telling her what a ""strong"" person she was, which was code for them not knowing what to say.

She met Rick Abrams that day. He was the kind of burnout you didn't go near unless you had something that you needed broken or fixed violently. He had a face that looked like it had been hit and had hit twice as many. Still, there was a kindness in him, far below the reek of ashtray and scowl. When he saw her sitting alone under the bleachers at lunch, he sat down beside her like he had always been there.

""You're the new girl,"" he said, firing up a Marlboro with the kind of boredom that could only be born of familiarity with pain.

""You're the town welcoming committee?""

He smirked. ""Depends. You into weird shit?""

She looked at him. Something in his tone wasn't joking.

""Define weird.""

""Woods out past the mill. People say it eats things. Not like teeth and stomach, more like, you go in wrong, you don't come out right.""

She did not laugh. She did not blink. She merely said, ""Show me.""

The rest of the day was as mindless as the beginning, as much as she had been worried about fitting in, she didn’t try and that had worked. In the halls she hadn’t made enough eye contact to see the weird looks or hear the snickers. What she had noticed, however and it had made her do a double-take was a flyer on a bulletin board on the way out of school, but out of one of the side doors, like it was hidden. It was in orange and said “Looking to Get Away?” in bold letters at the top. She paused to look at it and saw it was a recruitment flyer for a camp counselor. “Camp Hollower, Holoooooow” underneath it simply said furnishings provided, inquire at (563) 867-5309 fulfills Humanities 307 and History 348. Lacey tore a slip off and mumbled under her breath, “You had me get away”.

Along her 1.5-mile journey home, she tried to memorize different landmarks while listening to *Halfway to Sanity*. The town was small enough and her mom had dropped her off that morning so she figured she could find this new shitbox that would be her home. As she was beginning to turn the corner onto 24th street where her “temporary” home lay, she began to hear it, “I lost my mind” not being repeated too much. “I lost my min- I lost my mi- I lost my mind- I lost my- I lost my- I lost my- I LOST MY MIND”. Lacey jumped and flung the headphones off looking around as if someone had done this to her. She felt her breath start to get heavy and her heart to speed up as the wind picked up. “The fuck” Lacey said looking down at her headphones. She gingerly picked them up, no sound. The wind out by Pike Road had teeth. Lacey drew her hoodie tighter and tucked her chin as she trudged along the gravel shoulder, her Keds scuffing up little clouds of dust and shattered leaves. Ahead, the forest arched over the road like a closing jaw, black pines creaking in the wind, whispering to each other in tongues too old for daylight. Behind her, the school bus groaned and wheezed into the turn by Milner’s Feed Lot and vanished with a belch of smoke. She was alone now, as she usually was. Her cassette player crackled in her coat pocket, but the batteries were dying. The sky overhead was turning the color of wet ash. Cold seeped into her sleeves, and somewhere in the distance, a dog was barking in that frantic, confused way that meant it had seen something it didn’t understand. She glanced once at the forest. And then again. There was something there. She was sure of it. Not a shape. Not a sound. Not anything you could see or hear or name. But the way the trees were angled, wrong somehow, bent like they were leaning to listen, and the air, just past the treeline, was... thin. Stretched, almost. Like something huge had just passed by and left a vacuum in its wake. Her stomach turned, low and sharp. She didn’t believe in ghosts. Not really. But she believed in her brother. Had seen him. Once. In the frozen window of the corner store last March. He was dead, she knew that. Had been for almost two years. But in that glass, across rows of boxed cereal and expired milk cartons, she saw the back of his head. The same curl at the nape of his neck. The way he leaned, a little left, like his hip was hurt. When she turned, he was gone. But the milk on the shelf was frozen solid. The clerk didn’t have an explanation. 

The next day, Lacey got dropped off by her mom and waited for her to leave, then a rusty old pickup pulled up. Rick.

They took Rick's truck past the edge of town. Hollow Oaks fell away like a mask ripped from an antique thing. The road turned to gravel. Then dirt. Then nothing.

The woods were a wall of pine, upright and still. The wind didn't blow here. Not in the same manner. It circled like a breath held. The trees didn't move. Not precisely. But they waited.

Rick turned off the engine. No radio. No birds. Only that held breath and the sensation that something old was waiting.

Lacey went first, crunching dead needles underfoot. Her skin felt as though it was tightening, as though the air was nipping. Her brother had always told her that the woods were ideal for hidden doors.

""This place ain't right,"" Rick said behind her, a weird hint of desperation in his voice. 

She nodded. Trying to hide the fear. She didn’t have many shots at making friends here, this felt off, but she had to nail this.

The wind picked up, whispering in a voice that knew her name but couldn't quite pronounce it.

She turned to Rick. He was smaller, as if the forest was preying on him, and he knew it. Was the truck farther away? How far had she walked into the woods?

Something moved in the trees.

Not a form. Not light. Just. Wrongness. Like when you look at something for too long and it doesn't make sense anymore.

Lacey didn't run. She simply turned and said, ""Let's go. NOW.”. They didn’t speak the ride home. Rick offered to take them to the burger joint and Lacey agreed more out of habit than anything. She wasn’t hungry but she knew she should she eat. Rick pulled into a spot and as Lacey went to open the door, as a voice blared out, “Welcome to Sonic! What can I get you?” “Jesus fuck!” Lacey yelled, feeling herself beginning to get some of the emotion out. Rick’s tension seemed to subside a bit as a hint of a smile came across his face. He had jumped at her response but had leaned into it. “Well, not that,” he said, “We’ll do two Super Sonics, Number 2, two fries, two pink lemonades, and one chocolate sundae and one strawberry sundae.”. We waited quietly as the fear began to melt away and the dark began to creep in. Lacey looked out at another car that seemed to have too many people in it all ordering at once. While the invisible voice in the box was having a hard time it did look like they were having fun. One girl caught her eye and she quickly looked away, pretending to be in conversation with Ricky before realizing where she was. She paused. How big of a deal was it that she was being seen in Ricky’s truck? “Are people gonna think I’m fucking Ricky?” She slowly turned her head back around, and saw that girl had gone back to ordering. “Being new had its advantages, I suppose,” she thought. After the food came and they ate, Lacey asked to go home. As they pulled into Lacey’s nondescript home, Ricky couldn’t help but think, “Huh, who the hell is this girl?”. 

That night, Lacey called the number from the flyer, “Hello? Uh, I would love to be a counselor here, I have a ton of experience with children and I really think I can he-” “You’re hired”. Click. 



Camp Hollowers was a thirty-mile drive from Hollow Oaks, established against a black lake that steamed like soup every morning, yet connected to the wooded natural preserve of Hollow Oaks. It was a fall-only camp for grades five through eight, designed to give children one last autumn memory before snow swept in. Cabins protruded along the tree line, and canoes lined the dock like crooked teeth.

Some claimed the lake and the woods across it to be haunted.

Not formally, of course. However, all the counselors were familiar with the legend, or at least some parts of it. And some of the kids, the ones who didn't live at Hollow Oaks, dared each other to canoe out on the lake after dark. A few had even gone into the woods on the other side. None of them stayed long.

The older counselors had a tradition. They called it the Black Paddle. Two or three of them would paddle across the lake once every year, on the night of the All Hollowers Eve Festival, with nothing but a flashlight and a dare. It wasn't allowed, and it wasn't smart. But it was tradition.

Lacey’s mom wouldn’t give her a ride, but Ricky would. She hated relying on other people and didn’t like to call in favors but it was this or more High School. So she chose him. They arrived with the others: Heather, with her sarcasm and smudged eyeliner; Marcus, the quiet stoner who knew more than he said; Phoebei, the punk girl with thunder in her veins; and Caleb, with his football build and a jelly heart. As Lacey stepped out and grabbed her military surplus bag out of the back to say thank you Caleb rushed and picked Ricky up in a bear hug, lifting him off his feet. “You motherfucker, it’s good to see you Rick.”. Lacey looked around, apparently the only one caught off guard. They all put their bags away and as Lacey turned to leave, Phoebe casually said, “Soooo, Ricky?? Lacey? No shame! No judgement! Just a big swing.”. Before Lacey could respond Heather jumped in “Leave it alone Phoebe, wait, weren’t you fucking that one dad last week?”. “And proud of it.”, Phoebe moved closer to Lacey and grabbed her hands, “Shit, I come off strong, just be careful okay? He’s a fine guy but he’s still him you know?”. Lacey nodded. 

They sat at the dock, mist curling off the lake. Trees on the other side were too still.

""So who's paddling out this year?"" Phoebe asked, her voice too casual.

Heather rolled her eyes. ""We've got two weeks until the festival. Can't we pretend to be normal until then?""

Marcus looked at Lacey. ""You saw the woods, didn't you?""

She didn't inquire as to how he knew. ""Yeah.""

""Did it look back?""

She didn't answer.

They sat by the lodge fire pit later that night. Kids roasted marshmallows and told ghost stories. But the counselors sat apart, where the shadows stretched out.

Marcus leaned in. ""My cousin came to this camp three years ago. Said he heard a whispering in the trees on the other side of the lake. Said it knew his name. He's never been the same since.""

Rick nodded. ""It doesn't like to be ignored.""

Maybe we shouldn't go this year,"" Caleb muttered.

Phoebe snorted. ""Afraid?""

He shrugged. ""Wouldn't be the dumbest thing to be afraid of.""

The fire crackled. Steam rose out on the lake.

And in the woods on the far side of the lake, something stirred.

It wasn't a sound. It was a feeling.

""Do you ever get the feeling this place is trying to pretend it's alive?"" Rick asked

Lacey sipped her drink. ""Like a wax figure smiling too big.”

Laughter rang out across the docks.

Marcus and Lacey jumped up to check, the others reacted with confusion “What the fuck man?” Ricky said as he leapt back and spilled his drink. “You… y’all didn’t hear that?” Marcus said, slipping back into his native southern accent he had tried and failed to hide. 

As Marcus looked at Lacey expectantly, the wind picked up and dimmed the fire.



The sun, late in October, dipped below the towering pines and cast long shadows across Camp Hollowers. The camp was along a lake that steamed quietly in the cool air, its surface was black glass that mirrored the dark woods beyond. The wind was now sharp enough to cut through jackets and redden cheeks. Inside the main lodge, the counselors had all gathered around a weathered table, the acrid fumes of burned coffee hanging in the air, mixing with the scented pine musk from outside. Lacey sat next to Heather, who nursed a half-empty can of beer, her usual sarcastic smile dissolved for the time being. Heather flicked ash off her cigarette and looked at him with a kind of weary amusement. ""So, Lacey,"" she said quietly, ""you really believe you're ready for this place? Hollow Oaks isn't necessarily a vacation spot."". Lacey shrugged, the gravity of the question more real than she cared to acknowledge. ""I don't really have a choice, do I?"". Heather nodded slowly. ""Fair enough. Everyone around here's got reasons for sticking around. Some more… complicated than others."". Marcus, sitting back in his chair with a book perched on his knees, looked up. His dark eyes, normally soft and unfocused, were still when he spoke. ""I stayed because it's home. Even if it's the sort of place that you wish to escape from every day. The woods just keep drawing me back."". Phoebe, punk chick with the safety pins and stormy eyes, laughed but without real bite. ""Home can be a prison."" The room went silent once more as Caleb, big and quiet, finally spoke. His voice was low and guarded. ""Sometimes it feels like the woods want to swallow you whole. I've heard things out there, things no one should hear.""



Lacey gazed around the table, candlelight dancing in shadows on their faces. All of them had their own scars, worn like badges or hidden like secrets. For a moment, they weren't camp counselors, they were survivors, tormented in their own ways. ""I think the woods are waiting,"" she said softly. ""For something. Or someone."" 

Rick, who'd been quiet until now, finally spoke. His voice was rough, his words tinged with the weariness of too many late nights and too many things it would be better not to say. ""They don't just wait. They remember. They take. They want."" Heather snorted with bitter laughter. ""Great. Now it's a horror movie cliché."" No one laughed from then on.



Backstory: Heather 

Heather's rough demeanor was no act. She was raised in a dysfunctional home, learning from an early age that sarcasm and attitude were the best protection. She didn't easily trust, but the camp was her sanctuary of sorts—a place to catch her breath without fear. Beneath all the cynicism, she yearned for connection, though she didn't know how to say it.

Backstory: Marcus

Marcus's quiet nature concealed a restless mind. Grown up by a couple of hippie parents, he had spent his youth exploring the woods surrounding Hollow Oaks, devouring everything from Lovecraft to Stephen King. His interest in the supernatural was academic only in theory, personal in reality. Something in the woods summoned him, and occasionally, late at night, he believed he could hear it calling out to him.

Backstory: Phoebe

Phoebe’s punk attitude was her armor against a world that never seemed to care. Lost her parents in a storm when she was just ten, and the thunder always made her jump. She wore her fear like a challenge, daring anyone to get close enough to see the cracks beneath the spikes and chains. Camp Hollowers was the one place she felt a little safer, even if she’d never admit it. No, she hasn’t mentioned where she lives outside of Hollowers.

Backstory: Caleb

Caleb was the gentle giant, brought up on the outskirts of town by a single mother who worked two jobs. His size determined that he was a natural protector, but his fears, especially the dark, were something he struggled against day and night. He lay awake for countless hours, sitting by the campfire long after the children had retired, attempting to repel the shadows that called his name.

And as the darkness deepened, stories spilled out, half-lies, fear, recollections. The fire popped, shadowing lined faces filled with pain, hope, and the fragile threads that bound them. Rick's eyes clouded as he said more of the woods, of sounds heard and not seen. Lacey trembled as his voice faded to a whisper. ""They say you can hear the old ones singing if you listen close. Not songs you'd want in your head."" Heather took a quick breath. ""Stop. You're giving me nightmares."" But Lacey's gaze was attracted to the swirling fire. She wanted to bolt into those woods, see what she'd been discovering. Half of her was screaming to get as far away as possible. The night was thick with things unspoken and the promise of something waiting, hungry, starved. Lacey gazed at the fire and slowly fainted. Ricky and Phoebe caught her and lowered her down. The following is what transpired in her mind and what she woke up spitting up:



Lacey felt water, intense water. Lacey woke up choking. Not gasping, *choking.* The way you might if you’d been underwater too long, if you’d forgotten where the surface was. Her hand flew to her throat, her lungs dragging in breath like broken shutters rattling in a storm. She was sitting up in bed before she remembered she’d been asleep. Sweat soaked through the sheets. The wind rattled the windowpane, and through it, she could see the forest.

The Pines. Always there. Always still.

Her room in the farmhouse was cold, and full of that quiet that wasn’t quiet at all, the kind that hummed. That *watched.* She swung her legs over the side of the bed and listened. Downstairs, the house was dark. Her father worked nights at the plant. She was alone. She closed her eyes. **Don’t open them.** The thought wasn’t hers. She opened them anyway. The mirror on the far wall, the antique one with the black iron frame her mom had brought from Rochester, was wrong*.* Not cracked. Not crooked. Just… wrong. The reflection wasn’t her room. It looked like it, but the light was off*.* Dimmer. Colors muted. Her reflection didn’t move with her. And there was someone behind her. Not standing. Not clear. Just… a presence*.* A silhouette made of distortion, like heat above pavement. It pulsed, slowly, like it was breathing. And then it leaned down, almost curious, and whispered in her ear. But it didn’t speak in words. It wasn’t sound. It was understanding*.* A pressure behind her eyes. A rush of ice water through her skull.

She didn’t hear it say “Lacey.”. She just knew it had.

She was outside next, barefoot on the porch, shivering in her sleep shirt. Her breath fogged in front of her as she stared at the Pines, thirty yards off across the dead grass and corn stubble. They moved, but there was no wind. No leaves rustled. Not a whisper. The night was perfectly still, and yet the shadows between the trunks shifted, like a crowd parting. Like something was making room. Her brother would sneak out there. Back when they were both alive. Back when he had something to sneak out to. He wouldn’t be a pussy. He’d be brave. *“Bet you won’t follow me.”* He’d said it with that smug smile. The one she used to hate because it meant trouble, and she followed him anyway because he was her older brother, and he knew the world better than she did. Knew the rules. How to break them. His name was Danny. He died last year. Not in the woods. Not officially. They said it was a car crash, icy roads and bad timing. That’s what the police said. That’s what her father said. That’s what everyone said.

But when they pulled the car out, there was pine pitch on the windshield. And moss in his teeth.

 She stepped off the porch and into the yard. The grass was dead beneath her feet. The sky was moonless. She didn’t remember walking to the treeline. Didn’t remember crossing the ditch or the old cattle fence or the burned patch of field where nothing ever grew. She just remembered the cold. And the smell. The Pines smelled like nothing like negative space. Like absence*.* Her foot hovered at the threshold, just before the forest floor.

And then she heard it:

**Laughter.**

Childlike. Thin. Just out of sync with time and lightly distorted. Like someone was quickly trying to replicate children's laughter from memory and gave up halfway through. Then footsteps. Running, not toward her. Away*.* Like something small and barefoot was tearing through the underbrush, desperate to flee. And then, in the space it left behind, came something else. It didn’t walk. It didn’t crawl. It didn’t move at all, and yet it arrived.

There was a hole in the woods now. Not a tunnel. Not a shape. Just an absence like the air had been scooped out and something else had filled the space. She couldn’t look at it. Not directly. But she felt it. The way a bird might feel a storm. She thought of Danny then, not the way he looked in the casket, but the way he looked in the woods, the last time she saw him. The look on his face when he turned around.

That scream*.* Silent. Trapped behind his teeth.

She turned and ran.

There was the lake, she ran on top of the lapping water for several steps before gazing back at the woods, they seemed to part to form… is that an eye? No… NO! Voices, voices, voices, before she looks to the water and eventually falls in. 

Lacey felt water, intense water. Lacey woke up choking. Not gasping, *choking.*",1,1749720371.0,u_External-Onion-6341,0,1.0,False

We are meeting in few days for a coffee. When we were making plans she said, more or less, that she is free whenever it works for me. 

She strated being more engaged on social media (liking stories / old pictures).

We didn't talk about the reason for coffee, but she knows how I feel (two weeks ago I sent her a letter which you can as a post here).

I don't know if this is a mistake? Maybe I should have kept moving forward. We will see. Good thing is that I'm emotionaly stable now and I feel like I can handle this.

In a way i feel bad that I didn't do this while in the relationship - but on other hand i feel like it was impossible for me to make such drastic changes without the breakup to act as a powerful catalyst.

Pada tahun 2024, Azli ,owner kepada X Cafe (bukan nama sebenar) sewa kedai di shop lot parents saya dan tidak bayar sewa selama 8 bulan. setiap bulan sewa rm1000. Kedai ini jugak mempunyai tunggakan bil elektrik sebanyak rm2000-3000 dan sentiasa berdepan dengan potongan bil elektrik. 

Pada awal tahun 2025,  Azli beritahu dia sudah hendak berhenti menyewa dan menyerahkan shop lot ini kepada sepupu dia, dan segala tunggakan rm8000 dia akan jelaskan secara ansuran, dan penyewa baru (dikatakan sepupu dia) akan menyewa di shop lot itu, dan takperlu bayar deposit baru.

setelah berbincang, kerana kesian, kami memberi diskaun hutang menjadi rm5000. Azli berjaya bayar rm2000 dan baki masih ada rm3000, dan masih tak bayar sehingga sekarang.

saya pergi contact sepupu beliau (owner baru) dan rupanya mendapat tahu, dia sebenarnya bukan sepupunya, tapi hanyalah regular customer Azli dahulu, dan rupanya dia ni bagitau, yang tunggakan bil elektrik still tertunggak dan agak marah kerana dia kena bayar tunggakan elektrik tersebut.

sekarang setelah stalk Azli ni, Azli sedang buat catering coffee, dan dalam sebulan dua ni , agak bagus sambutan dari tempahan kenduri kahwin dan sebagainya. Catering coffee ni seperti apam balik kat kenduri kahwin, tuan kenduri akan deal utk serve X amount of coffee dan akan bayar a good amount of coffee for that day.

1l9hvgb,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/1l9hvgb/hhi_score_they_are_missing_something/,HHI score - they are missing something.,"For those who do not know what HHI score is:

HHI (Herfindahl-Hirschman Index) in crypto measures how concentrated a cryptocurrency’s supply or market share is.  
A higher score means more centralization; a lower score means more decentralization. So basically, the lower the better.

You know for example, you often see these list on ct comparing them. 

It's funny because none of them shared Kendu, which has a HHI score of 28.65. Which is as we saw before very good. 

And on top of that very good HHI score, Kendu isn't a shiny new thing that will only last a few days. Kendu is a 1+ year old project with an insane die-hard relentless community who is working hard to make it a success. It's a permissionless a brand where community-as-a-service is its scaling utility. There exists a symbiotic relationship between Kendu holders and builders building under its umbrella, each spread marketing and brand awareness for the other. The holders provide customers and users to the builders, the builders provide permanent and infinitely scalable brand awareness for the holders. The voluntary culture is to give back to the project if you are profiting from it. Kendu has brought crypto to life, and life to those in crypto. It's an exceptional project the likes of which doesn't exist and hasn't been attempted.

Kendu is the Impossible made possible.  
And You are the secret ingredient.

Chart is primed for a new ath. A major redistribution has happened, all the strong hands and believers are accumulating right now. Platforms like Stocktwits take notice of our hard work and determination to succeed. It's all about the community. There is no second best in this space. Choose the role you want to play in the rise of the leading multi-billion dollar permissionless brand and join the most dedicated, skilled, and connected community in the industry.

We have:

\- KenduGames, an indie Web2 gaming studio with ex-Bioware and AAA game devs.  
\- Kendu energy, an energy drinks brand with new flavours being explored.  
\- Kendu Coffee, Kendu's own speciality coffee roast.  
\- Kendu Vendu, vending machines with AI, soon to launch and enable the community to invest in Kendu - Vendu machines in their localities.  
\- KenduStreet led by StaySeaArt, one of the two Shib Subreddit mods (500k+ people), expert muralist and event organiser.

\- Kendu eSports, hot dogs, vapes, plushies, chocolates, vodka, sweets, jewelry, merch, and so much more...

Don't be surprised when you see Kendu at a multi-billion dollar valuation. Don't be surprised when you see it go into the 10s of billions and higher, either. It will be a household name, and you'll remember reading this message and either listening or not.

Kendu is inevitable.

1l9huu7,https://www.reddit.com/r/breakingbad/comments/1l9huu7/how_walt_and_gus_could_have_peacefully_solved_the/,How Walt and Gus could have peacefully solved the Gale/Jesse/Walt conundrum,"So Walt didn't really like working with Gale because 1. He was worried that Jesse was being turned against him in his time away from Walt, and wanted to keep a pulse on where Jesse's head was at and make sure that Jesse wouldn't give the OK to get rid of him. 2. He didn't like that Gale was perfect; he liked having Jesse around because he enjoyed having an apprentice/master relationship that he didn't have with Gale. When Jesse fucked something up, he could feel superior by telling him ""Idiot. THIS is how you do things, not that way"". When Jesse later did things correctly, he could tell himself ""Look how far I've brought this amateur junkie -- I'm a genius to have turned this methhead into a respectable lab-worthy chemist"". This is why he tried to find ANYTHING wrong with what Gale did (almost nothing) and landed on some temperature fuckup (and it's never stated but I'm pretty Gale didn't fuck up -- Walt just lied and said he did because he wanted to tell somebody ""No, you did this incorrectly, here, I'll do it correctly because I'm better than you""). 
3. He didn't like Gale's meek personality. When Gale was hounded by Walt for his supposed fuckup, he looked like a puppydog that shit on the carpet. Jesse didn't take Walt's beratement like an abused housewife -- if it were Jesse in that situation, Walt can be an asshole to him, and Jesse would just shrug it off and go ""Yeah well bite me dickwad. Maybe you fucked up by..putting it too close to the heat source!!"". Walt *clearly* loves this dynamic, the fact that Jesse has an ego and is willing to fight back, even when he's undoubtedly wrong, endears him to Walt because he sees somebody who has confidence and pride like he does himself. He sees another man in the game. Another strong male ego to contend with and ultimately always come out on top of. Walt doesn't get any satisfaction from kicking a foster kitten, but he sure loves winning an arm wrestling contest against a worthy (but not equal) opponent. That's what Walt wants in his partner  -- somebody extremely capable, still prone to errors, but with enough of a backbone to challenge Walt in a moment of tension so that Walt can beat an opponent who at least put up a fight.
4. Walt and Jesse just have a ""flow"" that's come from working together in shit conditions for so long -- the kind of flow he'd never have with Gale, who never had to rough it in the RV for 4 days at a time without proper equipment. Working with somebody in total dogshit circumstances gives you the kind of collaborative creativity that Gale wouldn't inherit if he was Walt's assistant for a year in the superlab.
5. I still don't really see Gale fully filling the ""Jesse"" roles in the superlab. Jesse was the forklift, scrub shit with his hands, get dirty if he needed to, guy. I doubt Gale can drive a forklift or handscrub a massive vat for an hour without needing a tea or ayahuasca break.

But anyways, what I think they should have done (had this been real life and not a TV show that requires conflict), should have been Walt talking to Gus saying ""Hey. Look. I'm dying. For now, have me, and Gale, and Jesse here. Me and Jesse will teach Gale how we do things, and then when I'm gone, you can have Jesse there to be the expert in the je ne sais quois of how I like to do things, the minor tweaks that book learning can't teach that only me and Jesse know, and Gale to be the expert in chemistry and booksmarts and be that Jesse doesn't know. Let all 3 of us work together, build rapport, and then when I'm gone Jesse can maintain the artistry of my recipe while Gale can ensure the chemistry is kept sound.""

This would be, in my view, a win for Walt and Jesse, a win for Gus, and *definitely* a win for Gale

Pros: 1. Avoids pretty much all bloodshed: Jesse and Walt remain close so they can both stay confident the other will veto any sort of killing of the other one. Walt can constantly check Jesse's temperature regarding the situation, and doesn't feel the need to do crazy shit to save his life. Gale is kept sidelined and belittled enough to never feel fully confident in taking the lab over entirely; he probably will dislike Jesse at first but after a while and with Walt being there to bridge the culture shock between the two I'm sure Gale could eventually be convinced that without Walt there, Jesse's experience, instincts, and..interesting thought processes are something that's necessary to maintain the quality of the product and to want to keep Jesse as an assistant/partner in a post-Walt world. 

2. Jesse really never wanted to be ""a guy with a gun"" -- I think all the bloodshed he saw as one of Gus's henchmen while Mike was putting him thru his working rehab was a huge factor to his complete mental breakdown later in the show (not to mention he'd never have to kill Gale....). Maybe when Walt retires/dies of cancer, Jesse starts to feel a sense growth and accomplishment in how far he's come when Gale, an extremely qualified chemist, earnestly asks him advice when something starts going wrong with one of the cooks and he knows what to do due to his experience. 

3. Walt and Jesse end up going to basically a regular dayjob. I'm sure after a while without any bloodshed or mis, Walt could convince Skyler to chill out a bit and that he basically just works in a lab again. Yeah it's a highly illegal lab, but it's insulated enough from the street he might as well be working for Grey Matter again. Jesse finds stability in having a 9-5 and not seeing people get their heads blown off/doesn't get into firefights or shoot people. This is the pro column so I'll say he stays clean and doesn't act out, uses his fixed schedule and insane income to build a home for/with Angela and Brock and basically lives a normal life except he gets to retire with tens of millions at like 27.

4. Gus doesn't have to slit that dude's throat and he goes to Mexico instead of Jesse -- I'm sure Victor, a hardened henchman, would have been at LEAST as useful as Jesse was in Mexico, and all things considered Gus's trip to Mexico went as perfectly as one could hope with Jesse. Victor never gets sacrificed as a ""Fine. You win. You two are the cooks. Now get the fuck to work and *no.* *more.* ***problems.***"" message from Gus to Walt and Jesse, and I always liked Victor :(. Maybe he's more on the ball and Mike doesn't get shot, idk, I can't see how he wouldn't be an improvement over Jesse but I also can't really see how the mission could have gone better than it did. Plus with Victor still in the picture, that's one more highly qualified guy Gus can use to motivate Walt to play nice, work out his contract, and die happy he's the last person in his lineage who will ever have needed to work for a living.

5. Walt gets the best of both worlds when it comes to assistants, his ego basically getting felated and rimmed 24/7. He gets the meticulous, detail-obsessed smartypants that shows up early, makes him the perfect coffee every morning, marvels at his genius each day, shines his shoes (and hopefully that's all...), and gives Walt the feeling of being in charge of a professional laboratory with very highly qualified and trained chemists and he also gets his Stand and Deliver moments with Jesse where he can berrate the class clown, have his appetite for conflict sated, and then jerk himself off if Jesse ever occasionally outperforms Gale, proving to Walt how much of a genius he is that he could turn lowlife dropout Jesse into such a competent lab technician/assistant in the amount of time he has that he's surpassed a person with Gale's education and background. Could be a con because he could literally explode from how inflated his ego might become.

Cons: 1. Walt and/or Jesse (lets be real tho it'd be Walt) may never feel at ease with Gale being alive, and with three people doing what was a two man job, Walt (due to his ego and the fact that he's the one closest to retirement) may never feel truly safe unless Gale and/or Gus is in the ground. While I truly believe that Victor's murder was a message from Gus to Walt saying ""You win, asshole. You have the job for as long as you want it. I will not try to harm you or Jesse. I will not try to replace you. **Get the fuck to work, now.**."", Walt clearly never understood that, much later asking Jesse ""what was that even all about?? like wtf he just wanted to scare us?! what a psycho!!"". He may feel the need to take out Gale and/or Gus before he retires/becomes too ill to work.

2. Walt and/or Jesse would have to take a major pay cut. Jesse convincingly estimates that for every 3 million dollars that him and Walt are paid each paid, Gus brings in 96 million dollars in revenue. A third cook at the same rate brings his employee costs just for the meth lab up from 6.25% of his total earnings to 9.375%, which may be too high for him to stomach considering that would be basically 10% of his revenue going to 3 dudes out of an organization that seemed to employ multiple hundreds if not close to a thousand people. I know a ~3% increase
might not sound like a lot, but that's 3% of his money before any other expenses, and a covert business like his might have a profit margin of less than 3% altogether. I think at this point in the show Walter would take a paycut to make it work (when Jesse confronts Walt about the disparity, he just says ""Jesse, you are now a *millionaire*. And you're complaining?) but I don't know if Jesse would want to split their salary, and I definitely don't think Walt would like earning less than Gale. I think he'd swallow his pride here and be able to tell himself ""i mean 1.5 million ..... is still ...... fuck it who cares what Gale makes."". . Maybe an agreement could be reached that they all make 2 million this contract, and then whenever Walt decides to step away Gale and Jesse bump up to 3 million. 

3. Maybe Jesse gets bored again, and feeling taken advantage of and still not understanding that Gus probably spends at least 90% of that 96 million dollars per his 3 on other business expenses (and not maturing being forced to get sober and sit in the car with Mike) starts skimming meth and selling it on the side again. I think if this happened with Walt still on board, Walt would just make Gale do the final packaging, and if it were post-Walt then Jesse would probably get one single warning of ""We're paying you well, and this slap on the wrist is a courtesy. Steal from us again and you're not waking up tomorrow"". From here ... who knows. Maybe Jesse gets himself killed, and Walt (alive but retired) is called back by Gus to work with Gale again, and realizing Jesse is dead Walt goes on a paranoid warpath and blows up Gus's organization anyways, while Gale struggles to handle the lab on his own.

Anyways this got WAYYY longer than I meant it to don't blame anyone for not reading all or any of it but the tl;dr is: 

Walt should've proposed to Gus to split Walt and Jesse's salary 3 ways with Gale, have the 3 of them work together with the understanding that Walt would only be there until the end of his contract or Maybe another 6 months afterwards, at which point Jesse and Gale would run the lab with their full pay. Lets Walt keep an eye on Jesse and Gale and stay in Jesse's ear to keep Jesse on his side. Gives Walt his ideal social setting for work. Keeps Jesse out of harms way. Keeps everybody alive.",2,1749719619.0,breakingbad,2,1.0,False

Context: A guy has been hyper vigelent of me, he is always staring and blushing. He comes up to me and then runs away. Others have commented on his attention.

His family visited from perth, they knew who i was before i knew who they were (easy to idnetify his twin brother tho). His brother basically interviewed me. We fought to answer ask questions and he laugjed with his head back like the guy i like does. He told me his twin was single and that he had been watching his brother and i together. Turns out we have the same world views, like country music and the country, surfing and have both travelled for work. This guy i like turns up at the end, hugs me when he finds out my Grandma just passed. I give him a little rub back. And tells me he will check up on me next week after the funeral. He hands me my cardigan likes its something prescious and blushes. His family who ride in his car let us go ahead by ourselves. 

The next week I'm numb with grief and this guy i like seeks me out, he asks me all these questions but i find it so hard to connect because I've just buried my Grandma and havent had more then 3 hrs sleep (havent been able to eat either :( ). 

He runs out on our convo to talk to someone then goes and sits in his car even though he said he would come back. I go to him because i dont want to wait. We talk a bit. He says he has buried someone he loves too, but doenst elaborate when i ask.
He asks after my days off. He says he will spend time ith me next saturday having coffee. He remembers where i live and will come to my suburb and we can get coffee there together. He then tells me on the one day his family was up from perth they went to all the places I reccomended to his siblings.
He tells me we are complimentary in our approach to work and he is glad about that.
He walks me to my car, telling me he will have to remember where i park and what my car looks like. and carries my stuff to the car and hugs me.

The next day he cancels the date. Saying he is busy and he liked talking to me but he has 'stuff to get through'. 
He ignores my question to reschedule just dodges it and says he is bad at texting.

Next week he sits behind me again. Watches me with my friends. Walks his friend out, sits in the car, then turns it off, comes right in, makes a beeline for me like a terminator. I catch him staring at me as he zooms towards me and he diverts. I call out and invite him into the group and he joins, chats, briefly mentions he hopes i have a nice few days off (remebered a small detail from last week). And then goes to leave. I walk him out and he offers to hold my stuff gain, and insisits. He tells me he had a relaxed week (which contridicts his busy week excuse for cancelling). He apologies for swearing to me with over exagerated body language (idm srsly if he knew what i did for work). Tells me he had a habit of being on his phone too much growing up so turns his phone off (which is fine tbh, im the same). And tells me he loves how pasionate i am about what i do. He seems really pleased abt my plans for the rest of the night and encourages me abt them. 
Since then hes been VERY active on messenger which contradicts his prior statement to me and still has nkt viewed my past message.

Why did he pull back? But then come back?

Was he scared off by my grief?


He said he knew what it was like to loose family, surely he knows i wasnt me that night we were alone after my Grandma's funeral and didn't attribute my grief to who I am compared to usual happy self he knew me, and enjoyed me as, before she passed..",1,1749719395.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

If you're on the hunt for the perfect home setup, searching  the best espresso machine 2025, Reddit is a great place to start. By tapping into the latest Reddit threads, you'll get a clearer idea of which machines are worth your investment in 2025, so we spent the past few months deep in espresso rabbit holes trying to find the perfect machine for home use. After testing 7 of the most hyped-up espresso machines in 2025 (from Breville to Gaggia to more niche brands), figured we’d share what was discovered and what’s worth the money, what’s not, and what we wish we knew earlier.

Full disclosure some espresso machines are not recently tested and we based our review on the past results of these espresso machines.

We have the best in two categories of espresso

1. Best espresso machines under 300 (for the budget buyers who want the value and less of all the technicality)
2. Best espresso machines for prosumer and entry-level prosumers.

**7 Best Espresso machines under 300 for 2025**

1. [Breville Bambino](https://intoptrend.com/best-espresso-machine-under-300/#breville-bambino) \- This is a versatile option for budget and for prosumer beginners who are just starting their espresso game. This is the most value pick in our list if your budget is restricted and you want to a beginner friendly espresso machine.
2. [Delonghi Dedica Mastero](https://intoptrend.com/best-espresso-machine-under-300/#dedica-maestro) \- The Dedica Maestro Plus suits beginners seeking ease with room to grow, this is essentially due to auto milk frothing and shot control. Compared to the Breville Bambino, the Dedica offers more programmability and a stylish design, though it lacks a hot water spout. Ideal for evolving home baristas.
3. [Delonghi ECP3420](https://intoptrend.com/best-espresso-machine-under-300/#delonghi-ecp3420) \- The De'Longhi ECP3420, a manual boiler machine, offers better temperature stability and richer shots than the slimmer, automated Dedica Maestro with its thermoblock. Though less automated, the ECP3420 excels in modding potential and advanced use, making it ideal for espresso enthusiasts seeking quality extractions in a compact, affordable package.
4. [Flair Pro 3](https://intoptrend.com/best-espresso-machine-under-300/#flair-pro-3) \- The Flair Pro 3 is a solid upgrade with the new preheat funnel, shot mirror, better build, and nicer case. Still fully manual, so it’s for folks who love dialing in every shot. Not as quick or easy as something like the Breville Bambino, but way more satisfying if you’re into the process.
5. [ROK Espresso maker](https://intoptrend.com/best-espresso-machine-under-300/#rok-espresso-maker) \- The ROK is compact, affordable, and fun, but needs careful preheating and is less precise. The Flair Pro 3 costs more, but offers better temperature control, pressure feedback, and build quality. Choose the ROK for simplicity and speed; choose the Flair for serious, consistent espresso with manual precision.
6. [Wacaco Picopresso](https://intoptrend.com/best-espresso-machine-under-300/#wacaco-picopresso) \- The Wacaco Picopresso is a legit, travel-sized espresso maker that delivers true café-quality shots with rich crema. It’s fully manual, compact, and well-built, but needs good puck prep, a quality grinder, and hot water. Perfect for coffee nerds on the go—portable, fun to use, and easy to clean.
7. [Nespresso Vertuo](https://intoptrend.com/best-espresso-machine-under-300/#nespresso-vertuo) \- For the user’s who just wants to press and forget. Not the ideal espresso, but excellent choice for convenience.

 **7 Best espresso machines for prosumer and entry-level prosumer**

1. [Rancilio Silvia Pro X](https://intoptrend.com/best-espresso-machine-for-home/#rancilio-silvia-pro-x) \- High price, for recommended for prosumer use. Delivers excellent espresso.
2. [Ascaso Steel Duo](https://intoptrend.com/best-espresso-machine-for-home/#ascaso-steel-duo) \- Much like the Rancilio Pro X, with a high price tag recommended for prosumer use.
3. [Rancilio Silvia](https://intoptrend.com/best-espresso-machine-for-home/#rancilio-silvia) \- Recommended for everyone, beginners who like for their espresso journey to begin close to commercial grade coffee. Buying a used machine would further reduce your budget. This a one of the best value picks in the picks.
4. [Gaggia Classic Pro](https://intoptrend.com/best-espresso-machine-for-home/#gaggia-classic-pro) \- Again, recommended for anyone who wants to start getting into espresso process. Modding provides value and better output as well.
5. [Breville Bambino Plus](https://intoptrend.com/best-espresso-machine-for-home/#breville-bambino) \- Best of both worlds in terms of budget and good quality espresso making. Recommended machine for starters and for convinience seekers.
6. [Breville Barista Pro](https://intoptrend.com/best-espresso-machine-for-home/#breville-barista-pro) \- A smart all-in-one machine with a fast heating system and built-in grinder. Intuitive interface and easy workflow make it a great upgrade for everyday users
7. [Breville Barista Express](https://intoptrend.com/best-espresso-machine-for-home/#breville-barista-express) \- Still one of the most popular beginner machines. Built-in grinder and solid performance, though a bit dated compared to newer options. A good place to start if you're just getting into espresso. (built -in grinder significantly does a good job)

**What are the essential things to consider before buying?**

When purchasing a home espresso machine, key factors to consider include your **budget**, **counter space**, and **coffee consumption habits**. Prioritize investing in a **high-quality grinder**, as it has a greater impact on flavor than the machine itself, flat burr grinders are ideal for consistent, fine grinds. Choose between **single boiler**, **dual boiler**, or **heat exchanger** machines based on how often you brew and what drinks you prefer; single boilers suit occasional use and straight espresso, while dual boilers handle higher volumes and milk-based drinks better. Lastly, compare your current coffee spending to the investment and spending more upfront on quality gear can save money long-term.",2,1749719349.0,consumerconcern,0,1.0,False

China’s youth unemployment crisis has fuelled a boom in ‘fake offices’. With joblessness among 16 to 24-year-olds surpassing 16% in 2024, many now pay for desks, Wi-Fi, and even pretend managers in staged workplaces to preserve routines and avoid social stigma.

Every morning, thousands of young people across China get dressed for work—not to earn a wage, but to preserve the illusion of employment.

In major cities, a growing number of unemployed youth are paying daily fees to simulate office life.
As youth unemployment soars past 16%, many recent graduates find themselves stuck in what state media terms an “employment ice age”.

In Beijing and Shanghai, makeshift workspaces offer the illusion of employment.
For as little as RMB 30 to 50 yuan (approximately S$5.35 to S$9), users gain access to an office desk, Wi-Fi, coffee, and sometimes even lunch.

Some packages include additional services like staged photo ops, or fake managers who provide “supervision”.

## Questions for the Community:

1. **Anyone else crash and burn from severe restriction?** How did you recover?
1. **Best high-calorie keto foods** to reach calorie goals without going over carbs?
1. **How long did your keto flu last** when you did it right vs. wrong?
1. **PCOS ketoers** - any specific advice for hormone balance?

**Feeling much better on Day 8!** Energy is back, hunger is normal, and I’m finally eating like a human instead of a crash dieter 😅
However, I am scared what if I have gained weight ? I would bail out then so I’m not weighing our measuring myself (I did on day 6).

Thanks for reading this novel! This community has saved my sanity 💪

Set to enter into force at the end of the year, the EU's regulation on Deforestation Free Products (EUDR) is set to impact a lot of businesses in and outside the EU. Any operators bringing products derived from Cattle, Cocoa, Coffee, Oil Palm, Rubber, Soy, and Timber, need to supply a due diligence statement that shows their product didn't contribute to deforestation.


I'm interested in finding out from producers, traders, and wholesalers whether you've already started collecting data for the EUDR's due diligence requirements and if so how it's going... Or even if you haven't heard about it at all really. Anything helps.

I mostly like it but I've had some awful customers and a few were because of family stuff.

For some context. My mom was married and divorced before she met my dad. She has my half sister (27) and my half brother (25) with her ex-husband. Then she has me and my brother (15) with dad. For as long as I can remember my mom's ex has been pretty awful to mom, dad me and my brother. My mom left him because he was like that when she was pregnant with my half brother and she couldn't let it continue. I know before she even met our dad she had a temporary protection order against him because he wouldn't leave her alone during their divorce and would show up everywhere she was. The protection order expired and he didn't follow her around like that anymore but when my half siblings were younger there was always third party exchanges done so mom and their dad wouldn't meet face to face.

It didn't stop us all being at the same place when my siblings had games or shows where family typically shows up for support. Their dad was always hostile and if his family were there it was always the same. Eventually mom and dad decided it wasn't the right place for me and my brother when the hostility was aimed at us too.

My half siblings always kinda took their dad's side. Even when security got involved a couple of times once at my half brother's high school graduation and the second time at my half sister's college graduation. Their dad had to be removed but they took his side.

When I started my job their dad, grandma and uncle would show up and they were rude and pretty nasty to me. Think of those videos people make go viral with crazy behavior. That was the kind of thing I experienced. Their dad called me a b\*itch and an ugly looking r\*tard. Their grandma yelled at me from out of nowhere and it never made sense what she was yelling about and tried to report me to my boss because she didn't like that I was there. Their uncle would call my mom names to my face and tell me I took after her. This stuff happened multiple times before they were banned from the coffee shop where I work. But then the owner changed a couple of months ago and they have been allowed in again and they treat me like shit still.

My mom and dad didn't like how I was being treated and my mom went to her ex and told him to stop bullying me because I did nothing wrong. She told him that they should all be ashamed of how they were treating me. It was a whole thing and did nothing. Mom even went to the cops with me to see if they'd do anything but no. My half siblings defended their family when they found out. They were even annoyed mom would defend me and said so what when reminded of how their dad, grandma and uncle treated me. They told us they didn't care and they easily said their family would do the same to my brother if he were in my place.

It hurt a lot and made me realize they don't give a single fuck about us. I always kinda knew but that was a whole other level. And because of this, my half brother's wedding in August is something I don't want to attend. My parents understand. My grandparents (mom's parents) do not. They told me not to let mistakes made when we're all young ruin a relationship between us. But, I mean, it's pretty obvious my half siblings don't care about us or see us as family so why should I go. My grandparents are pretty upset about me not wanting to go. My parents talked to them but it's still there.

I am absolutely in love with coffee and enjoy testing various speciality coffee places when I visit new cities.

Recently I've moved within my city and am further away from good coffee shops, which made desire to buy myself a espresso machine myself even greater again.

For as long as I can rememember I always thought about getting a Breville Express ... well, since that is what 90% of people reommend as a starter.

Over the recent years, however, I got less budget constraint (thanks to finishing my studies) and am in a position where I really don't mind spending a few hundred euros more for a utility piece I plan to own for years to come.

**The problem: now the never-ending rat race starts:**

* It starts off with thinking ""well wouldn't it make sense to add 400-500 EUR to my budget to just make sure I get the right machine + grinder"" ... \*proceeds checking available options\*
* It then moves on to finding a potentially suitable candidate (e.g., profitec go) in a slightly higher price range
* And all in a sudden crashes down by googling ""machine XYZ + reddit"" and spinning thoughts of ""well if I now already spend 1,100 on my setup, wouldn't it make sense to spend 300 more to get this machine which can do this and that"" because all the people on reddit say this machine is so much better than the other one

I am always in some sort of decision paralysis because I want to buy the right machine and everytime I am about to pull the trigger I delay my decision out of fear of buying the wrong machine.

So I am trying to get tangible advice:

\> if I am trying to allocate 1-2k for a decent espresso machine + Grindr, are there any grave mistakes I can make by going for machines in that range?

\> and if so: would you rather say stay within the lower range and test the water because the marginal utility of each EUR spend more in that range will not make that much of a difference for a beginner?",2,1749718490.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

My husband and I ended up in a bind - he lost his job and couldn't find another (lay offs and unemployment rate is a serious problem right now in Canada), and we decided to relocate to live with his parents abroad for a better life because the future isn't looking so bright in Canada. I know staying with his parents is only temporary until we get on our feet and can move into our own place, but I wasn't expecting it to be as difficult as it's turning out to be. I have met his parents and stayed with them before and have had no issues, but I guess it's different when you live with someone. 

First things first, his dad walks around in his underwear 24/7. I understand it's his home and he wants to feel comfortable, and I am not about to tell him how to dress in his own home, but I would be lying if I said I didn't find this strange. It makes me feel deeply uncomfortable. Furthermore, people in this country tend to greet one another by kissing each other on the cheek. I can't even tell you how uncomfortable I feel every day when he greets me whilst in his underwear. I'm from a similar culture but this is not something my dad or anyone in my family would ever EVER do. 

His mom is a whole other story. I left my home, family, friends and everything I knew in Canada, and hoped his mom would be a source of comfort and support. Boy was I wrong. When I first arrived, I went into the kitchen hoping we could have a cup of coffee together and connect. Instead of offering me anything, she stood there for over an hour talking and talking (while saying nothing of any substance) and I could feel the anxiety growing in my chest at how overwhelmed she was making me feel. You also can never get a word in, because it is obvious she isn't listening to a word you try to say and will interrupt you within seconds. It is SO stressful to be around her and I've realized by this point that that's just how she is. I'm a very empathetic, introspective person, so her personality type is nightmarish to me. You cannot have a calm interaction with her, she is always flying off the rails and worked up about something or another. She's also never ONCE asked me since I got here how I'm doing or how I'm feeling, even though she knows I'm going through a hard time. I don't think she's uncaring, she just has no idea how to be emotionally present. And it's suffocating. 

Both his parents are also obsessed with talking about beautiful women to my husband and I which I find SO WEIRD. We can never sit with them without hearing ""wow did you see this woman or that woman,"" his mom once even went into detail about a woman she used to know who was the most beautiful woman she'd ever seen and gone into all the details of what this woman's body looked like and what she wore to bed. While my husband was sitting there beside me. I could feel nothing but discomfort growing inside but I just have to sit there until she finally shuts her mouth which takes forever and a day. It seems to be all about superficiality with her.

I feel guilty for even feeling these things because they have been so generous to us while we've been here and I do appreciate that, but I also can't help that I don't like them for things mentioned above and can't wait to be away from them. Am I wrong for feeling this way? Can anyone else relate? 

It's really unfortunate because I'm having such a hard time adjusting to a new country and their behavior only makes me feel more isolated and alone. It's starting to affect my mental health and I no longer feel like myself anymore :'(",2,1749718470.0,inlaws,2,1.0,False

I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection and engagement with another person.

I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul. All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you?

I'm 34, male, and live in the US (Michigan).

*I strive to engage in genuine and thoughtful discussion.* I seek people who generally know themselves and what they desire from and offer another. Being lost together is fun, but we each need a self to become lost. There's more than deliberate engagement and a handful of interests to what makes someone up, from mundane chatter to intense distress. Honestly striving to embrace and integrate the more grueling aspects of existence in a considerate way, while not being totally lost to them, is an attractive ideal of mine. I want people who show up as their real, authentic, messy selves, with a gaze that's elevated towards something majestic.

*Being high in abstraction, sensation, and an ability to experience things beyond the material is essential for me.* I want people with a vibrant imagination that are high in cognitive splendor. People who are genuinely weird and different are inherently interesting to me. I long for someone who can mirror me back, but sometimes a person with a wholly different perspective and axiom can see and mesh with you best. I peak with ideation and whimsy, desiring compatibility over a clone, and seek out others who do as well.

*Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.* I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics, which is inscribed onto one of the plaques I've placed above my abode in the Epistemic Wilderness. What does that mean? I deem nothing to be above reproach, and have actively sought out the most peculiar and obscure bits of knowledge possible since I was young. I seek peers in this and related endeavors.

*Creativity and artistry are important to me, and I appreciate and admire many different types and expressions of it.* Personally, I engage in more literary arts, in which I primarily write about my observations, thoughts, and lived experiences. I also adore writing conversationally, from chats to lengthy letters, and am not uncommonly poetic and intense when doing so. Photography also has a hold on me, and I hope to do more than just dabble in it as time goes on.

*More casual and practical hobbies of mine include incense, time pieces, archiving, organization, collecting, and coffee.* Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here.

*I'm INTJ, Type 5, score very high in openness and conscientiousness, and am a Virgo.* I list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find most of these sorts of metrics and tests to be largely bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people and have since I was young. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

Are we looking for each other? Are we capable of more in life from having met than never having crossed paths? Chat me up. Leave your hesitations and take the chance.

So I've been seeing a lot of chatter about the **Coffee Loophole Recipe For Weight Loss** lately, and as someone who's tried basically every coffee hack under the sun, I figured I'd share my honest experience with this one. I'm not going to lie - I was pretty skeptical when I first heard about it because, let's face it, we've all been burned by ""miracle"" weight loss tricks before.

But here's the thing: this approach actually makes sense from a metabolic standpoint. Instead of relying on caffeine crashes and jitters, the **Coffee Loophole Recipe For Weight Loss** works with your body's natural fat-burning processes. I've been using it for about six weeks now, and the steady energy and appetite control have been genuinely impressive.

What really caught my attention was how this method focuses on optimizing coffee's natural compounds rather than just loading it up with random supplements. There's actual science behind why certain combinations work synergistically to support weight management.

👉 *Curious to try this at home? Here's the full recipe:* [https://www.amgroyal.com/coffee-loophole-recipe-for-weight-loss/](https://www.amgroyal.com/coffee-loophole-recipe-for-weight-loss/)

**Quality Ingredients Make All the Difference**

This is where I initially went wrong, and I see a lot of people making the same mistake. I thought I could just use my regular grocery store coffee and throw in whatever ingredients I had lying around. Big mistake.

The **Coffee Loophole Recipe For Weight Loss** really depends on using high-quality, organic coffee beans. The difference isn't just about taste - it's about the concentration of beneficial compounds like chlorogenic acids that actually support metabolism. Cheap, over-roasted coffee loses most of these valuable elements.

I switched to a medium-roast, single-origin coffee and immediately noticed the difference. Not just in flavor, but in how my body responded. The energy felt cleaner and more sustained, without the usual crash that comes with lower-quality beans.

The same principle applies to the other ingredients in the recipe. Fresh, organic components work together in ways that processed alternatives simply can't match. It's like the difference between cooking with fresh herbs versus those dusty ones that have been sitting in your spice rack for two years.

**The Texture Secret That Changes Everything**

Here's something most people don't realize about the **Coffee Loophole Recipe For Weight Loss**: getting the texture right is absolutely crucial for both effectiveness and enjoyment. I spent way too many mornings drinking what basically tasted like coffee-flavored medicine before I figured this out.

When prepared correctly, this recipe creates this incredibly smooth, almost creamy consistency that's actually pleasant to drink. It shouldn't be gritty, oily, or harsh - there's a specific technique that brings all the ingredients together into something that genuinely tastes good.

Temperature control is huge here too. Too hot and you'll destroy some of the delicate compounds; too cool and everything won't blend properly. There's a sweet spot that maximizes both the flavor and the bioavailability of all the beneficial ingredients.

The timing of when you add each component also matters more than I initially thought. The **Coffee Loophole Recipe For Weight Loss** isn't just about throwing everything together - there's an order and method that creates the perfect final product.

**The Cultural Background That Actually Makes Sense**

What I found really fascinating is that this approach has roots in traditional coffee preparation methods from various cultures that have understood coffee's medicinal properties for centuries. Ethiopian coffee ceremonies, Turkish coffee traditions, and even some South American preparation methods all recognize that coffee can be more than just a morning pick-me-up.

Many of these traditional approaches focused on maximizing coffee's natural compounds for health benefits, including weight management and metabolic support. The **Coffee Loophole Recipe For Weight Loss** essentially takes these time-tested principles and combines them with modern nutritional science.

It's pretty cool to think that what we're ""discovering"" now about coffee's potential for supporting healthy weight loss has been known and practiced by different cultures for generations. We're just finally understanding the science behind why these methods work.

**My Personal Journey With This Recipe**

I'll be completely honest - the first few days were nothing special. I didn't feel dramatically different, and I was starting to think this was just another overhyped coffee trend. But I decided to stick with it for at least a month because I'd already invested in the ingredients.

Around day 8, something shifted. My usual mid-morning hunger pangs just... weren't there. I found myself naturally eating smaller portions at lunch without feeling deprived. My energy levels stayed consistent throughout the day instead of the usual roller coaster.

By week three, I was genuinely impressed. The **Coffee Loophole Recipe For Weight Loss** had somehow regulated my appetite in a way that felt completely natural. I wasn't forcing myself to eat less - I just naturally wanted less food.

**Important Things to Keep in Mind**

While this approach has worked really well for me, I want to emphasize that everyone's body is different. What I love about the **Coffee Loophole Recipe For Weight Loss** is that it's not about dramatic restrictions or unrealistic expectations - it's about optimizing something you're probably already doing anyway.

Start slowly if you decide to try it. Your digestive system needs time to adjust to any new routine, especially one that involves changing your morning ritual. Pay attention to how your body responds and adjust accordingly.

The recipe itself is surprisingly simple once you understand the principles, but the details really matter. Cutting corners with ingredient quality or preparation method will likely leave you disappointed with the results.

* Use freshly ground, high-quality coffee beans
* Pay attention to water temperature and timing
* Don't skip steps in the preparation process
* Be consistent with your morning routine

Has anyone else experimented with this approach? I'd love to hear about your experiences and any modifications you've found that work well. Coffee culture is all about sharing what works, right?",1,1749718310.0,yummyrecipesyum,0,1.0,False

I even shared with her how it’s hard for me to make friends and why it’s hard. Jess completely understood and shared with me that she’s the same way but could see us becoming very close friends and so could I. One day Jess and I happened to have break at the same time and decided we wanted to grab coffee at the cafe across from our work together. Because why the heck not, It was one of those days where two cups were needed. Our breaks are only a half hour long so instead of walking around the building we decided to cut through some classrooms to use an exit that is directly across from the cafe to save time. One of those classrooms ended up being Sarah’s. While opening the classroom door Jess and I were venting about some crazy stuff that happened in our classroom not noticing that Sarah was standing less than 10 feet away. When I went to say hello to Sarah she cut me off by yelling “really”. She then went off yelling saying that we were supposed to be best friends and as soon as I moved classrooms it was like she didn’t matter anymore. But it’s fine just keep talking to your new friend. 
I was stunned I didn’t even know what to say so I smiled and tried to laugh it off because I wasn’t about to make a sense in front of small children like she just did. I told Sarah that I would talk to her tonight and she replied with a whatever. Jess and I continued to walk through her classroom to the next room. I apologized to Jess stating that I’m not sure what that was but I know it’s serious. Jess then looked me dead in the face and said to me “ if that was my friend I would dump her so fast and that she doesn’t do that jealousy shit, no thank you”. Remember this it’s very important. I just replied with a no and I’d figure it out later. That night Sarah and I talked at length about how she felt she lost her best friend and how it hurts that I’ve found someone else to connect to. Sarah even went on saying that she’s happy that I’m making other friends and she doesn’t want me to feel like she has to be my only friend but don't forget that she’s still here. I explained that there was nothing to worry about and that she’s still my best friend. I apologized for making her feel that way and how it wasn’t my intention and all I was trying to do was make another friend. I stated to Sarah that I would pull back a little with my friendship with Jess and make sure I did daily checks in with her if I didn’t see her at work. Sarah agreed and our friendship continued like normal. I talked to Jess about the incident with Sarah and explained that she was just feeling insecure about our friendship and let those feelings get the best of her. Jess still held fast to her earlier statement about not doing the jealousy thing in friendships. Which is fine like I get it but I don’t have a lot of friends and didn’t want to lose that friendship. Jess was fine with that and our friendship continued as normal just not as close. I didn’t think much into it because heading into the holidays work and life got super busy. I didn’t have the chance to hang with either Sarah or Jess during this time. Sarah and I talked regularly outside of work. Jess and I talked off and on outside of work. Fast forward again to February of 2025 when I noticed that Sarah was coming over to my classroom more often to talk to Jess. I being me got excited thinking we all could be friends.  In March a teacher was let go and classrooms needed to be amended to cover the loss of that teacher. Students and teachers got moved around into new classrooms. I being one of those teachers got a new classroom with the same students. This classroom was closer to Sarah’s which we were psyched for. We got to see and talk to each other more. After the move into the new classroom, I started to notice that Jess and I weren’t talking as much and I played it off as we weren’t near each other anymore. Until I noticed that Jess would walk into Sarah’s room often and ignore me completely. I found this off but was like whatever if it was important they’d like me in. This continued for a while. In May I had serious dental surgery done and that’s when I noticed that not one of them reached out to check on me until days after. Both of their messages were very brief and very similar. Just the basic “hey just checking in how’d it go”. I ended up having to take a few more days off due to having some issues and neither of them reached out to me. Once I got back to work and was very self-conscious about my new teeth Sarah and Jess went out of their way to tell me that I looked weird, talked funny, and laughed in my face. I was hurt they were supposed to be my friends and they ganged up on me. They could have said it differently or even more kindly, but nope. After that, I decided that I needed to take a break from both of them because in my book true friends don’t treat each other like that knowing that this was something I was very self-conscious about. After pulling back on my friendship with both of them, I really got the eye-opener. Was I stupid not to see it sooner? Did Sarah want me to pull back on my friendship with Jess so that she could befriend Jess and not me? Does Sarah only want me to herself and only be friends with her? Was Jess lying about her earlier statement about jealousy and friendships? If Jess knew Sarah was like that why pursue a friendship with Sarah? So I guess what I’m asking is would I be the ahole if I just cut off my friendship with Sarah? I’m too old and too tired to be dealing with childish games of who can’t be friends with whom. I just want a friend who can open up to, be raw with, and not be judged by which I feel is neither of them. 

So AITS for giving up/ throwing away our friendship?

Any tips on how to live with a friend that annoys the absolute shit out of me? 

We have very different ways we go about life. They’re pretty shallow and can be inconsiderate. They don’t do anything ‘just because’, like if a cup is left on the coffee table, it stays there until I put it up near the sink. They don’t offer to make tea or a serve of food they made. These are all things
I do that I just consider being kind. And I just don’t think they’re kind, they’re only nice. 


They don’t take the bins out, they don’t clean properly and I feel like a shit person being around them because I get so annoyed by them. 

They’re really social and literally always talking about themselves, even first thing in the morning. I don’t want to talk first thing in the morning, or just because I’m in the same room as them. I’ve brought this up so many times and it keeps happening. 

I’ve discussed all of this with them and it’s not changing (house stuff that is - not that we’re incompatible) 

Personality wise, they base a lot around validation and their job title  and it’s frustrating hearing about their dating life because they don’t think anything through and repeatedly don’t learn from mistakes. I also find them to be judgemental of other people in a different position from themselves or people who have different interests. 

It just feels like they have absolutely zero common sense and they don’t think things through, then anxiously spiral about their decision. 

I’ve stopped opening up to them and it’s become a one sided friendship. I don’t really want to spend any more time with them than I have to, and they cannot offer comfort or advice because their brain is just wired so differently to mine. 

They’re nice to see on occasion. I just don’t know why I chose to live with them.

I was dreaming that I was back in my old bedroom at my parents’ house, but the room had turned into a small swimming pool. I was swimming when, all of a sudden, I felt this strong urge to go downstairs and find my mom.

When I got downstairs, there she was, standing in the other room, in front of a mirror. I asked her for a hug, and when she hugged me, it was strong and full of emotion. It felt like a goodbye hug.

I asked her if she knew that she had passed away on March 2nd. She said she did, and she looked heartbroken that she had to leave my dad, my sister, and me behind.

I then asked if she had felt her passing, and she said yes. She told me she definitely felt it, but it happened quickly and she didn’t suffer.

She also told me she can hear me when I talk to her, and she encouraged me to keep doing it because it makes her happy.

Then, she drew a tarot card for me, but I can’t remember which one it was. Still, to me, that moment felt like another sign that she truly hears me when I speak to her.

Since she passed, I’ve created a little ritual: I chat with my mom every morning while I drink my coffee. When I’m done, I ask if she has a message for me. I pull a tarot card, and every single time, the message feels like a direct response to what I shared with her.

Her visit was brief, but it brought me so much comfort. I’m just so happy I got to talk to her.

### Introduction: The Digital Nomad Revolution

The world’s gone rogue. Cubicles are empty. Boardrooms echo. The digital nomad movement isn’t a trend—it’s a tectonic shift. You’re not just working from a beach; you’re rewriting the rules of work and life. Who orchestrated this rebellion? People like you. Restless. Ambitious. Unwilling to settle for fluorescent lights and stale coffee.

### The Seismic Shift in Work Culture

Work used to mean a desk, a clock, a boss breathing down your neck. Now? It’s a laptop, a passport, and Wi-Fi that sometimes works better in Bali than in Boston. The old system is cracking. You’re the aftershock.

*🌎 Curious how much you could earn as a digital nomad? [Find out instantly with this free tool!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)*

### Freedom of Location

The cubicle was a cage. Digital nomadism is the key. Suddenly, geography is a playground. You’re not stuck in one place—you’re everywhere. Wake up in Lisbon, sleep in Chiang Mai, dream in Medellín.

#### Living Where Others Vacation

Why wait for two weeks of vacation? Flip the script. Make paradise your backyard. The world is your neighborhood, and every sunrise is a new address.

### Flexible Work Hours

Time isn’t your enemy anymore. It’s your accomplice. Work when you want. Sleep when you need. No more clock-watching. You set the tempo. The 9-to-5? That’s someone else’s problem.

#### Redefining the 9-to-5

Meetings at midnight. Deadlines at dawn. Your schedule, your rules. You’re not chained to a routine—you’re the clockmaker.

*⏳ Ready to see your nomad earning power? [Unlock your potential in 90 seconds!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)*

### Diverse Income Streams

You’re not betting on one horse. You’ve got a stable. Freelance gigs, remote contracts, side hustles, passive income. Multiple currencies, one wallet. The world pays you now.

#### Freelance, Remote, and Entrepreneurial Pursuits

From coding to coaching, design to dropshipping—your skills are borderless. Launch a business from a hammock. Pitch clients over coconut water. The hustle never sleeps, and neither do you.

### Cultural Immersion

Tourists skim the surface. You dive deep. Living like a local isn’t a tagline—it’s your reality. You learn the secret handshakes, the unspoken rules. Every city, a new classroom.

#### Language as a Secret Handshake

Language opens doors. You’re not just learning new words; you’re decoding cultures. Each phrase, a password. Each accent, a badge of honor.

*🌍 Want to know if you’re leaving money on the table? [Diagnose your digital nomad income potential now!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)*

### Personal Growth and Reinvention

The road is a mirror. You see yourself—raw, unfiltered. Reinvention isn’t optional; it’s inevitable. You adapt, evolve, and emerge unrecognizable to your old self.

#### Adapting to the Unpredictable

Plans dissolve. Flights get canceled. Wi-Fi dies at the worst moment. You improvise. You thrive in chaos. Flexibility isn’t a skill—it’s survival.

### Networking Without Borders

Your network isn’t limited by zip code. It’s global, sprawling, electric. Collaborate with a coder in Berlin, a marketer in Manila, a designer in Cape Town. Borders are for maps, not minds.

#### Collaborating Across Continents

Projects span time zones. Ideas travel faster than planes. You’re building alliances, not just contacts.

*💡 Wondering if your skills can fund your freedom? [Test your digital nomad earning potential—free!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)*

### Cost of Living Arbitrage

Earn in dollars. Spend in pesos, baht, or rupees. Suddenly, your money stretches. Five-star lifestyle, two-star budget. The system wasn’t built for this. Too bad for the system.

#### Luxury on a Shoestring

Private villas, rooftop pools, gourmet street food. You’re living large—without the price tag. Arbitrage isn’t just for Wall Street.

### Minimalism and Mobility

You carry your life in a backpack. Possessions trimmed to the essentials. Experiences, not things, weigh you down. You’re lighter, faster, freer.

#### Prioritizing Experiences Over Possessions

No more storage units. No more clutter. Every item earns its place. Memories, not merchandise, fill your world.

### Work-Life Integration

Work and life aren’t rivals—they’re dance partners. You blend deadlines with downtime. Yoga at sunrise, emails at sunset. Balance isn’t a buzzword; it’s your baseline.

#### Wellness on Your Own Terms

You choose your rituals. Meditation in Morocco. Surfing in Sri Lanka. Wellness isn’t scheduled—it’s woven in.

### Escaping Bureaucracy

Red tape? You cut through it. Visas, taxes, paperwork—navigated with cunning. The system tries to slow you down. You find the loopholes, the hacks, the shortcuts.

#### Visas, Taxes, and the Digital Hustle

You master the art of the visa run. You optimize your taxes. You play the game—and sometimes, you change the rules.

*🌐 Ready to break free? [Diagnose your digital nomad income potential now!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)*

### Access to Global Opportunities

Your market isn’t local—it’s planetary. You tap into opportunities from every corner. The world is hiring, and you’re first in line.

#### The Rise of Borderless Entrepreneurship

Startups without headquarters. Teams without borders. You’re not just working remotely—you’re building empires.

### Learning Through Adventure

Every day is a lesson. You learn from tuk-tuk drivers, street vendors, expats, and strangers. The world is your university. Tuition: curiosity.

#### Street Smarts, Not Just Book Smarts

You negotiate in night markets. You navigate unfamiliar streets. You solve problems textbooks never imagined.

*🚀 Want to know your digital nomad income potential? [Diagnose it in under 90 seconds—free!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)*

### Building Resilience

Comfort zones are for the complacent. You’re tested, stretched, sometimes broken. But you rebuild—stronger, sharper, unbreakable.

#### Turning Setbacks Into Stepping Stones

Missed flights, lost luggage, language barriers. Each setback is a lesson. Each lesson, a stepping stone.

### Creating a Personal Brand

You’re not just a worker—you’re a story. Every destination, every challenge, every win becomes part of your brand. You leverage the exotic. You turn your journey into influence.

#### Leveraging the Exotic for Influence

Your Instagram isn’t just pretty pictures—it’s proof. Proof that you’re living differently. Proof that the old rules don’t apply.

*🌎 Curious how much you could earn as a digital nomad? [Find out instantly with this free tool!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)*

### Environmental Awareness

Travel isn’t just about taking—it’s about giving back. You choose eco-friendly options. You respect local customs. You leave lighter footprints.

#### Conscious Travel Choices

You offset your flights. You support local businesses. You travel with intention, not just impulse.

### Family and Relationships on the Move

You’re not alone. Some bring partners, kids, pets. You raise third-culture kids—global citizens. Love doesn’t wait for a permanent address.

#### Love in Transit

Relationships are tested. Some thrive, some fade. But every connection is real, raw, unfiltered.

### Challenging the Status Quo

You question everything. Why work in one place? Why settle for less? You’re the architect of your life. The status quo is just a suggestion.

#### Becoming the Architect of Your Life

You design your days. You build your reality. You refuse to play by someone else’s rules.

*⏳ Ready to see your nomad earning power? [Unlock your potential in 90 seconds!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)*

### The Downsides and Dilemmas

It’s not all sunsets and smoothies. Loneliness creeps in. Instability gnaws. Burnout lurks. The dark side is real—but so is your grit.

#### Navigating the Dark Side

You find community. You build routines. You confront the shadows and keep moving.

### The Future of Digital Nomadism

The movement is just beginning. Tech evolves. Borders blur. The next frontier? Unwritten. Will the system catch up, or will you always be one step ahead?

#### Trends, Tech, and the Next Frontier

AI, automation, new visas, remote-first companies. The world bends to the nomad’s will. The revolution continues.

# Decoding The New Homes Security Landscape

Security Guide Now that it’s 2025, it should come as no surprise that the threat of home invasion has never been more prevalent. Cha...The sad truth is you’re no longer safe in your own home. Developed relationships, technological advancements and crime trends have dictated a shift in how we view the protection of our homes.

Today, [home security](https://www.yalehome.com/ae/en/products/alarms-surveillance) is no longer simply about having a locking door — it’s about establishing an environs of security that responds to a world in flux.

# 1. Urbanisation and the Growth of Cities

A higher percentage of the population lives in cities than ever before, creating denser neighborhoods and busier public spaces. WINTER: So, you know, you have all these different people kind of together and you have burglaries, you have package theft and you have crimes against property that naturally kind of go up.  
A good home security system serves as a vital buffer — a line of defense that provides surveillance, deterrence and peace of mind against crime, terror and other hazards in areas where one’s personal space is greatly welcomed.  
🔹 **Insight:** Research indicates homes that have visible security equipment, such as cameras or alarms, are 300% less likely to be burglarized.

# 2. E-Commerce and Deliveries Are on the Rise

The rise of online shopping has made doorstep deliveries part of everyday life. But this has also created new areas for theft. Porch piracy — stealing packages left at the doorstep — has spiked in recent years.  
That’s where smart alarms, cameras and motion detection come in, to help keep those risky deliveries safe. Implementing contemporary home security measures can greatly lower the risk of losing lucrative shipments.

# 3. Remote and home-working lifestyles

Our homes have a new role in the post-shelter-in-place world. Homes are more than places to live — they are where most people have set up their offices, classrooms and entertainment centers. This shift makes it more important than ever to maintain safe homes.  
Smart-[home security](https://www.yalehome.com/ae/en/products/alarms-surveillance) systems let people keep an eye on their homes while they’re working from a coffee shop or traveling out of the country. Live feeds and instant alerts can be used for immediate action based on any doubtful activity.

# 4. Sophisticated Threats Against New Age Home Security Solutions

Digital theft is a growing problem, as well, as thieves use the internet to access smart home products. Homes adapting to a world of digital dangers are now adding cybersecurity to their profile of security concerns.  
Securing, encrypting systems, keeping the software up-to-date are as important as locks and alarms. Security And the need for security, especially as it relates to personal data and household privacy, will require a layered security approach.

# 5. A Little Bit of Comfort in a Big, Scary World

If you’re prepared for the next unexpected twist, you’ll be better equipped to keep yourself, your things and your family safe. events running through our heads or in the front of our newspapers confirm for us that uncertainty is a part of life. Having complete and thorough home security is not only to protect items, but also for feeling secure.

1l9hei8,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_cristostone21/comments/1l9hei8/heres_why_more_bangalore_homes_are_choosing/,Here’s Why More Bangalore Homes Are Choosing Quartz Countertops,"If you’ve recently stepped into a newly designed kitchen in Bangalore, chances are you’ve seen a stunning quartz countertop—sleek, modern, and built to last. Over the past few years, quartz has quietly taken over as the top choice for homeowners and interior designers alike. But why?

At Cristo Stone, we’ve worked with hundreds of families and contractors across the city. Based on what we’ve seen firsthand, here’s exactly why quartz is becoming the go-to material in Bangalore homes.

# 1. Low Maintenance = Less Headache

In a fast-paced city like Bangalore, people don’t have time to constantly clean or reseal their countertops. That’s where quartz shines—literally and practically.

Unlike granite or marble, quartz doesn’t need sealing. It’s non-porous, which means it won’t absorb spills or stains. Wipe it once, and it’s clean. Whether it’s morning coffee or your child’s science project gone wrong—quartz can handle it.

# 2. Modern Looks That Fit Any Home

Quartz comes in a wide variety of patterns and colours—from clean whites and bold blacks to natural stone looks that mimic marble. No matter your home’s style—contemporary, classic, or somewhere in between—there’s a quartz design that fits perfectly.

In fact, many Bangalore architects we work with now prefer quartz because it blends beauty with practicality.

# 3. Built for Bangalore’s Climate

Let’s be honest—our city’s weather can be unpredictable. One day it’s dry, the next it’s humid. Quartz doesn’t mind. It’s resistant to heat, moisture, and everyday wear and tear, which makes it perfect for Bangalore kitchens, especially in apartments where space is tight and surfaces are heavily used.

# 4. More Hygienic, Especially for Families

Because quartz is non-porous, bacteria and germs don’t seep in like they can with natural stone. That’s a big deal, especially if you have kids or elderly family members at home. Add in the fact that it’s easy to clean—and it’s a win for hygiene.

# 5. Long-Term Value

Sure, quartz may cost a bit more upfront than some other options—but it pays off in the long run. You’re not spending on polish, resealing, or replacements every few years. It’s a smart, long-term investment in your home’s value and beauty.

# Final Thoughts

At Cristo Stone, we’ve seen the shift happen up close: more and more Bangaloreans are moving towards quartz because it just makes sense—visually, practically, and financially.

# Canine Camaraderie

I had a surprisingly fun day at the local park today. I’ll often take my dog Porter there after work with my ChuckIt stick to hurl tennis balls across the grass field. I was taking him to the proper dog park but had to stop. My loveable mutt, a mix of Pit Bull, German Shepherd, Rottweiler, Boxer, Pekingese, Collie, and Supermutt (yes that’s a thing where there’s trace elements of too many breeds to classify) is a crafty 55-pound cardio monster. Definitely has strong alpha bro energy. He’s got that body builder Boxer chest and Boxer brown coat along with boundless Pit Bull energy, Collie/German Shepherd smarts and loyalty, and that loveable Rottweiler smile and workhorse mentality (sprinkle in some Pekingese zaniness as well.) When he’s off-leash he knows he’s unstoppable and has punked me multiple times. I’ve spent hours trying to wrangle him when he’s off-leash while he gleefully elides me with effortless ease.

After having learned my lesson more than once, I’ve resorted to keeping his leash on while playing fetch with him. It looks weird and is maybe slightly uncomfortable for him, but the local park is not an off-leash dog park so at least I have a plausible reason for keeping his leash on.

Anyways, while launching tennis balls and listening to podcasts on my Airpods a rather cute girl and her sheep dog came strolling by. After making eye contact, she asked if her dog Rocky could play with Porter. Of course I agreed, quickly yanked out my headphones, and we struck up a friendly conversation. Soon, another dog a Golden Doodle named Bernie along with his owners joined us. Then another gal with her corgie Cheeto. And then another poodle mix named Cypress. And then a little white terrier Walter and his parents. And then an enormous Great Dane Bruce. Before long, we had a whole menagerie of canines frolicking and wrestling each other, and we were all yucking it up bragging about and lovingly teasing our respective pups. People passing by thought we regularly gathered in the park it was so natural. It was a beautiful scene.

# Scout and Whipper

Porter wasn’t my first dog or pet. I’ve had him a little over three years now. My first pets were Scout a Queensland healer and Australian Shepherd mix and soon after Whipper a black lab. I believe my family got Scout when I was five. Scout was a great dog, but he was an outside dog. You have to remember in the 90s before everyone was utterly dog crazy, people still kept large dogs outside. As my grandmother would say unless you live in a barn, dogs belong outside.

He was a beautiful dog but had herding tendencies. Unfortunately I hate to admit, he was left outside a lot without attention and when my siblings and I would play with him he would often nip us as is common among sheepdogs especially those without sufficient stimulation. He also was a trench-digging machine given the long stretches of time he spent outside untended and would dig holes a meter deep. If you looked outside, you would often see a mushroom cloud of dust from the dirt he kicked up digging with his paws.

Whipper was a black lab who we initially found wandering the neighborhood. I think we kept her for a few days before eventually my parents found her owners and we found out her name was Ariel at the time. Apparently, they soon afterwards decided to move away from the neighborhood to a residence that didn’t accept dogs (now that I’m older, I’m a little suspect that this was true especially given how long she was away from them while we had her.)

The couple remembered my family caring for Ariel while she was lost to them and proposed that we adopt her given how much my siblings and I liked her. My parents accepted maybe in the hope that it would provide our other dog Scout a companion. We renamed her Whipper which is what we called her when we first found her wandering the neighborhood. Her tail never stopped wagging so Whipper seemed a fitting name.

Relegated to an outside life like Scout, soon the novelty wore off for my siblings and me and we sadly ignored Whipper as well. My dad eventually decided that it would be better to find new homes for them (he was also tired of the massive craters in the backyard and the multiplying mounds of dog crap.) Whipper went to a nice family and Scout went to a farm where he could run and chase animals to his heart’s content.

It saddens me now to think my siblings and I didn’t love them more and give them more attention. I’m glad that they went to better homes.

# Mopsi

When we were a bit older in the year 2000, we started hankering for a new dog. I was twelve at the time. I wanted a Golden Retriever. Who doesn’t love a golden retriever? A classic All-American dog. I remember my younger sister wanted a Norfolk terrier.

At first, we tried going to the local SPCA. We looked at a few dogs there. It even looked like we might adopt a nice chow mix name Chiquita. But she soon showed aggression and may have tried to bite one of us and that was the end of that.

My mom and younger brother ended up carrying the day. We ended up with a pug. We got her from a little farm nearby. We had done a little bit of research on different dog breeds using a CD-ROM (yup you’re reading that correctly) of AKC-recognized dog breeds. There were five pug puppies available. Three males and two females. Now even though I wanted my classic Golden, one could not deny the cuteness of these tiny brachycephalic (aka smashed-face) fawn puppies.

I’ll never forget my mom asking the breeder about the temperaments of the different genders and birth order of the puppies. There was also another couple there at the same time looking to adopt listening to my mom’s invariably astute questions. We had mistakenly assumed that the female pugs would be more friendly and less aggressive (while this is generally true it is not the case with pugs and many other dog breeds.)

Now the runt of the litter was one of the two females. My mom while very insightful but perhaps not politically-savvy asked the breeder if the runts typically had behavioral issues since they’re sometimes bullied by their siblings. Before the breeder had barely finished acknowledging that yes that they sometimes did, the other couple scooped up the older female and signed the adoption papers. We ended up with the runt. Mopsi was what we name her, short for “Mopshondon” which we read in a dog-naming book meant “pug” in German.

Mopsi was a good dog for us in hindsight. Unlike Scout and Whipper, Mopsi was always an inside dog. And true to the breeder’s word, she had the feistiness and spunk of a runt in spades so she could not be ignored. A shameless beggar and vociferous snorter and snorer, she demanded attention especially with her cute little pig-swirl tail and frequent snarls when food was at stake.

She slept in my bed for a time before opting for my sister’s bed in the long run. I was the one that had to walk her though and clean up after her frequent accidents in the house. My sister was too young and my brother fussed and protested too much so that it fell on the shoulders of the eldest son. My grandmother, who was a constant presence at our house, would often walk with me at night to get Mopsi to go to the bathroom. In hindsight, I’m grateful that I got to have those walks with grandma.

I moved out in 2007 for college in LA. My brother moved out a couple years later and my sister followed in my footsteps in 2011. My parents and especially my dad ended up caring for her in old age when she became gray-faced and incontinent and needed more and more vet visits and medication. She was put down in 2014 at the age of 14. I wasn’t there for it. She was old and sick.

# Olive and June Bug

Up until I met Olive and June Bug, I had never really liked or understood the appeal of cats. My neighbor growing up had a cat named Patches who was always very standoffish and grumpy and so I had written off cats entirely that is until I met BB, my future fiancée and the supposed love of my life.

BB and I met at an afterschool tutoring center in Sacramento in December 2014 when I applied for a job there. She was the assistant manager and apparently liked what she saw and helped me get hired. I had applied to the job after quitting a grimy and depressing albeit character-building job at a recycling center weighing people’s cans and bottles and hauling their scrap metal to processing facilities. I was living a sort of hippie life at the time, living cooperatively in a house with twelve other people cooking meals for each other, tending the communal garden, holding collective house meetings and hosting couch surfers and traveling bands, even did Burning Man together.

I invited BB to one of the concerts at the house and things moved quickly from there. I was soon staying at her apartment almost every night with her and her two cats Olive and June Bug. Olive was the slightly older one. A petite tuxedo cat who true to her breed was fussy and at times feisty and quick to bite but also very sweet and gentle once you got to know her. June Bug on the hand was a chonker, a big ol’ loveable tabby/Maine Coon mix who loved nothing more than to make muffins on your chest and snuggle up against you. While Olive made little soft “cacks” and was always a proper lady with good grooming, poise, and posture, June Bug was a feral pig that made all kinds of vocalizations and flopped on the floor like a common hog.

BB’s cats took quickly to me and I to them. I was soon feeding and watching them and even changing their litter box, something I thought was beyond disgusting before (still think is pretty nasty but not as bad as I once did.)

BB and I moved into together after eight months into a small studio apartment. While cramped (we even shared a *twin bed* for a couple months), this was probably the happiest or perhaps the simplest time in our relationship. I remember once in a panic when we first moved in thinking that June Bug had runaway out the apartment door that a maintenance worker had left ajar. After desperately looking around the neighborhood for her, we found her wedged deep behind the dishwasher and the cupboard encasing. She didn’t like strangers.

After a year of living together in the Sacramento studio, BB decided she wanted to move back to San Diego where her family was. I had always dreamed of living in San Diego by the beach and didn’t take much convincing. We quit our jobs at the tutoring center and on a rainy day in October of 2016 we packed our belongings in a U-Haul trailer, corralled and penned the cats in a kennel crate together, and drove through the rain and thunder that night five hundred miles to San Diego. I remember the cats being terrified and fighting so badly with each other we had to separate them and BB had to hold June Bug in her lap for the rest of the drive.

San Diego was as beautiful as I’d dreamed. I’d stayed up 44 hours straight from the time we started packing our stuff in the early morning, to the drive through the night across a torrential downpour throughout California, and to the time we finally unloaded our belongings the rest of the next day and night into a small little second floor studio bungalow a mile from the beach.

San Diego was picturesque but exhausting. BB had had a tutoring center director job lined up beforehand, but I had nothing until I finally landed a job at the Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf as a barista. Tried balancing barista life in the morning with math classes at San Diego City College in the evening to try to get accepted into a master’s program at San Diego State. I was rejected.

Despite the setbacks and caffeine roller-coaster, I loved living by the beach and Mission Bay. Olive and June Bug also liked the San Diego weather and even had a little balcony to sunbathe on. Eventually quit the barista job and followed BB to work at a private school network in San Diego.

Covid happens. Things got hard. BB quit her job at the private school right before lockdown. She then went through a slew of questionable online education gigs.

On a June day in 2021 at the age of fourteen, Olive started behaving bizarrely and lethargically in a way we’d never seen. We took her to the emergency vet. They examined her and filled her with fluids. She got worse. We took her to another vet. Thousands of dollars later the vet said she was dying and it was time. I remember crying like a baby along with BB, not just for Olive but also for the life that we’d all had had together. In hindsight, part of me knew that this passing marked the end not just for Olive but for the idyllic life we’d once shared in San Diego.

# Porter

Life had gotten hard not just because of Covid and Olive’s passing. By 2021, I was in deep denial about the massive red flags in our relationship. BB had had mental health struggles her whole life. She’d gotten into hard drugs at a very early age (meth and heroin at age 12. San Diego is full of money and drugs and a culture all too ready to supply them to young women.) BB would disappear from home for days at a time. Her clueless and desperate parents decided the best thing to do was to have her abducted in the middle of the night and sent to a drug rehabilitation center in Mexico. She would frequently describe the abuse and horrible conditions there. Stress positions, endless positivity tapes, spoiled food, molestation.

She’d also been 5150’d (i.e. institutionalized for 72 hours on emergency psychiatric grounds that you pose a danger to yourself.) In 2018, she had a total mental breakdown when a family of the private school network we worked at threatened to sue her for trying to expel their demonic child who had threatened to shoot up the school and promised to see the other kids in hell (the school executives showed how stiff their spines were when they threw BB under the bus and allowed the kid to simply transfer schools.) I chased her threw the streets of Sacramento as she tried to throw herself into traffic.

There were other incidents. Multiple times she got into fights with her friends and became so hysterical that she would lock herself in the bathroom and I would have to drive her friend home. Another time she got into such a blowout fight with a different friend on the floor of a casino, that even the dead-eyed casino attendees circled around them and watched in astonishment. We never saw that friend again.

Despite all of this, I proposed to her in August 2021. We’d made it through Covid together. Everyone else didn’t understand her brilliance. They were jealous of how brightly her star shone.

Everything changed in January 2022. After an abortive last minute ski trip to Big Bear New Years Day where we sat in traffic all day and night and completed all of two runs down the mountain (largely due to how pissed BB was even though it was her idea), we were lounging on the couch one night a couple days later. I was watching TV, she was asleep.

All of a sudden, BB roused herself from a dream and blurted out, “I f\*\*ked Eddie.”

At first I couldn’t believe what she said. “What did you say?”

“I don’t know.”

“You said you f\*\*ked Eddie!”

Who was Eddie? Eddie was a coworker of hers, her assistant director as a matter of fact. Apparently, on a corporate retreat in April 2018 nearly four years before this accidental admission they had hooked up at a hotel they were staying at courtesy of the private school.

I was distraught. Said it was over. She pleaded with me. It only happened once. She stopped in the middle of the act. Said she couldn’t go through with it. She loved Lee! We were engaged.

One week later we adopted Porter. The next best thing to getting pregnant to salvage a doomed relationship is to get a dog. Porter is proof that beautiful things can come from ugly beginnings.

# Epilogue

Porter was and is an amazing dog. Got him from a guy in the Navy that got deployed last minute to Japan. For all of BB’s flaws, I always admired how quickly she could recover and take action.

We tried to move forward. Rebuild a life with our new pup. Took Porter to the dog beach in San Diego. Took Porter on hikes. Took Porter with us to visit my parents in Sacramento.

It was too late though. The wedding planning stalled. BB was too busy with her new job she just got. Tried to forge ahead with a September 2023 wedding date. BB decided she needed a summer hall pass before the wedding. Ran the hall pass four times. Continued seeing one of the guys. Even bought his plane ticket to fly him across the country from Philadelphia the weekend of my bachelor party.

One night in September, I pack up everything I can fit in my car and leave Porter and BB behind and drive 500 miles up I-5 and show up unannounced at my parents’ doorstep.

BB is aghast and in disbelief at first. Soon reconciles herself to the situation. Decides she wants to move across the country to Philadelphia to be with her new lover.

I agree to drive back down and fetch Porter before she leaves. I drive down. Before she flies away, we connect one last time.

Her dad and I start packing and moving the remaining things. Two days later I get a call. It’s BB. Philadelphia isn’t working out. The new lover kicked her out. She needs to come back to San Diego.

She flies back to San Diego. BB and I return to the home by the sea we’d built and cherished together for seven years. We connect a few more times. She asks if we could somehow fix it all. I lie. I use her body.

Two days later, I leave San Diego with Porter. I never see her again.",1,1749717640.0,heartbreak,0,1.0,False

1l9h9gc,https://www.reddit.com/r/applesucks/comments/1l9h9gc/iphone_photo_transfer_rant/,iPhone Photo Transfer (RANT),"Ok, I left the apple ecosystem a while ago. Long story short I ended up with an iPhone 16 that I got thru a family member and decided to use it for a month-long trip because it’s battery life and cameras were better than my zflip 5(I love that thing but the technology isn’t there just yet). 

So I go on the trip and take a bunch of photos and videos and now, want to move them to my PC. I knew it would be difficult, but turns out it’s borderline impossible. I tried using Microsoft’s photo’s app which has an automatic import feature that “works” with iPhones- I was pleasantly surprised. All looked well until I took a closer look at the imported photos-over half of them didn’t transfer over properly and had these grey bars that covered 45% of the photos. Tried again, same issue. On top of that, I forgot apple has their own proprietary video format, MOV. So any videos I was able to transfer over, are unplayable in windows…

My next plan was to use my mom’s MacBook and use the image capture app to transfer over to Mac, make any needed file conversions there, and then archive the files on my PC. Easy right? Nope. I plug it in, and start the transfer, not even halfway thru, the transfer fails? Why? IDFK..It says that the phone became disconnected. Ok? Maybe it’s the cable? Switched out the cable-same problem. I tried a different port-same problem. How the fuck is apple’s own software and hardware not working together? Beats me. I’m convinced that apple is staffed entirely of Giraffes with the sheer amount of oversight there is.

I waved my white flag and conceded to using the “photos” app (which I despise) to import everything. Yeah it would take longer to archive, exporting it out of the app in small batches, but at least I would be able to get the photos off the iPhone…..lol no. 

I open up the photos app and hit “Import all”. Now, if you were anything like me, you’d think that meant your entire library- and you’d be wrong. For some reason, 300ish photos and videos were not importing. Every time I’d try import the remaining items, the phone just disconnects and the import doesn’t happen. So, I try going 1 item at a time. And that worked, then 10 items, then 20. All that worked well, until I got to another batch of 20 that didn’t import. So again, I go one by one, and it turns out that there is 1 single video, that just doesn’t want to import. 1 single fucking video somehow prevented the import of over 300 photos and videos. It’s Giraffes all the way down. Ultimately, I gave up once I imported everything else and even airdropping that last video wouldn’t work.

Compare that to my android, I just pop it in my pc, drag the DCIM folder over, let it copy for 45 mins, and enjoy a cup of coffee. Or, better yet, plug an external drive DIRECTLY into the phone and transfer files that way. AND ALL THE FILES TRANSFER OVER. I tried that with the iPhone and it didn’t work (what a surprise).

It’s incredible, apple forces you into preforming a certain operation the way they want you to by making all other options nearly impossible. And even when you concede and do it their way, it still doesn’t fucking work.

Now you may be asking me, why don’t I use the cloud? Because I hate the cloud. I dont want my files in the cloud, I want them on my fucking computer. Is that self-sabotage and does that make me stupid and stubborn? Maybe? But I’m not one to shy away from self-deprecating insult tee ball. 

It was nice to FaceTime people and send text messages on my iPad, but I’m absolutely done with iPhone. I wish I could say I’m done with Apple as a whole, but I’m in the market for a new laptop and unfortunately, most of the windows laptops available right now are hot doodoo on a stick. At least apple is capable of making a laptop that can get more than 3 hours of battery life (those m-series chips are great, gotta give where credit is due). I don’t hate macOS as much as IOS, so I think I’ll be ok. If I have to ever import any photos from my Android, just move it to an external drive first, and then the MacBook.

Anyways, rant over. Overall experience is negative 4 out of 20. If any apple devs are reading this, get your heads out of your asses, and make products that work you fucking Giraffes…",1,1749717159.0,applesucks,8,0.6,False

I used a frozen stainless steel ball (the kind used for chilling drinks) during the brew to help preserve flavor and reduce oxidation. On top of that, I pre-chilled my server in the freezer. I brewed 15g of coffee with 150g of water, and after the press, I added 80–100g of ice directly.

The coffee came out warm—not hot—thanks to the frozen server and steel ball, and the result was a really clean, unique cup. You could argue it's a bit of an overcomplicated process, but honestly, it’s worth trying at least once. If you’re into experimenting with your setup, give it a go.

Chapter 1

Third Person's POV

""Ma'am, your husband has cheated on you. The divorce agreement in your hand is real, and there is no agreed time for remarriage. As long as you file it, you can actually complete the divorce process. If you don't want a divorce, I can help you revoke this document.""

""No, just file it for me. When can the divorce process be completed?""

""Three days later.""

Clarissa sat in a cafe with the lawyer, recalling what happened yesterday.

“Mrs. Daniel, your husband’s frozen sperm, stored here at the hospital, was taken five years ago. It was donated to Ms. Gabrielle Hawkins. Didn’t he tell you?”

Clarissa Daniel’s smile froze the second she heard that name. For a moment, she thought she’d misheard and asked again in an unsteady voice, “Is it possible there was a mistake? My husband’s name is Norris Daniel.”

The doctor tapped the keyboard a few more times, double-checking. Then he looked up and said firmly, “There’s no mistake. I can still remember, when Ms. Hawkins gave birth, Mr. Daniel even sent a thank-you banner to the hospital.”

The words hit her like a blow. Her hand, resting on the wheelchair arm, slipped off, powerless, then a buzzing filled her ears.

Five years ago, she and Norris got married.

Back then, he’d told her he didn’t want her to suffer through childbirth, and had volunteered to get a vasectomy. She’d been so touched by his thoughtfulness back then.

Still, fearing he might regret it one day, she insisted he freeze some sperm first, just in case.

Lately, He was under great pressure from his parents. In order to help him share the pain, she also wanted to have a child of their [own.So](http://own.So), she came to the hospital on her own, planning to surprise him with a pregnancy.

But instead, he’d surprised her first.

And the name Gabrielle chilled her to the bone.

Gabrielle was the older girl from next door, whom Norris had secretly loved for fifteen years. He’d planned a grand confession before she went overseas, only to be flat-out rejected.

It was during that heartbreak that Clarissa stayed by his side, warming him with her sunny optimism. Eventually, they got married.

She truly believed he’d moved on, that he’d fallen in love with her.

Now she realized he never had. He never let go of Gabrielle. Clarissa was just the consolation prize in a sad little game she played with herself.

The doctor noticed the sudden change in her complexion and asked a few concerned questions.

Clarissa forced a smile. “I’m fine,” she murmured, wheeling herself out of the hospital and heading home.

Still in a daze, she pushed the door open, assuming the place was empty, until the faint clinking of glasses reached her from the balcony.

“Norris, are you really going through with the divorce? Clarissa’s been with you for five years. Don’t you love her even a little?”

Norris’s voice was lazy, almost indifferent as he replied, “When Gabrielle needed me to get married for the sake of her stability, I agreed. But now she doesn’t need that anymore. And I don’t want to keep Clarissa tied to me out of guilt. That’s the only reason I married her in the first place.”

The voice on the balcony paused, then asked again, more seriously, “Does Clarissa know you and Gabrielle have a child together? She loves you so much. If you really divorce her, I bet she’ll disappear without a trace. You’ll never find her again.”

Norris chuckled. “She doesn’t need to know about the kid. A few days ago, I told her the company’s in trouble and that we needed to fake a divorce. Once she gets used to the idea, I’ll tell her the truth. She’ll understand. Besides, look at her legs. Where can she even go?”

Clarissa felt like her brain had exploded.

'A fake divorce?' The words echoed in her head.

She had believed him, believed the crisis was real. She even gave him the last of her dowry savings to help him through it.

But it was all a lie.

A choked sob rose in her throat, and her chest tightened as if pierced by needles.

She had been planning a future with him, thinking about surprising him on their anniversary.

But he had already erased her from his plans. Guilt was all it took to sum up her ten-year crush and five-year marriage.

She thought she had finally won his heart. Turned out, she was just a placeholder in his love story with someone else.

Looking down at her lifeless legs and remembering the pain she endured to save him, she realized how foolish she’d been.

Instantly, grief turned into rage.

Clarissa suddenly started pounding her legs with her fists, tears splashing onto her thighs, hot and unstoppable.

Suddenly, the voices on the balcony fell silent.

Clarissa froze. She hadn’t meant for them to hear. Panicking, she turned the wheelchair and headed for the front door.

A moment later, Norris came over. His expression flickered with surprise, and his voice dripped with false concern.

“Clarissa, when did you get back? You should’ve called, I’d have come to get you. What did the doctor say?”

She looked at his eyes full of love, but then her eyes welled up again.

Alarmed, Norris reached out, trying to wipe away her tears. “What’s wrong? It’s okay. If you don’t get better, I’ll take care of you forever.”

Clarissa stared into his eyes again, trying to find even a shred of real affection in his eyes. But in the end, she couldn’t bear to know and looked away.

Sniffling softly, she casually asked, “Norris, I’ve been thinking… I’d really like to have a child with you. It’s a good thing we froze some sperm back then. Do you think you can come with me to the hospital sometime soon?”

Upon hearing that, his face changed instantly. He avoided eye contact and mumbled something, clearly trying to change the subject.

“Why bring that up all of a sudden? I don’t want you to suffer through pregnancy. I’d feel awful. Besides, didn’t we agree to travel the world together? Hard to do that with a baby.”

Seeing how uncomfortable he looked, Clarissa closed her eyes. She had her answer.

She slumped slightly in her chair and said, “I’m tired. Can you carry me to the bedroom?”

He nodded and helped her inside. Once he was gone, Clarissa reached for her phone.

“Auntie,” she said quietly, “I’ve made up my mind. I want to go to the Netherlands with you.”

Her aunt's excited voice came through the speaker, but the joy didn’t last long.

“This time… how long are you planning to stay? Don’t tell me you’ll come running back after two days because you miss your husband again.”

Clarissa’s heart clenched. She whispered, “Permanently.”

There was a pause on the other end. Then her aunt’s voice came back, warm and full of resolve. “Okay, then. I’ll start the immigration paperwork.”

After hanging up, Clarissa made another call. But at that time, to her lawyer.

She was done waiting.

Her love couldn’t warm a heart that never opened to her. If Norris wanted a real divorce, then she’d give him exactly what he wanted.

She would turn this fake divorce into a real one and make his lies come true.

End of memories.

Once Clarissa made up her mind to leave Norris for good, she didn’t waste any time. Ahe met with a lawyer to sort through their shared assets and financials.

By the time she was ready to head home, a sudden downpour had started. However, she hadn’t brought a driver today and had just hailed a cab to the quiet little coffee shop where she met her lawyer. Now, with the heavy rain coming down in sheets and barely a car in sight, Clarissa found herself stuck.

She’d wait under the awning for the rain to pass and kindly refused her offer to help.

Hours passed, but the rain didn’t let up. It only grew heavier as the sky turned from gray to pitch-black. As such, her legs, still recovering, began to ache. With no other option, she finally pulled out her phone and called him.

“Norris,” she said softly, “can you come pick me up?”

The urgency in his voice was immediate. He barely got out a few words before hanging up, promising he was on his way.

That call sparked a small warmth in her chest.

Maybe he still cared. Maybe not everything between them was a lie. Could she give him one last chance?

But just as he turned the corner from his street, Norris’s phone buzzed with a message that froze him in place.

\[Gabrielle: Norris, I’m back.\]

His heart skipped a beat. Without hesitation, he pulled over, sent a quick message to his driver, and spun the car around. The tires screeched as he sped off, heading straight for the airport.

Back in the rain, Clarissa sat in her wheelchair, rehearsing in her mind what she would say to him. She’d tell him about her fears, her confusion, the aching need to believe they could still make this work.

But night fell, the storm quieted to a drizzle, and rain pooled around the base of her wheels, yet Norris never came.

Her heart sank deeper and deeper, until it felt like it had hit rock bottom.

She called him again, but there was no answer. Still, she tried again, and finally, someone picked up. But it wasn’t him.

A woman’s voice, soft, almost pleading, echoed from the other end.

“Norris, do you really not love me anymore?”

After a brief silence came Norris’s voice, low and tight with emotion.

“Gabrielle... I’m married now.”

The woman didn’t back down and asked, “But you still came for me, didn’t you? Then tell me, why would you leave your wife, who’s only five kilometers away, just to drive thirty kilometers to pick me up?”

Clarissa’s whole body went still.

She opened her mouth, tried to speak, but no sound came. Her throat burned, words trapped behind pain.

At that moment, panic set in. She wanted to hang up, to stop hearing this, but her trembling hand accidentally hit the speaker button instead.

Norris’s voice rang out clearly as he replied, “Yes. I can’t forget you. Are you happy now?”

Clarissa’s breath caught, stunned. And then, the unmistakable sound of lips meeting rang out from the other end.

In a hurry, her hand fumbled as she ended the call, but in the chaos, the phone slipped and landed in the water. She reached for it without thinking and forgot all about her damaged legs.

She fell hard onto the pavement, right into the cold rain.

For a moment, she lay there, frozen. The storm kept beating down on her, soaking her completely. And then, something inside her broke.

She buried her face in her arms and sobbed.

Fifteen years, she had loved a man who only had eyes for someone else.

Five years of marriage, only to find out it had all been built on guilt and that she had merely been a placeholder.

""Why? Why..."" she whispered over and over, her voice cracking through the rain like a broken song.

Her tears blended with the rain, her pain heavier than the cold that seeped into her bones. And eventually, darkness took her.

When Clarissa finally woke up, she was in a hospital bed.

She blinked slowly, disoriented. A glance at the clock told her it was already noon the next day.

Her phone, which someone had carefully dried out overnight, sat on the bedside table, fully functional, but still silent. No messages. Not a single word from him.

She sat up, just about to call for the discharge paperwork, when the door opened.

She turned her head, a flicker of hope sparking in her eyes, only to see the driver walk in.

The light in her eyes faded instantly.

“Mrs. Daniel,” he greeted awkwardly. “Mr. Daniel’s car got stuck last night, so he asked me to pick you up. How are you feeling?”

Clarissa forced a smile and nodded. The excuse was pathetic, but she didn’t want to make things harder for the driver. So, she simply said, “I’m alright. Let’s go home.”

As such, he quickly took care of the discharge and brought her back.

When they reached the front door, she sat outside for a long time, trying to pull herself together. Only after smoothing out her expression and faking a smile did she open the door.

But the moment she pushed it open, she heard a voice inside.

“Norris, look how much Matthew looks like you.”

Chapter 2

Third Person's POV

Clarissa’s hands froze on the wheels of her chair, stuck in the entryway, unable to go any further.

But Norris’s voice still reached her ears.

“Gabrielle,” he said firmly, “I don’t want to hear you say things like that again, especially not when Clarissa is around.”

Gabrielle’s smile stiffened for a moment. She brushed her hair behind her ear and murmured, “Alright.But one day you will tell her the truth that your divorce is not a fake one but a real one.”

Clarissa stood frozen by the door. Her heart thudded in her chest as she turned to leave, desperate to get out, but in her panic, she bumped hard into the shoe cabinet.

Silence filled the room, and then came hurried footsteps.

Moments later, Norris appeared in front of her, holding a child in his arms.

Clarissa looked up and, unexpectedly, found herself agreeing with what Gabrielle had said earlier. The child really did look like him.

When Norris saw the redness in her eyes, his heart skipped a beat. He quickly set the child down and knelt in front of her, taking her hand in his.

“Clarissa, what happened? My car broke down last night, so I asked the driver to pick you up. Where did you go? Why did he take so long getting you home? If he can’t even do his job right, I’ll just find someone else.”

His concern sounded caring, but every word pierced her like a thorn. She gave a bitter laugh. He hadn’t even bothered to coordinate his lies with the driver.

She had thought she'd grown numb to all of this, that she wouldn’t feel the pain anymore.

But her heart still ached.

Turning away, she wiped the tears from the corner of her eyes and forced a smile. “It’s nothing worth fussing over. I was with a friend.”

Norris visibly relaxed. “As long as you were with someone you trust. When did you get home? I didn’t hear a thing.”

And just like that, Clarissa understood.

All that faux concern was just a setup for this question.

He wanted to know if she’d overheard anything she wasn’t supposed to.

The warmth inside her turned cold. She pulled her hand back and replied calmly, “I just got in. I didn’t hear a thing.”

Norris’s smile faltered, and his hand hung awkwardly in the air. Even so, he didn’t press the issue.

Clarissa looked past him and noticed the woman still standing behind.

Norris quickly stood and explained, “Clarissa, Gabrielle just got back here and doesn’t have a place to stay. Coincidentally, she’s also become my mom’s new doctor, so I let her stay here for now. Don’t get it wrong.”

The way he tried to defend Gabrielle was so natural and instinctive, extinguishing the last flicker of hope in Clarissa’s chest.

She looked away and clenched her fists, trying to maintain a shred of dignity. “I understand. I’m tired. I’d like to rest now.”

Norris was caught off guard by her composure. A strange feeling tugged at him, but he didn’t dwell on it. Assuming she just needed sleep, he moved to wheel her into the master bedroom.

But she stopped him, saying, “I want to go to my own room.”

In that instant, he froze.

Clarissa didn’t understand why he’d suddenly halted until Gabrielle stepped forward, child in tow, and pointed toward a door.

“You mean that room?” she asked, her tone light, but her words sharp. “That used to be my room when I lived here. I’m used to it, so Norris said I could have it again.”

She called him with such familiarity that it made Clarissa’s stomach turn. More than that, she heard the deliberate challenge in Gabrielle’s voice.

Clarissa turned her head slowly, searching Norris’s expression, hoping for a word of support.

But he offered none.

“It’s just a room,” he said with a shrug. “If Gabrielle wants it, then let's just let her be. I’ll just get the guest room cleaned up for you.”

Clarissa shut her eyes for a moment, fighting back the tide of hurt swelling in her chest.

That room was the one he had carefully decorated for her right after they married. He’d given it to her because he knew her parents had died young, and she had no family to go back to.

He told her that the room would be her sanctuary. If she was ever angry with him and didn’t want to talk, she could go there, and he’d know to come make things right.

But now, he’d given it away like it meant nothing.

Like it was just a room.

Clarissa pressed her hand to her chest, trying to ease the tight, suffocating ache.

Then, firmly insisted, “No. I want that room.”

Third Person's POV

As soon as the words left her mouth, the atmosphere in the room grew heavy.

Norris’s brows furrowed. He couldn’t understand why Clarissa was making such a fuss over a room. Before he could say anything, Matthew came running over.

He charged straight at Clarissa, waving his arms and hitting her legs and face with tiny but surprisingly sharp blows.

“You’re a bad person! A bad lady! Don’t bully my mom! That’s my mom’s room!”

Though small, the boy’s strikes had force behind them. Clarissa’s legs throbbed from the impact. Just as she reached out to push him away, he yanked her hair instead. Pain shot through her scalp, and she instinctively grabbed his wrist to stop him.

But before she could say a word, Matthew screamed.

“Mommy! My hand hurts! She’s hurting me! She’s bullying me! Waaah!”

His wails echoed through the massive villa.

Clarissa winced as her scalp throbbed, tears springing to her eyes from the sting. Her first instinct was to look at Norris. But he wasn’t looking at her, his worried gaze was fixed on Matthew.

She followed his line of sight, and her heart dropped. Matthew’s wrist was bleeding.

Shocked, she sat frozen as Gabrielle scooped the child into her arms, tears streaming down her face as she cradled him.

Clarissa’s mind was still blank when Norris’s voice exploded in fury.

“Clarissa! Matthew is just a kid. What are you doing, picking a fight with him? I already told you Gabrielle is just staying here temporarily. Do you really have to keep holding on to the past? It's just a room. Do you have to be so petty and pick a fight with her over it?”

His blatant favoritism hit Clarissa like a slap to the face, but she forced herself to stay calm.

“Norris—” she began, her voice low.

But he cut her off sharply. “Enough! This is still my house, and it’s not your place to decide who stays where. I gave her that room. Even if you're upset, why did you take it out on a child? I’m really disappointed in you. Think about your actions.”

With that, he stormed out the door, carrying Matthew in his arms like a devoted father. Gabrielle followed close behind.

As she passed Clarissa, Gabrielle threw her a quick smile—small, smug, and unmistakably triumphant.

Only then did she understand everything.

With the red marks from Matthew’s hits still fresh on her face, she watched the three of them together like one happy family. At that moment, she realized she was the outsider.

The tears came uncontrollably then. Her breathing grew ragged, and her chest ached like she couldn’t pull in enough air. She had no idea how long she had cried. At some point, she must have cried herself to sleep.

She was just jolted awake by the ringing of her phone.

She picked it up and heard her aunt’s familiar, gentle voice on the other end.

“Clarissa, the immigration paperwork will be finalized within a week. Are you serious this time? You’re not backing out again, are you? It’s been so long. I miss you.”

Clarissa gave a bitter smile. “I’m serious. I might be bothering you for the rest of my life.”

There was a short pause before her aunt spoke again.

“What about Norris? Are you two… divorced?”

Clarissa let out a quiet, “Mm.Divorced, it's a real divorce."" Clarissa repeated painfully, remembering what Norris said.

Her aunt’s heart ached for her, but she knew comforting words wouldn’t help. So instead, she offered warmth.

“Then start packing. I’ll come to pick you up in a week. Don’t worry about bringing anything. We’ve got everything you need here in the Netherlands.”

“Daryll is still worried about you. He is the Daryll who pursued you when they were little.”

Aunt bit of kindness finally eased the weight in Clarissa’s chest.

After they hung up, she looked around the house. There really wasn’t anything she needed to take with her.

If Gabrielle wanted the room so badly, let her have it.

She could have Norris, too.

That night, Clarissa picked a clean guest room at random, curled up on the bed, and quickly drifted off.

She didn’t know how long she’d slept before a sharp sound of glass shattering startled her awake.

She shot upright and followed the noise, which had come from the master bedroom.

Confused, she wondered what kind of glass item would even be in there. But as she got closer to the door, a sudden chill ran through her. Her instincts screamed that something wasn’t right.

She rushed to the door, pushed it open, and her eyes went wide.

“What the hell are you doing?!”

Chapter 3

Third Person's POV

Glass shards covered the floor. The once-beautiful wedding photo that used to hang on the wall was now shattered and torn beyond repair.

Matthew was stomping on her face in the picture, laughing as he did, spewing crude words that no child his age should even know.

Across the room, Gabrielle turned her head with a smirk, clearly enjoying the scene. Her eyes locked on Clarissa with a mocking glint. She didn’t see her as a threat, barely even as a person.

Then she turned to her son and gave him instructions like she was coaching a performance.

""Matthew, do you want Daddy or not? If you do, then do exactly what Mommy just told you.""

The boy nodded like an obedient little soldier. Then, without a second of hesitation, he picked up a lighter and flicked it on, holding it to a diary clutched in his other hand.

Clarissa's heart seized.

“No! Don’t. Don’t do that!” she shouted, panic surging through her chest.

Frantically, she pushed her wheelchair forward, chasing him down the room. But Matthew thought it was a game. He ran in circles, always just out of reach, laughing like this was all some kind of sick fun.

By the time she finally caught up, the damage was done. The diary had burned to nothing—just a pile of gray ash.

Clarissa’s hands trembled as she picked up the one tiny, half-burnt corner left. Her shoulders shook with sobs she could no longer hold back.

That diary had been the only thing her parents left her. It documented their short lives, their hopes, and their love. It was her only connection to them. For years, in the lonely silence of her life, she'd read it to feel less alone.

When she married Norris, she had brought it with her to this house. She wanted to lock it away, but he told her not to worry.

""As long as I’m here, no one would dare touch it,"" he had said.

But he didn’t keep his word.

Now, not only had someone touched it—they’d destroyed it. And he’d let them walk in and do it.

Clarissa clutched the tiny scrap of paper tightly in her palm. Her voice was raw with fury and heartbreak as she shouted, “Gabrielle! Is this how you raise your son? Teaching him to destroy things that don’t belong to him? Did you ever teach him what basic respect even means?”

For a moment, Gabrielle looked taken aback. Her eyes reddened, and tears welled up.

“Matthew never had a father growing up. I raised him alone. Blame me if you want, but he’s still just a child. You don’t have to be so harsh. I’m sorry, okay? I’ll apologize.”

Clarissa frowned, unsure how to respond, but then she felt a heavy gaze.

She turned and saw Norris standing at the doorway, his expression dark. He strode toward them, face set in a deep scowl.

“Clarissa,” he said, “he’s a child. Why do you keep picking fights with him? Gabrielle even agreed to give you the room back. Isn’t that enough? Do you really have to drive them out to feel satisfied?”

His voice was sharp, edged with frustration.

Clarissa’s heart clenched. She held up the charred piece of the diary with shaking hands, her voice breaking as she tried to explain, “Norris, do you even know what he—”

Before she could finish, he slapped the burnt scrap from her hand.

“It’s just a notebook, Clarissa!” he snapped. “What boy his age isn’t a little wild? Must you make such a big deal out of it? If you want, I’ll buy you a hundred more, a thousand! Will that finally be enough for you?”

She stared at the paper fragment as it fluttered to the ground, only to be stepped on by Gabrielle’s heel.

That was it. Something in her finally gave way.

A hollow laugh escaped her lips, bitter and worn out. She let her body fall back in the wheelchair like all the fight had drained from her.

“Fine,” she said quietly. “You’re right. I’m sorry. It’s my fault.”

For a second, Norris’s expression shifted. Her defeated tone hit him in a place he didn’t expect, and it stung. Seeing despair in her lifeless eyes, he opened his mouth, maybe to apologize, but before he could speak, Matthew cut in.

“Uncle Norris, can I play with this?” the boy asked, holding up a small gift box in his hands.

Norris glanced over, assuming it was just some empty box lying around.

“Sure,” he said. “Go ahead.”

But Clarissa knew exactly what was inside. Her eyes widened in panic, and she quickly shouted, “No! You can’t touch that!”

Third Person's POV

Just when a trace of guilt had begun to creep into Norris’s heart, Clarissa’s voice made him frown again.

“It’s just an old box. Do you have to be so petty, Clarissa? Or is it that you just can’t stand anything he does?”

Clarissa froze. His words hit her like a slap. She stared at him, disbelief washing over her. It hit her then. He truly didn’t remember what was in that box.

Her hand, which had reached out instinctively, lingered midair. She hesitated for a long moment, thinking maybe she should remind him about the ring.

But before she could say anything, Matthew cut in.

“Uncle Norris, I really want this box. Can I throw out what’s inside?”

Already irritated by Clarissa, Norris didn’t even think twice. He just wanted to shut this whole scene down.

“Sure. Toss it if you want.”

Clarissa’s heart sank when she saw Matthew pull out the ring. Her chest tightened, and she instinctively tried to reach for it.

But Matthew was already walking toward the fireplace, just about to toss it in, when he paused. He looked back at his mother.

“Mom, this ring’s kind of pretty. Are you sure we should throw it away?”

Gabrielle’s face stiffened. She didn’t dare look at Norris. Instead, she blinked rapidly, silently urging her son to go through with it.

Norris’s expression shifted slightly when he heard the word “ring.” He turned to look, only to see it fall into the fire.

In a flash, the flames swallowed it.

His gaze snapped to Clarissa. He opened his mouth several times, trying to speak, but the look in her eyes left him hollow. Words stuck in his throat.

Clarissa didn’t look at him. Without a word, she wheeled herself to the fireplace and reached in, trying to retrieve the ring.

The fire had only just started and wasn’t roaring yet, but it was still hot enough to make her flinch and hiss from the pain.

Norris’s heart twisted at the sight. He instinctively stepped forward, ready to pull her back, but Gabrielle got there first.

She hurried over with her son in her arms, gave him a few heavy pats, then turned teary eyes on Clarissa.

“I’m so sorry. This is all my fault. I didn’t teach him better. Please, let me apologize on his behalf. Just tell me how much the ring costs. I’ll save up and buy you a new one.”

Clarissa stared at her blankly, the expression on Gabrielle’s face utterly fake to her.

Not getting a response, Gabrielle glanced at Norris from the corner of her eye and saw his attention still fixed on Clarissa. Her gaze hardened. Then, with a thud, she dropped to her knees.

“It’s all my fault. Please, Clarissa, forgive me. If you’re still mad, then hit me. Go ahead!”

She grabbed Clarissa’s hand and slapped it against her own face. Clarissa tried to pull back, but Gabrielle wouldn’t let go.

A loud smack echoed through the room. Gabrielle’s cheek reddened immediately.

Not satisfied, she let go of Clarissa’s hand and began slapping herself, over and over, crying and apologizing between each blow.

Clarissa frowned at the absurd scene. She opened her mouth to tell her to stop the act, but before she could speak, Norris shoved her away.

Her wheelchair wasn’t locked, so the sudden force sent her sliding backward. The chair slammed into the desk behind her, and she tumbled out, landing hard on the floor.

Norris hadn’t meant to push her that hard. His eyes widened in shock, and he started toward her, but Gabrielle caught his arm first.

He turned to see her swollen, tear-streaked face. Something in him froze. Without saying anything, he pulled her into his arms protectively.

Then he looked down at Clarissa coldly.

“Clarissa, Gabrielle already apologized. Why won’t you let it go? It’s just a ring. Did you really have to humiliate her by trying to fish it out of the fire?”

Clarissa lay awkwardly on the floor, her burned hand pressed against the wooden floorboards. Pain shot through her, leaving her speechless.

Her legs were numb, making it useless. Still, she tried to lift herself multiple times, only to collapse again and again. The helplessness brought tears to her eyes.

Norris hesitated, guilt flickering in his eyes. He took a step forward to help, but Matthew quickly grabbed his hand.

“Uncle Norris, it’s my fault. I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to make her mad.”

His small hand tugged gently, and that was all it took for Norris’s heart to soften. He steeled himself once again against Clarissa.

“If you love making life difficult for others so much,” he said coldly, “then you can pick yourself up off the floor. Let’s see how long you can keep playing the victim.”

Clarissa stared at him as he stepped right on their torn wedding photo, grinding it under his shoe.

It felt like he was stepping on her heart, crushing what little hope she had left.

In that moment, something inside her broke.

She didn’t want to love him anymore.

Not even a little.

Chapter 4

Third Person's POV

Clarissa lay on the floor for what felt like forever before finally managing to crawl back into her wheelchair.

The bedroom, once warm and comforting, was now a complete mess. But Norris didn’t seem to see any of it. All he remembered was her being ""dramatic.""

Clarissa let out a soft laugh, more bitter than amused, like she was mocking herself.

A moment later, she pulled out her phone and dialed her lawyer.

“How much longer will it take?”

Attorney Turner sounded surprised,. “I was just about to call you!

The process is almost done,the marriage relationship will be dissolved tomorrow.”

Clarissa found herself subconsciously picking at her palm. So, five years of marriage end in less than five days.

She swallowed the last trace of hesitation and told him to bring it over tonight.

But before she even had time to read the papers, Norris unexpectedly called her away to attend a family dinner.

But this is not the problem.The actual problem is that  past few weeks he started to come to our home very frequently even if dad's not there especially once mom comes home after work.My mom didn't care about his visits as he's a close one to dad.Initially he would just wait in the sofa till dad comes or might leave if dad's not coming anytime soon.Usually mom would give him tea and snacks,converse with him during those times.But over the days I saw him starting to exhibit questionable behaviours toward my mom and my mom let them all slid by given his condition.It is so embarassing for me as a son to see my mom letting him do that to her.
Yesterday evening is when I got fed up with all his antics;He came home when dad and mom were not home(as dad and mom went for a marriage).As I was the only one at home,I made him coffee and told about them not being home.He suddenly started to act silly and loud saying that he misses my dad and my mom;*then the drunken bastard started to comment how my mom is his angel,how she's the only woman he's been ever with,how she's the only woman in his entire life,how she's the one whom he's ever spent his precious time with and other things that can't be shared in public*. Following that he fell on the ground asking to meet dad saying he can't live without meeting his friend and stuff.I was so confused and angry that I really wanted to hit him.But before such things happened he himself came to senses,for some reason forced his golden ring in my hand saying that it's his gift for me (dad returned it back today) and literally moved swiftly out of home.

Chapter 1

By chance,I discovered that Ken Dixon had hidden a wedding ring at home.I thought,after seven years of secretly dating,he was finally going to propose to me.

Yet,even though I had been waiting for a long time,only to find that he brought the ring box to the company party

I watched with my own eyes as he got down on one knee and proposed to the intern,Hazel Easton,in front of everyone at work.

Hazel slipped on the ring,kissed Ken passionately and excitedly said,“I do!”

Overwhelmed with joy,she ran over to celebrate with everyone with a glass of wine in her hand.However,she tripped and the wine splashed everywhere.

Instinctively,I shielded the bag in my hands. In doing so,I accidentally stepped into a gap and knocked over a table full of red wine bottles.

Ken's face changed in an instant.He scolded me harshly,""Assistant White,why are you always so clumsy?You ruined a whole table full of wine!”

It escaped his mind how much I cherish this bag,simply because this was the first gift he gave me when we first fell in love.

After he finished lashing out at me,he wrapped his arm around Hazel to comfort her.I rushed into the restroom and dialed home.

“Mom,I’ve changed my mind.I’ll agree to the arranged marriage you mentioned.”

——

There was a stunned pause on the other end of the call,then came the excitement,“Well….I thought I’d never see the day!Sweetheart,I’ll start making arrangements right away!""

I chuckled with a hint of self-mockery.

My mother always thought I had never been in a relationship before,but that actually was not true.

Ken and I had been together for seven years.He never wanted to announce our relationship publicly.He claimed the company had a strict no-dating policy for internal staff.

I had never told my mother about this because I did not want her to be worried or upset.

However,since he was about to marry another,there was no need to say anything.

“When are you coming home?I’ll arrange the meeting,”Mom asked.

“Soon,”I replied softly.

I hung up and opened the restroom door,only to see Ken standing at the door.

He looked gentle,even remorseful,as he reached for my hand.

“Baby,did you hurt yourself just now?Everyone from the company had come,so I had to act cold.About the proposal...I’ll explain everything once we’re home,okay?”

Explain?How could he possibly explain this?He had already proposed and put the ring on someone else's finger?Was there anything to explain?

I raised my head to look at him detachedly,""I understand.""

""…Honey,""he said with a cajoling tone,but his brows furrowed a little.

However,before he managed to say anything else,a colleague walked out of the party room.Instantly,his expression changed.He dropped my hand and slipped back into his usual cold,distant demeanor.

Then he said,""Emily White,remember your place.You’re my assistant,the company’s general assistant.Don’t embarrass me.”

My heart turned extremely cold.I lowered my eyes and replied quietly,“I understand.”

Ken turned around and walked into the restroom,without sparing a single glance at me.

My colleague went toward me and consoled me quietly,""Assistant White,don’t take it to heart. It might be that the boss was in distress because you interrupted his perfect,joyous occasion.""

My smile stiffened.

What did she mean by""a perfect joyous occasion?""

Ken never told anyone at the company that we were in a relationship.Even when we traveled abroad for business and stayed at the same hotel,I would leave half an hour earlier and he would come a little later.We always took a different route.

In fact,the company’s most gossipy receptionist never picked up on anything unusual between me and Ken in all seven years.

For seven years,he had played his role so well and I played mine perfectly.

Just once in a while,I would quietly ask him when he was hugging me late at night,""When are we going to go public?I want to be the boss's wife openly.”

He would always give me a peck and reasoned,""Just wait a bit longer.The company's general mood is in a sensitive period.I'm afraid I'll be giving out a bad influence.""

That‘just wait a bit longer’turned into seven long years.People said the seven-year itch was real and I would not wait any longer.



Chapter 2

I chose not to stay and drink,so I left the party early and went home.

As the night deepened,my phone finally rang.

""Why did you leave without saying anything to me?""asked Ken in a disapproving way.

I answered calmly,“I went home.”

“A few young ladies from work got drunk.I’m dropping them off at their hotel.I’ll go there and be with you after that,okay?”

Huh!Is it a few young ladies,or just your new fiancée?

Although the question had already been on my lips,I did not say it out loud.I did not want to humiliate myself.

Just then,I heard a soft,female voice from the other end of the phone.“Boss,I can walk on my own…”

Then the call abruptly ended.However,I could still hear him clearly while persuading her with a low voice.""Don't make a fuss.I'll carry you.""

I held my phone tightly.I felt as if someone had suddenly poured a bucket of ice water over me.

I remembered years ago,on a business trip,I had gotten drunk.I playfully said I could not walk and hoped he would carry me.However,he scolded me in a low voice,""Stop acting out.What if someone sees us?”

Then he dragged me into the corner of the elevator and left immediately.

On the contrary,with Hazel,he was willing to carry her on his back in front of everyone,regardless of the repercussions.

Of course.They’re an official,legitimate couple now.There was no longer any need for secrecy,as Ken had in the past.

Despite being heartbroken,I started packing my stuff.Only then did I realize something.The house I had shared with Ken for seven years had a neat layout and minimal furnishings. It was more like an exquisite showroom.There no warmth nor traces of a couple living together.There was also not a single photo of us together.

This was because Ken kept saying,“Let’s keep the house as simple and clean as possible.I sometimes have video meetings at home and I don’t want anyone to notice anything.”

At that time,I believed him.Noticing how meticulous and cautious he was,I even thought it was a sign of how responsible he was about his career.

Now,I realized that he was not cautious around outsiders.He was only careful around me.

At half past five in the morning,I had just fallen asleep when the door burst open with a loud bang.Ken had finally come back.

The man reeked of alcohol and a strong smell of perfume.A faint lipstick mark was still on his face.

As soon as he stepped into the room,he took off his coat and reached out to hug me.Then his eyes fell on the pile of old belongings scattered across the floor and he frowned.

Then he said,""Baby,are you mad because I proposed to Hazel tonight?She’s the daughter of the Easton Group’s chairman.I’m planning to use that connection here to secure a deal with the Easton Family.”

“You know how long we’ve been trying to land the investment from the Easton Group,right?It took me ages to figure out Hazel’s connection to them.Just bear with it for now.Once I get the investment,I’ll cut ties with her.”



Chapter 3

My gaze that landed on Ken was filled with disappointment.If this had been back when we first started dating,I might have actually believed his words.However,now,after waiting for him for seven years,all I knew was when Ken said""bear with it"".What he meant was that it would probably be many more years.

I was truly exhausted.I could not keep doing this anymore.I had wasted seven years of my youth,I might as well treat it as I fed my love to a black hole.

When he saw that I did not pay him any attention,Ken did not care.He turned around to get a drink,but his foot stepped on something.

Crack!

My head snapped up.I saw the broken string of beads on the floor crushed beneath his foot.

It was the bracelet I had handwoven for him during our first Valentine’s Day together.While packing last night,I couldn’t bear to throw it away,so I left it on the floor to take with me.

He glanced down at it and,with a frown full of disdain,as if he had just seen something filthy.He said,“What’s this?Don’t just toss garbage on the floor.”

My heart hurt so [much.It](http://much.It) felt as if our seven years together were crushed by his kick.

Without even another glance,he said lazily,“Baby,I know you’re the best.You’ll understand me.I’m going to take a shower and a quick nap.Later this morning,come with me to scout the mall venue.”

Ken was always so sure that I would never leave him.

As the bathroom door shut,I looked at the door for a while and took a deep breath.Then I turned around and,one by one,threw all those once-precious pieces of“trash”into the garbage bin.

That included the matching couple mugs that I had bought but never used,travel photos,a souvenir keychain he had given me and little decor items I had once dreamed of putting on our wedding tables.

Seven years of love were tossed in an instant and strangely,I didn’t feel a thing.

Two hours later,after he took a shower and changed clothes,Ken and I headed to the mall to scout the venue.

As we walked past the entrance,a staff member mentioned,“Hey,there’s a new limited-edition collab milk tea next door.There is already a huge queue over there and they're only selling it today.”

Ken suddenly turned to me and asked,""Do you want it?

I froze and instinctively looked up at him.Was he actually…offering to buy something for me in public?

In seven years,he had never shown me the slightest affection or attention in front of others.

""I….""

Before I could even nod,he turned back with a smile and said to the people behind us,“Thanks for all your hard work,everyone.I’ll treat you to milk tea,one cup for each of you.”

My hand that was just hanging loose at my side clenched quietly,then slowly relaxed.

That man has not changed at all.

Emily,Emily,you’re about to walk away anyway.Why are you still hoping for here?

While waiting for the milk tea,I headed for a less crowded corner.

With a cup of milk tea in his hand,Ken walked through the crowd and went straight towards me.

He handed me the drink.“Here!I ordered this one especially for you.”

I glanced down. It was strawberry milk.

My fingers trembled slightly.I replied in a flat voice,“I don’t drink that.”

His brows furrowed and his tone instantly turned cold.""Emily,you’re being difficult again. You just said you wanted to drink milk tea before and now you’re saying you don’t?This is what everyone bought.What am I supposed to do with yours?Waste it?”



Chapter 4

I looked up at him gently and suddenly my eyes stung.

Seven years ago,he made a point to remember that I was allergic to strawberries.He said even a sip would make me swell up like crazy.Once,I accidentally drank the wrong milk and ended up in the hospital,He was so panicked,he cried in the hallway.

However,now,the man who once cried because of my allergy…couldn’t even remember the one thing I could not have.

I swallowed hard,but I could not take this anymore.“I think we should break….""

Before I could finish,a familiar voice cut me off.

“Boss!”

Hazel came bouncing over in her sugary-sweet voice and snatched the milk from his hand with a sweet smile.“This is the one I recommended to you yesterday,right?You really bought it today?You’re so good to me.”

As she spoke,she naturally hooked her arm around Ken’s.

Clearly,Ken was stumped for a moment and a flicker of awkwardness flashed across his face,but he did not push her away.

Then,as if something had suddenly entered her mind,Hazel tapped her head and gave me a small smile as she said,""Miss White…the boss treats me so well,so when do you think I should meet his family?By the way,do you have a boyfriend?Maybe you could give me some advice?”

My heart hurt so much that I could not get a single word out.

Ken gave me a frantic look.He silently begged me not to make a scene.

At that moment,I felt very tired.I took a deep breath and replied,“I don’t know.”

Ken quickly backed me up.""Yeah,General Assistant only knows how to work and doesn't know about this kind of stuff.""

Hazel looked disappointed.“Really?I thought you’d been in a relationship for a long time already,General Assistant.”

I looked down with a numb heart.

Even though she showed up to the site visit during working hours,which was totally against company policy,not only did Ken not rebuke her at all,he also let her tag along as they started the inspection process together.

When we passed one of the company’s catering brand stores,Hazel suddenly came up beside me and whispered sweetly,""Miss White,I’m a little nervous.Can we walk together?”

She smiled at me and then,without saying anything,she grabbed my wrist.

Annoyed,I tried to shake her off,but even though I did not use much force,she stumbled backward dramatically and his back slammed into an older man who was drinking soup with his head down.

Splash!

A whole bowl of hot soup spilled all over his pant leg.

The man’s face darkened,he shot to his feet and roared,“What the hell is wrong with you?Why did you push people?My pants are soaked!You better pay for this!”

I was petrified.

Before I could even react,Hazel lowered her head and started apologizing for her fault,""Sorry,I'm so sorry.I did not know why the general assistant suddenly pushed me.I really didn’t mean to disturb your lunch...”

She sounded so weak and pittiful,while I was like shrew that bullied her in public.

Suddenly,Ken yanked my wrist,his face twisted with anger as he snapped,""Emily,what the hell are you doing?Apologize.Now!”



Chapter 5

I looked up at him in disappointment and refuted him,“I didn’t push her!”

He disregarded my words and wrinkled his forehead.“Everyone’s watching,don’t ruin the company’s image.”

The older man squinted at us,his gaze shifting back and forth between me and Hazel. In an instant,he figured out who the easier target was.

He suddenly grabbed my arm,his fingers dug painfully into my skin like he was afraid I would flee.He leaned extremely close toward me.His eyes were leering shamelessly at my chest.

“Come on,sweetheart,apologize. You spilled soup all over me and now you wanna act all high and mighty?”

Ken,who was standing on the side,was oblivious to the man's harassment of me because his attention was locked solely on Hazel.

Hazel lowered her head and bit her lips with a sad look on her face.""Boss,it was my fault.Please don’t blame Miss White.""

Ken immediately felt heartbroken.He patted her shoulder.It's not your fault.This is because the general assistant is so clumsy.""

My throat tightened.Just as I opened my mouth to say something,I heard Hazel softly say to the man,“I’m really sorry.I’ll pay for your pants,okay?I should’ve been steadier,so you failed to eat.""

Ken’s expression darkened as he turned to me.“See?Look how responsible Hazel is,but you?You don't even have a shred of decency.”

The next second,he picked up the leftover bowl of soup from the table and coldly dumped it right over my head.

The scalding soup with its oily smell immediately drenched me from the top of my head,stuck to my hair,soaked through my collar and trickled down slowly at the back of my neck.

At that moment,I felt completely numb.

Ken slammed the bowl back on the table and coldly said,“Emily,you’re heartless and [selfish.You](http://selfish.You) won’t even say sorry.”

The uncle smiled.His face was full of wrinkles.

“No wonder you’re the boss and she’s the boss lady,you two have good manners.You're not like these stubborn workers with no manners!”After he said that,he spat at me.

Ken didn’t even look back.He grabbed Hazel’s hand and walked away.

I was left there,standing alone,as the soup slowly dripped from my forehead,then it hit the floor with a tiny ticking sound.

I went home,changed my clothes and washed myself for three hours,but I still couldn’t wash off that disgusting stench.

I wrote my resignation letter word for word and took it with me to the office the next day.

As the elevator doors opened,the receptionist glanced up at me,her face was full of gossip.

""General Assistant,do you know what?The boss is so handsome while holding the boss lady's hand.""

I looked up.She grinned and handed me her phone,showing a photo of Ken and Hazel walking side by side.

In the dim light,he was holding her while my dejected back followed not far behind,covered in soup like an outsider.

“We didn’t even know you were behind them,General Assistant.""

She stiffened,suddenly realizing what she had said and quickly tucked her phone away.

“I'm sorry!We just thought they looked like the main couple in a novel or something.We got a little carried away…”

I didn’t say a word.I walked straight to the HR department and handed in my resignation letter.

The HR lady took a look at it and with a little surprise on her face,""Are you resigning?""

I nodded.“Yes.”

She hesitated,then said,“Yesterday,the boss proposed to Hazel and he even announced that the company’s no-dating policy is officially canceled.General Assistant…are you upset?""

My hand trembled and I almost dropped the resignation letter to the floor.

So,the rule that I had been waiting for seven years for,which was""the time isn't right yet"",that I had heard over and over again,could be cancelled with just a few words for Hazel.



Chapter 6

I said a few perfunctory comments and turned to leave.

Inside the office,someone was talking,""Can you believe the general assistant has been secretly in love with the president for so many years and yet,she never gets any acknowledgement at all.I bet she must be fuming right now.""

“Shhh…keep it down.She’s still here.”

I heard every word,crystal clear.

In their eyes,the fact that I loved Ken was so obvious.Meanwhile,as for Ken,no one could ever tell whether he liked me back or not.

I just smiled,then went back to my office to continue organizing the handover documents.Actually,I could just walk out,but I had been working in the company for seven years and I needed a closure.

Just when I was about to save the data,suddenly,the office door swung open nd Hazel barged in without warning.

""Hai,Emily,""she sneered.""Are you still organizing the data?

She shut the door behind her and smirked.“Too [bad.No](http://bad.No) matter how hard you work,you’ll never beat someone with the title‘CEO’s fiancée’.”

I paused working on the keyboard,then looked up at her calmly.

Hazel stepped closer.

“I've actually known for a while that you're the girlfriend Ken's been secretly dating for a long time,but it doesn't matter.I was the one Ken proposed,wasn't I?""

“We were high school classmates,you know…and we had a little fling back then.”

""Do you know that when we bumped into each other at a reunion,we were so passionate that he immediately brought me into the company

After she laid out all the facts for a long time,she finally got to the point.

“Emily,if you know better,you should just step aside.”

I stared at her face nonchalantly and answered coldly,“I’m working.Please leave.”

Hazel laughed like I’d told her the funniest joke.“Working?You think you still have a place here?”

Before I could react,she moved like a blur and I was unprepared for what came next.

Smack!

A sharp sound echoed.She did not slap me,but slapped herself.A red handprint bloomed across her cheek and tears welled up instantly.She pretended to look panicked.

""Ah!""

She screamed,then grabbed my coffee and threw it onto her chest.The hot liquid soaked her blouse,dripped down her arms and flowed onto my open laptop.

I jerked to my feet,“You're insane!”

The sound of a short circuit was heard and the computer screen went black instantly.

The handover documents and project backup files I had spent three days and nights on were all gone.

I saw red and my control finally snapped.I could not take it anymore and grabbed her collar as anger exploded within me.

“Hazel!You’ve gone too far!”

She screamed,stumbled back,knocked a chair,then she pushed me away and bolted for the door.

She was crying as she ran and threw herself into Ken's arms,who just happened to pass by.

“Ken!”she sobbed.“I only wanted to apologize…to Miss White,but she was jealous because you poured soup on her.She tried to pour soup on me,too and I did not dodge it.She even hit me….""

She cried so hard,as if she had really suffered greatly.

Ken’s eyes narrowed at me.They were cold and ruthless.

“Emily,how could you be so vicious?”

He marched over.There was no trace of doubt or hesitation in his eyes.

Slap!

A loud slap exploded across my face.

The office went deathly silent in a flash.They directed their eyes at us,filled with shock and disbelief.

I was the backbone of this company.The general manager they depended on daily,the woman who led so many projects for seven years.However,that kind of person was slapped by the boss in public.

My face immediately swelled with so much pain.However,my gaze locked onto his eyes.I wanted to see if there was a hint of hesitation or apology in them.

However,there was none.He pulled Hazel protectively behind him.“Don’t worry,”he said to her.“I'm here and I won’t let anyone hurt you.”

My arms dropped to my sides.

At the HR department,the girl who had been holding my resignation finally stamped the document and approved it.

I walked out of the company without a backward glance.

Ken did not chase after me either.He scoffed.""This is too much!She’s just an employee,but dares to throw a tantrum.Watch!She’ll come crawling back.”

I blocked Ken on every platform,called someone to pack my things and had them shipped to my old house.

Before I left the company,I stood at the door for the last time and looked back.

I was the one who built this company. It was the place I spent seven years of my youth.

It was false to say that there is no reluctance to give up,but it is more important to make a decision when the time comes.

Without any hesitation,I took a taxi and went to the airport,This time, I won't look back.

1l9h414,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/1l9h414/how_has_divorce_saved_you/,How has divorce saved you?,"Ending my marriage was one of the most brutal chapters I've ever been through in my adult life. 

My story included being on the receiving end of a two-month silent treatment I didn't deserve, being called a freeloading impostor and a disgusting loser, crying every day, forgiving him when he needed me to spearhead a business pitch that was pivotal to his career dream, and after all that, finding out that 10 years of my unconditional love for him paled in importance compared to the unplanned $350 we paid for baggage allowance that didn't come with the airline tickets for our business trip.

Despite the hell I was living in, I was terrified of leaving. My career tanked during COVID, so I worked for my ex.  He treated me like his personal slave and paid me under minimum wage. My finances were wrecked and I didn't have a new job lined up for me--I'd been applying and collaborating, but it just wasn't happening.

I checked out months before we really separated, but I was going to get my proverbial ducks in a row first so that I can move on with a sense of security. 

But my marriage decided it was done before I was ready. One morning my ex packed up and drove away. He wanted to retaliate my checking out by leaving on his terms. He wanted to punish me and make me come back crawling to him. And when that failed, he cried a river, not because he loved me but because he lost control over me.

Psychology says, ""You marry your unfinished business. This used to enrage me because it felt like a curse. No matter what good intentions I started the marriage with or how good a wife I'm committed to be, it doesn't matter because I inevitably would attract a partner that brings out the worst in me and embodies everything I loathe about my family of origin, but worse.

My marriage was a long, hard lesson on what I needed to heal from. It took me a marriage from hell to say, ""Enough is enough"" to the dysfunction and living in defeat.

It wasn't too long ago when I felt that everything meaningful in my life has been fucked up and fucked over, and that unfucking my life felt so impossible. I had internalised my husband's lie that without this marriage I'd just be a pariah nobody would want anything to do with. He strategically weaponised shame against me and isolated me from my own world so that his narrative of shame could prevail and control me.

When I felt had no one to talk to about all the things that made me feel ashamed of my life, I started fangirling a rock band whose frontman overcame suicidal depression. Not only did the band make great music that speak to me--it was a testament of how the band had gone through hell and back, and how their unwavering support for each other as a ""friends first"" kind of band prevails.

I joined Reddit initially because of the frontman's AMA. A fellow fan noticed my content in the band's sub, and an initial exchange of favourite songs snowballed into stories of our lives. 

Eventually this person became a sounding board and voice of reason that dismantled the lies my marriage forced upon me and showed me evidence to my own truth. As this online safe space rebooted my relationship to my reality, that also changed how I operated in my offline life.

The biggest takeaway is that we all need a band: not necessarily the kind that plays guitars and drums, but ones that help our inner rock stars shine as we show up to this stage called life.

They say it takes a village to raise a child. I say it takes a band to help a divorcee heal their wounded inner child, find their light, and make their leap of faith into the postnuptial world with peace and power.

So find my band I did. It wasn't a dedicated five-piece, but more like a rotating constellation of session players who show up just at the right song, deliver an epic show with me, then bow out to make room for other people who make the most suitable collaborators for my next song.

It started with my best friend of 30 years, who for a long time wasn't someone I made myself vulnerable for and extended a proper invitation into my inner life. Project Exit Marriage elevated our friendship into an unprecedented level. Not only did she become my loudest cheerleader: she also pointed me to new goals to work on and introduced me to a new professional network that made a difference in my life.

As I started working on new goals and inviting people to help me make them happen, my band showed up for me from unexpected corners of my life. I reconnected with old friends and relatives. I made meaningful friendships with new people and always found something to bond over. They saw good things in me, had good faith in me before I had anything to prove, and helped me before I had anything to give back.

My ex and I separated 19 months ago. A lot has happened since.

I had a fling with a foreign stranger who couldn't stay beyond six months and two vacations. I needed to fall in love with him but was adamant that this fling needed to heal me and not break my heart. I learnt so much by letting him in and letting him show me evidence that I am safe with him. I let my feelings for him blossom, co-created a beautiful intimate space with him and received his generosity in hosting the vacations.

I worked on healing sexual trauma in therapy. When I was 18-19, my first boyfriend raped me, and I'm not done healing from it 20 years later. The rape shattered my self worth and relationship to intimacy, and put me in perpetual self-sabotaging survival mode. Healing changed how I relate to myself and others, and the makeup of my emotional landscape.

I had a close call with my dream job--having been 1 out of the 8 callbacks out of 150 applicants. But after a second interview, the employer decided to hire the other candidate. I cried my eyes out.

Sensing that my career wasn't getting out of trouble, I rage wrote a PhD proposal. It was a long and exhausting ""will I or won't I"" drama that took up most of my year. But I scored the jackpot for a supervisor--not only am I a fan of her work, she also believes in me and cares about me as a person. 

But months before it was a deal, I had more professional struggles. Dozens of applications that went nowhere. Inviting colleagues and acquaintances for coffee to offer collab opportunities for my PhD project and ask about job openings they're aware of. Upskilling and earning an affiliation with a reputable international professional association. Working gigs for a new client that became a friend. Publishing an op-ed in a reputable foreign newspaper. Pitching a journalistic column and getting rejected for it.

I filed for divorce six months in. My country doesn't recognise no-fault divorce so I waited for my ex to forfeit contestation, and got help strategising my divorce plans from experienced friends. My divorce was simple because I don't have kids, a house, and much property. I proceeded DIY in his consented absence beyond the mediation. I got my sock in four months.

I got my PhD scholarship on the 11th hour and have relocated overseas for it. My life is the most downsized it has ever been, but years of hardship have taught me to be resourceful and mindful of the blessings that I do have to be grateful for. 

The new country comes with a new band. I'm living with my mom's best friend of 30 years, she and her family look out for me. I'm reconnecting with old friends and making friends with new one, opening up to budding friendships while patiently nurturing them to grow into something longer term. 

I'm cherishing the solitude of the times I'm not with other people as a valuable space for self care, rest and reflection.

I'm five months into a long distance relationship with a wonderful man who amplifies my happiness and contributes to my sense of stability in this massive season of transition. We don't have long haul future plans but are showing up to this relationship one day at a time, and it feels just right.

These days my mind no longer lives where it did when it was consumed by the grief, anger and terror of my ending marriage. I most definitely don't miss my ex. But that doesn't mean that I didn't love him, or that the marriage meant nothing to me. Who I am today is built upon the legacy of that marriage and having loved my ex. But its breakdown no longer has its chains on my present life.

So how has divorce saved me?

One: Marriage showed me how capable I am of giving unconditional love. Divorce taught me to redirect that unconditional love to the person who truly deserves it, i.e. myself.

Two: Marriage showed me that there is a big difference between being human and experiencing misfortune, vs being evil and wishing misfortune upon your spouse. Divorce taught me to never apologise for being human, and to recognise the people who value my humanity.

Three: Marriage showed me that nothing kills a person's spirit more viciously than isolation and weaponised shame. Divorce taught me how to find my way back to community, to take charge as I free my inner rock star, and to build self-sufficiency and resilience out of my band's gift of respectful care and support.

Four: Marriage showed me that as much as I adored my husband for them, his career and dreams should have never taken precedence over mine--his success does not make him a superior spouse, and my struggles don't make me a loser whose only salvation is servitude to his dream machine. Divorce taught me that my dreams matter, and that with the right band having my back, I have what it takes to pursue them successfully.

Five: Marriage showed me that I cannot make my spouse love me more by getting my shit together, purging myself of the things that make me burdensome, and being more understanding, supportive and sacrificial for him. Divorce taught me that I am enough, I matter, and I deserve to be loved right now and shown up for no matter how messy my life currently is. And people show up for me once I've decided to show up for myself.

Six: Marriage showed me that wedding vows are sacred, but the sanctity of my safety and dignity take precedence over those vows. Evil spouses do exist--they break their vows not because they're oblivious that it hurts you, but because it benefits them at your expense. Divorce taught me that there is a difference between ""till death does us part"" and ""happily ever after."" The former is a tango that takes two, and twos are something you don't get to control. The latter is a fairy tale. True love comes in all kinds of shapes, sizes and capacities. The toxic preoccupation with ""happily ever after"" is the root of missing out on all the good love that is already in your life right now.

Seven: Marriage showed me that you cannot choose love and trauma--and the latter will always prevail by default. Divorce taught me that overcoming trauma isn't hard or complicated: it just takes the readiness to decide that this stops here, and dispelling the trauma's darkness with the light of your support system so that you could envision what it truly means to overcome.

Divorce saved me by teaching me to love myself, own my humanity, welcome my support system, value my dreams, receive love without letting my flaws get in the way, recognise and embrace love in forms other than ""happily ever after,"" and to be ready to heal when it's time.

I don't understand people who say that their marriage was a waste because it ended in divorce. That's like saying they should have never adopted a puppy because the dog got old and died. It's tragic, but doesn't erase the love, joy, and meaning of the dog's presence, and the memories that remain beyond.

Why can't the marriage just be a frozen frame of something that was beautiful in its time? Looking back at my own marriage, I don't see it as a reflection of the happy life my ex and I could have had if certain tragedies never wrecked it. If anything, marriage showed me the monster that my husband really is, and divorce saved me from a tragic premature death at the hands of my own husband.

I wouldn't be who I am today if it weren't for my marriage and divorce. And I love how I turned out--not because my life turned out the way I wanted it to but because I show up for myself and make it work.

How about you? How has divorce saved you?

# Chapter 1

Because my five-year-old twin daughters upset Liam Sterling’s beloved, he sent them to an extreme disciplinary school. The teachers from the school stormed into our home, trying to forcefully take them away. My two daughters clung to the car door, crying and shouting for their father. I knelt on the ground, pleading desperately.

""They're only five years old. They're still so young! Sending them to that place will kill them. I'm their mother. If anyone failed to teach them properly, it’s me. Punish me instead…”

Liam, however, stood there with his beloved in his arms, watching us coldly.

""If you hadn’t spoiled them so much, they wouldn’t have turned out this way—disrespectful and arrogant! I’m their father, and if you can’t teach them, then I’ll do it. Do you think I would harm them?""

The next day, I went to the school with my sister-in-law Sophie, only to find our daughters covered in bruises, already lifeless.

But Liam... he was celebrating on social media, announcing that his beloved was pregnant with his child.

I stared blankly at Sophie.

""My children are dead. I have nothing left. Please, let me go. I don’t want anything anymore.""

When we arrived at the hospital, the children already had no vital signs. They were so far gone that they didn’t even make it into the emergency room before being taken to the morgue.

Sophie looked at me with pity, but she still spoke softly, trying to comfort me.

""It’s okay, don’t worry. Grandpa and I are on your side. This time, my brother was wrong. I will make him apologize to you. You’ll be fine from now on...""

Before Sophie could finish her sentence, I handed her my phone.

Liam had posted a status just two hours ago.

""Before you even came into this world, your mother and I had already begun loving you.""

The post was accompanied by a picture of an ultrasound report, clearly marked with the name ""Vivian Cole,"" showing she was six weeks pregnant.

Vivian... Liam's beloved.

Sophie froze, her face flushing with anger as she spoke through clenched teeth.

""I’ll call my brother right now. Don’t worry, we will make sure we get justice for you...""

I smiled bitterly and immediately called Liam. The moment the phone connected, his impatient voice rang through.

""Are you trying to tell me that the kids were abused at school again? Who dares to hurt my children? Stop playing the victim. I just sent them to learn some discipline. Why do you keep calling me? You really disgust me.""

I didn’t say a word, and Liam hung up immediately.

I had the phone on speaker, and his cruel words echoed in Sophie’s ears. Her face turned pale, and her lips trembled, as if she didn’t know how to comfort me anymore.

I forced a smile, but tears streamed down my face,uncontrollable.

""Please, I have nothing left. Let me go. I can't take it anymore.""

Before Sophie could say anything, two police officers appeared in front of us.

""Are you the family of the deceased? The head of the school has already been detained. We need your cooperation with the investigation.""

When I entered the police station, I saw the men who had come to our house the day before to take the children.

In that instant, I lost all control, screaming and crying as I lunged at them.

“You monsters! You fucking monsters! They were five years old! How could you do this to them? How could you?!”

The police quickly pulled me away, and Sophie hugged me tightly, trying to keep me calm.

“Juliette, please—the police will handle this. We won’t let them get away with it!”

The men seemed to shrink in fear, glancing at each other as they sneered.

“Maybe if you’d raised them right, this wouldn’t have happened.”

“That’s just how we teach kids at our school. Spare the rod, spoil the child. Who knew your brats were so weak? What a fucking waste—”

My fingers shook as I pointed at them, my anger building up like a ticking bomb. I wanted to tear them apart!

A sharp taste of blood rose in my throat, and I vomited a mouthful of blood. Everything went black.

When I woke up, I was in the Sterling family mansion and Sophie was sitting by my bedside, her eyes red from crying.

""Juliette, you’re awake? Don’t worry, we’ve already handled things with the police. We won’t let those monsters get away with it!""

I stared blankly at the ceiling.

""Please, let me go. I have nothing left...""

# Chapter 2

I knew in my heart that the men at the school were guilty, but ultimately, it was Liam who had sent our daughters to that hellish place. The true culprit wasn’t those men, but their biological father, Liam.

Sophie flinched, then, as if making a decision, spoke softly.

""Alright, I’ll go tell Grandpa.""

As I watched Sophie walk away, I couldn’t hold back my tears any longer. It felt as though I was crying away all the injustice I had endured over the years.

I had come to the Sterling family when I was eight, the same age as Liam. Mr. Sterling and my grandfather had been comrades-in-arms, and my grandfather had saved Mr. Sterling’s life on the battlefield. They had a bond of life and death.

I had lost both my parents shortly after I was born, and I was raised by my grandfather. But when he passed away, Mr. Sterling took me in.

Over the years, Mr. Sterling and Sophie had treated me as family, genuinely accepting me as one of their own. So, even though Liam was a jerk, I stayed at the family home for seven years, gave birth to his children, and took care of the household.

I had thought that, even if I wasn’t loved, my life had meaning as long as I had my two precious daughters.

But now, I had nothing.

Some time later, Sophie returned to my room.

“Grandpa wants to see you.”

When I walked into Mr. Sterling’s room, he was sitting on a chair by the bed, looking at me with deep pity.

""My dear, you’re such a good girl. I’ve heard from Sophie about all the suffering you’ve been through these years.Tomorrow, the children will be cremated. After it’s over, if you want to leave, then go. That damn son doesn’t deserve you. He shouldn’t have wasted your time.""

I didn’t say a word, but bowed deeply to Mr. Sterling.

As I bent over, tears dropped to the floor like stones. I was grateful, so grateful for their care over the past twenty years. But I could never forgive Liam—the man who had killed my children.

When I returned to my room, Liam was already waiting there. As soon as he saw me, a sneer appeared on his face.

""Well, what is it? Can’t wait to go back and complain to Grandpa? Juliette, do you really think that after you’ve sweet-talked Grandpa and Sophie, I’ll stay with you and live happily ever after?""

Seeing him, my hatred flooded over me like a tidal wave. I wanted to kill him, send him straight to hell!

But then, I heard the soft voices of my children in my mind.

""Mom, we love Daddy so much. He’s the most handsome daddy at our kindergarten.""

""Mom, we miss Daddy. Will he come home today to be with us?""

""We love you, Mom, but we love Daddy second best.""

Even when I rushed to the school to save them, their last words before they lost consciousness were still:

""Mom, please don’t fight with Dad because of us. It’s our fault, we weren’t good... we didn’t listen...""

I took a deep breath, ignoring Liam, and sat down by the bed.

When I didn’t speak, Liam grew angry, grabbing me and throwing me onto the bed. He pinned my hands above my head.

""Now what’s this about? Didn’t you tell Sophie to call me back?""

As he spoke, he leaned down to kiss me, but I couldn’t fight back. I could only bite down on his lip hard.

Liam winced in pain and pulled back, sitting up.

""Juliette! Have you lost your mind? Seeing you like this disgusts me. You must have used that sweet, innocent face to deceive Grandpa, didn’t you? You tricked me into coming back and now you’re playing hard to get? Pathetic. And it’s because of your weak parenting that our daughters turned out so—”

I bit my lip until I tasted blood. Then, softly, I cut him off.

""The children are dead.""

# Chapter 3

Liam’s expression suddenly tightened, and after a brief moment, he scoffed.

""Juliette, you really have no shame. Is this what you’re going to say? You only just found out that Vivi is pregnant, and now you’re making up all these lies?""

After saying this, Liam stood up and walked straight to the door.

Just as he reached the doorway, he paused.

""It’s your own choice, so don’t go whining to Grandpa about how I’ve neglected you. That’ll just make me hate you more.""

Once Liam left, the room grew quiet again. I rushed into the bathroom, scrubbing my teeth furiously, trying to wash away the lingering taste of Liam’s kiss.

Liam and I had once been in love. On the day of my coming-of-age ceremony, eighteen-year-old Liam stood before me, his ears flushed red.

""Juliette , I want to take care of you. I don’t want to just be your brother anymore…”

His cheeks were tinged pink, but his eyes were full of determination, captivating me completely. My heart melted in that moment.

For the following years, Liam treated me like I was the most precious thing in the world, and I did the same, giving him everything I had.

Until that day, when Mr. Sterling called us into his office.

""You’re both of marriageable age now, Juliette . Your grandfather saved my life and I wouldn’t trust you to just anyone. What do you think of Liam?” From that point on, Liam’s attitude toward me changed drastically. The love and tenderness we had shared seemed to vanish overnight.

I had no idea what had happened, and Liam never told me why.

A year into our marriage, I became pregnant. But from then on, Liam barely came home, flaunting his affairs with Vivian in public without shame.

I confronted him, screamed at him—but he only ever looked at me with disgust, as if I were some deranged lunatic.

“You got what you wanted—you’re Mrs. Sterling now, you’ve given the family heirs. What more are you whining about? Stop playing the victim. It makes me sick.”

From that moment, I stopped asking him for explanations. I focused on taking care of our two children.

I accepted the truth—Liam didn’t love me, nor did he love our children. But at least I was lucky that the kids were well-behaved. I thought that if I could just grow old with them, I would be happy.

But now, I had lost them as well.

The next morning, the children were cremated and buried. I stood outside the funeral home, holding two tiny urns in my arms.

They were so small when they were born, quietly lying in my arms. How had five years passed, and they had become even smaller and lighter?

My eyes stung with tears, but I bit my lip to hold them back.

Sophie looked at me with deep concern.

""If it hurts, just cry. Don’t hold it in.""

I didn’t respond to Sophie. Instead, I looked toward Mr. Sterling, who was preparing to leave for the cemetery.

""Grandpa, the children won’t be buried in the Sterling family tomb. I’m changing their last names. They aren’t Sterlings—they’re mine.”

Mr. Sterling gave me a long, hard look before his anger flared.

""Where is that ungrateful bastard? How dare he skip their funeral!”

Sophie glanced at me nervously and whispered, ""His phone’s off. We can’t reach him.""

Closing his eyes briefly, Mr. Sterling exhaled before nodding at me.

""They are your children, born after you risked your life. Do as you wish.""

The Sterlings had raised me. I owed them everything.

But my children owed them nothing. I wouldn’t let them suffer even in death.

After Grandpa left, Sophie gently called me.

"". Juliette...""

I smiled at her, holding the two urns tightly as I took a cab straight back home.

I needed to take the children’s things as well. That house was never a home. I didn’t want them staying in that cold, empty house.

But as soon as I opened the door, the sounds of a man and woman moaning in pleasure filled my ears.

""Oh, the doctor said we shouldn’t… I’m pregnant…”

# Chapter 4

The man’s voice was hoarse, filled with desire.

""I’ll be gentle. It’s fine, sweetheart. How could I hurt our baby?""

Moments later, the sounds of their passionate intimacy echoed through the house.

They were in the bedroom, lost in their embrace. I couldn’t bring myself to go in and pack. I stood there, at the door, listening to those unbearable sounds, torturing myself.

I didn’t know how long it had been, but eventually, the two of them finally walked out of the bedroom.

The moment Vivian saw me, her eyes gleamed with triumph.

“Oh, Juliette! You’re back? Why didn’t you say anything? Liam just couldn’t help himself—what could I do?”

Liam stood beside Vivian, his arm wrapped around her waist.

""Why bother explaining to her? She’s nobody. Let’s go. We have a check-up with the doctor today. Our baby’s health comes first.”

Not once did Liam look at me. His eyes were only on Vivian.

I stepped aside, quietly making way for them.

As they passed me, Liam finally noticed the two urns I was holding.

""What’s that trash you’re holding? Toss it out—it’s disgusting.”

With those words, Liam pulled Vivian away and left the house.

I stood there, staring down at the urns in my arms.

“He didn’t mean you. Don’t be sad. You’re Mommy’s treasures, and you’re not trash.""

After gently setting the urns down, I began packing up the children’s things.

Clothes, toys, dinnerware, and paintbrushes.

When I picked up the little desk from their room, I found a family portrait on it. But in the picture, there were only me and the two girls. Liam wasn’t in it.

I shook as I took the photo out of the frame.

My daughter had drawn a man beside the family, and with childish handwriting, she wrote five words.

""Daddy loves Mommy,"" followed by a small heart.

I couldn’t hold back any longer. I clutched the photo to my chest and sobbed uncontrollably.

For the five years I had taken care of the children alone, no matter what had happened between Liam and me, I had never spoken ill of him in front of the kids.

But children are the most sensitive beings. They could see clearly that Daddy didn’t love Mommy.

By the time night fell, I had finally finished packing up the children’s things. I watched as the movers loaded the boxes onto the truck.

""Miss Hart, is there anything else?""

I shook my head and turned back into the house, placing the signed divorce papers on the coffee table.

As I left the house, I held the two urns tightly, feeling an unexpected sense of calm.

After a long moment of silence, I took out the SIM card from my phone, snapped it in two, and threw it out the window.

Meanwhile, at the hospital, Mr. Sterling and Sophie had arrived to confront Liam and Vivian, who were there for a prenatal check-up.

The moment Liam saw Mr. Sterling and Sophie, his expression darkened.

“How fucking pathetic can Juliette get? Pretending to be fine at home, then sending you two after me? Disgusting—”

Before Liam could finish his sentence, Mr. Sterling slapped him hard across the face.

""You ungrateful wretch! You’ve killed your own children, and now you’re here playing happy family with your whore? How did I raise such a monster?!”

Liam staggered, almost losing his balance.

""What… What did you say?""

I'm 28F and I've experienced iron deficiency symptoms for as long as I remember. As a kid I've never been able to pass any PE tests, as I'd collapse and run out of breath. In my teens I was of average build and I'd struggle with stairs, my friends often needed to wait for me on casual walks because I'd run out of breath. Testing was done, believing it was my heart or lungs, blood tests etc. all came back fine except for iron deficiency.

As an adult I've had tests done again, and once again, iron deficiency, no anemia. Blood count etc all in the green, literally no issues anywhere except for iron deficiency.

I've had iron supplements for 3 months and while after two months (December) I felt actually human for the first time in my life, it went straight back downhill at the start of February when I stopped taking them for a month and a half, as my course ran out.

It felt worse since I know now what it feels like to be okay haha. However my iron has gone up just a slight bit, still way below the minimum however. 

I drink nutritional supplements with lots of iron, eat a lot of red meat, spinach, kale etc, but it clearly doesn't do anything. I have one cup of coffee in the morning and refrain from caffeine otherwise. I'm a bit at my wits end, and the Internet only helps with Iron deficiency anemia. However I've got no anemia and I wondered what possible reasons could be? 

I'd also like to add I've had Celiac tests done and I don't have Celiac disease. No bleeding internally either.
