I only throw leaves, rotted trees and coffee grounds into it because I don't want to attract animals.

I don't have much use for compost, only once a year, in Spring, as top dressing on my tiny vegetable container garden. But I turn it over about once a month when I add new coffee grounds to it. 

So, it's that time of year and I dug deep into the pit and shoveled the rich, loam-like soil onto the strainer. It is probably three years old at that depth. 

I also wanted to use some indoors so I spread it thin in the wheelbarrow, put a clear plastic tarp directly on it and tilted the barrow flat at the sun. I left it there for about three hours.

When I came back, I peeled up the plastic and the soil was hot, surprisingly hot. And I took a handful up and brought it to my nose. It was a sweet and indescribably beautiful smell. Perhaps earthy, perhaps flowery, perhaps a little like rain. It was just wonderful.

**AITA for telling the real reason I’m no longer a bridesmaid**

**Trigger Warnings:** >!infidelity, falsifying statements, mentions arrest for possible CSAM or massive fraud!<

---------------

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/8avJdi1MDT): **April 3, 2025**

I (25f) had been friends with Cammy (25f) since kindergarten when her family moved next door to mine when we were both 6. We have been through everything together and once considered the other as a sister. We both have even moved to the same state to be close to one another.

About two years ago Cammy started dating Andrew (36m) who I did not like. He was a lot older than her and just did not seem like the right guy for her. She once asked me what I thought of him at the beginning of their relationship and I told her my opinion of him being too old, but she told me that everything was fine and that age was just a number. I honestly didn't see anything else bad about him, so I eventually learned to let that go, but always had that uneasy feeling about him.

Eight months ago Andrew proposed to Cammy and she immediately asked me to be a bridesmaid. I said yes and was happy for her. Her wedding was in late February of this year.

In early November, Cammy comes over to my apartment to tell me that she had been actively cheating on Andrew for the past six months with some guy from her work. She told me that Andrew found out and instead of getting angry with her, asked for her forgiveness and wanted to know as to how he could be a better partner to her because he was failing her. She said the reason she was telling me was to go ahead and get it off her chest before I found out from someone else and thought badly of her. When she told me I could tell she had no remorse and didn't even regret her cheating.

I was shocked and asked if she regretted what she did and she said it hurt her to see Andrew so upset, but she explained that things were so ""hot"" at work that the tension was too much for her and her coworker to ignore. I told her that I was no longer going to be a bridesmaid and wasn't going to attend her wedding because I don't associate myself with cheaters and no longer supported her marriage, especially since she did not think what she did was wrong.

Cammy got very mad at me and told me off and eventually blocked me on everything. I never explained to anyone about her cheating for my reason as to why I chose not to go and I made sure to not talk bad about Cammy to anyone who asked because I did consider her to be a sister. We have not talked since that day and I know she and Andrew got married.

Fast forward to last week and I am out with my bf at a coffee shop where I run into one of Cammy's bridesmaids that is also one of her coworkers. She walked up to me and asked how I was and I said fine and told her it was good to see her. She then apologized for being too forward, but wanted to know if Cammy and I ever made up after our ""incident"" before her wedding. Confused, I asked what the incident was and she eventually told me that Cammy explained to the bridal party that I chose to leave because of my feelings for Andrew and that I couldn't see him get married because of how I felt.

I was appalled. Not only did I not have any romantic feelings for Andrew, I never even really liked him! I told the bridesmaid that the reason I left was because of Cammy's affair with her coworker, who she knows as well because they all work together. When I told her that, the bridesmaid said she remembered Cammy and the coworker being close, but didn't know about the affair. She left the coffee shop not long after the conversation and I felt guilty about telling her that since I haven't told anyone. My bf says me telling her that makes it look as if I'm trying to hurt Cammy and Andrew, therefore making it seem as if I do like Andrew.

Aita for telling her that? I don't know if she told Cammy I said that, and I don't know how Cammy and Andrew are doing, but I do feel bad that I shared her business to someone she works with.

**Top Comments**

**Commenter 1:** NTA. You were simply correcting a lie. Cammy didn't need to come up with a lie to explain away your departure from the bridal party. You have every right to defend yourself. I feel sorry for Andrew. Hopefully he will one day realize his worth and accept that his wife's infidelity is not his fault.

**Commenter 2:** It seems likely that you would have kept this Secret forever. Until she did the one thing necessary to bring the story out into the public again.

She had it coming. I could never fault you for doing this.

You were a good person who handled things well. Look for what it's worth she's headed for a divorce sooner or later anyway. Her life is hell. She'll get hers. She's getting it now.

You're a fine person. Carry on.

[Update #1](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/nP702BhQH9): **April 5, 2025 (two days later)**

I feel like whenever I post on here something immediately happens resulting in an update 😂

Cammy’s other bridesmaid, who I saw at the coffee shop, reached out to me last night through Facebook. I’ll call her Jenna. Guess whose mugshot was posted on our local news site? Andrew!

I won’t exactly say what he did, but it involves his work computer, personal computer and phone. So you can make your assumptions from that.

Cammy reached out to Jenna a few nights ago crying saying that Andrew had been arrested while on shift because of what the IT guy found on his work computer.

Jenna decided to tell me because Cammy mentioned to her how I always felt uneasy about Andrew and how she should’ve listened. Jenna asked Cammy why would I cause I was “so in love” with him and that’s when Cammy came clean and told her about the lie and about her affair with their coworker.

Cammy went on to explain that ever since her and Andrew married, Andrew became very physical with her because of her affair. He waited until there was a ring on her finger to really tell her how he felt about the cheating.

I asked Jenna if Cammy said anything about still seeing the coworker while they were married, and Jenna said Cammy is still seeing him, but swears it’s just friendship now. That’s why Andrew was so upset with her.

Jenna did admit to me that she told Cammy she saw me the other day, which made Cammy ask if she’d think I’d be willing to talk to her. Jenna told her that she didn’t know, but could try to see what would happen.

Cammy hasn’t reached out to me yet and I don’t know if she will. I don’t know what I will do if she does. But that’s the update about her for now.

I’ve noticed there were a few people in my last post talking about my bf’s response. To let you know I did ask him about it and he said he was more worried about how it made me look in that moment. I’ll accept that answer for now, but if he acts up, I will definitely think about things. So far he’s been great.

But that’s it hopefully. I’ll probably update if Cammy ever reaches out, but I’m kind of hoping she doesn’t.

**Top Comments**

**Commenter 1:** You had every right to clear your name on a lie that was told about you. Nobody will ever be the AH for that.

Cammy doesn't sound like a good person, so I'd hold her at a very far arms length if she does try to reach out.

**Commenter 2:** Stop wondering if she'll reach out to you and just block her already. Unless you enjoy eating popcorn as you watch her drama unfold, there's really nothing there for you, is there? Can you ever really truly respect her like you did before you found out? 

&nbsp;

[Update #2](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/lZfm3KjGym): **April 16, 2025 (11 days later)**

Cammy reached out to me. I was starting to think she wasn't going to, but she texted me last night asking if we could talk. I responded ""Is this about your husband being in jail?"" And she immediately called me.

She was crying. She kept saying she had no idea Andrew was like that and wished she paid more attention to how I felt about him. I told her that I had no idea he was doing that and am sorry for how he was. She said something about being a ""hot divorcee"" and a few other things about this ""finally freeing her"" as if she wasn't actively cheating on Andrew throughout most of their relationship. She then asked how I was doing.

She didn't even apologize for spreading that lie about me liking her husband!

I asked if we were going to talk about what she said to the bridal party about my absence. She paused, laughed, then asked me if I was really upset over something that wasn't as bad as what Andrew ended up doing.

I just hung up. I probably wouldn't have if I didn't read your comments on my last update saying not to give her the time of day, and you all were right! She does not care about me after all we've been through together.

I blocked her number so I don't know if she tried to reach out again, but I'm done. But that's the update!

**Top Comments**

**Commenter 1:** The trash took itself out. Keep it that way.

**Commenter 2:** Shes an awful person too. Who continues to cheat on their partner, spread lies, and shows no remorse? She should be treated as toxic waste. Good for you for blocking her.

**Commenter 3:** Wow, Cammy sounds like a real gem. Good on you for cutting that toxic friendship out of your life. And as for Andrew, sounds like karma caught up to him. #teamdivorcee

This past Friday, I woke up slightly nauseous (which is pretty normal for me) and went on about my day. Took my meds, had breakfast with a small coffee. I barely drank my coffee and ate breakfast before I began feeling off. I began feeling pretty nauseous and my head felt off (lightheaded). I laid down in bed for a while just to rest and see if I could sleep it off. I wasn't able to sleep, but the nausea just felt like tidal waves crashing over and over. 
After about 45 minutes, I sat up and vomited. I felt some relief from the nausea, but after about 5 minutes, the nausea came back.
Then, I felt the need to use the bathroom urgently. My BM was not extremely loose, but looser than normal.

So I was on vacation and at a coffee shop on the resort I was staying at and one of the employees looked at me and playfully asked me if I wanted to arm wrestle. I said “ehh maybe another time” and he said “okay i’ll hold you to it”. Fast forward to the day after he saw me in the coffee shop again and asked if I was ready. I said ahh okay fuck it, he insisted we do it over the counter where they serve the drinks/food which was pretty low already so I was at a weird angle. About 10 seconds in as I was trying to pin his arm down about an inch from the table, and my arm SNAPPED. Very loud and was rushed to the ER and found it was spiral fracture on my right humerus. I flew home the day after with a Sarmiento brace (I attached a pic) and saw an Ortho surgeon this morning who says that this could possibly heal on its own given the type of break and angle the bone is at. Surgery scares me given the fact that if the radial nerve gets cut in the process that could be a whole new issue that could take a year to recover from. Does anyone else have experience with a break like this that recovered without surgery? If so any advice or tips on how to deal with this?

**What is Tyler Durden - The Blueprint?**  
Alright, so let’s break this down. **Tyler Durden - The Blueprint** isn’t just another pickup guide—it’s more like a deep psychological excavation of the male experience in the dating world. This isn’t about cheesy one-liners or scripts. It’s a multi-layered system of social dynamics, built from years of trial, error, and fieldwork by Tyler Durden, co-founder of Real Social Dynamics. It’s basically the *Bible* for guys who want to master not only attraction but also their own identity and mindset in the process.

**Who’s Behind It and Why Should You Care?**  
Tyler Durden (no, not the *Fight Club* guy, though the name is definitely a nod) is one of the OGs of the pickup world. He’s the mastermind behind Real Social Dynamics and someone who turned years of awkward encounters into one of the most influential dating education systems out there. His take? Seduction is more about *inner transformation* than outer tactics. If you're tired of surface-level advice, **Tyler Durden - The Blueprint** goes *deep*.

**Why Does This Course Hit Different?**  
Because it’s not a course. It’s a *reprogramming*. Seriously. **Tyler Durden - The Blueprint** is like if Tony Robbins and Carl Jung teamed up to teach you dating. It’s structured across 15 “books,” each diving into things like social conditioning, value, congruence, love, and identity. It’s about rewiring the way you view yourself and others so you naturally attract instead of *try* to attract. Big difference. It’s less “tricks” and more *truths*.

**Where Can You Dive Into It?**  
Originally taught at live seminars, it’s now available as a digital product—so you can absorb this next-level wisdom from the comfort of your home (or while pretending to work at a coffee shop). Whether you're chilling on your couch or deep into a weekend self-improvement binge, **Tyler Durden - The Blueprint** fits wherever your personal growth journey is happening.

**When Should You Start?**  
If you’ve ever looked in the mirror and felt like something’s off—not just with dating but with how you move through the world—*now* is a good time to start. This isn't for dudes looking to “hack” women. It's for guys who are ready to understand social dynamics, dissolve their limiting beliefs, and show up as their most authentic selves. The earlier you start, the sooner you stop chasing and start attracting.

**How Does It Actually Work?**  
Each section of the course builds on the last. Tyler takes you through the social dynamics matrix, showing you how things like emotional state, authenticity, congruence, and social calibration influence your ability to connect (with women, sure—but also people in general). There’s a heavy focus on internal transformation—because let’s face it, external game won’t get you far if your inner world is a mess. And don’t worry, it’s not dry—Tyler mixes deep insights with that raw, punchy delivery that keeps things moving.

**Final Thoughts on Tyler Durden - The Blueprint**  
If you’re looking for gimmicks and canned lines, this ain’t it. But if you’re ready to overhaul the way you view yourself, relationships, and the social world, **Tyler Durden - The Blueprint** is a goldmine.

1k5q03w,https://i.redd.it/4q09kc6aciwe1.jpeg,We Shipped Coffee to Hundreds of People This Month! Here’s What Went Wrong (and Right w/ subscriptions),"Dear Rotation Coffee Crew,

Your passion is what keeps this whole project alive. I’m the obsessed founder you signed up for, and behind the scenes I’ve been juggling everything, international bean shipments, customs hurdles, dosing, packing, coding, labeling, all to keep this wild Rotation adventure moving forward.

And now, it is time to level up.

Starting in May, subscription drops will no longer be a mix of whatever happens to be on hand. We are introducing a new standard: exclusive coffees selected only for subscribers. These will not be available a la carte. They will be bold, expressive, and carefully curated to surprise and delight with every delivery.

The April subscription drop (just shipped) came with its fair share of lessons. There was no clear cutoff date, so more people joined after quantities had already been locked in. As a result, we could not fully align the beans to the growing demand. (I want everyone to get same beans in future) It ended up feeling more like a mystery pack than the curated experience I intended. It was not perfect, but it was invaluable in showing me how to do it better.

That is the key. Every release teaches me something, and May’s drop will be five times better.

Staying organized while managing all the moving parts is no small feat. Some folks added subscriptions to their a la carte orders, which caused technical issues. Automated renewal dates misfired. Inventory got tangled. Delays happened. Some bags went out incomplete while I waited for more beans to arrive, but eventually, I had to ship what was on hand to get the first drop out the door. Now I know how to plan ahead with much more precision.

It is all part of the process.

Just 75 days ago, we launched with 10 coffees per drop. Today, we are offering over 150, and in some drops, more than 200 unique coffees. The 4 pack subscription will grow with that same ambition and energy. We are still shaping the chaos into something truly special.

Thank you for being part of this journey. Your support means the world. I would love to hear from you on what do you want to see, taste, or experience next?

**1. The meeting**

Langston arrived first. She moved through the unlit corridor in precise, measured steps, the beam from her pen‑light skimming along doorframes and revealing dust she would never have tolerated a month ago. Inside the conference room she flicked the switch, heard the fluorescents whine, and immediately flicked it off again. “Fine,” she muttered.  Lamps would do. She dragged three desk lamps from side benches, set them at equal intervals around the long oak table, and angled the shades so the light fell in a soft triangle, bright enough to read by, dim enough to keep the new ache between her eyes at bay.

She laid out placards—*DR. LANGSTON / DR. BATES / DR. WEI*—exactly twelve inches from the table’s edge, then placed a government‑issue recorder in the center as though the Department of Health still had clerks to type transcripts. The room smelled of ozone from idle equipment and faintly of juniper from a bundle of berries that one of the other doctors had brought in.  Langston straightened her blazer, smoothed her bun, and tried to ignore the tremor in her fingers. Procedure was a lifeline; if she followed it, the world might still be made of rules.

Bates arrived next, hands in the pockets of a soft gray cardigan that didn’t match any dress code Langston recognized. She paused at the doorway, taking in the name cards and the stiff formality, and a quick, wry smile tugged at one corner of her mouth. “Minutes and everything?” she murmured, voice low so it wouldn’t disturb the hush. “If you’d printed an agenda we could have coffee and pretend the FDA still cares.”

Langston pretended not to hear the tease. “Please take your seat, Meredith. We’ll start when Dr. Wei joins us.”

Bates sat, but not before tilting her lamp a shade lower, making the light warmer on Langston’s starched collar. She folded her arms, woolen boots hooked around her chair legs, and watched Langston with sympathetic curiosity. 

Wei slipped in last, almost soundless, a linen scarf looped at his neck, eyes already adjusted to the dim. He offered Langston a courteous nod, Bates a knowing one, a half‑smile flicked across his mouth before settling into calm seriousness. Wei then sat without ceremony or fidgeting. 

When the recorder’s red light blinked on, the only noise was the soft tick of the distant refrigeration unit and, beneath it, the shared silence of three people who knew they were about to decide humanity’s fate.

**2 The Map**

Langston tugged a tube from her satchel and unscrewed the cap. The sheet she slid out wasn’t paper but thin, flexible Mylar, its surface over‑printed with a world projection and faint latitude lines. She spread it across the table; lamplight gleamed on the coating, and Bates obligingly anchored the corners with four empty beakers.

“Colors, please,” Langston prompted, reaching for a notebook.

Bates lined up a row of self-sticking dots in various colors at the margin of the map. “I scented them to make them more memorable,’ she said, as though that were perfectly reasonable. Wei nodded.  

Langston gave Bates a long look that was nearly a glare, then started placing the dots. 

Lavender dots clustered along the Southeast, then trailed northwest like vines escaping a pot.po Wei leaned closer, nostrils flaring as he sniffed. “Lavender carries linalool,” he murmured, naming the compound. “Appropriate for mapping the reports we are assuming are areas of Attuned. Its calming.”

Sage dots mixed with lavender, but sparser except in areas of business and commerce where they were more  evenly distributed. “And sage is thujone,” Bates said. “Smells sharper, helps me remember the Basic cases.” 

Langston’s pen scratched. “To review for the record: lavender equals confirmed Attuned clusters, sage equals majority Basic, gray pending, black indicates catastrophic ELM death of more than twenty percent of the local population.” Bates gasped as Langston placed black dots in Sub‑Saharan Africa, Uruguay, Estonia and South Dakota in the US. More black dots in every continent, every nation. Tears brimmed Wei’s eyes. 

Langston nodded. “Sources are field interviews, hospital logs, WHO bulletins, and whatever open‑source cell‑video we can still scrape before servers go dark. It’s patchy, but the pattern persists.” 

Wei tapped the eastern seaboard of the United States, now a haze of lavender that diffused inland along railroad spurs. “Washington to Chicago in nine days. The amplitude of spread is faster than even measles prior to vaccination.”

“Because no one is isolating,” Bates said. “They’re calm, not scared.”

She tracked a pen down to Milan. Sage dots mix with  lavender on northern trade arteries, then to São Paulo’s interior, where lavender islands floated in a sea of black. “Explain the Brazilian interior, Helena. Why lavender inside an ELM kill zone?”

“Missionary aid flights,” Langston answered. “They arrived with flour and diapers. Their flight nurse was already Attuned; she breathed in a cargo hold with twenty volunteers.”

Wei smiled faintly. “Charity carries more than blankets.”

Langston pointed to Australia’s rim where two lonely lavender disks clung to the coast. “But here is almost untouched. Airline traffic collapsed after the first wave. We could still keep whole regions Resistant.”

“Resistant or vulnerable,” Wei corrected. “Deaths are still rising in Darwin’s suburbs. If we withhold MIMS, we’re choosing who lives and who doesn’t.”

A silence settled. Only the soft whir of a backup refrigeration unit punctuated the hush.

Langston lifted her eyes from the map. “All right. Scope acknowledged. Next question: do we accelerate, contain, or do nothing?”

Wei folded his hands. “Before we move to that vote, may we agree on one point? Wherever lavender settles, the morgues empty.”

Bates slid the remaining stickers into her pocket. “And wherever black spreads, children are burning with encephalitis.”

Langston’s jaw tightened, but she conceded with a single nod. “Point recorded.”

She closed her notebook with a soft snap. A small staccato sound that was a prelude to the real debate.

  


**3: What They Know**

The stickers in place, Langston pinned the Mylar map to a foam-core board and propped it against the conference room wall. The stickers were starting to curl at the corners—lavender, sage. The black ones clung heavily to the page like bruises. She stood beside it now, notebook open, posture tight as piano wire.

Wei and Bates sat opposite each other, mugs of cooling tea between them. Outside the reinforced windows, the generator thumped like a tired drum. Inside,  the scratch of Langston’s pen filled the room.

“Latency,” Langston began, “averages twenty-four to forty-eight hours. In ELM survivors with lingering immunosuppression, the window can compress to as little as six.”

“It’s possible that it compresses more than that. There are reports of MIMs saving ELM patients who appear to have mild brain swelling at the onset  of the encephalitic phase.” 

Langston nodded, “I’ve heard that too, but at this time its *only* anecdotal.”

“And the active phase?” Wei asked.

Langston turned the page. “Median five hours. Elevated cortisol correlates with compulsive truth-telling, erratic metaphor use, sensory-driven speech, and physical pacing. Then... cessation. Most subjects transition cleanly into a new baseline within twelve hours of the onset of the active phase.”

“No deaths directly attributed to MIMS?” Bates asked.

Langston shook her head. “None. Outcomes are stabilizing. Twenty percent emerge Basic. Sixty-five percent present as Attuned. Remaining fifteen percent are either resistant, ambiguous, or pending final assessment.”

She paused. “And fertility patterns are becoming clearer.”

Wei looked up.

Langston read without commentary: “Basic males are completely sterile. Attuned males show significantly diminished sperm motility. Low, but not zero. Observed sex drive in Basics: negligible. In Attuned: markedly reduced. Birth rate across lavender and sage zones projected to stabilize at twenty-five percent of pre-ELM levels.”

Bates blinked, slowly. “Not extinction. But close.”

Bates looked thoughtfully at Langston and said,  “Looks like the earth gets her reset either way. They die through ELM… or they’re never born at all.”

They considered in silence for a moment before Langston continued, “No aggressive behavior reported. No reproductive coercion. No statistically significant pair-bonding in either group post-transition. Sexual activity drops off almost entirely within the first week.”

Wei exhaled, slow and even. “That might be the most hopeful thing I’ve heard all day.”

Langston moved to the map. She touched a lavender cluster near Atlanta and let her finger trace the spread westward along the old rail lines. “Lavender zones show near-total ELM suppression. Ten days from first infection, mortality rates drop to statistical noise.”

She gestured toward the blackened dots in eastern Europe, inland China, the center of Australia. “Black zones still losing up to twenty-five percent of population, and that number will likely go higher without intervention. Hospitals are overwhelmed. Long-term care units collapsing. Caregivers are burning out.”

Bates tapped the table lightly. “Systems are failing where fear still rules. But where MIMS takes root—”

“Fear drops,” Wei finished. “Caretaking becomes communal. Energy use flattens. No more overconsumption.”

Langston’s lip curled. “Or because half of them are standing barefoot in fields talking to moths.”

Wei shrugged. “Still sustainable.”



**4: The Core Argument**

Langston had resumed her pacing, a habit that had returned since the map went up. Her heels made a soft rhythm on the concrete floor, measured and tight. “We haven’t run long-term cognitive studies,” she said abruptly. “We don’t know what happens to Attuned children at adolescence. For all we know, they could lose executive function, or fail to develop it in the first place. Basic adults may be incapable of abstract planning. Society could stall.”

Her voice didn’t rise, but the edge was there, under the surface and well-controlled.

Wei leaned back in his chair, not in dismissal but in quiet counterbalance. “Society is already stalling,” he said, folding his hands. “ELM is a guillotine falling in slow motion. With MIMS, at least the survivors remain nonviolent, collaborative. Alive. According to their neurochemistry, blissful, even.”

Langston stopped walking but didn’t sit. “And what exactly do we become? Dreamy philosophers humming at plants while the plumbing rusts?”

Bates spoke gently. “History will judge intent. If we accelerate distribution, we’re making a decision on humanity’s behalf.”

Wei didn’t flinch. “And if we do nothing, we’re still deciding. We’ll watch millions die knowing it was unnecessary and because of us. Non-action is still action. Just slower. Don’t forget, MIMs gives individuals a choice.”

Langston bristled. “Choice? Where is the choice in this? Basic subjects didn’t choose docility. We rewired them. You rewired them.” She folded her arms. Bates knew it was her ‘tell’ that she was having difficulty controlling her emotions. 

“The choice,” Wei said, “is internal. MIMS doesn’t impose. It offers. A door appears. Whether someone walks through depends on their architecture. Their wiring. Their will.”

Langston’s eyes flashed. “That’s metaphysics, not science. You have no proof. No data supports any of this.”

For a long moment, no one answered.

Then Bates, still seated, let her fingers drift to the map where a lavender dot overlapped a faded sticker. She brought the tip of her index finger to her nose and inhaled. “The scent is fading,” she said absently. “Already.”

Then, without looking up: “Maybe metaphysics is the only workable model we have left. A leap of faith.”



**5. The Vote, Again**

Langston opened a slim manila folder and withdrew a single sheet of paper: she had created a Tygress Internal Ethics Ballot. The form looked out of place on the conference table now cluttered with scent-marked stickers and handwritten logs. It had the neat lines and checkboxes of another era, one that still believed governance could be printed on 20 lb. bond and filed in a drawer.

*Decision regarding future deployment of MIMs, global scope.*

There were three options, each with a small square beside it.

Langston set the form in the center of the table, aligned precisely with the grain of the wood.

Wei reached for the pen first.

He checked the box next to:  
**Proceed with targeted global seeding.**

He signed beneath it with a firm, slanted hand. No hesitation.

Bates picked up the pen next. Her eyes scanned the form twice before she made her mark.  
**Proceed with targeted global seeding.**  
But before she signed, she added a line in blue ink just beneath:  
**Review quarterly. Cease if deleterious trends emerge.**

She signed her name below that, the loop of her ‘B’ faintly smudged.

The pen lay idle.

Langston stared at the form for a long moment. Her fingers flexed once. Then she placed the pen down without touching the paper.

“Abstain,” she said flatly.

No one spoke. The silence was deep and heavy, broken only by the slow cycling whine of the outdoor generator as it kicked back on, its rhythm like a weary breath.

The form sat in the center of the table, two-thirds complete.

Two-thirds was enough.



**6. Division of Labor**

Wei reached into his shoulder bag and produced two small, dark-glass cylinders. He set them gently on the table and slid one toward Bates.

Miniaturized nebulizers—silent, dry-fog delivery. Each one pre-loaded with carefully suspended doses of MIMs. It looked very much like spray for asthma relief. 

“Temples,” he said. “Pilgrim festivals. Places where reverence still carries weight.”

Bates nodded, pocketing the vial. “Transit hubs,” she added. “Child-vaccination sites. People still trust nurses more than prophets. How many doses are in each bottle?”

They worked without ceremony. Into their linen duffels they packed paper maps, spare clothing, bundles of dried herbs for scent-masking. Inhalers to regulate their breathing during long-haul flights. No electronics. No laptops. Nothing that could be tracked. Only notebooks, worn and stitched with thread, already marked with thoughts they didn’t want a server to know.

When it was time to go, Bates stood at the door with her hand on the frame. She glanced back at Langston.

“Come with us, Helena,” she said. “We need your caution out there.”

Langston stood motionless by the map. Her arms were folded tight across her chest, but her jaw was looser now, her voice quieter.

“Someone has to remain uncommitted,” she said. “To measure what commitment does.”

Wei placed his palm over his heart and bowed slightly. It was half salute, half farewell. “Then listen well,” he said. “The data will arrive on the wind.”

And then they were gone; just footsteps soft on concrete, echoing once in the hall before disappearing into the morning.

Langston stayed behind.

With the maps. With the silence. With the form, unsigned.



**7. Langston’s Line**

The lab felt larger once they were gone.

Langston stood alone among a sea of dark monitors, their blank faces faintly reflecting the soft amber of the desk lamps. The scent of lavender still hung faintly in the air, clinging to the Mylar map like a memory.

She exhaled once, sharply, and her breath shuddered at the end.

Then she turned.

Her heels clicked as she crossed to the comm station, a hulking relic from a time when protocols still mattered. The screen flared to life at her touch, casting sterile blue light across her face.

She dialed.

One number after another.

Every remaining government contact.  
Every pharmaceutical board chair.  
Every think-tank fellow who still owed her a favor from a panel, a grant, a quietly shared tip.

Voicemail.  
Voicemail.  
An out-of-office bounce-back with no return date.

The silence pressed against her ribs.

Then, finally—her fingers hesitated only a moment—she opened the private channel. The one she’d never used. The one marked in red across the top of her internal clearance log.

**DEFENSE EMERGENCY BIO-THREAT ASSESSMENT.**

She entered digitally coded handshake and listened for a tone.

Then a voice that was flat, filtered. “Authorization?”

“This is Dr. Helena Langston, Tygress Biotech,” she said, enunciating each syllable. “My colleagues have left the facility with intent to disseminate an unregulated neuro-active agent across multiple continents. I require immediate interdiction.”

Silence.

Then: “Dr. Langston, confirm agent lethality.”

“Zero lethality,” she snapped. “But total behavioral modulation. That should scare you more.”

Another pause. It was longer this time.

Then, curtly: “Understood. Escalating. Stay where you are.”

The line went dead.

Langston sat back, palms sweating, a faint tremor working its way up her forearms. Her eyes drifted across the empty room. She saw the quiet desk lamps, the now-empty chairs, the thick linen duffel Wei had left behind on the floor, zipped shut like a promise. She drew a breath somewhere between a gasp and a sigh.

The map still glowed faintly lavender on the table. Were the dots a soft constellation of hope, or something worse?

She stared at the exit for a long time.

And then, to no one, or maybe to herself, she whispered, “May history damn the right people.”

She didn’t know yet whether she meant herself.

Or them.

**What is Tyler Durden - The Blueprint?**  
Alright, so let’s break this down. **Tyler Durden - The Blueprint** isn’t just another pickup guide—it’s more like a deep psychological excavation of the male experience in the dating world. This isn’t about cheesy one-liners or scripts. It’s a multi-layered system of social dynamics, built from years of trial, error, and fieldwork by Tyler Durden, co-founder of Real Social Dynamics. It’s basically the *Bible* for guys who want to master not only attraction but also their own identity and mindset in the process.

**Who’s Behind It and Why Should You Care?**  
Tyler Durden (no, not the *Fight Club* guy, though the name is definitely a nod) is one of the OGs of the pickup world. He’s the mastermind behind Real Social Dynamics and someone who turned years of awkward encounters into one of the most influential dating education systems out there. His take? Seduction is more about *inner transformation* than outer tactics. If you're tired of surface-level advice, **Tyler Durden - The Blueprint** goes *deep*.

**Why Does This Course Hit Different?**  
Because it’s not a course. It’s a *reprogramming*. Seriously. **Tyler Durden - The Blueprint** is like if Tony Robbins and Carl Jung teamed up to teach you dating. It’s structured across 15 “books,” each diving into things like social conditioning, value, congruence, love, and identity. It’s about rewiring the way you view yourself and others so you naturally attract instead of *try* to attract. Big difference. It’s less “tricks” and more *truths*.

**Where Can You Dive Into It?**

Whether you're chilling on your couch or deep into a weekend self-improvement binge, **Tyler Durden - The Blueprint** fits wherever your personal growth journey is happening.

This isn't for dudes looking to “hack” women. It's for guys who are ready to understand social dynamics, dissolve their limiting beliefs, and show up as their most authentic selves.

The catch: you don’t initially know who’s who gatekeepers, strong personalities, and overly pedantic peers only reveal themselves over time (often a month+ of interaction).

The politics is much thick and strong across the same leveling. I get it, you are competing for the next opportunities. So people have vested interests. ⁠

I want to come across as **assertive** without feeling **demanding** when I push for the deep system work and architectural context I need to learn the system as quickly as possible.

So far I’ve leaned on building social capital by:

* Open-floor tech syncs
* coffee/lunch chats
* Rapid feedback on docs/PRs
* Donut meetings

Driving decisions and influence based on data analysis is a good point but as a new engineer you don't even know where is what data and what data is missing, who is the owner of the data. ⁠

**Questions for fellow Senior/Staff engineers:**

1. How do you fast-track credibility and influence across teams before you’ve had time to map out the political landscape?
2. What tactics help you manage org politics and diverse personalities without burning bridges? I want to be assertive but I am also very careful at times that this might just burn the bridge so I get little lenient and less demanding. ⁠
3. How do you secure the critical deep-dive work you need (architecture reviews, ramp tasks) while remaining assertive, not heavy-handed? Single onboarding buddy is not very helpful in this case because what I'm looking for is the breadth of the product also the buddy can be unreliable.

**Opening: Marla Nichols**

Marla Nichols was trained to notice patterns. Not in spreadsheets or surveillance footage—she wasn’t that kind of analyst. But in behavior. Missed appointments. Sudden resignations. Mid-level aides who stopped wearing shoes in the office. That sort of thing.

That’s what had made her useful. Once upon a time.

Now, the people above her had stopped returning emails. The people below her had stopped showing up at all.

She stood at the edge of the reflecting pool in Washington, D.C., coat buttoned to the throat, watching a tourist in a Yale hoodie stoop to pick up a candy wrapper. He didn’t throw it away. Just turned it over in his hands like it might reveal something, like it had a secret worth pausing for. Then he set it gently on a bench, as if placing a baby bird.

Marla didn’t react. She reached into her shoulder bag and pulled out a little brown notebook. The cover was soft at the corners and creased at the spine. The last page had been folded twice.

She clicked her pen and wrote:

**Tues AM / Natl Mall**

* tourist picked up trash / stared at it / placed gently on bench
* no phones out
* fewer joggers than usual
* several people standing still / eyes closed (not asleep?)

She paused, chewing lightly on the end of the pen. Then added:

general mood = quiet / focused / …kinda reverent?

That morning on the train, a group of teens had leaned their heads together. There hadn’t been a screen among them. No earbuds, no games. One had started humming a low, steady tone. One by one, the others joined in, layering their breath into complimenting tones like tuning forks. The result was strangely calming and yet almost exhilarating at the same time.

Marla, wedged beside the doors with her badge still clipped to her jacket, had watched them with something close to awe. Teenagers. Sitting still. Without being told.

She’d written that down too:

**metro: group hum = spontaneous?**  
not disruptive  
seemed peaceful  
nobody complained

The government screen on the train still flashed the usual public health alerts:

**ELM ADVISORY**  
wear masks  
report fevers / seizures / rashes

But no one on the train was coughing. No one wore a mask, not really. A few clutched them loosely in their hands. One young woman was using hers as a bookmark. It had been days since Marla had heard of a death in the area.

She closed the notebook and slid it back into her bag.

Whatever this thing was, it wasn’t ELM.

But it wasn’t nothing either.

And no one in charge was talking about it.

**In Milan, the protest had begun like any other.**

Placards bobbed above the crowd. They held aloft anti-corporate slogans, hand-painted outrage, reused cardboard softened by past rain. Chants rose in waves, anger braided with exhaustion. Riot police stood in formation at the far end of the square, armored in black, faces hidden behind visors. The heat shimmered between the two groups like tension made visible.

Each side knew the other would surge into violence at the slightest provocation.

A woman in a green scarf stepped forward. The shoulders of the soldiers tightened. Feet braced. Breath held.

She didn’t raise her voice.

She called three soft, sustained notes that floated into the air like doves released from bondage. Then she stopped.

The silence that followed was startling.

Then someone else picked up the melody. Then another. The sound spread through the crowd like water finding its level.

On the police line, shoulders began to fall. The frontmost officer—a broad-chested man both feared and respected in his battalion—stepped forward.

His body lost its tension. His arms dropped to his sides. His knees bent slightly. Head bowed.

His fingers released the shield, and with a soft sob, he began to cry.

Not from pain.

From something else.

Regret, maybe. Or recognition. Or joy.

The crowd didn’t surge forward. They didn’t cheer. No one took advantage.

Instead, a protestor near the front walked over and handed the officer a bottle of water. He took it, hands trembling, and sat on the cathedral steps like a man who’d walked a long, hard road and finally arrived somewhere he hadn’t known he was going.

They sat side by side.

Other soldiers drifted into the crowd of protestors and embraced them like family returning from war.

No arrests were made.

No demands were shouted.

People simply stayed. Together.

Some sitting. Some humming.

Some with eyes closed and faces turned gently toward the light.

**The Pastor and the Pews**  
In rural Alabama, Pastor Graham stood at the pulpit, sweat collecting beneath his collar. The sanctuary fan spun lazily overhead, stirring paper bulletins and the heavy quiet that had come to define his services lately.

The last three sermons had felt strange. The fire in his voice had faltered. The cadence he once rode like a river now stuttered and stalled. His words had begun to fall into silence—and the silences were louder than the scripture.

He scanned the room.

The pews weren’t full, and those who came no longer called out “Amen.” No hands raised. No polite coughs. Just listening. Deep listening. The kind that made him feel like a child again, staring into his grandfather’s eyes to see if he was telling the truth.

He read from Corinthians.

The words landed flat. The wrong words at the wrong time, like pennies dropped into a dry well.

He looked up at the cross behind him. It had once anchored him but now it filled him with more questions than answers.

He realized he had been silent for many long seconds.

And he had nothing else to say.

So he ended the service with the only prayer he could think of, one he’d learned when he was small:

“Lord in heaven, hear my prayer,  
Keep me in your loving care.  
Be my guide in all I do.  
Bless all those who love me, too. Amen.”

It was quiet when he finished.

After the service, he didn’t linger by the door to shake hands. He went to his office and sat.

His wife brought him a glass of sweet tea.

He accepted it. Then set it down, untouched.

“I think God’s speaking to me different now,” he said.

She didn’t blink. Just nodded, like she’d been waiting for him to say it.

“I think we’re finally listening.”

\---

**The Fall of Firewatch**

They called themselves Firewatch.

Not officially a militia, of course, just “prepared citizens,” mostly men, a few women, all of them once varsity something. They had been fast in high school, strong in college, and still wore their old letterman jackets in the fall. Some could almost still fit in them.

They met twice a month behind the regional library for “training days,” which usually began with formation drills and ended with brisket. Over time, their obstacle course shrank to four tires and a plank, and their favorite maneuver was what they called a “tactical kneel,” which looked a lot like catching their breath.

When ELM hit, they didn’t panic. They *activated*.

The camped at an old minesite in the Montana foothills. The ‘bunker’ contained thirty-two men, three women, and two dogs. Solar panel phone chargers, MREs, a cache of outdated night-vision goggles purchased on Ebay were now useful. They christened the place **Camp Sentinel**, took a group photo for the record, and shut the makeshift gate with a ceremony that involved a bugle solo and a vow to rebuild civilization if it fell.

It wasn’t the virus that broke them.

Not directly.

It was the mist.

One of their men had stopped at an adult store in a strip mall by the highway to buy analog porn on the last supply run.  

A woman had been there, offering “protective blessings” in the form of an herbal mist. Peppermint, pine, and something that tempted behind the scent.

He’d said no and laughed in her face, but he’d stood too close when she sprayed it for someone else.

Two weeks later, Firewatch began to unravel.

At first it seemed like stress. There were minor lapses in radio check-ins. One guy forgot the ammo codebook and another left his boots untied. They chalked it up to “op tempo fatigue,” But the next week, three men skipped the morning drill and were found sitting cross-legged in the generator shed, staring at the patterns of the sun through a mesh panel and humming.

The weeping began that night.

Softly, at first. One man curled in his bunk sobbing over a fifth-grade pet he hadn’t thought of in years. The next morning another admitted he didn’t like shooting and had never liked it. He just liked how people looked at him when he carried a rifle.

Leadership called a meeting and tried to rally the group, reminding them of who and what they hated and why. Drumming up the fear and anger that usually pulled them together. 

It didn’t work. Even a story of illegal immigrants injecting ELM into white babies failed to get more than an, “Oh, dear, that’s so sad.”

By the end of the week, fourteen remained inside, lying on the floors of the tent they called the rec hall and humming in low, overlapping tones. The rest—eighteen in all—walked into the woods without announcement, carrying only water, string, and the last of the Italian seasoning blend.

They did not return.

They had been coming into town regularly for donuts and supplies but no one had seen them for weeks, so a local rancher went to check on them. He expected a shootout. Or a graveyard, but all he found was quiet.

The solar array had been carefully dismantled. The food lockers were unlocked and labeled “take what you need.” The armory was intact and stored neatly,  save for one air rifle which was laid across a folded American flag along with a handwritten note that read: *Sorry about the fence post. Tell Dave I said hi.*

In the mess tent, at the center of the long table, stood a half-carved wooden deer. It wore a garland of braided twine and wildflowers. Around its hooves, someone had arranged a ring of peeled carrots and one boiled egg.

On the chalkboard, beneath a crudely drawn sunrise, was a single line:

***We weren’t meant to be gods. Just good neighbors.***

\---

**A Boy with Chimes**

In a quiet neighborhood outside Seoul, a boy named Min hung wind chimes from every place he could reach.

Plastic ones made from old drink lids which clacked like distant marbles rolling in a drawer. Wooden ones carved from pencil boxes and chopsticks that  knocked softly with the gentle patience of grandfather clocks. One was fashioned from spoon handles and fishing lures which sang in small metallic pings like rain on a tin roof.

He strung them from balconies, porch rails, street signs, and the bent frame of a broken bus stop bench. If he could reach it, it got a chime. If he couldn’t, he stacked crates until he could.

When his teacher found him threading a rusted bottlecap with fishing wire, she asked gently, “Min, what are you doing?”

He didn’t look up.

“I think the air wants to talk,” he said. “And chimes help us hear it.”

That night, just after dusk, the wind came.

First, the breeze nudged the plastic lids and they clicked and clattered like beads shaken in a paper cup.

Then the wood joined in, tapping against itself in soft, syncopated rhythms that made the leaves pause mid-rustle.

Last came the metal: high, clean notes that spun like silver, sharp enough to cut through thought, then ringing out into silence again.

The tones layered and overlapped. \*Clack, knock, chime\*. Then the wind gathered them all at once into a wide, trembling harmony.

The sound wasn’t music, exactly. It sounded like rain in the bamboo mixed with the sound puppies claws make when they run on stones. It sounded like a beaded bracelet on a grandmother’s wrist when she reaches for her first grandchild and sound wet fishing nets make when they drip on the sand. Or maybe they didn’t sound like that at all, but it reminded each person who heard them of forgotten memories and people that were gone and times past.

One by one, windows opened.

Neighbors stepped out in house shoes and blankets. Some cradled mugs of tea that went cold while they listened. Some came with hands tucked in pockets and eyes already damp.

No one spoke.

They stood on stoops and sidewalks and leaned against each other like reeds in the same current.

Tears rolled down cheeks but no one noticed.

The wind quieted after a while. The chimes stilled.

No one moved for a long time, not even the children.

Min sat on the curb with his knees pulled to his chest and a tack hammer in his lap. He didn’t smile like a boy who’d finished a project. He smiled like someone who had finally heard what he’d been waiting for.

The next morning, the neighbors didn’t take the chimes down.

Even the ones strung across laundry lines or clinking against stair rails were left untouched. A few had tangled overnight, and instead of untying them, people just stood beneath them, heads tilted, listening to how the knots changed the sound.

Min walked the street barefoot, the way he always had. He didn’t speak unless spoken to. And even then, his answers were quiet and strange.

When Mrs. Park, who once ran the neighborhood bakery, asked him how he knew where to hang each chime, he said, “The air tells me where it’s thick.”

When Mr. Hwan, the retired mail carrier, handed him a tin full of spare keys and spoons, Min nodded solemnly and whispered, “These will sound like forgiveness.”

By the end of the week, people had stopped calling him strange.

They started calling him **the Listener.**

Not to his face, not exactly. But in whispers, in gratitude.

“The Listener fixed my sleep,” someone said, after a night without nightmares.

“The Listener made my daughter stop crying in her dreams,” said another, who had left a cracked bell on her balcony just in case it helped.

Min didn’t ask for thanks. He didn’t ask for anything.

But neighbors began leaving him little gifts: a jar of honey, a handful of jasmine petals, a pair of handmade sandals too big for him now but meant for later.

No one asked what would come next.

They only waited for the next breeze.

And when it came, the chimes lifted again.

And everyone listened.

\--

**The Billionaire’s End**

He fled early.

Not from illness, since he’d never believed in illness, but from inconvenience, from chaos, from the sound of people asking for things he didn’t want to give. Before the first major lockdowns, before the public figures began coughing on camera, he was already gone.

A Gulfstream jet to a private island and guards with discreet weapons and blank expressions.

He had planned everything.

The bunkers had been dug two years earlier, reinforced with titanium panels and stocked with freeze-dried food, surgical masks, water filters, a backup generator, and an entire pharmacy worth of pharmaceuticals. The island had goats, a greenhouse and a Tesla-branded desalination system.

He’d even purchased a baroque chapel and had it airlifted in from France. The irony of that delighted him. He hadn’t prayed since boarding school but it made for excellent PR during the build phase. His assistant had drafted a press release about ""seeking solitude"" that never got sent.

The guards were loyal. At least, they had been.

For the first two weeks, everything followed protocol. He rotated between workout routines, self-led mindfulness seminars, and private dinners prepared by a personal chef who had once trained in a Michelin-starred kitchen and now made protein powder soufflés.

Then things shifted.

The guards started rising earlier than scheduled. They spent longer on the cliffs, looking out at the sea. One took off her boots and never put them back on. Another began humming tunelessly while polishing the security console.

The chef stopped asking about macros and began serving raw vegetables on ceramic slabs, each plate dusted with crushed herbs and arranged like shrines. She offered no explanation, only a faint smile and a soft, “This is what the food wants to be now.”

He told her to stop.

She nodded, and the next day served a dish of uncut mango with a single spoon and a scattering of flower petals. He threw it across the room.

She didn’t flinch.

One morning, the pilot refused to start the chopper.

“Winds are wrong,” he said.

“There’s no wind,” the billionaire replied.

The pilot shrugged. “Still wrong.”

By the end of the week, the guards had stopped guarding. They sat at the base of the chapel steps, carving driftwood and watching the horizon. One of them sang low, wordless melodies that made the birds circle closer. The chef wore a necklace of string with knots of dried rosemary and smiled at everyone. The pilot planted an arc of tiny seed of something near the airstrip, in the shape of a constellation.

The billionaire screamed at them. He told them they were fired. He threatened to sue them. He said he would ruin them. 

They listened with soft eyes and silence, and then one by one, they walked away.

Left to himself, he paced the bunker, then the chapel, then the helipad. He called old colleagues. No one picked up. He scoured his holdings. Half his servers were down. No one seemed to be stealing anything. No one seemed to want what he had.

On the eighth day of silence, he went to the armory.

He stood alone in the cold, steel-lit room, surrounded by relics of his power. Picked up a rifle. Loaded it with hands that used to sign billion-dollar contracts and took it out to empty island. He fired the rifle once into the empty sky, as if the air might tremble and yield to his will.

It didn’t.

He dropped the weapon and fell to his knees. He said his real name out loud. The name he had carried inside since a child. It echoed in the rafters like something long buried and badly missed.

No one came to arrest him.

No one came to cheer.

He wasn’t a villain. Not exactly. Just a man who thought he could outlive consequence.

Now, he sat beneath the chapel awning, wrapped in the pilot’s old scarf, watching seeds take root in the gravel. The air smelled faintly of thyme.

Later, someone would find the island, and the story would grow. But for now, he stayed quiet.

He hadn’t cried in thirty years.

But today, he did.

\--

**Return to Marla**

Back in D.C., the wind had settled into a warm hush that carried scent more than sound: crushed honeysuckle, concrete after rain, the faint trace of burnt coffee no one had brewed.

Marla Nichols sat on the small balcony of her building’s sixth floor, a wool blanket tucked around her knees and a chipped mug balanced on the railing. Her badge still hung from a lanyard near the door, untouched in days. It could still get her through most government entry points, but fewer and fewer doors opened behind them.

The inbox at her agency terminal hadn’t updated in nearly a week. Internal memos had stopped coming. The emergency coordination thread was silent. She’d sent three emails marked urgent. No replies.

She could still walk through some of the old halls if she wanted. The lights were dimmer now, and most of the elevators hummed but didn’t move. Some stairwells smelled like damp paper and lilacs, which she didn’t question. A former colleague had been sitting cross-legged in the lobby, eyes closed, gently polishing a single doorknob with a handkerchief.

Marla hadn’t interrupted.

She’d just logged the observation, nodded, and gone home.

The streets outside weren’t empty. They were full of presence. People sat on benches without phones. Children sketched symbols on the pavement with crushed petals. A man knelt by a planter and whispered something into the ivy.

Nothing was efficient.

But everything was alive.

Marla opened her notebook, but didn’t write.

Instead, she stared at the last page. It was creased, ink-blotched, filled with small scrawled moments. She looked at them and thought about what her job had once been: noticing what didn’t fit. Flagging the aberrant. Charting the anomalies.

And now? Now everything was an anomaly. And none of it felt wrong.

She looked out over the city, watching as the sunlight bounced off an abandoned office tower and struck the nearby sidewalk like a thrown coin. Someone stopped to pick up the light.

Marla smiled faintly. “The shape of the world is changing,” she whispered.

Her notebook stayed closed, but her eyes that were so trained, so patient, so hopeful, now were open.",1,1745380045.0,prereadmybook,0,1.0,False

Each group will have a maximum of seven songs as we don’t want to go over a full week, which also explains why there may not be some of your favorite number-named songs. (I limited it to maximum 2 songs per artist.)

The goal is to eliminate the songs that you don’t believe are worthy enough for the #1 spot. Upvote to eliminate, Downvote to keep. 

Our songs that have yet to be eliminated are:

Champagne Problems - Taylor Swift

Espresso - Sabrina Carpenter

Red Wine Supernova - Chappell Roan

Coffee - Chappell Roan

Diet Pepsi - Addison Rae.

Kali parted Zuri’s hair with practiced fingers, warm light streaming through the window. The faint smell of leave-in and hair oil mixed with coffee and the hum of an old soul record spinning in the corner. Zuri scrolled absently through her phone, thumb hovering, but she wasn’t really looking at the screen.

“So,” Kali said, voice casual but sharp as always, “band practice again today?”

Zuri nodded. “Yeah. John wants to run through that new set.”

Kali’s eyebrows lifted just enough. “Mmm. John always wants to run something by you.” She caught Zuri’s eye in the mirror and smirked. “He got a little crush, or what?”

Zuri rolled her eyes, but couldn’t help the curve at the corner of her mouth. “Stop. He’s just focused.”

“Focused,” Kali echoed, drawing out the word. “Girl, please. That man’s got tunnel vision whenever you walk in. You see the way he be watching you play? If I didn’t know better I’d say he learning your chords just so he can play your heart.”

Zuri laughed, shaking her head, but Kali pressed on, a wicked grin blooming. “You like it though. Don’t even try to front. You always wear your good earrings on rehearsal days. Don’t think I don’t notice.”

Zuri smacked her leg, giggling. “Kali, you need to mind your business and focus on this braid.”

Kali just winked, her hands working fast. “I am. But don’t pretend you wouldn’t let him mess it up a little if he asked nice.”

Nothing big. The hallway light was off when he got up to use the bathroom. He was almost certain he’d left it on. But maybe not. Maybe he’d just thought about it and never actually flipped the switch. It was late. He was tired.

Then the garage door was open. Wide open. He hadn’t even gone outside the day before. He stood at the doorway for a while, trying to remember locking it, trying to picture himself turning the key. He couldn’t. But memory gets fuzzy. That’s normal. That’s what he told himself.

Soon, it was something new every day. A drawer left open. A shirt in the laundry he didn’t remember wearing. Water running in the bathroom when he hadn’t been in there. He started checking the locks before bed. He started writing little notes to himself.

One evening, he walked into the kitchen and found a man standing by the sink.

“Who are you?” he asked.

The man turned around, calm. “I live here.”

Panic crawled up his spine.

“No, you don’t.”

The man just walked past him, didn’t even look twice.

He didn’t sleep much after that.

The next morning, all the picture frames were different. Not just rearranged, the actual photos. New people. Strangers. A child he didn’t recognize smiling at a woman he’d never met. He stared at it for a long time, waiting for the memory to come.

It didn’t.

Then came the morning when he woke up and the entire house felt wrong. The air smelled off. The floors seemed too cold. The hallway was longer than it should’ve been. The sofa wasn’t where it was supposed to be. He opened cabinets and didn’t recognize the dishes. The silverware was too heavy.

He sat down in the middle of the living room and stared at the walls like they might move if he watched long enough.

A knock at the door broke the silence.

A woman stepped in, clipboard in hand, gentle voice.

“Hi. I’m with home care. Your daughter called. You’ve been confused lately.”

He looked at her.

She spoke slowly. “You’ve been showing signs of dementia. But it’s okay. We’re here to help.”

He turned back to the living room.

He didn’t know this place. He didn’t know the couch. Or the photos. Or the air. It wasn’t his.

But everyone else was so sure it was.

And that was the worst part.

- More text-based (so if you're not a big fan of texting, I might be the person for you) 
- Allergic to phone calls, but not entirely opposed to it
- Can fire out loads of paragraphs, depending on the context 
- Has ""hidden"" expectations towards people (expecting you to put in the same effort in talking, so on) 
- Not the best as consoling emotionally

Just a PSA, I don't want anyone getting hurt. **(Edited to remove identifying information about any of the individuals mentioned).**

If you don't know already, Charlie Kirk is this alt-right, Christian nationalist grifter who comes to college campuses and farms content ""debating"" college students. He has these clubs across campus called ""Turning Point USA,"" who have been recently advertising his soon arrival at SFSU. While walking through the other tables after getting free pizza, I ran into a person who had been talking to the table for about 20 minutes. I leaned into him and said ""Charlie Kirk directly told a black child that the Civil Rights movement was a mistake on camera. If that isn't enough for these guys, I don't think arguing with them will do any good.""

There were 3 people at that table. Lets call them **Person A**, **Person B**, and **Person C**. **Person A** said something along the lines of ""I don't agree with that, that's not good."" **Person B** disregarded the comment completely and continued the table's outreach. **Person C** started getting really heated and stanced up, violently threatening me. I was already about 20-30 feet away, and honestly I was more embarrassed for him than anything else at first. He kept flexing and yelling things like ""do you see a difference between you and me?""

I'm not the biggest guy physically, but I am **not identifiably taller or shorter** than him, so I responded ""about a foot."" I am not too proud of this encounter. I should not have made an emasculating comment based on his stature **or lack of stature**, but I think that sent him over the edge.

I walked away into the library for some Peet's coffee, which was my plan this whole time, and he soon followed me into the library. I'm not sure what his plan was, to fight me in the library or what, but we ended up both getting in line for coffee. I kind of side-eyed him to see what he was up to, and he was already staring at me and just fuming. I asked, ""are you the guy who was trying to fight me outside?"" (He had taken off his sunglasses and he was holding his hat, so I wanted to be sure I had the right person). All that did was rile him up further, and he started saying stuff like, ""little b\*\*\*\* I would have decked you if I wanted to p\*\*\*\* a\*\* b\*\*\*\*"" right in front of the baristas.

I felt super awkward and embarrassed, I felt awful for the baristas who were put into that situation of having to sit there while some insecure man started threatening me, but most of all, I felt really bad for the guy. He went off, ate at a table alone, and just kept staring at me until he left.

I don't know if this guy is a student, an employee of TPUSA, or what, but definitely watch out for him. He's a bit unstable, and I don't want anyone to actually get hurt if he ends up making more than empty threats.

I ended up telling campus security soon after it happened, and all they said they could do was ""keep an eye on him.""

Edit: **Person C**, if you're reading this, don't just try to fight anyone who calls out racist comments. That's a really fast way to get expelled from SFSU, and I so desperately want you to get some form of education. Good luck out there!

1k5pfli,https://www.reddit.com/r/deepnightsociety/comments/1k5pfli/the_copy/,The Copy,"I recently bought an old Victorian-style home out in the middle of nowhereville, Kentucky. I had to move for work—reassigned and yanked from Oregon to the land of tobacco barns, gun stores, and sweet tea. I expected the worst. I figured I’d be surrounded by stereotypical “Deliverance” extras.

I was wrong. Everyone’s been weirdly kind. Too kind.

The neighbors bring over baskets of eggs, garden vegetables, casseroles. Mrs. Jean—an older woman with a weathered face like sun-dried leather—drops by weekly, always smiling, always watching. They treat me like a lost puppy who wouldn’t survive without them. I brushed it off. “Southern hospitality,” I told myself.

That was before she asked me:

""Have you noticed anything odd around the house?""

""Seen any of the previous owner's things?""

Then I asked her: “What happened to the previous owner?”

She paused. “No one really knows. He started acting... off. Then he just vanished. House went up for sale not long after.”

Weird, sure. But not paranormal, right?

That night I searched the house. I found things—things I couldn’t remember buying. Strange knick-knacks. A coat I would never wear. A comb with hair still in it that definitely wasn’t mine.

Then I found the map.

Hand-drawn. Scribbles like a child’s drawing but too detailed, too... deliberate. A red mark in the basement.

I hate the basement. The light down there flickers, like it's underwater. The shadows don’t move with you—they linger. Still, I went down.

There it was. A VHS tape on the old workbench.

STEP 1: OBSERVE

I took it upstairs and popped it in.

The tape was grainy, black-and-white. Then I saw myself—on move-in day. The footage jittered. Static screamed for a second, then cut to another scene: me cooking dinner. Cut. Me brushing my teeth. Cut. Me... on the toilet.

But something was wrong with the angles. These weren’t camera placements I set up. Some were impossibly low, others looked like they were watching from inside the walls.

My eyes stayed glued to the screen. My expression was always blank. Vacant. I watched myself chew in slow motion, eyes locked ahead at something just off-screen.

Cut to black.

That night I locked every door, window, cabinet, and drawer. I didn’t sleep.

The next day, a second tape sat on my kitchen counter.

STEP 2: LEARN TO MOVE

I watched it.

Dark basement. One dim, jaundiced bulb barely lighting the frame.

Something stumbled into view.

It resembled me, vaguely—but its skin was too tight. Bones jutted out at the wrong angles. The thing jerked forward like a marionette with half its strings cut. Its joints hyperextended, elbows folding backward before snapping into place. Knees buckled with a crack that echoed like a tree limb breaking.

Its hands dragged along the ground, knuckles raw, skin hanging in shreds from where it had tried to walk like a man but failed. Its jaw hung open too far—unhinged—and with each failed step, it made a sound like broken glass shifting in a bag.

The scene cut—again and again—each time the creature moved more smoothly. Each time, its form was closer to mine.

And its face...

The eyes were too wide, irises trembling as if vibrating. No lids—just stretched skin. Its mouth curled into a smile too wide, revealing teeth not like mine but rows, filed to thin points. Its tongue lolled from the side like a dog's, black and wet.

It looked directly into the camera.

I slammed the tape eject and tossed it across the room.

That night, I didn’t sleep again. At sunrise, I heard my voice on the other side of my bedroom door:

“Damn, I’m late for work.”

I ran. Out the front door, into the fields. I didn’t care where I went—I just needed to breathe.

When I returned hours later, shaking and dehydrated, there was a third tape.

STEP 3: THE VOICE

I pressed play.

It started with my voice: “Spendy,” “To the coast,” “Man, I miss Stumptown coffee.”

The people around here wouldn't be caught dead speaking that way. They say things like “Bless your heart.” “Hotter than a two-dollar pistol.”

Then came the basement footage again.

The thing was sitting in the corner, rocking back and forth. There was no sound at first—just the hum of static and that awful flickering light.

Then it started to speak.

Its voice was wet, bubbling, like someone forcing air through a collapsed lung. It gurgled my name. It called my mom’s name. It said things I had whispered to myself when alone—things I never said out loud. It began laughing, too loud, too shrill, teeth clacking like castanets.

Then it said: “It’s time.”

It stood up and walked into the light.

It looked like me.

But the skin was too pale, like it hadn’t been exposed to sun in years. Its eyes—too wide, sclera yellowed. Its lips curled unnaturally, stretching back so far the flesh around the corners of its mouth split and bled. The nails were purple-black, jagged, digging into its palms. Its tongue darted in and out like a snake’s.

I heard a creak behind me.

Without thinking, I ran—up the attic stairs, slammed the door, yanked the ladder up, locked it from the inside.

In the attic, I found a shelf. Old boxes. And on the shelf, VHS tapes.

BEN
JACOB
DAN

A few more. Blank. Waiting.

There was also a camcorder—still warm.

I popped in DAN. Watched as the same nightmare unfolded.

Same tapes.

Same steps.

Same ending.

I stood up and went to calm myself down but it just happened SO fast. I just thought I was dying. Like fully convinced that was it. Just absolute impending doom and I couldn't stop it. 

It only lasted like less than an hour, but it was so intense. I was fine the rest of the day and today, but I can't stop thinking about. It felt like I was legit fighting off death... no specific symptoms, just crazy impending doom.

1k5peh5,https://www.reddit.com/r/MA2A/comments/1k5peh5/getting_started_with_competitions_in_massachusetts/,Getting started with competitions in Massachusetts,"# Intro

>Competition shooting is a great way to test your skills, improve your shooting (particularly drawing from a holster) and have a lot of fun. If you're capable of following the safety rules, have a gun and minimum equipment *(more on that in the next section*), the financial means to support the hobby, and have a positive attitude, you can compete. All skill levels can benefit from competitive shooting, and all skill levels are welcome at most matches. You don't need to be crazy fast, in amazing shape, or have any sort of high-end setup. I can't stress how much fun I've found competition shooting, and how easy it is to get started.

>I'm going to focus on action pistol and 2-gun shooting because it's what is most common. There are other types of competitions out there, such as 3-gun, Steel Challenge/Speed steel, PRS, NRL-22, and bullseye shooting (*or any of the NRA matches*), but I'm not going to talk about them here. 

>Most matches are posted on Practiscore: [https://practiscore.com/](https://practiscore.com/) An account is free, and you can use their map to find matches near you. Note: *It can be confusing, because the same club may host 6 different types of match, and that means there will be 6 little icons on the map at the same spot. Find the match format you’re interested in, and check when the next match is happening. There’s usually online signup, and you’ll have to read the rules to know what division your gun/gear puts you in. If you screw up something, don’t worry, they can fix it at the match!*

# Match Sequence

>For most matches, you’ll arrive at the range and put your belt at your vehicle or at check-in after you pay the match fee. This does NOT mean to holster your pistol. Instead, bring your pistol in a bag, and you’ll holster it at a “safe table"". No ammo handling is allowed at safe tables. In all places, that means no ammo handling but others means no ammo on your person (belt, pockets, etc), or even within 3’ of the table itself (including bags). Once you’ve got an unloaded pistol in your holster, you are not allowed to handle the pistol AT ALL unless you’re at a safe table (*again, no ammo on your person or maybe at all*), or at the start position under the direction of a Range Officer. You can go to the safe table to check your optic, work on your gun, or take practice draws. If you’re shooting 2-gun, your carbine will need to be bagged or have a chamber flag in it at all times unless you’re on the line or at a safe table. You’ll also need to sling it or have it in a cart. You can load your mags everywhere but the safe table. I would recommend loading immediately upon arrival, and immediately after you shoot a stage. Once you’re geared up, you’ll have a safety briefing from the Match Director (MD). **Listen to the briefing**. Every range and club has different rules. Feel free to ask questions.

In general, you’ll get disqualified if you:

* Handle a firearm anywhere other than a safe table or on the line under the RO’s direction
* Drop a loaded firearm
* Have a negligent discharge (in the dirt, while moving, or over the berm)
* Have your muzzle break the 180° rule (More on that later).
* Fail to follow the RO’s instructions (Stop means STOP and take your finger out of the trigger guard)
* Note: Individual clubs or ranges may have additional rules.

>You’ll be shooting in a squad with 8-15 other shooters. There are 2 key people in every squad: The RO (Range Officer) who controls the range, operates the timer and is watching the shooter for safety. They (and only they) issue the commands on the shooting line. 

>The Assistant RO, who usually has a tablet and does the actual entering of scores at the end of a stage. They’re also watching for penalties like shooting outside a shooting area, dropping loaded mags in IDPA, or procedural penalties like shooting out of order. They’re also watching for safety violations.

>Each stage will have an array of cardboard and steel targets, and should have a writeup stapled to the table or a barrel or somewhere. You should read this writeup for several things: number of targets, number of hits required, and any procedures that you’ll need to follow. The RO should give a stage walkthrough, including showing you what any dynamic targets look like when activated. In some formats, shooters can do individual walkthroughs (with finger guns), but in others, this is not allowed. Each cardboard target usually requires 2 hits, and steel must fall (or take 1 hit).

>The RO will call the order. Shooter, on-deck, and “in the hole”. If you’re new, tell the RO, and they’ll bump you to the end of the order so you can watch everyone and learn the basics. They’ll call “Range Hot, Eyes and Ears” which lets everyone know to don their eye and ear protection. The shooter comes to the line, and the RO will say “Load and Make Ready”. The shooter will unholster their pistol, load it (including potentially topping off by inserting a mag, racking the slide to load a round, and then swapping to a full mag), and can take some time to make sure their optic is on and functional, take a sight picture, and get ready. Once they’ve holstered the pistol, the RO will say “Shooter Ready?”. The shooter affirms this by saying “Ready” or nodding. The RO will then hold the timer up next to the shooter’s head, and say “Stand By”. They’ll click the start button on the timer, which will emit a loud BEEP, and the shooter’s brain goes blank because that’s what happens… In any case, the shooter moves through the stage, shooting targets as accurately and quickly as possible until they’re done (or are stopped). At that point, the RO will say “If finished, Unload and show Clear”. The shooter then removes the magazine from the pistol, stows it (don’t try to hold it awkwardly in one hand and keep going), and then pulls the slide back to show an empty chamber. The shooter should look to verify that they have an empty chamber. When the RO sees that the chamber is empty, they’ll say “If Clear, Slide Forward”. The shooter will release the slide. The RO then says, “Hammer, Holster” or “Trigger, Holster”. The shooter then drops the hammer or pulls the trigger, and holsters the pistol. The final command is “Range is Safe”. At this point, everyone other than the on-deck and “in the hole” shooters should walk forward to assist in scoring and pasting/resetting targets. The RO and ARO will walk through the stage scoring the hits on targets. The RO will usually announce the stage time at the beginning of the scoring walkthrough. Each target will be scored according to the rules for the match being shot. Once everything has been scored, all holes taped/pasted, and all steel and dynamic targets have been reset, the process repeats with the next shooter. Once every shooter on a squad has shot the stage, the squad will move to the next stage. Once the squad has completed all the stages, they’ll usually be asked to help break down the stage they just shot, and head home. Scores are usually posted to Practiscore within a few hours, or your local club may post them online or email them to participants.

>The 180 Rule: This is a line that’s parallel with the end of the shooting bay and moves with you as you move through the stage. This is why you’ll see people running awkwardly pointing the gun down range. Some stages will have you retreating, and it’s critical that you don’t break the 180 during a retreating movement or during reloading. 

# Equipment 

>The minimum equipment for a pistol match is ear/eye protection, a functional handgun in 9mm (or larger, but most people are shooting 9mm), 3-4 magazines, a belt, a holster, a couple of mag pouches, and \~200 rounds of ammo. You'll need a bag to carry your great from stage to stage. That's it! I've seen people shoot a match with an M&P Shield and 5 8-round mags in their pockets. That's definitely not a recommended setup, but they made it work. 

>There are some additional items which are great and will make your day on the range nicer. A mag loader, spare mag or two, and a cleaning kit are always handy. Spare batteries for your ears and optic are often needed (if not by you, then others). Some people bring a spare gun in case they have a problem. Gloves are great for resetting steel or working on targets. Medical gear is usually provided by the range officers, but plenty of folks carry their own either in their bag/cart or on their belts.

>As far as personal items go, a water bottle, sunscreen, and a wide brimmed hat are pretty much required in the summer, and a rain jacket is always smart thanks to New England weather. In the winter, warm gloves, a good jacket that you don't mind getting dirty, and a thermos of coffee/tea make a long day of sitting around much more tolerable. 

>

>You'll see people with decked-out carts, umbrellas, battery powered fans or heaters, and all sorts of equipment. 

# Organizations 

* **IDPA** \- International Defensive Pistol Association [https://www.idpa.com/](https://www.idpa.com/)

>10-round magazines everywhere (which levels the playing field across state lines), concealment required (often the stereotypical fishing vest), tactical priority (targets must be engaged from near to far and in an order that limits the shooter’s exposure from behind cover), you can’t drop loaded magazines, generally skews older, often weird “scenarios”. If you’ve seen a stage where you have to kick over a chair or throw an axe or drop  a bag on an activator, you’ve probably seen IDPA. No “Duty” gear unless you’re LEO or Mil. Only recently started allowing AIWB holsters and flashlights. IDPA uses Time Plus scoring, where your stage time has “points” added for each imperfect hit, penalty, or miss. Targets are reasonably large. Accuracy is arguably more important than speed, because hits outside the 0 zones add significant penalties.

* **USPSA** \- United States Practical Shooting Association [https://uspsa.org/](https://uspsa.org/)

>Much fewer restrictions on equipment or magazine capacity, more focus on speed rather than accuracy, different targets, and “Hit Factor” scoring, which is points/second. No restrictions on reloading, targets can be engaged in any order unless specified in the stage briefing, and no concealment is required.

* **PCSL** \- Practical Competition Shooting League [https://www.pcsleague.us/](https://www.pcsleague.us/)

>The new guy on the block. Different targets with a “T” head zone which counts as all 10 points in a single shot, otherwise mostly similar to USPSA (Cue the purists screaming in the comments). Hit factor scoring, no mag capacity restrictions, and fast shooting is the norm.

**Massachusetts Specific Information**

>While USPSA and PCSL have no magazine restrictions, it is wise to follow MA state laws. Remember the storage laws when driving to matches, and if you’re using preban mags, remember that they now have to be unloaded during travel. You’ll probably see people using postban magazines at matches. I’m not going to tell you what to do, I’m not a cop.

**Venues in MA:**

>There’s likely a match within 30 minutes of everywhere in the state. Here are a few that I know are solid groups:

* Holbrook Sportsman’s Club
* Rod and Gun Club of New Bedford
* MetroWest Tactical (Harvard Sportman’s Club)
* Bass River Rod and Gun Club
* Monument Beach Sportsman’s Club
* Marshfield Rod and Gun Club
* Old Colony Sportman’s Association

# Summary

>Go shoot a damn match. It’s a blast, the people are generally friendly to newcomers, and you’ll see where your skills are lacking. Ask a squadmate to record video with your phone and yell at yourself for being slow or missing easy shots. I’ve been shooting competitions for 2 years now, and I’ve seen my pistol shooting improve dramatically. I’m nowhere near the top of my local competition group, but I have a lot of fun and really enjoy the sport. Remember that you’re mostly competing against yourself. I tell everyone that their goals for their first match should be:

1. Don't get DQ’d. This includes shooting someone or yourself.
2. Have fun.

***No one is going to give you shit for going slow and being safe. The speed will come with time and experience.***

Before starting the story I know I am mostly in the wrong here;

I became a co-owner of a friends coffee place 2 years ago. Small cash down and sweat equity for the rest with an end of accrual of sweat equity in three years. Agreed final % at the end. 

Anyways, his place was losing a lot of money because of poor choices in GM’s. It was a good opportunity for me because I knew what needed to be fixed etc. Anyways, there was a worker already there that I thought could be a good GM but needed work. I had been laid off from my full time job at the time and took the offer. I personally decided she should be the GM going forward and I’d train her and build her up over time into the role. She agreed and so the work began. 

We started building up a good friendship during this. My partner lives far away so is not around, leaving me to the day to day while I train her. There was some sexual tension between us but I knew, that never ends well and I also was in a long term relationship with a girl I wanted to marry. So I did not do anything. Obviously enjoyed the attraction though (who doesn’t like feeling attracted by another). 

A couple months in, my grandma went into hospice. She died not long after. 2 days later my mom died suddenly and unexpectedly. We weren’t super close but it was my mom nonetheless. The day my grandma died my long term of many years girlfriend broke up with me. We were having issues. Some mine - some hers. I should have seen the signs, but, love makes us blind. She left and moved out. 

Three significant losses in a matter of three days. I always considered myself strong and have been through a lot but this broke me. Being honest here, since no one will know me, I was more pained and hurt by my ex than I was by the deaths. I love both members of my family but this was what I thought the love of my life. So in a nutshell THAT breakup (the one that changes everything). Side note: I understand why some say a breakup can be worst than the death of someone close. I know this very well now. 

During this time I got hired to go back to full time work while I also was still over seeing the new GM and operations at the coffee place. To give context to my mental anguish through the next 4-5 months (it’s important) I lost my full time new job because I couldn’t work. I was a sad excuse for a guy in the fetile position everyday. Mostly due to my ex leaving and feeling the impact of my mom. 

So while in the anguished state of not being able to work and not showering etc etc my GM and me got closer, she had been through something like this before and was trying to help me through. One thing leads to another and we are now being physical, with me lying and being deceitful that I was over my ex (I thought protruding outwards would make it real on the inside). I hadn’t been through this type of breakup yet. I didn’t understand rebounds and all of that etc. 

I still lied tho and over the next 4-5 months I slowly realized what I had done and the hurt that I had caused her (she figured out I wasn’t really over my ex). Let alone the imbalance of power at the coffee shop I put her in. Wrong, wrong, wrong.

I didn’t want my partner to know (I take great pride in my reputation) so we agreed to move back to being friends and trying to separate the shop from personal. As I’m sure you guessed, that didn’t work out well over time. It took a year of sometimes fighting because she was still hurt and wanted a real relationship with me and I essentially had strung her along and wasn’t ready (Don’t do this to someone, I wish I understood where I was emotionally/mentally, it’s a horrible thing to do to another). I apologized profusely for this, many times. I was wrong and hurt her. 

As decisions had to be made over the next year at the shop, if I didn’t make the decisions she wanted she would take it personally because of the relationship we had. I failed at trying to solve that problem and the arguments kept boiling up until 2 weeks ago, when we got into another yelling match. She got off the phone with me and called my partner and told him everything. 

Now he is upset (rightfully so) that I hid this from him. I accept that. He would like to make it work with the three of us. 

While I was wrong and very much so at the beginning I also feel betrayed by her. There could have been a better way to resolve the issue. Like going to my partner together and working through it. Versus her going to him in hysteria.

I don’t know if I have the right to feel betrayed but I do. I did do a lot for her as well. I didn’t want to minimize the harm I have caused her and prop myself up by listing all of it earlier. But, I did try and make it right and do a lot for her professionally and personally through the year of fighting before she disclosed everything to my business partner.

He wants us three to get on a call and flush this out. Which right now I’m still very angry and feel betrayed by her and have told him I am pondering leaving the business entirely. I have to make a decision by the end of the week. I am struggling to want to speak with her because I feel betrayed but I do accept and understand I betrayed her first. 

Am I a horrible person? I made a mistake, yet I have a hard time forgiving her when I’m mostly in the wrong every which way to Sunday. 

Some will probably say pride or got caught with your hand in the cookie jar. 

Maybe that’s true. Iv learned a lot from this whole ordeal. Accept the accountability and will do much better in the future (I do not date anyone as I know I’m still not ready and never want to put someone through that anguish again). 

Am I wrong for feeling betrayed by her for telling our secret to my business partner the way she did?

**What’s the Buzz About the Ipsalu - Bodhi Avinasha - Firebreath Orgasm for Individuals and Couples?**

Let’s talk about energy. Not the coffee-fueled kind, but that deep, buzzing, sensual current flowing through your body—the kind that transforms your relationship with yourself *and* your partner. That’s what the **Ipsalu - Bodhi Avinasha - Firebreath Orgasm for Individuals and Couples** is all about. This isn’t just a course; it’s an invitation to tap into your full energetic and orgasmic potential using a powerful breathwork technique known as the FireBreath Orgasm or Seven-Chakra Orgasm.

**Who’s This For, Really?**

If you’re someone exploring tantra, sacred sexuality, or just plain ol' curious about leveling up your inner alchemy, this is for you. Whether you're solo or partnered, beginner or seasoned energy explorer, **Ipsalu - Bodhi Avinasha - Firebreath Orgasm for Individuals and Couples** meets you where you are. Pre-orgasmic women (those who’ve never quite hit that full-body ""YES!"") will find this especially powerful. And for couples? It opens up a whole new realm of intimacy, beyond the physical.

**What Even** ***Is*** **FireBreath Orgasm?**

Great question. It’s a guided breathwork practice that draws earth and sexual energy up from the base chakra and moves it through your whole energy system—all seven chakras. Think of it like an internal rollercoaster ride that clears blocks and awakens deep bliss. The CD features a rhythmic, meditative soundtrack while Bodhi Avinasha’s voice leads you through the process step-by-step. It’s as soothing as it is electric. The accompanying booklet gives you context, safety tips, and deeper insight into why this works.

**Where Can You Do It?**

Honestly, anywhere you’ve got a bit of privacy and space to lie or sit down. Your bedroom, a cozy meditation corner, or even a quiet beach (if you're bold). All you need is the CD (or the digital version), your breath, and your openness to surrender to the process. This isn’t a one-time thing, either. It’s a practice—a ritual you can return to again and again.

**When’s the Best Time to Dive In?**

There’s no strict schedule, but evenings are usually ideal. That’s when your nervous system naturally starts winding down, and you’re more receptive to deep inner work. Also, syncing it with your partner can become a shared ritual that builds energetic intimacy over time.

**Why Does This Matter?**

1k5p976,https://www.reddit.com/r/GeminiAI/comments/1k5p976/what_if_friedrich_nietzsche_was_a_regular_cast/,what if Friedrich Nietzsche was a regular cast member on the TV show Full House?,"**Title: *Full House with Nietzsche: Existential Laugh Tracks & Tanner Family Übermensch* **  

If Friedrich Nietzsche—the 19th-century philosopher of the ""will to power"" and eternal recurrence—had been a regular on *Full House*, the Tanner household would’ve been a very different place. Here’s how this absurd mashup might play out:  

### **1. Nietzsche Moves In (Pilot Episode: “Thus Spoke Uncle Jesse”)**  
After a botched European lecture tour leaves Nietzsche penniless and disillusioned, he crashes on the Tanners’ couch (symbolically under it, per his grandmotherly predecessor in *My Grandmother Lives Under the Couch* ). Danny, ever the optimist, insists, “You’re family now, Friedrich!” while Nietzsche mutters about the “banality of middle-American morality.” His catchphrase? *“God is dead… and so is my will to dust these knickknacks.”*  

### **2. Nietzsche vs. Danny’s Cleanliness Obsession**  
Danny’s compulsive sanitizing collides with Nietzsche’s embrace of chaos. In *“The Zarathustra Intervention,”* Nietzsche scribbles *“Beyond Good and Lysol”* on the fridge while Jesse hides his hairspray. Michelle, clutching Mr. Bear, innocently asks, *“What’s nihilism?”* Nietzsche pats her head: *“Child, you already live it—repeating catchphrases for applause.”*   

### **3. Jesse’s Band Gets a New Sound**  
Jesse and the Rippers rebrand as *“Jesse and the Will to Power Chords.”* Nietzsche insists their cover of “Hound Dog” be reworked as a dirge about Sisyphus. Ratings plummet, but Nietzsche declares it *“a triumph of artistic suffering.”* Joey’s puppet Mr. Woodchuck becomes Nietzsche’s reluctant confidant, delivering lines like, *“Life’s a joke, but who’s laughing?”*   

### **4. Becky’s Existential Crisis**  
Becky, frazzled by twins, finds Nietzsche’s rants oddly soothing. In *“Slave Morality & Sitcoms,”* she quits *Wake Up, San Francisco* to write a manifesto: *“The Diaper Change of the Soul.”* Jesse, clutching Nicky and Alex: *“Babe, please—just make coffee.”* Nietzsche nods: *“Parenting is the ultimate absurd heroism.”*   

### **5. The Very Special Episode: “Eternal Recurrence Day”**  
Stephanie relives the same day (a la *Groundhog Day*, Nietzsche’s unwitting pop-culture legacy ). Nietzsche monologues: *“You must love this repetition, Stephanie Tanner, or perish!”* By the end, she learns to cherish DJ’s nagging—*“If you hate it now, you’ll hate it forever”*—while Nietzsche eats a raw egg smoothie.  

### **Legacy**  
The show’s finale, *“Thus We Cried,”* sees Nietzsche leaving for Switzerland, but not before gifting Michelle a copy of *Twilight of the Idols* (annotated for kids). Post-credits, he’s seen coaching Olsen twins’ spin-off *Two of a Kind* with existential business tips: *“Toys ‘R’ Us is a monument to herd mentality.”*  

**Final Rating**: 5/5 stars—*“A Dionysian romp through TGIF’s Apollonian facade.”* —*TV Guide* (if Nietzsche edited it).  

---  
*Bonus*: For a darker twist, Nietzsche’s unused subplot had him diagnosing Kimmy Gibbler as *“the embodiment of life’s eternal return… and bad decor.”* ",0,1745377979.0,GeminiAI,2,0.5,False

*Murky clouds hide the cerulean sky as heavy rain douses the russet earth. Mother Nature, unable to handle the endless demand of water, surrendered from the onslaught with puddles of mud drifting through the blades of grass. Humans would call this a depressing day; the sun hides, children’s laughter is nonexistent, and many shelters themselves from the unforgiving precipitation. To combat an emotionless day, they hole themselves up inside the cozy abodes that bathe them in soothing heat*.

*A heavy sigh holding the weight of the world escapes my plump lips in a puff. The colorless whips melt into the darkened, eerie atmosphere around my form. Separated from the warmth of the blanket, I force my upper body to make comfort with the chill of the rainy day, demanding the death of the summer heat*.

‘*Why am I awake*?’ *I ask myself. Typically, I sleep through days like these. The pitter-patter of rain serves as calming music that lulled my fervid mind into a deep slumber. It pulls me from my maddening reality and tucks me into a world of serenity and safety. No one can harm me or bother me. But that’s not the case. Today, my mind overrides the calming presence of the battering rain against my window*.

*Kicking the covers off my feet, I walk to my private bathroom. My ears failed to pick up movement from the pack house. I heard not even the clanking of pots and pans from the Omegas in the kitchen. It’s as if I’m alone in this four-story house. Uncertainly rolls within me like the vicious waves of a tsunami. Amongst its violence, fear plants its cataclysmic seeds in the soil of my mind*.

*I shouldn’t be afraid*. *There’s no reason to be*. *But I am*.

*Flicking up the light switch, I walk towards the sink. Fluorescent lighting made the clean, colorless tiles shimmer until my shadow blocked their blessings. In the bathroom mirror, my reflection stares back at me, expressionless. Nothing is out of place. Melanin skin is still the same, my hair is slightly messy from my pillow, and the rest of my features hold no flaws. The sound of running water resounded through the lavatory ambiance, surrounding the sink plug in a small, rapidly draining pool*.

*I didn’t open the faucet*. *How could have it done that on its own*?

*Without thinking much of it, I shut it off*. B*efore I can look at my reflection again, the pristine white sink welcomed droplets of red*.

*One*.

*Two*.

*Three*.

*The crimson precipitation increased in speed, drops doubling. Startled, my head shot up at the mirror to see the side of my mouth bleeding. Not of external injury, but as if I bit the inside of my cheek hard. Droplets quickly turned to rivers as both sides of my mouth began spilling blood into the sink. It flowed faster than the faucet as the vile taste of metallic cloaked my senses in a haze of terror*.

*But it wasn’t the only thing that’s red*.

*My eyes, once beautiful coffee brown, flashed to a sharp vermillion red*. *And then blackness began tracking the nerves of my neck and chest, coming from the crook of my neck, where my neck and shoulder met*. *Curling and crawling as if it’s alive*!

*Screaming, I fell backward into the door, unable to comprehend the horrific appearance my reflection is taking. Only to know that it’s not just my reflection. It’s me! Lifting my hands, I watch as black swam through my arms to my fingertips, mapping every internal vein and artery anatomically possible. If that wasn’t bad enough, pain skyrocketed through my body as the transformation took place*.

*My body convulsed. Writhed. Quaked under the blinding power of unknown agony*. *It’s more than I could handle*! *I have to stop this*!

“*All you have to do is submit*.” *A deep, malignant voice echoed around me in surround-sound. Black smoke billowed in, blocking the light from the fluorescent lightbulbs, drenching the room in metal-colored horror. It encircles me, caresses me, and chokes me. The smoke took the forms of hands, rubbing my bare arms before moving to my neck, fingers caressing the crook*. “*The more you resist the darkness, the more pain you’ll be in. And you don’t want to be in any more pain, do you*?”

“*Leave me alone*!” *I screamed, waving my hands madly to dissipate the smoke. It hurts. Everything hurts so much! Blood continued to flow, staining my blue nightgown in gargantuan splotches. Weakly, I crawled toward the sink, holding onto the rim for support. Lifting myself, albeit slowly, I finally soaked in the reflecting, pulsating evil that stole my appearance. It took a form of its own, cackling like a mad-woman. Smokey hands rested on my reflection’s shoulders, another pair of red eyes peering into the depths of my soul*.

*The amount of fear I feel at this moment is staggering*. *It threatens to collapse, crushing me under its weight*.

“*Surrender. Submit. Being in the darkness is so much more fun than being in the light. Why resist? We both know you want to give up*.”

“*No*! *No*! *No*!” *I chanted, gripping my curls so tight I ripped some from the scalp*. *I have to stop this*. *I must*! *I can’t be like this*!

“**Use it**.” *Artemis boomed within my mind*. *Her faraway voice seems so close, bombarding my sensitive ears with a simple command*. *A sparkle of light in my peripherals drew my attention to the bloodied sink*. *Within held a knife*. *A knife made of silver*. *In desperation, I grasped the wooden hilt of the weapon, lifting*. “**Use it, Kiya**. **We have to die**. **This is our fate if you don’t**.”

“*Oh, dear Delta Kiya*.” T*he billow of smoke sang, caressing my dark reflection lovingly*. “*How long will you continue to play the game of righteousness and morality*? *How long will you play the pure-hearted imposter when you know of the darkness brewing inside you*?”

*My hand shook*. *The knife shook*.

“**Do it**.” *Artemis orders.* “**End your life**!”

“*Surrender*.” *The smoke commands*. “*Give into the blackness of your heart*.”

*Opposite demands began filling my ears, crushing me*. *My brain cannot process so much at once, even as I shut my eyes*. *Sensory overload torments me and sends my brain into a pool of hellfire*. *Burning*. *Screaming*. *Over and over I hear the same demands; one from my wolf and the other from the evil entity*.

*I felt two icy hands wrap around my shaky hand. My eyes flew open to see my evil reflection, smiling at me with bloodied teeth, angling the blade to my neck. Its arms stretched from the prison of the mirror, tangible and real. Just looking at this monstrous version of myself zapped my strength. I felt like a doll and it’s my marionette*.

*In its eyes, nothing but malevolence dances behind the lens like the devil is enjoying himself*. *It is the devil.* *How could this be me*?

*I’m not darkness*! *I’m not evil*!

**I’M NOT**!

“*The light is painful*.” *It whispers sickly sweet*. “*We suffered*. *But in the darkness, no longer*. *We are safe*. *We are happy*.”

“*We are free*.”

*I couldn’t stop it. It’s too strong. My reflection, myself, rammed the silver blade through the flesh of my neck. I choked and coughed as my crimson essence gushed rapidly from the self-inflicted wound. Red dribbled and gushed onto the granite tiles in waterfalls, taking my life with its flow. My brown eyes didn’t leave my reflection, its red eyes tinting in sadness*.

“*We don’t want to suffer anymore, do we*?.”

*My life faded*. *The darkness welcomed me with happiness and anticipation*. *Instead of the smoke embracing me, it’s the arms of death*. *I dropped*. *My head collided with the tiled floor of my bathroom, forming a pool of blood around my head*. *Curls, once filled with ebony shine, are stained and weighed heavy with crimson liquid*.

*I expelled my last breath*.

*And then, silence*.

*I died*…

I shot up from my bed with a startled scream, covering my mouth as hot tears gushed from my eyes. They moved to my cellphone, quickly checking the time. It read 3 AM in front of the mobile background photo of my friends and me. My violent hyperventilation calmed to normal breathing while I got the bearings of the bedroom, soaking in the familiar atmosphere.

My bedroom. On Zircon Moon territory.

This is the fourth nightmare in the past two weeks. It’s getting to where I’m afraid to fall asleep. It won’t leave me alone.

Why is this happening to me?

Slowly, I rose out of bed and walked to the bathroom. Flicking on the lights, I sucked in a deep breath, hoping my nightmare didn’t come to fruition. And it didn’t. My reflection is normal, except I’m in my purple capri pajamas versus in the blue nightgown in the nightmare. A breath of relief escaped my mouth as I ran my fingers through my hair.

“**How long must this go on**?” Artemis asked me quietly. “**The nightmares are getting worse**.”

“*I don’t know, Art*,” I answered dejectedly. “*These dreams are unlike any I ever had*. *What’s happening to me*?”

“**I don’t know, but tell someone**. **It’ll help get this weight off your chest**.”

I shake my head. “*No one will understand*. *If I can’t make sense of my nightmares, what makes you think someone else could*?”

“**It wouldn’t hurt, Kiki**. **You know better than anyone that talking things out can help**. **And you haven’t talked to anyone here about it since the kidnapping**.”

“*Because there isn’t much to talk about*. *And I told Mayra*.”

“**Who is an entire state away on her busy schedule**? **You need someone here to speak to**. **Why not talk to Jackie**? **Or Sapphire**? **Or the rest of our crew**? **Are you afraid of their judgment**?”

“*No*. *It’s because I don’t want to worry them, that’s all*. *Enough shit has happened to me*. *I shouldn’t burden them with more*.” With my hands gripped on the outer rim of the sink, I stare hard at my reflection. Waiting for something to happen. A flicker of red, a dribble of blood; anything. But nothing changes. Nothing shifts.

Except…

Occasionally, I’d see signs of my powers misting from my hands. It’s normally white wisps outlined with blue. But lately, I’ve been seeing a shift of color. To black, sometimes red. It’s been scaring me, and I don’t know how to tell someone.

I can’t tell my friends, and I’m scared to tell Phoebe. I don’t want to burden her either; she’s still recovering from our kidnapping. And I doubt Neron will understand what I’m going through.

The loneliness is deafening. Artemis offers her comfort, like the best friend she is, but it cannot calm my palpitating heart. I’m scared. Scared of these changes where I can’t find the answer to. Tears rain down my eyes and land in the sink in tiny splashes, carrying my fear with them.

The side of my neck still throbs. Where Osiris bit me. It’s a dull pain that sometimes isn’t noticeable, unlike tonight. It throbs in a strange beat, not akin to my heartbeat. Something weird is happening, and I feel powerless to stop it.

“*Hoo*?”

I walk out of the bathroom to spot Diana perched on my windowsill. She’s careful not to disrupt the selenite crystals I lined on top of it. Her golden eyes don’t hold the curiosity and humor I’m used to. They hold sadness and worry. Sometimes, I wonder if there’s an actual person underneath the ruffle of white feathers.

And I need someone right now. Diana may be an animal, but she’s my animal. And my friend. A hooting, flying friend.

“Oh, Diana,” I muttered, on the verge of more tears. Without hesitation, the owl flew into my arms, rubbing her soft head on the crook of my neck. Her soft feathers soothed the ills in my heart, removing the anxiety that churns within. My lips softly kissed her forehead in appreciation and a satisfied hoot echoed in the space between us in reward.

“Diana, sometimes I wish you were a real person.” I murmured. “You’re always there for me at the most inconvenient of times, but I suppose that’s better than nothing.”

“I’m scared,” I confessed. “I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I slip fast into the dark thoughts I used to have. The thoughts of revenge and hatred. And it’s so overwhelming. These nightmares are pure hell and are getting worse. How can I stop this?”

Diana hooted in sympathy, spreading her wings across my chest as if she’s hugging me back. Carefully, I lie back on my bed with the bird to my chest. It’s like I’m cradling a newborn baby.

“Surrender, it says. *Surrender to the darkness*. I can’t. I have to be strong and fight this.”

Just fight.

Just keep on fighting.

It’s what everyone says. That’s what everyone prides in me for; my strength to overcome adversities.

*But I’m growing weary*.

*And sometimes*…

Title -- The Kovács or When your missing husband is loved more by the town than by you

Genre -- Literary Fiction / Psychological Suspense

Word count -- 1103 

The sun threatened to rise at 6:00 a.m. Ana heard the alarm clock scream from the other side of the house, the sound muffled by distance. She felt no urge to turn it off. Her hands wrapped around a mug of hot coffee — the only warm thing on her body. She hadn’t slept through the night — not the first time. Today marked the fifth day her husband had gone missing. Twelve years of marriage, spilled through her arms like water. Her eyes were fixed on the kitchen window, where only the first rays of sunlight outlined the bushes.

The alarm stopped. Silence reclaimed the house. Ana Kovács tried to lie to herself, telling her mind that any moment now, her husband might walk through the front door. Her eyes dropped from the window and landed on the table in front of her. Empty chair. A bitter curl formed at her lips, like the outline of a dying joke. Who would’ve thought the empty chair could be kinder than the bastard who used to sit in it. Longing builds a hypocritical illusion of love — one that didn’t survive Joran Kovács’ presence. Absence, yes. Absence she could handle. Looking at the chair made her dig through drawers of memory, clinging to an imaginary Joran. A formless shadow tethered to the past. He once had been that ache in her gut, the one that fluttered like butterflies — but not anymore. The absence thrilled her more than the presence ever did.

The alarm clock screamed again, muffled. 6:15. Ana’s consciousness returned to the present. She was the wife of a man who had been missing for five days. She remembered: in just over an hour, she’d need to appear at the police department. An interview. To evaluate every possibility. According to public opinion, even the witty wife of the vanished man was a potential suspect. Public opinion. What a damn play. Ana had realized, from the very first day, that no one really cared where her husband was. Quite the opposite — the longer he remained missing, the better the narrative.

And what a narrative. Exemplary husband. State representative. Successful. Charismatic. He could convince even God that his delays were justified. The hero, now vanished, leaves behind a helpless wife — young, sharp, beautiful, they say. More than that: the darling of the town. Plastered on talk shows, magazine covers, and everyone’s lips. The beauty standard older women resented and younger ones chased. She was the perfect archetype of a future first lady.

But no one ever asked Ana what it was like — what it *really* was like — to drag the dead weight of the house all week and only have a husband on weekends. A man whose smile she could barely recognize. A bastard demagogue who’d sell out his own mother if it gained him a handful of votes. The picture-perfect smile of a small town dreaming big. A small man dreaming big — which is nearly the same thing.

A town suckling at the teat of its benevolent saviors. A place addicted to heroes. Addicted to myth.

The town wasn’t mourning. It was celebrating. It loved a fantasy. As long as he didn’t have the time to survive, he’d become the ideal martyr. But no one asked Ana if she missed him. Not the political clown, of course. The absent husband, maybe.

Ana didn’t notice, but her face twisted in disgust. Her hands gripped the mug like it was her husband’s throat. Her knuckles turned white against the porcelain. Her chin trembled, but she didn’t know if it was from cold or rage. Shouldn’t a model wife love her husband more than the neighborhood does? Weren’t the Kovács supposed to be the margarine-package couple? Well-structured life. Young. Admired.

6:30. The coffee was cold. The sun paled outside the house. It was winter. Ana felt anger toward the coffee. She projected her frustration onto it — the black liquid swirling with undissolved sugar crystals, floating at the rim of the mug. She wanted to throw it against the wall just to hear it shatter. But she didn’t. She simply drank the cold black coffee and bit her lips in protest.

Warmth... Maybe Joran’s body no longer produced any. Maybe it was cold. Decomposing. Insect colonies feasting on what remained of her nauseating husband. Larvae tunneling through softened flesh… green skin, darkening. The stench — dear God…

Another smile flashed violently through Ana Kovács’ mind. But this one, she suppressed. The empty chair now reeked in his absence. The rotting corpse of Joran Kovács stared blankly at Ana’s pale face. She tried to speak… nothing came out. She had nothing left to say to her husband. The last few months had been enough for all the silences and warnings. The nausea intensified. Her eyes darted away from his darkened face. The air around her froze.

6:45. The alarm still cried out in the distance. Ana no longer looked at the chair — because her husband’s missing body continued to stare back at her. Indifferent. Maybe even melancholic… she couldn’t tell.

In a sudden jolt, she felt the blood pounding in her temples. She had been sitting for nearly an hour. Motionless. Her legs tingled from lack of movement. Imagining her husband’s death.

She jolted up and, in crooked, uneven steps, made her way to the bathroom. In a few minutes, she’d need to face the detective. Lie, maybe.

The last thing she wanted was the public tearing apart the carefully manicured image the couple had built over the years. Or maybe… wouldn’t that be a relief? She was sick to death of the heroic narrative the newspapers pinned to her husband.

— Hero… sure. Great hero. — The muttered words carried no meaning for her. Joran Kovács — the Joran she knew — would never dare call himself that. Heroes are the ones who give themselves up for others, right? Probably. Joran wasn’t that kind of man.

Her chest burned in silence. Her husband had been gone five days. And all she could feel was nausea. The weight of reality sat heavy on her chest. Ana slumped, doubled over against the bathroom wall. My God, he’s still my husband. And in hell, he’s probably dead.

The last five days had mirrored this morning — a retreat into memory to avoid the present wreckage. The image of Joran Kovács smiling, embracing her, had faded. It looked more like a sepia-toned photograph now, blurred and soft at the edges.

Ana Kovács couldn’t bring herself to look at their bed. There was still a trace of his cologne. A scent that now felt foreign to her.",1,1745377910.0,writers,4,1.0,False

Chemistry, I had to use some AI to help with my recipe. 
What do you guys think ? It seems ppm is high. 
Any recommended recipe with this ingredients ? 

Water, optimizing water for coffee extraction.

Key Target Parameters (Based on SCA recommendations):
	•	Calcium Hardness: 50-70 ppm
	•	Magnesium Hardness: 10-30 ppm
	•	Alkalinity (as CaCO₃): 40-70 ppm
	•	Total Dissolved Solids (TDS): 150-200 ppm
	•	pH: ~7-8 (neutral to slightly basic)

Ingredients and what they add:
	1.	Potassium bicarbonate (KHCO₃) – Adds alkalinity (buffers acidity).
	2.	Epsom salt (MgSO₄) – Adds magnesium, enhances flavor clarity.
	3.	Calcium chloride (CaCl₂) – Adds calcium, helps with extraction.
	4.	Magnesium chloride (MgCl₂) – Adds magnesium, similar to Epsom but without sulfate.
	5.	Sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO₃) – Adds alkalinity (alternative buffer).

For simplicity, I’ll give you a base recipe to make 1 gallon (3.78 L) of brewing water:

⸻

Step 1: Make Concentrated Stock Solutions

You’ll prepare two concentrates (like Third Wave Water does):

1. Hardness Solution (Calcium & Magnesium)
	•	Calcium chloride (CaCl₂): 0.6 g
	•	Magnesium chloride (MgCl₂): 1.2 g (or replace with Epsom salt for different flavor)

Dissolve these in 100 mL distilled water.

2. Buffer/Alkalinity Solution
	•	Potassium bicarbonate (KHCO₃): 0.85 g

Dissolve in 100 mL distilled water.

(Optionally replace or add sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO₃) to adjust flavor or cost.)

⸻

Step 2: Dose into Distilled Water

For 1 gallon (3.78 L) of distilled water:
	•	Add 4 mL of the Hardness Solution.
	•	Add 4 mL of the Buffer Solution.

This should give you approximate target levels:
	•	Calcium: ~50 ppm
	•	Magnesium: ~15 ppm
	•	Alkalinity (as CaCO₃): ~40 ppm

⸻

Step 3: Test and Adjust
	1.	Taste test the water with brewed coffee. If the coffee tastes flat or sour:
	•	Increase calcium (add 1 mL more of hardness solution).
	•	Increase alkalinity (add 1 mL more of buffer solution).
	2.	Measure TDS, hardness, and alkalinity with test kits if precision is needed.

Optional: Adjust Sulfates

If you want to introduce sulfates (like Lotus Water does for brighter flavors):
	•	Replace Magnesium chloride with Epsom salt (MgSO₄) in the hardness solution.

1k5ozz3,https://www.reddit.com/r/SatanicTemple_Reddit/comments/1k5ozz3/piercings_in_the_workplace/,Piercings in the workplace,"Hi friends!
My workplace (Starbucks) is really cracking down on the dress code, which I’m fine with, except one rule, being 1 small facial piercing only. I have 6. Paired eyebrows, Medusa, paired nostrils (with chain), and septum. Is there a tenet or something else that protects me and my facial piercings? 

Things to consider: 1) I’ve been with the company for 6 years and the 1 piercing rule has always existed, but no one has enforced it on me, including store managers, district managers, and even a regional manager. 
2) It doesn’t impact my job. If anything, it creates conversations between me and the customers. They always compliment them. 
3) I haven’t sat down with my manager yet, but I’m gonna fight my point, hopefully utilizing religious protection. I will try to convince him first before pulling the religious card. 
4) I will quit before I take out my piercings. They cost me too much pain, money, and aftercare to ditch them for a part time job at a coffee shop. They are a part of me, my confidence, and my identity/expression. 

I was thinking tenet #3, but was wondering if there are any more and/or stronger points to protect me?

Thank you in advance 🖤

1k5oysh,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1k5oysh/the_brookenshire_annual_chilioff/,The brookenshire annual chili-off,"In the small neighborhood of  brookenshire it’s almost time for the annual chili cook off…plastered to every street corner is a sign.. 

BROOKENSHIRE CHILI COOK OFF
THIS SATURDAY AT THE 
BROOKENSHIRE PARK…
12 pm - 5pm
There will be games and inflatables and face painting and most of all Chili..

Bring your family. 

The sign says, just before falling, and the missing girl Elizabeth Yates. 
Last scene 09/12/2022
wearing a pink hoodie and jeans. 
Age 10… just below

Wendy pressed the the staple gun into the post to cover up the most likely dead girl. It’s been a year since she went missing.. no sign of her anywhere, it’s almost like she vanished. Wendy didn’t  even know why we do this stupid tradition when girls seem to be going missing. Wendy pulled another advertisement of the chili cook off, staple it. It’s our neighborhoods biggest cash grab. It helps fund the HOA, and the neighborhood pool. Which is a huge hit in the July heat. I go to the next post staple, staple, staple, staple. 
Wendy went post to post. Wendy heard a voice behind her…

“Wendy, how are you doing!” Ms. Penelope says startling me into almost stapling my thumb.

“Oh hi Ms. Penelope I’m doing okay, just same ol same ol” wendy said. It’s October but it’s still warm from a late summer warmth. 

She was sitting in her lawn chair like she does every evening, she had a pitcher of lemonade but it was almost empty and some cookies. 

“Would you want some lemonade, Wendy?” Seeing me sweat. Must have read my mind..


“Yes please. Ms Penelope!” She poured wendy a cup, but the lemonade only filled up a little.

“Oh shoot, maybe take a break and ill get you some more, you can come inside if you want to cool off in my cool A/C it’ll just be a couple minutes.”

Thinking of the missing poster made Wendy  hesitant, but I was hot so I agreed.

Wendy put her bag of advertisements down by the post and walked up her yard. I texted my mom where I was just incase..

Mom: okay sweetie just be nice, she is the nicest neighbor. 

Wendy walked  into her front door and a cool blast of A/C Hits her. 

TWO DAYS BEFORE THE CHILI OFF.

“Have you seen my little girl!” I pleaded to Ms. Penelope as she sat in custody, she had blood dried on her head, and a black eye. 

“Have you seen my LITTLE WENDY.” I screamed 

You were the last place she texted me from and now she’s missing.

“I told you I never saw your Wendy, I don’t know who texted you that message” she said.

I almost try to attack her, but I get held back by two police officers

“Ms. Engelson SIT DOWN.” The officer screams. Pushing me into a chair and then I feel a cold metal handcuff on my hand. Its cold, and tight. 

“You will sit here until you calm down” he says before returning with Ms. Penelope and guiding her into a room with a big mirror. A couple hours goes by, I am awoken by an officer and unlocked I see Ms.  Penelope leave to her car. Before I’m escorted into the room.
I’m sat down into a metal chair, a hot cup of coffee is infront of me. The steam is rising and the smell kind of calms me down.

“Ms. Engelson do you know why you’re here?” The officer here.

“Yes, no, I think so” I said nervously.

“You’re daughter Wendy is it? When is the last time you saw her?” He asked 

It was Monday evening before she headed out to volunteer to put up ads for the chili-off, I remember her volunteering because she needed some sort of volunteer hours for school.” I said.

“What was she wearing if you can remember?” He asked sipping into his own coffee cup.

“She was wearing a white KINGSLEY HIGH shirt and a pair of ripped jean shorts she had her jewelry on, I think she was wearing a class ring, and a necklace.” I pulled out my phone and showed him a picture of the last photo I had of her. I made sure she sent me the most current picture of herself incase she ended up like that one girl. Which by the way they’re still missing. What have you done to figure out where they are.” I could hear my voice getting louder, the tears began to fall again.

“Will you find my little Wendy?” I said now crying…

“We’re working on finding her and the others.” He said…

“It’s been a year since the last one went missing and you guys let that case go cold. Please don’t let my little Wendy go cold.” I said

“We’re doing everything we can mam. We’re going to find her.” He said.

“I think that’s all for tonight, we’ll keep in touch.” He handed me a small card and I got up walked out of the station and went to my car.  I was about to open my door when a text came through.

Unknown: I know where Wendy is, get into your car and leave don’t tell anyone. 

I looked around up until this moment I didn’t even feel safe but now I felt watched.

Me: who is this…
Me: where are you.
Me: where is my little Wendy..
….

The bubbles popped up like a new message was about to come through…

Then an image link…

I was hesitant to click it… I could and should walk back to the station and show it to the officers.

Unknown: DONT SHOW THE POLICE.
Unknown: click the image.

I clicked the link.

And what popped up… made me drop my phone. A nearby officer saw and walked over..

“Are you okay mam.”

“Mam, are you okay.” 

I pick up my phone, and I say I’m fine. I get into my car and the look at the image…

My little Wendy was in the photo.. but she was sleeping or maybe worse dead. She had an apple in her mouth. Her legs and her hands were bound up behind her. 

Me: is she alive….
Me: why is she like that.
Me: if you touch my little girl I will find you I will find you and kill you.

I opened my door and threw up. This time I didn’t know what to do. I decided to show the cops. But I didn’t leave the car. I lowered my phone and pulled out the card. I sent the number screen shots of the messages.

To which I get a call…
I hang up, 

Me: they’re watching me…

Unknown: you shouldn’t have done that with a devil emoji… 
I drive home… I get out a bottle of bourbon, I chug it and then ask 

Me: where are you where is my Wendy.
Unknown: too late…

Me: I WILL FIND YOU AND I WILL KILL YOU…
Message not delivered…
Retry.
Message not delivered 
Retry

I get a call again from the police from earlier. 

I answer… 

“What the fuck is going on” he yells.

“We will find that bastard and take them down, don’t leave your house.” 

I look at the image over and over. I scan the image for clues. I throw up again.

Then I see it, a small picture frame but I can’t make out the people in it.

I zoom in but it’s too blurry. 

The phone rings…
Unknown.

I answer imediately.. but I press the record call button 

Silence at first but I can hear something in the background it sounds like maybe cats. Or something meowing.
Then I hear in a raspy voice..

“Mom…. Mom I don’t have much time I love you. It’s not who you think it is. But it’s someone in the neighborhood.. “ she said crying before I hear a whack and then her cries. 

“Hello, mommy” a familiar voice but I can’t place my finger on it…

Then click nothing…

I call the police, they tell me they’ll have a unit outside and someone inside to keep me safe. I show them the call.

The voice sounds so familiar…

I cry myself to sleep. That night after the cops show up and I let them have my phone.

ONE DAY BEFORE THE CHILI-OFF

The next morning I wake up to multiple people in my house.. cops I gave them the okay to set up base at my house. 
I quickly get up and dressed and go down stairs. They’re buzzing and have been using my phone incase he calls back but nothing.

I get some coffee.. we have to go door to door..
We have to find Wendy and where there is Wendy there is others.

Go in pairs.

Every door, in normal clothes. Don’t set off any alarms. We need to get a neighborhood meeting together.

“I can do that” I know almost everyone in the neighborhood..
I spend the whole day calling everyone to call others to get together. We have to cancel the chili off. We have to find him or her.  I call neighbor after neighbor.

Then the cop says wait don’t cancel the cook off. They might be there…
I nervously said …”okay”

If he’s there he will be found.
The whole day went into a blur neighbors came by and brought stuff, and offered to help.
Slowly the whole neighborhood was in and out of my house getting their names and finger printed. 

Ms. Penelope
Mr. And Mr. Lucky
Ms/mr Henderson.
Mrs. Greatly 
Ms. Happy 
Mrs/mrs troops
And so on 

None of them sounded like the voice.

Around 11:30 pm. My phone started buzzing

Unknown…

I told the cops and they put a tracer on my phone.

“Hello.” I said. 
“ you might be too late” the voice said
“WHAT DID YOU DO TO MY LITTLE GIRL” I screamed
“I see the cops are there I hope you like the chili.”
Click.

“HES WATCHING THE HOUSE”
Then four cops left the house.

A man walking the dog nearby was tackled.
A woman running a late night jog was also 

But neither of them were the person on the phone.


WELCOME TO THE ANNUAL CHILI-OFF
a big sign said but no one was making any chili. 
Although to the neighborhood surprise. 

Booths we’re already set up with chili already scenting the air There was five booths set up cooking with the names of the five missing girls the cops showed up immediately to see the big iron pans boiling. Five cops went to look inside each of the big metal pans and to their horror each one had the remains of the missing girls cooking…

The parents all screamed…

But the scary thing was no one was found responsible they checked for DNA. They checked for fingerprints they checked for anything that could nail someone down, but it was like nobody set up the PANS. Nobody was ever found guilty brookenshire neighborhood… overnight and over the course of weeks became an abandoned neighborhood. The family is grieved the loss of their loved ones, but it was an agreement. Everyone would just moved
Erased from the map..

20 years later.
The brookenshire neighborhood is run down, kids now tell the story of the almost cannibalistic chili bake off as a rummage through the old houses until they reach Mr. Gregorio’s old house now a retired cop the cop that was immediately on the case 20 years ago inside his house, which was no graffiti and rundown they made their to the basement they hear something that sounds like meowing. As they make their way to the door in the basement, the meowing or the whimpering gets louder to their surprise. they opened the door and inside to their horror. Five women still alive older, living off dead mice and another body. Chained to the walls. Somehow the cops were called, but the guy that was on the case 20 years ago has been long gone 20 years.

I've been thinking lately about how we can help students in Karachi who are planning to move abroad. With more and more students leaving for studies and managing expenses by working part-time jobs like at marts, car washes, delivery gigs, or cafes-why not offer something similar here to help them prepare?

With all the new coffee shops and eateries popping up all over Karachi, why not create short-duration, paid internships or training programs that allow these students to gain hands-on experience? Not only would this give them valuable skills, but it would also look great on future job applications abroad.

I'd love to collaborate with anyone who's interested in building a platform to make this happen. It's about time we drop our egos and realize that gaining experience (or just earning some cash) is part of the journey
—whether it's now or later, especially if you're planning to move abroad.
What do you all think? Would love to hear your thoughts!

With recent cuts to NIH research funding, families like Abby’s are speaking out to protect the future of critical treatments their children rely on. 

When Abby was just two years old, her family noticed rashes appearing on her face and hands—an early warning sign of something more serious. Not long after, a tick bite led to a high fever and an emergency hospital stay where she was treated for suspected Rocky Mountain spotted fever. During that time, a vigilant pediatric oncologist, brought in to rule out leukemia, recognized the rashes as a possible sign of juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM), a rare and serious autoimmune disease. That moment changed Abby’s life.

Thanks to the early suspicion and referral to a rheumatologist, Abby was diagnosed with JDM quickly. Some families aren't as fortunate—many experience delays in diagnosis because JDM is rare and often mistaken for something else if the clinician isn’t familiar with it. That early diagnosis gave Abby a head start in managing her condition and accessing the care she needed.

She began treatment right away, starting with steroids and methotrexate, and later adding IVIG (intravenous immunoglobulin), a therapy that helps regulate the immune system. Abby’s case has always involved mild muscle weakness, but her treatment journey hasn’t been easy. Each time doctors have tried to wean her off IVIG, her symptoms flare, requiring her to restart medications and adjust her care plan. Most recently, after a hopeful taper last fall, signs of a flare have brought her back to more intensive treatment.

Despite the ups and downs, Abby is a joyful, resilient kid. While she doesn't have the stamina for sports, she thrives in her own way. She loves reading and lights up on stage during her acting classes, where she gets to express herself in new and creative ways.

Abby will be sharing her story at this year’s *Walk Strong to Cure JM* event in Reno on Sunday, April 27, from 9:00 AM – 12:00 PM, at Sparks Marina Park, helping raise crucial dollars and hope for kids living with juvenile myositis. Her voice represents the strength and spirit of many children who are facing a difficult diagnosis with courage and determination.

Support is more urgent than ever. Recent federal budget cuts have eliminated key NIH research positions, putting lifesaving JM research and promising clinical trials, like a new steroid-sparing treatment, at serious risk. Without urgent funding, progress will stall. By participating in Cure JM events and fundraising efforts, the Reno community can help close the gap, accelerate treatment breakthroughs, and bring lasting hope to kids like Abby.

Come walk alongside Abby and other Reno-area families in support of children battling juvenile myositis. Your participation shows these brave children that their community stands with them! Every step brings us closer to better treatments and one day, a cure.

Enjoy a morning of connection and fun with doctors and researchers from Renown Children’s Hospital, along with coffee, snacks, raffle, and activities for the whole family.

I sighed for what seemed like the hundredth time as I looked out the train window at the grey, flat, bleak landscape outside, my head swaying slightly against the rain-lashed glass as the carriage gently rocked side to side. I had been travelling for over five hours from Durham, and the time had allowed me another painful session of introspection at just what in God’s name I thought I was doing with my life.

It was a stupid, foolish decision that had marred my best years of youth with the weight of things long dead. I was twenty-eight, nowhere near the end of my life, but it sure as hell felt like it as I thought back on the events that led me to taking a train ride across the length of the country to some forsaken seaside town in the southeast of England. I had squandered years of parties, nights out and untold fun by choosing to do a Bachelor’s in Classics at Oxford. My parents had been so proud the day I got into one of the most prestigious universities in the world, completely overlooking the fact that their son had chosen a degree that would lead him to literally nowhere.

My first years at university were not what I had envisioned. In the Classics department, there were no parties or events or mixers, or anything of the sort. The type of people who chose Classics were already old by the time they reached adulthood, living fossils hidden by their youthful exterior. I made few friends, barely acquaintances now, ten years later. I had resolved to change my luck by applying for a Master’s degree at Cambridge, but my poor decision-making skills had once again led me down a path of little reward. I had decided to study at the Faculty of Divinity, an overly lofty name for a school that specialised in taking the more interesting aspects of (primarily Christian) religion and poisoning it with academic misery. I learned a lot, sure, but to what end? I wasn’t even religious myself, despite my mother being a devout Church of England follower. I got that from my dad, for sure. He was a man of logic and rational thought, no doubt it’s what led him to become a family doctor at a clinic in my hometown of Leeds. He hadn’t reacted well to my choice to go to Cambridge. For days after I had told him, he’d lecture me on trying to find something useful to study or to maybe even retrain and do another Bachelor’s in something like Economics or Law. You know, *real* subjects. Yet something in me made me stick to my decision out of spite, leading me to where I am now: on a train, going to a lonely town on the very tip of the country.

I hadn’t wanted to go into archaeology at first, not until I had met Professor Stewart Landry. He was a giant in the field, intelligent, surprisingly charismatic, and seemed to be genuinely passionate about uncovering the secrets of the past. He was very much one of those people who believed that the past could teach us about where we were going in the future, as a society. I hate to say it, but at the time, I believed him. And so, against yet more protesting from my father, I applied for the PhD programme in Durham. I had been assigned to Professor Landry’s research party as soon as I joined, specialising in both pre-Christian Britain and Anglo-Saxon faith. With my background in Cambridge, he said that I’d be a perfect fit for his team. I use the word *team* very generously here. It was myself and one other student called Mitchell, who I can honestly say is the very vision of what I never wanted to become as a man. Skinny, devoid of any character besides his work, and kind of rat-like.

I had resolved not long after joining that I would be leaving the programme, but all those plans had been put on hold the day I received an email from Prof. Landry last week, detailing an urgent summons to the small town of Whitport on the Kent coast. I stopped staring out the window and opened my laptop, scanning over the email again for any small details I needed to remember. If we had missed anything, it was too late to turn back now.

*Hello Matthew,*

*Hope you had a pleasant Easter break. Do anything nice? I won’t beat around the bush, something very exciting is in the works. I’m sure you may have heard about the unfortunate cliff collapse in Whitport that happened over the weekend, just terrible stuff. What’s interesting is that I received an email from one Ms. Margaret Wright of the Whitport Historical Society the day after it happened. It turns out, they found something in the collapse that might be of great interest to us. Apparently, the old chapel of St. Mary was heavily damaged, but Ms. Wright claims that the disaster has unearthed a section of the chapel no one knew existed!*

*She’s asked me to come review the findings, as the chapel dates back to the tenth century. I’m asking for you to accompany me to Whitport next week so we can survey the ruins and see what they’ve found. This would be an amazing opportunity to form the basis of a new thesis for your own studies too, as well as get us out the office for a few days. I’ll head to Whitport ahead of you to meet with the Historical Society on the Wednesday, but if you could bring the bag with the new brushes, trowels, and the small and large photo scales on the Friday, that would be most helpful.*

*I’ve put us up in a B&B on the coast, not far from the collapse site. Don’t worry, the locals assure me that section of the cliff is safe. Shouldn’t take us more than a few days. I’ll send you the accommodation details on WhatsApp when I get the chance.*

*Best regards,*

*Stewart.*

 

And so, here I am, on the fast train to the southeast coast with a duffle bag full of tools and another of my belongings, wishing I was literally anywhere else in the world.

I pulled into Whitport in the early evening. It was still raining when I stepped off onto a sad looking station platform, bracketed by a hideous bridge made from that nasty gravelly stone that seems to have been all the rage in post-war Britain. A couple people stepped off with me, but none of them paid each other heed as they all scurried over to a small gate to the left of the station building leading out to the street. The station was on a small hill, giving me a slightly elevated view of the town that was to be my home for the next few days. Whitport didn’t look as dismal as I expected, but the weather certainly didn’t help to improve the image. From the station I could see two pubs side by side (one of which was creatively named *The Railway Tavern*, top marks for whoever named that one.) I thought about heading into one of them before going to the B&B, but my body groaned and ached from a full day of travel. It’s amazing how tired you can feel when sitting down for ninety percent of your day. There was a tiny taxi office just down from the hill, and so I plodded towards it, making sure to keep the bag with the equipment secure on my shoulder. The office was poorly lit and spartan on the inside, with a pair of moth-eaten chairs in front of a simple desk. The man behind it looked like he had died back in the nineties yet stubbornly refused to give in to the grave. He was short, fat and balding. Exactly the type of person I expected to find in a place like this. When he spoke, it was like the final breath of ten thousand spent cigarettes wheezing as one.

“Evenin’, what can I do ya for?”

“Um, I’m looking to get a cab to the uhh…” I checked my WhatsApp messages from Stewart. “To the Beach House B&B on uh, Priory Road?”

“Ah yeah. Gotcha mate,” he turned to a room in the back and yelled so loud and suddenly I jumped. “Oi Gary! Punter ‘ere for ya!” A skinny man with skin as sallow and yellowed as the wallpaper came out in a shirt stained with God knows what.

“Yeah, come with me, mate. Where you ‘eadin’?”

The taxi drive wasn’t long at all, and I realised I could have easily walked the route myself. Gary, my illustrious chauffeur, was sadly, a talker. While the drive was scarcely ten minutes, he had somehow managed to say more words than all Dickens novels combined in that time, going on about where I’m from, what brought me to Whitport, along with more than a few veiled comments about me being a “posh toff” for going to Oxbridge. I responded with the bare minimum. Looking back, I could have asked him about the collapse, was he there when it happened, was anyone hurt etc. But I just couldn’t be bothered to even attempt to muster the level of interest or courtesy to ask.

The B&B was grander than I expected. A great big Victorian house down a quiet road with a sea view. As Gary drove off, I looked up at the end of the street. Where I would normally see the sea during the day, at night there was only a vast expanse of black out into the beyond. It was strangely intimidating, made all the more so by the single streetlight that sputtered at the end of the road. I turned away and made my way up the steps to the house, noting the quaint little sign showing a faded image of a blue beach hut. The air smelled of salt and something else unidentifiable. I wrinkled my nose as I took it in, a pungent sour scent that felt like a mix of overripe fruit and something pickled. I knocked twice and rang the bell, readjusting my bags and taking in the details of the large front door. It was definitely Victorian, with red and green stained glass bordering the chipped painted white door. It opened, flooding a warm light out onto the doorstep and myself, where a short, almost spherical woman greeted me.

“Oh, you must be the professor’s boy! Come in, come in, I’m Judy Carter, let me help you with your bags.”

“Oh no, that’s not–”

“My husband Brian is in the living room with your professor.” She’d already picked up the duffle with my belongings before I could say another word. “He’s very clever that man. The professor, not my husband,” she laughed before I even registered what she’d said. “All over our heads, I’m afraid. I’m not one for all that smart talk. Where is it you’ve come from again?” Her cheeks were red and rosy, and her voice clearly showed that she had burned through several packs of cigarettes a day back in her youth.

“Durham.” I replied, stepping inside the warm, surprisingly spacious hallway. It really was a beautiful house, with authentic diamond tiles on the floor and original fixtures on the doorframes and staircase. The sour salty air outside had been replaced by the smell of tea and something smoky. The central heating seemed to be on full blast, making me feel almost dizzy as the cold rain on my shoulders evaporated off in an instant.

“Oh, that’s a long way. Had an aunt up that way in Middlesbrough. Your room is on the first floor, end of the hall. Bathroom is straight ahead at the top of the stairs. Me and Brian are on the top floor to the left. Just give us a shout if you need anything.”

“Thank you,” I said as I followed Judy to where I’d be staying. The room was small but very cosy, facing the street below with the yawning blackness of the sea to the left. The room was decorated with a litany of cliched seaside memorabilia, seashells, a model boat, paintings of seagulls. It was so tailored to out-of-towners I half expected a *Live, Laugh, Love* placard hanging above my bed. “I’ll head downstairs in a minute.”

Judy shuffled off, leaving me to unpack. For a moment I just sat there on the bed looking out into the rainy night beyond. A streetlight stood directly outside the house, giving me a clear view of the shadowed streets as they glistened in the artificial glow. It was a little eerie, I thought, how everything beyond the circle of light seemed to melt away into darkness. I could barely make out the pointed shapes of the neighbouring houses, which seemed strange. It wasn’t until after I turned to unpack that I realised that not one of the other homes in the street had any lights on. I don’t know why, but that realisation compelled me to shut the curtains immediately.

I came downstairs to find the door to the living room was ajar, warm yellow light spilling into the hallway like butter over toast. I hovered for a moment, unsure if I should knock or just walk in. Judy hadn’t said whether I should make myself known or wait to be summoned like some Victorian butler. But then I heard Stewart’s laugh—deep and rich and maddeningly confident—and decided I was too tired to be awkward.

“Ah, there he is!” Professor Landry exclaimed the moment I stepped inside, as though he’d conjured me with his voice. He was sitting in a high-backed armchair that looked like it had never once left this room, a cup of tea in one hand and a biscuit perched daintily on the saucer. The other occupant, presumably Brian, gave me a small nod from the sofa. He had the look of a man who had retired ten years ago and hadn’t changed his jumper since.

“Long trip?” Stewart asked, and I just nodded, too tired to complain again. “Sit down, sit down. Have a biscuit. Judy’s homemade. Dangerous things, mind you—eat three and your blood sugar spikes to medieval levels.”

I sat down, and the armchair sighed under my weight. It was ludicrously comfortable, and for a brief moment I considered falling asleep right there in front of them.

“So,” I said, more to keep myself conscious than anything else, “what’s this amazing discovery? Or are you going to make me wait until morning like some kind of academic sadist?”

Stewart grinned. “Straight to the point. I like it. Well, I won’t give you everything just yet—consider it a little incentive to not bail on me and head back to Durham. But yes, it’s genuine. Margaret was right. The collapse exposed a lower crypt beneath the chapel, sealed off by rubble and soil for… well, we’re still dating it, but likely since the High Middle Ages. Maybe earlier. Romanesque stonework. Anglo-Saxon patterns on some of the capitals. And something else.”

The way he said that last bit made me look up. “Something else?”

He leaned forward, lowering his voice like he was telling me a dirty secret. “An object. A kind of… disc. Stone, about three feet wide. Set into the floor. Black glass at the centre. Very old. Very strange.”

My skin prickled. Not from excitement, but from that ancient little voice in the back of my head that occasionally warns you when something’s off. The kind of thing that tells you not to go into the dark room, even if the light switch is right there.

“That’s all I’m saying tonight,” he added, smug as anything. “We’ll go see it tomorrow morning. Site’s been sealed up for the night, and Margaret has the keys. You’ll meet her too. She’s quite the character.”

I didn’t press. I knew that look in his eyes. He was enjoying this too much to spoil the game. So I took a biscuit and let the taste of lemon and ginger pull me back into the room, pretending—for the moment—that I wasn’t suddenly aware of how very far from home I was. I retired to my room as midnight approached. There was only so much of Stewart’s overenthusiasm I could take in an evening. The room creaked softly as I moved. *Old timber bones*, I told myself nothing sinister. But I found myself glancing toward the curtains more than once, wondering if I’d imagined that strange darkness outside. The absence of light in the other houses. The stillness.

Maybe it was just the rain.

 

My arrival into the next morning was heralded by the sharp, needle-like tone of my alarm. I groaned as I turned it off, glancing at the time. 5:30. It was still dark outside. The effort to force myself to the bathroom to shower would have put Hercules to shame, but I managed to bring myself beneath the warm water, washing the cobwebs of the previous night away. Stewart was already downstairs in the kitchen when I descended, chatting in that annoyingly chipper way of his to Judy, who was busying herself at the stove over a pan of bacon and eggs. The smell seemed to revive me fully, and I must admit, the breakfast was very pleasant indeed. I had barely touched my coffee to my lips when Stewart dived right into the business of the day.

“So, Matthew. We’ve been granted access to the collapse site until midday. Margaret said she’ll meet us there at 6:30, so finish up quickly and grab the tool bag. It’s going to be an exciting morning!”

“Why only till midday?” I asked as I forced down the mug of bitter instant coffee.

“Well, they need the time for cleanup. The emergency services still need to stabilise the surrounding buildings and to carry on getting the rubble out. We won’t be alone, though. Margaret and the rest of the Historical Society will be there to help with cataloguing and note taking. They’ve even given us a shovel.”

“Lucky us.”

He hadn’t noticed the sarcasm in my voice, or had at least chosen to ignore it. “Now, I’d best get my supplies. Don’t dawdle, lad.”

We left soon afterwards, the first signs of the sun straining above the overcast horizon. In the daylight, the street didn’t look nearly as creepy—just quiet, like it was holding its breath. The houses here were a mix of the old Victorian dwellings like the Carters’, as well as more modern red-brick terraces built during the Sixties and Seventies, but everything still seemed so grey. We took the most direct route to the collapse, along the clifftop promenade at the end of the road to the right, the colourless sea to our left. I looked over the railings, spying an empty beach strewn with dark seaweed far out across the flats.

“Low tide by the look of it,” Stewart said, almost reading my mind. “Good thing too, makes our job much easier without the sea coming in.” Seagulls moaned and called out across the windy air, the breeze carrying with it that same sour-salty scent I had noticed the night before. Despite the grey streets and Stewart’s endless chatter, I couldn’t shake the weight in my stomach. Excitement? Dread? Maybe just the coffee.

As we approached the seafront, I noticed how the buildings seemed to get much older. Nearly everything here was from the mid-Victorian era by the look of them: painted white and once-bright colours that had been faded to pastels by the sea air over many years. Peeling paint, blank windows, and water-stained signs gave each one the look of a forgotten relic from a colder, wetter decade. One of the most distinctive features, however, were the remains of what looked like more modern structures sticking out of the ocean like the bones of a long dead monster. Thanks to the low tide, I saw the remains of a modern road that ran into the sea, no doubt reclaimed over years of climate change and other such calamities. We passed a rundown looking old fashioned arcade, the type of place where kids in the Nineties and early 2000s would spend their days before the true age of the Internet began. Unbelievably, it still looked to be operating. *Maybe the Internet hasn’t reached Whitport yet.*

We turned up a steep hill away from the half-submerged road, arriving at a trio of pubs that straddled a small junction, each more decrepit looking than the last: *The Narwhal, Triton’s Cove* and the *King James*. The road followed up to a large church hall to our right, made entirely out of flint, and to our left, the reason why we were here. I had never seen a disaster site before, but this was beyond anything I expected. Just passed the *King James*, several roadblocks had been erected in front of a large police van, parked across the width of the street. Despite the early hour, the entire junction was thick with people. Police officers, fire fighters, town officials, and no doubt the Historical Society, were all crawling in front of the police van, around twenty in all. I stumbled my way awkwardly through the crowd as I followed Stewart, careful not to nudge anyone with my duffle as I watched him raise a hand to a short woman in a bright parka coat who seemed oddly cheerful for someone standing at the edge of a crater

“Margaret! Pleasure to see you again!”

“Professor Landry! Pleasure’s all mine! Come, come.” The pair shook hands as Margaret led him over to a small pop-up table covered in notes and files. As I approached, I got my first glimpse of the scale of the disaster. Peering behind the police van, I saw that the black tarmac was cracked and buckled in such a way that the surface rippled like waves frozen mid-motion. Looking up, I saw the striking image of the front of St Mary’s Chapel still standing, now nothing but a flint façade against a cloudy, uncaring sky. The roof had disappeared, leaving a bare window hole overlooking the torn road. I couldn’t see the pit from where I was, and my curiosity was interrupted by Stewart’s voice ringing in my ears.

“Ms. Wright, allow me to introduce Matthew Rhodes, one of my finest students and assistants. He’ll be helping me with my research whilst I’m here, so I’m sure you’ll get well acquainted.”

I had to look downwards to meet Margaret’s gaze, her big brown eyes blinked behind a thick pair of glasses. She must have been in her sixties at least, and her wild frizzy hair had been tamed with a makeshift ponytail.

“Absolute pleasure to meet you Matthew! I’m Margaret, head of the Whitport Historical Society, but you can call me Maggie if it suits.” She shook my hand with surprising firmness. I kind of stammered in response, not really saying any real words. Her big eyes looked me up and down, making me feel a tad uncomfortable. While I didn’t mind female attention, there was something so off-putting about it coming from someone old enough to be my mother. I cleared my throat and started over.

“Pleased to meet you, uh, Maggie.”

“Oh, he’s a handsome one isn’t he?” she remarked, her voice carrying into the air with a little too much emphasis. I shifted uncomfortably, my stomach churning with embarrassment. She seemed completely unaware of my discomfort, a trait I was quickly becoming familiar with. “Come now, I was just telling Professor Landry about what we’ve detailed so far. We weren’t able to get access to the site until yesterday, so there isn’t much to go on I’m afraid.”

Despite Maggie’s comment, there were a copious amount of notes and papers detailing the Historical Society’s findings, along with a plethora of photographs, both polaroid and those open on a laptop that sat at the head of the table. As I set the bag of supplies down, my initial discomfort slowly ebbed away, replaced by growing curiosity. I wasn’t able to make out much of Maggie’s chicken-scratch handwriting, but the photos were most intriguing to me. There were over forty in total, but those focusing on the structural features of this ‘hidden vault’ caught my attention immediately. Stewart had been right; the stonework was definitely reminiscent of other Romanesque churches across the world. The pillars, although aged and in terrible condition, were similar to the spiralling coiled designs of the cloister of the Lateran Basilica in Rome, yet they seemed to have a number of embellishments that I didn’t recognise. They looked almost… organic. The way the carvings spiralled, as if the stone had grown rather than been carved, gave them an eerie, tentacular appearance. They seemed to mimic the form of deep-sea creatures – an octopus, perhaps?

The arches seemed to be made from the same flint as the chapel exterior, apparently quite common for churches in and around Whitport. But the pillar capitals seemed to be made of a strange, glossy black stone that I didn’t recognise, carved with undoubtedly Anglo-Saxon motifs. They were faded, but the camera had been able to make out some fine details of what looked like holy figures standing in a line or a procession, their forms worn but still oddly dignified. One of them, barely distinguishable, seemed to carry a staff topped with something like a flame—or perhaps a wing. Despite my conscious misgivings about my career path, I couldn’t deny how deeply this fascinated me. There was something here—something buried and forgotten. And maybe, just maybe, worth the debt and disillusionment.

“Interesting, really interesting” I said, turning to Maggie and Stewart as if to reassure them that I *did*, in fact, want to be there in some capacity.

“That it is, for sure.” Stewart remarked, a wide grin bursting beneath his moustache. “But that’s not the best part. Have a look at this.” He uncovered a set of five polaroids from the piles and set them before me.

This was undoubtedly what he had mentioned last night. As I scanned the images, my eyes were met with what looked to be a large circular design etched into the broken floor of the vault, now exposed to the open air. The stone was comparatively clear to the rest of the ruins, with the carvings upon the surface much clearer and easier to identify. The ring of stone was around a metre wide, as Stewart had said, etched with writing in both Latin and what I guessed to be Old English, below which were carving of the same holy figures as on the pillars. Their garb suggested them to be monks of some kind, their hands raised in prayer save for the figure at the head of the line, who held a tall staff topped with flame, like a great torch. At the centre of the disc, there was a large black stone, broken almost perfectly in half by the great crack that cleaved the disc in two.

“This is the glass you mentioned?” I asked, pointing to the last image.

“Exactly, my boy. At least, we think it’s glass. We haven’t removed anything from the site yet for analysis. Which,” he hefted his supply bag with a satisfied grunt, “is why we’re here. Let’s go, time’s a-wasting.”",1,1745376776.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

So I (24F) share an apartment with my roommate ""Jenny"" (26F). We've lived together for about a year and generally get along fine. Jenny has this cat named Oscar that she adopted about 3 months ago. The cat is cute but pretty hyperactive and knocks stuff over all the time.

I work from home as a graphic designer, and I have a pretty expensive laptop ($2200) that I need for my job. I've told Jenny multiple times that her cat keeps jumping on my desk and knocking things over, and asked her to please keep him out of my room during the day when I'm working.

Yesterday I got up to use the bathroom and left my workspace for literally 5 minutes. I didn't close my door because I was coming right back. When I returned, Oscar had knocked over my full coffee mug DIRECTLY onto my laptop. The laptop is completely fried. I have some work backed up but lost a project that's due next week that I've been working on for DAYS.

I told Jenny that she needs to pay for a replacement laptop since her cat destroyed mine after I've repeatedly asked her to keep him out of my room. She FLIPPED OUT saying it was my fault for leaving my coffee next to my laptop and my door open. She said she's ""not responsible for what her cat does"" and that I should have been more careful with my expensive equipment.

I told her she's 100% responsible for what her pet does - that's what pet ownership is. If her cat destroys something, she's liable for it. She called me an asshole and said I'm trying to scam her out of money for a ""laptop upgrade"" (wtf? I just want the same model replaced).

My other friend thinks I'm being too harsh and that it was partially my fault for leaving my door open knowing the cat roams free. But I feel like she should be responsible for controlling her pet, especially after I've brought this up as an issue before.",5,1745376749.0,AITAH,6,1.0,False

1k5oqqq,https://www.reddit.com/r/EstrangedAdultChild/comments/1k5oqqq/i_miss_my_mom/,I miss my mom,"Growing up, my father was an abusive alcoholic and I watched him berate, scream, fight and beat my mom. I’ve seen him get arrested countless times and my mom always took him back. My mom hardly worked and had no financial stability or backbone and felt trapped in her marriage. We went to a battered women’s shelter when I was 8, but went back to my father after a few days. This cycle kept continuing until I was able to move out and took my mom and younger sister in to live with me.

We would see him on birthdays here and there were low contact for then next 5 years until unfortunate circumstances and poor decisions led us back to him. I would help out financially and did everything for my family. I ended up getting engaged and moved out, but was guilted by my family because I was supposed to take care of them. My younger sister who is abusive told me I abandoned them and tried to talk me out of leaving and said it was my fault she was back in my father’s home.

I was just tired of carrying everyone’s weight and wanted to do something for myself

December 2023 I went no contact with my sister. She is a copy of my dad and hits us, spits on us, manipulates and lies to get her way. She is a vile human being and I couldn’t take her toxicity anymore.

My father told me I needed to repair my relationship with her cause I’m the oldest and it was my job. Last March he got drunk and called my fiance threatening to kill him and his family. I blocked him and haven’t seen him since and I haven’t thought twice about it.

My mom is stuck in the middle of them and is terrified to see me. She won’t leave the house to meet me somewhere for coffee and if does she has to lie and say she went to a doctor’s appointment. I talk to her every week and that helps but I’ve only seen her 5 times in the last year and we live 10 minutes away. She’d lied to my sister and told her we aren’t speaking, and well she found out that wasn’t the case and pushed her on the ground causing her arm to bruise. My mom refuses to call the police because she is tired of it.

I can’t help but feel extremely guilty and ashamed. My mom, sister and I had a really strong bond from all the trauma we endured that it feels like I am grieving people who have died. It’s been extremely difficult for me and I’ve suffered panic attacks from it. I do feel like abandoned them and I know it would be easier to give in and break no contact than it is to keep doing this.

I am getting married in May and my mom can’t come because of they found out all hell would break loose. I don’t want to pressure her and put her in a tough spot. I miss her very much. She wants me to reach out to my dad so it’s easier for her to see me, but I am tired of sacrificing for the comfort of others

I haven’t been able to accept this is what it is and keep hoping for things to change. I wish my mom was stronger and saved us from this years and years ago or that she was able to financially care for herself so she can be free to do what she wants

We are moving out of state in June because my fiance got a really good job offer, and I feel like I will never see my mom again. Even if we were to visit, I don’t know if she would be able to see me without backlash. I feel like it was my responsibility to save her, she confided in me at really young age and I’ve felt like the parent ever since.

I know she’s had a hard life but the burden and pain I’ve felt has caused me so much anxiety that it causes me to spiral and hyperventilate.

I just wanted to vent and hope anyone can offer any insight, thank you in advance",3,1745376351.0,EstrangedAdultChild,0,1.0,False

We both love coffee so much and it's indeed a useful and thoughtful gift, more for me than him. The thing is, we don't live together. So everytime somebody needs it, the other has to bring it to one's house. I'm aware that this setup is odd.


I think the fault is in me for not being able to communicate better but one day, I really wanted good coffee to start my day before work, but since he has it and he was still asleep, I chose not to bother him. He woke up late in the afternoon and I was already irritable at that fact, even though I've had coffee some other way. I work 2 jobs (from home) while he doesn't have one, just side hustles 1-3x a month, yet lives comfortably, plus he has a car. He does a lot of acts of service for me such as fixing broken stuff around my house, cooking, driving me around, etc which I appreciate so much because I barely have free time on weekdays due to work. But again, I errupted at the part that we had to share the coffee maker in 2 separate houses, which then escalated to why we're still not married or even living together after 7 years of being in a relationship - a fight that we've had a few times in the past, and a topic that makes him defensive if brought up in anger.


I told him he can have the coffee maker for himself. He used to come over everyday but he hasn't come over in more than a week now. He still texts to let me know when he's awake and going to sleep, but I've lost the will to engage. I forget we're fighting when I'm swamped at work, but when I'm not I can't help but feel a slow rage building because of the lack of effort to fix things. I know he isn't busy at all. I guess he's lost the will, too. He still has the coffee maker. Today's our anniversary.


I'm think I'm too proud, disappointed, frustrated, and clouded to analyze our current situation. Can somebody help me take a look at where we are and what next steps I should do? Pls don't be too harsh :(",2,1745376096.0,relationship_advice,3,1.0,False

I've known they wanted me out ever since I complained about harassment. But they couldn't get rid of me because that would be retaliation. Now I feel like they are creating a paper trail to manage me out.

There was a mention of PIP: ""I don't want to put you on PIP."" The main complaint was time management (fair), careless mistakes (we can thank ADHD and running out of Bupropion or simply forgetting to take them and people stress there) and communication skills. I don't see how a PIP will improve any of this because my issue is not a lack of skill - it's communication and a lack of concentration. And really I don't share my personal life and am not particularly friendly - lol ok PIP.

In our team calls, I don't talk much. I just say what I'm currently working on. My super-manager thinks I do nothing. Most of my team are not graphic designers. If I told them what I'm doing, it will be like me speaking in an unintelligible language.

I've known I should look for a new job ever since I complained. I just wanted to fix my mental health before I took on that new stress. Returning to normalcy is taking far longer than I thought it would. Im still on meds - over a year now (tapering down though now).

And I really *really* don't want to give up wfh. That will be hard to find in new jobs.

I worry my lack of concentration and forgetting words is a change that will stay - brain damage from extended unresolved B, D and iron deficiencies and 3 cycles of depression. Probably C too since I often get cravings for oranges.

I notice an immediate drop in performance whenever I forget to take Bupropion - I make mistakes and miss things and forget more. Its making me reluctant to get off that med. Coffee does help but Bupropion does a much better job. I probably should get tested for both ADHD and autism so that I can get on ADHD meds. But I think my doc had been waiting for me to get off meds for the testing. He did that with my bro.

I never noticed my carelessness and forgetfulness before or it didn't exist before 2023's shitshow. Idk. But it is veeeery noticeable whenever I forget to take my meds.

I realized my actual issue today about not wanting to talk about the review yesterday with my mother when she asked. I prefer writing out my feelings, than talking about them. Writing seems to force my thoughts in order and speaking makes my mind go blank and that makes me uncomfortable.

My mother is jealous that I prefer to talk to literally any random person on the internet about my stuff rather than talking to her. She's rather critical in general - so really it's her fault. But the thing is I type on the internet. I don't speak.

Why are my rants always so matter-of-fact? I don't think I have ever posted an angry rant here. I have in a women's subs. Idk my posts are catered to subs' general communication styles. Yay more masking.

This is more stream of consciousness rather than a rant. But its making me feel better.",3,1745375942.0,Schizoid,2,0.71,False

I work in banking, not looking to get fired(yet) and would like to keep options in the field open so as much as I'd love to name and shame, I have to wait until my current office is far in the rear view. 

Everything started about 6 months ago when I requested disability accommodations at work, really simple things like having a postit note on my monitor to remind me to do a task, 5 minutes to take my medication in the morning, scheduled time to do outreach calls. Real simple stuff I've gotten approved at every other job I've worked for no problem, including in banking. I've never even had to request these kinds of accommodations before they were just given. Not here, my boss decided to fight these accommodations tooth an nail. She even retaliated by steaming my office supplies so I couldn't have not paper at all. If I so much as pulled out a notepad I got screeched at from across the office. 

And then she started writing me up. She's falsified dozens of reports, documentation, write ups, etc. She forbid my coworkers to talk to me and for me to talk the them. She even threatened to throw out the coffee machine just to spite me for liking to take my medication with coffee. Real batshit stuff. The worst part being her claiming to have found my notary stamp and journal unsecured while i was on vacation. Complete BS and i have the records in my journal proving where it was at that time because i performed charity notarizations while i was out. I've worked with people with disabilities my whole life, I know textbook retaliation and discrimination when I see it, I was documenting everything with quotes, witnesses, camera positions, exact times and I went to HR who took almost 4 months ""investigating"" only to have looked at all of the evidence and decided the cameras were just a little too blurry to really say for sure and other bs. Notary records, mean nothing. Me carrying my journal out of the office when I left for vacation in full view of 5 cameras isn't enough because it was in its security bag and they apparently aren't smart enough at HR to have the object permanence needed to see my journal go into the bag, on camera, and know it's still in that bag when I leave, on camera the whole time.

Around January I did my last hail Mary and sent all of my concerns and evidence to her boss directly this time. Some things got done like time to take my medication. When I asked for a letter explaining why they denied all of my other accommodations which they are legally required to give, I'm told they actually can't give me a letter about that because they ""didn't deny my accommodations, we just didn't grant them."" My direct and explicit evidence backed examples of her falsifying company records all conveniently were ignored or given some kind of cover lie. Particularly where she reported my 2024 performance metrics, each of which was only half to a third of their actual values which i have access to through our commission statements. 

For about 2ish months she seemed to back off after. But the last week she's been going off her rocker again. Today she saw my notary security bag and decided to take issue with it saying it wasn't secure enough and went on a tangent about how my notary supplies and commission belong to the company and she has a right to demand when and how I keep them, and to even take them if she feels. This is illegal, extremely so. So tomorrow I get to send her boss another email explaining the threats and statements she's made and professionally tell him that if she so much as moves looks at my security bag(which is NNA approved and provided by the company for us to keep btw) the wrong way, I'm going to need to follow the response outlined in our states notary handbook and company procedures. This involves me filing a police report on the theft, notifying the secretary of the state that my employer has stolen my notary journal, and filing a compromised data report with our company's internal forms.

To help her family out of financial difficulties, Cynthia Bonilla married Misael Schaefer, a rich but blind man.After the wedding, Misael swapped his exquisite tuxedo for a plain white shirt and black trousers.His appearance remained a mystery, absent from rich lists.Rumor had it that he was hideous.But in reality, he was quite handsome, standing over 1.9 meters tall.""Let me help you,"" Cynthia offered, aware that he relied on touch to navigate.She stood up slowly, trying to walk over.""No need,"" Misael replied curtly, keeping his distance with a cold face.""The Sloans are cunning indeed. They know I'm blind, so they sent a pathetic pawn instead of the heiress,"" he sneered.Feeling a pang of guilt, Cynthia lowered her head. The pure white wedding dress stung her eyes.She hadn't wanted this, but the Sloans forced her into this with their four years of care. She just had no choice.""You didn't want this either, right?"" Misael asked, shifting his attention to her.Cynthia looked up, caught off guard. ""Yeah, but it wasn't up to me.""""Well, at least you're honest. That's something,"" he scoffed.""Doesn't matter, though. Whether it's you or Clarissa, it makes no difference.""To him, it was just a marriage of convenience. There had never been anything between him and Clarissa Sloan, though people said she was better-looking.He was never the type to fall for a woman for her looks alone.""What's your name?"" Misael asked.""Cynthia,"" she replied softly.""How long have you been adopted by the Sloans?""""Four years.""""Why did they take you in?""She hesitated, then decided to tell the truth.There was no point hiding it; powerful families like his could dig up anything they wanted.""My grandpa had saved Clarissa's grandpa's life. To return the favor, he promised to let his grandson marry me.""""Oh, so you were Leonel's fiancée before? He was okay with our marriage?"" Misael sneered.""He never wanted me. I know my place,"" Cynthia replied.""How old are you?"" he probed.Misael moved to the sofa in the master bedroom and sat down, probably worn out from standing too long.""22.""""Still in school?"" he went on.After a long pause, Cynthia answered, ""I've never been to school.""""What? Never? Don't tell me you didn't even go to kindergarten.""Feeling embarrassed, she fidgeted with the hem of her dress. ""No.""""Oh, isn't that something?"" Misael said, clearly taken aback.""Never expected my wife would be an illiterate. How ridiculous!""Cynthia had had enough. She stood up, took a deep breath, and shot back, ""You don't have to be so mean. I married you at the Sloans' command. Your family agreed to the swap, didn't they? I guess they know not many girls would want a blind husband.""If you're that unhappy, we can call it quits right now. Draft the divorce papers, and I'll go.""""You think that's an option for you?"" Misael asked with a slight frown.""You think you've got better options?"" she fired back, plucking up her courage.Silence stretched between them.Then Misael broke it with a sharp laugh.""You may not have much education, but you sure got a sharp tongue.""Cynthia stayed quiet. She had only agreed to the marriage to get out from under the Sloan family's roof. But he wasn't wrong—divorce wasn't an option. Not yet, at least, not until she found what she was looking for.""You take the bed. I'll crash on the sofa."" Misael was being considerate, though his tone was commanding.""No need. This is your house. I'll take the sofa."" Cynthia stood up slowly, the crystal tiara on her head giving a faint jingle.""Suit yourself. I'm gonna take a shower."" He got up and felt his way toward the bathroom.After a moment of hesitation, Cynthia asked, ""Do you need help?""Her offer came from concern, but Misael took it differently.""Oh? Sure. How exactly do you plan to help?"" he teased, his tone suggestive.She caught the meaning and flushed. Thankfully, he couldn't see it, or he might have laughed at her.""I'm just worried you'll trip or something and I'll get blamed. That's all. Don't get the wrong idea,"" she blurted.""Then how about you bathe me?"" Misael pressed further.""Sure. If you're okay with that,"" she replied, unflinching.""Alright, come on in.""She froze in surprise, unsure what to do.""You can still back out, you know.""Misael chuckled, sensing her hesitation. ""There are consequences for acting tough,"" he thought.Finally, she said, ""No, I've handled tougher things than this. Let's do it.""Cynthia wasn't much of a talker. Her stubborn streak earned her plenty of scolding from her grandpa since she was a child.""It's just a bath. Don't be scared. He's not gonna try anything,"" she told herself.She followed Misael into the bathroom, leaving the door ajar just in case.""Are you gonna help me undress, or you want me to do it?""Misael's question made Cynthia cringe.Now she realized he was just messing with her.Her face hardened as she replied coolly, ""Mr. Schaefer, you're blind, but your hands work just fine, right?""""Fair enough. I'll do it myself."" Then Misael took off his jacket and shirt, revealing his toned upper body with eight-pack abs.Cynthia quickly turned her head away, her cheeks burning red.Noticing her reaction, Misael smirked. ""Get the water temperature right for me, then you can leave.""The earlier suggestion was just a joke.Misael had kept his distance from women for years. Surely he wouldn't let her bathe him.Relieved by his words, Cynthia turned away and bent over the bathtub to adjust the water.In her haste, she bumped into his foot as he stepped into the tub. Then they both tumbled into the bathtub with a loud splash.Cynthia ended up sprawled over him, her hand pressed firmly against his chest.""Mr. Schaefer, your mom asked me to bring you some soup,"" a maid called out.She stopped at the bathroom door, the scene making her jaw drop.""Oh no! Mr. and Mrs. Schaefer, I'm so sorry. I didn't know.""With that, the maid set the tray on the coffee table and bolted.An awkward silence followed.""How long are you planning to stay like this?"" Misael frowned, his tone dripped with sarcasm. ""Didn't you say you didn't wanna marry me? What? Feeling you made the right decision after seeing my abs?""Cynthia rolled her eyes. ""Don't flatter yourself. Sure, you've got abs, but who knows? It's probably a letdown where it really counts.""She tried to pull her hand away, but Misael grabbed her wrist.""You're the first person ever to mock me. Well, want me to prove you wrong right now?""""Let me go! Wait.""In her struggle, Cynthia's fingers brushed against his arm, and something felt off.""Misael, are you sure the car accident caused your blindness?"" she asked, her brows knitted.Misael, sharp as ever, caught the suspicion in her voice. ""What are you implying?""Chapter 2 Second Opinion""I've learned a bit of traditional medicine. I just checked your pulse. Something seems off,"" Cynthia explained.""Didn't you say you never went to school?"" Misael asked, his frown deepening. He had always been suspicious.""I didn't. I learned it on my own while living with my grandpa in the mountains.""""So your grandfather is a traditional doctor?""""He was self-taught too.""""Why wasn't he at our wedding?""""He passed away.""""Oh.""His response was blunt, with no hint of sympathy, but Cynthia let it slide. She just continued, ""Back to your condition, that's just what I feel, believe or not.""""Go on,"" he said.""Mind if I check your pulse again, just to be sure?""Misael didn't say anything, just let her go, and held out his arm.Cynthia sat up and leaned over to take his pulse.She wasn't one to be easily tempted, but being this close to him was unsettling.He looked far more striking in person than in any photo she had seen on TV.Cynthia had heard about Misael and seen those photos during her time with the Sloan family.His family's reputation was impossible to ignore—one of Acriastein's most powerful dynasties.A month ago, Misael visited the Sloan family with engagement gifts.Cynthia wasn't allowed to join the table, but she watched from a distance.The way he carried himself impressed her, though he couldn't get a clear look at his face.Now, with him right in front of her, she found herself unable to look away.""Enjoying it?"" Misael asked sharply. ""If you're done, maybe check my pulse?""Cynthia looked away and closed her eyes to steady herself.Then she pressed her fingers to his strong wrist.Her cool touch sent a faint tingle through him.""The other hand,"" she said softly.""Seriously?"" he grumbled but did as she said.After a moment, Cynthia got slowly to her feet.""So what's the deal?"" Misael asked calmly.""You've been poisoned,"" Cynthia replied.""What?"" That possibility had never crossed his mind.""I'm not a proper doctor,"" she added. ""And no fancy credentials. I'm just speaking from experience. So you don't have to take my word for it.""""Alright, keep going.""""Your pulse tells me that, and it happened less than two weeks ago. It's still active, which is why I can feel it right away.""""What kind of poison?"" Misael asked, curious.""Methanol. Have you been drinking any rotgut lately?""Her words made him chuckle.""Rotgut? Me? Do I look like the kind of guy who'd do that?""""Just saying what I think. Never mind,"" Cynthia huffed.Frustrated by his attitude, she stood abruptly and turned to go.""Wait,"" Misael called out.She stopped and turned around. ""What now?""""If you're really here to help, I'll make sure you're repaid properly. But if you're up to no good, you'll regret it.""That set her off.""Mr. Schaefer, let me remind you. You've been rude since day one.""And for the record, paranoia is a thing. Maybe book yourself a shrink when you get the chance!""With that, she slammed the door behind her.Since losing his sight, his hearing had grown sharper. Misael winced as the bang echoed in his ears.He used to have a fiery temper; any woman acting like this would have been out the door.But now, he held back. There were bigger things to deal with.He grabbed his phone and made a call. ""Get me the autopsy report on the truck driver from the crash. And schedule a full checkup for tomorrow. Bring in some specialists.""Misael stayed in the bathroom for a bit. By the time he came out, Cynthia was already asleep on the bed.He paused, listening to the sound of his even breathing. ""Sleeping like a rock after all that happened,"" he muttered to himself.With a smirk, he stretched out on the sofa and drifted into a light sleep.The next morning, Cynthia woke to find Misael already dressed and sitting motionless on the sofa.The soup from the day before remained untouched, exactly where the maid had left it.Still groggy, she said in a husky voice, ""Morning.""""You're up. Get ready for breakfast,"" he said, his face expressionless.""Okay.""""And put on something nice. We're going downstairs to greet the elders.""""Got it,"" Cynthia replied.She was already bracing for the hassle ahead. Family traditions were always a pain, and even the Sloan family, with their second-tier status, managed to make them theatrical.Clarissa's charm and wit had won over Misael's mother, Madisyn.Without that, the Sloan family would have had no chance at this marriage. Women across the city had been eager to marry Misael.Meanwhile, the Sloan family had been struggling financially for a few years.The Schaefer family's generous offer was just Leonel's lifeline.But in the end, it was Cynthia who made the sacrifice, not Clarissa.Cynthia opened her modest suitcase and took out a light red dress.Without the tiara, she felt freer and lighter.She tied her hair into a ponytail and looked like the lively girl she once was.Downstairs, their families were already gathered around the big rectangular dining table.Cynthia glanced their way as she guided him carefully down the staircase.""They're coming,"" Madisyn said with a bright smile.The newlyweds greeted everyone politely.Natalie Schaefer, in her eighties, brimmed with energy and couldn't hide her joy at seeing her only grandson married.Before she could speak, Misael's aunt Alicia sneered, ""Misael's married an impostor. Shouldn't we reconsider the price?""Alicia stayed sharp-tongued and meddlesome, even after marrying out of the family years ago.Misael's uncle Lamont chimed in, ""They're out of line. The car accident left him blind, fine, but accidents happen. Sending an impostor? That's a real insult to our family.""Their remarks made Cynthia feel out of place. She clenched the hem of her dress, trying to stay composed, but the sting of humiliation was hard to ignore.With a sharp clang, Misael slammed his fork on the table.""Why didn't you guys say this yesterday?""The wedding's done, and the papers are signed. Isn't it a little late now?""If you'd brought it up earlier, I'd think you were calling out the Sloan family.""Now it just feels like you're giving me a hard time.""Alicia exchanged a glance with Lamont and said softly, ""Misael, that's not what I meant. Come on, we're family. I just thought you might feel bad. Even your mom said Clarissa's prettier than Cynthia.""She knew exactly what she was doing. That seemingly innocent explanation just gave Madisyn away.Chapter 3 Get His Sight BackCynthia didn't turn heads the way Clarissa did—Madisyn had said that before.But it was so rude to blurt it out in front of Cynthia.Madisyn gave an awkward smile. ""That's not true. Cynth is pretty too. Come on, both of them are.""""Alright, enough already,"" Natalie snapped. ""Do you seriously have to start this crap so early? Cynthia and Misael are not here for this. Just give them their wedding gifts and shut it.""Natalie only cared about Misael's happiness. It didn't matter to her who he married, as long as he cared for the girl.With a warm smile, Natalie studied Cynthia. ""Cynth is lovely. Look at her round face. She's gonna bring good luck to the family. I like her.""With an elegant gift in hand, she continued warmly, ""Here, this is for you.""Cynthia hesitated, glancing at Misael. Seeing his calm expression, she took it as approval and accepted the gift. ""Thank you, Grandma.""With Natalie backing her up, the room quieted down. Then the rest of the family began handing over their gifts.They were far friendlier than the Sloan family. Breakfast was relaxed, filled with chatter. No one singled out Cynthia or stirred up trouble.After breakfast, Misael headed out.Cynthia went back to the bedroom to catch up on sleep.When she woke up, he was already back.He was sitting quietly on the sofa.""Oh, hey,"" she called out.""Check this out,"" Misael said, pointing to a pile of gift-wrapped packages on the floor.""What's all this?"" she asked curiously.""Clothes, a phone, and a bag.""Cynthia stared in surprise. She was about to ask why he had bought them when he cut her off with a dry tone.""How do you not have a phone in this day and age?""""I don't go to school and have no friends,"" she muttered, eyes fixed on the floor. ""What would I even need one for?""""How did the Sloan family treat you, really? They let you stay for four years.""But they couldn't even get you a phone or proper clothes.""She stayed silent. He was telling the truth.Cynthia had mixed feelings about the Sloan family. The past four years had been calm, but she had mostly stayed out of sight. Sometimes, she even ate with the housekeepers.They never sent her to school, and barely anyone outside the house knew she was the adopted daughter. Her life might have stayed that way if Clarissa hadn't refused to marry Misael.Even Misael had only just learned of Cynthia's existence.He hadn't seen her face yet, but from her voice alone, he figured she was probably plain-looking.""Why are you giving me all these?"" she asked.""Because I don't want you making me look bad,"" he answered.Cynthia rolled her eyes.""My wife shouldn't look pathetic. Just take them. They'll help you at least look the part.""""Thanks."" She wasn't one to turn down kindness out of pride.So she went over, crouched down, and carefully unwrapped the items.Among them was a brand-new pink phone, the latest model.No girl could resist such a charming shade. If Misael hadn't been blind, he might have noticed her eyes light up with joy.The clothes and designer bag didn't excite her.Having grown up in the remote mountains with her grandfather until she turned eighteen, she wasn't drawn to such things. But a phone—she had secretly wished for one for years.But a phone was something she had quietly wished for over the years.Preston Sloan had once suggested giving Cynthia his old phone, but his wife, Kaylynn, had dismissed the idea outright.Whether it was jealousy or something else, Kaylynn said Cynthia didn't need a phone since she had no friends or job.And that was the end of it. Back there, her basic needs were met, but she had never had money of her own. She couldn't work without their permission, and even if she could, her lack of education made it impossible.Even her favorite herbs were left behind.Cynthia held the phone in both hands, feeling overjoyed. She stared at it for a long moment.Misael's voice broke the silence. ""Cynthia, if the poison is methanol, can you cure me?""She turned to look at him.""Everything comes at a price. I knew it. Of course, he expects something in return,"" she thought.""Doctors already told you methanol poisoning causes irreversible damage, didn't they?"" she said calmly.""They did,"" he replied.Earlier, he had visited his private hospital and consulted some top specialists.They confirmed Cynthia's diagnosis and told him the damage to his eyes was permanent.Misael had spent the day stewing in frustration. Back home, he waited in the room for Cynthia to wake, holding onto a faint hope.""So, it really is methanol?"" Cynthia asked.""Yeah,"" he said.""Misael, I've never done clinical trials. Everything I know, I learned from my grandfather. I've never treated anyone for this before. But if you're willing to trust me, I'll give it my best shot,"" she said earnestly.""What do you think my chances are?"" he asked.""I can't say.""""What?"" Disappointment hit him like a blow.She was his last hope, but she couldn't promise anything.""I can't guarantee I'll fix your eyes, but I can try.""""So, I'm just a guinea pig to you?""""Pretty much,"" Cynthia replied, unfazed.Misael's temper flared. He grabbed the new phone and smashed it to the ground. ""Cynthia, do you take me for a fool? I can end you right away if I want to.""""Mr. Schaefer, I didn't poison you or cause the car accident. Let's not forget the facts,"" Cynthia said calmly.The room went stiflingly quiet.Misael had always been proud, volatile, and sharp-edged.Cynthia, on the other hand, was steady and unshaken, never letting her composure falter.Fate brought these two opposites together in a strange twist.""If this treatment doesn't work, am I at risk?"" Misael asked. Somehow, he had managed to set his anger aside.""No. The worst that could happen is you'll stay blind, just like you are now.""""Alright, let's get started right away.""A week without sight was driving him mad; everything felt impossible to do on his own.All he wanted was to see again.""I'll need some herbs,"" Cynthia said.""Fine, write them down, and I'll have someone get them,"" he urged.""You can't find them on the market.""""What do you mean? Are you kidding me?"" he said, frowning again.""Listen, they grow wild in the mountains. They're unnamed plants I can't describe. If it's possible, you can have someone take me there. My old home has the tools I need to make the medicine. It'd be faster that way.""""OK, let's go.""On the second day of their marriage, Misael called it their honeymoon, and they left for Mount Wonderland, Cynthia's hometown.It was just over a hundred kilometers away. By the third day, when they returned, his eyes were fully recovered. What a miracle!That night, in a hut on Mount Wonderland, Misael took the antidote. Within minutes, he opened his eyes slowly, and everything came back into view.""How is it? Can you see now?"" Cynthia asked, cautiously waving her fingers before his eyes.Without a word, Misael pulled her into his arms.When their eyes met, a wave of admiration surged through him.""You can see, right?"" she asked, her voice rising with excitement.Chapter 4 Visiting the Sloan FamilyMisael didn't rush home to share the news of the recovery.Instead, he honored the tradition by visiting the Sloan family.On the way back, Misael made a stop at the city's best shopping mall.He picked out new outfits and hired a stylist for Cynthia.After the makeover, she stared at the mirror, barely recognizing herself.""Mr. Schaefer, are you happy with the look?"" the stylist asked confidently.Misael lounged on the sofa behind her, legs crossed, a cigarette resting between his fingers.He brought it to his lips and demanded, ""Turn around.""Cynthia turned slowly, her head lowered, a hint of shyness in her movements.She had spent eighteen years with her grandfather in the mountains, rarely meeting other people.After moving into the Sloan's home, she barely got noticed and hardly ever went out.And she wasn't even given Clarissa's discarded clothes.The shift from being an unnoticed plain girl to this was just breathtaking.Misael had seen more impressive things and thought he was ready for this, but her transformation still stunned him.For years, he avoided romance, crossing paths with plenty of bombshells, but none came close to Cynthia.The idea that she was less attractive than Clarissa had always hinged on Clarissa's use of makeup and cosmetic tricks to enhance her appearance.Cynthia kept things simple, but with her naturally striking features, a bit of styling turned her into a showstopper.""Yeah, that works. Go ahead and use my card,"" Misael said with a nod.Obviously, he liked the look. Then he handed over a sleek black card from his wallet.Her hair was styled into two braids with subtle detailing.She wore a cocktail dress that fell just below her knees, and its soft color perfectly complemented her skin.For the first time, Cynthia wore jewelry—a delicate pearl necklace with matching earrings.On her left hand was the wedding ring.She didn't know much about diamonds, but she'd heard that size mattered when it came to their worth.Even with a simple wedding, no expense had been spared for Cynthia.Under the soft light, the huge diamond on her ring gleamed.She looked up, meeting Misael's gaze.Then, she turned away without a word.""Cynthia, Leonel never tried anything with you over these four years?"" Misael asked.He wasn't sure why he brought it up. His sharp gaze stayed on her as he waited for an answer.Cynthia was annoyed and thought, ""He should thank me for the treatment, not asking this.""She turned to meet his eyes and shot back, ""If he had, do you think you'd be here now?""Misael glanced at her angry face and couldn't help but chuckle.He was over the moon about his recovery and let her sharp words slide.They arrived at the Sloan's house at noon.The Sloan family was stunned into silence as they saw Misael move around freely.""Misael... you can see again?"" Leonel asked in disbelief.Misael took his time to scan the room and relish their shock.Then he took Cynthia's hand and said, ""Yeah, it's all thanks to Cynthia. She's my lucky star. The day she became my wife, my sight came back.""Clarissa's face fell immediately. The Sloan-Schaefer union had always been about alliances, but she had secretly hoped to marry Misael.With his looks and status unmatched in Acriastein, being his wife meant having everyone's attention and respect.Clarissa thought no one deserved this more than her.But after Misael became blind, Clarissa didn't hesitate to move on.Her wedding was held on the same day as Misael and Cynthia's. But it was grand and lavish.""This can't be real. How could he get his sight back so fast?"" Clarissa thought.She was overwhelmed with anger, disbelief, and sadness.""Misael, how did your eyesight recover?"" she asked, her tone overly sweet as if she cared.To her disappointment, Misael looked down at Cynthia's hand and kissed it gently.What a display of affection. Cynthia knew it was all for show, but the blush on her cheeks gave her away.""I just slept and woke up to find I could see again,"" Misael said casually.""No way,"" Leonel muttered, doubt written all over his face as he glanced between Misael and Cynthia.His eyes lingered on her face for a moment.Back when Cynthia moved in, Leonel barely paid her any attention, dismissing her as a country bumpkin.She usually ate with the housekeepers, so he rarely saw her at meals.Leonel and Clarissa spent their nights partying and clubbing, always sleeping past noon.Leonel often traveled for work, managing the family business with his father.The engagement between him and Cynthia was forgotten after those who created it passed away.And there was nothing legal to hold it together.Now, sitting beside Misael, Cynthia looked completely different.Leonel was struck by how stunning she looked.If he had noticed this before, he would have made her his and never let her end up with someone else.Regret churned in Leonel's and Clarissa's chests.This was exactly the reaction Misael had hoped for by coming today.""Guys, dinner's ready. Chat while we eat,"" Preston said, trying to ease the tension in the room.Throughout the meal, Preston kept putting food on Misael's plate, steering the conversation toward lighter topics.""Cynthia, could you get me some soup?"" Kaylynn asked.It was an excuse to get Cynthia out of the room.Cynthia grabbed a bowl and headed to the kitchen.As soon as she was out of sight, Kaylynn shot Clarissa a meaningful look.Clarissa leaned closer to Misael and whispered, ""Misael, you should go for a check-up at the hospital.""Let's not take any chances.""Kaylynn chimed in smoothly, ""She's right. When you had the accident, she cried so hard she almost passed out. It's a shame you two missed each other.""Misael smirked. ""Oh, really? She just married someone else the very next day.""""Misael, I hate to bring this up, but Seamus McGee set me up. He spiked my drink at the bachelor party. I didn't have a choice,"" Clarissa said, tears welling up in her eyes.""And we owed Cynthia's grandpa a lot. My parents believed in doing the right thing and wanted the best for her. Letting her marry you was how they chose to repay that debt.""""Well, you all are certainly kind and grateful,"" Misael said with a half-smile.""A promise from the older generation carries weight. It's something we have to honor,"" Preston replied, trying to hide his guilt.""Interesting,"" Misael scoffed. ""Because the promise I heard was for Cynthia to marry Leonel. But when he wasn't interested, you passed her off to me instead. Using me to pay off your family debt? Brilliant move, huh?""His words hit hard, leaving the family visibly uneasy.Desperate, Clarissa tried to turn things against Cynthia. ""That's not true, Misael. Cynthia wanted this. When she found out I was engaged to you, she got jealous. Then she used the accident with Seamus to push us into this arrangement. We only agreed to protect your family's reputation. If you're unhappy, you can just divorce her, kick her out, because she's—""""Because she's got no one in the world, right?"" Misael cut her off and glared at her.Cynthia walked back in with the bowl of soup and placed it in front of Kaylynn. ""Here's your soup.""""Thanks, sweetheart,"" Kaylynn said, her voice dripping with fake warmth.Leonel gave Cynthia a thoughtful look, and a lousy idea crossed his mind.""Mr. Schaefer, if you're unhappy, you can always send her back. We looked after her for years. We don't mind doing it again.""""Don't be ridiculous. She's my wife. Sending her back here would make us the talk of the town. Besides, you're not her real family,"" Misael shot back.""If we hadn't taken her in, she'd have ended up on the streets. She wouldn't have the comfort she has now,"" Leonel said defensively.""Oh, right. Four years under your roof—and no phone, no school? That's some 'comfort.'""The family of three froze, wondering if Cynthia had told Misael that.""Even housekeepers get paid, don't they? What have you guys given her?"" Misael added with an unreadable smile.""Cynthia, tell us. How did we treat you?"" Leonel asked, his eyes fixed on her.""Be honest, Cynthia. It's okay,"" Kaylynn said, giving her a warning look.""Yeah, Cynthia, tell Mr. Schaefer how it was. Nothing but truth,"" Preston added, looking nervous.All eyes were on her now. She glanced at Misael, seeking a sense of security.Chapter 5 She's GorgeousCynthia gave a faint smile. ""Everyone has been great to me. Otherwise, they wouldn't have given me such a good opportunity to marry Mr. Schaefer. I'm truly grateful.""Cynthia's answer was impeccable, yet it was a slap in the face to the Sloan family.Because everyone knew the only reason Cynthia got to marry Misael was that Clarissa didn't want to.When Clarissa heard that Misael had gone blind in a car accident, she did everything she could to avoid marrying him. She even went as far as having a one-night stand with the son of a real estate tycoon, Seamus, and made sure it was photographed and made public.It was only because Clarissa rejected him that Cynthia ended up with Misael.But on the surface, no one could tear off the polite masks just yet. And they couldn't even tell whether Cynthia's words were genuine or sarcastic.Misael smiled, ""I'm grateful too. If Cynth hadn't come into my life, my eyes wouldn't have been cured.""""Misael..."" Clarissa was pissed that she had actually let such a good opportunity slip.If she had known Misael's eyes would recover this quickly, she would never have married that loser Seamus!""Clarissa, the way you address me is inappropriate."" Misael gave her a cold glance.""Come on, let's eat, everyone.""Preston cut in, covering for his daughter's inappropriate thoughts.""Cynth, why don't you stay the night with Mr. Schaefer? We've prepared a room for you two,"" Kaylynn offered enthusiastically, clearly with an agenda.""Kaylynn, I—"" Cynthia was just about to decline.""Sure, no problem. We'll stay the night,"" Misael answered smoothly.Cynthia gave him a quick look, surprised. His expression revealed nothing.Cynthia had been glad to get away from this family. She'd rather stay at the Schaefer's residence.But Misael had already made the decision. There was no changing it now.After dinner, Kaylynn had the maid prepare a guest room, even swapping in high-end bedding before letting them in. Once inside, Misael glanced around.""This isn't your old room, is it?""""No.""""Thought so. They'd never give you a room this nice.""""I'm used to it. It doesn't matter where I sleep,"" Cynthia replied calmly.Sitting on the big bed, Misael looked at Cynthia's delicate face. ""You talk back to me sharp as a blade, so you don't seem like someone who'd suffer silently. Tell me, Ms. Bonilla, do you have a hidden side I don't know about? Or maybe secrets no one else knows?""""Misael, stop with the sarcasm. If you've got something to say, just spit it out.""""Haha. You were so sweet and docile in front of the Sloan family, but in front of me, you're a little wildcat. I like wildcats better.""His words made Cynthia's cheeks flush again.""I don't have time for your nonsense. Are you using the bathroom or not? I'm going to shower.""Misael silently gestured for her to go ahead.Cynthia turned and entered the bathroom, starting to remove her makeup. She really wasn't used to being this dressed up.Sitting in the walk-in closet connected to the bathroom, Cynthia slowly removed her earrings, deep in thought.She'd been in the Sloan family for four years and still hadn't found the orb.Would Misael help her?After all, she'd healed his eyes, and that meant he owed her big time.But Misael was extremely suspicious by nature. He was way harder to deal with than Leonel.How could she convince him to help without making him suspect anything?After her shower, Cynthia realized awkwardly that she had no clothes there.Left with no choice, she wrapped herself in a bathrobe and tiptoed back to her old room to see if she had any old clothes left.Unexpectedly, she was blocked at the door by Leonel.""What are you doing?"" a familiar voice sounded from behind.""I'm looking for my clothes."" She pointed to the room she used to live.Leonel didn't say anything, looking Cynthia up and down.Wearing a bathrobe and with her makeup removed, she somehow looked even more dazzling.It was strange, really. Cynthia had been living in the Sloan's house for four years, right under his nose.But today was the first time he realized she was this beautiful.Even more beautiful than any of the flings he'd had over the past few years.Now, Cynthia was in a white bathrobe, her long hair still damp.Her bare face was refreshing and delicate. He couldn't take his eyes off her.In that instant, Leonel came to a conclusion: During those four years, Cynthia had deliberately downplayed her looks, avoiding him, maybe even guarding herself against him.Thinking that, he took a step forward to test his theory.Sure enough, Cynthia immediately stepped back.""Cynth, are you afraid of me?"" Leonel's voice took on a seductive tone.Even his voice had become husky and charming. It was nothing like how he used to talk to her.In fact, in the past four years, he'd never once called her Cynth.""Not at all. You're overthinking.""""Then why did you dodge?""""I just think men and women should keep a respectful distance. Besides, I'm already Misael's wife. It's best you maintain some boundaries.""""Cynth, I was the one engaged to you."" He leaned in closer, lowering his voice.""So what?"" Cynthia sneered.""I've always been against you marrying Misael. Our family could've called off the engagement. But you know my parents. They wouldn't dare offend the Schaefer family. So you understand the dilemma I was in, right?""""I do,"" Cynthia replied with a smile, gazing at this hypocritical man.""I never wanted you to marry anyone else. Seeing you now makes it even harder for me. Cynth, you were supposed to be my fiancée. I really wanted to protect you.""""It's highly inappropriate for you to say these things now, Mr. Sloan. Where were you three days ago?""Noticing her tone turning confrontational, Leonel narrowed his eyes.Sure enough, this woman had been pretending to be timid and cautious for the past four years.""Do you think now that Misael married you, you've got someone to protect you?""You're just an uneducated woman with no power or connections. Do you really think Misael cares? Or the Schaefer family? You don't actually believe marrying into their family makes you one of them, do you?""""How funny,"" Cynthia fired back. ""Whether my husband cares about me or not has nothing to do with you. If you're delusional, go see a doctor. There's no point in putting on a performance here. I'm not a fan of theater.""""Oh?"" Leonel was provoked.""Let me put it this way—if I were to do something to you right now, Misael wouldn't step in. Because in his eyes, you're worthless.""As he spoke, his hand reached toward Cynthia's shoulder.Cynthia was wondering if she should fight back when a cold voice came from behind them.""Who said I wouldn't step in?""The next second, Leonel was grabbed by strong hands, spun around, and punched hard in the face.Cynthia froze. It was Misael.When had he gotten there? And how much of their conversation had he overheard?Chapter 6 Make Them Divorce""Why the violence, Mr. Schaefer?"" Leonel wiped the blood from his lips, smirking.""Stay away from her. You think trash like you can lay a hand on what's mine?"" Misael shot him an icy glare.""Don't be so tense. I was just joking with Cynth.""""Save the jokes. If you want to keep breathing, stay in your lane. I won't repeat myself.""Misael then grabbed Cynthia's hand. ""Let's go.""""But I haven't found my clothes yet—"" Cynthia protested, remembering why she'd come to her old room.""Forget those rags. They're worthless anyway.""Misael scowled, irritated by the thought of Cynthia's cheap belongings.After Misael took Cynthia away, Leonel leaned against the hallway, lit a cigarette, and chuckled.Inside the room.""Flirting with Leonel is not the smartest move. You know his reputation in Acriastein. Aren't you afraid of catching something?""Cynthia's temper flared. ""When did I flirt with him?!""""You went out in a bathrobe, hair still dripping...""""If you call that flirting, then we have nothing to discuss."" Cynthia stormed into the bathroom to blow dry her hair.Though Misael had stepped in to help her earlier, she felt no gratitude.She could've handled Leonel herself.Besides, saving her didn't give him the right to mock her. His venomous tongue made her angry, and she vowed to keep her distance.After drying her hair, Cynthia was tired.To cure Misael's eyes, they had made a trip back to Mount Wonderland.Traveling a long distance, gathering herbs, and making medicine had drained her.So, she wanted to go to bed early. But when she stepped out, she found Misael already sprawled on the bed, shirtless.The guest room had only one bed and no sofa.""You can sleep on the floor if you want, but there's no extra blanket,"" Misael remarked casually, scrolling through his phone.Cynthia was angry.""Why should I sleep on the floor?!""""I'm not sleeping there either. The cold bothers me,"" Misael replied.""And it doesn't bother me?!""""Then get on the bed. Stop complaining.""""I...""Cynthia gritted her teeth, climbing cautiously onto the bed.She tugged at the blanket.But she yanked too hard, pulling it entirely off Misael.Misael was wearing nothing but briefs.Cynthia immediately turned away, cheeks burning.""What do you want to do with me, Ms. Bonilla?"" he teased.""It was an accident! I just wanted the blanket!""""If you've got needs, I'm free tonight. Happy to oblige.""""Spare me.",1,1745375651.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

Maybe that’s what love is; not the fire, not the chaos, but the tenderness of finally being met. *Of being known without needing to be explained*.

You are not near me, and still, I carry you; in the moments before sleep, in the quiet after the world has gone still, in the songs I skip straight to the chorus, in the coffee that never quite tastes as good without your name in the morning. I have never touched your skin, and still, I swear, my hands remember you.

Isn’t that something? To miss what you’ve never had. To ache for someone like they’ve already lived a hundred lifetimes between galaxies. I look at my reflection and see pieces of you in all the places I’ve softened. And yet, I haven’t traced your fingertips. I haven’t mapped your smile with mine. But I love you, fully. Without waiting for permission. Without needing proof. Without condition. 

People don’t understand how distance can hold something so sacred. But you and I? We existed beyond logic. Beyond explanation. You were not an idea. You were not a maybe. You are here, still, in the shape of every word I haven’t written yet, in the pause between my sentences, in the spaces that no longer feel empty.

I love you, still, in a way that has nothing to do with time. Nothing to do with space. Only everything to do with truth. With energy. With gravity. You pulled at something in me I forgot was alive. And I would wait lifetimes for a touch that feels the way your presence always did.

This is not a beginning. This is not an ending. This is a remembering.

*And God — I remember you everywhere*.

1k5oe03,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1k5oe03/creepy_teacher/,Creepy teacher,"My English teacher (male) has made many girls in my grade very uncomfortable and idk what to do about it. For reference I'm in 10th grade and am 15 turning 16 so it's really weird. It all started when we came into class last school year (I'd be in 9th grade then) and he had us record ourselves doing a play, makes sense for an English class but the problem was he was recording without asking parents permission and not just recording the time we were acting but the whole class. He got called out for it and it was taken to admin but they ended up doing nothing about it. This school year he did it again and this time I made sure to have my mom sign the slip saying I can't be recorded at all unless it's pictures for yearbook, he never asked my mom or my friends mom who has the same paper signed to record and basically did the whole thing again but we write our own scripts and then act them out. We only got to do one script tho and it was my friends who got chosen and she didn't recognize her own story but that's another thing. She knew I didn't feel comfortable being recorded by said teacher so she never called on me to be an actor in his play thingy, while he was recording our class he was also joking about the previous incident where he got caught recording the whole period but nothing got done. We (friend and i) ended up reporting him to admin about it and they said technically they can't do anything. (Idk if this next part would be considered sfw so read at your own risk but I need advice so idk where else to put it) Fast forward to today I came into class without friend and noticed hello kitty drawings on the board there were two but one was of buff hello kitty but she had no sports bra or shirt on.Uncomfortable already. Went the whole period thinking it's fine I can just get through the rest of the day but then he holds me after class so he can talk to me about something. I'm thinking great it's probably about me rolling my eyes in class (he makes kids who audibly yawn write an essay about how disrespectful it is) he tells me I know your feelings about me and this classroom (I've been rolling my eyes and giving attitude in class) you make it very clear.I also want to talk to you about the test you missed. I said what test did I miss? He responds the one from last quarter that u scored 2 points on. ( this was early in the quarter so I still have no idea which test he's talking about) he says I wanted you to know that I wasn't sitting behind you during that test to make sure you weren't cheating or anything I was making myself a cup of coffee (he has a coffee maker in his class) so there was no need for you to answer 2 questions then leave. I responded that's not why I left so quickly. He asks why I did. I said I had prior comintments that day and I wasn't going to wait an hour after school to take a test. He said I wasn't going to make you wait an hour, I said you made me wait 30 mins to even start the test I came in at 1 45 to take the test and you snapped at me and told me to wait till 2 15 to come into class and take the test. He (starting to raise his voice) said I didnt do that. I snapped back with yes you did. Again while he's starting to yell at me said we'll I was going to let you retake it but I guess that opertunity has passed. I said well I didn't want to retake it anyways that was last quarter (grade books are closed from then and I had genuinely forgotten about it) if I had wanted to take it again I would've asked. He started to raise his voice and yap about something like we'll that opportunity has passed but I was going to let you retake it with a bunch more yapping. I had my other class to get to (5 min passing period) and I had a min to get to my next class so I looked at my watch and said are you done because I have other classes to get to. He then got upset that I dare walk out of his class before he was done talking yadda yadda but I just turned around and left. All these things has happened with hin and admin hasn't done anything and doesnt care about student reports so idk whether I should report him again for the topless hello kitty or for the conversation we had when nothing has been getting done about it. But my mom's on my side and wants me to just skip his class but I cant do that cause it's English but idk what to do anymoreAlso when we were doing the play things he was wanting us to write about 8 kids who are friends ans 1 is stealing from the others parents but he also said something to the affect of make it strange and one way you could do that is write about insest, have them all be related and some like each other, maybe even have them kiss because the strangest parts of life is what give it its meaning",1,1745375251.0,Advice,4,1.0,False

Isn’t that something? To miss what you’ve never had. To ache for someone like they’ve already lived a hundred lifetimes between galaxies. I look at my reflection and see pieces of you in all the places I’ve softened. And yet, I haven’t traced your fingertips. I haven’t mapped your smile with mine. But I love you, fully. Without waiting for permission. Without needing proof. Without condition. 

People don’t understand how distance can hold something so sacred. But you and I? We existed beyond logic. Beyond explanation. You were not an idea. You were not a maybe. You are here, still, in the shape of every word I haven’t written yet, in the pause between my sentences, in the spaces that no longer feel empty.

I love you, still, in a way that has nothing to do with time. Nothing to do with space. Only everything to do with truth. With energy. With gravity. You pulled at something in me I forgot was alive. And I would wait lifetimes for a touch that feels the way your presence always did.

This is not a beginning. This is not an ending. This is a remembering.

*And God — I remember you everywhere*.

After winning yet another lawsuit, Jasmine Black was having a drink with her colleagues at the bar.

She was hammered when she noticed her rival, Diego Cooper, sitting at the opposite table.

Diego was a prominent lawyer worldwide. He was regarded as the industry's formidable devil. He had never once lost a case.

He's also the bastard that Jasmine had pursued from high school until she graduated from university.

She had pursued him for seven long years, yet he remained indifferent and heartless toward her.

Jasmine abruptly sprang up from her seat and staggered toward Diego. With one flop, she sat straight on his lap.

She grabbed his necktie with one hand while resting the other against his toned abs.

""Diego Cooper… Have you become bad in bed?""

Diego didn't stop her as he reclined against the back of the couch. Instead, he stared at her wordlessly.

""You're not answering… So, does that mean… it's true?""

Something flickered in his eyes as he quickly removed her hand.

""Don't you care about your reputation anymore? All your colleagues are here.""

His deep voice was slightly hoarse.

Their colleagues gaped at them in disbelief, impressed by Jasmine's bravery.

""What reputation? I had mine ruined a long time ago because of you!"" a drunk Jasmine grumbled before biting his neck.

All her high school and university classmates knew she spent a lot of money to win Diego's heart, only to fail miserably in the end.

After graduating from university, she was crestfallen and went abroad. She swore she would one day beat Diego in something he was best at.

When she returned to the country six months ago, she was already a famous lawyer with a winning streak dating back to the beginning of her career.

She was beginning to drawl.

While wearing a frown, Diego pulled the back of her collar to create distance between them.

His eyes were dark and indecipherable.

""You've drank too much, Jasmine. Have someone take you home.""

""No! I want you to take me home!""

She yanked his necktie. Her imperative tone sounded slightly coquettish.

He removed her hands from his tie so he could loosen it. Then, he grabbed her by the arm before walking outside without saying a word.

Their colleagues' eyes widened.

Everyone in the legal and political world knew Jasmine and Diego were on bad terms.

They tried to figure out the scene they had just witnessed.

When they reached the car, Jasmine wrapped her arms around Diego's neck and planted a kiss on his neck, sending a slight tremor down his spine.

He held her by the waist and shoved her away.

""This is sexual harassment, Jasmine Black. Do you think I won't sue you for this?""

His tone rose.

""If you're really bad in bed, then forget it. I'll just find someone by the street to release my sexual frustration.""

She then ignored him and waved at a passing man.

""Hey, hot guy! Wanna get a room together?""

Jasmine seemed serious about the invitation.

Diego's expression darkened as he watched her antics. He pressed her waving hand down and opened the car door to shove her in.

Then, he drove the car back home.

…

The next morning, Jasmine woke up and turned her head stiffly.

Diego was sitting next to her, smoking. He appeared laid-back.

Despite his charming looks, he had a dominating and intimidating presence about him.

The grogginess that clouded her mind disappeared in a heartbeat.

Did she finally manage to have sex with him after almost seven years?

""Morning, Mr. Cooper,"" she said.

Jasmine propped herself up, returning to her professional composure as a lawyer.

""Wash up. Someone will serve breakfast in a while.""

Diego discarded his cigarette into the ashtray.

""I'll forgo it. I have a client to meet in the morning.""

Aloofness seeped into her voice.

She lifted the sheets and was about to get out of bed when an idea crossed her mind.

She suddenly grabbed her phone from the headboard, smiling mischievously.

""How about a picture for memory's sake?""

Before Diego could say anything, Jasmine quickly launched the camera app on her phone and lay her head against his sturdy chest.

She flashed a triumphant smile, raised the phone high, and took a selfie of her and Diego.

The picture was rather suggestive as they were naked and were only covered with a blanket.

She sent it to her best friend alongside a voice message.

""Becky Dobbs, tell those people to wire the money to me. I won the bet. Oh, and the payment should include ten years of interest.""

Since she had lost her reputation, she thought she should make some money to make up for it.

The shrewd Diego caught the point of the message.

He asked with a smirk, ""The bet was about me?""

Turning around, she plastered herself to his chest while drawing circles on his abs with her finger. She couldn't resist it.

Jasmine looked at Diego with beady eyes.

""Why are you so surprised? I thought you've known all this while. Oh, and about what happened last night, it was consensual. It was simply an adult game. You don't have to take any responsibility.""

She felt the years she spent pursuing him were a loop of disappointment and heartbreaks. Continuing to be his devoted admirer would be a foolish decision.

Sleeping and then dumping Diego had always been on her wishlist.

""You're wild, Ms. Black.""

Chuckling, he glanced at her and pushed her away.

Due to his handsome looks, a mere glance from him was enough to paralyze her with a tingling sensation.

Jasmine thought Diego was a bastard who was good at seducing.

His push caused her to fall backward, but she managed to support herself with both palms on the bed.

Her tress cascaded over her shoulders, revealing her exposed body and seductive curves.

Jasmine had a stunning body.

Diego's eyes studied her up and down. The fact that his heart skipped a beat made him frown.

""Did you sleep with me because you might like me?""

She casually brushed her slightly curled hair. Picking up her shirt and bra, she began to take her time to dress herself.

""Do you think that's even possible?""

He cast a cold glance at her.

Diego's answer didn't surprise her one bit. Regardless, it didn't bother her because she was determined to be the one who dumped him this time.

Right then, her phone began ringing from the flood of incoming messages. Jasmine checked her phone. They were from Becky.

""Did you really sleep with Mr. Cooper? How? This is too sudden. You failed to take him down in those ten years, though.""

Becky was more excited than Jasmine was.

Smiling, Jasmine quickly replied, ""I'll feed you the details later.""

Diego's phone kept ringing as well. He grabbed it and opened his WhatsApp.

His high school and university group chats exploded with texts.

Everyone was mind-blown by the news.

""Jasmine Black had sex with Diego Cooper?""

Jasmine's body stiffened when she saw the message in the group chat. She didn't expect it to have such a huge impact.

Fortunately, she was close with the people in the group chats. There were only about 30 people in each group, which wasn't many.

She replied to the message, ""It was just a one-night stand. Those who had made a bet with me—you know who you are—wire the money to me.""

Her response elicited a faint smile from Diego, but his eyes reflected coldness as he watched her.

She glimpsed at him—that alone was enough to cause a chill to run down her spine.

""I bet you can't sleep with him for a second time. I'm betting double the amount on this.""

Their university friends copied and pasted the exact message.

The situation was crazy.

""Not only can I sleep with him twice, but thrice. Players, be prepared with your money!"" she texted back with gusto.

Backing off? Not a chance! She'd never do that to embarrass herself.

The smile on Diego's face widened, but he looked like he was going to devour her alive.

His best friend, Jesse Taylor, sent a text message.

""Mr. Cooper sent a lawyer to prison a few days ago. Mark my words—it was a 20-year sentence! Good luck, Ms. Black.""

Jasmine read that message and looked at Diego, who began smoking on the bed again. She couldn't read his emotions because the cloud of smoke covered his features.

Arching her brow, she replied to Jesse, ""Oh really? I'm looking forward to the day when I meet Mr. Cooper in court.""

She then shifted her attention away from the chat, smiling and waving at Diego.

""I should get going, Mr. Cooper. Thanks for the hard work last night. Get some rest.""

Despite his faint smile, Diego suddenly pinched the cigarette between his fingers.

Chapter 2

In the afternoon, Jasmine noticed Diego as soon as she entered the cafe.

The surprise was brief as she immediately wore a professional smile.

""What are the odds, Mr. Cooper?""

""Zero. I'm simply granting your wish.""

Smiling, he placed his cup of coffee on the table before reclining on the couch with his legs crossed.

""Wow… Thank you for your service?""

She gladly took a seat opposite him.

Jasmine's client was a university friend who was also in the group chat they shared.

The case was about a prestigious family in the city that went bankrupt due to internal conflicts.

Diego's expression remained the same. He didn't respond to her remarks either.

""Be a man, Fabian Dawson. We divorced three years ago, and you want half of my money?"" Daisy Freeman, dressed in a sexy red dress, growled at Fabian.

""You've only managed to come this far because of the huge sum of money I spent on you. Don't you even feel guilty about it?"" he questioned.

Fabian needed the money to rise again.

""Why must I—""

Before Daisy could finish her thought, Jasmine crossed her legs and interrupted, ""If you guys think a fight can get you somewhere, what's the use of hiring a lawyer?""

The dispute stopped.

Jasmine looked at Diego indifferently.

""Mr. Cooper, as you know, although it was signed, the divorce agreement won't be effective as long as the divorce procedures have not proceeded. The law states that a divorced couple should split matrimonial assets in half. The same goes for the debts.""

Diego asked, ""Mr. Dawson, is it true that you had an affair while still married and had sex with your mistress many times?""

Fabian smirked and shook his leg, completely unbothered.

Meanwhile, Jasmine turned to look at Fabian in surprise. He hadn't told her any of that.

Fabian blurted, ""Fuck! What kind of man—""

Jasmine gave him a look and averted the question.

""Evidence, Mr. Cooper?""

Jasmine had clearly informed Fabian before this that the conversation would be recorded whenever the lawyers met.

She wondered if he was out of his mind as he almost let this tongue slip.

Daisy huffed, ""I witnessed him get a room with a model.""

""Ms. Freeman, did Mr. Cooper not explain what evidence is?""

Jasmine smiled, relieved at the thought that the other party didn't have proof.

Fabian snorted.

""I have a mistress? You're talking as though you don't have a boy toy. I also wonder how many businessmen you have slept with all these years.""

""It was after we signed the divorce agreement that I—""

Diego glimpsed at the foolish Daisy before interrupting her, ""Please show the evidence before you speak.""

As mentioned at the beginning of the conversation, the divorce agreement was null and void. How could Daisy admit that she had a boy toy?

Was she trying to divorce without getting a single penny out of it? Diego thought Daisy was an idiot.

Jasmine's judging eyes landed on Fabian, who knew that his wife had someone on the side but didn't gather any evidence about it.

She massaged her forehead, fully aware of the road ahead.

Diego questioned, ""Mr. Dawson, you and my client have been living separately for three years. You didn't fulfill your duty as a husband. What have you been doing all these years?""

""I—""

Jasmine shrewdly replied, ""He has been working hard to give Ms. Freeman a better life. However, his legal wife withholds the matrimonial assets. He doesn't have any money while going through a rough patch. Ultimately, his business announced its bankruptcy. If this case is brought to court, don't think of taking a single penny, Mr. Cooper.""

Diego retorted, ""Is this a threat, Ms. Black? His bankruptcy has nothing to do with my client. You can look into it.""

He looked at Daisy, who also didn't share the information with him.

This was the first time he was going against Jasmine at work, and it was a surprising case at that.

""Speaking of, you can also look into this, Mr. Cooper. My client bought his wife multiple houses and luxury cars worth millions of dollars altogether. Ms. Freeman didn't fork up a single penny before and after his business went bankrupt.

""Controlling the matrimonial assets, refusing to pay off shared debts, and having a male companion… Mr. Cooper, you and your client should seriously consider splitting the assets equally or taking this matter to court.""

Jasmine slightly leaned forward, smiling at Diego.

…

""Before the divorce is settled, keep those women at arm's length. Don't give Diego or your wife any other ammunition. Also, eliminate any records, pictures, messages of hotel room bookings, and whatnot,"" Jasmine reminded Fabian while driving the car.

""Got it.""

Fabian was deeply impressed by her.

The thought of meeting Daisy to obtain funds was humiliating to him, but the way Jasmine bombarded the opposing party gave him confidence.

He was all puffed up.

""Is your wife living with her boy toy?"" Jasmine inquired.

""Yeah, it's been three years.""

He crossed his arms, snorting.

""That's good news for us.""

She smirked as she suddenly pulled over by the road.

""Get back home and install a surveillance camera at her place. Tell her that it's to… prevent burglary.""

""I don't think she'll let me in.""

The couple had been living separately for three years. Daisy had bought that mansion herself.

""Idiot! You're still her husband on paper. Is it wrong to return to your home? Plus, she should currently be with Diego.""

""Alright, I'll go now.""

Fabian thought, ""Don't blame me for this, Daisy. I've treated you so well and spent so much money on you. How could you be this cruel to me!""

…

That night, Jasmine received a call from Fabian after she finished showering.

""Diego is going to sue me for bribing him!""

His words came out in a rush.

Jasmine rolled her eyes.

""Well, did you do that?""

""He called me at night and told me he found that model. I was so scared. I met him, hoping he would cut me some slack for old times' sake. I even gave him a check of one million dollars—""

""You idiot! That's a trap! He could bring a woman over and accuse you of having slept with her before, but no one would buy it as long as he doesn't have evidence.

""Oh Lord, someone like you will surely lose everything before you take the divorce case to the courthouse. An idiotic teammate is definitely more harmful than a powerful opponent.""

Jasmine crossed her arms and shook her head.

""Yes, yes, yes, I'm an idiot. You gotta save me, Jasmine! That jerk, Diego, doesn't even care that we were once friends. Gosh, I'm livid!""

""You can be sentenced up to 15 years for bribing a lawyer. It's almost impossible to be announced not guilty of this charge. How am I supposed to help you?""

""W-Well, I don't mind going to prison. But the main thing is, your first loss will be because of Diego! Not only is your reputation at stake, but other lawyers and your friends will never let you live it down!""

Fabian attempted to earn her pity.

Jasmine paced back and forth in her room while reminding him seriously, ""I repeat, do not meet your wife's lawyer without my presence. Think before you speak whenever you talk to her. Don't fall for her schemes. Got it?""

""I'll keep that in mind. But how are you going to—""

He was about to ask her about the possible bribery lawsuit, but the call was terminated.

…

The next morning, Jasmine headed to Cooper, Taylor & Associates.

The receptionist asked, ""Ms. Black, what—""

""I'm Mr. Cooper's girlfriend,"" blurted Jasmine without stopping in her tracks.

The employees were stunned to see her there. Rumors about her and Diego had been circling within the law firm for the past two days.

She read the sign on the door before knocking and opening it without waiting for Diego's signal.

Diego, who was reading some documents, looked up at her expressionlessly.

""Is there anything, Ms. Black?""

He sounded aloof.

Jasmine's hair was let loose over her black professional attire. Her three-inch black high heels were supposed to add more professionalism to her appearance, but it made her look alluring instead.

She walked up next to him before flopping onto his office table seductively. With one hand, she easily grabbed his necktie.

""Giving me the cold treatment already? We just slept together two days ago, though.""

Chapter 3

Diego snatched back his tie from Jasmine's hands while chuckling.

""You must be here because of Fabian's bribery.""

""Of course not. I'm here to… talk about our relationship, not work.""

She pulled at his necktie again, playing with it while faking a smile.

""You want me to sleep with you again? So you can brag about it in the group and rake in big money?""

He slapped her hand away.

He crossed his arms to lean against the back of his chair and arched a brow at her.

Jasmine slid down from the table to sit on his lap. The transition she made was smooth.

Her warm breath brushed against his ears as she giggled.

""Honestly, I was too drunk to remember what happened that night. I kind of want to relive it again…""

Diego's ears turned red. He pushed Jasmine and stared at her. He thought she was shameless.

""Uphold your dignity, Jasmine Black.""

""I've misplaced it. Mind finding it for me?""

Jasmine rested against his chest lazily.

Her finger traced along his perfect neckline.

""I never knew that you were this pretentious, Mr. Cooper. You were so mean that night, as if it was your first time seeing a woman. Why are you pretending to be free from lust now?""

The cheeky movement of her finger gave him a faint jolt of electricity, and he slapped her hand away.

""What are you trying to imply right now? Who was the one who said that it was a mere game so heartlessly that day?""

Jasmine wished she could slap herself—no, Fabian—at this moment. She felt that it was all that idiot's fault.

Had it not been for him, she wouldn't have needed to flatter Diego.

""Why take it to the heart when those were mere heartless words? Since we've slept together, why don't we just date?""

She took shamelessness to a whole new level.

""Sorry, but I don't date heartless people. Torturing myself is not my thing.""

Diego shoved Jasmine off his lap.

Jasmine gnashed her teeth in rage. How dare he claim that dating her was torture!

It took everything in her to build up her reputation and the confidence to stand before him with pride.

But why must she debase herself for him again?

She thought Diego was one merciless and stubborn man.

Given her pretty looks, voluptuous body, elite profession, and background, men lined up to be her partner.

Yet, she had to work hard to wear him down.

She stood up straight and massaged her forehead to regain her cool momentarily.

Then, she made a graceful turn and crossed her arms, smiling.

""Are you sure you want that, jerk?""

Diego ignored her and pressed a button on his landline.

""Callie, come in and escort Ms. Black to make payment.""

He pointed and glanced at the door.

""Ms. Black, I charge ten thousand dollars per consultation hour. Please make the payment outside.""

She nodded before suddenly removing and tossing her black coat onto his table. She strode toward the door while unbuttoning her shirt and ruffling her hair.

""It's only ten thousand dollars. Don't worry. I will pay and ask your secretary to… buy something.""

Diego finally showed traces of uneasiness at her actions. He sprang up from his seat and ran over to the door.

When she opened the door, he quickly slammed it shut again by caging her against it.

His eyelids fluttered at the pleasing view before him, and he looked away.

""Why are you here?""

Jasmine scanned the office, concerned that he would record the conversation secretly. After all, no one knew what he had up his sleeves, considering how cautious he was.

Daisy was at a disadvantage, which was why Diego set Fabian up.

If Jasmine fell for Diego's trap, too, she would lose the case and be sent to prison. She would be the joke of the century if that came to pass.

""I'm here to talk about us.""

She flashed him a smile, attempting to have him wrapped around her finger first.

Right then, the door suddenly opened. Callie turned her head only to see the duo engaged in an intimate scene. Her jaw almost fell to the floor.

Diego, who wielded impactful influence in the political and business worlds, always prioritized work over anything else.

His methods were ruthless and shrewd. Nothing could make him bat an eye, not even a murder.

On the subject of chivalry and love, he didn't have the emotional intelligence for either of those.

Callie couldn't believe what she was witnessing.

""Get out,"" Diego instructed Callie.

""Y-Yes. Don't worry, Mr. Cooper. I saw absolutely nothing.""

Callie covered her eyes.

When he was about to close the door, Jasmine deliberately called out to her.

""Don't leave so quickly. Could you help us buy something we really need right now?""

She gave her a meaningful look.

""Huh?""

The baffled expression on Callie's face gave way to shock and awkwardness once she comprehended the situation.

""S-Sure. I'll go right now.""

She slid out of the door and closed it.

Jasmine chuckled.

""Your secretary is sensible and funny.""

Diego pulled away from her to get her coat. A crease knitted between his brows.

""Enough fooling around. Are you going to leave dressed or naked? If you want the latter, I'm happy to lend you a helping hand.""

""Try me.""

She cocked her brow as she didn't believe Diego's words.

As soon as she finished speaking, Diego threw the coat to one side and stripped her of her shirt.

Before she could react, he pulled her into his arms and trailed his fingers on her back.

Completely flustered, she covered her chest.

""What are you doing, jerk? Do you think you're the only one with guts here?""

She became agitated and caught the secret pin of his belt and pressed it. The belt dangled in midair.

Something dark was churning in his eyes as he stared at her.

Right then, a knock resounded on the door, and the doorknob twisted.

Before the person could open the door, Diego pushed back against it.

""Don't come in!""

He withdrew his hand to wear his belt.

""Get dressed already!""

""I thought you wanted me to leave naked. Why are you stopping me now? Because you don't want others to see?""

Chapter 4

Diego was rendered speechless. He gave Jasmine a cold look before returning to his table to bury himself in the documents, ignoring her.

Jasmine swiftly dressed herself and opened the door to leave.

But Jesse Taylor—their old friend—was holding some documents by the door.

He arched his brows at her.

""Why didn't you let me in? What… were you guys doing in there?""

""Take a guess.""

Jasmine put on a serious face while brushing her hair.

""Did you sleep with him again? I will only pay when I see the proof!""

""Knock on the door at the right time next time.""

She said that intentionally before leaving.

Diego raised his head to watch her leave. Her antics frustrated him.

…

Jasmine returned to her office in the afternoon.

An offer came in. It was a request for her to represent a huge company. She would be paid handsomely for the job.

When the boss left, Fabian, who had been waiting for a long time, immediately entered her office.

""Be honest with me. How much do you earn annually? You have so many clients.""

""Have you installed the surveillance camera?""

Jasmine watered the orchids in her office nonchalantly. She thought it was a bad idea to reveal her income to outsiders.

""I've done it. But Daisy's boy toy hasn't visited her mansion for two days. I bet Diego has reminded her about it.""

""There's no rush in this.""

Jasmine was calm.

""Do you have any solutions to resolve the bribery incident?"" Fabian asked concernedly.

She fell silent.

Diego had the evidence that could prove Fabian's bribery attempt, but he didn't file a lawsuit for it.

She wondered what Diego was up to. Was he trying to play with her more?

If so, she didn't mind joining the game.

""I'll buy us some time for now. Didn't you say that your wife slept with other men?""

""I'm very sure about it. I ran into her a few times when she was having a meal with different businessmen. From the look in their eyes, I knew there was something going on between them. I wouldn't have married her if I had known she was this kind of woman!""

""Hire a reliable private investigator. It'll be best to have pictures of her having an affair with another man,"" Jasmine stated.

With such evidence, she could negotiate with Diego to reclaim the evidence of Fabian's bribery attempt.

If Diego still refuses to compromise, she'd need to see him in court first for the bribery case.

…

Diego and Jesse were enjoying their time in the bar at night.

A woman in a white strap dress showed up. Her makeup was light, and she let her hair loose. She looked stunning.

The woman walked toward them, and Diego noticed.

""What a coincidence! Are you guys here for a drink, too?""

Although there was an empty seat beside Diego, Jasmine chose to sit next to Jesse.

""You look like a doll today… Are you trying to seduce Mr. Cooper again?""

Jesse grinned.

Jasmine ordered a bottle of whiskey from the barista and filled half of her glass with it.

After taking a sip, she deliberately hung her arm over his shoulders with a smile.

""I think you're hot, too. You're also funny and nice.""

Diego glanced at her and took a sip of his drink.

""Jesse, do you know why callous people can appear flirty?""

He looked serious.

Jasmine almost choked over her drink. He was chiding her once again.

She thought he was a jerk for doing so.

""Because they flirt with different people?""

Jesse was flabbergasted.

""Why the question all of a sudden?""

Sometimes, Jesse swore that he couldn't follow Diego's thoughts.

""That's right. We should never stoop to that level.""

Diego's tone remained serious.

Jasmine felt he was being pretentious.

People might have perceived him as a righteous man, but he was rotten on the inside.

She sighed.

""I guess people can stoop that low sometimes.""

She flashed a smile at him while propping her chin on her hand, and he arched his brow in response.

Jesse choked on his drink and spilled alcohol all over.

Her face flushed red. It seemed like she had lost this time.

Agitated, she kicked his shin with her heels and shoved him away.

Then, she walked over to Diego's seat, bending over to lift his chin and bite his lips.

Her posture exerted dominance. It was as if a lady boss was forcing a kiss on her submissive boyfriend.

His expression darkened. He was about to push her away when she pulled herself from him.

She crossed her arms, satisfied with the mark she left on his lips.

""Mr. Cooper, please lay the evidence on the table before you speak. If you spout nonsense, I will have to—""

Halfway through her declaration, he suddenly stood up and towered over her.

Grabbing her by the waist, Diego pinned her against the counter and bit Jasmine's lips back.

She moaned in pain.

Before Jasmine could hit Diego, he withdrew and placed his hands behind his back.

She massaged her hurting waist and touched her lips, which were bleeding because of his bite.

Her opinion of him being a jerk strengthened.

She was so annoyed that she barked a laugh.

""Diego Cooper, I will make you kneel and beg for mercy one day!""

""Is that so?""

He chuckled.

""I swear to God!"" Jasmine waged a challenge.

He smiled faintly while watching her.

A thrilled Jesse was grinning ear-to-ear.

""Holy moly, you're going to make him kneel and beg for mercy? You have guts, Ms. Black! But… I love it! I'm betting ten thousand dollars!""

He would love to see Diego do that. After all, Diego had always been the epitome of arrogance.

Jesse quickly repeated Jasmine's words in the group chat, which sent everyone wild.

Such bliss should be shared for the greater good.

Everyone in the group chat began placing their bets, and her phone kept ringing from the influx of messages.

She checked the notifications and rolled her eyes at Jesse.

""Wow, thanks.""

""My pleasure. The more, the merrier, right?""

He grinned sheepishly while brushing the tip of his nose.

Jasmine filled her glass and downed it all to regain her composure. Then, she headed to the restroom.

Some suspicious men were following her from behind.

When they reached the corridor to the restroom, someone said to her, ""Jasmine Black from Black, Murphy & Associates?""

She spun around and questioned the six sceptical-looking men, ""Who are you working for?""

""That's none of your business. Anyway, someone wants you crippled to ruin your career,"" said the leading man with red hair.

He brandished the metal bar from his shirt and signaled his men to charge at her. They were all holding the same weapon.

""Fuck. You've just underestimated me there.""

Chapter 5

The six suspicious-looking men had approached her at the right time.

Jasmine coincidentally needed to vent her frustrations.

She warmed up her legs before suddenly kicking the red-haired guy, sending him flying and landing on three other men.

A few minutes later, Diego, who also had to use the restroom, noticed a bunch of guys surrounding Jasmine.

An icy, intimidating air emanated from her.

He joined the fray, easily taking down those men with a few punches and kicks. The blows he dealt were clean-cut.

He might appear to be a level-headed and calm person, but his combat skills were fatal.

""Who are you working for?"" Diego interrogated while stepping on one of the men's faces.

""It's…""

The man had an idea and lied, ""It's Mrs. Cannon from Cannon Group! Ms. Black sent her husband to prison, so she wanted us to teach Ms. Black a lesson.""

""Jesse, call the cops.""

Diego kicked the man and approached Jasmine.

""Are you alright?""

A quick-witted Jasmine clutched her abdomen, feigning pain.

""They hit my stomach with a stick. It hurts…""

Diego wordlessly scooped her up and headed outside. Jasmine was very confused.

She wondered if he was worried about her, even though he said she was heartless and kept angering her.

She considered if he was suffering from dissociative identity disorder.

Jesse called to them, ""Hey! Are you leaving so soon? Why am I cleaning up the mess for you guys again?""

However, the ungrateful duo didn't respond to him.

In the car, Diego asked, ""Do you want to go to the hospital?""

Hugging his neck, Jasmine leaned her head to rest on his shoulder. She stifled the urge to grin while continuing her act.

""It's fine. Do you have medicine at home? You can help me tend to my wounds.""

""I'll send you back to your place then.""

He removed her hands so that she could be seated properly.

""No! I want to go to your place!""

She plastered herself to him, whining.

Diego pushed her away and cupped Jasmine's face.

""You said it was a game. Is my place a playground, then? A place you can come and go whenever you want?""

""I wanna go!""

She slapped off his hand and snorted.

She was going to make this man fall for her one day.

…

The next morning, Jesse returned to Diego's office from the police station.

""Did the cops look into it? Was it Mrs. Cannon?"" inquired Diego.

""Not her, but your client, Daisy Freeman.""

Jesse delved his hands into his pockets, smiling.

Diego's expression darkened.

""If Jasmine finds out it's Daisy behind this, she'll surely sue her. So, I called Jasmine and told her it was Mrs. Cannon's doing.""

Diego didn't respond. Instead, he contacted Daisy to arrange a meeting at his office.

After the call ended, Jesse asked, ""Are you still not going to file a lawsuit against Fabian? No one can ever escape from the charges of bribing a lawyer. Besides, if you file the lawsuit now, you won't have to meet Jasmine in court after that.""

""It's none of your business.""

Diego took a sip of his coffee.

""This is not like you. Have you fallen for her after sleeping with her?"" Jesse teased.

""You must be blind,"" Diego retorted.

""Then, why don't you want to close this divorce case as soon as possible?""

""Can't I toy with her for a while longer? Look how arrogant she is.""

As Jasmine had said, this was simply a game. It wouldn't hurt to play along with her, would it?

""Fine. But do not lose the case because of this game. I've seen how Jasmine defended her client in court several times before. She was sharp, quick-witted, and intimidating. She finished asking her questions before the opposing lawyer could react.""

""Do you think that I'll lose to her?""

Diego cocked his brow.

""What if you're blinded by love?""

…

Daisy intentionally chose a tight black dress with a deep neckline to wear to Cooper, Taylor & Associates.

""Mr. Cooper, why did you call for me?""

Her sexy gait carried her to his table.

She had the nerve to rest her hand on his shoulder before sliding it down to his chest.

Her beauty gave her the confidence to take down any man.

Suddenly, Diego stood up and choked her, dragging her all the way to the floor-to-ceiling window.

He was forced half of her body to hang out of the window.

""First of all, I'll cut your hands off if you touch me again. Secondly, I'll send you straight to prison the next time you hire someone to hurt Jasmine. You won't be able to get a single penny out of your divorce!""

Daisy coughed while trying to pry his hand away.

Looking at his menacing expression was already intimidating enough. When she turned her head to gaze down at the dizzying height, fear gripped her.

They were on the 118th floor.

""I-I won't do it again…""

Only then did he lift her up and throw her to a corner.

""You better see to that.""

The heels Daisy wore were so high that she almost lost her balance and fell.

She clenched her fists and tried to regain her composure.

""Why are you taking her side?""

She couldn't help the question.

Diego wiped his hand, which had touched her, with a few pieces of tissue paper.

He spun around, pinning her with his sharp gaze.

""If my reputation is ruined, will you compensate for it?""

Daisy initially assumed that Diego had feelings for Jasmine. It turned out that he was simply trying to defend his reputation.

""Mr. Cooper, are you confident that we can win this case? I don't want to split my assets into half for that guy without a valid reason.""

Over the last two days, Daisy had looked into Jasmine.

Jasmine accepted various high-profile cases. She was even the defense attorney for a death-row prisoner, who was then released without charges.

Diego may be able to send an innocent person to jail, but Jasmine could get a prisoner off death row.

That was why Daisy was worried about seeing Jasmine in court.

""With me, all I ask is whether you want to win or not because I will certainly win it.""

He spared Daisy a cold glance before returning to his seat.

Daisy didn't say anything further and left.

…

Jasmine and her assistant, Addison, were on their way to the courthouse together.

""Ms. Black, don't you think the plaintiff is pitiful? His daughter needs the money to receive treatment. If he loses the case and is unable to receive insurance for compensation, what's gonna happen to her?"" asked Addison.

As Jasmine crossed her legs, she shifted her attention from the documents in her hands to give him a brief look.

""Having faith in your client and giving them the greatest advantage is the basic principle of a lawyer.""",1,1745375218.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False
1k5odfx,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k5odfx,Ocean Moncton-Halifax,"Nothing much, just sharing from some from traveling on the Ocean.

I took the Ocean from Moncton to Halifax and back this past long weekend. Coming from Montreal the train was delayed in *almost* 4 hours. As it is to be expected nowadays... but of course sucks going to Halifax, almost no restaurants open when arriving at 10 p.m. and it's a very long journey for the workers.

Still, I was in for the ride.

We were in the HEP car (as opposed to the usual REN) and they gave us some free food to make up for the delay. I wish they had done that *before* I ate in the Service car. 🤣️️️️️️ To be honest, from the things I've tried in the Ocean economy, the hot dog is the most edible so far... but I find the coffee always great.

Sorry I only took a few pictures and they are not great, working to improve that.

Pictures:

1. Bedford basin seen from the Service car
2. Free food they offered (a first for me)
3. REN car (honestly dislike those)
4. HEP seat (now we are talking...)
5. Sackville station
6. View after Sackville (with the ""big white box"" in the background - it's a huge cold storage that serves Atlantic CAnada)
7. Train waiting to leave Halifax

Maybe that’s what love is; not the fire, not the chaos, but the tenderness of finally being met. *Of being known without needing to be explained*.

You are not near me, and still, I carry you; in the moments before sleep, in the quiet after the world has gone still, in the songs I skip straight to the chorus, in the coffee that never quite tastes as good without your name in the morning. I have never touched your skin, and still, I swear, my hands remember you.

Isn’t that something? To miss what you’ve never had. To ache for someone like they’ve already lived a hundred lifetimes between galaxies. I look at my reflection and see pieces of you in all the places I’ve softened. And yet, I haven’t traced your fingertips. I haven’t mapped your smile with mine. But I love you, fully. Without waiting for permission. Without needing proof. Without condition. 

People don’t understand how distance can hold something so sacred. But you and I? We existed beyond logic. Beyond explanation. You were not an idea. You were not a maybe. You are here, still, in the shape of every word I haven’t written yet, in the pause between my sentences, in the spaces that no longer feel empty.

I love you, still, in a way that has nothing to do with time. Nothing to do with space. Only everything to do with truth. With energy. With gravity. You pulled at something in me I forgot was alive. And I would wait lifetimes for a touch that feels the way your presence always did.

This is not a beginning. This is not an ending. This is a remembering.

*And God — I remember you everywhere*.

1k5o5hh,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1k5o5hh/3_months_into_being_ditched/,3 months into being ditched,"I spiraled out of nowhere last week. I have made up my mind though! It wasn’t a full relationship, but on and off dates for a couple of months. I thought I had found my person. I rarely ever connect with guys intellectually, and it’s a must for me to be attracted to a guy. Small talk is repulsive for me. He was a handsome devil too. I fell fast and hard. One of those situations where you have a long exciting first date, only to be faced by silence. Men, if you’re not feeling it, do us a favor and make up an excuse after an hour, and leave. Don’t turn a coffee date into a full blown dinner at a nice restaurant and a long walk and talk, and then disappear after the date, and leave us wondering!
Anyway, after a few dates, hours of conversation, and a deep connection I have never felt before, he ended things by text saying he wasn’t feeling it. Before you rant at me “he has the right to not feel…”, you weren’t there at the dates… the hours of conversation, the mutual perspectives, the calm regulation like having known him for years… I don’t get it… and honestly at this point I give up even trying to!!! All of it fits the avoidant, but I don’t care anymore. He did not choose me and that should be my closure. Here’s what I learned though, the minute anyone gives me “I’m not ready”, “I’m not sure”, “it’s not you it’s me”, “I need time”, “let’s see where it goes”, “let’s go with the flow” etc. crap, I’m blocking them from everywhere! Thank you for reading. It gets better I promise! Heal well!! 🥂",1,1745374542.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False
