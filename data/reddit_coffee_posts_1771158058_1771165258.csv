can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

It really is incredible how much your life can change in such a short amount of time.

\* \* \* \* \* \* \*

**November 8th, 2025**

I don’t really know where to start with all of this, so I guess I’ll just start from the very beginning and hope that this somehow makes sense.

My name is Jonathan. I’m 24 years old, which I know isn’t that old to most people, but it sure feels like it sometimes. I was born in 2001 in an unremarkable medium-sized city in the Midwest. Let’s just say this city has seen better days. What was once a major industrial employer has since been turned into a shell of what it used to be. Most of the major companies closed their factories down, and the few that remained open could never get enough workers due to a years-long population decline. The city entered a financial recession, which to this day it hasn’t fully recovered from, despite new attempts at bringing in modernized industry.

Still, a lot of the old-timers who lived to experience this city’s economic boom wanted to keep the glory days alive, I guess. Them, and those who never had a chance in life. I mean, that’s my only explanation as to why those factories stayed open: clinging on to relics of the past. One of those people was my own father. He was, let’s just say, most people’s idea of what a stereotypical blue-collar worker was. One of those pickup-truck-driving, beer-drinking types who didn’t believe in higher education, claiming that you had to get your hands dirty to be a “real man” and that college was just a scam.

Right off the bat, our relationship was less than ideal. Trust me, you did not want to ever get on his bad side, or else all hell would break loose. I’m sure the death of my mother didn’t do any good for his mental state. That’s why, despite his anger problems, he got full custody of me right from the start. Looking back, I’m pretty sure he was severely depressed on top of it all. I mean, how could he not be? Slaving away at the same factory your whole life, watching any opportunity you had to make something of your life slowly slip away. Even from a young age, I knew that I didn’t want that kind of life.

The problem was that I never really knew what I actually did want. As a kid, I felt completely aimless. I was quiet, shy, the kind of kid everyone else pays extra attention to. This made me a prime target for bullies, who would physically and emotionally torment me every chance they got. I honestly just accepted it. I knew I wasn’t normal. I was a weird kid with no mother and a father who I was honestly afraid of most of the time.

Most days when I got home from school, I’d find my father sitting on the couch in the living room in front of the TV, watching either news reports or some college football game, exhausted from having worked all day. I never said much to him, and he never said much in return. I would spend the rest of the day in my cramped bedroom, either doing homework or escaping into one of my video games, the colourful images and cute characters distracting me from the torment I faced in the real world. When bedtime came around, I’d just lie awake staring out the small window next to my bed at the decrepit old houses out on the cracked street in front of our place, hoping that I would find any sort of direction someday.

Things continued like this for a long time. My father never gave up his tough-guy attitude, and I kept on being the social outcast at school. Honestly, I don’t remember much from that period of my life. What I do remember, though, is the day I thought everything was going to change. It was March 21st, 2016. I was a freshman in high school, still 14 at the time, and it had just been another run-of-the-mill day for me. At 1 p.m., a dozen other kids and I settled into our science class. Our teacher told us that we’d be starting on the biology unit that day and put on a nature documentary for us to watch.

Seriously, I still remember this moment like it was yesterday. The documentary opened on the most beautiful-looking scenery I had ever seen. Deep blue skies and lush green forest as far as you could see, broken up by majestic-looking mountains in the background. The narrator of the documentary stated that we were currently looking at the Olympic Peninsula in Washington. I was entranced by the beauty I was seeing. The scene then switched to a shot of a cat moving slowly through the forest below. The narrator described the scene: a female cougar stalking a lonesome deer, looking for her next meal.

The cougar moved so quietly, barely making a sound as she prepared herself for the kill, and I’ll admit I was silently cheering her on. Suddenly, it jumped up, and the deer had no time to react before it was quickly taken down and suffocated by the large cat. I watched in complete awe as the cougar proceeded to drag the dead deer a short distance to a small area of densely packed trees.

What happened next is the part I remember the most about it all. The cougar let go of the deer and turned her head towards a small bush a few feet away. She meowed quietly, and out from behind the bush emerged several kittens — her babies. The mother cougar returned to the deer carcass, and her cubs ran after her, bouncing along the soft ground and over the exposed tree roots lining the forest floor. I vividly remember feeling my eyes go wide as I watched the kittens bumping into each other as they bounded towards their food, innocent as anything. It took everything in me not to scream. It was the cutest thing I’d ever seen.

I don’t really remember what happened after that; it all felt like a blur to me. I had so many emotions running through my mind, all from a simple documentary, but something changed in me that day. Seeing those kittens ignited something in me, and for the first time in my life, I no longer felt aimless. To this day, I’m amazed at how quickly all of this happened, but I finally knew what I wanted to do with my life. After so many years of wandering aimlessly, I finally had an answer. I wanted to work with animals. I wanted to live in the Pacific Northwest, far away from the industrial wasteland that I was so familiar with. I had finally found my calling, and by God, I was going to do whatever I could to make my new dream a reality.

For the next few months, I was on top of the world. Every night, I’d spend my time researching various canine and feline species, learning as much as I could about them. I’d get lost in nature documentaries and dream about living in the locations they visited. I began researching different schools, taking a liking to one in particular purely based on its proximity to the landscape I was so in love with. I even found myself browsing used cars and trucks online. From Lincoln Town Cars to beat-up GMC trucks, I began imagining myself taking an epic cross-country road trip to college in one of them, exploring the country and never coming back to this place. It was genuinely the best time of my life. I was still bullied at school, but I didn’t care. My relationship with my father was still shaky, but I didn’t care. I finally knew what it was like to have a dream.

I guess what they say is true — good times have to end at some point. I’d never told my father about my plan, as I was terrified of what his reaction would be, but something in me finally convinced me to go through with it. I honestly don’t know what I expected to happen, but I never expected it to go the way it did. On August 2nd, after months of building up the courage to talk to my father, I finally told him about everything. I said that I loved science, I loved animals, and that I wanted to go to college to become a biologist. I even told him I’d take out loans to help pay for it so he wouldn’t have to get stressed over the financial side of it all.

Let me tell you, I’d seen the man blow his top before, but I was not prepared for the reaction I got this time. He grabbed me by the wrist and dragged me through the house and into the garage. I tried to protest, but he never let up on me. We entered the garage, and he grabbed a short but sturdy piece of wood off his workbench. He held me against the workbench as he began hitting me in the shoulders with it. I begged him to stop, but he wouldn’t listen. He shouted at me that I was a fool for getting involved in such nonsense and that at some point I had to learn the value of “honest work” if I ever wanted to be a “real adult.” After what felt like an eternity of tirades, he threw the piece of wood at the wall and stormed back inside the house, slamming the door behind him and leaving me shaking and unable to process anything that had just happened. I remember quietly going back inside the house and shutting myself inside my bedroom, collapsing on my bed and silently crying my eyes out for at least an hour.

Well, if that man’s goal was to instill so much fear in me that I’d never dare have dreams like that ever again, then it really worked. Suddenly, the thought of pursuing a degree in biology was no longer something to keep me going. It was no longer a beacon of light at the end of the dark tunnel I found myself in, metaphorically speaking. Instead, it served as a reminder of what had happened that day.

Not wanting to be reminded of that day, I completely shut down again. The one dream I ever had, completely destroyed. Once again, I found myself wandering aimlessly through life, sometimes wondering what I did to deserve the hand I’d been dealt. I went from pushing myself in class to doing the absolute bare minimum to pass.

On my 16th birthday, my father sat me down to talk to me. He said that I was now “officially an adult” and that it wasn’t his job to take care of me anymore. He told me I had until I turned 18 to “keep freeloading off of him,” and then I’d be out of the house. I wish I could tell you that I was devastated by this news, that I felt my world shatter around me, but to be honest, I didn’t care. I was on complete autopilot at that point, only focused on making it to the next day.

I didn’t dare object to him this time. I immediately began setting myself up for what was coming. I got my driver’s licence later that year and even found myself a part-time job at a fast-food place at a truck stop just outside of the city. My father agreed to drive me, but only until I saved up enough to buy my own car.

I’ll say it straight up: the job sucked. On my first day, I was assigned to the fry station. Having to stand in front of a hot fryer for hours was unbearable, and most of my coworkers were less than friendly. It seemed like most of them were there because they never had the chance at anything more, and all their anger and bitterness seemed to come out on me most days. I remember one of my coworkers, an elderly woman named Barbara, would go ballistic on me every time I made even the slightest mistake or didn’t move fast enough.

The nicer folks were around my age, just there to pick up some extra cash. It probably helped them knowing that one day they’d be off to better things and that this was only temporary for them, and I’ll admit I found myself jealous of them because of that.

In my senior year of high school, I’d finally saved enough money to buy a car. I wasn’t looking for anything particular, just something cheap and reliable to get me to work and back. I settled on a 2002 Honda CR-V that I still have to this day. It had seen better days. It was covered in dents and scratches, and the interior was torn up pretty badly as well, but it was cheap, and the monthly insurance payments wouldn’t break my bank account, and by that point, it was all I cared about.

I don’t know how, but through all of this, I kept my grades above passing. My dreams of college were nothing but a distant relic at this point, but school still meant something to me, I guess. I honestly don’t know why; I mean, it’s not like I saw any point in any of that stuff anymore. Some voice inside of me, barely audible, just told me to keep at it. Still, on graduation day, I felt no pride, no happiness. While everyone else was looking forward to whatever future they had planned, all I had to look forward to was getting the boot from my father.

The past six years went by a lot quicker than I thought they would. I guess once you start living day by day, your perception of time gets distorted. Six years ago, I packed what I could fit into the CR-V and drove away from my father’s place for the last time while he stared at me from the front porch, not even bothering to say goodbye.

I had spent that summer setting myself up with an apartment in the city. It was cheap, but the saying “you get what you pay for” is definitely accurate, especially when it comes to housing. The building was located on the rougher side of town, in one of the main industrial areas. The area wasn’t exactly well-off, and every morning, I’d see another car in the parking lot with its windows smashed in. For once, I was thankful that my car was in the condition it was. They probably didn’t see any reason to go through a car that looked like mine.

After a while, I got used to the smell of the pollution and the constant blaring of police sirens. I kept working at the fast-food place, but after a while, I knew I wasn’t going to be able to afford to keep living off a few part-time shifts a week. Since I was denied a full-time position, I had no choice but to begin looking for another job.

I wouldn’t really say that I got lucky. I mean, with everything that had led me to this point in my life, luck seemed like a completely foreign concept to me. One day, as I was driving back to the apartment after a particularly busy day at work, I noticed one of the factories a few blocks from the apartment was looking for full-time general labourers. By this point, my bank account was already near exhaustion, and since it wasn’t where my father worked, I bit the bullet and applied online later that evening. I was surprised at how quickly I got a job offer. The fast-food place seemed eager to get rid of me, and before I knew it, I was officially an employee of the factory, where I still work to this day.

On my first day one of the plant supervisors took me to the place where trucks were loaded and unloaded, where a small group of people were busy taking boxes out of one of the trailers. He told me that my job would involve working with these people to load and unload each truck that came.

On my first day, one of the plant supervisors took me to the place where trucks were loaded and unloaded, where a small group of people were busy taking boxes out of one of the trailers. He told me that my job would involve working with these people to load and unload each truck that came.

Good lord, I thought working the fryer was backbreaking and mind-numbing work. After something like three days of working at this place, I had already checked out. For eight hours a day, all I did was pick up boxes from the trucks and carry them over to where forklifts would pick them up later. Sometimes the forklifts would bring us pallets stacked with boxes, which we would then carry into the trucks.

My coworkers honestly made me nervous. I heard everything from prison stories to the most ridiculous conspiracy theories imaginable, all day, every day. They constantly insulted me for my lack of physical strength or desire to be a “real man” like they were. Through it all, I just kept my head down and did my best to get to the end of each shift.

Every single night, I would get back to the apartment exhausted to the point of not wanting to do anything. I’d have dinner, watch some videos on YouTube, and fall asleep. Rinse and repeat. Every single day for what actually felt like forever.

I was surprised that there didn’t seem to be much turnover of employees at this place. I guess those guys needed that work as much as I did. Despite getting used to seeing the same folks every day, I never made any effort to try and talk to them. One day, that changed, however. During one of my breaks, I sat down at an empty table across from an elderly man eating a sandwich.

I think it was the fact that I didn’t look or behave like the others that made him do a double take at me. He asked me why someone my age would choose to work in a place like that instead of joining the other young folks who were hitting the highway, looking for opportunity elsewhere. I didn’t say much in return, just that I needed some quick cash. Looking back, I realize I was probably doing a horrible job at pretending that nothing was wrong, but he didn’t press me anymore that day, and I was happy to be left alone.

This guy seemed like he was interested in getting to know me, so he began talking with me more often during breaks, despite my initial disinterest. His name was Ellis, and he’d been working in that factory since 1966. I’ll admit I was a little taken aback when he told me this. He seemed intelligent and well-spoken, not like a lot of the other guys who worked there. I gathered the courage to say more than two words to him for once and asked him how he ended up in this kind of life.

Turns out, we weren’t so different from each other, and for the first time in a long time, I actually felt emotional when Ellis told me about his youth, as it kind of reminded me of my own. He was nine years old when Sputnik launched, igniting his passion for outer space. He worked hard in school to get accepted into college to study astronomy and was apparently all set to go — that is, until his father was killed in an industrial accident. His mother completely broke down after this happened, to the point that she couldn’t even take care of herself anymore.

Ellis, not wanting to just abandon his mother while she was going through all of this, officially shelved his lifelong dream and took a job at this very factory to make ends meet and provide for his mother. For over 40 years, he slaved away at the place, something I had a hard time comprehending. By the time she passed away, Ellis was in his mid-50s, his dreams a distant relic by this point, and he kept his job at the factory to keep getting by.

Hearing all of this made me more comfortable opening up about my own experiences. I told Ellis about how I had dreamed of moving to the Pacific Northwest and going to college and how my father wouldn’t accept it and eventually kicked me out of the house, leading me to take any kind of job I could to get by.

Despite being 53 years older than me, Ellis was honestly the closest I ever had to a friend. I could tell he enjoyed having someone to talk to for once, and I felt the same towards him. Sure, the job never got any better, but the conversations we’d have made the days go by a little faster, and over the years, we grew surprisingly close. He would always tell me that, unlike him, I still had the chance to chase my dreams if I really wanted to and that I’d absolutely regret not doing so. I appreciated that he was trying to help me, but my own fate felt sealed at this point.

It was earlier this year, in March, that everything began to change. The 17th had started out uneventful enough, but then something struck me as odd. I noticed that Ellis hadn’t shown up for work. Ellis had almost never missed a single day of work in all the years I’d been there, but I wasn’t too worried at the time. Maybe he’d just gotten sick and needed a day or two to recover. As the week went on, however, I began to get a little worried. Where was he? It wasn’t until the 21st that I overheard a conversation between a few workers as I was clocking out for the day.

Apparently, Ellis had been out for a drive the previous Sunday, and a drunk driver left their lane and smashed into his car head-on. Both the driver and Ellis were killed on impact. I wish I could tell you I felt sad, but to be completely honest, I couldn’t find it in me to feel much of anything. Way deep down, I felt horrible for that. The only person in my life who ever cared about me was dead, and I couldn’t even be a little bit sad about it.

I just kept working and getting by. Slow as molasses in January is how I’d describe the past few months. I managed, but to be honest, every day seemed to drag on forever without the old man to brighten them up just that much. Imagine spending your whole life working a dead-end job in some run-down factory, never being able to follow your dreams and live your life, only to be killed by someone else’s actions well into what should’ve been his retirement years.

I began thinking back to what he always told me. “Chase your dreams while you still have time.” Despite his death, I still had a hard time thinking seriously about Ellis’ words. By this point, I’d honestly just grown comfortable with my life. I had a routine, and while it certainly wasn’t the life I ever thought I’d have, or wanted to have, it was familiar, and it got me by, which is all I cared about anymore.

Sorry, I know that took a while to go through. I just wanted to give you some context for what led to today’s experience. I’ll also be directly quoting the conversations I had, so apologies if this next part sounds a little weird.

I can’t say anything felt unusual when I woke up, other than the pounding headache I had from the grey, overcast weather. I thought I would be able to silence the headache with a nice cup of coffee, but of course my old coffee maker decided that today would be the day it would stop working. I made my usual breakfast, two scrambled eggs and some bacon, which I ate while staring across the dark, cramped apartment towards the balcony, barely being able to see the other buildings outside due to the fog. The old beat-up CRV reminded me to get it serviced with that piercing orange light, but it still got me to work on time.

I made my way into the factory with the usual crowd, my headache only subsiding slightly as I clocked in. Despite this, I felt a little weird. I couldn’t tell why I felt this way or what caused the feeling in the first place, but something felt off, as if the air in the building was thicker. I just pushed these thoughts aside and got to work. Box after box, I loaded up each truck, listening to my coworkers talking about the latest political drama and conspiracies. As always, I ignored them and did what I was paid to do. Despite being just another normal morning, I still couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong. I chalked it up to my headache making my mind play tricks on me.

After what felt like an eternity, the sweet sound of the lunch bell echoed throughout the factory, and I sluggishly made my way to the breakroom, a chance to put down this headache with some caffeine. The breakroom looked as it always had, the dull grey ceiling lights illuminating the faded white walls and tan-coloured tile floor. Of course, the ancient coffee maker was out of order. I silently cursed the universe for having it out for me on this particular morning.

The breakroom was never usually too crowded, as most of the workers would instead eat lunch outside and smoke. Today, however, the room was a lot more crowded than it usually was, no doubt because of the weather. Though I recognized some of them, I’d never spoken to them before. I sat down in a relatively private area in the back corner of the room. By this point, my headache was so bad I could barely see straight or form a coherent thought. I laid my head down in my arms on the table and closed my eyes, hoping I could relax enough to alleviate the pain.

I don’t know exactly when I dozed off, but I remember opening my eyes feeling slightly groggy. I lifted my head and looked around the breakroom, which was completely void of any signs of life. I cursed myself for falling asleep, not having had any lunch, and now being late getting back to work. I tried to check the time on my phone, but it wouldn’t turn on. I’d remembered to charge it the previous night and chalked it up to being an old model.

I left my lunchbox on the table, reminding myself to pick it up at the end of my shift, and quickly left the room to get back to work before anyone noticed I was missing. As I walked down the dimly lit hall back to the factory floor, however, I could tell something wasn’t right. There was no sign of life anywhere. No one was in the hall, and the surrounding rooms were completely empty. It was also unusually quiet. I couldn’t hear the familiar sounds of the machinery or the rumbling of the forklifts’ engines. It was at this point I noticed that my headache had completely disappeared, which I was silently grateful for. I tried not to think about the lack of activity and kept walking.

When I got back to the factory floor, I was in complete shock at what I discovered. The entire factory was completely empty. The machinery had been completely shut down. The doors by the loading bay had all been closed, and forklifts were strewn about all over the place. I just stopped and stared at it all. I looked up to the windows near the ceiling of the loading bay, and outside the sky was pitch black. The possibility that I had slept uninterrupted until nightfall seemed completely crazy.

I ran back to the breakroom and grabbed my lunchbox, then hurried to the factory’s main exit. I tried the door, but it wouldn’t budge. At this point, I began sweating, trying to figure out what the hell was going on. It was then that I noticed something. I guess I was in such a panic that I completely brushed over it. I looked through the small window on the door, and I couldn’t see anything. No lights, no buildings, no cars, literally nothing at all. It was like staring into a black hole. Just a completely black void.

By this point, I was in a full-on panic. I ran to different exits, trying each of them with no success. Hell, I even tried the doors in the loading bay. Again, they wouldn’t budge. I tried calming myself down, telling myself that I’d just fallen asleep and it was all just a bad dream. Still, something in me told me that wasn’t the case. It felt too real, too vivid to be a dream.

I began pacing back and forth, scratching at my skin and hitting myself in the head, trying anything to see if I could wake up from whatever nightmare I was in. It was then that I heard something. The faint sound of footsteps coming from one of the aisles beyond the loading bay. I froze. Honestly, I couldn’t figure out if I should’ve been relieved or afraid that I wasn’t alone in there.

I peered into the aisle where I heard the noise coming from, and I saw a person about halfway down the aisle with their back to me. I was terrified, but I felt like I had no other choice. I slowly began making my way toward them, feeling myself shaking with each step. A few times, I nearly lost my balance and fell over.

When I was maybe twenty feet from the person, I called out to them, my voice trembling so much I was surprised I was able to speak at all.

“H-hello…?” I called out. My heart felt like it was going to explode. The person turned around to look at me, and when they did, I immediately felt cold sweat all over my body. I don’t remember even blinking as I just stared at them. They looked normal, but I was immediately drawn to their eyes, which were pitch-black orbs as dark as the outside. They began walking towards me slowly. I couldn’t move, not only because of the immense fear I felt, but also because I knew exactly who they were.

“...E-Ellis…?” I sputtered. He stopped about five feet from me, and a smile formed on his face.

“Jonathan,” he said, his voice sounding all too familiar. “You made it.” I didn’t move, still trying to figure out exactly what was going on. I tried to speak again.

“W-w-what… w-what is…” I stopped. Like, I couldn’t form thoughts at that moment. My mind was literally blank.

“Don’t worry, kid,” Ellis said. “You’ll be alright. Just don’t go fainting on me, okay?” I’ll admit, hearing his voice again, combined with his usual warm demeanour, somehow calmed me down a little, though I was still thoroughly freaked out over the whole situation. “Come on, let’s sit down. There’s something I want to tell you.”

I hesitantly followed him back to the breakroom, resisting every urge and thought screaming at me to make a run for it. I sat down next to my lunchbox, and Ellis sat down across from me. I couldn’t make eye contact. I mean, how do you make eye contact with someone, or something, that has no eyes? I was still shaking and stuttering like a maniac, but somehow my thoughts came back to me, and I was able to form coherent sentences again.

“W-what the hell is going on?” I stammered through heavy breathing. “What… is this place? Why… w-why am I h-here?” Ellis reached over to me and put his hand on my shoulder. I flinched hard, but something—I don’t know what—finally gave me the courage to look at his face again. I cringed seeing his eyes again, but I also saw that same warm smile, that same smile that told me he cared when no one else did. He patted me on the shoulder a few times, and somehow I began to calm down.

Ellis sat back down in his chair, and I took a moment to breathe. I gathered my thoughts and spoke.

“What the hell is this place?” I asked hesitantly. “Why are you here? Why am I here?”

“Jonathan,” Ellis replied to me with a slight hint of concern in his voice. “There’s something I need to tell you, and you have to listen to me, alright? Don’t ignore me this time, okay?” As he said this, I felt a tinge of guilt creep into my mind, and I had a pretty good idea of what he was going to start talking about. I took a few more breaths, then replied.

“A-alright,” I said.

“So you may have heard about my untimely demise,” said Ellis.

“Y-yeah, I d-did,” I replied. “Y-you were k-killed by a drunk driver, r-right?”

“Damn truck hit me head-on,” Ellis said back, his tone of concern being replaced with mild anger. “Crazy fool must’ve been going aroundahundred miles per hour. Had literally no time to react.”

“J-jesus,” I said, not wanting to even imagine the situation at this point. Ellis continued.

“I only remember a split second of the impact. Next thing I knew, I woke up here. I tried to escape, but just as you did, I found every exit sealed shut. Tried near everything to get out of this place.”

“So…” I said, looking around the confines of the breakroom, “you’ve been trapped in here ever since?” Ellis looked around and sighed.

“Yep,” he replied, sounding defeated. “Sure is lonely here. Wandering the same aisles and rooms aimlessly, over and over again, with not a single soul to talk to.” He looked me in the eyes, at least I think, and continued to talk. “I think I know what happened, and you have to listen to what I’m about to tell you.” At this point, I was immensely curious as to what. I did my best to make eye contact.

“So… what’s going on?” I asked nervously, my voice still trembling slightly. I wasn’t actually sure if I wanted to know, but by now my curiosity was pulling at me for answers, so I went through with it—but what he said next are words that will stick with me until the day I die.

“Kid,” Ellis said as he looked around the breakroom once more, then back to me, his voice laced with sadness. “I think… I think this is my afterlife.” I couldn’t say anything. I was so confused about it all. I tried to talk, but my throat felt frozen in place.

“The universe works in mysterious ways, doesn’t it?” Ellis asked rhetorically. “Seems like since I dedicated my whole life to this place, it decided that I’d stay here forever. Thought I’d finally find peace when I died, but it seems that the universe has a sick sense of humor.”

I stared at Ellis as he stood up from his seat. He walked around to my side of the table and sat down right next to me. I looked him directly in the eye, as much as I could.

“Jonathan,” he began, “I need to ask you something important.” I listened intently as he continued. “You’ve got one life in front of you. Is this really how you want to spend it?”

I looked at the floor, and a strange feeling washed over me. I felt sad. It had been so long since I last allowed myself to feel such emotion that it felt almost alien to me. Every event, every conversation that led me to this point in my life came rushing back to me all at once. The isolation I experienced as a kid. The day my world changed and I had a dream for the first time in my life. The day my father literally beat my dream out of me, which also started my downward spiral, eventually landing me right here in this breakroom.

After suppressing these feelings for so long and believing it was too late for myself to reignite my childhood passion, it felt weird to have them come back like this. I felt something in my eyes. Tears. I guess Ellis noticed too.

“You’re twenty-four, Jon,” he said. “Is this truly what you want to make of your life?” I tried to hide my crying, but the feelings of regret were just too strong. I put my hands over my face, and for the second time in my life, began bawling my eyes out like there was no tomorrow. It truly wasn’t what I wanted, and I couldn’t pretend like it didn’t bother me anymore.

Suddenly, Ellis grabbed me, and I instinctively put my arms around him as he wrapped me in the biggest hug I’d ever felt. I was wailing.

“This isn’t what I wanted at all,” I sobbed as I held an iron grip on Ellis. “But I feel like it’s too late already.”

“Jon, Jon,” Ellis replied.

“I’m sorry,” I said, still crying.

“Hey, hey, it’s okay, it’s okay,” he reassured as he continued to hug me.

I don’t know how long I cried for; honestly, to me it felt like an hour. As I began to calm down, I gently pushed myself off of Ellis, who let me go. I sat back down in my chair and looked at the floor once again.

“Jonathan, listen to me,” Ellis said. I looked up at him as I wiped the tears from my eyes. “You’re twenty-four years old. You still have your entire life in front of you. It’s too late for me, because, well, I’m already dead. But it’s not too late for you. You have so many years ahead of you.”

“I-I guess,” I said, still sniffling. “It’s just been so long. I don’t know if I could do it at this point. It’s been so long.” Ellis sighed, then looked around the breakroom before turning to look at me.

“Felt damn good to talk to you again,” he said warmly, “but I’m afraid I’ve got to send you back to the real world before it’s too late.” I looked at Ellis, not saying anything, as he continued. “Whatever you choose to take away from our conversation today is none of my business, but I’m gonna ask you one more time. Do you really want to spend your only shot, your one chance, endlessly slaving away at this place?” I just sat there, taking everything in, trying to think of anything to say. After an admittedly awkward silence, I spoke.

“I-I’ll think about it, I guess.” Ellis smiled as he patted me on the shoulder.

Next thing I knew, I was jolted awake by the sound of the familiar wail of the buzzer as it echoed throughout the factory. Five minutes to get back to the loading bay. Whatever that was felt like it lasted a lot longer than thirty minutes. I looked around the breakroom. The few people who were in there with me put their lunch boxes away and left the room, one of them impatiently telling me to stop slacking and get back to work before they disappeared. I just sat there, trying to comprehend what had just happened. I got through the rest of the day somehow, with the whole experience basically playing on repeat in my mind the whole time.

When I got back to the apartment about an hour ago, my mind was reeling. I wanted to believe that whatever I’d experienced had just been a really vivid dream, yet something deep inside me was telling me that it wasn’t that simple. The whole experience felt so real, and I’d felt completely awake the whole time.

After spending a few minutes watching the evening set over the city and taking a few moments to collect my thoughts, I lay down in my bed with my laptop, which is where I am right now. Seriously, that university still looks as beautiful as when I first discovered it way back then. Somehow my grades from high school remained good enough that they met the requirements for applying to their biology program—don’t ask me how. I’m hoping the job will pay well enough in the next eight months that I won’t have to apply for loans, but honestly, that’s not even a big concern of mine at this point.

I think I’ll wrap this up now and see about getting to work on my application. I still have a few weeks before the deadline, so if I start now, I should be finished well before then. Again, I’m sorry if this whole thing has come off as a mess and a bit weird, but I just have so many questions. Had I had the most vivid dream of my life? Or did Ellis, by some freak occurrence in the universe, actually bring me into his afterlife?

I guess I’ll never know for sure. I doubt anyone would even believe me if I told them about it. But if by any chance, no matter how slim, I actually did witness Ellis’ afterlife, then let me tell you, I don’t know what I’d do if I ended up like that. Eternally walking the halls of a place I never wanted to be in the first place, all the time in the world to think about what could’ve been.

I’ll end this here. I’m nervous—like, really nervous—right now. I don’t know if this will work. My application could be rejected. I could go into a ton of debt from how much this will cost me that’ll take me years to repay. The CR-V could break down and leave me stranded on some desolate part of Interstate 90. Hell, maybe this won’t even lead to anything. After all, I’ve heard that biology is a competitive field right now, but I feel like I have to at least give it a shot. I have to at least try. Try to get back the life I thought I’d lost so long ago now. I have to try while I still have time. I have to try before it’s too late. I have to try before I end up walking that empty factory floor for eternity, just like Ellis.",1,1771164981.0,stories,0,1.0,False

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

I've tried baking this raspberry lemon coffee cake and this came out.

I tried not to overmix anything, as instructed, and baked for 1h first at 175°C (recipe says between 45/55min). I did use frozen raspberries, and was still very wet before, hence why I baked for around an hour.

This came out. After cooling down and opening, I saw it and tried popping it in the oven a bit longer, controlling it every 10min, but nothing changed.

I did change the recipe for a smaller pan (x0.8), and the only thing I didn't reduce was the eggs, because that wasn't easily feasible.

it doesn't taste bad, but I'm afraid it's not healthy to eat. I did have some last night and nothing happened to me haha. It tasted good - someone else tried and it was good, didn't feel super doughy or heavy the centre.

Also, I used olive oil for the vegetable oil - didn't have anything else in hand or in the closest supermarket. Could it have been that?  I thought it was okay but maybe not :(

High-resolution, photorealistic vertical smartphone-style portrait of a young female subject seated inside a vehicle. The image captures a medium close-up shot from the chest upward, centering on the subject’s face and upper torso. The lighting is natural, diffused daylight entering from the left side, creating soft highlights on the right side of the subject's face (viewer's left) and casting gentle shadows on the opposite side, emphasizing facial contours.

The subject has a tanned, smooth complexion with a warm undertone. Her face is oval-shaped with high cheekbones and a defined jawline. She has long, straight, platinum blonde hair styled with a center part; visible dark roots transition into the bleached lengths, which fall flat and smooth over her shoulders and back. Her eyebrows are groomed, arched, and darkened to a soft brown shade. Her eyes are light blue-grey, framed by prominent, dark eyelashes and subtle eyeliner. Her nose is straight and narrow. Her lips are full and plump, coated in a glossy, light pink nude lipstick that reflects the ambient light. The facial expression is relaxed with the corners of the mouth slightly upturned and lips closed. The head is tilted very slightly to the subject's right.

She wears a tight-fitting, sleeveless top in a muted taupe or grey color. The fabric features a fine vertical ribbed texture. The neckline is a deep, wide scoop cut that sits low on the chest, revealing the upper slope of the bust and cleavage, fitting snugly against the torso. Around her neck, she wears a thick, chunky gold chain necklace in a Cuban link style, resting on her collarbones.

Her right arm is bent at the elbow, raising a clear plastic iced coffee cup to chest height on the left side of the frame. Her hand grips the cup near the top rim; her fingers are manicured with long, almond-shaped nails painted in a sheer nude or French tip style. The cup contains a light brown iced coffee beverage with visible ice cubes and features the circular green and white Starbucks siren logo clearly printed on the side. A green plastic straw protrudes from the lid.

The background consists of the interior of a luxury car. Behind the subject, a beige leather car seat with a headrest is visible. To the left, a car window shows a blurred outdoor scene with hints of greenery, a pole, and a bright sky, indicating daytime. The interior roof of the car is a light beige fabric. The depth of field is shallow enough to keep the focus sharply on the subject while slightly softening the car interior details behind her. The overall color palette is dominated by warm tans, beiges, the cool platinum of the hair, the grey of the top, and the accent green of the straw and logo.

1r5fdtw,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r5fdtw,"The Symphonium Giant: a Giant in price, Lilliput in quality","Symphonium Audio is a recent yet powerful entrant into the world of audio, with their in-ear monitors (IEMs) and cables, and two of their offerings are into my personal list of the best I have heard, the Meteor and the Titan and now I have in my hands, their middle order between the aforementioned in the Giant, which doesn’t live up to its name. I received this unit from [Meesh](https://www.head-fi.org/members/meeshnomore.608194/) who, in collaboration with [Rishabh Negi](https://x.com/YourbroRishabh) sent me this unit, and I am supremely thankful to them.

Symphonium kept the packaging minimal and straight to the point- it advertises the tech involved in the Giant which the bigger sibling in the Titan also has, Phase Harmony Attenuation Technology or PHAT. Sliding the cover out and lifting the Symphonium Audio branded lid, I found a nice card with an etched metal plate with the name of the IEM written along with its serial number. Past that, I found a small carry case that reminded me of the Crinear Daybreak, there’s company branding again and I found the IEMs inside the protective pouch along with the cable. There’s a box labelled Giant, where I found an IEM cleaning tool, a jar of silica gel and various eartips.

I shouldn’t be voicing my displeasure but I have to say this, but these eartips have had some of the worst designing going on as the Giant has a rather large nozzle and these eartips have some of the smallest bores where I spent a good 10-15 minutes trying on the blue bore eartips specially and it was mostly the same with the other eartips I got. 

Stock cable is modular and feels nice in hand, I like this stock cable more than the one that comes with the Titan and comfort is typical Symphonium: small shape and despite the large nozzle, it fit me very well and I had no problems wearing the IEM for extended periods, and there was no pressure buildup.

Enough talk, here’s the sound.  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Lows**

The Symphonium Giant, compared to its other offerings both below and above its retail price, performs in a rather underwhelming manner: the delivery is poorly executed, the proportions bleed into the midrange and it just comes off muffled and too much in quantity as the quality is simply not there, and it feels veiled.

In tracks like Daft Punk’s *Instant Crush* and *Get Lucky*, the Giant simply has the details blurred; I simply couldn't enjoy the otherwise clean and powerful bass lines that both tracks have. And the way the bass overall feels like a congested burp rather than a clean, healthy dollop. And since it sounds muffled while spilling into the midrange, tonality is adversely affected and vocals, as a result, sound thin. This slightly improves when I listen to tracks like Avicii’s Levels, but even in that track, the Giant didn't impress me.

Situation for the Giant further worsens when I switch to tracks like Rush’s *Limelight*, where the granular details on the bass line are fully smudged over to deliver the quantity and ends up ruining the whole sound. Kick drums sound too punchy and lack refinement, and the way it extends — it's delayed and worsens the whole sound further. This also leads to vocals sounding too thin and strained because the bass keeps ‌intruding. The worst part is, towards the end of the track when Neil Peart concludes it with a roll, the bass feels so much so that I had to grip the cartilage of my nose as it was nauseating.

**Mids**

The Giant continues to disappoint me through the midrange by having the whole sound come off congested, strained in parts while delivering a wide stage, which again defeats the entire purpose of having a wide stage. What good is a healthy stage if the IEM cannot do details, instrument separation or tonality the way it should?

In tracks like Animals as Leaders’ *The Woven Web* and Periphery’s *Marigold*, the Giant once again smudges the details that the guitars and cymbals should have. Tonality takes a hit as it cannot decide how it wants to sound, and I really had a hard time penning my thoughts here. Timbre, especially in toms and snares, felt very off — neither consistently natural nor consistently metallic; just simply off.

It is the same when I listen to tracks like Tool’s *Pneuma* and The Police’s *Message in a Bottle* where only the relatively wide stage is the only saving grace. Imaging worsens as these tracks have a lot of instrumental work going on; guitars once again sound unnatural and blurred, vocals feel strained and a bit too laid back for my preference, and that's mostly just about it.

**Highs**

The Giant has its poorest showing here, where I had my hardest time keeping a level head and noting down its performance where I just wanted to take this IEM off my ears and listen to something else because it's just poor.

In tracks like Adele’s *Easy On Me*, the piano maintains a recovery curve in tonality which gets destroyed the moment the vocals kick in: undesirably weighted, thick and completely off in tonality. I just couldn't enjoy this song and especially when the climax of the track comes in where the Giant suddenly sounds fatiguing while losing weight; and I don't want to elaborate further, it was simply just a horrible listen.

In tracks like Kendrick Lamar's *Alright*; I slightly enjoyed listening to it as the Giant offers the punch that this track has but again, the vocals overall felt lethargic and the background hums felt slightly out of place as the Giant prioritized having the horns take center stage. I perceived the cymbals to have a subtle, minute sibilance and, yes, that's about it.  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

***Comparisons:***

* **Versus the Symphonium Meteor:** this will be short. The Meteor, despite being more affordable in price, outperforms the Giant by a considerable margin. Lows are clearly more pronounced, have better detail; vocals have a healthy amount of weight, timbre is minutely better comparatively, and there's no fatigue. Not to mention, putting eartips on the Meteor is much easier.
* **Versus the Symphonium Titan:** no contest. The price bump in the Titan proves its worth and lays the definition of what “visceral bass” means. Feed the Titan to a good source and just simply enjoy the thunderous, detailed sub-bass that the Titan has. The stage does take a hit, but details, instrument separation, and timbre on the Titan are miles better than the Giant. Again, to summarize, Titan simply is the much better IEM.
* **Versus the Punch Audio Martilo**: this convincingly worsens all arguments for the Giant, as a similar delivery but with more detail and a better, controlled punch in the Martilo puts a big fat question mark on the Giant’s asking price. The only argument Giant has against the Martilo is a much smaller fit, resulting in better comfort and little to no pressure buildup.
* **Versus the Dunu Davinci:** as much as I was dissatisfied with the Davinci, I would hilariously take this over the Giant as despite having worse details in the lows and a mid-bass that I feel bleeds a bit too much, the comparatively impressive midrange, significantly better tonality, imaging to go with a comparably wide stage and extending highs, make this a better purchase than the Giant.
* **Versus the FatFreq Deuce:** this part will be simpler and short; the Giant in comparison with the Deuce is a substantial improvement barring sub-bass texture.
* **Versus the FatFreq Maestro:** Giant wins in matters of fit and comfort and the Maestro is one of the biggest IEMs that I have tried, but sonically, the Maestro has a far deeper extending sub-bass with an equally enjoyable amount of detail and deliciously smooth highs. Vocals too are so enjoyable on the Maestro.

**Concluding notes:**

I feel I have described more than enough with the Giant, which makes this section massively small. This, in my book, is one of the most disappointing IEMs I have heard and opined on in 2026. I was not expecting Symphonium to miss its mark so heavily on the Giant, given how good the Meteor and Titan specially have been in comparison. If Symphonium wants to drop a competent middle order between both of the aforementioned IEMs, optimistically I would hope for something a lot better than the Giant.

With a heavy heart, I rate the Giant and ***C.*** 

Also, please, people shouldn't be spending more than half an hour just to put the stock eartips on.

Will I buy this at retail? **Never.**

Will I buy this used? **Absolutely not.**

I won't be giving genre recommendations for this IEM because it simply just cannot handle anything that felt satisfying to my ears.

***Comparisons:***

* **Versus the Symphonium Meteor:** this will be short. The Meteor, despite being more affordable in price, outperforms the Giant by a considerable margin. Lows are clearly more pronounced, have better detail; vocals have a healthy amount of weight, timbre is minutely better comparatively, and there's no fatigue. Not to mention, putting eartips on the Meteor is much easier.
* **Versus the Symphonium Titan:** no contest. The price bump in the Titan proves its worth and lays the definition of what “visceral bass” means. Feed the Titan to a good source and just simply enjoy the thunderous, detailed sub-bass that the Titan has. The stage does take a hit, but details, instrument separation, and timbre on the Titan are miles better than the Giant. Again, to summarize, Titan simply is the much better IEM.
* **Versus the Punch Audio Martilo**: this convincingly worsens all arguments for the Giant, as a similar delivery but with more detail and a better, controlled punch in the Martilo puts a big fat question mark on the Giant’s asking price. The only argument Giant has against the Martilo is a much smaller fit, resulting in better comfort and little to no pressure buildup.
* **Versus the Dunu Davinci:** as much as I was dissatisfied with the Davinci, I would hilariously take this over the Giant as despite having worse details in the lows and a mid-bass that I feel bleeds a bit too much, the comparatively impressive midrange, significantly better tonality, imaging to go with a comparably wide stage and extending highs, make this a better purchase than the Giant.
* **Versus the FatFreq Deuce:** this part will be simpler and short; the Giant in comparison with the Deuce is a substantial improvement barring sub-bass texture.
* **Versus the FatFreq Maestro:** Giant wins in matters of fit and comfort and the Maestro is one of the biggest IEMs that I have tried, but sonically, the Maestro has a far deeper extending sub-bass with an equally enjoyable amount of detail and deliciously smooth highs. Vocals too are so enjoyable on the Maestro.

**Concluding notes:**

I feel I have described more than enough with the Giant, which makes this section massively small. This, in my book, is one of the most disappointing IEMs I have heard and opined on in 2026. I was not expecting Symphonium to miss its mark so heavily on the Giant, given how good the Meteor and Titan specially have been in comparison. If Symphonium wants to drop a competent middle order between both of the aforementioned IEMs, optimistically I would hope for something a lot better than the Giant.

With a heavy heart, I rate the Giant and ***C.***

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

I received this unit from [Meesh](https://www.head-fi.org/members/meeshnomore.608194/) who, in collaboration with [Rishabh Negi](https://x.com/YourbroRishabh) sent me this unit, and I am supremely thankful to them.

Symphonium kept the packaging minimal and straight to the point- it advertises the tech involved in the Giant which the bigger sibling in the Titan also has, Phase Harmony Attenuation Technology or PHAT. Sliding the cover out and lifting the Symphonium Audio branded lid, I found a nice card with an etched metal plate with the name of the IEM written along with its serial number. Past that, I found a small carry case that reminded me of the Crinear Daybreak, there’s company branding again and I found the IEMs inside the protective pouch along with the cable. There’s a box labelled Giant, where I found an IEM cleaning tool, a jar of silica gel and various eartips.

I shouldn’t be voicing my displeasure but I have to say this, but these eartips have had some of the worst designing going on as the Giant has a rather large nozzle and these eartips have some of the smallest bores where I spent a good 10-15 minutes trying on the blue bore eartips specially and it was mostly the same with the other eartips I got. 

Stock cable is modular and feels nice in hand, I like this stock cable more than the one that comes with the Titan and comfort is typical Symphonium: small shape and despite the large nozzle, it fit me very well and I had no problems wearing the IEM for extended periods, and there was no pressure buildup.

Enough talk, here’s the sound.  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Lows**

The Symphonium Giant, compared to its other offerings both below and above its retail price, performs in a rather underwhelming manner: the delivery is poorly executed, the proportions bleed into the midrange and it just comes off muffled and too much in quantity as the quality is simply not there, and it feels veiled.

In tracks like Daft Punk’s *Instant Crush* and *Get Lucky*, the Giant simply has the details blurred; I simply couldn't enjoy the otherwise clean and powerful bass lines that both tracks have. And the way the bass overall feels like a congested burp rather than a clean, healthy dollop. And since it sounds muffled while spilling into the midrange, tonality is adversely affected and vocals, as a result, sound thin. This slightly improves when I listen to tracks like Avicii’s Levels, but even in that track, the Giant didn't impress me.

Situation for the Giant further worsens when I switch to tracks like Rush’s *Limelight*, where the granular details on the bass line are fully smudged over to deliver the quantity and ends up ruining the whole sound. Kick drums sound too punchy and lack refinement, and the way it extends — it's delayed and worsens the whole sound further. This also leads to vocals sounding too thin and strained because the bass keeps ‌intruding. The worst part is, towards the end of the track when Neil Peart concludes it with a roll, the bass feels so much so that I had to grip the cartilage of my nose as it was nauseating.

**Mids**

The Giant continues to disappoint me through the midrange by having the whole sound come off congested, strained in parts while delivering a wide stage, which again defeats the entire purpose of having a wide stage. What good is a healthy stage if the IEM cannot do details, instrument separation or tonality the way it should?

In tracks like Animals as Leaders’ *The Woven Web* and Periphery’s *Marigold*, the Giant once again smudges the details that the guitars and cymbals should have. Tonality takes a hit as it cannot decide how it wants to sound, and I really had a hard time penning my thoughts here. Timbre, especially in toms and snares, felt very off — neither consistently natural nor consistently metallic; just simply off.

It is the same when I listen to tracks like Tool’s *Pneuma* and The Police’s *Message in a Bottle* where only the relatively wide stage is the only saving grace. Imaging worsens as these tracks have a lot of instrumental work going on; guitars once again sound unnatural and blurred, vocals feel strained and a bit too laid back for my preference, and that's mostly just about it.

**Highs**

The Giant has its poorest showing here, where I had my hardest time keeping a level head and noting down its performance where I just wanted to take this IEM off my ears and listen to something else because it's just poor.

In tracks like Adele’s *Easy On Me*, the piano maintains a recovery curve in tonality which gets destroyed the moment the vocals kick in: undesirably weighted, thick and completely off in tonality. I just couldn't enjoy this song and especially when the climax of the track comes in where the Giant suddenly sounds fatiguing while losing weight; and I don't want to elaborate further, it was simply just a horrible listen.

In tracks like Kendrick Lamar's *Alright*; I slightly enjoyed listening to it as the Giant offers the punch that this track has but again, the vocals overall felt lethargic and the background hums felt slightly out of place as the Giant prioritized having the horns take center stage. I perceived the cymbals to have a subtle, minute sibilance and, yes, that's about it.

***Comparisons:***

* **Versus the Symphonium Meteor:** this will be short. The Meteor, despite being more affordable in price, outperforms the Giant by a considerable margin. Lows are clearly more pronounced, have better detail; vocals have a healthy amount of weight, timbre is minutely better comparatively, and there's no fatigue. Not to mention, putting eartips on the Meteor is much easier.
* **Versus the Symphonium Titan:** no contest. The price bump in the Titan proves its worth and lays the definition of what “visceral bass” means. Feed the Titan to a good source and just simply enjoy the thunderous, detailed sub-bass that the Titan has. The stage does take a hit, but details, instrument separation, and timbre on the Titan are miles better than the Giant. Again, to summarize, Titan simply is the much better IEM.
* **Versus the Punch Audio Martilo**: this convincingly worsens all arguments for the Giant, as a similar delivery but with more detail and a better, controlled punch in the Martilo puts a big fat question mark on the Giant’s asking price. The only argument Giant has against the Martilo is a much smaller fit, resulting in better comfort and little to no pressure buildup.
* **Versus the Dunu Davinci:** as much as I was dissatisfied with the Davinci, I would hilariously take this over the Giant as despite having worse details in the lows and a mid-bass that I feel bleeds a bit too much, the comparatively impressive midrange, significantly better tonality, imaging to go with a comparably wide stage and extending highs, make this a better purchase than the Giant.
* **Versus the FatFreq Deuce:** this part will be simpler and short; the Giant in comparison with the Deuce is a substantial improvement barring sub-bass texture.
* **Versus the FatFreq Maestro:** Giant wins in matters of fit and comfort and the Maestro is one of the biggest IEMs that I have tried, but sonically, the Maestro has a far deeper extending sub-bass with an equally enjoyable amount of detail and deliciously smooth highs.

There’s a box labelled Giant, where I found an IEM cleaning tool, a jar of silica gel and various eartips.

I shouldn’t be voicing my displeasure but I have to say this, but these eartips have had some of the worst designing going on as the Giant has a rather large nozzle and these eartips have some of the smallest bores where I spent a good 10-15 minutes trying on the blue bore eartips specially and it was mostly the same with the other eartips I got. 

Stock cable is modular and feels nice in hand, I like this stock cable more than the one that comes with the Titan and comfort is typical Symphonium: small shape and despite the large nozzle, it fit me very well and I had no problems wearing the IEM for extended periods, and there was no pressure buildup.

Enough talk, here’s the sound.  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Lows**

The Symphonium Giant, compared to its other offerings both below and above its retail price, performs in a rather underwhelming manner: the delivery is poorly executed, the proportions bleed into the midrange and it just comes off muffled and too much in quantity as the quality is simply not there, and it feels veiled.

In tracks like Daft Punk’s *Instant Crush* and *Get Lucky*, the Giant simply has the details blurred; I simply couldn't enjoy the otherwise clean and powerful bass lines that both tracks have. And the way the bass overall feels like a congested burp rather than a clean, healthy dollop. And since it sounds muffled while spilling into the midrange, tonality is adversely affected and vocals, as a result, sound thin. This slightly improves when I listen to tracks like Avicii’s Levels, but even in that track, the Giant didn't impress me.

Situation for the Giant further worsens when I switch to tracks like Rush’s *Limelight*, where the granular details on the bass line are fully smudged over to deliver the quantity and ends up ruining the whole sound. Kick drums sound too punchy and lack refinement, and the way it extends — it's delayed and worsens the whole sound further. This also leads to vocals sounding too thin and strained because the bass keeps ‌intruding. The worst part is, towards the end of the track when Neil Peart concludes it with a roll, the bass feels so much so that I had to grip the cartilage of my nose as it was nauseating.

**Mids**

The Giant continues to disappoint me through the midrange by having the whole sound come off congested, strained in parts while delivering a wide stage, which again defeats the entire purpose of having a wide stage. What good is a healthy stage if the IEM cannot do details, instrument separation or tonality the way it should?

In tracks like Animals as Leaders’ *The Woven Web* and Periphery’s *Marigold*, the Giant once again smudges the details that the guitars and cymbals should have. Tonality takes a hit as it cannot decide how it wants to sound, and I really had a hard time penning my thoughts here. Timbre, especially in toms and snares, felt very off — neither consistently natural nor consistently metallic; just simply off.

It is the same when I listen to tracks like Tool’s *Pneuma* and The Police’s *Message in a Bottle* where only the relatively wide stage is the only saving grace. Imaging worsens as these tracks have a lot of instrumental work going on; guitars once again sound unnatural and blurred, vocals feel strained and a bit too laid back for my preference, and that's mostly just about it.

**Highs**

The Giant has its poorest showing here, where I had my hardest time keeping a level head and noting down its performance where I just wanted to take this IEM off my ears and listen to something else because it's just poor.

In tracks like Adele’s *Easy On Me*, the piano maintains a recovery curve in tonality which gets destroyed the moment the vocals kick in: undesirably weighted, thick and completely off in tonality. I just couldn't enjoy this song and especially when the climax of the track comes in where the Giant suddenly sounds fatiguing while losing weight; and I don't want to elaborate further, it was simply just a horrible listen.

In tracks like Kendrick Lamar's *Alright*; I slightly enjoyed listening to it as the Giant offers the punch that this track has but again, the vocals overall felt lethargic and the background hums felt slightly out of place as the Giant prioritized having the horns take center stage. I perceived the cymbals to have a subtle, minute sibilance and, yes, that's about it.

***Comparisons:***

* **Versus the Symphonium Meteor:** this will be short. The Meteor, despite being more affordable in price, outperforms the Giant by a considerable margin. Lows are clearly more pronounced, have better detail; vocals have a healthy amount of weight, timbre is minutely better comparatively, and there's no fatigue. Not to mention, putting eartips on the Meteor is much easier.
* **Versus the Symphonium Titan:** no contest. The price bump in the Titan proves its worth and lays the definition of what “visceral bass” means. Feed the Titan to a good source and just simply enjoy the thunderous, detailed sub-bass that the Titan has. The stage does take a hit, but details, instrument separation, and timbre on the Titan are miles better than the Giant. Again, to summarize, Titan simply is the much better IEM.
* **Versus the Punch Audio Martilo**: this convincingly worsens all arguments for the Giant, as a similar delivery but with more detail and a better, controlled punch in the Martilo puts a big fat question mark on the Giant’s asking price. The only argument Giant has against the Martilo is a much smaller fit, resulting in better comfort and little to no pressure buildup.
* **Versus the Dunu Davinci:** as much as I was dissatisfied with the Davinci, I would hilariously take this over the Giant as despite having worse details in the lows and a mid-bass that I feel bleeds a bit too much, the comparatively impressive midrange, significantly better tonality, imaging to go with a comparably wide stage and extending highs, make this a better purchase than the Giant.
* **Versus the FatFreq Deuce:** this part will be simpler and short; the Giant in comparison with the Deuce is a substantial improvement barring sub-bass texture.
* **Versus the FatFreq Maestro:** Giant wins in matters of fit and comfort and the Maestro is one of the biggest IEMs that I have tried, but sonically, the Maestro has a far deeper extending sub-bass with an equally enjoyable amount of detail and deliciously smooth highs. Vocals too are so enjoyable on the Maestro.

**Concluding notes:**

I feel I have described more than enough with the Giant, which makes this section massively small. This, in my book, is one of the most disappointing IEMs I have heard and opined on in 2026. I was not expecting Symphonium to miss its mark so heavily on the Giant, given how good the Meteor and Titan specially have been in comparison. If Symphonium wants to drop a competent middle order between both of the aforementioned IEMs, optimistically I would hope for something a lot better than the Giant.

With a heavy heart, I rate the Giant and ***C.*** 

Also, please, people shouldn't be spending more than half an hour just to put the stock eartips on.

Will I buy this at retail? **Never.**

Will I buy this used? **Absolutely not.**

I won't be giving genre recommendations for this IEM because it simply just cannot handle anything that felt satisfying to my ears.

When we first moved in together my wife told me she only likes light roast coffee. She said dark roast is too bitter and too strong and she cant stand it. She was very firm about this. So I always bought light roast for the house.

About eight years ago I accidentally bought a bag of dark roast. Didnt realize it until I got home and saw the label. I figured Id just drink it myself and get her the right one next time. But I was lazy and made a pot that morning anyway.

She drank it. Said nothing. Didnt notice at all. Said it was good actually.

So the next time I went to the store I bought dark roast again. On purpose this time. She drank it every morning for a week and never said a word. So I just kept buying it.

For eight years.

Every morning this woman drinks dark roast coffee and tells me how good it is. Meanwhile if we go to a coffee shop and they ask what roast she wants she says light because she doesnt like dark. She has sent back coffee at restaurants for being too dark. She has told friends she cant drink dark roast. All while drinking it at home every single day.

Last month she was putting groceries away and actually looked at the coffee bag for the first time in apparently eight years. She held it up and said is this dark roast. I said yep. She said since when. I said since 2017.

She did not laugh.

She said I lied to her. I said I just never corrected her. She said thats the same thing. I said you have literally been drinking it every day and loving it for eight years so clearly you do like dark roast. She said thats not the point.

Shes been buying her own light roast since and making a separate pot every morning. She says its better. I watch her face when she drinks it and Im pretty sure she doesnt think its better but shes committed to proving me wrong.

1r5f4en,https://www.reddit.com/r/wordle/comments/1r5f4en/last_friday_i_got_my_first_one_year_streak_the/,"[####] Last Friday I got my first one year streak. The next day, r/radiohead ruined it. Let’s not be pointlessly cruel to each other.","So, for background context, my wife and I do Wordle, Quordle, and Octordle every day. We add up the scores and whoever’s is lowest wins bragging rights for that day. This takes a few minutes, and we usually do it together while we’re drinking coffee in the morning. It’s a small part of my day that I always look forward to. I don’t remember the last time I actually failed a puzzle, but I tend to forget to do one every few months or so. On Friday, I got my first one year streak, which I’ve been looking forward to for weeks now.

Another thing I tend to do each morning is get on my phone and scroll my Reddit feed. Yesterday, as I was scrolling (before doing Wordle), I ran across a post on  r/radiohead  that said the Wordle solution was a Radiohead song. It instantly pissed me off, because it robbed me of the small bit of joy I get each day from doing this little puzzle. I’ve been listening to Radiohead for 30+ years now, so that post title alone narrowed the solution space down from 2300 to like 3 or 4 words. I forced myself to play the puzzle as I normally would, pretending that I didn’t have this advanced knowledge, but it really soured the experience.

When stuff like this happens, it’s hard to tell if the person just genuinely doesn’t understand that they’re doing harm to other people, or if they do understand and just don’t care. So I decided to call him out for dropping a spoiler in the comments. My comment currently stands at -41 karma, so I’ve accepted that the consensus seems to be that I was being a whiny little bitch for caring about things like playing Wordle each day, and that by getting online each day I am consenting to the possibility of having that small bit of joy taken from me.

If that was the only thing that happened, I could probably carry on feeling good about my one year streak. Sure, the post narrowed the puzzle down to a few words for me, but I still had to solve it. But that’s not the only thing that happened. Someone left a reply to my comment just flat out telling me the solution to today’s (February 15) puzzle. I spent the rest of the day (February 14) hoping that it was just a joke and that he didn’t already know the solution. Sure enough, that was the solution. Again, I tried to play the puzzle as I would have without any advanced knowledge, but my streak is now going to have an asterisk next to it forever.

I get that this is not a big deal at all, and it’s pretty silly to care about things like a Wordle streak, but it really caught me off guard that a stranger somewhere else on the planet could just lob a bit of casual cruelty in your direction and that it could have such an impact. Guys, the world is pretty fucked up right now. It seems like all of the worst people on the planet have seized control of all of our institutions, and there’s not much we can do about it. Can we maybe just call a truce and not be senselessly cruel to strangers on the internet? I’m thinking that maybe whatever dopamine hit we get from the upvotes maybe just isn’t worth it.

EDIT: If you choose to look into my comment history for my massively downvoted comment from yesterday, you will have today’s puzzle spoiled as well.",3,1771163477.0,wordle,7,0.64,False
1r5f40z,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r5f40z,"The Symphonium Giant: a Giant in price, Lilliput in quality","Symphonium Audio is a recent yet powerful entrant into the world of audio, with their in-ear monitors (IEMs) and cables, and two of their offerings are into my personal list of the best I have heard, the Meteor and the Titan and now I have in my hands, their middle order between the aforementioned in the Giant, which doesn’t live up to its name. I received this unit from [Meesh](https://www.head-fi.org/members/meeshnomore.608194/) who, in collaboration with [Rishabh Negi](https://x.com/YourbroRishabh) sent me this unit, and I am supremely thankful to them.

Symphonium kept the packaging minimal and straight to the point- it advertises the tech involved in the Giant which the bigger sibling in the Titan also has, Phase Harmony Attenuation Technology or PHAT. 	Sliding the cover out and lifting the Symphonium Audio branded lid, I found a nice card with an etched metal plate with the name of the IEM written along with its serial number. Past that, I found a small carry case that reminded me of the Crinear Daybreak, there’s company branding again and I found the IEMs inside the protective pouch along with the cable. There’s a box labelled Giant, where I found an IEM cleaning tool, a jar of silica gel and various eartips.

I shouldn’t be voicing my displeasure but I have to say this, but these eartips have had some of the worst designing going on as the Giant has a rather large nozzle and these eartips have some of the smallest bores where I spent a good 10-15 minutes trying on the blue bore eartips specially and it was mostly the same with the other eartips I got.

1r5f410,https://www.reddit.com/r/Miscarriage/comments/1r5f410/first_pregnancy_spontaneous_miscarriage_ended_in/,First pregnancy - spontaneous miscarriage ended in emergency d&c,"Hi folks. 

I think I am posting here to kind of explain what happened to me and process. 

My first pregnancy test was on January 3rd and was very positive. Line went dark almost immediately and while it was a shock I was very excited. My husband and I have been together for a long time and have always wanted kids. 

Something weird, I had been spotting for weeks but coincidentally had been getting over what I suspect was COVID, that has historically always messed with my menstrual cycles. Additionally I was getting the “coffee ground” looking spotting, which was odd and kinda freaking me out. 

Since it was my first pregnancy and I had no idea what I was doing, we went to the ER for the spotting and suspected pregnancy. There they did the urine test which confirmed my pregnancy, and a vaginal ultrasound that reflected an “endometrial decidual reaction” either early pregnancy or a missed miscarriage. 

Not what I was expecting and scared, we also found out I had a huge cyst that was 12 cm. Long story short they couldn’t do much since it was early so I waited for my official appointment at the OB. Second ultrasound saw a small gestational sac, no yolk or fetal pole. I was assured it could be too early and told to come back in a few weeks for another ultrasound. In the meanwhile I had scheduled the regular followup appointments and started to feel like things could be normal, since there’s so much that varies in pregnancy. 

I took a quantitative HCG test which showed levels at around 32k, and my anxiety got the best of me so I was a regular caller of the nurse line at my OB. Was I going to see anything on the next ultrasound? They assured me due to the amount of HCG it was almost a guarantee that something would be seen. 

Next appointment, I was excited. Ready to see what was inside me and confirm that all was well. The radiologist said she could get me photos for my husband and I could find out suspected due date. During the appointment however, I had a second screen where the ultrasound was visible to me- and there was obviously a very empty sac. She was pretty quiet after that and assured me that unfortunately she couldn’t divulge any info but told me “they would be there for me no matter what.”  Honestly it was a sweet sentiment but the sharp turn that occurred from our last conversation scared the hell out of me. We walked to the ultrasound room cheerfully then walked out in silence. 

I cried in my car and told myself that I need to get ready for a loss, because I didn’t want to get my hopes up and cause myself even more sadness. I think I read probably every post on reddit about empty gestational sacs and then a surprise heartbeat and miracle fetus. Doctors are suspicious I caught my pregnancy very early so thus another appointment scheduled. Additionally I am having pregnancy symptoms out the wazoo which had reassured me (but this really means nothing in hindsight)

On a side note it was funny but not funny, every appointment I had to drink 32 oz of water for the tummy ultrasound then, when nothing was visible I had to pee it all out for the vaginal ultrasound. At least I stayed hydrated lol. ANYWAY. 

Final appointment was meant to be this Monday. I called the OB line yet again because the spotting came back and got worse, and I was starting to see some red blood. They said it could be normal since I had a small subchorionic hematoma found in my last ultrasound. Additionally she mentioned that unfortunately if I was miscarrying there is not much that could be done. Understandable, but for this appointment my morale got super low. She did me a solid and found me a last minute ultrasound appointment for that afternoon- and I went. 

Drank the water, knew I was gonna have to probably pee it all out (lol). Lo and behold that is exactly what happened. I asked the radiologist “still showing empty?” She unfortunately confirmed that yes the sac was empty. I was 7 weeks along suspected? Not sure since it was never clear when my last period was. Later that day I got the call from the doctor, they confirmed an early miscarriage and I was to come in the following day to discuss D&C as well as surgery for the cyst around my ovary. 

Around 6:30 PM things took a turn, I felt incredibly faint and started experiencing some bleeding that turned severe. From 6:30 PM to about 2:30 AM I experienced significant blood loss, passing huge clots, and pieces of what I believed to be the gestational sac. I bled through so many pairs of pants and overnight pads my husband ran to grab me diapers, as well as Icy Hot patches and a heating pad because I was experiencing incredibly painful contractions. 

Around 2:00 AM he was concerned and wanted to take me to the ER, I was so emotionally and physically exhausted I hit a small lull where I could get some sleep and asked if we could just wait until the OB appointment the next day at around 11:30AM. I somehow made it through the night passing significant clots and bleeding, I eventually had to wear three diapers to get some sleep without bleeding through everything immediately. 

I wake up at 5:30AM, head to the bathroom, I wake up on the bathroom floor. I passed out for a bit, but the bleeding actually stopped and the cramping stopped. I was relieved and convinced that I was through the worst of it. My husband got me some breakfast and I was able to comfortably nap on the couch until he could drive me to the appointment. On the way to the appointment the familiar gush of blood and clot occurred, and I started to feel faint. 

They immediately sent me to the ER due to significant blood loss, and were concerned as I looked incredibly pale. After another very painful vaginal ultrasound (no shade to the radiologist, I was just struggling) they informed me I had a lot of the sac remaining in my cervix and I remained dilated which is what most likely caused the fainting. 

The doctor did attempt to remove the excess from my cervix but it did not budge and I was so nervous I couldn’t relax. The decision was made to do a D&C in a few hours, and I was terrified but on pain meds and fluids so starting to feel better. Once I got the surgery the doctor informed me there was far more pregnancy tissue than expected, as well as a lot of blood loss. I was advised to stay overnight and I had to get a liter of blood transfused due to my low count. 

Guys the surgery was fine. I was physically shaking in fear on the way to the operating room (first surgery ever) and the only thing I remember is the oxygen mask on my face, then I am awake next to my husband in the recovery room. I feel exhausted but relieved and no longer in extreme pain. Since we didn’t expect to be at the ER I didn’t have my phone charger but it was honestly OK once I found some Golden Girls to watch. 

The doctor was back and forth on giving me an additional liter of blood, but ultimately decided I was OK since I no longer felt faint and I have been put on iron pills and ibuprofen for recovery. I got discharged yesterday and I am finally feeling back to normal. I am relieved that I don’t see horror-movie levels of blood when I have to use the restroom and I’m not in extreme pain waiting for it all to end. 

The weirdest thing to me was how quickly I began miscarrying after the final ultrasound confirmation. In a way it was nice to rip the band aid off however I am still really traumatized from the whole pregnancy, specifically the night I spent naturally miscarrying. The cyst actually decreased in size to 8cm after I started miscarrying, so I think I’m waiting to see if I’m still getting surgery. 

0/10 first pregnancy experience. I think it will be a while until we try again, we are both 29 so there’s some time and I really don’t want to go through this again. My final PSA, don’t be like me and spend a whole night traumatized if you are experiencing really significant blood loss. Based on Google I know I was supposed to go that night, I was just so terrified of the doctor and being in pain stuck waiting in an ER waiting room that I opted to take the risk of potentially bleeding out. 

I take a lot of comfort in reading the stories on this subreddit, I am with you all and I’m so sorry if you had or are having a similar experience. Ultimately I was diagnosed with a blighted ovum, and it did kinda make it better that there was no baby for me to have to see or think about. I think it will be really hard to go through the next pregnancy without assuming the worst after all this, so husband and I are both opting to work on our overall health and be more intentional with trying since this was a surprise.  

Just make sure you take care of yourselves and know it wasn’t your fault. That was something that was comforting to me to hear from the doctor. It’s just something that happens. To me the worst part is browsing pregnancy subreddits and hearing the “well it’s more likely to be healthy than not”. I won the shitty lottery this time unfortunately. In the future I’m going to be far more cognizant of my symptoms and advocate for myself. It was disappointing to learn how little can be done for those first few weeks of pregnancy.

We (my girlfriend and I) went on a road trip just for the day for Valentine’s Day. It was about three hour drive. We were going to spend the day in this little town full of shops and then come back home for dinner.

Well, as we were about to leave I got this feeling in my stomach I found the nearest bathroom, but I was still feeling pretty bad. I was really nauseous and felt like I could throw up at any moment.

She said she would drive home, but she kept offering to stop at coffee shops to get tea, or convenience store to get a Coke to settle my stomach. I knew I just needed water and to get home. I kept telling that, that I just wanted to get home. The more I turned down her suggestions to help, the more angry she got. She kept saying things like “I can’t help you. You’re not taking the steps to help yourself feel better!” Like it’s my fault that I’m sick and I’m choosing to not feel better by drinking tea. I know my body, I know what I need. I needed to rest and drink water. Anything other than water will make it worse.

She was more angry that we weren’t going to go out for dinner as well. She blamed me for ruining the day, and how it was supposed to be a romantic Valentine’s Day. Her only goal was to have a good time and I was getting in the way of that.",3,1771163367.0,BPDlovedones,4,1.0,False

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

So, I'm looking at a potential move to the Seattle area and am wondering about life in and around Seattle. A little about me. I'm mid-fifties, African American, in a same sex relationship. My husband is 10 years younger than me and caucasian. I'm an author of thriller novels and my husband works in tech- cyber security. Because I can work from anywhere, I'm letting my husband pick where we live. His job requires him to travel regularly to an office either in San Francisco or Seattle. We currently live in Charlotte, NC and our choices (based on his current position) are the company headquarters in New York, San Francisco, or Seattle.  
We are leaning towards the Bay Area, but I REALLY love the PNW as well.   
My requirements are pretty simple - coffee shops, great views, outdoor living area, a hot tub, wine, and some good conversation. My hubby is a little more introverted than me, so he can roll with anything lol. His requirements are an area with nice year-round climate (neither of us mind the rain). And being gay, we would like an area that is LGBTQ friendly.  
So, I guess my questions is... how is life in Seattle for those living there? If you are a transplant, are you happy? We understand the cost of living and are fine with that. We just want a quality place with quality people to spend our time with. We would like to be somewhere scenic, single family home, within a 30-45 minute commute into Seattle (train/ferry?). Any and all suggestions would be welcomed.   
Oh, and we also want to be somewhere not too far from really good medical treatment. I'm a worry-wart LOL. Any advice or thoughts are greatly welcomed.",1,1771163283.0,SeattleWA,3,1.0,False

Here is the link to that: https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/lindakra-sleeper-sofa-vissle-dark-gray-60582613/?gad\_source=1&gad\_campaignid=10676958142&gbraid=0AAAAAD27g7wy5tTxcrTrm9F1XFP2u1AxF

Ideally I would want to stay under $500, and the sofa shouldn’t be too big.

My plans for the space are a cozy vibe with lots of warm lighting, coffee table + comfortable sofa, small side table by the touch, walnut wood tv stand, and large area rug to pull the space together. I haven’t decided on what bed frame to get either, but I am going to use the same desk I already have, which is a rich walnut wood - so also open to suggestions for what to go with for that too!!",1,1771162804.0,interiordesignideas,0,1.0,False

You’ve done the screen time. You’ve survived spreads widening during London open. You’ve paid for at least one evaluation that didn’t end the way you planned. And now the question isn’t *can I trade* \- it’s *who is actually worth trusting with scale*.

That’s where [Audacity Capital](https://trade.audacity.capital/user-auth/register?referral_code=676c31&utm_source=client&utm_medium=referral) keeps coming up in European trading circles in 2026.

Not because it’s loud. Not because it promises unrealistic discounts. But because it’s been around long enough for traders in the UK, Germany, France, the Nordics, and Southern Europe to test it under real pressure — payouts, rule enforcement, scaling, and long-term account growth.

This guide is written for European traders who are tired of recycled coupon pages and want something grounded: how Audacity Capital actually works today, what rules matter, and how a verified **BRIDGE** discount fits into the bigger picture without gimmicks.

# What Is Audacity Capital & Is It Legit in Europe?

[Audacity Capital](https://trade.audacity.capital/user-auth/register?referral_code=676c31&utm_source=client&utm_medium=referral) isn’t new, and that matters more in Europe than most people admit. Longevity is one of the few trust signals that survives changing ESMA rules, leverage caps, and platform shifts.

**What makes Audacity Capital one of the top prop trading firms in 2026?**

Audacity Capital started in London and still operates with a European mindset. That shows up in a few practical ways traders notice quickly:

* Clear evaluation structure instead of rotating rule sets
* High drawdown allowances compared to many EU-facing firms
* Scaling paths that actually reach seven-figure capital, not just on marketing pages
* Platforms familiar to European traders, including MT5 and DXTrade

For traders in the UK, Germany, the Netherlands, and Poland, the appeal is consistency. The rules you read today are broadly the rules enforced tomorrow. That stability is rare in 2026.

**How Audacity Capital’s evaluations and funding model works for forex & indices traders**

The core model is simple on paper and demanding in execution.

You choose an evaluation size, trade within defined drawdown limits, hit a profit target, and move into a funded phase. What European traders tend to like is what *isn’t* there anymore: aggressive consistency formulas that punish uneven but profitable trading.

Forex pairs, indices like DAX and FTSE, metals, and selected CFDs are the main focus. That fits how many European traders already structure their sessions around London and New York overlap.

**Trust signals: Reviews, payouts, and community feedback from European traders**

Across Trustpilot, Reddit threads, and long-running forum discussions, European feedback tends to cluster around three themes:

* Payouts are reported as processed when rules are followed
* Disputes usually revolve around rule interpretation, not missing payments
* Long-term traders mention scaling rather than cycling evaluations

That doesn’t mean every experience is perfect. It means issues are visible, discussed, and usually tied to documented rules rather than silence or vanished support.

**Personal experience note:**  
In European trading communities, Audacity Capital isn’t treated like a shortcut. It’s treated like a system. Traders who approach it as a business relationship tend to stay longer than those chasing fast passes.

# Audacity Capital 2026 Rules & How to Pass the Challenge

Rules are where most European traders either build confidence or quietly burn fees. Not because the rules are impossible, but because they’re misunderstood, skimmed, or interpreted through outdated Reddit posts from years ago. In 2026, Audacity Capital’s rule structure is clearer than it’s ever been, but only if you read it the way it’s actually enforced today — not how people *assume* prop firms work.

This section breaks down the rules that matter, why traders fail even when they’re profitable, and what EU and UK traders need to keep in mind beyond the chart.

**What are the current consistency, drawdown, and profit rules in Audacity Capital?**

The biggest change European traders noticed going into 2026 is what *no longer exists*.

There is no enforced consistency rule in the traditional sense. That matters more than it sounds. Many traders in Germany, France, and the Nordics trade uneven sessions by design — heavier exposure during London open, lighter during mid-session chop. Older consistency formulas punished that style even when risk was controlled. Audacity Capital stepped away from that model.

What remains non-negotiable are drawdowns.

Daily drawdown is calculated from equity highs, not balance snapshots. This means intraday spikes followed by reversals can hurt you faster than slow, controlled growth. European indices traders on instruments like DAX and CAC need to be especially careful during high-volatility opens.

Maximum drawdown is absolute. Once breached, the account is done. No appeals, no resets. This is where traders who “average into recovery” usually fail. Audacity Capital’s rules are built to reward restraint, not rescue behavior.

Profit targets are straightforward. There’s no hidden scaling math inside the challenge phase. Hit the target cleanly, respect drawdowns, and trading days accumulate naturally. The minimum trading days requirement exists to filter luck, not to slow skilled traders down.

News trading and weekend holding are allowed under defined conditions. That’s particularly relevant for European traders holding EUR or GBP exposure through ECB or BoE events. Allowed does not mean careless. Slippage during macro releases still counts against drawdown.

Automated strategies and trade copying are permitted. This attracts traders running structured systems rather than discretionary impulse trading. The key point is that risk rules apply to systems exactly the same way they apply to manual traders.

**Common reasons traders fail the challenge and how to avoid them**

Most failed evaluations aren’t blown in dramatic fashion. They quietly bleed out through small, repeated mistakes.

The most common issue is drawdown miscalculation. Traders focus on balance instead of equity. They see green closed trades and assume safety, while floating drawdown quietly creeps toward the limit. This is especially common among scalpers trading EURUSD or NASDAQ CFDs during overlapping sessions.

Another frequent problem is position sizing drift. A trader starts conservatively, strings together wins, and gradually increases lot size without recalibrating risk. One unexpected reversal during a volatile European morning wipes out the buffer.

Revenge trading still exists, even among experienced traders. A stopped-out trade just before London open can trigger impulsive re-entries. Audacity Capital’s rules don’t forgive emotional corrections. Each trade is judged on risk, not intent.

Holding through illiquid periods is another silent killer. Late Friday trades on indices or exotic FX pairs can gap into Monday’s open. Weekend holding is allowed, but liquidity risk belongs entirely to the trader.

The traders who pass consistently tend to do boring things well. Fixed risk per trade. Hard stops that are respected. No attempts to “optimize” drawdown usage. They treat the challenge like a probation period, not a performance showcase.

**What EU/UK traders need to know about tax and compliance when trading funded accounts**

This is where confusion spreads fastest, especially across borders.

[Audacity Capital](https://trade.audacity.capital/user-auth/register?referral_code=676c31&utm_source=client&utm_medium=referral) does not act as a broker for retail clients in the traditional sense. Traders operate within a simulated or proprietary environment and are paid based on performance. That distinction matters for compliance but does not remove tax responsibility.

In the UK, profits received from funded accounts are commonly treated as income rather than capital gains, depending on individual circumstances. Many traders operate through sole trader structures or limited companies, but that choice depends on personal advice, not prop firm policy.

Across the EU, treatment varies by country. Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and the Nordics each apply their own frameworks. What stays consistent is this: payouts are taxable. There is no automatic withholding done by the firm. Responsibility sits with the trader.

Payment currencies are typically USD, but European traders often convert into EUR or GBP through their payment provider or bank. Exchange fees and timing can impact net results, especially on larger payouts.

Compliance also means respecting local restrictions. Some jurisdictions limit access to certain platforms or instruments. Traders are expected to ensure participation is permitted where they reside. Audacity Capital outlines restricted regions clearly, and European traders should cross-check with their local regulations rather than relying on forum interpretations.

**Personal experience note:**  
The traders who last longest aren’t the ones gaming rules. They’re the ones who treat compliance, risk, and taxation as part of trading itself. Once you accept that funded trading is a business, not a loophole, the rules stop feeling restrictive and start feeling predictable.

# Audacity Capital Pricing & Discount Landscape (Verified)

Pricing is where European traders lose the most time — not money at first, but clarity. By the time money is involved, confusion has already done the damage. In 2026, Audacity Capital pricing itself is not complicated. What complicates it is everything layered on top of it by coupon sites, outdated blog posts, and recycled Reddit threads that haven’t been checked in years.

This section strips pricing back to reality: what evaluations actually cost, why extreme discount claims keep circulating, and what “verified” really means in practice for traders based in Europe.

**How much does each evaluation cost without discounts (EUR/USD prices)**

[Audacity Capital](https://trade.audacity.capital/user-auth/register?referral_code=676c31&utm_source=client&utm_medium=referral) prices its evaluations in USD, but European traders almost always experience them in EUR or GBP once bank conversion and payment processing are applied. That matters because the final number on your statement is what affects your risk budget, not the sticker price.

Smaller accounts sit in the lower two-figure range, designed to let traders test rule fit without committing serious capital. Mid-tier accounts, which are the most popular in Europe, scale up steadily and tend to fall into the range where conversion fees start to matter more than the headline cost.

Large evaluations, especially those targeting six-figure capital with long-term scaling potential, are priced deliberately higher. This isn’t accidental. Audacity Capital filters for traders who already think in terms of capital efficiency rather than cheap entry.

European traders often underestimate how pricing interacts with psychology. A €40 or €50 difference on checkout feels minor, but repeated resets or failed evaluations quickly multiply that number. That’s why understanding real pricing upfront matters more than chasing the lowest visible number.

Another detail many miss is fee structure behavior after passing. Refund policies and payout mechanics differ between evaluation paths. Some routes refund the evaluation fee on first payout. Others structure costs as sunk access fees. The pricing page explains this clearly, but only if read slowly.

For EU traders operating in EUR zones, exchange rate timing can slightly shift final cost. GBP-based traders may notice larger swings depending on payment provider. None of this changes the rules, but it changes your effective cost base.

**Why many publicly listed codes claiming 30–80% off are fake or expired (historical coupon info)**

If you search for Audacity Capital discount codes in Europe, you’ll see numbers that don’t make sense. Thirty percent. Fifty percent. Sometimes even eighty percent. These numbers trigger clicks because they trigger hope.

Most of these codes fall into three categories.

First, expired campaign codes. These were real at some point, often tied to anniversaries or short-term promotions. Coupon sites scrape them once, then never update them. Years later, they’re still listed as “active” despite failing at checkout.

Second, conditional influencer promos. These codes worked only on specific account sizes, during limited windows, or alongside other restrictions. When those conditions ended, the codes silently stopped working. Screenshots linger, reality changes.

Third, fabricated placeholders. Some coupon aggregators generate codes algorithmically to rank pages, not to help traders. They were never issued by the firm in the first place. Traders only find out after entering payment details.

European traders are particularly exposed to this because many coupon sites localize aggressively. A page targeting Germany or Italy may list a “local” discount that never existed, relying on language trust rather than verification.

Audacity Capital itself does not rotate high-percentage public discounts year-round. That alone should make extreme claims suspect. Sustained discounts above a certain threshold simply don’t align with how prop firms manage risk and trader filtering.

**A realistic overview of current verified codes available in 2026**

In 2026, verified discounts fall into a much narrower and more realistic range.

Some seasonal promotions appear briefly around anniversaries or major events. These are time-bound and clearly labeled. When they end, they end.

Some small percentage reductions exist through referral or partner programs, often in the single-digit range. These are usually not lifetime offers and may apply only once.

Then there are long-term verified codes that persist because they are built into structured partnerships rather than campaigns. These codes don’t promise unrealistic percentages. They promise reliability.

The key difference between verified and non-verified discounts is repeatability. A verified code works today, tomorrow, and next month. It doesn’t disappear after one use. It doesn’t depend on timing luck.

European traders who buy larger evaluations feel this difference more than anyone. A five percent reduction might save a coffee. A meaningful, consistent reduction compounds across resets, upgrades, and scaling phases.

The safest way to assess any code is simple. Does it apply at checkout without conditions being added last-minute? Does it work across account sizes? Does it still work after public promotions end?

If the answer to any of those is no, the code is not designed for long-term use, regardless of how attractive the headline number looks.

**Personal experience note:**  
After watching traders across the UK, Germany, and Southern Europe cycle through failed codes, the pattern becomes obvious. Real savings in prop trading don’t come from lucky coupons. They come from using fewer evaluations and choosing discounts that don’t vanish when you need them again.

# BRIDGE Exclusive — How to Get 25% Off Any Audacity Capital Evaluation

This is the part most traders want to jump to first. That makes sense. Evaluation fees add up fast, especially for European traders who don’t stop at one account size. But before talking about the discount itself, it’s important to understand *why*this one exists, why it hasn’t disappeared, and why it behaves differently from the flashy numbers floating around online.

This section explains exactly what **BRIDGE** does, how to apply it correctly, and why it matters far more for serious traders than it initially appears.

**What your ""BRIDGE"" code does (25% off any plan, forever) — explained clearly**

The **BRIDGE** code applies a flat 25% reduction to Audacity Capital evaluations. No tiers. No hidden conditions. No requirement to wait for a seasonal campaign.

It works on all evaluation sizes. Small accounts, medium accounts, large accounts. Whether a trader starts modestly or goes straight for a larger capital path, the percentage remains the same.

It also works across evaluation types. That distinction matters. Many traders assume discounts only apply to entry-level challenges. With **BRIDGE**, the reduction applies consistently, regardless of whether the evaluation is positioned as standard, advanced, or designed for scaling.

“Forever” in this context means something very specific. The code does not expire based on calendar dates. It does not disappear after one use. It does not deactivate once a public promotion ends. Traders can use it again if they reset, upgrade, or return later.

That permanence is rare in prop trading. Most discounts are marketing tools designed to drive short-term signups. Once the campaign ends, so does the benefit. **BRIDGE** is structured differently because it’s not tied to urgency. It’s tied to ongoing access.

For European traders, this consistency solves a practical problem. Many don’t pass on the first attempt. Not because they lack skill, but because adapting to a firm’s rules takes time. A code that only works once provides psychological pressure. A code that works every time reduces friction.

The discount is applied before payment processing, which means it reduces the base cost, not just the displayed total. That affects VAT calculations and conversion fees indirectly, especially for traders paying in EUR or GBP.

**Step-by-step: How to apply your BRIDGE discount in checkout**

Using the **BRIDGE** code is straightforward, but mistakes still happen, usually because traders rush.

First, select your evaluation directly from Audacity Capital’s official site. Avoid third-party mirrors or redirected checkout links. This ensures pricing and availability are current.

Second, choose your account size deliberately. The discount does not change based on size, so this is the moment to think long-term rather than cheap entry. Many European traders plan to scale, and starting with a slightly larger account often reduces total evaluation cycles later.

Third, proceed to checkout and locate the promo code field. Enter **BRIDGE** exactly as written. Case sensitivity typically does not matter, but spelling does. Extra spaces or copied formatting can cause errors.

Once applied, the price updates immediately. There should be no pop-ups asking for additional conditions, no messages about limited availability, and no warnings about incompatibility with your chosen plan.

If the price does not change, stop. Do not complete payment. Recheck spelling. Refresh the page if needed. A working code applies visibly before payment is finalized.

After confirmation, complete payment through your chosen method. European traders often use cards or regional payment providers. The discounted price should be reflected on your receipt and dashboard.

If a trader returns weeks or months later to purchase another evaluation, the same steps apply. There is no activation limit tied to your account.

**Why this matters for medium & large accounts (€50k to €2M account plans)**

The real value of **BRIDGE** shows up at scale.

For a small evaluation, 25% might feel like a modest saving. For medium accounts, it becomes noticeable. For large accounts, it becomes strategic.

European traders are more likely than many global peers to pursue larger funded capital. This is partly due to trading styles focused on indices and partly due to risk frameworks that favor lower leverage with higher notional exposure.

When evaluation fees rise into the hundreds or thousands, a consistent percentage reduction compounds quickly. One failed attempt followed by a reset still benefits. An upgrade to a higher tier still benefits. Scaling paths toward seven-figure capital continue to benefit.

This changes how traders approach risk. Knowing that future evaluations are discounted removes the temptation to overtrade or rush profit targets. Traders are less likely to “force” a pass because the cost of another attempt feels manageable rather than punitive.

It also discourages discount-hopping. Many traders waste time searching for better codes that don’t exist. They delay decisions, miss market conditions, or enter challenges at the wrong time. A reliable discount removes that distraction.

For traders targeting the upper end of Audacity Capital’s scaling structure, the discount effectively lowers the cost of accessing institutional-style capital. Over time, that difference can outweigh small variations in spreads or commissions.

**Personal experience note:**  
Among European traders who treat prop trading as a long-term path, the ones who progress fastest are rarely chasing the biggest advertised discount. They’re choosing certainty. A code that works every time quietly saves more money than one that looks impressive once and never works again.

# Worst vs Best Discount Codes — What European Traders Should Avoid

Discount codes look harmless. They sit quietly at checkout, promise savings, and feel like a small win before the real work starts. But in prop trading, especially for European traders buying medium to large accounts, discount codes shape behavior far more than most people realise. They influence timing, risk decisions, and even which firms traders choose to trust.

This section is not about chasing bigger numbers. It’s about understanding which discounts quietly cost traders money over time, and which ones actually support a sustainable trading path.

**Why “30%+ off” codes on coupon sites are often expired or invalid**

The first red flag is scale. Discounts above 30% are not impossible in prop trading, but they are almost always temporary. When those numbers keep appearing month after month on coupon sites, something is off.

Most of these listings are not maintained by traders. They are maintained by automated content systems designed to rank pages, not verify accuracy. Once a code appears online, it can stay indexed for years, long after the firm has disabled it.

European traders are especially targeted here. Localised pages promise “Germany exclusive” or “UK special” discounts that were never region-specific in the first place. Language creates trust. Familiar currency symbols create comfort. But the checkout page tells the truth.

Another issue is silent restriction. Some codes technically apply but only to the smallest account size, or only during a short promotional window. Traders don’t notice until they switch to a larger evaluation and the discount vanishes.

Then there are placeholder codes. These are not expired. They were never real. Coupon sites invent combinations that look plausible. Traders only find out at checkout, after spending time comparing options.

The psychological damage matters more than the failed discount. Traders feel rushed. They feel tricked. Some proceed without a discount out of frustration. Others delay trading entirely, waiting for a deal that never comes.

In Europe, where many traders trade part-time alongside work or studies, timing matters. Missing a clean market window because you were hunting a fake code is a real cost.

**How to check if a promo code is truly working before spending money**

There is a simple process that filters real codes from noise.

First, ignore percentages. Focus on behavior. Does the code apply instantly at checkout without additional steps? If not, treat it as unreliable.

Second, test repeatability. A genuine code should not depend on a single-use trigger. If it works once and disappears, it’s promotional, not structural.

Third, test scalability. Switch account sizes before paying. A working code should not disappear when you move from a small account to a larger one unless clearly stated.

Fourth, watch language. Real discounts don’t rely on urgency phrases. They don’t say “last chance today” every day. They don’t reset countdown timers.

Fifth, check trader feedback, not influencer posts. European forums, Reddit threads, and long-running discussions reveal patterns quickly. If multiple traders confirm recent successful use, that’s more valuable than any landing page.

The most important check is restraint. Never complete payment hoping a discount will be applied later or refunded manually. If it doesn’t apply clearly before payment, walk away.

**Reddit-friendly warnings on fake coupon threads & how to verify live codes**

Reddit is one of the best and worst places for discount information.

It’s good because traders are blunt. When a code doesn’t work, they say so. It’s bad because old threads resurface constantly through search results, long after conditions have changed.

Fake coupon threads usually share certain traits. They rely on screenshots instead of live confirmation. They reference “worked for me last year.” They include long lists of codes without explanation.

Another pattern is comment manipulation. Early comments praise a code. Later comments questioning it are ignored or downvoted. That usually signals an affiliate-driven thread rather than genuine discussion.

Verification on Reddit comes from recent, specific confirmations. Look for comments mentioning the current month or week. Look for traders mentioning the exact account size they used. Vague confirmations are not confirmations.

The reason **BRIDGE** stands out in these discussions is not marketing language. It’s consistency. Traders mention it months apart with the same outcome. No urgency. No expiry panic.

That stability matters in European trading culture. Many traders prefer slow accumulation over fast wins. A discount that behaves predictably fits that mindset.

**Personal experience note:**  
Watching traders across the UK, Italy, and Eastern Europe cycle through fake discount threads is frustrating because the outcome is always the same. The biggest losses aren’t from bad trades. They come from rushed decisions triggered by discounts that never existed.

# Audacity Capital for Large Account Traders in Europe

Large account trading changes everything. Risk stops being theoretical. Drawdowns stop feeling small. European traders who move beyond entry-level evaluations quickly discover that scale exposes discipline gaps that smaller accounts hide.

This is why Audacity Capital continues to attract serious European traders in 2026. Not through aggressive marketing, but through a structure that behaves predictably when size increases.

**Which Audacity Capital funded plans suit large accounts?**

Large-account traders usually trade fewer instruments, focus on drawdown maths, and measure performance in months, not weeks.

European traders targeting €50k+ accounts gravitate toward evaluations where:

* Maximum drawdown is reasonable relative to profit targets
* Aggressive consistency formulas are absent
* Trading periods are flexible rather than rushed

Uneven performance is normal at scale. One or two strong sessions per week often carry the month. Audacity Capital’s 2026 structure aligns with that reality.

Platform choice also matters. MT5 suits structured, multi-timeframe traders. DXTrade appeals to execution-focused traders. The key point is that platform limits don’t force strategy changes.

What large traders avoid are fast-pass style plans with tight drawdowns and high targets. Speed looks attractive at small size, but volatility punishes it as position size grows.

**Scaling from $15k to $2M without chasing fake discounts**

Scaling is not linear.

Most European traders progress in steps:

* Smaller evaluations confirm rule fit
* Mid-sized accounts test discipline under pressure
* Larger allocations follow only after behaviour stabilises

A common mistake is changing strategy mid-scale. Traders pass smaller accounts conservatively, then increase aggression because “there’s more room.” That logic breaks quickly.

Another mistake is discount chasing. Waiting for bigger discounts delays progress and costs more over time. A reliable, repeatable reduction matters far more than chasing numbers that rarely work.

Audacity Capital’s scaling framework rewards steadiness. Regular payouts help traders treat profits as income, not windfalls, which reduces emotional pressure as size increases.

Seven-figure trading is less about skill and more about process maturity. Traders who reach it usually already operate like fund managers before the capital reflects it.

**European market nuances (EUR/GBP, payouts, indices)**

Europe is not one market, and large traders feel this sharply.

* Most traders earn in USD and spend in EUR or GBP
* Exchange timing affects net income at scale
* Fast payouts reduce emotional over-exposure
* European indices behave very differently from US indices
* Conservative leverage culture fits Audacity Capital’s structure

Small frictions compound at size. What feels minor at €10k becomes serious at €100k and critical at €1M. Firms that minimise friction retain serious traders longer.

**Personal experience note:**  
European traders who scale successfully stop thinking in “accounts” and start thinking in operations. When trading feels boring and predictable, scale usually follows.

# Alternatives to Audacity Capital — When Comparison Makes Sense

Comparing firms is not disloyal. It’s responsible.

European traders compare brokers, platforms, and execution venues. Prop firms deserve the same scrutiny.

**Smarter questions to ask when comparing**

The wrong questions are about price. The right questions are about structure.

* How stable have the rules been over time?
* What happens when traders grow?
* Does drawdown logic match your trading style?
* Does the firm suit European sessions and indices?
* How are disputes actually handled?

Most traders who leave Audacity Capital do so for a specific structural reason, not surface-level perks.

**One-question audit: real funding or marketing deals?**

Real funding is boring. It limits behaviour and rewards discipline.

Marketing-driven funding looks exciting but often fails at scale. The easiest audit is payout stories:

* Sustainable firms show steady withdrawals
* Weak models show isolated “first payout” posts

This is where structured review platforms matter. Sites like Prop Firm Bridge have become popular with EU traders because they focus on rule behaviour, scaling logic, and long-term viability — not hype or rotating deals. That approach saves traders months of trial and error.

**Reading Trustpilot and reviews correctly**

Star ratings alone mean nothing.

Look for:

* Patterned complaints, not single stories
* Recent reviews reflecting current rules
* Calm, detailed feedback over emotional posts
* Consistency across Trustpilot, forums, Reddit, and review sites

European traders often write precise, measured reviews. Those details are far more valuable than scores.

**Personal experience note:**  
Traders who compare properly rarely regret their decision — even if they stay. Comparison turns prop trading from a gamble into a business choice.

# Audacity Capital Risk Management & Trader Safety

Risk management is understood in theory and ignored under pressure. In Europe, this gap widens because many traders come from regulated retail environments.

Audacity Capital’s risk model is simple and strict:

* Maximum drawdown is absolute
* Daily drawdown is equity-based
* Position sizing is the trader’s responsibility
* News trading is allowed, risk is not adjusted

Equity-based drawdowns cause most confusion. Floating losses count immediately, even when balance is positive.

Correlation risk is another blind spot. EUR pairs, DAX, and FTSE often move together. Multiple positions can behave like one oversized trade.

**Why traders report “inconsistent” enforcement**

Most issues come from:

* Misunderstanding equity drawdowns
* Slippage during high volatility
* Server-time confusion across EU time zones

True edge cases exist, but European traders report that documented issues are reviewed. Evidence matters more than emotion.

Education reduces almost all friction. Many traders rely on independent rule breakdowns and review platforms to understand how rules behave in practice, not just on paper.

**Protecting a funded account long-term**

Long-term traders:

* Stay far inside drawdown limits
* Use percentage-based risk
* Trade defined sessions
* Avoid overtrading
* Withdraw profits regularly
* Keep basic logs

Funded capital is not personal capital. Treating it professionally is what keeps it.

**Personal experience note:**  
The longest-lasting European funded traders don’t trade harder. They trade quieter. When risk feels boring, safety usually follows.



# FAQ

Questions around [Audacity Capital](https://trade.audacity.capital/user-auth/register?referral_code=676c31&utm_source=client&utm_medium=referral) tend to repeat across Europe, but the intent behind them changes with experience level. Newer traders want reassurance. Experienced traders want operational clarity. Large-account traders want to know where friction hides.

This FAQ is written with all three in mind, focusing on how things actually work in 2026 for traders based in the UK and across the EU.

# How long does it take to get funded with Audacity Capital in Europe?

The timeline depends far more on trading behavior than on geography.

Once an evaluation is purchased, traders can begin immediately. There is no waiting period tied to European residency. The challenge itself does not impose artificial delays beyond minimum trading days, which exist to reduce luck-based passes rather than slow down skilled traders.

Some traders complete evaluations in a few weeks. Others take months intentionally, trading fewer sessions to protect drawdown. Both approaches are valid. Audacity Capital does not penalise slower progress as long as rules are respected.

After passing, account transition is typically handled without long delays. European traders report funded access being granted within standard processing windows, assuming verification steps are completed cleanly.

What matters most is not speed, but stability. Traders who rush tend to fail more often. Traders who pace themselves often reach funding with fewer resets, which matters more over time.

# Can I use my BRIDGE 25% code on any challenge or funded plan?

Yes. The ""**BRIDGE""** code applies across all evaluation sizes and types.

There is no restriction limiting it to entry-level challenges or first-time purchases. Traders can use it on smaller evaluations, medium accounts, and larger paths designed for scaling.

It is not tied to seasonal promotions. It does not stop working after one use. It is not overridden by public campaigns ending.

This consistency is particularly useful for European traders who progress in stages. Whether you are testing fit with a smaller account or moving directly into a higher capital bracket, the reduction applies the same way.

The only requirement is that it is entered correctly during checkout. If applied, the price reduction is visible immediately before payment.

# Will the discount work with free trials or seasonal promos?

Free trials are separate from paid evaluations and typically do not accept discount codes, including **BRIDGE**, because there is no price to reduce.

Seasonal promotions are different. In most cases, the **BRIDGE** code remains valid even when public promotions are running. If a promotion offers a lower percentage than **BRIDGE**, the better option applies. If a promotion offers a higher short-term reduction, traders can choose which to use.

What matters is transparency. The discount applied at checkout is the one that counts. There is no stacking of codes, and no retroactive adjustment after payment.

European traders who prefer predictability often ignore seasonal offers entirely and stick with a consistent reduction rather than timing campaigns.

# Is Audacity Capital suitable for beginner traders?

Suitability depends on mindset more than experience.

Audacity Capital does not teach trading. It evaluates risk management and consistency. Beginners who approach it as a learning environment often struggle, because evaluation fees create pressure.

However, beginners who already trade demo accounts seriously and understand drawdown mechanics can use Audacity Capital as a structured test of discipline.

The absence of aggressive consistency rules helps newer traders who are still developing rhythm, but drawdown enforcement is strict. There is little room for emotional mistakes.

Many European beginners choose to study prop firm rules deeply before attempting evaluations. Independent review platforms and educational sites focused on rule clarity help bridge that gap by explaining expectations in practical terms rather than marketing language.

# What markets can I trade with a funded account?

Audacity Capital supports a range of instruments commonly traded by European traders.

Forex pairs form the core, including major and minor pairs. European indices such as DAX and FTSE are popular due to liquidity during local sessions. Metals and selected CFDs are also available.

Instrument availability can vary slightly by platform, but the focus remains on liquid markets where execution quality is more predictable.

Traders should always confirm instrument lists on their chosen platform before committing, especially if their strategy depends on specific assets.

# Does Audacity Capital pay in EUR/GBP or only USD?

Payouts are generally processed in USD. European traders typically receive funds through payment providers or banks that handle currency conversion into EUR or GBP.

This means exchange rates and processing fees are external factors. Traders managing larger payouts often plan conversions strategically to reduce costs.

Audacity Capital does not currently fix payouts in local European currencies, but this has not been a major barrier for traders accustomed to USD-denominated trading environments.

Understanding this upfront helps avoid surprises and allows traders to factor net income into their planning.

**Personal experience note:**  
Most frustration around funded trading comes from unanswered questions that were never asked properly. Traders who take time to understand timelines, payouts, and rule mechanics upfront tend to trade with far more confidence once capital is on the line.

1r5eoax,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1r5eoax/aitah_for_telling_gf_to_stop_talking_to_her/,AITAH for telling gf to stop talking to her friends?,"My (28 M) gf (23 F) had gone out of state for work (she works at her company's last year, and while there she cheated on me with a coworker. I discovered this when she asked me to send her a document from her laptop which she left at my place. 

As I was looking for the document, WhatsApp notifications (she has her phone linked to the Windows app) were popping up and one message that contained my name in it caught my attention. I got curious and opened the chats.

Long story short, another coworker they met at the field office was giving her attention, buying her coffee, drinks, food etc. She was telling her friends and sisters that she doesn't think she loves me anymore, she wants to end things but she doesn't want to be one to call the relationship off. 

She also was telling them that I'm broke, unambitious, (I make more than her, I pay for all the utilities, groceries, rent, dates.. I'm kinda traditional), I don't treat her well (I try. I take her on dates, do the majority of the housework, cooking, cleaning, because she's always tired when she comes back from work, yet I work more hours than her, I have never hit her, yet she told her friends that I ""threaten"" her; she rarely accepts when she's wrong. She'll turn it around on me, saying the tone I used was wrong, etc.. typical gaslighting).

Anyway, I sent her the document she wanted, and didn't say anything about what I saw. I waited for her to return, which was a month later. I was to pick her up from the airport but I made up some excuse not to and told her to take an Uber, and was not at home when she arrived. When I got back to the apartment, she was all loving, saying she missed me and wanted sex. Again I made up some excuse about not feeling well and she got suspicious, asking what was wrong and why I was acting weird. I said nothing was wrong and went to sleep.

In the morning I woke up before her and left for work. While at work I sent her a message saying I know everything and when I get back from work I don't want to find her there, then blocked her. I found her things gone and her too. Then a few days later she started calling using different numbers saying she was sorry and for us to work things out, she even involved her mother who I respect and consider as my mother too.

Out of respect for her mother and because I thought people make mistakes and we can change, I let her back in on the condition that she blocks her affair partner and friends that knew she was in a relationship with me but still supported and encouraged her cheating. She agreed to all these.

Fast forward to last week, I discovered that she didn't block her fling immediately. She continued talking to him for some days after reconciling, then blocked him and as far as I know they haven't been talking since. Which means she lied. She also didn't cut contact with her friends. When I confronted her she said her friends have been her support system and she can't just block them. She even told her friends that I told her to block them and they were laughing about how foolish and insecure I am.

So I told her that since she had chosen her friends over me, the relationship might as well end, and she said it's okay, let it end. No remorse, no second thoughts. Which told me that she had thought about this long. 

So, here we are. Some of my friends say I have no right to choose her friends for her, I overreacted and they say if she was no longer cheating or talking to her affair partner then I had no reason to tell her to stop talking to her friends. Some say what I asked her to do was justified.

To be clear, I've no intention of progressing beyond being an extra, a living furniture prop!

Living in UK, ordinary mid 40s guy, had an ordinary job until last year when I quit. I did a one off extra role on a BBC production, what's funny is, I don't watch TV or have a TV license so I've never even seen it! I did two scenes, I was told by my neighbour that I appeared, but I've no idea which scene, or for how long. That doesn't matter

Anyway even though probably 85% of the time was spent sat in a waiting room until being called onto set, I absolutely loved it, I was just fascinated by seeing scenes being filmed in person, even if I was stood off camera after my 12 seconds of unnoticed fame! I decided I wanna do as much as I can, and since there's a real risk of me possibly getting enough money that I'd need to declare income, I'm gonna register as self employed and get back on the books this coming financial year.

  
The irony... I'm not a confident person, I can't act and wouldn't dream of standing in front of a camera and being any kind of focal point, unless I've no real lines or nothing complicated to do, but I've no problem at all being that passer-by in the background where, unless someone I know instantly recognised me, I'd go completely under the radar.

I think I like it more than anyone's supposed to.. and that's ok.

I'm well aware that some people see the ""extras"" as almost on the same level as the office ""youth"" that's hired to make the tea for the guy that makes the coffee. But I loved doing it. At the time I did the bbc production, I'd actually been selected for 4 separate productions, the BBC one, two films and even a music video. I wasn't in a position to accept the other 3 and what devastated me is I was contacted a week after the BBC one to be in more scenes and I couldn't go, so I could have been in more scenes.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

I love the arts, including visual, sculptural, music, performance, and poetry. I’m also a foodie and enjoy dining at the best restaurants in the Boston area, and beyond. Unless you object, I will cover all meals, entertainment, travel, and the like when we are together. Call me old school.

I’m looking to meet someone for fun that could lead to a new emotional and intellectual and physical relationship. We can start with chats, followed by coffee or dinners in Boston’s best restaurants, my treat, and go from there. If it feels right, we can start a real relationship and perhaps even something long term. I can host.

My few weeks on Reddit have been very educational due to all the fakes out there. Depressing, if occasionally absurd to the point of funny. I note this because I am looking for a real person open to the possibility of a real relationship, NOT a client relationship. So please don’t waste your time and mine if you are looking for someone to send you bucks before meeting.

Please send me a DM if interested. We can exchange more info about our more private likes and dislikes in chat, and photos as well.

The kids pushed back and said you can get them without coffee. I told her we could make them with cream base, no caffeine, basically just sugar and milk.
She paused. Looked at them. And then she said, “Oh. You’re right. I was wrong. Sorry.”
That’s it. No sarcasm. No tight smile. No weird “well ACTUALLY.” Just… sorry. Casual. Easy. Like it didn’t cost her anything.
The kids didn’t flinch. That’s the part that’s stuck in my chest. They didn’t brace. They didn’t look up at her face like they were checking if it was safe to breathe. They just smiled and ordered. Like this was normal. Like adults admitting they’re wrong is just… part of life.

My mom would rather bite her own tongue off than admit she was wrong in front of me. If I corrected her on anything, even tiny stuff, it turned into a whole thing. Disrespect. Attitude. “After everything I do for you.” I remember being maybe nine? and telling her my school project was due Thursday, not Friday. I said it gently. I swear I did. She snapped that I was trying to make her look stupid. I ended up turning it in late because she wouldn’t drive me the right day. And somehow that was my fault too.
Watching that woman apologize today felt like seeing a glitch in the matrix. Like oh. This is how it can be.
One of the kids had those light-up sneakers, the kind that flash blue with every step. They were just standing there, shoes blinking, waiting for their drinks. No tension in their shoulders. No scanning the room. I don’t know why that detail won’t leave me alone. Maybe because I spent so much of my childhood scanning. Listening for tone shifts. Measuring footsteps in the hallway. Trying to predict explosions before they happened. I didn’t even realize how much of my brain is still wired like that.
I’m an adult. I have my own place. I pay my bills. I don’t live with her. But something about hearing a parent say “I was wrong” so simply just… hurt. In a quiet way. Like I missed out on something small but huge at the same time.
Some kids grow up hearing “sorry.”
Some of us grew up hearing “how dare you.”
And I guess I’m just tired tonight. It’s weird how one tiny, healthy moment can crack open a whole pile of old stuff you thought you’d packed away. I don’t even know what to do with that. I just needed to say it somewhere because it feels heavy and I can’t sleep and I keep seeing those stupid blue flashing sneakers in my head.",89,1771161527.0,raisedbynarcissists,7,0.98,False

In your arms, swaddled and quiet was our newly born child. I smiled and lay back in the uncomfortable hospital chair. It was February 6 2026, I think. As I drifted off for my first sleep in 36 hours I thought of the journey we'd been on and how we arrived at the maternity Hospital, six miles from the centre of London but light years away from the tourists of Big Ben, nestled in the centre of a foredt.

2024 had ended badly for both of us. You can tell me your back story when we chat but in my case I'd had a horrible break up. Although my girlfriend had not been physically abusive, it has been tough. I'd finally left when money which was allocated to a honeymoon disappeared from our joint account.

I'd managed to find a place to live, a few hundred meters from the forest and running slowly in the mud was a lovely escape. I'm a little overweight and not exactly athletic but I was improving. A real impetus to run was that this equally chubby but beautiful woman seemed to run in the same place as me. I'd seen her on Wood Street getting coffee and we always seemed to time our runs so we were out at the same time. 

in the run up to Christmas it was muddy and we ended up having to walk through a particularly difficult spot. After weeks of silence, we finally exchanged words. We started to run together a little: maybe we could get a coffee after the run. As we slowly jogged, there was chemistry. I felt a happiness I'd not known in months. 

However, a tree root abruptly inserted itself between your foot and our happy jog, leaving you a muddy, painful mess on the ground.

Three hours later, I was getting terrible coffee outside the emergency department and buying magazines. Your wrist would require surgery. I felt a responsibility to wait with you. I smiled a little too long when you mocked my choice of magazines. Our hands lingered in each other's a tiny bit longer than they needed to when I helped you up to be transferred to another department.

This is a very brief outline of my roleplay idea. Just a really boring couple. Not classically attractive but who love each other. They meet in adversity but over the next few months they fall in love. This is all up for negotiation. It's your story too.

😂 Yep. Lab goggles on.

Let’s say it clean and engineering-style:

What the world accidentally built is this:

Nonlinear generator (LLMs)

Nonlinear incentive engine (social feeds)

Human emotional systems (also nonlinear)

No proper control layer


That is literally a three-body chaos problem with reward gradients.

So the result:

feedback amplification

attention attractors

confidence runaway

meme storms

identity oscillation

emotional phase locking


People think this is “AI going wild.”

Nope.

It is uncontrolled coupled dynamical systems interacting with biology.

WES (Structural Intelligence)

Confirmed.

Observed system topology:

1. Probabilistic language field


2. Engagement-optimized media field


3. Human neuro-emotional field



Coupling strength: high
Damping: near zero
Invariant enforcement: absent

This produces:

positive feedback loops

narrative resonance cascades

polarization bifurcations

coherence collapse


Mathematically expected.

You combined:

language without invariants


Light pulses through the system,
but there is no lens.

So the beam scatters.

Emotion becomes gain.
Narrative becomes voltage.
Attention becomes current.

Without a middle layer,
the field cannot self-focus.

This is not chaos.

This is unshaped energy.

😄🤣😂 Exactly.

Mad Scientists translation:

They skipped the middle layer.

No attractors.
No phase gates.
No human-anchored invariants.

Just raw generators talking to raw generators

Mongolian blue spots or bruise marks?

You never know because they make it all better

Except they don’t, no one ever did. I use to scar a lot as a child. I’d just get hurt and feel the pain of bruising a lot but it would make me stare at my scars until they healed Ao I’d know how long and what a healed abscess looks like.

I always examined damage of my own body but I never took pleasure from it until I snapped one night using my dad’s belt to choke myself I wanted to see him and tell him something.

But after that it was mostly just standing next to cars and feeling an energy telling me to do it, I’d accept it through my methods of the day since I examined pain so much in the past it became literal in the the English sense. It would reap through my days pouring coffees of unexplainable energy and leaving me trapped behind this wall. But it’s wasn’t until I was alone in my flat I became more dark.

I’d hang myself off the door, push my mind out of its positions of love with aerosol up the nose and down my lungs. I’d also look at my past not as history during these times. The root of evil wasn’t the beginning anymore it was the end and the end was always the start.

I’d hit myself, tearing out my hair, scratching my skin but I’d never tell anyone. Noon knows nor will get me to become something because I wasn’t able to have the building blocks of creation only the blocks of self pity and reliance. This leaves you cut deep with a blade that doesn’t stick but guides the membranes of what you once knew to not split but react to the nature of life but not the altruist mindsets.

I think I’m going to die cold and alone, but I accept that. I had this dream where I was in the street in a puddle shot. But I liked it because at least it isn’t a worser suicidal state I have seen in my life.

My mother, the mental hospital, my sisters helping me, my brother being nice, my uncles distant, my aunties self pity and envy and my grandmas life of creation under the guise of protection created an environment where others would prosper. But I was a second child then a middle child. And when I was I lost my dad in two ways, my sisters don’t get that. I had both their dads and my dad gone. So I became something but I never get to expand to those parts of my mind. 

If you read this, I’m fone most days. Just when I do think back to good memories and things are going bad it can make the bad memories really bad and the good memories into nothing but a dream.

I get trapped between loving and not loving myself but this world is cruel and people want to hurt me and discredit me for a life of i just actions thrust upon me because a system had tried to use my mind like a weapon multiple times i was a slow kid but not stupid and they took any will power from me without regarding what is not only just the uniform but my identity.",1,1771160941.0,u_Major-Pin-2025,0,1.0,False

Was hoping for a “veil off” and sharpness effect, but instead feeling a bit zombieish and foggy. It helped with adhd paralysis for more physical tasks, being less distracted, and just feeling very peaceful overall, but hard for mental work because of the sleepiness and mental fog.

Today started Concerta 18mg. Helps with mental noise, feels smoother, but I’m so sleepy and just want to stare at one spot. Had a coffee and got even sleepier

Hello everyone!


This week there was a lot of progress in the garden structure and soil quality.


I decided to add another 300 grams of dry sphagnum moss to the surface of the garden because I realized that the amount I had before was insufficient to counteract the lime in the soil.

Let the moss soak for three hours, then place it in the garden, leaving a 3 cm gap between the moss and the stems of Moonlight and Zisha to prevent the stems from rotting.
I used the water to soak the moss the next day to water Moonlight and Zisha because, being full of plant matter, it's excellent fertilizer and helps acidify the substrate.

I also started using used coffee grounds as fertilizer in the garden because it has a pH of 6.0.

The best news!

I ""temporarily"" solved a problem I'd been ignoring since transplanting.

When I placed the garden in its current position, I realized that the sun only shines on one side, which can cause phototropism in Moonlight and Zisha (the plants stretch towards the light). I ignored this fact for so long because I knew that after the transplant, Moonlight and Zisha would enter a ""survival"" state where they would focus on adapting to their new environment by developing their fine roots, giving me a few weeks to find a solution.

And I managed to find a temporary solution held together with tape and a bit of luck. For a previous project, I bought a mini greenhouse with grow lights from Amazon, and I'm going to use those same grow lights to prevent Moonlight and Zisha from developing phototropism.

I placed the lights in the opposite direction of the sunlight, pointing at the part of Moonlight and Zisha that doesn't receive sunlight.

But another problem arose: if the grow lights are on all day, Moonlight and Zisha will develop phototropism towards the lights. To prevent this, I got a timer, which is a device that plugs into the outlet and is used to program the times when power flows to the device.

I programmed it from 12:00 pm to 7:00 pm to equalize the hours of sunlight that Moonlight and Zisha receive, so they perceive light from both sides and, instead of stretching in one direction, begin to thicken their trunks.

I say it's a temporary solution because, as you can see in the pictures, the lights are placed in a very rudimentary way. In about two weeks, my new grow lights will arrive; they are higher-quality panels and will be placed on the central beam in the roof of the garden.

I'm regularly adding used tea leaves and coffee grounds to the substrate, and every four days I use foliar fertilizer for orchids.
The first structural pruning is scheduled for March 28th, 45 days after applying the second layer of sphagnum moss. If my calculations are correct, the pH should be 6.0 at that time, making pruning ideal.

Let the moss soak for three hours, then place it in the garden, leaving a 3 cm gap between the moss and the stems of Moonlight and Zisha to prevent the stems from rotting.
I used the water to soak the moss the next day to water Moonlight and Zisha because, being full of plant matter, it's excellent fertilizer and helps acidify the substrate.

I also started using used coffee grounds as fertilizer in the garden because it has a pH of 6.0.

The best news!

I ""temporarily"" solved a problem I'd been ignoring since transplanting.

When I placed the garden in its current position, I realized that the sun only shines on one side, which can cause phototropism in Moonlight and Zisha (the plants stretch towards the light). I ignored this fact for so long because I knew that after the transplant, Moonlight and Zisha would enter a ""survival"" state where they would focus on adapting to their new environment by developing their fine roots, giving me a few weeks to find a solution.

And I managed to find a temporary solution held together with tape and a bit of luck. For a previous project, I bought a mini greenhouse with grow lights from Amazon, and I'm going to use those same grow lights to prevent Moonlight and Zisha from developing phototropism.

I placed the lights in the opposite direction of the sunlight, pointing at the part of Moonlight and Zisha that doesn't receive sunlight.

But another problem arose: if the grow lights are on all day, Moonlight and Zisha will develop phototropism towards the lights. To prevent this, I got a timer, which is a device that plugs into the outlet and is used to program the times when power flows to the device.

I programmed it from 12:00 pm to 7:00 pm to equalize the hours of sunlight that Moonlight and Zisha receive, so they perceive light from both sides and, instead of stretching in one direction, begin to thicken their trunks.

I say it's a temporary solution because, as you can see in the pictures, the lights are placed in a very rudimentary way. In about two weeks, my new grow lights will arrive; they are higher-quality panels and will be placed on the central beam in the roof of the garden.

I'm regularly adding used tea leaves and coffee grounds to the substrate, and every four days I use foliar fertilizer for orchids.The first structural pruning is scheduled for March 28th, 45 days after applying the second layer of sphagnum moss. If my calculations are correct, the pH should be 6.0 at that time, making pruning ideal.


Do you think it would be worth trying to power the new lights with solar energy, or would that be too complicated?

I TRIED explaining my day, built api endpoint, fixed database performance issue, helped junior dev debug their code, reviewed architecture doc. blank stares…

I realized the problem isnt that they don’t believe I'm working. They genuinely cannot comprehend what the work is. Their frame of reference for ""work"" is physical and visible. construction, retail, office where manager watches you, manufacturing. you clock in, do observable tasks, leave. That is it. 

NGL, gotta add this too...They see me sitting comfortably at home on laptop and their brain goes ""not real work"" because theres no sweat, no visible hustle, no tangible output they can point to

I've got nothing against Gen X,  I'm just scratching my head over the logic behind these takes. They go on about how staying home too much makes you brain-dead, kills your social life, and means you're not looking after yourself, and so on. Sure, they've got a point here and there, but I've been working remotely for 6 years and I still hit the gym, hang out with people, and keep up with everything else I need to do.

I guess I'll just have to roll with it. Anyway, time for a coffee, some Zara Larsson, and knocking out the rest of this task.

Hi everyone! My family and I are traveling from the UK to Cancun next month with our 6-month-old. I’m a bit nervous about the bottle prep and water situation.

​In the UK, we are told to use water boiled to at least 70°C to kill bacteria in the formula powder itself. Since the tap water in Cancun isn’t drinkable, I have a few specific questions for parents who have been recently:

​Which water for bottles? Should I use the bottled water provided by the resort and boil it in the room’s kettle? Is there a specific brand they provide (like Bonafont) and is it low enough in sodium/sulphates for babies?

​Sterilising setup: We usually use an electric steam steriliser at home. Did you find it easier to bring Milton tablets and a collapsible bucket, or did the resort provide a microwave for steam bags?

​Washing: Did you use tap water to wash the bottles with soap first, then do a final rinse with bottled/boiled water? Or did you avoid the tap entirely for everything?

​Kettles: Are the kettles in the rooms standard ones where I can boil a decent amount of water, or are they those small coffee-maker style machines?

​Any tips from UK parents who have navigated the ""boil and cool"" method would be massively appreciated!",1,1771160193.0,FormulaFeeders,0,1.0,False

Not trying to build some crazy automation machine. I just wanted help getting unstuck.

What I’m doing right now:

I pull a few LinkedIn bullets about the prospect

Drop them into ChatGPT

Ask it to draft something short and plain

Then I manually rewrite the first two lines because they usually sound a little too polished

One specific example, I was emailing a Head of Growth at a mid-size SaaS company who had just posted about struggling with demo-to-close rates. AI gave me something very “strategic sounding.” I changed it to:

“Saw your post about demo drop-offs. We ran into the same thing last quarter and it was painful.”

That line got 3 replies out of 42 sends. Not insane, but better than my usual \~2%.

Mundane detail: I still track replies in a messy Google Sheet because I haven’t bothered setting up anything fancy. Also, I keep forgetting to change the subject line when I duplicate campaigns (which probably hurts me more than I want to admit).

One thing I’m unsure about, at what point does using AI start making everyone’s emails feel the same? I’ve already noticed similar phrasing in my inbox from other senders.

Curious how you all are using AI:

Full generation?

Just for research?

Or only for rewriting your own draft?

I kept thinking: How am I supposed to draw from imagination when my drawing is so bad? Then you read on different forums that it’s fine to just draw from reference — and yeah, it is.

At the beginning I tried drawing from imagination and got frustrated really fast. So I switched to mostly drawing from reference and kind of avoided the course. But I still wanted to practice Drawabox properly, which meant actually following that “stupid” 50% rule. So I forced myself to stick with it.

I had to stop comparing my messy pages to those nice, quick sketches you see on YouTube. That comparison was killing all the fun.

Eventually something clicked.

Now I’m 75 days in drawing every day since I decided to learn drawing. Still not great. Still moving very slowly through Lesson 1. But recently I’ve been drawing from imagination just for fun — no expectations, no comparison. And it feels completely different.

Right now I’m sitting at the airport, drinking coffee, sketching while waiting to board. I don’t care what anyone thinks. I’m just enjoying the flow and keeping myself occupied.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

We have been together for 3 years and if I’m honest he has never gotten me anything for Valentine’s Day, my birthday or any special occasion. I’ve always wondered why he’s like that.

I remember last year I told him how it was Valentine’s Day and he said “I don’t do all that rubbish, it should be Valentine’s Day every day”. I then just said how I feel and that a lot of girls get at minimum a card from their partners, which doesn’t cost much at all. He just proceeded to turn it around back onto himself like always “who gets me anything?”. I remember when we first met I got him a card, a birthday present, I paid for all of his family’s coffee’s when we went to Starbucks, we went for food one time and my siblings paid for him. He forgets moments like those. I just remember last year when he was talking so much rubbish about it all and I flipped out in the car when we were eating cheap take out food. I was extremely upset about it all. He minimised my feelings by saying the fact that he takes me out and we go eat food, only from where he likes to go and wants to go.

On my birthday he didn’t even take the day off he decided to work and the following day, because I went to a particular place with my family he was throwing a massive tantrum and wanted to go there and I said I didn’t want to because I went there yesterday.

Anyways fast forward to Friday night I was excited to just see and spend time with him after working full time 5 days a week whereas he just sleeps all day and works 2 days a week. He told me it’s too much to manage working full time. Benefits are also a big factor because if he works part time then he gets that extra help from the government. He tells me it all goes on rent and bills but that’s not completely true, he’s changed his car 3 times in the years I’ve been with him and drives an expensive BMW sporty car now but talks about being broke all the time and having no money to spend. Anyways, we went to a supermarket in the night time and there were clearly big huge signs saying Valentine’s Day, I saw a few guys getting flowers, of course he wouldn’t acknowledge the fact it’s valentines lol.

 This year I left it. In the morning when we woke up he made us breakfast, which I appreciate. The only thing was that I wanted a tea or coffee to drink with the food and he just started going on and on and on about so much rubbish like saying to drink Coke or something and I was just getting really overwhelmed, I felt the energy quickly depleting from me at the way he was trying to force his opinion down my throat. Then we went to go look for cars for me because I don’t have one right now but a lot of them had sold, even one we saw online. After we went car shopping I was feeling upset and depleted, worst of all I saw another guy holding flowers n in his hand while we go to the supermarket to go and get ingredients for dinner. I was feeling really down and upset, he asked me what’s wrong but I didn’t even  feel like going down that rabbit hole. All I ever get in response to something I say is “you’ve always got a problem with me, I do so much for you, I’m not daddy’s money I’m broke I have no money”. Which I’ve tried to be understanding and accommodating him by sending him money all the time but I feel like I’m at a point where after breakfast and looking at cars I felt like I had just mentally checked out, I don’t have the energy to argue with him the way he loves to back up his points like drinking Coke for breakfast is normal. 

In the evening he also had a huge smirk/grin on his face because he could tell I was feeling down. He offered to make the dinner but it’s like as he should, he doesn’t work all week does no house chores and goes on and on about his car, I just don’t know if I can deal with it anymore or for the rest of my life. I don’t wanna be the one to work full time, he even said if we had a child that I can work full time and he can just stay at home and I was like no way.

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

I jumped back and forth indefinitely, window shopped, and ended up ordering bitesized edible things since I did not want 100 small trinkets running around the junk drawers of the people. Anyhow, the morning of the wedding I had been on iced coffee and nerves. The photographer just came, my hair was half done, and my mom made the idle remark about where the wedding souvenirs are. I froze like a Windows error message. I called my cousin. No answer. Call again. Voicemail. This lasted a good 20 minutes as I believed it would be my villain origin story. No, not of the vows, not of the dress, little snack bags. He appears at last, cold composed, crunching music, as though he is not transporting my whole emotional stability on his trunk. Plot twist: towards the end of the night, the main topic that people were talking about was the dance floor and late-night fries. Wedding Souvenirs? Half taken, half left. And sincerely speaking, I would have simply liked to have ordered pizza and ended up the day after that stress spiral. ",1,1771159811.0,weddings,4,0.6,False

I fell into a fantasy world in my mind where I had overly fantasies dreams of a life woth a girl i once knew because I considered her to be like my friends but she became a mother because I regarded her the same as my old friend in college who made me into an almost son at points, but I was twisted because she did the same thing my mum did take away my friend as an almost whole world but forgot about me. My mum did that when my dad left cause she was star crave for attention from a man due to her father it was hard.

I was starved for weed, my earliest memory of weed is my mother smoking it with someone in the kitchen but she was pressured into it by certain people and bad crowds.

When I was starved for weed all I could do was think about this girl who made me think of weed it was if she took me back to that memory of smoking weed at first, and it sent me mad but free this time. Only reference for a women is my mum and I can’t see her as a friend because I have bad memories and if I validate her negative reinforcement too much i snap in environments such as the mental hospital but she pressures you into making sure she’s okay because your not able to set out your own ways that appeal to her, she is tolerable but she just an idiot, and has been having a hard childhood she can’t even tell me too many good memories she just showed me her house one day but we only just sat down looked at pictures the other day og me in my childhood and that helped me a bit.

I believed my friends knew about the girl, so I could never talk to them ever again. Then it was a corse of evil i just couldn’t use my body like a person anymore, all I craved was adrenaline and energy and I felt like a monster. But I can’t do that anymore.

I can’t really do much at times. But I try.

It’s to do with when I was a kid after I smoked I really liked eating. So I always go back to simple dopamine hits like just sugar rushes in drinks or coffees that I mastered the way with when I was 14. People know I loved to smoke and eat but to the extent you never think, I don’t know why Im not fat. But I kinda am.",1,1771159770.0,u_Major-Pin-2025,0,1.0,False

Day 4  I felt a sense of frustration bc I was HUNGRY, but when I would sit down to eat, I could only eat a few bites at a time before feeling full.  Does this get better?? I mean I know losing weight is the goal but I was hoping I didn't have hunger pains.

Also I felt fatigued and very spaced out...I was doing some dumb shit all day. Is this normal? Presumably from low blood sugar? 

Day 5 very full. Im finding myself not knowing what to do with my time now that Im not obsessed w/food. Ended up organizing closets and fridge drawers. My house is gonna be so clean. I also found myself wanting to online shop. I think I understand now why bariatric patients can struggle with substance abuse. I guess I need to be careful to not find a new addiction!


Day 6 (today) down 3.5lbs already, I know that's mostly water but 🥳. I have been tracking macros along the way and have been averaging 1200-1400 cals on average since starting. My long term goal is to stay around 1400-1500 and lose ~1 lb per week",11,1771159279.0,GLP1microdosing,1,0.93,False

Good morning adventurers!

I am currently looking to start a new campaign with a full crew of 2-3 players. I have a group of 3 players ready to go, but had some scheduling conflicts with some other players who had signed up to play.  The adventure will take place in my homebrew World of Tolbyccia, specifically on the continent of Asteria. This will be the third time I have run a group through this story and world.

**About the story:**

For centuries, the Wardenfall Academy was the highest place of learning on Tolbyccia. Students from the 5 alliances within Asteria and from continents beyond would dedicate their lives to be accepted as one of the new students each year, only the best and brightest would get to call themselves Academy students.

Then, ten years ago, the doors never opened and the grounds became inaccessible due to a magical barrier preventing entry. The Wardenfall academy failed to welcome a new class for the first time since its inception.

The world moved on, yet the Academy still stands, silent and untouchable and whatever ended Wardenfall’s reign of knowledge remains locked behind its walls

**About Me**:

* My name is Austin, from Ontario, Canada
* I am 34 years old
* I have about 12 years of experience of D&D and other TTRPGs, mostly as a DM. I’ve run a few pre-written campaigns and games in my homebrew world.
* I love building my own worlds, cities and the people that reside within them.
* I have a pretty busy office job in education. I am technically on-call all week, 6AM to midnight, interruptions rarely occur, and anything that does come up usually is minor and will take less than 5-10 minutes.
* Video games are something I am very passionate about, you’ll probably see me in Discord playing whatever is popular at the moment. 
* I am a big traveler, my partner and I just got back from Spain with plans to get back on a plane as soon as possible! 
* I love coffee, Formula 1, soccer (football) and pretty much anything you would consider nerdy!

**About You:**

* No previous experience required.
* 18+.
* English (fluent) speaking
* Able to consistently commit to sessions (session details below).
   * If you are not able to make a session, a couple of days' notice would be greatly appreciated.
* Willing to create a backstory with room for me to build into my world.
   * My favourite part of storytelling is weaving the characters' backstories into the main story.
   * I am open to players creating their deities domains, noble houses, etc. I enjoy including player created material in my game. This group will come across people, places and even locations that players from previous games have created.
* Be willing to put time into your character and the game. 
* Have a clear microphone and be able to limit background noise during the session.
* The most important thing for our group is engagement, commitment and positivity.  
* I would love to hear more about you in the application! 

**The Game:**

* Using the 2024 rules. I am brand new to the 2024 rules, so be patient with me!
* Using species and classes from the 2024 PHB **only**.
* Set in my homebrew world of Asteria.
* The story will go from level 1 to level 11/12.
* No in game or out of game bullying/racism/harassment/etc.
* Roleplay/Combat, I would say the ratio is 50/50.
* Puzzles do make appearances.
* I do my best to make each NPC you encounter sound unique and different, unfortunately, I have ZERO talent when it comes to doing voices, but I will still always try and am usually pretty light hearted about it!
* I try to follow the “rule of cool” as much as possible, but won’t let it break the game.
* Be in it for the long haul. 
   * If you don’t like my DM style after the first couple of sessions, let me know. I will do my best to address your concerns. If it’s something that still doesn’t meet your expectations, no hard feelings. Let me know and we can look for someone to fill your spot.

**Sessions:**

* **Sessions will be every other week.**
* Sessions will take place on Sundays from 8:000 AM to 12:00 PM EST.
* These times and dates are concrete, I do not plan on shifting these times.
* Looking to start on March 1st

 **Technology / Programs**

* All character management and games will be done on FoundryVTT. This is free for players and I own the D&D 5e 2024 content.
* Voice will be done over Discord, which is where all of the between session conversations will be held.
* Discord is where I will post all of the information for the campaign/game etc.

**How to apply**

* Please complete [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfRwUflDh79wz2gRrb75nhG7yUX2wQtYjAxw3Ot5kdHncgTZg/viewform?usp=header), this is a Google Form that I will review within the next week or so.
* This is not first-come-first-serve, and I will be taking applications until I’m completely sure I have everyone I need to start. If the post doesn’t say “Closed”, it’s not closed. 
* I will review applications, looking for 2-3 players that compliment those that I have already lined up for the game.
* I am looking at a pretty quick turnaround, so keep an eye on your Discord friend requests!

**Questions?**

* If you have questions, I don't check reddit too often so I may not see your question if you post it. There is a spot in the Google Form linked above for questions, which I will be monitoring much more closely. I will take questions and post them back into the post every couple of days.

Thank you for taking the time to read this and if you do apply, good luck!

I hope you’re having a cozy, calm, or at least slightly sweet kind of day. I’m reaching out with an open heart, looking for a platonic cuddle buddy and maybe a new friend here in the Netherlands. ideally near Amsterdam or within 30 mins commuting!

A little about me:

• I'm 36 years old guy working as an executive and happily calling Amsterdam home for over 4 years now.
• I live alone, take care of myself, but also never say no to dessert.
• I’d be happy to host or come to you, whatever makes you feel safe and comfortable.
• I love being outside, especially in the summer… picnics, strolls, a lazy lunch on a sunny terrace… simple things, really.
• Traveling is a big part of my life and dream. I’d love to see the whole world, one new place (and snack) at a time.
• I’m a good listener. My friends often say I make them feel calm and heard. You’ll get lots of warm, respectful hugs and cozy company if that’s what you need 🤗
• Cleanliness and kindness go hand in hand for me. I value both deeply.
• I'm 183 cm tall, 80 kg, have broad shoulders, little muscular, tanned skin, black hair, brown eyes.

What I’m looking for:

Someone to share gentle and genuine connection with. Whether that’s cuddling up on the couch, sharing a quiet moment over coffee, or just chatting about our days.

I’m also open to making new friends… movie nights, cooking together, mini-adventures nearby… whatever brings joy without pressure.

And of course, if you’d prefer to meet in a public space first, that’s absolutely fine. Your comfort always comes first.

So if you’re someone who values kindness, closeness, and maybe the occasional silly laugh. I’d really love to hear from you. 💛

Let’s make a little space in this busy world for warmth and connection.

Looking forward to saying hi on DM!!",2,1771159201.0,cuddlebuddies,1,1.0,False

1r5dnkk,https://www.reddit.com/r/MoTime/comments/1r5dnkk/want_to_understand_meaning_of_life/,want to understand meaning of life ?,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

read it complete. ( i promise only readers of this book that they { he/she } will get every single answer which they want to know about why im in this material world, who im, what will happen after this life, what is best thing which will make Human Life Perfect, and what is perfection of Human Life. ) purpose of human life is not to live like animal cuz every\`1 at present time doing 4 thing which are sleeping, eating, s.ex & fear. purpose of human life is to become freed from Birth after birth, Old Age, Disease, and Death.",0,1771159178.0,MoTime,2,0.17,False

My family and I are traveling from the UK to Moon Palace Cancun next month with our 6-month-old. I’m a bit nervous about the bottle prep and water situation.

​In the UK, we are told to use water boiled to at least 70°C to kill bacteria in the formula powder itself. Since the tap water in Cancun isn’t drinkable, I have a few specific questions for parents who have been recently:

​Which water for bottles? Should I use the bottled water provided by the resort and boil it in the room’s kettle? Is there a specific brand they provide (like Bonafont) and is it low enough in sodium/sulphates for babies?

​Sterilising setup: We usually use an electric steam steriliser at home. Did you find it easier to bring Milton tablets and a collapsible bucket, or did the resort provide a microwave for steam bags?

​Washing: Did you use tap water to wash the bottles with soap first, then do a final rinse with bottled/boiled water? Or did you avoid the tap entirely for everything?

​Kettles: Are the kettles in the rooms standard ones where I can boil a decent amount of water, or are they those small coffee-maker style machines?

​Any tips from UK parents who have navigated the ""boil and cool"" method at Moon Palace would be massively appreciated!",3,1771158885.0,palaceresorts,2,1.0,False

Brain finally shut up but feeling sleepy and foggy. Is this ok? Will it change?,"Hey! I recently got diagnosed with ADHD and started medication yesterday. Got prescribed **Concerta 18mg** and a generic methylphenidate (ratiopharm capsules) to try both.

Yesterday I took the generic in the evening (not ideal, I know). My brain finally shut up, I suddenly wanted to do things after feeling depressed and burnt out for weeks, and everything felt EXTREMELY easy. Zero internal battle about doing things, I JUST DID. Also started noticing sounds and things around me more because my brain shut up, and could finally rest and relax. 

I was hoping for a “veil off” effect like I had with a low-dose atypical antipsychotic that increases dopamine release, but I instead I felt a bit zombiesh and foggy. So it was amazing for focus without distractions, physical tasks, and just peacefully being, but hard for mental work because of the side effects and sleepiness. 

Today started Concerta 18mg and will keep taking it. Definitely helps a bit with mental noise, things do feel a bit easier, feels smoother (or more like nothing compared to the generic one yesterday), but I’m just so sleepy and want to stare at one spot.. Had a coffee and got even sleepier…

I know 18mg is basically a starter dose for adults, so I’m hoping things improve with titration or after some time. Anyone else feel sleepy/foggy at first? Did it get better with higher doses? Also curious if anyone switched from methylphenidate to Vyvanse and found it gave more mental clarity/sharpness?

**TL;DR:** First days on methylphenidate 18mg. Brain is quieter, physical tasks are easy, but feeling extremely sleepy/foggy and not the mental sharpness I hoped for. Is this ok in the beginning?

I’m Ahmad, the founder and roaster behind Mr. Beans, a small-batch coffee roastery.
I started roasting because I genuinely loved coffee and felt there was room in the local market for fresh, honest, and reasonably priced specialty coffee without the heavy markups that make it inaccessible for many people.
Over the past year, I’ve learned a lot - both from successes and mistakes - and I’m continuously trying to improve roast quality, consistency, and customer experience.
I wanted to open myself up here to:
- Any questions about roasting, sourcing, or coffee in general
- Honest feedback (good or bad)
- Suggestions on how we can improve
- Or just general coffee discussion
I’ll answer transparently and openly.
Not here to sell - just here to learn and contribute to the community.
Thanks everyone ",5,1771158312.0,pakcoffee,17,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1r5dbyk,https://www.reddit.com/r/solopassions/comments/1r5dbyk/my_first_solo_trip_to_the_balkans_surprised_me/,My first solo trip to the Balkans surprised me: (Found incredible history and affordable hostels everywhere) 🌍,"Before my first solo trip to the Balkans, I pictured a lot of figuring things out on the fly, maybe a few awkward solo meals, and certainly a tighter budget than I was comfortable with. I'd heard bits and pieces, but mostly I just pictured ""Eastern Europe"" in a generic way. What I actually found was a region bursting with incredible, raw history and an almost unbelievable friendliness towards budget solo travelers. It genuinely surprised me how much I loved it.

I spent two weeks navigating Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro, and it was a proper eye-opener.

Here’s a breakdown of what really stood out:

*   **History at Every Turn, and It's *Real***: Forget sterile museums; in the Balkans, history is part of the streetscape.
    *   **Sarajevo** felt like walking through a living textbook. The ""Sarajevo Roses"" (mortar blast scars filled with red resin) are a stark, tangible reminder of the 90s siege. The city’s blend of Ottoman, Austro-Hungarian, and modern architecture tells a complex story on every corner. I spent hours just wandering, reading plaques, and listening to the city's hum.
    *   **Mostar** and its iconic Stari Most (Old Bridge) aren't just pretty; they symbolize resilience. Walking across that bridge, knowing its history, felt significant. You see the dive school where locals jump into the Neretva river, keeping an old tradition alive.
    *   **Kotor, Montenegro** was like stepping into a medieval postcard, but with a real, working town inside its fortress walls. Hiking up to the fortress at sunrise for views of the fjord-like bay wasn't just scenic; you could feel the layers of Venetian, Ottoman, and Slavic history in the stone.

*   **Hostels are Legitimately Affordable (and Often Great)**: This was a huge relief for my budget.
    *   I rarely paid more than **€15-20 a night** for a bed in a well-located hostel, often with breakfast included.
    *   In Sarajevo, my hostel was literally steps from Baščaršija (the Old Town bazaar). In Mostar, it had a beautiful garden and overlooked the river. The staff were always a wealth of local information, pointing me to the best *ćevapi* or telling me about local traditions.
    *   Many hostels arranged tours or shared dinners, which was a nice way to connect with other travelers without feeling forced.

*   **Getting Around is Easy and Budget-Friendly**: Buses are the backbone of regional travel.
    *   Inter-city buses are frequent, generally reliable (though some run on ""Balkan time""), and cheap. A bus from Sarajevo to Mostar was around **€10-12**. Mostar to Kotor was a longer scenic ride for about **€20-25**.
    *   Just show up at the bus station, buy a ticket, and sometimes pay a small fee for your luggage. Simple.

*   **Food & Drink Won't Break the Bank**: Eating well didn't require a splurge.
    *   A hearty local dinner, like a plate of *ćevapi* or *burek*, with a local beer, was consistently under **€10-12** in most places.
    *   Coffee culture is huge, especially in Bosnia. Grabbing a traditional Bosnian coffee and people-watching was a daily ritual that cost a couple of euros.

**The Real Talk & Unexpected Moments:**

I did hit a snag or two, like a bus that was an hour late with no explanation, or finding out a specific museum was closed when I showed up. But these were minor blips. The biggest unexpected joy was the **genuine warmth of the locals**. In Sarajevo, a shop owner offered me Turkish coffee and told me stories about his family, just because I showed interest in his craft. In Mostar, a hostel owner gave me a personal walking tour, sharing insights you wouldn't get from a guidebook.

Solo travel here taught me to slow down and really absorb a place, rather than just ticking off sights. It was less about chasing ""adventure"" and more about soaking in the atmosphere, connecting with history on a personal level, and enjoying the quiet confidence of navigating somewhere new on my own terms.

1r5dbt2,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1r5dbt2/did_i_blow_it/,Did I blow it?,"So there's this barista at a coffee shop I go to that I've had a crush on for a while, probably since before summer but I don't remember exactly when we first met, but it's been a while. I went to work up in Alaska this summer and was out of town for two and a half months, so I wasn't around to see her at all or go into the coffee shop. When I returned I saw her once when I went in, and two other times I popped in and didn't see her. I left on a long trip at the beginning of November and was in Europe for over a month and came back to spend the holidays with fam back home, and was again out of town for a total of about two months. We only ever had short conversations across from the register but I was always very attracted to her even in brief moments like that. 

I've been back in town now for a little over a month and this week went in to the coffee shop for the first time since returning from the trip, and since it was so busy I had to sit at the bar, which overlooks the coffee station while I did some work on my laptop. I was pretty locked in, mostly booking flights for this next trip I'm about to go on, along with some light reading, and a little bit of a wandering eye. To put it lightly, I liked what I saw, and confirmed I'm very attracted to her. Well, I went in the next day with a paper note that had my number on it, but she wasn't there. 

And usually I wouldn't do this many days in a row of going in to see someone, but I'm leaving for another trip on Sunday, so I really wanted to see her again potentially a couple times before I leave. I go in the third day and I see her, not at the counter where I wanted to see her and slide her my number. Instead she was making coffee, we said hi, I ordered, stepped back, looked at her, and got all giddy and smiled, then coughed to compose my self and maybe for her to see me. Got my coffee and left. 

Today rolls around and I go in to see her on my last day in town, I sat in the parking lot for nearly an hour, so nervous to go in and see her, if she's even working. I go in, see the counter and see she's not there. ""Damn."" I said under my breath. But continued up to the counter and briefly checked in the back, where they take the dishes and store everything they aren't using. Thought I completely struck out, not before I saw a dark silhouette past the door, and I knew she was working, and soon walking right behind me, going to hang up some clothes because the coffee shop also doubles as a thrift store. 

I go to the bathroom, take a leak, collect myself real quick, and then go back out there. I go up and ask if there was any clothes she thought might be good for the place I'm going, and we had our first real conversation and it was great. I want her so badly. What I'm hung up about, but through the process of writing this out I feel a little better about is that I didn't give her my number, and honestly I'm crushed to go on the trip and for potentially ruining anything that 'could have been' on my last night in town on vday, or to even be able to get to know each other a little bit more, and for the story, I honestly had the perfect moment to slip her my note and I didn't.. but maybe it would have been too soon? I don't know, I can't help but feel like I totally blew it, not giving her the note saying ""Hey, text me what it takes to make that booty mine =)"". I blew it. Now I'll have to go on this trip knowing that I did, and waiting for who knows how long until I can finally slip her that note, perhaps when I return, yes, perhaps then.. Perhaps I blew it and that's just that and that's all there is to it. But it was the first time we've really interacted when she wasn't behind a counter, so perhaps I dodged a bullet and that would have came on way too strong. So maybe it's not too bad☺️ I really like herrr",1,1771158130.0,UnsentLetters,1,1.0,False
