1plxh3y,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1plxh3y,TPU nylon bike frame bag,"This is a reply to a post from yesterday. 

I've been a big fan of TPU nylon for projects since I got my first DIYpackraft. Partially because of all the scrap material that comes with that kit, mixed with the price of lightweight waterproof bags for various other sports- this project was a no brainer to make. Took me 1 afternoon to create and install.

Tizip style zipper from Amazon was 18$. The rest are scraps from my first packraft kit (see other posts in my profile to see my 3rd and final packraft, it's truly a work of art). I used a hot leather iron and a hot air gun, which is typically used for electronics, to create this bike frame bag. Velcro straps were bootied from other projects and the Fairbanks transfer site.

It is not 100% waterproof, as in if I submerged the bike my stuff would get wet. This is due to the holes I punched that match the water bottle holder frame nuts... You can sorta see the white water bottle holder on the pic inside the bag. Prior to putting these holes it was entirely waterproof!This holds my coffee thermos in place well for my morning commute. I also keep a few tools, bike lock and lunch all typically fit.

I've got backpacks, packraft bow bags, bike frame bags, and more dry bags than I can count from these scraps. In case you're scared to pull the trigger, DIYpackraft kit pays for itself!",1,1765663787.0,myog,0,1.0,False

1plxenx,https://www.reddit.com/r/migraine/comments/1plxenx/after_20_years_with_migraine_9_lessons_i_wish_i/,After 20 years with migraine: 9 lessons I wish I knew when I was diagnosed,"I have lived with migraine for more than 20 years. But I made many mistakes that worsened my health over the years. That is why I am sharing these points. They are things I wish I had known when it all started and I believe they can help anyone living with migraine.

1. Migraine is not just the pain of the attack. That is the visible part. In reality, it is a complex neurovascular condition. It starts in the brain and alters processes that also affect blood vessels. People with migraine have a higher risk of cardiovascular diseases, visual disturbances, mood disorders, sleep problems, epilepsy, and in some cases cognitive decline. This is why medical follow-up is important even when attacks seem under control.

2. Focus on preventive treatment, not just treating the pain. Do not get discouraged if you have tried 4, 7, or even 10 preventives and none worked. That does not mean there are no more options. There are many different treatments and it is always worth trying. Insist with your doctor until you find something that reduces the frequency or severity of your attacks. Sometimes a medication that did not work years ago works today.

3. Your daily habits do matter.

Sleeping well, managing stress, what you eat, and screen time do not cure migraine, but they can make a big difference. This is very personal, and everyone discovers over time what affects them and what does not.

4. Hydration matters more than you might think.

Drinking enough water can help reduce attacks. Being dehydrated can make them more likely to happen.

5. Having a good neurologist and real follow-up makes a big difference.

If they are a headache specialist, even better. Having a professional who listens, adjusts treatment, and does not give up on you can make a huge difference in the long term.

6. If you are a woman, hormones matter.

Menstruation and menopause clearly influence migraine. Many doctors overlook this, so it is important to be aware of it and discuss it with your doctor.

7. Take your rescue medication as soon as symptoms start.

We have all waited to see if it goes away on its own. Sometimes it does, but often it does not. The longer you wait to take medication, the harder it is to stop the attack. Taking it early can save you suffering and reduce the impact on your body and brain.

8. Keep a migraine diary.

You can use an app (I use Migraine Buddy, but there are many). Do not rely only on your memory, our recollections can be inaccurate and malleable. Record each attack, rate its severity, note start and end times, rescue medication used, and duration. Record triggers, whether you slept well that day, drank coffee, drank enough water, and other factors. Reviewing years of data can give you key insights for yourself and your doctor.

9. Last but not least, go to therapy.

Find a good therapist. Psychotherapy, especially approaches like cognitive behavioral therapy, has been shown to help reduce the frequency and impact of migraine attacks. People with migraine are at higher risk for anxiety and depression, and addressing these factors improves migraine management. Even if you do not have a mental health diagnosis, therapy can help you manage stress, pain, and the emotional burden of living with migraine.",1,1765663603.0,migraine,0,1.0,False
1plxel4,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption2/comments/1plxel4/i_used_to_hate_the_slow_walking_in_camp_now_i/,I used to hate the slow walking in Camp. Now I realize it might be the most important mechanic in the game.,"I’ve been playing a lot RDR2 recently, and I just realised something that was completely missing.

You know that feeling when you wake up in camp, and your finger instinctively hammers the ""Shift"" key, expecting Arthur to sprint? But he doesn't. Instead of running, he lumbers slowly. He walks, greeting other people, pouring coffee, just... existing.

At first, I hated it. I thought it was clunky design. I caught myself thinking: Why am I forced to walk slowly when I need to rush to the next quest, the next robbery? I would impatiently wait for Arthur to reach his horse just so I could gallop away at full speed.

But the more time I spent in walking through the camp, the more I started to appreciate this subtle friction.

The game forces you to stop performing. It forces you to stop optimizing your time. It invites you to just sit by the fire, clean your gun, or watch the sunrise over the Heartlands. In a real world where everything is about ""hustle"" and notifications and speed, the ""forced slowness"" of RDR2 actually started to feel like a sanctuary for me.

It’s not bad design. It’s permission to breathe.

I wrote a longer reflection on how RDR2 helps with the anxiety of modern life (and why Arthur is the perfect teacher for slowing down). If you're interested, you can read it here (no paywall):

1plx9z0,https://www.reddit.com/r/valzubiriagenda/comments/1plx9z0/what_is_valzubiriagenda_and_some_ideas_and/,What is #VALZUBIRIAGENDA and some ideas and insights,"# The 3 basic parameters of hashtag #Valzubiriagenda:

1. **We artists and everyone else can write and self-publish art- and artist-related books: memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs.** Books are forever. Pamphlets and brochures are not books.
2. **We announce a schedule of increasing prices of our art pieces,** which includes quantities (scarcity numbers) per price point and overall (the total quantity of art pieces we might ever make). This helps art traders, art investors and art collectors speculate or even stop speculating and instead join a community of investors working together to hopefully skyrocket to the higher announced prices in a shorter span of time.
3. **We can use the NFT world, because NFTs provide the tracking (who owns what) and trading.**

We can also not be involved with NFTs. Stores and individuals can help sell art using online presence and our catalogs in the stores. If this trends, or once this trends, even expensive art can be sold by neighboring businesses, without exclusivity. Commission systems do not have to be standardized. Art investors can produce their own catalogs to leave at the cafés. Even the cafés can produce their own catalogs.

**Valzubiriagenda NFTs**

**NFTs only came about a few years ago.** But I had been working on this since the 1990s. I wrote a book, **Valzubiriagenda**, along with fellow artist **Silverio Perez,** and released it in 2018 (Amazon and elsewhere), tackling everything related to #1 & #2. We'll come up with #3 in a later book/ memoir/ marketing book.

Any artist, including tangible artists can release 10,000 NFTs if the artist chooses to do so. For tangible artists, the NFT first becomes an Art Commission Contract for sight unseen, yet-to-be made art. Once the art is made, the NFT becomes proof of ownership that the actual, tangible art is theirs.

**Warehousing our tangible art**

Another related idea is that the tangible art may be warehoused by the artist so that the NFT traders continue to trade. This means that even 10-ton 10-foot tall sculptures can be owned and traded by anyone without worrying about shipping, reshipping, scratches, smudges, parts breaking off, etc. The newness of the pieces remain because they are stored by the artist, source, gallery, etc. The art piece gets shipped to the art collector, the ultimate owner.

An artist who makes ceramic coffee mugs - smaller art pieces, can release 10,000 NFTs with a schedule of increasing prices so that NFT traders can trade immediately. The 10,000 coffee mugs can get damaged, so as they are made, they continue to be stored by the artist, until the time when art collectors decide to have the art pieces shipped to them.

**Why only now?**

I decided to write as many book-length memoirs as I can before I came out to promote this.

I'm an artist and an author. Both need time to ""master."" I would not even fully use ""master"" on myself, because there's always something new, even to my own art, my own writing and publishing.

>*I am now claiming that I'm the visual artist who has produced the most artist memoirs in the world.* I have 5 on Amazon. I count **Valzubiriagenda** as both a marketing book and a memoir-of-sorts, because it has a lot of my own life lessons on writing and publishing. I would not care to contest my claim of having the most memoirs. I will release 5 more over the next 3 years.

**BARTER! Get help to write, photograph art and publish your books!**

Anyone can hire 11 ghostwriters for 11 memoirs. If you can make art, but you cannot write, then barter your forever art with those who can help you produce forever books.

I don't feel the pressure of writing and publishing because I feel my focus should be on art students and art experts who would study my art and my books 100 years from now. Don't expect relatives and friends to read your books.

**I call myself the Dollman**

For my NFTs, I am proposing to make dioramas - my original, costumed, bejeweled porcelain dolls in backdrops that will also have precious metals and gemstones. This way I can incorporate precious metals and gemstones in my work, to make sure that people perceive my art as expensive, just in case I myself don't become ""famous"" - there's no need to get world famous. We are artists and all we need to do is to satisfy the art niche.

**Use your laptop now!**

I will encourage you to start writing your book-length memoir. Write, Edit and then Self-publish it. Get help. Why wait a hundred years for someone to write about you when all you need is a laptop and a nearby coffee shop.

Don't start counting chickens before the eggs hatch. I have encountered a lot of would-be writers who immediately see themselves as bestselling. world famous assets to society. Two even wanted me to sign NDAs (Nondisclosure agreements), because they did not want me to steal their book ideas.

Here's a suggestion. I would not personally do it. From one manuscript can come 2 books: The Original Draft (unedited, with misspellings, considered to be an art piece, scanned pages(?) of your handwritten original effort), and The Final Edition (edited).

**PROVENANCE!**

Another way to enhance our investability, tradability and collectability is **PROVENANCE** ***- how art ownership proceeds through time.*** The way this can be done is also through publishing books. Everyone can write their memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs, including traders, investors and art collectors. In effect, we artists can continue to be included or mentioned in even more books, without any additional effort by us.

You as an investor, reseller, trader, art collector should be able to publish a catalog with 250 works by 250 different artists, but they need to agree to this right from the start - it's your money, you should require them to follow your version of the hashtag ***#valzubiriagenda*** *parameters,* which preferably should include permission for you to publish their art. Why would you track down 250 artists later?

**No exclusive contracts**

If you're a café, you can call for artists, and come up with a book with for example, 30 artists, with a chapter devoted to each artist's profile and images of the artist's art.

You can distribute your catalogs to businesses and individuals near and far and online.

The book **Valzubiriagenda** even cites that funeral homes and janitors closets can sell art, with or without exclusivity. Airline catalogs can include million dollar art pieces. Car manufacturers, showrooms and even car repair shops can sell art as well. Everyone should be able to do this, anywhere in the world, especially not just because of the pandemic, but right now, we are in really bad economies.

**What's with the name #Valzubiriagenda**

I was into conspiracy theories in 2018, and this term, *""The Mandela Effect,""* was popular. I had read many times that an artist coined the term, but I had to research online, for her name, many times, before remembering it. I'm not good at remembering names. It took me a year and a half to finally tell you that **Fiona Broome** coined ""The Mandela Effect.""

I also thought I might have to research trademarks and copyrights just to come up with a generic name. So I decided on **""Valzubiriagenda.""** I was not really sure at first, but I decided to use it as the title for my book (with co-author/artist **Silverio Perez**) so that there would be no turning back and I can move on.

**Am I a FUTURIST?**

Someone I recently met this May 2022 just called me a futurist.

In the 1990s, I proposed to a pension fund that they can raise billions of dollars, especially for emergencies, or as needed, or out of desperation, if the pension fund purchases a quantity of art from an artist who not only has a current, reasonable price, but an announced future price that the artist wants to reach.

That future price would obviously be higher than the current price. The art commission contract for multiple art pieces can be taken to the fund's financial lender for a loan. The higher future price can be used for financing purposes.

The pension fund's treasurer, a publicly elected official, said this idea might work, but we had to keep this a secret and discuss this some more, because other pension funds might copy and do this prematurely. This idea had to come from the two of us. The treasurer needed his votes and I needed credentials.

Added into the pot was my idea that I, as the artist, will also write one book-length artist memoir. This was and still is a strong factor, because the leadership and marketing books I had read then mentioned a strong tip. If you want to advance in your field, write a full-length book that is related to the field.

Unfortunately, the elected official, the treasurer of the pension fund, who was also a friend, passed away - he was old and had ailments. At that point in time, I cannot just approach another pension fund treasurer to share this idea with.

I realized I had to write a few memoirs. I needed to set an example for other artists, so I needed to write more than one memoir. Then I felt I should also make ready another book - the how-to of what I'm up to. I wrote **Valzubiriagenda**, which was a memoir of sorts. I knew how long it would take me to write a book, so I had to make sure I can also consider this book a memoir.

In 2008, I imagined that someone like Bernie Madoff, or a fund like Lehman Brothers, would be desperate enough to use this to save themselves and their companies. I was not ready. I had only written 1 manuscript for a memoir.

In 2012, I released **Dollman the Musical, A Memoir of an Artist as a Dollmaker**. Once again, I was not ready because writing it depressed me a little, and I knew I had to write more.

In 2014, I released 3 memoirs, and re-released **Dollman the Musical.** Besides releasing regular books, I released special editions of the 4 books, which had a **""Special Secret Insert for Bankers,""** which explains my ideas of an announced schedule of exponentially increasing prices, to satisfy investors, and the publication of artist memoirs, to satisfy art collectors.

In 2014, I also issued out a press release. Google ***""Can Billion Dollar Artist Save Investors and World Economy Valentino Zubiri PRWeb August 19 2014""*** and you will see the press release.

What I did was stake a claim on my ideas. I did not promote my books and the press release. I just wanted them to stay online, like a sleeping giant or a dormant volcano. I even designed 3 of the book covers to look like indie books from the 1980s. I was planting the seeds, thinking they will eventually grow and bear fruit in the future.

In 2015, I was interviewed by **Richard Syrett,** about one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.** This book is my memoir with paranormal stories. I could have pursued promoting my paranormal stories, but I wanted to be known first as a visual artist and memoirist, so I allowed myself one interview related to **Hocus Pocus Lately. Richard Syrett** has(had?) his own syndicated radio show, **The Conspiracy Show with Richard Syrett,** about the paranormal. He also guest hosts on **Coast to Coast AM**, another internationally syndicated show about the paranormal.

In 2018, I released **Valzubiriagenda** (co-authored by artist **Silverio Perez,** a fellow artist). Finally, this book is ""the how-to of what I'm to.""

I'm going to end this with some strangeness. In 1986, a lady at a religious gathering went into a trance and left a good number of messages. Supposedly, anyone who got into a trance would have messages, but once the trance was over, the person would not remember what was said.

I was not part of the group, but the lady turned her head to face me. She ""foretold"" that whatever I would decide to do in the future, it will take time, but it will be the right thing. This is one of my stories in one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.**

**The Tulipmania of 1634-37**

I discovered that there was this incident of rare tulips becoming collectible during the Dutch Golden Age. There were tulips so rare and so well-desired that their prices equaled to that of a house. You can read more about this online (Wikipedia) or watch a few YouTube videos about it.

Here is the most useful idea that I gleaned from the Tulipmania. The tulip bulbs remained safe inside nurseries. The traders were carrying the deeds of ownership to the tulip bulbs.

**Then NFTs came to the forefront**

I started learning PHP, an HTML scripting language, and MySQL, the database that PHP can connect to in the background, in 1999, when there were only 3 books about PHP and MySQL at the bookstores.

By 2014, I was trying to figure out how to make the ""ledger,"" or database that can be used to update ownership and who can be contacted. If we are trading art, then the art ownership should be updated.

Then NFTs came about. This can be used as our ledger. Everyone can immediately trade NFTs of future, yet-to-be made art pieces, especially because it takes time to make tangible art.

NFTs actually went a step ahead, by allowing digital art to be traded.

The only setback with NFTs, in my opinion, is that it still lacks a commission system for resellers and representatives.

For example, if a café wants to represent me, then they can promote me at their café and on their online pages. If I make one piece of art that will be exclusively represented by a gallery, then that commission will be different and more specific. As ownership is transferred, the subsequent owners should be able to reset the commission. We should also have the option of giving commissions to hundreds of representatives at one time with different percentages if need be.

**The recent crypto crash**

Lately, we have observed that NFTs and cryptocurrencies have been behaving like the stock market and other markets. They have been fluctuating.

I believe that it is time for a trend which discourages fluctuation of prices.

I have also seen YouTube videos where social influencers are encouraging us to be on the lookout for exponentially profitable ventures, because we have all seen this happen with the exponential increase of Bitcoin and Ethereum.

**Let's see if #Valzubiriagenda trends**

We can announce present and future art prices. The galleries won't do this (yet?) because they follow a more traditional approach to the business of art.

*We have a choice of using* ***incrementally*** *or* ***exponentially*** *increasing prices.* We still reserve the right to change things in the future, so everyone should know to follow the latest update.

If this trends, if you as an artist simply announces that you will write an artist memoir, or that you will include the future works in future art books, you might have more art traders, investors and collectors approaching you.

**Get your pen, paper and calculator**

Imagine yourself as an artist, where you are right now. Let's just say you still do not have a book about yourself and your art yet. Imagine now that you have a memoir out there. Don't you think it makes sense to charge more than what you are charging now? Writing and publishing books is just the beginning. I'm just standardizing this approach. The books also say to do other related projects. In my case, getting **Dollman the Musical** onstage is one idea. You will have other related projects, but the publication of memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs will help all of us.

You can also imagine that a law firm that has meeting rooms, with someone who wants to form a local #valzubiriagenda group, can have meetings. A local café can do the same. Local photographers for your art, writers, editors, book designers, proofreaders and others can join in.

I suggest have printed books to share. 15 copies of your memoir or art books will be better than an e-reader or laptop or your phone to show. These gadgets can be stolen, sabotaged, broken, have coffee spilled on them, etc. 15 printed books means simultaneously showing to 15 people. You can even give them away to potential resellers, investors, traders and collectors.

**When it rains, it pours, as in the days of Noah**

There's a saying, ""When it rains, it pours."" There is a negative interpretation and a positive interpretation.

*Negative:* When trouble comes, they cascade to even more.

***Positive:*** When opportunity comes knocking, more follow suit. We can assume that if one gets our art because of #valzubiriagenda, more want to do it now, because of the rising prices, and FOMO - fear of missing out. What will they lose if they miss the boat?

As I have said earlier, if the #valzubiriagenda trends, if you announce a future memoir or art catalog, you might have an increase of investors, traders and art collectors who would want to check you out. You might encourage more sales. Just remember to write and publish that memoir and art catalog.

There's this saying, ""As in the days of Noah."" Imagine Noah, building his ark, with members of his own family, putting all his time and effort into it. Noah was a nice guy. I'm sure every once in a while a neighbor offered him coffee, or chai latte, or whatever refreshing drink they might have back then.

Here's the lesson to be learned. Just because they offered him some type of bubble tea drink, or coca cola, they still didn't make it to the ark. Rubbing shoulders with actors does not make you an actor. I have told my artist friends to write their memoirs. They told me that once they see me succeed, after all these many years of seeing my seemingly useless efforts, then they will write their memoirs and follow the road that I had paved for them.

Good luck to them, but if I were you, act now, get my art or make art. Support the 5-year old artist whose parent promised to release a comprehensive art catalog. If you get that 5-year old's art, and mine, I would be honored to be in the same art catalog that you will produce. I'm already successful at that point. You have gotten the mission just right.

I have already claimed to have written the most book-length artist memoirs in the world. Dethrone that claim. Barter. Use ghostwriters. Success to me means facing God one day and saying, I wrote my memoirs and left the world a legacy of books and art. I will not tell God, smiling and proudly, that I encouraged a run for my art by announcing a schedule of exponentially increasing prices that reached 9 figures. I'm sure God knows we had fun.

1plx7wo,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1plx7wo,"My $1,000 facelift of my kitchen annex, with coffee bar, after and before","You guys were SO awesome when I posted my kitchen facelift earlier in the year, but once the kitchen was done, the area between the kitchen and the back door looked a little, well, bad in comparison. So I spent the last 8 weekends giving this area a little facelift, too. As it’s such a small space that has to accomplish so much (coatroom, coffee bar, utility closet, and stair landing), I had to design it literally down to the inch to make sure everything fit just perfectly, and I had to make EVERYTHING bespoke. The only things I didn’t make  myself were the hardware and the chandelier, but even the shelves were made from scratch, using quarter-sawn white oak raw slabs.

Although the rest of the kitchen has unlacquered brass accents, I wanted this little room to look cozier, so I went with copper everything.

I wanted the coffee bar to look like a French cafe window, so I made an awning frame out of copper pipe and sewed the awning cover. I hid directional lighting under the awning to light the top shelf, then used strip lighting, half covered with copper tape, under the two shelves to ensure it was all well-lit.

The base of the coffee bar came together with some luck; I found an antique slab of marble that was \*exactly\* the size I needed, and then I bought a copper console sink base which I had to cut down to the right depth and width and re-assemble. The copper tub underneath provides extra storage.

We also needed extra storage by the back door so I made the hanging black storage box on the hall tree, with scalloped edges to match the awning. I additionally made the shelves for the antique hall tree, as it was originally an umbrella holder.  The shelves now house my antique Chinese duck boxes, which provide yet more storage.

For the coat room area, I put up some leftover beadboard I had from another project, then added copper-painted coat hooks and hat hooks (we’ll have to see how long the copper paint holds up), along with a row of wooden pegs along the bottom to hang our sneakers. I then sewed and installed a fabric divider between the coat area and the coffee bar, to make each space look more finished and intentional. Copper pipe attached to a strip of red oak provided the foundation for the divider. The strip of red oak also serves as a way to hide the cords from the coffee bar lighting. I included a photo of the divider so you can see how it’s made.

Lastly, I needed to figure out how to make the utility closet look more attractive, so I made a curtain rod from copper pipe and sewed a large curtain to give me exactly the look I wanted. The plastic trash cans were also painted copper.  Not seen in the photos are the commercial-grade broom/mop mounts I installed to keep everything tidy behind the curtain.

Of course, there was also a lot of painting involved, including the window frame on the back door, and peel-and-stick tile behind the coffee bar to match the backsplash in the kitchen.

I’m really thrilled how much this effort has elevated such an important but small space in the house, and it’s sooo much nicer to come home to this space after a long day instead of how it looked before.  I hope you like this space, too, and maybe got some ideas for your own DIY projects!",2,1765663115.0,kitchenremodel,0,1.0,False
1plx7wi,https://www.reddit.com/r/budget/comments/1plx7wi/i_took_a_picture_of_every_purchase_i_made_for_a/,I took a picture of every purchase I made for a year and it completely changed my relationship with money,"I've always been terrible with money - living paycheck to paycheck despite making decent income ($68K). Last April, after another month of wondering where my money went, I decided to take a photo of EVERY single purchase for a full year. Not just checking the banking app, but literally taking a quick photo of every coffee, every impulse purchase online (picture of the screen), and every bill.


Seeing it all laid out visually was honestly shocking. I discovered:

1. I was spending nearly $350/month on convenience store stops (energy drinks, snacks, etc.)

2. My ""occasional"" food delivery was actually averaging $410/month

3. I had 7 subscription services I barely used totalling $68/month

The most eye-opening part wasn't even the big numbers, but seeing how the small daily purchases added up.

After six months of tracking and gradually changing habits, I went from saving basically nothing to consistently putting away $750/month. I've built my first-ever emergency fund ($5,800 so far) and started contributing to my 401k beyond the employer match.

1plx6jb,https://i.redd.it/reysb75om17g1.jpeg,WHY I CALLED OUT THE RECRUITER.,"I'm not being rude, I'm defending my time and professionalism.

To everyone saying I should have just been ""professional"" and accepted the recruiter's excuse: I did keep it professional when I initially decided to withdraw my application due to the lack of respect shown for my time.

Here's why I called her out and why her emergency does not excuse the lack of a single, brief email to dozens of candidates:

1. My Time is Valuable (and Limited)

This wasn't just a 15-minute coffee break. I am a working nurse. To be available for that interview, I had to dedicate my time off—time that is precious, hard-earned, and often vital for recovery from exhausting shifts. Taking that time off involves scheduling, coordinating, and using up PTO/vacation time. For her team to simply let that dedicated time go to waste with zero communication is not an unfortunate mishap; it is a profound failure of professional organization and courtesy.

2. Professionalism is a Two-Way Street

We, as nurses, are expected to remain professional 24/7, even when we are dealing with high acuity, understaffing, burnout, and bully management—all while being underpaid. What do we get in return? Recruiters who can't take two minutes to send a mass email or ask a colleague to step in during an ""emergency."" If they want my professionalism, they must earn my respect by showing basic competence and respect for my schedule.

3. They are NOT the Only Hospital

This isn't some small, unique clinic. This is a major Midwest hospital. They are one of many. I am not going to let a potential employer waste my limited time before I even step through the door. If this is the level of respect they show candidates, I can only imagine how they treat their current staff.

Standing up for my time is standing up for my worth. When we normalize letting employers treat our time as disposable, we are telling them we accept the existing, unfair system. I choose not to. I am fighting for my time, and that's not rude—it's necessary.

I'll take my skills and my professionalism to one of the many other hospitals in the Midwest that understands basic courtesy.",9,1765663018.0,nursing,5,0.68,False

I'm just looking for people's opinions on this 18x24 charcoal and how I can improve. Specifically, improving my perspective.

1plx2ho,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1plx2ho/anyone_else_get_really_depressed_sometimes/,Anyone else get really depressed sometimes because they can't drink caffeine?,"I've been a Badista for 15 of the last 20 years. I hope this is relevant for the sub, I want the opinion of fellow baristas who are in a similar position. 

I'm in a great place health-wise considering, But I have not been able to consume caffeine in 8 or 9 years. After being obsessed with it throughout my twenties, it started messing with me, and today it makes me really unwell whenever I consume it, and exacerbates my cornucopia of chronic illnesses.

Luckily, in the work realm, my first manager/owner trained us to be able to make coffee with all five senses, so I never have to taste the coffee I make to know it's good.

But I often get remiss about it. I love the taste, I love the smell, I love above all the caffeine buzz (And obviously, the love of that buzz is what made me overindulge back in the day).

But I honestly don't think I'll ever be able to consume it again in my life. And I'm close to accepting it, but I still feel sadness.

I’m 32, single, and hoping to connect with someone around a similar age. I produce my own music and have been doing that for the past few years. Recently I have gotten into coding with the assistance of AI to develop intelligent accessibility scripts to increase speech feedback for screen reader users in the music production program Reaper, which has been a very exciting journey for me as I am someone who is Blind. 

I enjoy swimming, bowling, rock climbing, and traveling. I also love learning new things—lately I’ve been diving into meteorology, sociology, and psychology.

I’m looking for someone who enjoys great conversation and going out for meals, to places like cafes, restaurants, and lounges. I don’t drink and would much prefer either chats in coffee shops, lounges, restaurants rather than a night out on the town. 

I identify as asexual (or somewhere on that spectrum), so I’m more focused on emotional and romantic connection than anything physical. If you’re the same—or just value deep connection—I’d love to chat. 

I’ve never let being blind stop me from living fully. 

I’m open to chatting with people from anywhere especially from the UK, US  Europe, and even further afield such as places like Australia and seeing how things develop. Europe, especially the UK is best for time zone compatibility, but again, I don’t mind chatting to people from anywhere.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Cal vs. Northwestern State: A Golden Bears Blowout or a Rare Upset?**

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a basketball mismatch so stark, it’s like watching a toddler play chess against Magnus Carlsen… while the toddler’s move is to knock over the board and eat the pieces. The California Golden Bears (9-1, 8-0 at home) host the Northwestern State Demons (2-7, 1-6 on the road) on December 13, 2025, and the odds reflect a lopsided affair. Cal is a **20.5-point favorite**, with the over/under set at 147.5. Let’s break this down with the precision of a surgeon and the humor of a stand-up comic who’s had one too many coffee shots.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Why Cal is the Golden Standard

Cal’s stats are as imposing as a 10-foot wall of cheese at a dairy farm. They’re outscoring opponents by **13.9 points per game**, shoot **47.1% from the field**, and rank **73rd in offensive efficiency** (which, in college basketball, is basically “above average, but not LeBron-level godlike”). Their defense? A fortress. Opponents average just **69.1 points per game** against them—thanks in part to sophomore **Justin Pippen**, who’s been a one-man wrecking crew lately. Pippen dropped 24 on the Dominican Penguins last time out, slicing and dicing like a chef with a 10-second window to make sashimi.

Northwestern State, meanwhile, is the basketball equivalent of a screensaver—colorful but ineffective. They shoot **43.9%**, which sounds decent until you realize Cal’s opponents shoot **40.6%**. The Demons rank **340th in defense**, allowing **107.8 points per 100 possessions**. To put that in perspective, their defense is like a sieve made of Jell-O. If a toddler threw a pie at them, the filling would escape before the crust hit the ground.

The spread of **20.5 points** is so steep, it’s practically a dare. Cal has covered **every time they’ve been favored by 20+ points**, while Northwestern State is 0-1 ATS as a 20.5-point underdog. The only way this game gets closer is if Cal’s players decide to shoot only with their non-dominant hands and Northwestern’s star, Micah Thomas, invents the three-point shot mid-game.

---

### News Digest: Cal’s “Dead Week” Distraction and Northwestern’s Desperation

Cal’s recent win over the Dominican Penguins wasn’t pretty in the first half—**18% shooting, two assists**—but they rallied like a Netflix series that’s *just* goo

I asked a question about a specific idea last night, and the response was generally ""no, don't do that"" so I wanted to think of something else lol

This will be for a potential 8th date, and it's with the same girl from my previous post (the one about the perpetual stew, I'm sure many of you saw it given the numbers 😅). She is coming over tomorrow night to celebrate Hanukkah with me (I'm Jewish, she isn't), so that will be a sort of 7th date. I want to ask her to make it official but probably won't tomorrow unless there is a clear opportunity. I'm pretty sure she will say yes but just want to do it on a date that isn't so much about me since this one is for a holiday she doesn't celebrate.

My original idea was to take her to the cemetery with me as I go every Saturday, but this was what everyone said not to do. I usually go on Saturday nights (around 1 am but would move up to a normal hour for a date) just to spend time with the graves that don't get any visitors, and I'll usually bring a little picnic and just like talk to the graves and play music from their life time. I thought she might be into it because she's a little goth/alternative but everyone said it was creepy regardless, so I guess that's a no.

For full context, we started dating after matching on Hinge last month (the stew being the most recent one), but we already knew each other. She was in my cohort in grad school 3 years ago but I didn't really talk to her at all while I was there. She did try to have conversations with me a lot and she admitted recently she had a crush on me but thought I hated her, but I honestly didn't notice and just didn't think she would be interested in me at the time lol

I'm not really sure what a good ""normal"" date would be. We've done all the usual stuff like having coffee, seeing movies, went to a museum, explored an abandoned courthouse, etc. So I don't know what to do that isn't boring. I only recently started dating again after a 5ish year break and haven't gotten this far with anyone, so it's all a little rusty.

Some basic information on her is that she is Korean (but moved to the US with family when she was 7), studied marine biology in grad school, is non-religious/agnostic, doesn't really like anything with large crowds of people, has a lot of tattoos but I personally won't get one, etc. Not sure what all is relevant.

	•	You can text questions like “How much left for groceries?”

	•	Landing page live: heynudge.app

	•	Still building the backend (learning as I go)

	•	Zero customers, just validating demand

1plwsgt,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskGaybrosOver30/comments/1plwsgt/hookup_protocol/,Hookup Protocol,I just started Grindr and Scruff. My profile says I’m looking for dates and eventually a committed relationship. Many of the messages I’m receiving are looking for a hookup. Although I usually am not impressed with dick and ass photos there are admittedly some that get my motor running. The idea of getting together that evening or that week is a turn on. The counter is feeling like it might be a bad idea to invite a stranger into my home. Ive been asking for a coffee date to resolve my anxiety but this seems to ruin the mood for many. What is the best practice? ,2,1765661996.0,AskGaybrosOver30,8,1.0,False

1plwrou,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1plwrou/drowned_choir/,Drowned Choir,"If you've ever been to St. Lazarus Baptist Church, the Victorian style building, way off of the road, in the rolling Carolina  fields, you probably have your own story. You probably got dragged to church every sunday with your grandma, made up in your finest dress with your hair pinned up or slicked back. You probably got in the old rusty truck to carpool down the dusty old red road, maybe sat in the bed with the other big kids because only babies sat in laps up front. You probably got baptized in the front behind the cathedral, spring fed and always warm. You probably felt the vibration in the water and heard the drowned choir below. 

Let me reel it in, in case you aren't one of the congregation, past or present. In case you haven't heard the baptismal choir. I was one of these kids, I'd sit in my grandma's lap as she put my hair in bows and sang hymns to me, real softly with her eyes closed. I don't know how she managed to braid so precisely with closed eyes. I never liked this routine, the fact I got pulled in from playing outside in the sticks with the boys. They were expected to be dirty, nobody would bat an eye if a little boy had a smudge of dirt on his cheek or a crumpled shirt. But a girl with a thread out of place in her skirt would get dirty looks and muttered judgement from the church elders. 

I didn't care much for judgement, I got dirty anyway. And my grandma understood, she grew up with brothers herself. In fact, I remember once at Christmas time, when I was in a red skirt with a big bow, I had so much mud on my blouse it almost looked like a pattern. Me and the boys had been having snowball fights and found out mud made them stick better. I had walked down to find our usual pew, near the front by a space hater, with my grandma close behind. Service began as normal, candles were lit and Christmas blessings given. An old greying woman scowled at me as she sang. After, my grandma got up from the pew and went over to the priest's wife, got real close to her and said something. It must've been something nasty because the woman's face turned into an awful snarl, like a dog with her lips curled back. I was outside with the other girls when my grandma joined us. She had a red mark like a handprint on her cheek, but her lips were still upturned in a smile. I asked about it, and she just shook her head and put a hand through my hair.

“Let's hurry before the truck leaves us behind. Or we'll catch our deaths.”

The years passed, and me and my grandma slowly got pushed back to the pews by the door, some social movement to make us colder, farther from the elders and other kids enjoying the heat. Nobody gave us a second glance when we got in, none of the adults, at least. Kids don't understand the tension in the air, maybe we were too short to see it in the cold stares of the adults. I played before in between and after, like always. The nuns huddled together and looked down their noses at others in their cloaks of shadows, like always. And the pastor looked grim and gaunt, like always.

My 12th birthday was coming up quickly, and I was excited. When any kid turned 12, they got to be baptized, they were seen as old enough to fully accept the church's grace. It was a sacred ceremony, and only a few people got to see it. The kid, of course, the pastor, and the kids closest parent or relative. And with it, the kids were given a list of rules they could not break or share with those younger. Every kid was excited, it felt important to be given any duty to uphold. Then we were finally seen as equals by the adults who shared the same secrets. 

My closest friend, Rebecca, turned 12 a week before I did. We were summer babies, born in the warm month of July. I was ecstatic, probably more so than she was. I found her early in the morning, when people were still pouring in and finding coffee before they sat down. She was sitting criss-cross applesauce against the wall, looking conflicted. I skipped over to her and sat down, too.

“Becca! Aren't you excited? You're basically gonna be a grown up soon.” I chattered on, listing things off on my hand about the things she could do as an ‘adult’. 

“You can get married, have babies, get a job..” I shook her shoulder while I spoke, getting her excited. It worked, and soon she was buzzing with energy. Neither of us really understood the hell of teenage years or the following monotony of adulthood. To us, being baptized was like a fairytale where we finally got our fairy wings and met our prince charming. The other teenage girls looked fondly on their baptisms and gushed about how wonderful it was to join the church fully, and how fun the choir was. The boys were similar, but they tried to act nonchalant about it. I knew they were excited. Every kid that got baptized joined the choir, it was considered the way of paying the church's blessing forward.

I eased her nerves with conversation, and she bolted up when the pastor emerged from a different room in his sacred robes, looking at her with a nod. She flattened down her dress with her hands and flashed a smile before hurrying to his side. I gave her a thumbs up, and the priest looked at me with disdain. I was deliberately obtuse at this time, I saw the adults' looks and it only encouraged me to rebel further. I gave him a wave before he turned around and vanished through the door with Rebecca at his side. The baptism ceremony was fast, maybe a few minutes long, and the pastor came back in. His long white sleeves were dark with water at the cuffs. Everyone sat down in their usual spot, my grandma pulling me up from the floor and to a pew. She laid her head on my shoulder. The service began, the sermon ended, and the choir emerged. I saw Rebecca standing with the older girls and I beamed. She was glowing, her smile bright. I could've sworn her teeth even seemed whiter, but it might've been her dark green robes acting as contrast. I waved to her. She didn't wave back, but she pressed her lips into a thin smile, and that was enough. 

The week dragged on endlessly as I went through the boring summer routines of cleaning up around the house and working in the garden. Sunday-my birthday- couldn't come fast enough. Now that I think about it, every kid's birthday was on a Sunday, regardless of the month. Every kid had their birthday on the lord's day of rest. When Sunday finally came, I was careful to mend each split end and polish my shoes until they gleamed. I wore my grandma's old dress, it was purple in a patchwork pattern above the waist, and fastened with a sparkly belt. I looked at myself in the mirror and felt older. My grandma tied my hair in a long braid that cascaded down the small of my back. I felt like royalty walking into church that day, and I could've sworn some of the nuns were proud. But, maybe it was just a trick of the light. 

I couldn't find Rebecca anywhere, and I felt a lump forming in my throat. Sure, I was excited, but I still wanted the comfort of my best friend in this monumental stage of my life. I gave up looking for her when Father Tobias motioned for me to follow him outside to the basin, behind the church by the spring. My grandma put her hand on my shoulder and guided me out of the church. This was the first time I'd seen the vessel, and it looked mystical. Wildflowers sprouted up in random spots, and the spring calmly rolled on with a soothing trickling sound. Trees with pale bark peeked out from the woodlands nearby, birds fluttered around but did not land in the water. Some of them drank from its spring at the edge, and their songs reverberated off of its surface. 

Father Thomas snapped me out of my trance by clearing his throat with an off putting mucus-y sound and gestured for me to start. I sat on the lip of the stone pool and nodded excitedly to my grandmother, who was standing nearby. I was too excited to listen to the actual words he read from a section of the Bible. Reflecting back on it, I think I was more excited about getting older than joining the church. After he finished reading, he put a cold hand to my temple and guided my head back into the water. I closed my eyes and took a deep breath, before I was submerged. It felt warm and I didn't want to leave. I wasn't under for long, but it felt like a dream. I remember opening my eyes  underwater and seeing nothing but darkness. I remember the humming in my ears and the soft whispers I couldn't quite make out. After an eternity of this silent song, I was pulled back up and blessed. 

I am a member of the church now. A member of the choir, too. I don't remember what the voices told me exactly, but I do remember it was something sacred, the rules I could not break. I would serve until the next kid turned 12, and the oldest was a girl who was only 8. I had replaced Rebecca and she was honored to become a nun in only a week. When it is time, I will join the whispers below and guide the girl to do the same.

During Easter service, the basin overflows for the first time. The choir spills out into a wet mouth without a face and bellows a great song in perfect harmony. ",1,1765661937.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False
1plwqkd,https://www.reddit.com/r/LPR/comments/1plwqkd/success_and_how_strict_i_had_to_be_for_it/,Success and how strict I had to be for it,"12 months ago I had the following symptoms 

- difficulty swallowing 
- hoarse voice 
- chronic throat clearing
- blocked nose
- slight phlegm production
- ear fullness 
- post nasal drip 
- heart palpitations
- fever 
- dizziness 
- depression 

They were quite severe, after 3 months of being mostly strict I saw improvement that was gradual. 

After 9 months I was symptom free.

I will also say that not everyone is the same, I know some people are very strict and still don't get symptom free. But for those who aren't wholly strict I am writing this to explain just how strict you have to be to potentially be symptom free.

I have found that unless you are completely strict and do everything you can, you cannot be symptom free, and as little as 2-3 bad habits being done can cause many issues, even so much as a couple of coffees, some alcohol, some fatty food can put your progress back a week. 

This is what I have found to be best 

- diet is absolutely number 1, you can have all the PPI, famotadine, gaviscon, but unless your diet is very strict it doesn't matter at all 

- eliminate all fatty foods, sugary foods and drink, be very strict with your diet, eventually when I was symptom free I am able to have 1-2 moderately loose meals per week and I am fine. Even pepper is not good. 

- use chatgpt or Google. I even take a photo or upload a menu to chatgpt if I go out and ask ""what is the most LPR friendly food here"" and it will even tell me what to modify to make it best, eg nude steak with vege, rather than having all the sauces, pepper, etc

- eliminate caffeine, smoking, alcohol, drugs completely until you are symptom free. This may be difficult for people but unless you want to feel better you have to. What helps me is that I know I will enjoy the thing for a short period of time, but is it worth the 5-7 days of issues in return? Once you become symptom free you can try to incorporate some of this in very strict moderation, for example I have 1-2 cigarettes per week with no issues 

- PPI in the morning, famotadine at night, gaviscon after every meal and before bed, nasal cleanse when you feel the post nasal drip. Especially with those who have ear issues, the nasal cleanse will flush out the inner ear, it has made a great difference for me with recovery. 

- wait until you are symptom free or close to symptom free before introducing potentially harmful things to know how much they affect you. So you can have a baseline and know what will affect you and how badly. For me it takes 2-3 days to know the true damage it has done. 

- be patient and persist. It takes a long time to see improvement, every time you stray from the strictness you are delaying and delaying. The best time to bite the bullet is now to feel better eventually. 

After 9 months of being very strict I was symptom free. For the past 3 months I have been doing trial and error, seeing how far I can push it without having issues, and to be honest it's not very far. I had subway two days in a row which included some pepper, caused me issues. 4 Oreos, caused me issues. Having sushi 3 times a week, caused me issues. But as I have gone along I have learned a lot and can manage it very well and I am in firm control. 

I work a sales job, talk a lot, go to the gym, play soccer, enjoy life and can indulge, but very sparingly and smartly. 

If you persist and be very strict, you can give yourself the best chance to feel normal again one day. ",2,1765661856.0,LPR,1,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Prediction: Brandon Royval vs. Manel Kape – The ""Who’s the Favorite?"" Show**

Let’s cut to the chase: **Manel Kape** is being treated like a Las Vegas magician, with odds fluctuating between -295 (per Yahoo Sports) and -330 (per the New York Post), depending on whether the oddsmakers had coffee that morning. Meanwhile, **Brandon Royval** is the underdog with the “I’ll take your money and your doubts” +220 to +250 line. The MMA Junkie staff? Nine out of 11 picked Kape, which is about as surprising as a churro at a donut shop.

**The Stats:**

* **Kape’s resume**: 6 of his last 7 wins via stoppage. He’s a counter-striker with a takedown defense rating that makes a vault look vulnerable.
* **Royval’s edge**: Aggressive, forward pressure with a “I’ll wear you down before I’ll let you breathe” style. His last loss? A split decision to Joshua Van—hardly a disgrace.

**The Betting Herd**: 63% of readers back Kape, presumably because they’ve never heard of a “sucker bet.” But here’s a hot take: Royv

1plwncs,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1plwncs/sp_black_abyss_white_flower/,"[SP] Black Abyss, White Flower","The notification arrived on a Monday morning.

The envelope was thin, without letterhead, bearing only the address and his name. Inside there was a single printed sheet, written in standard, concise language, reminding him that he had thirty days to complete the cleaning and verification of the condition of the property; otherwise, the property would be considered ownerless and would move on to the next phase of the procedure. In the lower right corner there was a stamp. The date had already passed two days earlier.

He folded the paper, unfolded it again, looked at the date, and folded it once more before returning it to the envelope. He left the envelope in a corner of the desk, beneath a pile of old documents. The edge of the paper stuck out slightly, like a thin white tongue that sometimes brushed against other papers when he moved them, but he never pulled it out completely.

The key was still in his possession.

The mere existence of the key gave him an illusion: as long as the key was there, the house would remain in an unfinished state. And what is unfinished can always be postponed. To postpone means not having to face it today.

He told himself: tomorrow I’ll go.

The next day he didn’t. Nor the third.

He didn’t even look for an excuse. Every morning when he “should” have gone, he put the key in his pocket and, just before leaving, changed it to another pocket, leaving it on the table. The gesture was natural, almost automatic. At night, when he returned, he touched the key with the tips of his fingers, running over the metal teeth, as if confirming that something still existed, not that something needed to be done.

During the following two weeks, he went to work as usual.

The place where he worked was not especially solemn, but neither was it chaotic. Every day people came in to sign, submit documents, collect receipts. The air was saturated with a persistent smell of old paper mixed with coffee and disinfectant. The windows were never fully opened; the noise of the street constantly seeped in, like a background that could never be expelled.

His job was called “on-site verification.” Essentially, it consisted of visiting properties that were to be reclaimed, transferred, demolished, or re-registered, checking their structure and remains, filling out forms, and signing. Most of the time it was nothing more than an administrative step. People handed him the keys hoping he would finish quickly so they could go on with their lives.

He had always considered it an administrative job.

In the first week he inspected the apartment of a deceased elderly man. The children lived outside the city and had entrusted the procedure to an agency. The flat was excessively tidy; the bed made as if no one had slept in it. In the kitchen there were two identical sets of plates and cutlery: one clean, the other also clean. He wrote “no issues” and signed. On his way down, a neighbor asked him in the hallway:

“When will someone come to live here?”

“Soon,” he replied.

The neighbor nodded, as if he had been given a concrete date.

In the second week he went to an abandoned rural house. The owner had debts, the water and electricity had been cut off for a long time, the yard was full of weeds. Inside there was nothing of value, only the sound of plastic bags moved by the wind. In the “risks” section he wrote: “doors and windows to be replaced.” He knew that this phrase implied someone else would come later, that the process would continue. A single sentence was enough for the flow to move forward.

He liked that way of working.

Not out of coldness, but out of simplicity. The world was divided into boxes, and each box had a standard answer. As long as you filled things out according to the rules, you didn’t make mistakes. Not making mistakes meant not being remembered. Not being remembered meant being safe.

The notification still hadn’t been fully taken out.

In the third week, one afternoon, he finally went to that street.

He didn’t make the decision in the morning, but after lunch, when at an intersection he suddenly changed direction. He walked slowly. He even stopped at a fruit shop and bought two oranges. He carried them in a plastic bag; the smell of the peel lingered on his hand. It was as if he needed to manufacture proof that this was an ordinary day.

Roadworks had closed half the street and forced a detour. He took a wrong turn once and had to go back. Standing on the corner, he realized it had been a long time since he’d had to confirm his orientation like that. Before, he had always gone straight in without thinking.

The number hadn’t changed.

The key stuck a little when he put it into the lock. He turned it harder and the cylinder made a dry click before opening. Inside there was no bad smell, which gave him slight relief. Houses left empty for a long time usually accumulate a damp odor; this one hadn’t. The air was dry, as if it had been exposed to the sun.

He opened the windows and followed the procedure.

Living room, bedroom, kitchen: everything met the conditions of “state suitable for processing.” The walls bore old marks, but nothing structural; the water and electricity had long been cut off, with no leaks. He checked the corresponding boxes with a small, firm handwriting, as always.

On the floor he saw a rectangular stain, slightly darker: there had once been a table or a cabinet there. The furniture was gone. The mark remained, like the shadow of something cut out.

He paused for a moment in the bedroom.

The bed was still there, as was the mattress, but the sheets had been changed; they weren’t the old ones. He touched them: dry, smooth. The wardrobe was almost empty, but the hangers were still hanging, carefully aligned, as if they could be used again at any moment. When he closed the wardrobe door, the wood rubbed with a faint sound, as if it didn’t want to close completely.

In the kitchen there were several glasses. One had a chipped rim. He remembered that defect. The memory went no further, but his hand lingered for a moment on that glass, as if confirming an irrecoverable but real fact.

The balcony was the last point.

The door was open. Outside there was a pot with a plant. The leaves were growing with too much vitality. Some new leaves were a lighter green and moved gently in the wind.

He stopped.

That plant did not belong to the “normal state” of the property. It was too new, too alive. It gave the impression that someone had been there, that someone was still taking care of it. And yet inside there were no human traces: no damp glasses, no trash, no clothes, no warmth.

He crouched down and stirred the soil in the pot a little.

It was damp, not from recent rain but from regular watering. The soil was loose, not compacted. On the surface there were small stones, like those usually found in the yard.

He remembered the thing with the cat clearly.

It had been that winter. When the yard began to smell bad, it was already too late. The cat had died in a corner, without a collar, without anyone claiming it. Maintenance staff came once, said it had to be cleaned up, but never had time. Then it snowed, and the smell was covered. In spring, when the yard was cleaned, the soil was dug up; part of it was removed, and the rest was used to fill the pot.

At the time, no one thought it was a problem.

Because then everyone wanted winter to end, for the yard to “return to normal.” And normal, very often, is nothing more than not seeing. As long as you don’t see, things seem to have passed.

He went back inside and spread the form on the table. The observations section was empty. As long as he didn’t write anything, that issue wouldn’t exist. The property would be classified as “no issues” and would soon move on to the delivery phase. Delivery meant that the key would no longer be with him, that the process would swallow that void.

He picked up the pen and held it suspended over the blank space.

Outside, the noise of the construction was intermittent. Metal blows echoed in the empty house with excessive intensity. He thought of the other tasks he had pending, the files piled up in the office, and that if he didn’t return that day, the next would be more complicated.

He put the pen down.

He signed.

Before leaving, he went back to the balcony and moved the pot a little inward, away from the direct wind. That gesture was not part of any procedure and would not be recorded. He did it carefully, as if afraid of disturbing something.

When he closed the door, he didn’t lock it.

On the way down he crossed paths with a child, crouched in the entrance, watching ants. The child looked up at him, looked at him for a second, and then lowered his head again, as if he had already confirmed that he was not someone to talk to. He stepped around the ants as he passed, walking softly. The child said nothing.

From the other end of the street came the sounds of construction. They were repairing the roadway; the lifted ground revealed the underlying layer of soil. It wasn’t a large excavation, but it was enough to force a detour. The workers rested to one side: some drank water, others smoked.

He went around the area without stopping.

When he reached the corner, he turned and looked once more at the house. The plant on the balcony was still moving with the wind, with a slight but constant sway.

He merged into the crowd and ceased to be visible.

During the following days, everything seemed normal.

He officially filed the notification and marked the status as “processed.” He continued receiving new tasks, new addresses, new keys. That house soon disappeared from his agenda, like a box already checked.

Until the file was returned.

Not because of a missing signature or a date error. The reason for the return was a single line:

“The situation in situ does not match what was declared. A new verification is required.”

He stared at that line for a long time.

“Situation in situ.” Four light words that nevertheless seemed to reopen a door. They meant that someone had gone, that someone had seen, that the plant was no longer something only he knew about.

The new verification required his presence.

They asked him to be there the next afternoon, at the entrance of the building.

He arrived ten minutes early. Standing there, he suddenly thought of a detail: the last time he hadn’t locked the door. It didn’t violate any rule, but it wasn’t prudent either. He didn’t know why he hadn’t done it; perhaps it was an oversight, perhaps he didn’t want to close it completely.

Two people were already waiting for him.

One carried a folder; the clothes were clean, the shoes too new for someone who frequently entered old houses. The other spoke quietly on the phone, using terms he couldn’t quite hear. When they saw him, one of them nodded, as if confirming his identity.

“Are you the person responsible for this property?” one asked.

“Yes,” he replied.

“Let’s go up.”

The door was open. The air was different, with a smell of things that had been disturbed. In the living room they had spread out a plastic sheet, like an improvised work table. On the balcony, the pot was pushed aside; the surface of the soil showed clear signs of having been disturbed. Beside it there was a semi-transparent plastic bag with the soil already separated.

One of them crouched and examined the contents with gloves.

“This isn’t ordinary gardening soil,” he said.

The tone was neutral, without looking at him. But he felt those words were not a simple observation, but a conclusion. And conclusions imply that a prior judgment has already been made, one from which he was excluded.

“Explain,” said the one with the folder.

For a moment he thought of saying “I don’t know.” That phrase was a common shield in the administrative system. But he immediately understood it was already too late. The soil was in a bag, ready to be numbered. Saying “I don’t know” would only make the matter uglier.

“There was a cat buried in the yard,” he said.

As soon as he said it, he knew there was no turning back.

There was no surprise. Only more notes.

“Who handled it?” they asked.

He was silent for a second.

“During the yard cleaning… maintenance,” he said.

“Who exactly?”

He didn’t know. He knew it had happened without problems, without leaving a trace. Now they wanted a name. A name turns facts into responsibility, and responsibility into a path you can no longer control.

“I don’t know,” he said, this time with a voice lower than he expected.

“Were you the person responsible for verification at that time?” they asked.

“No. I didn’t do this job yet.”

“Then how do you know?”

Because he had been there. Because he had touched that soil. Because the cat had been treated as something that needed to be “resolved,” and he resolved things for a living.

“I heard it from the neighbors,” he replied.

They didn’t ask which neighbors. They simply wrote it down, fitting uncertain information into a box that demanded to be filled.

The verification didn’t take long.

Photos, sealing, numbering. Before leaving, they told him the case required a supplementary note for irregular handling of biological remains and that there would be further communications.

“Give us the key,” they said.

He handed it over. The metal made a faint sound as it fell into another hand. He suddenly felt that his wrist was a little lighter, as if he had lost a familiar weight.

“Sign here.”

He signed in a section he had only seen once before: temporary custody.

On the way back he walked slowly.

He had always thought everything ended when verification was finished. To verify meant to know, to know meant to resolve, to resolve meant to turn the page. That was how processes worked; that was how they had always comforted him. But now he understood that some matters don’t enter the system to be closed, but to expand. The system is a net: at first it covers a house, then it starts covering people.

In the days that followed he kept going to work.

No one mentioned the matter directly. Everyone was busy. Each person had their documents and deadlines. A colleague asked him about a key; he pointed to the drawer and then remembered he no longer had it.

“That one’s gone,” he said. “It’s in custody.”

The colleague nodded without noticing anything strange. In the office, “custody” was a common word.

But he began to notice small changes.

One day he went to the archive to look for an old form. He swiped his card and the door didn’t open. He thought it was a glitch, tried again. Nothing. The attendant came out and opened it with his own card.

“The system may have been updated,” he said. “Check it later.”

He said “okay.”

Then he understood that his card was still the same, but it no longer opened doors naturally. Someone had to help him. It was a minimal change, but minimal changes are usually the first ones.

Days later he received an email: he had to attend a meeting to complete the supplementary note. Friday, nine in the morning, in a room in another building.

He arrived on time.

There were three people. He recognized one: a supervisor of process review who almost never went into the field. He wore thin-framed glasses and a gaze made for tables. He didn’t know the other two: one took notes, the other explained articles of the regulations.

The meeting began immediately.

“You carried out the verification of that property, correct?”

“Yes.”

“Did you detect any anomaly?”

“No.”

“Didn’t the plant pot seem like an anomaly to you?”

He was silent for a second.

“I thought it belonged to a later occupant.”

“Why didn’t you record it in observations?”

“I considered it didn’t affect structural safety.”

The supervisor looked at him, evaluating whether that phrase fit into any box.

“Patio soil is a special category,” the other intervened. “It implies biological remains. Even if it doesn’t affect the structure, it should have been recorded.”

“I understand,” he said.

The pen of the person taking minutes didn’t stop.

The meeting dragged on. Rules, articles, definitions were repeated. It didn’t seem they were trying to prove he had done something wrong, but rather insisting on what he hadn’t done. That empty space grew with every word, attracting more explanations, more records.

Before finishing, the supervisor said:

“Until the note is completed, your accreditation is suspended. You will not participate in on-site verifications. You will move to internal tasks.”

“Understood,” he replied.

He said those words with almost automatic calm. But he knew something had shifted: he would no longer go to properties, no longer carry keys, no longer sign decisions that pushed things into the system.

Back at the office, the supervisor left a new task sheet on his desk.

“Start with this. Organize old files. Complete what’s missing.”

He looked at the header. It was an ordinary sheet, like so many others. But he understood they had placed him where he couldn’t make mistakes: because there was no judgment there, only completion.

He began to organize files.

The files were endless. Yellowed papers, white ones, worn ones. Each with other people’s addresses, other people’s names, other people’s “no issues.” Sometimes he recognized a street name and felt a small jolt, but he turned the page quickly. He didn’t want to find himself in those papers.

The process of the supplementary note dragged on.

What they asked for wasn’t complicated: date of treatment, place, whether there was a record, whether it was possible to identify those responsible. What was complicated was “responsible.” No one really wanted to know who had dug the soil. The system only needed an entry point, someone on whom to hang the void. And the clearest point was him, because he had signed.

For the first time he understood what a signature is: it doesn’t express an opinion, it fixes a position. You think you’re closing a job, but for the system you’re committing yourself to the entire state of affairs. If in that state there is a dead cat, you are bound to its number.

A month later he received the notification of “note completed.”

It didn’t say “case closed.” Only “completed.” To complete is not to finish; it is to make something traceable. And what is traceable can be reopened at any time.

He thought he would return to his previous position.

It didn’t happen.

The supervisor didn’t mention the matter. The next day, when he asked, he received a vague answer:

“The structure has already been adjusted. For now, stay here. There will be another evaluation.”

“There will be another evaluation” sounded like a corridor with no exit.

He began to pass by that street from time to time.

Not daily, but some afternoons, after work, he would detour and linger for a while at the corner. The construction had finished. The new asphalt was smooth. The balcony was empty.

The first time he saw it empty he wasn’t surprised. He simply confirmed that the pot had been removed.

He imagined several possibilities: thrown away, left on the street, discarded by a new occupant. All were reasonable. And what is reasonable rarely leaves a record.

He stood there for a moment and left.

On his way home he passed a flower shop. At the entrance there were new plants, with shiny leaves, freshly watered. The owner watered carefully; drops slid over the leaves. He stopped for a second, but didn’t go in.

He didn’t want to turn that into a symbol. He didn’t want to seek compensation in the everyday. He only felt a hard, non-negotiable certainty: some living things don’t remain because you’re careful. They are removed as easily as trash is removed. The world has no obligation to preserve your small gestures.

One day his card failed again.

This time it wasn’t the archive, but the building entrance. The guard looked at it and said:

“The system’s been updated. Your access is now only up to the third floor. To go higher you need authorization.”

“Why?” he asked.

The guard shrugged.

“That’s how it is in the system.”

He stood by the door with the card in his hand. He could ask for authorization, explain, ask for help. But for the first time he didn’t. He nodded and went down the stairs.

The staircase was narrow and poorly lit. On the fourth floor he heard the elevator, laughter, folders opening. That was the verification team. That was where he had been.

Now he was in the stairwell.

This is how a position in reality changes: not with collapses, but with new locks. You can still enter if someone helps you, but you no longer belong.

Months later, the supervisor called him again.

“There’s a vacancy,” he said. “Logistical support. We’re assigning you there.”

“Is it a promotion or a demotion?” he asked.

“It’s an adjustment.”

“Can I go back to the field?”

The supervisor was silent for a second.

“Now is not appropriate.”

He understood the answer. It wasn’t the cat, nor the soil, nor the plant. It was traceability. Once linked to a number, you become unstable. The system does not tolerate instability. It displaces it.

He nodded.

As he left, a former colleague greeted him:

“You don’t go out to the field anymore? They moved you inside?”

“Yes. Adjustment,” he replied.

The other didn’t ask more.

That night he took the old key out of the drawer.

It no longer worked. Even so, he held it for a moment, as if holding a severed connection. He opened the window. The wind moved the curtain. The sounds of the city came in and out like a tide.

He thought of something small: did that cat have a name?

He didn’t know. Maybe not. Deaths without names are easy to manage. But now it had a number, a file, a line next to his signature. A number is more cruel than a name, because a name belongs to a relationship; a number belongs to the system.

The next day he requested sick leave.

He didn’t go to work. He went to that street.

Not for the plant. It was gone. He just wanted to look at the building for a while. The yard had been cleaned. The soil leveled, uniform, like a smoothed page.

He stood there and left.

At the corner he saw a flower stand. There were cheap white flowers in plastic buckets. Their heads drooped, as if from lack of water. He didn’t buy any.

He understood he didn’t need to bring flowers home. They wouldn’t explain anything. They would only make him feel like he had made a gesture. And gestures belong to poetic prose, not to his life.

He kept walking.

Days later he received another email: he had to go to human resources to update his position and permissions.

He signed, placed his fingerprint, received a new card. The position was vaguer than before, a label designed to absorb people.

As he left he passed through the lobby. There were people handing over keys, signing, asking for everything to be done quickly. Phrases he had said many times. Now they sounded like a distant recording.

He stopped for a second.

He could go back, ask, complain, write an explanation longer than any form. But he didn’t.

He stepped out into the sun.

The light fell on the ground without intention. The street was full of hurried people. In the flower shop, new leaves gleamed and brushed against one another. They grew without effort.

And some things had died.

Just as easily.

He merged into the crowd, aware that he no longer occupied his former place. He had not been expelled or punished, only displaced, archived, placed where he could no longer make mistakes.

The system did not hate him.

The system had simply put him in the most appropriate place.

Like that cat buried in the soil, the soil transferred to a pot. The plant grew too well. Then it was removed, the soil emptied, everything clean, leaving no record.

He kept walking, without looking back.",1,1765661620.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

I have zero sense of spatial awareness and body coordination.

It keeps happening and I feel out of my mind and beyond irritated that I keep fucking up. 

I don’t even have energy and strength and lack of pain to clean up messes honestly.

No, I am not “just clumsy”. Quite the opposite historically. I have memories when I was healthy years pre-pandemic, I was sitting in the board room at work and we were doing a secret Santa and a bottle of wine slid down the shiny mahogany table and off the edge. I reached out quick with my right hand and caught that bottle of wine. Lifted it back onto the table. I have also previously played as a forward in basketball taking a lot of shots. I have also salsa danced to an intermediate level and coordinated my steps. I have done gymnastics as a child. I have done martial arts. I had good enough balance to be able to snowboard without falling. I used to have excellent body awareness & coordination.

I am also fucking tired of the medical gaslighting and  not just ignorance, but doctors deliberately ignoring my symptoms, especially now have flashbacks to the summer when the neurologist told me “overthinking is causing your symptoms” - I sure was not fucking even thinking about my coffee when I knocked it clean over. It’s now on the wall, bedside table and laminate floor, some in my fucking bedding. It happened faster than my brain could even catch on. In the past when these things happened, I at least saw part of it happening in the corner of my eye and had a faster response. Neuro ignored my cognitive impairment (test results in my fucking chart you bozo look at my fucking chart). Now I need documentation from assessments (I was blatantly refused due to being severely gaslit by doc) for disability income application. How on earth to be taken seriously to receive what I need. Please for the love of god no ssdi advice, I am not in America.

I also do stupid shit like burn my food and a nurse told me “just concentrate” - you don’t the fuck think I’m not trying??????! I have left the tap running before leaving the house for an appt. I have left the lights on in other rooms for days without realizing. I have accidentally cut myself trying to scrub a serrated knife clean (zero coordination). I have gotten lost in my own gd neighbourhood. But “young people are not allowed to be chronically ill & disabled” we are “supposed to have our shit together, working, making families, taking care of seniors, etc.” Zero space for nuance or other experiences.

Beside myself.

TLDR: Frustrated at my brain fog moments like spilling coffee repeatedly and other more hazardous examples. It is NOT in my control. I have lost complete control of my body. There is no quick fix pill for this. I am probably brain-damaged.",4,1765661535.0,covidlonghaulers,3,1.0,False
1plwlhh,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_EventNo9425/comments/1plwlhh/why_everything_feels_meh_lately_understanding_a/,Why Everything Feels Meh Lately: Understanding a Dopamine Crash (And How I Slowly Recovered),"For the last few months, I kept noticing this strange, heavy feeling settling over my days. The more I mentioned it to friends, the more I saw heads nodding in recognition.
It wasn’t sadness. It wasn’t really depression, and it didn’t feel like the frantic exhaustion of burnout.
It was just… flat.
Nothing felt exciting. Nothing felt particularly rewarding. Even the things I usually looked forward to—a good meal, a new episode of a show, a hobby—felt completely neutral.
My routine had become automatic. I’d wake up and scroll through my phone before my feet even touched the floor. I’d work with one eye on my notifications. I’d eat lunch while watching a video I didn’t care about. By 2:00 PM, I felt mentally drained, even if I hadn’t done anything difficult.
For a long time, I beat myself up about it. I thought I had just become lazy or lost my spark.
But eventually, I realized it wasn’t a personality flaw. I was experiencing a dopamine baseline crash.
What that ""flatness"" actually means
When we talk about dopamine, we usually think about rush and motivation. But we forget that dopamine also sets our baseline—it’s the background hum that determines how alive and engaged we feel on a normal Tuesday.
When that baseline drops, life loses its color.
I recognized the signs in myself only after I stopped ignoring them. Tasks felt physically painful to start. My focus would evaporate after five minutes. I found myself scrolling through feeds even when I was bored by the content, just because my brain felt too noisy to sit in silence.
I wasn’t undisciplined. I was just severely overstimulated.
The trap of modern noise
It makes sense when you look at how we’re living. In the past, that feeling of reward came from effort—walking somewhere, fixing a problem, finishing a long conversation, learning something difficult.
Now, we get hit with cheap spikes of dopamine all day long. Infinite scrolling, 15-second videos, the constant ping of notifications, multitasking.
Our brains are adaptable. When we flood them with easy rewards, they adjust. What used to feel exciting becomes just ""normal."" And what used to be normal—like reading a book or sitting in a quiet room—starts to feel agonizingly boring.
That’s how the baseline crashes. That’s why everything feels “meh.”
Why I stopped trying to ""detox""
When I first realized this, my instinct was to go to the extreme. I tried the trendy ""dopamine detox."" I told myself I wouldn’t look at a screen for 24 hours, or I’d delete all my apps.
It worked for about a day. Then the rebound hit, and I binged on digital content harder than before.
I realized that dopamine isn’t a toxin you flush out. You need it to function. The goal shouldn’t be to starve your brain; it should be to balance it.
So, I stopped trying to be perfect. I started making slow, imperfect changes to lower the volume of my life.
The slow, quiet changes that actually worked
I didn't use willpower. I just tried to lower the stimulation, bit by bit.
I removed the easiest spikes first.
I didn’t throw my phone in a lake. I just turned off the notifications that didn't matter. Then, a week later, I made a rule: no short videos before the sun goes down. Eventually, I started leaving my phone in the other room when I needed to write. I told myself, “I don’t need to be a monk, I just need to be a little less plugged in than yesterday.” That took the pressure off.
I relearned how to be bored.
This was the hardest part. When I stood in line at the grocery store or waited for the coffee pot to brew, my hand twitched toward my pocket. I had to consciously stop myself and just... stand there. It felt uncomfortable. My brain was screaming for input. But sitting in that boredom for ten minutes a day is where the recovery happened. That silence is where the baseline starts to rise again.
I swapped ""cheap"" dopamine for ""slow"" dopamine.
Cheap dopamine hits fast and fades instantly. Slow dopamine builds a sense of stability.
I started taking walks without headphones—just listening to the world. I cooked simple dinners without watching YouTube. I tried to do just one meaningful thing a day. Nothing dramatic, just real things that took a little bit of patience.
The other side of the noise
I didn’t turn into a productivity machine or a zen master. I’m still on my phone more than I should be.
But the difference in how I feel is real.
The static noise in my head has quieted down. My focus comes back easier now. The urge to scroll is there, but it’s not a compulsion I can't control. Mornings feel calmer. And most importantly, simple things—a conversation, a cup of coffee, a chapter of a book—actually feel enjoyable again.
If you’re feeling that flatness right now, please know: You aren’t broken. You aren’t lazy. You are just overstimulated in a world designed to keep you that way.
Your brain knows how to recover. You don’t need to force it. Sometimes, the most powerful thing you can do isn’t to try harder, but to just turn down the noise.

And i asked him how he can use the first 15 minutes of a catch up 3 years ago, as a fair tester when someone had literally broken up with the man they were going to marry because they cheated on them and obviously devestated. He said the other things have been good since then so idk why he wants let that first 15 minutes dictate. 

1.Can you change a guys mind?
2. Would kissing him if the vibes are there (like the last 2 times) reset that assumption?
3. He says he is living with adhd. I want to support him well in the way he receives it, and just recently in August I've realised over the past 3 years I've fallen in love with him. Is there any behaviours of mine that i could tailor to show any poorly informed assumptions arent widely true?

I knew a guy (D) as an aquintance 9 years ago now. 3 years ago he hit me up for career advice. We had a good chat. I broke up with my very serious boyfriend (cheated and took my money). 2 days later (D) drove 45 minutes over to the ocean to visit me for 6 hrs to talk me through it, i was devastated. I really didnt know him before that day so that was a huge effort for someone i had barely talked to beforehand.

Since then weve caught up after other break ups etc. Always buys me coffee, asks for hugs and holds me there, drives 45 minutes to move two pots, watches me from afar, blushes, giggles, wispers in my ears jokes, tells me im beautiful, remembers fine details of things and makes jokes abt it later. Is very protective of me when we are out together(i.e.protects my bare feet at the beach). He tells me he thinks im attractive. We have the same foundational views.

Last two catch ups have been quite nice, not done because of a recent prior bad event,theyve been fun, hes relaxed a bit, laughed a lot with his head back, and been very postively reactive to hugs, and light physical touch then ever before. Hes also told me his deepest darkest secret he hasnt told anyone else.

1plw8u5,https://i.redd.it/f738ejhbf17g1.png,UPDATE: I built BetterShift - A Modern Self-Hosted Shift Management App 📅,"Hey everyone! I wanted to share a project I've been working on called BetterShift - a free, open-source shift management application for anyone dealing with variable work schedules.

# What is it?

BetterShift is a Next.js-based web app that helps you organize work shifts across multiple calendars. It's designed to be self-hosted, keeps all your data local, and works great whether you're managing your own shifts or coordinating schedules for a team.

**🔗 Live Demo:** [GitHub Quick Links](https://github.com/panteLx/BetterShift?tab=readme-ov-file#-quick-links)

# Key Features

**📅 Smart Calendar Management**

* Create unlimited calendars with custom colors for different jobs/people
* One-click shift toggling - just click a day to add/remove shifts
* Right-click any day to add notes (e.g., ""Early shift for appointment"")
* Subscribe to external calendars (Google, Outlook, iCal) with auto-sync
* Real-time sync notification center

**🎨 Customization**

* Build reusable shift presets with custom times and colors
* Auto-save new shifts as templates for future use
* Quick preset switching for different shift patterns
* Visual color-coding for instant recognition

**🔒 Privacy & Security**

* Password-protect individual calendars
* Per-calendar access control

**🌍 Multi-Language**

* Full German, English, and Italian support
* Auto-detects browser language

**📊 Analytics**

* Track total hours worked with flexible time periods
* Real-time statistics that update instantly
* Custom date range analysis

**⚡ Live Updates**

* Server-Sent Events (SSE) for instant cross-tab sync
* Changes appear immediately across all browser tabs
* Automatic update notifications with changelog

**🎨 Modern UX**

* Dark/light theme with system preference detection
* Responsive design for desktop and mobile
* Smooth skeleton loading states

# Tech Stack

Built with modern web technologies:

* Next.js 16 + React 19 (App Router)
* SQLite + Drizzle ORM
* Tailwind CSS 4 + shadcn/ui
* Docker ready for easy deployment

# Why I Built This

I needed a simple way to track my variable work schedule across multiple part-time jobs, but existing solutions were either too complex, cloud-based (behind paywalls), or lacked features like external calendar sync and password protection. So I built BetterShift to be:

* **Privacy-first** \- Your data stays on your server
* **Simple** \- Clean UI, one-click operations
* **Flexible** \- Multiple calendars, custom presets, notes
* **Modern** \- Real-time updates, responsive design

# Open Source & Community

The project is MIT licensed and completely open source. I've set up a Discord community for support and discussions, and contributions are welcome!

* **Live Demo:** [GitHub Quick Links](https://github.com/panteLx/BetterShift?tab=readme-ov-file#-quick-links)
* **GitHub:** [github.com/pantelx/bettershift](https://github.com/pantelx/bettershift)
* **Discord:** [Join our community](https://discord.gg/Ma4SnagqwE)

If you find it useful, consider starring the repo or supporting the project on [Buy Me A Coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/pantel) or [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/pantelx) \- it really helps with motivation and server costs!

Hey everyone. I am putting myself out there to meet new people and hopefully build some easy, genuine connections. I am mainly looking for friendship to start. Good conversations, shared interests, someone to laugh with and feel comfortable around. If things naturally grow into something more, I am definitely open to that as well.

A little about me:
I am 33, born and raised in Michigan. I enjoy anything outdoors during the warmer months. Hiking, kayaking, camping, random day trips, bonfires, and pretty much anything that gets me outside. Once winter arrives, I switch into a more relaxed, at home mode. I enjoy reading, watching good shows, drinking coffee, and just enjoying calm nights in with the right person.

Personality wise, I am friendly, laid back, and easy to talk to. Once I am comfortable with someone, I can be silly, sarcastic, and playful. I love to laugh and I enjoy people who do the same. I appreciate genuine and consistent communication without anything forced or awkward. Just two people getting to know each other at their own pace.

What I am hoping to find:
Someone who wants to talk, share stories, joke around, and build something real. Whether it becomes a solid friendship or turns into something deeper, I am open to either. I am not expecting anything instantly. I just want good energy and a natural connection with someone who is also looking for something meaningful.

If any of this sounds like your style, feel free to reach out and tell me a little about yourself. I am always open to a conversation.",1,1765660462.0,cf4cf,0,1.0,False

I decided to walk half a lap to reset my HR and go for a reduced pace, (based on the assumption that running near max hr for this drill is not the intended training effect). After resuming, my pace was slower but my HR just redlined again.

Now let me provide context, 4 or 5 days ago I ran for 7 miles at an 8:30 pace with avg hr of 145 and I felt awesome…. I understand this is not an apples to apples comparison but rather an example of feeling really good about where I’m at but today feeling pretty disappointed. I slept well last night, felt light and loose when I woke up and before I ran I ate toast with butter and coffee. 

Here’s some pictures/stats from today’s run and my 7mi from a few days ago.

I really need some advice on this and I’m just looking for an outside perspective because I really don’t know if I’m overreacting and being selfish. 

So my husband and I got married about 7 months ago. We were engaged for two years and that time was amazing. We would go out on dates, out to eat, do activities etc and he never complained. But now that we’re married he just almost dreads going out. And it’s not like I’m asking to do anything crazy like partying or traveling. I just want to simple things like going out to eat, grab coffee, or just do something fun. Literally anything outside the house. The only time we go out is to run errands together, visiting family,  or to go to the movie theaters but that’s all we do. 

Most of the time he just wants to stay home and watch TV. He says he’s tired, doesn’t want to spend money, or he’s comfortable at home. Mind you he works from home casually and comfortably and I go to school almost everyday for like 4-6 hours, and then come home to cook and clean. 

I understand that staying in is comfortable because I’m also a homebody and I don’t expect to go out all the time, you know. But it just feels like I’m always the one who’s asking and he always says “maybe later” or “when time is due.” I also told him if we do something nice once a month I’ll never bother him again about this. On my end it’s really frustrating because it makes me feel like I’m begging for something. 

And don’t get me wrong, I love him and I’m very grateful for him. He pays for everything I need and he’s such a supportive and kind husband. I can’t picture myself without him. What’s hard is that I start to almost feel guilty for asking him these things, like am I asking for too much? I don’t want to nag him or force him. But it just makes me question our relationship and myself as well, which I hate to admit. It just makes me feel unwanted, or unimportant even though I know that might not be his intention. It just feels like everything is a chore for him and he just dreads it all. I just want to feel that spark again from when we were engaged. I feel like us not going out takes it away. 

I’ve spoken to him about this a couple of times and he just listens and says he understands, but nothing changes. I feel so annoying bringing this up to him and asking to go out. 

Am I being selfish or ungrateful? Am I the problem? Do I just accept it? Has anyone dealt with something similar? ",4,1765659936.0,Marriage,7,0.83,False

My significant other and I are planning a move within the next year and are hoping to get honest, lived-in insight from people who actually live in (or have spent significant time in) the places we’re considering.

We’re not looking for a “perfect” town — just a place that genuinely aligns with our lifestyle and values.

**A couple notes up front, just for clarity:**

* We understand housing pressure and growth are real everywhere, so I’m kindly not looking for *“don’t move here, we’re full”* responses. Every place is growing, and we’re just trying to make a thoughtful, respectful decision like everyone else.
* We also understand that coffee and tattoo apprenticeships aren’t high-paying paths — that’s okay with us. We value experience, quality of life, and creative growth over maximizing income.

What we’re looking for:

* Population under \~50k or a small town near a larger city
* Walkable or charming downtown
* Strong coffee scene (non-chain; I work in specialty coffee full-time)
* Artsy / creative / holistic / open-minded community
* Surrounded by nature (mountains, forests, rivers, trails, water, etc.)
* Farmers markets or healthier grocery options
* Younger or mixed creative demographic
* Max rent around $1,200
* Cannabis / hemp-derived D9 friendly (or at least not hostile)
* Tattoo access: my partner is pursuing an American Traditional tattoo apprenticeship — the town itself doesn’t need a scene, but it must be near a city with multiple shops and real apprenticeship opportunities

We’re not corporate or 9-to-5 people — we’re creatives and service-based workers (coffee, wellness, nutrition).

Towns we’re currently considering:

**OFFICIAL TOP LIST**

* Black Mountain, NC
* Weaverville, NC (near Asheville)
* Brevard, NC
* Staunton, VA
* Sylva, NC
* Boone, NC
* Roanoke, VA
* Athens, GA - might be too big (smaller towns around it)?
* Johnson City / Jonesborough, TN
* Hot Springs, AR

**SECOND-TIER LIST**

* Waynesville, NC
* Blacksburg / Christiansburg, VA
* Prescott, AZ
* Abingdon, VA

**Third-Tier List:**

* Missoula, MT
* Payson, AZ
* Springville, UT
* Carrboro, NC
* Marquette, MI
* Decorah, IA

* How is the jobs, quality, community?
* Does it feel welcoming to creatives/newcomers?

* Any red flags you’d want someone to know before moving?
* If you moved there excited — did reality match expectations?

Growing up, my most horrible memories are from the holidays. My mom would scream at me if I broke anything and would say the most horrible things about how clumsy, or selfish I was for knocking something over in her hoarder house. If we didn't help decorate, we hated her. If we did help, we were doing it wrong. One time she was in the middle of a tantrum and started hitting my dad and he pushed her away...

Hi! My name is Stephanie! I’m 35 and live in Western Canada (Specifically - Alberta). I am hoping to make a new online friend that is fun/funny, genuine, willing/able to put effort into conversations(I will do the same!). I would prefer to chat with people around my age, or older(please no one under 30!), that is able to text/write full words lol - a bit of slang is cool, but I can’t do the whole “u” instead of “you” thing etc all the time! 

Some things I enjoy that could give an idea if we have interests in common, or just to start a conversation: music! My favorite band is blink 182, and has been since I was 14 - also pretty into Alkaline Trio, mgk, Taylor Swift etc etc. I enjoy shopping and getting my nails done - I see a very talented nail tech that makes all my nail art dreams a reality. I love coffee, movie and tv shows, with a preference for anything horror. I love to exercise daily, and love to go for long walks. Other things too, but I don’t want to give everything away here, or make this intro too long. 

If this interests you and you’d like to have a chat, please send me a message and introduce yourself !

**How to JUST froth milk (or make hot chocolate) on a Magnifica Evo**


I searched for this answer and found it rather difficult to find so after wading through many wrong answers so I am returning here with the correct answer to this question.  


If you want to JUST froth on the Evo, one of your coffee compartments needs to be empty. Hopefully you’re not a psycho using this machine for ground coffee so if that’s the case this is what you do: 



* Fill your milk container with your desired type and amount of milk. 


* On the machine menu where you select either ground beans or pre-ground coffee, select the button for pre-ground. Again, that compartment has to be empty. 


* Click the latte button. Your machine will pour steamed milk. Once it completes, your machine will error because there is no coffee in the compartment but the error clears quickly.

I’ve made a few posts over the past weeks about meeting people, and every comment or DM has reminded me how many of us are looking for the same thing: connection, warmth, and people to share life with.

I’m 26F, study online, and moved here not too long ago. Starting over socially in your mid-20s can feel surprisingly hard — especially as routines settle in and the weather gets colder. A lot of us want to go to events, try new things, or put ourselves out there, but it’s harder when you don’t have someone to go with, or you’re not sure where to start or the weather is complicated.

Because there’s been real interest, I’ve been taking the time to give this some structure instead of rushing it. The goal is to create spaces where it’s easier to meet people and make friends by building small community groups around shared interests, encouraging interaction, and helping friendships grow in a cozy, natural way.

Some of the activities we’ll have include:

✨ board game nights

✨ coffee hangouts & winter walks

✨ movie nights & themed nights

✨ holiday baking or cooking

✨ gift exchanges & crafts

✨ gym sessions or exercising together

✨ and simply spending time together and talking

And if there’s something you would love to do. Your idea is totally welcome. This is something we’ll build together.

This isn’t about big events or numbers. It’s about doing activities, supporting each other, and making it a little easier to show up when we’re all in the same boat. A reminder that we don’t have to do everything alone.

I’ve already reached out to the people who have messaged me so far. If I somehow missed you, Reddit sometimes hides messages — so please feel free to comment or DM me again. And if you’re new, you’re very welcome too.

To keep things organized and make sure everyone is real (and not bots), the next step will be simple:
I’ll send a short form with basic info, then share links to a Discord group and an Instagram page. I’ll also share more details there about upcoming activities, so we don’t saturate Reddit and once everything is set, I’ll make another post with the social links as well.

And if you’re reading this and thinking, “I could really use some friends too”… me too.
Even if all you want right now is someone to talk to, I’m here.

Drop a comment or DM me if you’d like to join or just chat. I’ll be very active on this so we can start off on the same page.

Let’s make this winter feel a little softer, a little brighter, and a little less lonely together 💛🎁",9,1765659395.0,IowaCity,9,0.85,False

1plvp6g,https://www.reddit.com/r/pmp/comments/1plvp6g/passed_in_under_a_month_of_study/,Passed in under a month of study,"TL;DR

* I enrolled in the 35-hour PMP course on November 13th.
* Completed it in a week.
* Spent the next three weeks studying, taking practice tests, and documenting my project history for PMI. 
* Survived a surprise application audit. 
* Sat for the exam on December 9th. 
* And I’m happy to say, on December 10th, I was notified that I passed the exam.

It has been a whirlwind, but I’m really glad I did it. Not only because of the credential, but because the process helped me reflect on the parts of project management I really enjoy, like cross-functional alignment, supporting teams through complex initiatives, and working with motivated stakeholders.

Here are the details:

1. I watched AR’s videos at 2x speed and used Notion AI to transcribe the videos and summarize notes. I did this while walking on the treadmill. I found this to be a highly effective way to exercise, learn, and produce summary notes. I didn’t wind up using most of the notes aside from an initial read after finishing each video. I did reread a few of them while studying, but it was more of a protective measure to make sure I had notes to refer to if needed.
2. I read AR’s book and PMBOK 6 and 7 on the weekends while at the beach. I did not finish any of them. This was to bolster the video eduction and alleviate any potential sense of guilt for enjoying myself rather than studying.
3. After completing the 35 hour course, I immediately applied to sit for the exam. I fed ChatGPT high-level info on each project, and let it go to work filling in some of the details after ensuring that it understood the format PMI wants the submissions to be in. 10 minutes after submitting my application, I received an email notifying me that my application was randomly flagged for audit.
4. I immediately submitted references to PMI and contacted my references letting them know they’ll be receiving an email from PMI asking them to validate my experience. All of my references submitted their confirmation of my experience within 24-hours.
5. After PMI confirmed my ability to sit for the exam, I purchased Study Hall. I immediately turned off “auto-renew.” It wasn’t going to take me that long to pass, and I didn’t want to get hit with a second charge in February.
6. Study Hall was a must have for me. I would go through roughly 150-200 questions per day. I’d didn’t focus so much on any one category. I just wanted to get the reps in. Any question I got wrong, I would make sure to read the full explanation of the answer. Any questions I got right, I would move forward without reading the explanation of the answer. I averaged 75% on practice quizzes. Some were 100%. Some were 50%. Most were around 75%,
7. On Friday December 5th I scheduled the exam for the following Tuesday.
8. I purchased the Third Rock PDF notes and cheat sheet, went to Office Depot, and had them printed and bound.
9. I read the notes and cheat sheet once Friday afternoon and took my first full length exam from Study Hall around 6pm. I finished at 9:30pm with a 77%.
10. Saturday and Sunday, I went to all day art fairs. I got home around 6pm each day, reread the Third Rock cheatsheet, and worked through more quizzes.
11. Monday, I took my send full length exam from Study Hall. I thought I failed this one, but I got 82%.
12. Tuesday, I woke up at 8am, made a coffee, made a second coffee, and got to my computer early at 8:45am for my 9:15am exam. I was on a Mac with a massive 27 inch monitor. This was a problem. The Vue software is a full screen takeover, which extends text almost across the entire screen. This does not make for good readability. The highlight and strike through hot keys do not work on Mac. I spent the first five minutes trying to troubleshoot this with the proctor. They were not able to help and endlessly said, “good luck on your exam.” I finished the first 60 questions in 60 minutes. I finished the next 60 questions in 75 minutes, leaving 45 minutes to finish the final 60 questions. This was not a good place to be. I was burning time reading across the 27 inch monitor, moving my mouse to the very lower right hand corner to click the “next” button, and moving my eyes off the words I was reading to click the highlight or strike through buttons. It doesn’t seem like much, but when you’re going through 180 questions, it adds up. I decided to speed through whatever remaining questions I could. No highlight. No strike through. Skim for high level detail and make my best guess after reading the possible answers once. Any remaining drag and drop or calculation questions (of which there were five in the last 60 questions) I skipped. I ended the exam only completing 170 (including those on skipped) of the 180 total questions when time ran out.
13. I spent the next 24 hours picking my parents from the airport (they are staying with me over the holidays), playing video games, relaxing, and trying to distract myself from the thought of having to retake the exam. I was confident I failed, but resolved to use it as a learning experience to better manage my time in the next go.

The day after taking the exam, I was on a walk with my mother telling her how badly I wanted to pass when I saw an email on my phone. The subject read “Congratulations, you have obtained a PMP®”

I was elated. After checking my score, I saw that I got BT on process and AT on people and business environment. Could I have been more prepared? Yes. Did I want to spend 6 months to a year preparing for the exam? Absolutely not.

My thought was, it’s better to fail fast and try again than to be over prepared. Thankfully, I don’t have to try again. The best part is, I actually enjoyed the process and look forward to my next certification. The continuing education requirements are designed in a way that I only makes sense to use the hours for additional certs.

Looking back, the only thing I wish I would have done differently is to use a PC laptop. That would have ensured I was reading on an appropriately sized screen and that hot keys were functioning properly.

P.S. As far as the exam went, while some report that it’s similar to Study Hall, I found Study Hall to be far easier. The exam questions were overwritten and occasionally convoluted. Study Hall doesn’t provide any drag and drop questions. At least, not that I could find. I had eight total drag and drop questions on the exam.",6,1765659102.0,pmp,3,1.0,False

Hope you're all doing amazing! 
I am aware that the sample above does not tell much about the actual plot, yet I wished to include it as an example of my writing (I can write more, depending on the situation in the roleplay itself ;).

But Frog, you may ask, what is this roleplay even about? Well, let me tell you:
Zofia, a 19 year old daughter of a financially-struggling family, is sent to work as a maid in a noble household, somewhere distant. My main goal for this roleplay is to explore how her new life would look like, everyday chores and challenges that her occupation brings, relations between her coworkers (both camaraderie and conflict) and other members of the household as well as perhaps events happening in the town they’d live in. It's a simple premise, but one that gives us so many possibilities! I'd love to hear your ideas as well ^^

A bunch of extra details:
- *Please know that even though I am looking for someone to GM this story, I’ll contribute as much as you wish. Be it brainstorming, playing some side characters, you name it. As someone who knows how it is to GM, I wish for you to enjoy the roleplay as well (＾-＾)*
- *While this roleplay is meant to be wholesome and cozy, there will be some more somber tones from time to time.*
- *Brainstorming and worldbuilding! Whether we decide to place it in our real world Victorian era, or perhaps a fictional setting, I’d appreciate it if we dedicated some time to setting up the plot, adjusting it and tailoring to our wants, deciding on the core themes as well as worldbuilding (the household, for example).*
- I’d love to capture the aesthetics of manga/anime, even with the ways we’d write our roleplay. Some exaggeration, tropes and so one are very welcome :D
- *I am open to romance, although only between two women ^^” I don’t mind it being a sizable part of our story, however, I don’t want it to overshadow everything else, nor feel rushed.*

(I'd also be open to a similar roleplay set in a nun convent or a mental asylum (a bit of a dream ^^"") as well!)

(An anime-style, Victorian maid story)","*“19th of October, 1885” The blank page was occupied solely by this singular piece of rather untidy handwriting placed at the top right corner. What would follow remained a mystery, even for the hands supposedly recounting events and noting emotions. Not from the lack of meaningful points to elaborate on, but rather the opposite.*

*Having sunk into the realm of her thoughts, Zofia would take her eyes off the notebook resting on her lap and gaze outside, at the rows upon rows of trees making up deep, uncharted forests she was passing by. Her head leaned against the window, feeling vibrations emanating from the train, getting lost in the clutter of its countless wheels. Ah, so many uncertainties, so many doubts. She felt the weight of her family’s issues on her shoulders, even if only partially.*

*“Maybe it’s not going to be that bad?” She thought to herself, glancing for a moment at an old suitcase she placed beside herself. “But when will I get to see them again? In months?” A sigh followed, a futile attempt at dispersing worries. Soon enough her new life would begin, yet what will it bring?*

**Greetings, everyone!**

Hope you're all doing amazing! 
I am aware that the sample above does not tell much about the actual plot, yet I wished to include it as an example of my writing (I can write more, depending on the situation in the roleplay itself ;).

But Frog, you may ask, what is this roleplay even about? Well, let me tell you:
Zofia, a 19 year old daughter of a financially-struggling family, is sent to work as a maid in a noble household, somewhere distant. My main goal for this roleplay is to explore how her new life would look like, everyday chores and challenges that her occupation brings, relations between her coworkers (both camaraderie and conflict) and other members of the household as well as perhaps events happening in the town they’d live in. It's a simple premise, but one that gives us so many possibilities! I'd love to hear your ideas as well ^^

A bunch of extra details:
- *Please know that even though I am looking for someone to GM this story, I’ll contribute as much as you wish. Be it brainstorming, playing some side characters, you name it. As someone who knows how it is to GM, I wish for you to enjoy the roleplay as well (＾-＾)*
- *While this roleplay is meant to be wholesome and cozy, there will be some more somber tones from time to time.*
- *Brainstorming and worldbuilding! Whether we decide to place it in our real world Victorian era, or perhaps a fictional setting, I’d appreciate it if we dedicated some time to setting up the plot, adjusting it and tailoring to our wants, deciding on the core themes as well as worldbuilding (the household, for example).*
- I’d love to capture the aesthetics of manga/anime, even with the ways we’d write our roleplay. Some exaggeration, tropes and so one are very welcome :D
- *I am open to romance, although only between two women ^^” I don’t mind it being a sizable part of our story, however, I don’t want it to overshadow everything else, nor feel rushed.*

(I'd also be open to a similar roleplay set in a nun convent or a mental asylum (a bit of a dream ^^"") as well!)

Why hello! I shall introduce myself a bit, so that you also know who you’re dealing with. You may call me Frog. I’m a passionate, 18+ roleplayer from CET/GMT +1 timezone. However, I do not think those pose any obstacle in terms of writing, so don’t be deterred by that even if you’re from a completely different part of our space-roaming disc silly autocorrect, I meant globe :P. Besides that, I don’t have much to share about me, I reckon. I love cats though, that’s worth a mention!

The [X4Y] tag does reflect the gender of my characters, not my own. I prefer not sharing it. I hope you’ll understand <3

It makes me angry that this is what 'work' is becoming: sitting on your behind, pretending to do work. I'll take 10 hours of that compared to 2 hours of heavy labouring. Anyone would. And people with these jobs are all proud of themselves and how 'hard' they're working. And they even have the balls to be proud of working so many hours. UK is becoming a country of office drones. Anyone who has a blue collar job like a cleaner, road sweeper, brickie, mechanic, plumber, are treated like absolute shit.

First hand, when I worked as a cleaner in the offices of a theatre company, they talk to me and other cleaners (when they weren't avoiding us) like we were mentally handicapped. They'd take pictures of wet floors to send to my supervisor without informing me, and would do absolutely fuck all. Seriously, most of them spend their times making coffee and crying because someone used their labelled soy milk, or watching David Attenborough documentaries, or having loud conversations with co-workers. How the other half live. And that's work? 

They seemed disgusted to be in my presence, and if I bumped into actors who were in the theatre production that day, they'd seem uncomfortable even being close to a cleaner. It's humiliating. People have no idea how lucky they are to have those jobs.

What it does:

\- Email forwarding for receipts

\- Warranty expiration reminders

\- Manual PDF uploads

\- Simple dashboard

\- Free tier (10 receipts), optional paid upgrade

Después de dos EPs brillantes, los asturianos debutan con este LP de punk con toques británicos, mezclado con noise. Bajos y baterías machacones, guitarras sucias, voces que transmiten mala leche y ritmos adictivos como “Viene y va”, con la que arranca el álbum, “Olvidé” o “Cuadro”, con crescendo magníficos, y “Cuerpo en llamas”, que da nombre al disco. Pero no todo es mala hostia, ya que la banda también experimenta con otros géneros en “Reina de ruinas”, con la que cierran el trabajo.

29. [destellos\* – Todo, un incendio nada](https://destellosmo5.bandcamp.com/album/todo-un-incendio-nada)

El LP debut de destellos\* es súper interesante. Instrumentales cuidadas donde se mezclan art-rock y emo, y letras que hablan de amor y rupturas, desde la crudeza inicial de “Eng Bunker” hasta la sensibilidad de “Hoy no estoy para nadie” a dos voces, o ese dúo de baladas formado por “Todo se mantiene igual / Nada se mantiene igual”, donde juegan con el lo-fi. También destaca “No era esto a lo que veníamos”. En conjunto, es una combinación de poesía y potencia que se cierra con la maravillosa “Cruel”, que recuerda a ciertas bandas de los 90. Un disco que habla de lo que queda, de lo que duele y de lo que arde.

28. [Boneflower – Reveries](https://boneflower.bandcamp.com/album/reveries-2)

Después de A(r)mour que me pareció un discazo y el pedazo EP de Dolor /遠来, vuelven con un álbum que incluye colaboraciones con gente de Touché Amoré en la maravillosa “Pomegranate”, instrumentales que suenan de miedo como “I Gazed At The Starred Night All Alone And Blood Tasted Like Honey In My Mouth, Lethargic”(para mí la mejor del disco), y temones como “Coup de Grâce” o “Sad Bird”, que a mí me han gustado bastante. No apto si no te gustan los gritos.

27. [Lontras –Caras no lume](https://raso.bandcamp.com/album/lontras-caras-no-lume)

Para mí el disco galego del 2025. Un debut que me ha flipado donde se mezclan folk, indie, y electrónica, con una voz maravillosa y unasensibilidadque brilla en canciones como esa “Presaxios” que abre el disco, “Neve e luz”, y “O principio de incerteza”. Qué bueno que sigan saliendo propuestas así desde Galicia.

26. [Gazella – Vías](https://foehnrecords.bandcamp.com/album/gazella-v-as)

Segundo trabajo de Gazella, tras un debut ya muy interesante. Un disco de voces etéreas en el que se dibujan paisajes, con una música que transmite delicadeza entre guitarras y electrónica. Rozan el ambient en “AL2”, el post-punk y el folk en “Aracea” o el stoner rock psicodélico en “Un lugar”. Mucha gente lo ha incluido en sus listas y creo que pocas veces he estado tan de acuerdo.

25. [FUET! – Make It Happen](https://estudiomazmorra.bandcamp.com/album/make-it-happen-album)

El debut de FUET! trae ese hardcore con tintes americanos a España. Un álbum que ya esperábamos bueno tras escuchar los singles, con temarrales como “Green Lights”, “Fo’ Sho’” o “Glowing”. El disco incluye otros temas igual de potentes como “KITKAT” o “THINK THINK THINK”, bajando las revoluciones en canciones como “Doomed”. Todo el mundo me ha dicho que su directo es increíble; hay muchas ganas de verlos.

24. [Ku! – Ku!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0JCMSZ493c&list=OLAK5uy_nUMoGa1Q9MlzIPvsBmpIM3xkbwJdgtDp4)

Un disco al que no sé muy bien cómo llegué, pero que se me acabó haciendo súper divertido de escuchar. Desde los primeros acordes de “Txan Txan” entras de lleno en el universo de la banda. Continúan con “Rápido”, que tiene tintes egg-punk en algunos momentos, con un ritmo pegadísimo que te deja bailando. El álbum sigue con canciones de aire veraniego como “Calor”, “Michael” o la increíble versión de Luis Miguel (y Michael Jackson) “No culpes (Será que no me amas)”, para terminar con tonos más post-punk en “Botas de cuero”. Muy buena sorpresa y fichaje acertadísimo de Candorro.

23. [Los Chivatos – Pulpa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2SaBqNKaUk&list=RDV2SaBqNKaUk&start_radio=1)

Los Chivatos regresan con un disco que mantiene el formato que los ha hecho tan reconocibles: instrumentales con guitarras contundentes, letras memorables llenas de frases para el recuerdo y un estilo muy propio. El álbum arranca, tras la intro, con un cuarteto de temazos: “Tron”, “Desplázate y corre”, “Seagull” y “Citroen AX”. Las letras dan un paso adelante y miran tanto al pasado y la nostalgia como a los tiempos actuales, el turbocapitalismo o los conspiranoicos, sin dejar de apelar a lo nostálgico en temas como “Club Zed” o “Rayo”. Para mí, es el mejor trabajo que han publicado hasta la fecha: más profundidad sin perder identidad. Invertid en bonos del Estado, hacedme caso.

22. [La Plata – Interzona](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzEFgXBY7-o&list=OLAK5uy_nUENjp0EtQZE56N8UL8dzJgHUwMZgM-F8)

La Plata siguen a su bola después del EP Sueños y continúan desarrollando el cambio de sonido que ya habían marcado. En lugar de estancarse e intentar repetir su primer álbum, aquí encontramos canciones a dos voces muy memorables como “cerca de ti” o “mirar atrás”. Siguen apareciendo ecos de sus primeros discos en temas como “música infinita” o la instrumental “5am”, junto a piezas más etéreas como “la vida real” o “agua clara”, donde canta María. A destacar también “ruido blanco”, con ese ritmo de breakbeat. Un disco que personalmente me ha encantado y que confirma que La Plata es una de las mejores bandas del país.

21. [Murina - Nueva Forma de Vida](https://murina.bandcamp.com/album/nueva-forma-de-vida)

Un trabajo editado por La Rubia Producciones, que siempre sacan cosas interesantes, de una banda con miembros de Italia y España. Llegué a él casi por casualidad y acabó flipándome. Grunge y cañonazos de rock que recuerdan a bandas como Mourn (especialmente en “Sugarfree”) o Bala, y mucho a Hole/Courtney Love o L7. Letras crudas en castellano e inglés que destilan rabia y emoción. Un disco muy noventero, con guitarras distorsionadas que suenan increíbles y canciones como “Nueva forma de mentira” o “Gattamorta”, donde la aspereza brilla con luz propia.

20. [Júlia Colom – Paradís](https://juliacolom.bandcamp.com/album/parad-s)

La voz de Júlia Colom es maravillosa y en este disco la combina con guitarras y electrónica, pasando por el pop en “Transformacions” junto a Ouineta o el folk, con colaboraciones de peso como Tarta Relena en “Sa Madona”. También hay canciones delicadas e íntimas como “Ja saps on m’amag” o “Juntes dins s’aigua”, además de pasajes más atmosféricos como “Més avall”, que cierra el álbum.

19. [Rufus T. Firefly – Todas las cosas buenas](https://rufustfirefly.bandcamp.com/album/todas-las-cosas-buenas)

Rufus vuelven después de ese maravilloso disco que fue “El largo mañana” con un sonido que recuerda a los álbumes que los catapultaron como “Loto” o “Magnolia”. Un disco con letras críticas con la industria musical y la competencia entre artistas como esa “Premios de la música independiente”, psicodelia Tameimpalesca en esa “Trueno Azul”, “Todas las cosas buenas” o “Camina a través del fuego”, o esa delicadeza que transmite “Canción de paz” que abre el disco. También experimentan con la electrónica en esa “ Dron sobrevolando Castilla-La Mancha”. Y hay canciones donde canta Julia como esa “Ceci n’est pas une pipe”. También experimentan con la electrónica en “Dron sobrevolando Castilla-La Mancha”, y hay canciones donde canta Julia, como “Ceci n’est pas une pipe”. Siguen demostrando que están entre lo mejor del panorama estatal, y además la idea de presentar el disco con conciertos donde el público escucha con cascos me parece una genialidad.

18. [Boys Kissing Boys - Derrotismo preventivo](https://boyskissingboys.bandcamp.com/album/derrotismo-preventivo)

No son Cala Vento ni Japandroids, pero el disco arranca fortísimo con “bien ke bien”. Continúan con varias canciones entre las que destaco “las escaleras, el sudor y el mar”, “21 de enero”, la maravillosa “vamos no me jodas” y ese cierre en Bandcamp que me parece de 10: “se ha escrito un crimen”. Emo con palillo en la boca y codo en la barra, como dicen ellos, con letras de amor y desamor, despedidas y frases que se te quedan grabadas, como ese “he perdido la cuenta de las canciones que podrían llevar tu nombre de las noches en nuestra ciudad”.

17. [Anna Andreu – Vigília](https://hiddentrackrecords.bandcamp.com/album/vig-lia)

A estas alturas a nadie debería sorprender que Anna Andreu saque un disco bueno. Ya sus dos trabajos anteriores eran excelentes (“La mida” fue un disco que me encantó en su momento), y vuelve con “Vigilia”, un disco donde mezcla el folk con el pop de guitarras y la electrónica. La belleza del álbum es abrumadora, desde la increíble “Mentrestant” hasta la más íntima “Sencera”, pasando por la preciosa “Roja i espessa”. La voz de Anna Andreu es impresionante y los arreglos transmiten emociones que consiguen conmoverte de verdad.

16. [julia amor – algo para regresar](https://juliamor.bandcamp.com/album/algo-para-regresar)

La andorrana julia amor saca su segundo disco después de ese “mi corazón” de 2023, que ya tenía cosas interesantes. Aquí da un paso adelante con nueve canciones donde su voz brilla como nunca y experimenta con autotune y distintos estilos. Un disco de synth-pop y dream pop que comienza con “hielo afilado”, un tema que se te queda en la cabeza, continúa con “armadura”, donde los sintetizadores entran con fuerza, y sigue creciendo en “buscando unos brazos”, con letras melancólicas sobre inseguridades y emociones. También hay espacio para guitarras con chip-tune en el genial final de “fino y transparente”, con ecos de j-pop, y una instrumental final, “hacia donde vuelan los patos”, que deja un cierre muy agradable.

15. [La Maria - Robina](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGvE6EpIUac)

El álbum de la valenciana se abre con la preciosa “Robina”, que da título al disco y va creciendo poco a poco, y continúa con “Qui s’ha inventat l’amor?”, donde entran los sintetizadores. El trabajo se estructura en tres partes: ruptura, vacío y enamoramiento, narradas con una voz espectacular que destaca especialmente en “Perla” o “Perdona María”, donde se mezclan folk y electrónica. En la recta final aparecen canciones más luminosas como “Havanera papallones”. Un disco que considero realmente hermoso con una calidad tremenda.

14. [Dharmacide – Tougher than the rest](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_mbWokVmJtd1wJuz1hPfZAvBjx8a9ddQyg)

Dharmacide es una de mis debilidades, su disco “Cult Band Member” allá por 2021 me pareció increíble y un maravilloso debut, y no han hecho más que crecer. En este disco vuelven con sus tonos shoegaze, quizás con menos tonos oscuros que en su anterior, aunque se mantienen en canciones como “The Cigs, The Light, The Coffee and Crying”, que tienen estribillos súper pegadizos. Hay también momentos de calma como en esa “Lonely” que te hace entrar en el disco relajado, ese “Time Goes By” que recuerda a The Brian Jonestown Massacre o esa maravillosa “Dove”, para acabar con esa etérea “If She Calls (Bach Again” para cerrar un disco de sobresaliente. Y en directo aún son mejores, vedlos si podéis.

13. [Podré tocar los dientes de la noche - Podré tocar los dientes de la noche](https://boyskissingboys.bandcamp.com/album/derrotismo-preventivo)

Un disco al que entré sin saber muy bien qué esperar y del que salí completamente impresionado. Especialmente recomendable si te gusta el género: café para muy cafeteros, no apto para quienes odian los gritos. Emoviolence con screamo, metalcore y post-hardcore, en definitiva, un trabajo muy oscuro. Las instrumentales son brutales y las letras abordan temas habituales en este tipo de música: muerte, sangre, vida y tristeza. Para mí, el mejor disco de screamo de este 2025.

12. [Garbí – Aquel intenso azul](https://garbi.bandcamp.com/album/aquel-intenso-azul-2)

Garbí han publicado, para mí, su mejor disco hasta la fecha y uno de los más interesantes de la escena emo estatal. Aunque su debut ya era muy bueno, aquí dan un paso adelante y se nutren mucho más de influencias japonesas, hasta el punto de cantar en japonés en canciones como “意味はない (imiwanai)”. El álbum mezcla post-hardcore, Shimokita-kei, emo, pop-punk y shoegaze, con letras sobre inseguridades, el paso del tiempo, los errores y el sentido de la vida. Más allá de “imiwanai”, temas como “Apagón”, “Kondo/ima”, “seguir sufriendo” o “meseta añil” brillan con luz propia. Es algo más largo de lo habitual en el género, pero merece totalmente la pena.

11. [Pony Pool Club – Pony Pool Club](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXE8M0KCJRQ&list=OLAK5uy_kpkYnyNLLCqdQoyWlvybfE6PNl7r42Evw)

Los adelantos que había escuchado de Pony Pool Club me habían dejado muy buen sabor de boca, y el disco completo no ha sido menos. Un debut muy sólido de esta banda sevillana, con un indie rock de sabor noventero, guitarras potentes, buenas voces y letras sobre amor y despedidas. Hay canciones preciosas como “Por qué es tan difícil” o “20 horas”, y una “Pipas” maravillosa que cierra el álbum, además de temas con toques más grunge como “Vas a marcharte”. Estoy convencido de que en un par de años estarán en muchos sitios; suenan de miedo y todo apunta a que en directo ganan aún más.

10. [EZEZEZ – Kabakriba](https://ezezez.bandcamp.com/album/kabakriba)

Ya el primer disco de EZEZEZ había tenido buenas críticas y tenía cosas interesantes, pero en este disco se confirma que no fue casualidad. Después de escucharlo sientes como si una apisonadora te ha pasado por encima: el disco comienza con un trío de ases: “punto final”, “zorozelai” y “noraezean” con un punk rock con guitarras distorsionadas que recuerda a influencias británicas como IDLES o neoyorquinas como Parquet Courts. Pero en el disco también hay espacio para baladas como esa maravillosa “new york”, rock psicodélico como esa “hi pake”, o rock setentero como ese “kalekume”.

9. [CORTE! – Música para humanos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_nn-WoYLtVk614gNMS4CuFYvq_ewoAppoc)

Un disco que se me hizo súper entretenido para escuchar. Bases de sintetizadores, letras con críticas política y rabia contra el sistema, que hablan del mundo actual, relaciones personales y el paso del tiempo. La voz de Gonzalo es una de mis favoritas, y en este disco creo que hay un puñado de frases que merecen la pena, creo que cada canción tiene una frase destacable que sinceramente me parecen de lo mejor que he escuchado este 2025. Canciones que de ese post-punk más clásico en “Hay un niño atrapado dentro de una máquina” o “A ratos perdidos”, a casi house como en ese “Centro de gravedad” que van con la temática de la letra, al synth pop van descomo ese “Todavía es mañana”. Mi favorita de este disco es la de “Alegrías de la mala sangre” porque creo que en este 2025 no he visto una canción que empiece de una forma tan potente como esta.

8. [Mourn - Letra ligada](https://montgri.bandcamp.com/album/letra-ligada)

Mourn sacan un disco un año después de “The Avoider”, esta vez cantando íntegramente castellano. Canciones de paisajes cotidianos y sentimientos, con temas tan bonitos como “Alegre y Jovial”, “Burriac”, “Espejo latente”, donde canta Carla (una de mis favoritas del álbum), o “Letra ligada”, que le da título. El cambio de idioma les sienta genial y el disco desprende una luz que te contagia la felicidad que transmite. Siguen siendo las Mourn de siempre, pero más alegres.

7. [AMORE – Top Hits, Ballads, etc.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBUtr79GNJk&list=OLAK5uy_mM-nu9nTrxaUdwr8t07niEJo_JjuaAbHQ)

El debut de la murciana María Moreno es uno de los trabajos más interesantes del pop estatal reciente. Pop con tintes electrónicos en canciones como “Peléame!!!”, “Querió” o “I Gotta Feeling”, guitarras y voz en lo-fi en “Amiga”, baladas como “Last María on Earth”, pop más bailable en “Delirio” o momentos íntimos solo con piano y voz en “Infinity 2024”. El disco gira en torno al amor y el desamor, con una voz excelente, letras directas sin caer en tópicos, coros muy cuidados y unas instrumentales que a veces rozan el ambient. Tiene mucha personalidad y, aunque abraza sin complejos su lado pop, ofrece cosas muy interesantes. En los comentarios de algún vídeo de Youtube decían que era la Oklou murciana, y la verdad es que no me parece una mala comparación en absoluto.

6. [Nuevos Mundos – Nuevos Mundos](https://nuevosmundos.bandcamp.com/album/nuevos-mundos)

Un disco que vi por el subreddit hace tiempo y luego re-descubrí con Hipersónica, sólo para darme cuenta que ya lo había apuntado como uno de los discos a destacar este 2025. Voces algo rasgadas, y temas que van desde el noise rock en “Atasco M-30” con toques de psicodelia en “Entre Tú y Yo” o “Mi Linda Flor”.”. El álbum mantiene el nivel en todo momento, con el noise muy presente en canciones como “Si quieres saber” o “Cielo gris”. Un auténtico sorpresón y una incorporación muy interesante a la escena noise. Para mí, uno de los descubrimientos del año.

5.[ Saïm – Precipitacions](https://saimtheband.bandcamp.com/album/precipitacions)

Llegué a Saïm por la web de Bcore y escuché su disco y me dejó flipando de lo bueno que es. Es cierto que llevan ya una década tocando, pero yo he llegado a ellos ahora. Un rock con toques emo y post-hardcore que te deja moviendo la cabeza arriba y abajo y tarareando las canciones. Con un comienzo tan bueno con ese “Just assullà”, siguiendo con ese “Atzur” que ya te tiene dentro con los primeros acordes y ese “Extrasístole” que me parece una de las mejores del álbum. Pero no todo es caña, hay momentos de pausa como en esa “Precipitacions” donde suena el piano o esa “Punt.Final” como broche de oro para cerrar el disco. Ha sido de los pocos discos este 2025 que me ha dejado con la boca abierta y sólo por eso debería estar en mi top.

4. [Los Yolos – Volumen 3](https://losyolos.bandcamp.com/album/volumen-3)

Volumen 3 empieza con esa “NSPD” transmitiendo la paranoia que puedes tener, o esa “Tres menos cuarto”. Con letras que hablan de la turistificación masiva en su ciudad, Barcelona (“La Chicharra”), insegurididades y tristeza (“Príncipe entristecido”), y otras más festivas como esa “Tres Menos Cuarto”, para mí una de las mejores del disco, y otras de crítica política como esa “Demasiado HD”, culminando en ese grito de llamada a la acción “Shack Shack”. Todo esto bajo un garage postpunkero, con guitarras y bajos adictivos.

3. [Nogato – Lo que he ganado, lo que he perdido](https://nogato.bandcamp.com/album/lo-que-he-ganado-lo-que-he-perdido)

Nogato tienen una importancia especial para mí. Su primer disco me marcó mucho, y este nuevo trabajo es, probablemente, lo que más he escuchado en 2025. Un álbum que logra exactamente lo que busca: emocionarte. Comienza con “200X”, con scratches de nu-metal como referencia dosmilera, introduciendo la temática principal: nostalgia, vulnerabilidad tras las derrotas del pasado y aprendizaje a partir de los errores. Hay influencias norteamericanas y asiáticas, presentes en canciones como “Al otro lado del andén” o la maravillosa “Reactor Mako” (con numerosas referencias videojueguiles), temas más rápidos emo-punk como “Esta lluvia” o “Una astilla”, otros más pausados como “Garabato” o “La melodía de las cinco”, y momentos midwest como “Ni desde aquí se ven las estrellas”, con Comic Sans. El cierre llega con “Las piezas que faltan”, dejando todo patas arriba, tú incluido. Qué alegría que hayan vuelto.

2. [Lorena Álvarez – El poder sobre una misma](https://lorenalvarez.bandcamp.com/album/el-poder-sobre-una-misma)

Un disco precioso, que empieza cantando al amor en “Cuando el amor crece” al desamor en “Increíble” o en “Se me daba cuidao”, pasando por la depresión en “Los pensamientos”. Todas estas emociones del disco estallan en la última canción “El poder sobre una misma” donde Lorena narra todo lo que le ha pasado y se reivindica con la canción más luminosa del álbum con el mantra de “A veces hay que recuperar el poder sobre una misma, porque te lo quitan”, que te hace acabar el disco con una sonrisa.

1. [Fantasmage – No salgas más](https://fantasmage.bandcamp.com/album/no-salgas-m-s)

La noticia de que Fantasmage volvían tras una década sin publicar nada me pilló totalmente por sorpresa, pero fue una alegría enorme. El primer single, “Nada que hacer”, ya apuntaba maneras, pero es en este disco donde queda claro que Fantasmage nunca se fue. Regresan manteniendo su estilo, con mejor producción pero sin perder identidad, solo guitarra y batería. El álbum arranca con el maravilloso “Halo” (“Oh, mierda de ciudad”) y continúa con canciones increíbles como “Estatua” (“ya no es como antes, ya se te hace tarde…”), “Tan poco”, “Da igual” (“lo arreglamos consumiendo, nos da igual”) o “Baixada infernal”. Un discazo con mayúsculas que revive el garage punk y destila rabia y crítica social frente al mundo actual.",1,1765658332.0,independentspain,0,0.6,False
1plven8,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1plven8/breakston_records_the_hunted/,__BREAKSTON RECORDS__ *** THE HUNTED ***,"
I never wanted to write this down. Some truths should stay buried in the dark corners of our minds, locked away where they can't infect others. But after what I discovered about this killer that many dreamed - The Hunted, I feel obligated to warn others. 

Maybe then the families that suffered can find some closure.
What I'm about to share will haunt you as much as it haunted me.

I'm a detective in rural Montana, and for the past eight months, I've been investigating a series of disappearances along the remote stretches of Skalkaho Highway. At first, they didn't connect. just some people being stupid, forgetting to mark their way back.
But soon, I realized the patterns.

The victims always vanished near dawn or dusk. Their vehicles would be found intact, sometimes still running, as if they'd just stepped out for a moment. No signs of struggle. No blood, No bodies.
Just more dead ends and questions that kept me awake.


ENTRY 2
I can't believe we almost dismissed the case, if it wasn't for the cameras we put up. That case would have been lost.
A forest service worker found something strange while checking trail cameras last October. The images showed a blue Ford F-150 appearing in different remote locations over several months, always in the pre-dawn hours. 

The truck was distinctive – rusted hood, missing rear bumper, and a gun rack visible through the back window.
I ran the plates. The truck belonged to Daniel Hudson, no fixed address. His record was clean except for a single hunting violation from three years ago. But something about his DMV photo made my skin crawl. His eyes held no light, no warmth – just the flat, dead stare with a warm smile. It unsettled me for some reason.


ENTRY 3
Deep in the Bitterroot National Forest, miles from any marked trail, we discovered bodies, hanging from ropes. The first tree stood alone in a small clearing.
I've been a detective for fifteen years, seeing things that would break most people. What I saw, hanging from those branches.
I still can't sleep to this day without dreaming of that day. The bodies were strung up like trophies, wrapped in barbed wire that dug too deep into the rotting flesh.
They'd been gutted, drained, hung like a sick way to get others' attention.
Each victim had been ""processed"" with surgical precision… some, not so lucky.
We found more west of the first, each with its own grotesque display, and disfigurement.
The forensics confirmed what we'd all feared – all the missing people were there, transformed into a horrible warning to stay away.
The evidence we gathered painted a picture of a man who'd crossed a line most of us can't even imagine. He didn't kill for money, revenge, or any of the usual motives, but to be feared
and left alone. To just live


ENTRY 4
We found a journal in an abandoned hunting cabin, proposed to be the killer's. The entries started normally enough – observations about weather patterns, animal movements, typical hunter's notes. But they devolved into something else, more personal. 


■•■•■•■•■•■•■•■•■•■•■•■•■•■•■•■• “ I never meant to become this way!
I truly mean it. The hunger started small – just a growing sensation in my gut that normal food couldn't satisfy.
I just ignored it at first, living my ordinary life, working my job as a Doctor, across the Midwest. Sleeping in my old truck, feeding the cat I found a week before.
But the hunger grew, and with it came whispers.
On a cold night in northern Michigan. I was parked on a remote logging road, trying to save money instead of getting a motel. The moon hung full and heavy through my windshield, casting long shadows through the bare branches. That's when I first heard them – voices, telling me what I needed to do to survive.
I resisted for weeks. Living on the gas station coffee and beef jerky, and some old dinners crappie food.
Good coffee though.
But you can only fight your nature for so long. The hunger was eating me from the inside out, making me imagine things that weren't there, having nightmares none stop.

I lost thirty pounds that month. My reflection showed sunken eyes and skin stretched thin over my cheekbones. I decided to see a doctor, but it didn't help. they'd just give me some pills and threw me out.
I was checking out an abandoned barn for a place to sleep when I found the coil of rusty barbed wire. Something about the way it gleamed in my flashlight beam made my hands shake. The whispers grew louder, and the hunger twisted like a knife in my gut. 

When a hiker came by asking if I needed help, I couldn't stop myself. The wire felt right in my hands, natural, like it was always meant to be there. I think I blacked out as the next thing I saw I had hung him high in an
old oak tree. The hunger subsided for the first time in months. I felt strong but weak, sick almost.
That was three years ago. I'm twenty-three now, and I've learned a lot since then. The barbed wire was crude, amateur. I've refined my methods, learned to use tools that feel like extensions of myself – compound bows, hunting knives, and a gun. 

My truck is my home, my hunting blind, my sanctuary. I keep moving, following the backroads and forest trails across state lines, always staying ahead of the questions and missing person reports.

I'm not proud of what I do, but I've accepted it. This isn't about violence or cruelty – it's about survival. My survival from whatever is out there. The authorities don't understand, of course. They're looking for someone driven by rage or vengeance, but they're wrong. I'm driven by something I can't even comprehend, something evil.

I'm just doing it because I hope one day it will stop. I've gotten better at choosing my hunting grounds. State forests, national parks, places where people go to ""find themselves."" They never expect someone like me, someone who looks as normal as their neighbor or coworker. I keep my truck clean, my clothes neat. I pay for gas with cash and never stay in one place long enough to draw attention. The only evidence I leave behind are my tributes – my kills, strung up in the trees, a reminder that I'm not their friend.


The voices are starting to grow again. It's been almost two weeks since my last hunt, and I can feel the familiar hollowness spreading through my brain. The whispers are getting louder, more insistent. They tell me it's time to move on, to find new hunting grounds. Tomorrow I'll head west, toward the vast forests of Oregon.

Sometimes, in the quiet hours before dawn, I wonder if there is an escape from this, a way out of this torture. I'm driven by the same voices. I see signs occasionally – strange markings on trees, missing persons cases that feel familiar, stories traded in hushed voices at rural bars.

Maybe someday our paths will cross, and I'll finally understand why it's following me.
But for now, I'll try to fight it and it's power, whatever it is. The moon is waning, but I can still feel its pull. The hunger grows stronger with each passing day, and the whispers tell me I'm getting closer to catching whatever it is… something I don't want to know.
My bow rests on the passenger seat, my knives tucked safely under the driver's seat. Bloodstained.
I am not a killer… though some call me one – I was born to be a doctor… not a hunter, chosen by whatever dark force that ruled the spaces between civilization and wilderness.
But let me get this straight. I don't kill for pleasure or sport. I kill because if I don't, the hunger will consume me from the inside out, leaving nothing but an empty shell behind. A real monster.
Somewhere ahead, someone is hiking the lonely trail or possibly setting up camp in the growing darkness. The whispers came, telling me that it's just life, to kill. and the whispers were right.
This is my story, my confession, my truth. If you're reading this, pray we never meet. Pray that I won't find you. Because once I do, there's no going back to the familiar warmth of your family,
and friends. There's only death ahead“
■•■•■•■•■•■•■•■•■•■•■•■•■•■••■•■•■•■•■

We've been tracking this killer for months now. The blue F-150 has been spotted in three different states, always near where people go missing. Always near where we later find the body's, hung in trees.
– his preferred weapons are hunting knives and a compound bow. More surprising, he wrote a note left at his last scene.

“ You're wasting your time “

But there's nothing fair about what he does. He treats people like game animals, tracking them for days before making his move. The forensic evidence suggests he sometimes follows his targets for over a week, learning their patterns, waiting for the perfect moment. Like a hunter studying prey.

The most terrifying part? We're no closer to catching him than we were when we started. He moves like a ghost through the wilderness, leaving no traces except his grisly displays. The profilers say he's organized, methodical, and completely detached from human emotion. They say he is guided by something.
And somewhere out there, under a moon, he's watching. Waiting.

Now I know how that comparison sounds, but I’d expect Black Bear to be marginally better. The prices were definitely marginally higher that’s for sure…

Maybe depends what you order? Had the corn beef hash and potatoes with buttermilk biscuits I think?

The biscuits were very big but flavorless and not that soft, potatoes mid

But the big draw : the coffee

Say what you want about Dennys but at least they have cheap deals

I can get a value slam with pancakes, eggs, interchangeable with hash browns and sausage/bacon for like 10.99

Someone ordered a simple waffle and that alone was 15$ plus tax at BB

The coffee wasn’t as good as Dennys I was looking forward to having that bold light flavor

And I’m pretty sure BB was more a dark blend not nearly as much flavor.

I’d assumed all these restraints and diners would use the same great tasting coffee since apparently a certain coffee company allegedly only sells to restaurants

But yeah I got talked into going to BB

I could’ve got the same thing but cheaper at Dennys and for sure would’ve had great coffee damn lol

What are the basics of what you want in a girl friend? What are things that your besties do that make you feel really lucky to know them?

I want to be better, and I would so appreciate if I could get some of those quiet social rules written out for me to learn.

  
Edit for clarity: 

I have had a lot of guy ""friends"" in the past. I think guys tend to just chalk up differences to me being a girl so it's easier for them to look past some things, guys tend to be less inclined to be friends when you're both in your 30s and they have a significant other, so now I have no friends. 

I have been able to get some girls to go out for a coffee or a walk here and there, but after hanging out a few times they start making up excuses to not hang out. I get that not everyone is everyone's cup of tea, but I feel like having an extra friend couldn't hurt even if you're not 100% on the same level, so I don't know why things turn out like this. I have a suspicion that I accidentally insult people. I am hoping that I can find some things I can do that would make them overlook those accidents since communicating is innately difficult for me.

1plva12,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1plva12/what_do_i_do/,What do I do?,"I’ll summarize as best I can.

In 2019, I fell deeply in love with a coworker (“A”). We were close, talked daily, and she opened up to me in ways she said she hadn’t with others. I felt a strong emotional bond, but the romantic feeling wasn’t mutual. I tried to move on, but we worked together and interacted almost daily, which made it difficult.

In 2020, the pandemic shifted us to remote work. I limited interaction to work-only communication, but the intrusive thoughts continued: thinking of her upon waking, randomly during the day, and before sleep. This went on for months. I chose not to confess my feelings due to professional boundaries and potential HR consequences.

Later, I met another woman (“B”), fell in love, married her in 2021, and we had a child in 2022. During that period, thoughts of A faded significantly. However, when hybrid work resumed and I began seeing A again, the intrusive thoughts returned just as intensely. This deeply disturbed me, as I was already married with a child.

I thought unresolved emotions or resentment might be the cause, so I asked A to talk. We had coffee, discussed the past, and she shared her own mental health struggles. The conversation was cordial, but afterward I broke down emotionally, realizing I would never be with her. The thoughts did not stop.

Over time, my distress affected my behavior at work: social withdrawal, irritability, and growing resentment—toward myself most of all. Eventually, I lashed out at A via chat during a stressful moment, which upset her and caused her to leave work early. I apologized, but our relationship became distant. I transferred teams, then later left the company entirely.

For nearly two years, I had zero contact with her. I blocked her on all platforms and avoided her in public. Despite this, the intrusive thoughts continued unchanged—daily, persistent, automatic.

In 2025, while my wife was pregnant with our second child, I returned to my former company for career reasons. I inevitably saw A again. Our brief interaction felt cold and awkward, which sent me spiraling into rumination and overanalysis. The thoughts, emotions, and distress are still present.

At this point, it has been over five years. I am married, have children, have changed teams, companies, cities, and cut off contact—yet the fixation remains.

My questions are psychological, not romantic:

* What explains this kind of long-term emotional fixation?
* Is this closer to limerence, attachment issues, obsession, or something else?
* Why has avoidance, time, and life change not reduced it?
* Is confronting her again helpful or harmful, psychologically speaking?
* What evidence-based approaches actually work when “distraction” and distance clearly haven’t?

I’m not looking for moral judgment—I already judge myself enough. I’m trying to understand *what this is* and *how it’s treated*.

I am quiet at first and I need time to feel comfortable. I listen more than I speak, and I think a lot before I talk. When I like someone, I show it through consistency, remembering details, and making space for them in my routine rather than through big gestures or nonstop texting. I do not open up instantly, but when I do, I am genuine and loyal.

Dating apps have been difficult for me. Short bios and fast conversations make me feel rushed. I struggle with small talk, but I really enjoy deeper conversations about values, goals, creativity, books, games, or just how someone sees the world. I would rather talk for hours with one person than bounce between many chats that never go anywhere.

I also need alone time to recharge. That does not mean I am disinterested or emotionally unavailable. It just means I function best with balance. I enjoy calm dates like walks, coffee, bookstores, staying in to watch something together, or doing parallel activities in the same space. Loud crowded places drain me quickly.

He takes anxiety medication to control his anger. But everything is always my fault. Even things that are out of my control. The neighbors called the police because I was crying after he was yelling at me due to the drive-thru line being too long, him letting the dog get out, and him spilling coffee. I understand the culture may be different where he’s from (Brazil) but when is it okay to yell at your partner when they’re crying? He’s told me that I should control my emotions, that I’m acting like a child, that I’m an adult and need to deal with it, you name it. Whenever I get upset it’s normally because he has a snarky tone or gets a little impatient or something small. What makes me so sad is how he deals with it. “Ugh no leave me alone I can’t do this with you right now”. Like my emotions are disturbing him or something.

Hey everyone,

I've been looking to move up a (small) step from my current grinder (Breville/Sage standalone grinder), but money is not something I have massive amounts to spunk on a grinder at the moment.

I have had a Kingrinder K6 sitting in my Amazon basket for 99euro for a week as it seems to be a pretty good manual grinder for espresso and it's definitely affordable.

However, I have just come across a second-hand Eureka Mignon Instantaneo from 2019 for 195 euro, which I could bring myself to part with if it genuinely is a value proposition.

The Instantaneo doesn't seem to be manufactured anymore, but from what I can tell, it was considered a pretty good machine for an entry-level grinder.

Given the above options, what would you go for? Brand new Kingrinder K6 or second-hand (but supposedly good condition) Instantaeo?

While not having to manually grind would be nice, by all accounts, it's feasible to grind 18g of beans in the Kingrinder in sub-60 seconds, which would be fine for me as I tend to only have one espresso a day (Moka pot in the morning, espresso at lunch).

1plv0te,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1plv0te,Jura E8 vs KitchenAid KF8: A Review - Part 1,"Hello,

I couldn't decide between the Jura E8 and KitchenAid KF8 during Black Friday deals so I ended up buying both. I'm doing a comparison study between them to find which is the better one for us.

I'm new to super-automatic machines so pointers on how to and what to compare would be very helpful! Wanted to post initial impressions of having used both machines for 2 weeks now.

**Price**: +**1 KF8**  
Jura E8 - 3100.99$ USD bought from BestBuy (no black friday deals)  
KF8 - 1695.11$ USD bought from Amazon (had a black friday deal!)  
Jura is 1400$ more expensive than the KF8.

**Looks**: **+1 Jura E8**  
The Jura E8 (Chrome) has an edge over the KF8 (Cast Iron Black).  
The Jura definitely looks nicer, but the chrome casing is plastic and feels cheap for a 3000$ machine and also leaves fingerprint marks over the casing which are very visible.

The KF8 has a sand-papery texture (cast iron black) and looks like a Pentium 4 CPU met an HP Printer. It's boxy and very unimpressive.

**Touch-screen + Display: +2 KF8**  
The KF8 touch screen is seamless and very at-par with most of our other touch-screen devices we use daily. Display is large enough, clear enough. I need to award +2 because its both a touch-screen and an intuitive one at that.  
The E8, firstly, does NOT have a touch-screen. It has a color display with clunky buttons around it - it feels ancient for 2025 and a 3000$ machine. It is also not as intuitive as the KF8 and is a smaller screen with a lot of wasted space for the large buttons.

**Ease of Use: +1 KF8**  
In 2 weeks, we have found ourselves using the KF8 much more because its faster, more user-intuitive, and honestly a delight to use. If you are in a rush, the KF8 is a no-brainer. KF8 on also just has one spout for all drinks, and its a nice broad space for all kinds of mugs to sit there.  
The Jura E8 takes longer to heat up and get started. The separate spout for milk also means we have put the cup in the wrong space in morning grogginess and lost a coffee or two and created a mess.  The milk spout is on the right side and is quite narrow, meaning wide mugs will topple over so we find ourselves using lean glasses to fit that space.

**Wi-Fi: +1 Jura**  
KF8 doesn't have a smart app, for Jura you can buy the Wi-Fi Connect to access the app (though I have read reviews say you need to be close to the machine for it to connect - beating the purpose). I haven't use the Wi-Fi connect option or app.

**Pure espresso: +1 Jura**  
The Jura espresso and doppio shots tasted better. Better enough for paying 1.4k more? Definitely not.  But if the KF8 was a 8, the Jura was a 10.

**Oatmilk drinks: +1 KF8**  
The KF8 has a section for Dairy vs Non-dairy milk but the Jura E8 does not. The KF8 makes much nicer oatmilk drinks because we can configure it for the non-dairy setting. We use Barista Califia Oatmilk and prefer the KF8 drinks slightly more. 

**Milk Carafe: +1 KF8**  
The KF8 comes with a milk carafe (container?) and it has removable parts and is super easy to clean up. Can also hold 32 oz so we just empty the carton in it and put in the fridge once done.  
Jura doesn't come with anything (?????). You can buy their carafe/ container/ cool control separately. But man it is ridiculous to me that a super automatic machine doesn't come with an existing milk container of any sort. (The KF8 milk container BTW hooks perfectly fine to Jura E8 hose so we've been using the KF8 one for both.)

**Daily cleanup: +1+ Jura**  
The Jura E8 feels faster to manually cleanup. The drip tray removes effortlessly and slides back in smoothly.  
The KF feels clunkier and you have to jerk it a bit to remove the drip tray, which is annoying since you have to do it daily or frequently enough.

**Milk System Rinsing: +1 KF8**  
Easy preference for KF8 for this! It reminds you to rinse it after every drink, and sometimes forces you before proceeding to the next drink. While this sounds frustrating, it is GREAT - parts of this are also skippable, so it is a fast process.  
We forgot to rinse our Jura E8 one day and the milk solidified in parts in the thin hose. Its not possible to clean it with a straw cleaner because its far too narrow. And even after running 2 rinse cycles with their milk detergent sample thingy (comes with the machine), it still has white blotches inside it. It also takes the E8 roughly 5 minutes for the entire process, while the KF8 is done in roughly 2mins.

Overall, **we like the KF8 far more** because of the price, intuitive touch-screen, faster cleanup. But it looks terrible.  
The Jura looks nicer, makes slightly better espresso. But for a 3000$ machine - it is ridiculous that their display is so archaic,  it doesn't come with a milk carafe and needs you to buy  a Wi-Fi Connect separately. The 1400$ price difference is also a big factor. The slightly better tasting coffee in no way warrants that difference.

I also know people argue that Jura has been in the business for many years and hence is more reliable. But based on the daily ease of use for my KF8, I'm ok if my KF8 breaks down in 5yrs - I'll just replace it with a newer KF model and still be happier than using the Jura E8 for the next 15yrs.",21,1765657332.0,superautomatic,19,0.96,False

\*Iris Pallida Extrait—very dense, powdery iris. 

\*Vanille Planifolia Extrait—non-gourmand vanilla. 

\*Tonka Sarrapia Extrait—Tonka, vanilla, almonds and spices. 

\*Tobacco Honey—photorealistic honey with dry, paper tobacco. 

FRONT ROW:

\*Cuir Beluga—aldehydes, immortelle, suede and vanilla most prominent to my nose. 

\*Angelique Noire—soft, fluffy angelica with vanilla.  

\*Herbes Troublantes—fresh, clean green citrus. 

\*Bois D’Armenie—benzoin perfection.  

\*Spiritueuse Double Vanille—rounded, smooth vanilla with tiniest hint of rum. 

\*Neroli Outrenoir—black tea with neroli and crazy good vanilla + myrrh at base.

1pluzy0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nonmonogamy/comments/1pluzy0/people_keep_on_pointing_out_that_im_not_as_hot_as/,"People keep on pointing out that I'm not as hot as my partners, and I'm sort of at my limit. external validation Imbalances.","I’m 39M. I’m in a triad with my boyfriend Bob (43, long-distance) and my other boyfriend Jeff (33). Overall, we have a really loving and functional relationship.

Jeff is the newest addition to the triad and is also dating Dylan (45ish). Jeff was upfront from the start that he wanted to continue seeing Dylan, and we all agreed before I even really got to know Dylan. Bob and I are not involved with Dylan sexually or romantically. (All names are fake.)

Lately, though, I’ve been struggling hard with insecurity, and it’s coming from a few different directions. Please note that this is my first poly relationship.

1) Bob’s sudden internet fame

Bob has a huge online following now - around 35k Twitter followers, sponsors reaching out, people recognizing him in public and telling him how hot his porn is, etc. This blow ip in fame all happened after we started dating.

He’s had body-image issues in the past, so seeing him feel confident and successful is genuinely wonderful. He is hot, and he deserves to feel good about himself.

What’s been difficult is the way other people interact with me because of it.

For example: someone at a bar once asked, “Do you guys always play together or separate?” I said “both,” and they immediately replied, “Oh good, your boyfriend is so hot, I’m going to DM him.”

Or we’ll be out to dinner, and his phone lights up with Twitter notifications multiple times during the meal. He doesn’t check them and isn’t ignoring me - but just seeing them pile up hits something in my chest.

2) Dylan crossing boundaries

Dylan kept inviting Bob and me over together but was very vague about what he wanted. At one point he said it was for a birthday party, then followed it up with a picture of his sex room. That made both Bob and me uncomfortable.

I eventually told Dylan directly, “You’re making me uncomfortable and I don’t want to talk to you any more” He apologized, and later he and I got coffee to talk it through.

I asked him to be honest, and he said: “I find you attractive, but I find Bob very attractive and have been interested in him for a while. Inviting you over didn’t have to end in sex, but I didn’t want to take it off the table either. That’s why I was vague.”

I did ask for the truth, so I can’t fault him for answering honestly - but it still hurt. It also left me feeling like the ambiguity was intentional, and that feels manipulative even if it wasn’t meant to be.

3) Being treated like a conduit to my partners

When I was on Twitter, I constantly got messages like: “Hey, tell your boyfriend to answer my DM!”

On apps, people would message me saying things like: “Your boyfriend is <ScreenName>?! Lucky duck!”

I’ve also had people be friendly and flirty with me, only to follow it up with: “Want to hook up? You can invite <ScreenName> too!”

The breaking point came recently at a bar. I was chatting with someone, talking about my life, showing photos of my partners. He said, “Wow, they’re hot. Think I have a chance with those two?” I asked, “Not me?” He replied, “You said you play separate.”

I just broke down, started crying, and went home.

Where I’m stuck

I don’t know how to cope with the constant barrage of external validation my partners receive when I get so little of it. I don’t know how to emotionally process Dylan-even though I’m glad he was honest, it still feels bad.

My partners reassure me that they love me and find me attractive. I believe them. But the way other people treat me makes me wonder if anyone is actually into me at all.

I get fewer hookups and less attention than they do, and when I do get attention, it often revolves around them. It feels like I’m invisible unless I’m attached to someone hotter.

I don’t want anyone to give up relationships or hobbies they love. I’ve talked to both of them about how I’m feeling, and Bob and I have temporarily closed our side of the relationship to give me space. I didn’t want Jeff to feel pressured to end things with Dylan, since they’re close.

I guess what I’m asking is: Is it unreasonable to be this upset by all of this? And if not-how do people actually cope with this kind of imbalance in attention and validation?",5,1765657265.0,nonmonogamy,8,1.0,False

I wanted to share some thoughts on what ""vibe coding"" means to me and why I think it's such a powerful approach to building software.



\*\*What is Vibe Coding?\*\*



Vibe coding is about finding that sweet spot where productivity meets creativity. It's not just about writing code—it's about creating an environment and mindset where you're in flow, where the code feels like it's writing itself, and where you're genuinely enjoying the process.



\*\*Key Principles:\*\*



1. \*\*Flow Over Force\*\* - Don't fight against your energy levels. Code when you feel inspired, step away when you're stuck.



2. \*\*Environment Matters\*\* - Whether it's your favorite playlist, a cozy coffee shop, or a minimal setup at home, create a space that helps you vibe.



3. \*\*Small Wins Daily\*\* - Instead of massive sprints, focus on consistent progress that feels good and sustainable.



4. \*\*Tools That Spark Joy\*\* - Use the tech stack, IDE themes, and tools that make you excited to code, not what everyone says you ""should"" use.



5. \*\*Community and Sharing\*\* - Vibe coding isn't solitary—it's about sharing your journey, learning together, and celebrating the process.



\*\*Why It Works:\*\*



When you're vibing with your code, you're more creative, you solve problems more elegantly, and you actually ship. Burnout happens when we force ourselves into rigid patterns that don't align with how we naturally work best.



What does vibe coding mean to you? How do you get into your flow state?
