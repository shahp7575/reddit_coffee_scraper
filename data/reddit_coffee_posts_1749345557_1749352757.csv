1l62e5h,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaximizeMe/comments/1l62e5h/if_you_could_automate_one_daily_task_for_peak/,"üß†If You Could Automate ONE Daily Task for Peak Performance, What Would It Be?","**üß† If You Could Automate ONE Daily Task for Peak Performance, What Would It Be?**

Alright, friends, let‚Äôs dive deep into a thought-provoking question that can change the game for productivity! Imagine waking up tomorrow, and *poof*‚Äîone of your daily tasks is magically automated. What would it be? 

For real, if your morning coffee could brew itself while you keep dreaming about conquering the day, wouldn‚Äôt that be something? ‚òïüí§ 

Here‚Äôs my take‚Äîif I could automate anything, it would be the whole *‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs for dinner?‚Äù* dilemma. Seriously, how many times have you stared blankly into your fridge, contemplating life‚Äôs biggest question (and probably consuming more snacks than actual meals in the process)? üçïü•°

Let‚Äôs break it down a bit. Here‚Äôs why automating daily tasks can be monumental:

- **Time Savers**: Reducing decision fatigue is huge. Less time deciding means more time doing! For me, planning meals ahead or using a meal prep service could save hours! 
- **Reduced Stress**: Stress can be a productivity killer. Automating mundane tasks helps keep our brains focused on what truly matters. Like mastering that next work project instead of debating spaghetti vs. tacos for dinner.
- **Increased Productivity**: Think about it: what could you achieve with all that extra time? More hobbies? Chill time? Or perhaps finally diving into that side hustle? 

Now, let‚Äôs sprinkle in some humor. Ever been in a mad dash to make your bed before that one friend drops by? Or searching for your keys while doing a mini workout? ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è If only we could program our lives like a really good app! 

Those daily grind tasks can suck the life out of us pretty quickly. So, consider these options for automation (that might make you chuckle):

1. **Email Filtering** - Make your inbox work for you, not against you. Automatic sorting means no more sifting through *‚Äúimportant‚Äù* sale alerts for shoes you already own.
  
2. **Habit Tracking with Reminders** - Automatic nudges for hydration, exercise, or that 10-minute meditation you keep forgetting. It‚Äôs like having a personal cheerleader, but without the pom-poms!
  
3. **Calendar Scheduling** - Let‚Äôs spice up that calendar by automating your appointments. Going beyond the usual Zoom meeting, it could handle setting aside time for those precious moments of creativity or self-care. 

So, if you could automate just ONE task for peak performance, what would your dream task be? Would it be something fun or something essential? Who knows, maybe just getting your workout gear laid out at a specific time could make all the difference.

Chapter 1: Masks  
  


Hot summer in 1974, mid morning sun beat down on a mid-western highway, it was the kind of weather that makes people consider cracking an egg on a sidewalk to see if it fries. A man wearing a military dress uniform walked along a desolate road. He was in his mid forties, wearing tan pants and a green jacket, matching hat and dark aviator sunglasses and carrying a dark brown leather attache case. The rank insignias show he is a Lieutenant Colonel, his name tag reads ‚ÄúFlagg‚Äù. Farmers' fields of corn and wheat¬† stretching out in the distance to the left and to the right, behind him in the distance was an army jeep, hood up with a soldier standing next to it as steam billowed out of the engine and radiator fluid poured out from below.¬† The walking soldier was headed towards a sign that says ‚ÄúWelcome to Springfield‚Äù, he was whispering under his breath *must stop McCullen*.¬†

Lt. Colonel Flagg eventually found a used car dealership, Kessler Automotive, and walked into the dealership office.¬†

‚ÄúGood Afternoon‚Äù boomed the salesperson, springing forth from his desk, hand extended for a shake. He was wearing a royal blue suit jacket, matching undershirt and pants, black tie and red handkerchief in his suit pocket. His angular face wore an infectious grin, but the poor lad had a large red birthmark on his forehead, it looked slightly like a heart but not joined correctly. He had long dark brown hair in a ponytail, causing Flagg a slight sense of alarm.

‚ÄúGood Afternoon young man,‚Äù Flagg says, shaking the man's hand. ‚ÄúLieutenant Colonel Flagg‚Äù Flagg smiled before noticing an odd birthmark on the man‚Äôs forehead, one that looked kind of like a Cobra, hood flared.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm Sam, owner, operator, for Kessler Automotive, how can I help you?‚Äù the Salesperson asked

‚ÄúWell Sam, I don‚Äôt suppose you have a repair shop and a tow truck here? I have an army jeep with a blown radiator about a mile and a half back. Also, if it's possible, I need to borrow a car for a meeting across town‚Äù the Colonel replied, sitting his attache case down.¬†

‚ÄúWell, Kessler‚Äôs a family company, and we insist on treating everyone who comes though our door like family. This company was built by my wife‚Äôs grandfather, expanded by his son, my father in law, and now run by me. Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôd like to do for you and your great service to our nation.I‚Äôm guessing you‚Äôre meeting with Arbco? They‚Äôre the only business around these parts big enough for military interest. My mechanic called out sick today, and even if we have the parts it‚Äôs going to take longer than that to change out a radiator. I‚Äôll have your jeep towed in but earliest repair will be tomorrow at best, you‚Äôre gonna need to spend the night in Springfield,‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, I‚Äôm meeting with Arbco; it's an important meeting that I don‚Äôt want to be late to,‚Äù replied Flagg, glancing at his wristwatch.¬†

‚ÄúWell, I can‚Äôt just hand you the keys, but I‚Äôd be happy to drive you there and then get you to the hotel,‚Äù said Sam.¬†

‚ÄúThat would be great young man, you‚Äôd be doing your nation a favor‚Äù said Flagg, feeling the eyes of the other players of this game upon him. He had no doubt that McCullen already had feet on the ground here, probably that damned Baroness up to her spy games, but Sam here? Sam was as American as apple pie. *There‚Äôs no way they could have gotten to this bumpkin,* he thought.¬†

Sam didn‚Äôt mention to Flagg that he knew Flagg was coming, or that he knew about the meeting. He didn‚Äôt mention the mysterious woman who had paid him $1000 to make sure the mechanic couldn‚Äôt fix the car today, or that she gave him another $1000 to chauffeur Flagg, and another $1000 to attach a quarter sized circuit board that looked like a leather patch to Flagg‚Äôs attache case.¬†



Chapter 2: Five months earlier

Sam woke to the sound of a door knock, it was 2 A.M. He walked downstairs from his bedroom, pausing to pick up a baseball bat before unlocking the door and opening it. He saw a man in uniform and put down the bat. ‚ÄúSir? I‚Äôm officer Lavigne with the Highway Patrol, we need you to come with us to possibly identify a body.‚Äù

One and a half hours later Sam sat on a couch at the morgue, crying. His older brother, Dan, was dead. It was an auto accident. Accident. The fuck it was an accident. Sam knew better. His brother was a perfect driver. He didn‚Äôt care that the police claimed they found a bottle of whiskey mostly empty in the passenger side seat of the car. This was an assassination.¬†

His brother had been a very vocal critic of the Vietnam War, a war that Dan had served multiple tours in. The Government didn‚Äôt care about what the hippies said but to hear a soldier complain about the horrors that the U.S. was inflicting on a nation halfway around the world was more than they‚Äôd tolerate.¬† They admitted that there was another car involved and that the other car was the ‚Äúfamily of a Ranger‚Äù. This was code, Sam knew the only family for a Ranger was other rangers, and they had caused the accident, staging it to discredit his big brother. Sam vowed revenge that day on the U.S. military, the U.S. Government, the entire American way of life would know Sam‚Äôs wrath one day, but how? Sam was no athlete like his brother, he was just a smooth talker that won multiple local championships in chess and statewide debate championships, Sam was a nerd.

Sam could not focus on work anymore, sales were suffering, the Kessler household was in danger of losing their two story colonial along with the dealership. Two months after Dan‚Äôs death, Sam‚Äôs wife left him, taking their son with her. She left a note but Sam didn‚Äôt bother to read it, no point. ‚ÄúBetter off without her‚Äù was his only response. He began drinking almost as heavily as his brother had until the money ran low. He tried therapy but found it focused on the wrong enemy, focusing not on the Military but on his own past. He tried religion, finding nothing but platitudes and condescension in the Beatitudes and Corinthians.He started reading home printed newsletters detailing other atrocities and dark dealings of the U.S. military. Cover ups of their soldiers silencing the innocent were everywhere, Dan was intended to be just another ‚Äúlost cause‚Äù but Sam demanded justice; Sam demanded truth.

Chapter 3: Scheming Shadows

Late one night Sam was at the only bar in town that would still take his business when a beautiful dark haired woman walked in. She wore dark sunglasses at night, an all black bodysuit and high heels with red bottoms. She walked directly to his table, smiled and introduced herself as Beatrice. She had an accent, something Eastern European, maybe German. ‚ÄúSamuel, I know what happened to your brother. I‚Äôve heard about your research on the ranger and I can help you, if you can do me one small favor.‚Äù

The dark haired mysterious Beatrice explained that she was ‚Äúan agent‚Äù for a private corporation tracking the misdeeds of the current U.S. government and bringing about lawsuits where possible. She even had a business card from the company, Extensive Enterprises, proving her legitimacy.¬† She believed that Arbco would soon be involved in an attempt to sabotage an investment by a foreign industrialist that wanted to help bring manufacturing to a small rural town not too far from Springfield. Samuel‚Äôs job would be simple, be a chauffeur, slip a small electronic listening device onto the attache of the colonel, and take a tour of Arbco if offered. She would arrange a refinance of both his home mortgage and dealership‚Äôs lease on very generous terms with a personal loan for Samuel as well. She left after twenty minutes of discussion and Sam found an envelope on his doorstep with both mortgages ready for his signatures, as well as $20000 in cash for his personal expenses and another $3000 for the proposed operation, sitting on his doorstep the next day.¬†

It goes without saying that this deal seemed too good to be true, and as a wise businessman Samuel was very hesitant to sign anything without reading the fine print, so it was several weeks of heavy thought and thorough contract reading before Sam called Beatrice to agree to the deal. He faxed the paperwork back to her and waited for this Colonel to show up one day. Time went by, sales were slow but Sam was back at the dealership. Two days before the Colonel showed up at Sam‚Äôs door he received a call at 3 A.M. Sam feared that he was about to relive the nightmare of his brother's passing. He answered the phone, it was Beatrice

‚ÄúSam, it's B, the Colonel stops by tomorrow, are you ready?‚Äù she said

‚ÄúUnderstood, I‚Äôll handle this, I‚Äôll call my mechanic first thing, I assume you have everything ready with the General's car?‚Äù he asked,

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a Colonel, and yes‚Äù, she said, before disconnecting

Sam didn‚Äôt sleep for the rest of the night, he knew that after tomorrow he would be a very different man for the rest of his days. He might end up in jail for espionage if things went badly. He could get shot and killed, condemning the Kessler family name to the list of national traitors. All he wanted was revenge for what was done to his family. It was the military's fault that his brother died. Their fault that his wife and son were gone, their fault that Sam had to take this deal with a conglomerate like Extensive Enterprises, their fault he was having to betray this nation. What was this Nation anyway? Founded by religious extremists that were chased out of their home nation, driven by greed and the need for power, it was nothing that Sam wanted to be a part of, it was something that needed to be rebuilt from the ground up by someone with vision, someone who could make it a better nation where truth and justice were the entirety of the American Values.

The next morning, Sam showered and shaved, put on a clean suit, a new one he‚Äôd never worn before, called his mechanic and told him not to come into work today. The man did not believe Sam, and accused him of stealing money from his paycheck. He had to stop by the man‚Äôs home and hand over the $1000 ‚Äúbonus‚Äù before the man would accept that he wasn‚Äôt being fired. Sam headed to the dealership and opened up for business, which meant unlocking the front door, turning on the office lights and brewing coffee. While the coffee brewed Sam inspected the cars on hand for filth or overnight damage, nothing to see, all twenty-seven cars, five pickup trucks, three vans and two motorcycles accounted for. Sam waited in the office, He waited in the dealership parking lot, he waited at his desk, he waited at the coffee machine and back at his desk, no customers, and then finally the Colonel arrived. Sam smiled and eagerly greeted the man, viewing him not as a customer or a war hero, but the key to a door named Justice.¬†¬†¬†

Chapter 3: The Execution

Samuel grabbed the keys to a dodge that was fully fueled and ready to go. He held the passenger door open for Flagg, ‚ÄúLet me put your briefcase in the back sir‚Äù taking Flagg‚Äôs attache case, walking behind the car while holding the case with two hands, one on the handle and one on the bottom, before placing it in the back seat, where the Colonel could keep an eye on it. Beatrice had said he would need to hold it in place for 15 seconds to get the glue to warm from his body heat and adhere seamlessly to the attache case, Sam‚Äôs slow walk around the car provided just enough time for the patch to adhere properly. Sam drove the Colonel to the opposite end of Springfield, which, including admittance through the secured gate and park, was a 20 minute drive. Arbco‚Äôs building was designed with Brutalist architecture in mind, solid grey industrial concrete with severe angles, Springfield generally considered the office and matching factory next door to be an eyesore. Sam carried the attache in for the Colonel to the top floor before handing it over to the soldier. Flagg met a group of executives and was ushered into a conference room, the door shut. Sam was offered a behind the scenes tour of Arbco‚Äôs research and design department.¬†

Now, Arbco was primarily a logistics and transportation company, its name stood for Advanced Routing Benefit Collective Operation, and was founded by a group of professional truck drivers, railroad men, and barge owners to improve synchronized shipments of goods across the world. The R&D‚Äôs primary focus was on improving mechanical performance for the various machines that hauled commerce throughout the world, but the C.E.O had within the last five years created a skincare line, mostly at the insistence of his vain wife. On the tour one of the chemists noticed Sam‚Äôs birthmark, and decided to take a chance. They had developed an extract from a himalayan mushroom recently discovered that natives report gave the skin eternal youth. The exact translation was that it gave ‚Äúthe eternity of the serpent‚Äù but eternity was the word the translator focused on. The chemist, a Doctor Monev, had mixed the extract into a basic hand lotion and was going to start preliminary animal trials later today but he was so sure that this would give his career the boost it needed, this would definitely work, and offered a sample of the product to Sam. Sam, taunted and teased for his birthmark for his entire life, jumped at the chance and applied it immediately. This was a bad idea. Within fifteen minutes Sam‚Äôs face was covered with painful boils and he was rushed to the office infirmary.¬†¬†

Colonel Flagg sat down at a large conference table, across from Arbco‚Äôs C.E.O. Jerry Gamma, COO Richard Gershwin, and CFO James Cochran.¬†

‚ÄúGentleman, I want to keep this short and simple. The U.S. Government is in negotiations to begin purchasing weapons from our dear old friend, James McCullen. Now, I don‚Äôt need to tell you how McCullen is rumored to sell to all groups, whether friend or foe, government or terrorist, insurgent or defender. We cannot allow this transaction to occur. I need-- We, the people of America, need to not have any M.A.R.S. weapons reach out shores or to allow McCullen to Launder his blood money on the pristine beaches of Lady Liberty‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWhy are you coming to us with this Lawrence? We have nothing to do with McCullen‚Äù said Chief of Operations Richard Gershwin.¬†

‚ÄúOne of the riders for this contract, Richard, is that he had to partner with an American company to distribute his armament, and Arbco is the only logistics company he‚Äôs not been rejected by for ethical concerns. We need Arbco to say no when MARS comes calling.‚Äù

‚ÄúReject business? Especially from someone who could help us with the European Market? Are you nuts?‚Äù asked the CFO

‚ÄúColonel Flagg, please excuse James, he‚Äôs a little profit oriented‚Äù said Jerry. ‚ÄúI could theoretically pass on McCullen‚Äôs business but what‚Äôs in it for us? Last month the Navy rejected our bid for supplying Wadsworth, and now you‚Äôre asking us to say no to McCullen?‚Äù

‚ÄúJerry, I‚Äôm sorry about Wadsworth, but I can guarantee--‚Äù

Just then an office assistant burst into the office ‚ÄúColonel, your driver, he‚Äôs been injured‚Äù¬†



Chapter 4: Curses

	When Samuel woke he was in a dark room, medical machines beeped and flashed at a regular interval. He attempted to sit up but found his body restrained, he attempted to call out but there was a breathing tube down his throat. His face, hands and body seemed to be heavily bandaged. He had no idea what time, day or even where he was. The last he remembered was trying some skin cream handed to him by a doctor, and then pain, burning, searing pain, followed by darkness. After a while a doctor came in to the small room, turning on an overhead light. He looked first at the machines connected to Sam, then to Sam‚Äôs chart, before turning to leave. Sam called out to the doctor as loudly as he could but with the tube all that came out was a hissing noise. The doctor stopped, turned, and finally looked at Sam.¬†

‚ÄúMr. Kessler? Can you hear me?‚Äù asked the physician

‚ÄúSssHSSSssss‚Äù was the only response Sam could muster.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll take that as a yes‚Äù said the doctor ‚Äúyou‚Äôve been through quite an ordeal, and we currently have you on enough pain medication that you shouldn‚Äôt really be conscious‚Äù the doctor got really close to Sam‚Äôs face at this point ‚Äúthe lawyers for Arbco have to be told that you‚Äôre awake, and they are going to ask you to sign a waiver of your rights to sue the company in exchange for medical care, please do yourself a favor and refuse to sign, they will screw you over if they can,‚Äù he whispered before departing.

Shortly after there was an older gentleman in a dark suit entering the room. He had salt and pepper hair and wrinkles showing many hours of stress.¬†

‚ÄúMr. Kessler, my name is Sam Paoli, legal counsel representing ARBCO Industries. I‚Äôm here as a formality‚Äîthere‚Äôs some paperwork to finalize regarding the incident. I won‚Äôt take much of your time, I just need you to sign a form releasing Arbco of any liability from your misuse of an untested unauthorised chemical. In exchange for this waiver and your silence on this incident we are prepared to cover all medical expenses associated with your...incident‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúSSSfsuhkoou‚Äù Sam said before wiggling his arms to display the restraints.

‚ÄúAh, let me loosen those for you,‚Äù the Lawyer said, mistakenly. He undid the restraints on both arms before Sam grabbed him by the throat. It might be worth mentioning that Sam, while locally known for his dealership and the two debate championships he won at the regional level, had been taught the basics of Judo by his brother, Dan. He threw the choking lawyer to the ground before undoing the rest of his restraints. He then yanked the breathing tube out of his own throat and threw it at the lawyer ‚Äúchoke on this you creep‚Äù Sam hoarsely shouted. Sam began yanking off his bandages and found a mirror, and had his mind shattered. Replacing the pale white skin were hardened, scale shaped bumps, some were a khaki brown, some were black and formed a diamond pattern going up and over his forehead. Gone was the brown hair, gone were his ears - now just holes on the sides of his head, gone were his lips, just a line parting his skull from his jaw. Gone was his nose, two oval slits for nostrils remaining. He remembered a time years ago, back when he and his brother were just kids going to school. Sam‚Äôs birthmark had caught the attention of a local man named Joe, who taunted him, calling Sam ‚Äòsnake boy‚Äô. Joe was given a pass by most of the locals as he served as a Sunday School teacher and youth pastor.

*That mark is a sign from god, it's a sign of your evil. It shows the snake inside you that you will become*. Sam‚Äôs brother, who was still a teen at the time, wasted no time bloodying the lip of this bully, and telling Sam, *Don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôll always be here for you. I won‚Äôt let anything happen to you.*

¬†He shattered the mirror by crushing it with one hand. He then turned to the lawyer, hoarsely shrieking ‚ÄúWHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO ME!!‚Äù

‚ÄúThere wasn‚Äôt anything we could do, the reaction you had was extreme and unstoppable, your nose and ears literally fell off, they are currently being dissected for study, your skin blistered and then the blisters hardened before collapse into scales, I‚Äôm sorry, please don‚Äôt hurt me, I‚Äôll rewrite the contract, just please don‚Äôt hurt me‚Äù begged the lawyer, terror in his eyes.¬†

Sam gazed upon the lawyer, frozen in fear. He realized for the first time the power of fear, the true power of terror and the potential for terrorizing those who stood against him. He walked over to the lawyer, offering a hand to help him up before sitting on the bed. He handed the lawyer the agreement and a pen.

‚ÄúWRITE!‚Äù he screamed at the lawyer

Mr. Paoli began editing the contract, initializing his changes. The contract now granted Sam the equivalent to fifty one percent of Arbco‚Äôs outstanding stocks as well as cost free health care related to this incident. Sam signed it and was now the richest man in Springfield.¬†

The next day, in ARBCO‚Äôs boardroom there was a meeting between Mr Paoli and Jerry Gamma, COO Gershwin, and CFO Richard Cochrane¬†

‚ÄúYOU GAVE AWAY THE COMPANY!?!‚Äù shouted Cochrane.¬†

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know what else to do, he...he has people on the outside that know‚Äù said Mr. Paoli

‚ÄúBullshit! No one knows and we pay you to keep them from knowing‚Äù replied Gamma, who was rubbing his temples

‚ÄúThen explain that listening device that fell off the Colonel‚Äôs briefcase. That was too advanced to not be industrial espionage‚Äù replied Paoli

‚ÄúThat has nothing to do with--‚Äù said Gershwin

‚ÄúThe Colonel didn‚Äôt put it there!, besides, giving this guy stock puts him into the same liability as the company, he‚Äôd sue himself if he sues us, plus its...the right thing,‚Äù said Paoli

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs next, Paoli, a corner office with his own secretary? They guy is a used car salesman, he‚Äôs less than a door to door encyclopedia salesman,‚Äù said Gamma, standing up suddenly and clutching his head before falling to the ground.¬†

Chapter 5: New Leadership

Twenty minutes later Jerry Gamma was rushed to the Springfield hospital, having suffered a major stroke. Weeks went by with Jerry‚Äôs condition slowly deteriorating, followed by death. The COO and CFO both panicked in reaction to their colleagues death, each selling off the remaining balance of their ARBCO portfolios and leaving the country. They knew that without the leadership of Gamma the company would fail to maintain what it once was. Within a few days Sam was named CEO of ARBCO, although no one had seen him. Sam was too vain to appear before the board directly, instead having Mr. Paoli act on his behalf. Under Sam‚Äôs leadership a contract was quickly signed giving MARS a route for distribution to both the U.S. Military and civilian populous.¬† Sam increased the budget to R&D tenfold with a new focus on non-weapon military equipment, MRE‚Äôs, optics, protective gear, tank treads and tires for vehicles, and uniforms. He opened discussions with oil producing nations to increase distribution globally like never before. ARBCO was becoming dominant in the art of worldwide distribution. Arbco knew profit like never before and all of the employees enjoyed the life that Sam was creating for them, until they bit the hand that fed them.¬†

Samuel stayed largely in the shadows both physically and legally. Arbco‚Äôs office was renovated adding two floors to the top. The fifth floor was where the roof had been and was the last floor that the elevator would go to. It would arrive on the fifth floor but unless you had a security key, the elevator door simply would not open, and after a few moments would go down to the fourth floor. The sixth floor had its own separate elevator that only went from the fifth to the sixth floor, with a different security key, and was vacant except for one twenty foot by twenty foot room in one corner of the floor, the rest left completely vacant, bare cement with no lights. When Samuel would leave the building for the night he would dress up as a janitor, wearing a heavy rubber mask to cover his scaration.¬†

Samuel hired execs from Extensive Enterprises and Mars to run the majority of daily operations (they were located on the fifth floor), made all of the sales force salary based with additional commission based bonuses for all agents. He instituted a company minimum wage nearly twice that of the federal minimum. All employees enjoyed premium health, life, dental, and vision insurance that made long term employees of the most generous companies slightly envious. It wasn‚Äôt until after the annual christmas party that the employees started to question their boss. It had been tradition to have a catered christmas party presided over by the board, but shortly after thanksgiving it was announced that there would be no christmas dinner. Samuel could not stand the thought of celebrating the holiday without his brother and could not bear the false fraternization with the hired riff raff. Yes, he paid them well and gave the best benefits, but this was to insure the cogs would have no interest in leaving the machine, not because he liked these simpering morons. The daily operations were largely self running with some insight from his friends at Extensive Enterprises and advise from Mr. McCullen senior. Samuel began receiving memos from staff asking about him personally, all correspondence was handled through his lawyer, Mr. Paoli, but Sam still saw the memos and wanted to respond with venom and vitriol, this was tempered by his lawyer. By March several long term managers who had been with the company prior to Samuel were demanding a meeting with their mysterious boss. The first five managers to demand a meeting were fired without comment, the sixth, seventh, and eighth were mysteriously assaulted in the middle of the night by an unknown assailant.

Samuel amassed a fortune that was constantly being reinvested in the company, living mostly off of the dividends. Within two years he had also acquired all the information he needed on the ranger he blamed for the death of his brother, a vet that was simply called ‚ÄòSnake Eyes‚Äô.¬† He looked into a mirror, scaly scars covering his skin, ‚ÄúSnake Eyes? Just wait until you meet the real snake‚Äù. He then placed a call to a number given to him by Mr. McCullen, not James senior but James junior, whom he had only recently been introduced to. It seems that James Senior had recently suffered a stroke, while non-fatal it did force his son to take over the family business. The phone was ringing on the other end and then was answered by the most nondescript voice Samuel had ever heard.¬†

‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt have this number. So either you're dead already, or you‚Äôve got cash and a name I want to hear.‚Äù‚Äù

‚ÄúI was given this number by a friend from Scotland who said you could take care of an issue I have, you are Firefly?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúOk, I require all pertinent information before I‚Äôll name a price. The price is non-negotiable, non-refundable, and I offer no guarantee of success. You‚Äôre familiar with the Springfield quarry on route 231? Meet me there in one week with all the information at 2300 hours‚Äù the line then disconnected, leaving Sam to wonder how this Firefly person knew Sam was in Springfield, McCullen must have told this Firefly to expect the call, Sam thought.¬†

Chapter 6: Ashes of the Serpent

Smoke coiled like a living thing from the top floors of the ARBCO headquarters, blotting out the stars above Springfield. Sirens screamed through the streets, chasing each other in tight circles. Somewhere in the depths of the city, someone was already blaming Samuel.

Less than twenty minutes earlier, Sam had received a call from a familiar female voice with a thick eastern european accent.

""They‚Äôre moving without you. Emergency session at 0400. Level 4. Be ready.""

He didn‚Äôt trust many people, but he trusted the source enough to act. He disguised himself in the janitor uniform he‚Äôd used many times before‚Äîhooded coveralls, mask, gloves. The staff never looked twice at the overnight cleaners. He used the freight elevator up to the fifth floor, then the private lift to the sixth.

It started as a tremor. Then a thunderclap. The floor beneath him buckled. The hallway he had just stepped into exploded in a hail of fire and shattered metal. Screams. The sixth floor was gone. The fifth was already consumed in flame. He didn‚Äôt wait for the dust to settle‚Äîhe ran, coughing, stumbling, blood running from a cut above his eye.

Down below, the ARBCO tower was already being surrounded by flashing lights and emergency personnel. Cameras were turning.¬†

He didn‚Äôt see the footage yet, but it would show him‚Äîjust him‚Äîentering the building minutes before the explosion. No board members. No witnesses. Just a CEO in disguise entering a building that was no longer his.

When Sam emerged into the loading bay, coughing and limping, someone shouted, ""That‚Äôs him!""

Floodlights hit him like gunfire. Security teams in black uniforms surged forward. Sam turned, looking for any way out. Then he heard it:

*Thup-thup-thup-thup.*

A shadow cut across the smoke-choked sky. Sleek, insectile, and silent but for its blades, the black FANG helicopter descended like a ghost. The prototype he remembered authorizing only weeks earlier, never fully tested. And now it hovered just above him, cockpit door flung open.

A woman in black armor leaned out, visor glinting, voice cold and absolute.

""Come with me if you want to live, Sam.""

He blinked. ""Beatrice?""

She leapt down, boots striking the pavement.

""That name was always a lie,"" she said, her accent thicker than he remembered, her posture coiled and ready. ""Call me what I am‚ÄîThe Baroness.""

Gunfire erupted behind them. Someone shouted for a stun round. Sam didn‚Äôt hesitate. He grabbed her outstretched arm, let her haul him into the cockpit. The FANG screamed upward, wind and smoke tearing past them. Springfield shrank below as the tower burned.

He coughed, spitting blood. ""What... what the hell just happened?""

The Baroness handed him a tablet. On screen: security footage. The board meeting on the fourth floor. Gamma. Gershwin. Cochrane. Mr. Paoli, silent and seated in the corner. They were watching something. Listening. Then the footage changed‚Äîsecurity logs being altered, cameras being disabled, and finally... footage spliced of Sam entering alone.

""They framed me,"" he whispered.

""They did more than that,"" she said. ""They tried to erase you.""

He looked out the window. Below, Springfield was ablaze with flashing lights. His kingdom in ruin.

""Where are we going?""

The Baroness didn‚Äôt turn. She simply guided the FANG toward open water.

""To the Island. Where the old world ends... and your new one begins.""

As the mainland vanished behind a curtain of smoke and distance, Samuel sat back in the co-pilot‚Äôs seat, blood crusted to his temple, his skin already tightening beneath the bandages.

He looked at the Baroness‚Äîhis rescuer, his betrayer, maybe both‚Äîand whispered, ""Let‚Äôs build something better.""

Far ahead, barely visible through the dark clouds and sea spray, a jagged crescent of land loomed on the horizon. Waiting.

I 31(M) have been talking to this girl 31(F) for a few months now. It's started out with talking as most things do. After about a week we decided to meet up at her place for talking and coffee. I was really starting to like this girl. We eventually had a conversation about me helping her get her apartment in order and declutter. I spent my off days staying late at her house helping her clean and organizing. 

Things were going good. Then one night we were hanging out and decided to play cards against humanity just us to. Things turned spicy real quick and we eventually slept together that night. She had to go to church the next morning so I decided to spend the night and accompany her in the morning. I felt like things were finally going right. Then everything changed. 

She stopped texting, video messaging and calling for about a week. I thought I had done something wrong. I know I wasn't the greatest in bed but still to ghost me seemed kind of odd. A few weeks later I finally heard back and that's when I got her story. Through our that week she explained a member in her family had passed and another diagnosised with cancer. She began to spiral and drink heavy understandable. 

A few more months pass and things get worse. She loses her apartment and custody of her kid. She is a wreck at this point. I'm doing my best to help her emotionally and financially. I'm not rich by any means but I can't stand to see a girl in trouble.  Weeks go by and she is finally stable. She is in a new apartment and has a new job. Things are finally looking up. Meanwhile I'm in the background providing as much support as possible. She is calling me everyday now to vent and to keep me updated. I'm finally getting the impression that we can finally resume what was started between. 

She calls me like she does and tells me how great things have been and that she meet someone at the college where she works. They have been sleeping together for months. And that's she's never felt more alive. And my heart just sunk. Why was I putting in all this effort and money? It was a lost cause. I didn't know how to react. So I told her I needed to hang up and compose myself. I then sent her a text that said I was just surprised and a little hurt. She texted back saying that I should have known that we were just friends. I didn't know how to react so I blocked her on everything. Maybe I was pretty but my feelings should count too right?

1l61mix,https://i.redd.it/kqg2med17m5f1.jpeg,Angela stole my bike in my dream last night,"This is so weird but I thought It‚Äôd be funny to post this here. I hope that‚Äôs okay so let me know if I should post it somewhere else! I‚Äôm not exactly sure if there‚Äôs a ‚Äúsmosh dream‚Äù page or something‚Ä¶. I‚Äôd be quite concerned if there was honestly lol

I‚Äôve literally never had a dream about smosh or any of the members before, but I had the absolute STRANGEST dream of my life last night. The funniest part is parts of this could totally be a bit (maybe?) so I hope other people laugh from it a little.


I‚Äôm a college student right now and I‚Äôve been really stressing over internships and employment and I guess that ended up showing up in my dream???? Basically, I got a position as an intern for smosh, except it was barely an internship. 

One of my jobs as an intern was to help hide the fact that Anthony and Amanda had psychic powers and would often cause strange things to happen on set as a result. So anytime something flew around or magically appeared we (the interns) had to quietly and discretely get rid of the ‚Äúevidence.‚Äù

The only other job I can remember was helping set up and run errands for the crew and (very rarely) the cast. One example was running off to buy Josh some coffee from the shop that ran a floor below the office. There was a whole metal staircase outside that led down to this skater themed coffee shop- it honestly was so cool. (The shop later tried to compile evidence that there were wizards / magic people at smosh so we had to hide them in the bathroom at one point)

This last job relates to the title of this post. For some reason the cast went to this odd celebrity meet and greet in downtown LA as some of the celebrities. This ‚Äúmeet and greet‚Äù mind you was in an I-Hop. I remember seeing Tom Holland and Zendaya sitting in one booth and Tom Cruz in another, again very very weird dream. I was riding my bike around inside (in the aisles????) to check on everyone and make sure everyone had everything, when I went outside to find Chance who wasn‚Äôt in the building for some reason. I saw him standing in the parking lot of the I-hop, which wasn‚Äôt very far away so I didn‚Äôt feel the need to lock my bike when I put it on one of the bike racks. I asked him what was wrong and if he needed anything and he just asked if I could grab some food from across the highway street for him. I said yes of course (this was a dream so dream logic said it was normal) and walked across the street to grab him a sandwich from Dunkin or something. I don‚Äôt remember what the store was, but I do remember coming back across the street and not seeing Chance anywhere. I did however, see Angela get onto my bike and ride away from the I-Hop. 

When I tell you dream me was SO distraught it was the absolute funniest thing in the fucking world. I went over to the bike rack after watching her speed away and just threw my hands in the air like a disappointed dad. I am literally a broke college student so I can‚Äôt afford a new bike and most internships (in my field at least) aren‚Äôt for pay anyways, so I‚Äôm inferring that dream me wasn‚Äôt very lucky with getting a salary. Basically, Angela stole my only mode of transportation and I vividly remember walking back to my house in the middle of the road as if I was a car. 

How could you Angela I‚Äôve literally never even met you wth üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠

It was very easy to keep the ground coffee level in the trapezoid by pouring the water in slow circles and I used to do several small water top ups. 

However in the fellow the ground coffee ""rises"" along the creases on the side of the filter. Therefore the water loses contact with the coffee once the water level drops in the dripper. Doesn't that cause uneven distraction? Is that intended? The coffee doesn't taste bad but it makes me wonder.

I‚Äôm relocating to Portland soon to start my first full-time job after graduating in Austin, Texas, and could really use some help picking a good neighborhood to live in.

**A bit about me:**  
I‚Äôm in my early 20s, new to full-time work, and I don‚Äôt currently own a car ‚Äî though I‚Äôm considering getting one eventually. That said, I‚Äôve noticed parking fees at many apartments are pretty steep, so it‚Äôs not a priority unless I really need it. Ideally, I‚Äôm looking for a place that‚Äôs transit- or bike-friendly.

My workplace is near **Sumner/ NE Lombard Street** so I‚Äôd prefer to live somewhere with a reasonable commute (preferably 30 minutes or less via public transit or bike).

**What I‚Äôm looking for:**

* A safe neighborhood
* Rent that‚Äôs reasonable for a single person just starting out
* Walkable to grocery stores and maybe a few food/coffee spots
* Good public transit or bike access to my work

**Bonus questions:**

* Is owning a car in Portland really worth it for someone in my situation?
* Are there any neighborhoods where street parking is free/reliable?
* **Any specific apartment complexes or rental companies you‚Äôd recommend (or avoid)?**
* I am thinking of getting a cycle or an electric scooter for commute. Does the weather co-operate for this ?

1l615t0,https://youtu.be/5CRCEAwFvUI,3 Very Scary TRUE Failed Frozen Rescues Horror Stories,"# ""Into the Heart of K2"":

I stood on the icy slope of K2, my boots sinking into the snow, each step a fight against the mountain‚Äôs grip. My hands, raw and numb from the cold, clutched the rope that held Art‚Äôs makeshift stretcher. The canvas sagged under his weight, lashed to tent poles we‚Äôd scavenged from Camp III. Art lay there, his face pale as the ice around us, his chest rising and falling in shallow, uneven breaths. His legs were swollen, useless from blood clots‚Äîthrombophlebitis, the doctor in our team had called it. Just days ago, we‚Äôd been dreaming of the summit, the second-highest peak in the world. Now, all that mattered was getting Art down alive.‚ÄúPete, he‚Äôs fading,‚Äù Charlie said, his voice low, almost lost in the wind. He knelt beside Art, his gloved fingers fumbling to check the pulse at Art‚Äôs neck. His beard was crusted with ice, and his eyes were red from exhaustion. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt stay here much longer.‚ÄùI nodded, my throat tight. My mind flashed back to a week earlier, when a storm had hit us higher up the mountain. Five of the team had slipped, their ropes tangling as they fell toward a crevasse. I‚Äôd jammed my ice axe into the snow, held the rope with everything I had, and stopped them from plunging to their deaths. They called it ‚ÄúThe Belay,‚Äù like I was some kind of hero. But now, looking at Art, his lips cracked and blue, I felt anything but heroic. I felt like the mountain was winning.‚ÄúWe move now,‚Äù I said, my voice steady despite the knot in my chest. The slope ahead was a nightmare‚Äîsteep, slick with ice, and littered with jagged rocks that could tear through our gear. ‚ÄúTony, you‚Äôre with me at the front. George, Dee, you steady the sides. Bob, Charlie, you anchor the back.‚ÄùTony adjusted his hood, his face grim. ‚ÄúThis path‚Äôs gonna be hell,‚Äù he muttered, flexing his frostbitten fingers. His gloves were worn thin, and I could see the pain in his wince.‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just do it,‚Äù Bob said, his voice flat. He was the quiet one, but I saw the way his hands shook as he checked the knots on the stretcher. We were all scared, though nobody said it out loud.We started down, the stretcher creaking as we moved. Each step was a gamble. The snow was uneven, hiding crevices that could swallow a man whole. My boots slipped on a patch of ice, and I caught myself, heart pounding. The rope burned in my hands, even through my gloves. Behind me, Art groaned, a weak sound that cut through me like a knife.‚ÄúTalk to him,‚Äù I said, glancing at Dee. ‚ÄúKeep him with us.‚ÄùDee leaned close, her voice soft but firm. ‚ÄúArt, you hear me? We‚Äôre getting you down. You‚Äôre tough as nails, you know that. Just hang on.‚ÄùArt‚Äôs eyes fluttered open, glassy and unfocused. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm‚Ä¶ slowing you down,‚Äù he whispered, his voice barely audible. ‚ÄúLeave me.‚Äù‚ÄúNo chance,‚Äù I snapped, louder than I meant to. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre all getting off this mountain. Together.‚ÄùHe didn‚Äôt answer, just closed his eyes again. I turned back to the slope, my jaw tight. The path narrowed, forcing us to inch along single file, the stretcher scraping against the rock wall on one side. The drop on the other side was dizzying‚Äîhundreds of feet to a jagged basin below. My stomach churned every time I looked down.‚ÄúWatch your footing,‚Äù George called, his hands steadying the stretcher‚Äôs side. ‚ÄúThis ledge is crumbling.‚Äù‚ÄúSlow and steady,‚Äù I said, my eyes locked on the rope. It was fraying slightly where it rubbed against a sharp rock. I made a mental note to check it at the next stop. If that rope snapped, we‚Äôd lose Art in an instant.We‚Äôd been moving for hours, maybe four or five, though it felt like days. My legs ached, my thighs burning from the effort of keeping the stretcher level. My lungs screamed with every breath, the thin air stealing my strength. The others looked just as bad‚ÄîCharlie‚Äôs face was drawn, Tony‚Äôs shoulders hunched, Dee‚Äôs hands trembling as she gripped the canvas. Bob kept his head down, like he was afraid to look at Art.‚ÄúWe need to rest,‚Äù Tony said finally, his voice rough. ‚ÄúJust for a minute.‚ÄùI hesitated. Every second we stopped, Art got weaker. But Tony was right‚Äîwe were spent. ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúFive minutes. Check the gear.‚ÄùWe eased the stretcher onto a wider ledge, barely big enough for us to stand shoulder to shoulder. Bob knelt, inspecting the ropes, while Charlie pulled a thermos from his pack, passing it around. The water was lukewarm, metallic-tasting, but it was something. I crouched beside Art, brushing snow from his face.‚ÄúYou still with us?‚Äù I asked, trying to sound calm.He nodded weakly. ‚ÄúSorry‚Ä¶ for this,‚Äù he said, his voice a rasp.‚ÄúDon‚Äôt,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd do the same for any of us.‚ÄùCharlie joined me, his eyes dark. ‚ÄúPete, his pulse is thready. We‚Äôve got to move faster.‚Äù‚ÄúI know,‚Äù I said, my gut twisting. ‚ÄúBut this slope‚Ä¶ one mistake, and we‚Äôre all gone.‚Äù‚ÄúWe‚Äôre doing our best,‚Äù Dee said, her voice shaking. ‚ÄúBut this mountain‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs like it wants him.‚Äù‚ÄúDon‚Äôt talk like that,‚Äù George snapped, his hands balling into fists. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre getting him down.‚ÄùI wanted to believe him, but doubt gnawed at me. The mountain didn‚Äôt care about our plans, our promises. It was just rock and ice, endless and cruel. I stood, checking the rope again. The frayed spot looked worse. ‚ÄúWe need to reinforce this,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúAnyone got spare cord?‚ÄùBob dug into his pack, pulling out a thin coil. ‚ÄúThis‚Äôll have to do,‚Äù he said, handing it to me.I tied it around the main rope, my fingers clumsy from the cold. Every second felt like it was slipping away, like Art‚Äôs life was leaking out with every shallow breath. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go,‚Äù I said, standing. ‚ÄúNo more stops until we hit the next camp.‚ÄùWe lifted the stretcher, moving slower now, the weight heavier in our hands. The path twisted, forcing us to angle the stretcher awkwardly. My arms burned, my back screaming from the strain. I kept my eyes on the ground, watching for cracks, for loose snow, for anything that could trip us up.Then I felt it‚Äîa low rumble, deep in the mountain‚Äôs core. The ground trembled under my boots. My heart stopped. I looked up, scanning the slope above. Snow was moving, a white wave gathering speed.‚ÄúAvalanche!‚Äù I shouted, my voice raw. ‚ÄúBrace yourselves!‚Äù‚ÄúHold the rope!‚Äù Tony yelled, planting his axe into the ice. I did the same, my hands locking around the rope as the snow roared toward us. It hit like a train, a wall of cold and force that knocked the air from my lungs. I heard screams‚ÄîDee‚Äôs, Charlie‚Äôs, maybe my own. The stretcher jerked violently, the rope burning through my gloves.‚ÄúArt!‚Äù Dee cried, lunging to grab the canvas.But the snow was too strong. It tore the stretcher from our hands, snapping the ropes like they were nothing. I watched, frozen, as Art vanished into the white, the stretcher tumbling down the slope, swallowed by the avalanche. The roar faded, leaving a terrible silence.‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I whispered, my knees buckling. I stumbled to the edge, staring into the snow-choked void below. Nothing. Just an endless sea of white.‚ÄúPete, we can‚Äôt stay here!‚Äù Charlie grabbed my arm, pulling me back. ‚ÄúThe slope‚Äôs not stable!‚Äù‚ÄúWe have to find him!‚Äù I shouted, my voice breaking. I scrambled along the ledge, searching for any sign‚Äîa scrap of canvas, a glint of metal. But there was nothing.‚ÄúHe‚Äôs gone,‚Äù George said, his voice hollow. He stood there, staring at the drop, his hands still clutching a piece of broken rope.‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt just leave him!‚Äù I said, but even as the words left my mouth, I knew they were empty. The avalanche had buried him, or worse, carried him to the rocks below. We had no way to reach him.Tony put a hand on my shoulder. ‚ÄúPete, we did everything we could.‚Äù‚ÄúDid we?‚Äù I asked, my voice shaking. ‚ÄúDid we do enough?‚ÄùNobody answered. We stood there, the wind cutting through us, our breath clouding in the air. My hands were raw, blood seeping through my gloves where the rope had torn my skin. I looked at the others‚ÄîCharlie‚Äôs face was gray, Dee‚Äôs eyes red with tears she wouldn‚Äôt let fall, Bob staring at the ground like he could unsee it all.‚ÄúWe need to move,‚Äù I said finally, my voice barely audible. ‚ÄúBefore we lose anyone else.‚ÄùThe descent was a blur. We moved like ghosts, silent, each step heavier than the last. The guilt was worse than the cold, worse than the exhaustion. It clung to me, a weight I couldn‚Äôt shake. I kept seeing Art‚Äôs face, his weak smile when we‚Äôd promised to get him home. I‚Äôd promised. And I‚Äôd failed.We reached base camp days later, battered and broken. We organized a search, combed the slopes where the avalanche had hit, but found nothing‚Äîno stretcher, no gear, no Art. It was like the mountain had erased him. We sat in the mess tent, the silence between us louder than any storm.‚ÄúCould we have tied the ropes tighter?‚Äù Dee asked, her voice small. ‚ÄúMaybe if we‚Äôd moved faster‚Ä¶‚Äù‚ÄúDon‚Äôt,‚Äù Charlie said, his eyes on the floor. ‚ÄúIt won‚Äôt change anything.‚Äù‚ÄúI keep thinking,‚Äù Tony said, ‚Äúif I‚Äôd held on harder, maybe‚Ä¶‚Äù‚ÄúStop,‚Äù I said, my voice sharper than I meant. ‚ÄúWe all held on. We all tried.‚ÄùBut the words felt hollow. I lay awake that night, staring at the tent ceiling, replaying every moment. The frayed rope. The rumble of the avalanche. The snap as Art was torn away. I wondered if he‚Äôd known, in those last seconds, that we‚Äôd tried. That we‚Äôd fought for him.Years later, in 1993, climbers found Art‚Äôs remains, tangled in old ropes at the base of K2. They buried him there, under a pile of stones they called the Gilkey Memorial. It‚Äôs still there, a quiet marker for the ones the mountain claimed. I never went back to K2. I couldn‚Äôt. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw that avalanche, heard the ropes break, felt the weight of that failure. I‚Äôd saved the team once, but not Art. And that loss‚Äîit‚Äôs heavier than any mountain I‚Äôll ever climb.

  


# ""Frozen on the North Face"":

I was in the lodge at Kleine Scheidegg, the wooden walls creaking around me, a half-empty cup of coffee cooling in my hands. The air smelled of damp wool and woodsmoke. A man burst through the door, his face pale, his coat dusted with snow. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a climber stuck on the north face,‚Äù he said, breathless. ‚ÄúToni Kurz. His team‚Äôs gone. Avalanche.‚ÄùMy stomach dropped. The Eiger‚Äôs north face was a killer. I‚Äôd guided climbers up safer routes, but the north face was different‚Äîsteep, icy, unforgiving. I‚Äôd heard stories of men lost to its cliffs, their bodies left dangling for days. Now Toni was up there, alone. I set my cup down, the clink loud in the quiet room, and grabbed my pack. Three other guides‚ÄîHans, Peter, and Karl‚Äîwere already gearing up. No one spoke much. We all knew what we were facing.We took the train to the Eigerwand Station, a stop carved deep inside the mountain. The tunnel was dark, the air heavy with the smell of wet stone. My boots echoed on the floor as we reached the Stollenloch, a small window opening onto the face. I leaned out, and the wind hit me hard, tugging at my scarf. Far above, maybe 200 feet, I saw him‚ÄîToni Kurz, a tiny figure hanging from a rope, his body swaying like a broken toy. My chest tightened. He was alive, but for how long?‚ÄúKurz! Can you hear me?‚Äù I shouted, my voice bouncing off the rock.A faint sound came back, weak and ragged. ‚ÄúHelp‚Ä¶ please‚Ä¶‚ÄùI gripped the edge of the window, my knuckles white. He was still fighting, but he wouldn‚Äôt last long. Not up there. Not alone.Hans tied a rope around his waist, his hands steady despite the tension in his face. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll lead,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou follow. We move fast.‚ÄùI nodded, pulling my gloves tighter. My fingers were already stiff from the cold. We climbed out onto the face, one by one, the rock biting into my palms through the leather. The surface was slick, coated with ice that cracked under my boots. Every move felt like a test, the drop below us endless. I kept my eyes on Toni, his silhouette stark against the pale rock. He wasn‚Äôt moving much now, just swaying, his head slumped.‚ÄúBe careful, Hans!‚Äù I called as he reached a narrow ledge about 50 feet up.‚ÄúI‚Äôm good,‚Äù he yelled back, his voice sharp. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs rough. There‚Äôs an overhang ahead.‚ÄùThe overhang. I‚Äôd heard about it‚Äîa massive shelf of rock jutting out, blocking the way like a giant‚Äôs hand. My heart sank. If we couldn‚Äôt get past it, Toni was done for. I pushed the thought away and kept climbing, my arms burning, my breath coming in short, painful gasps. The wind stung my face, and the rope rubbed my shoulders raw.We reached the ledge, all four of us crowded together, panting. Toni was closer now, maybe 50 feet above. I could see his face clearly‚Äîpale, almost gray, his eyes half-open, his lips cracked. His hands were frozen to the rope, his fingers curled like claws. He looked more dead than alive, and the sight made my throat tight.‚ÄúToni, hang on!‚Äù I shouted. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre coming for you!‚ÄùHe didn‚Äôt answer. I wasn‚Äôt sure he could hear me anymore.Peter wiped sweat from his brow, his breath clouding in the air. ‚ÄúWe could try throwing a rope,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf he grabs it, we can pull him down.‚Äù‚ÄúIt‚Äôs worth a shot,‚Äù Karl agreed, already uncoiling a rope from his pack.We tied a small weight‚Äîa metal carabiner‚Äîto the end and took turns swinging it toward Toni. The first throw went wide, the rope slapping the rock and falling back. My stomach twisted. We tried again, Hans leaning out, his face red with effort. This time, the rope landed across Toni‚Äôs shoulder, dangling just within his reach.‚ÄúGrab it, Toni!‚Äù I yelled, my voice hoarse. ‚ÄúYou can do it!‚ÄùHis head twitched, and for a moment, I thought he‚Äôd move. His fingers twitched, but they didn‚Äôt let go of the rope he was hanging from. He was too weak, too frozen. My hope crumbled.‚ÄúWe have to climb to him,‚Äù I said, my voice shaking. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the only way.‚ÄùHans looked at the overhang, his jaw tight. ‚ÄúThat thing‚Äôs impossible. We‚Äôll never get over it.‚Äù‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have a choice,‚Äù I snapped, frustration boiling over. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs dying.‚ÄùPeter put a hand on my shoulder. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll try. But we need a plan.‚ÄùWe studied the overhang, its shadow looming over us. It was a smooth, curved slab, like the underside of a wave frozen in stone. There was no way to climb straight up. My mind raced, searching for options.‚ÄúWhat if we swing across?‚Äù Peter said. ‚ÄúUse the rope to pendulum to the other side.‚ÄùIt was dangerous, but it was all we had. Hans hammered a piton into the rock and tied the rope to it. He went first, swinging out over the void, his boots scraping the wall. My heart stopped as he dangled, but he made it, landing on a small outcrop just below Toni. I went next, the rope creaking under my weight. The drop below was dizzying, a gray abyss that seemed to pull at me. I landed beside Hans, my legs shaking.Toni was right there, maybe 10 feet above. I could see the frost on his jacket, the way his chest barely moved. ‚ÄúToni, we‚Äôre here!‚Äù I called. ‚ÄúJust hold on!‚ÄùHis eyes opened, just a sliver, and he whispered something‚Äîmaybe ‚Äúhelp‚Äù‚Äîbut it was too faint to be sure. I reached up, stretching until my shoulder screamed. My fingers brushed the tip of his boot, but I couldn‚Äôt grab it. Hans steadied me, and I tried again, standing on his shoulders, my ice axe in hand. The tip grazed Toni‚Äôs rope, but it wasn‚Äôt enough.Then I saw it‚Äîthe knot. The rope holding Toni was tangled, a thick, frozen mess jamming it tight. He couldn‚Äôt move, couldn‚Äôt slide down to us. My blood ran cold.‚ÄúWe need to free that knot,‚Äù I said, my voice barely steady.Hans climbed closer, tugging at the rope. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs stuck,‚Äù he grunted. ‚ÄúFrozen solid.‚ÄùWe tried everything. Karl used his knife, sawing at the ice until his blade dulled. Peter lit a match, holding it to the knot, hoping to melt it. The flame flickered and died, useless. I pulled at the rope with my hands, my gloves tearing, my fingers burning from the cold. Hours passed, the light fading. Toni‚Äôs breathing grew slower, shallower. I kept talking to him, my voice cracking.‚ÄúStay with us, Toni,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre almost there. Just hold on.‚ÄùBut he wasn‚Äôt there. His eyes closed, his head slumped forward, and his chest stopped moving. I stared, my breath caught in my throat. He was gone, right in front of us. We‚Äôd been so close, inches away, but the Eiger didn‚Äôt care.‚ÄúWe have to go back,‚Äù Peter said, his voice quiet. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing more we can do.‚ÄùI shook my head, not wanting to believe it. ‚ÄúWe were right there,‚Äù I whispered. ‚ÄúRight there.‚ÄùHans put a hand on my arm. ‚ÄúCome on. We can‚Äôt stay.‚ÄùThe climb down was torture. My body ached, my hands bled through my gloves, but the real pain was in my chest. I kept seeing Toni‚Äôs face, his frozen hands, his lifeless eyes. Back at the station, I collapsed onto the floor, the cold stone seeping into my bones. The other guides were silent, their faces drawn. No one wanted to say it, but we all felt it‚Äîthe Eiger had won.‚ÄúDid we do enough?‚Äù I asked Hans later, sitting by the stove in the lodge.He stared at the floor, his hands clasped tight. ‚ÄúWe tried,‚Äù he said after a long pause. ‚ÄúWe climbed as far as we could. That‚Äôs all anyone could‚Äôve done.‚ÄùBut it didn‚Äôt feel like enough. That night, I lay on my cot, staring at the ceiling. I saw Toni‚Äôs face every time I closed my eyes, heard his faint voice begging for help. I wondered if I‚Äôd missed something, some trick or tool that could‚Äôve saved him. The Eiger loomed outside, its shadow filling my dreams. I wasn‚Äôt sure I‚Äôd ever climb again, not after that. The mountain didn‚Äôt just take Toni‚Äîit took a piece of me too.

  


# ""Buried in White: The Day Mount Hood Took Nine"":

I stood at the base of Mount Hood, staring up at its jagged, snow-covered slopes, my breath visible in the crisp air. It was May 12, 1986, and I was part of a rescue team scrambled to find nine climbers from Oregon Episcopal School‚Äîseven students, one teacher, and one parent volunteer‚Äîwho‚Äôd vanished on their way to the summit. Mount Hood was a beast, a 11,249-foot peak that had claimed lives before, its icy ridges and sudden storms unforgiving. My stomach twisted as we got the call. These were kids, some as young as fifteen, caught somewhere up there, and time was slipping away.We‚Äôd heard they‚Äôd set out two days ago, a school tradition, led by experienced guides who knew the mountain‚Äôs dangers. They‚Äôd planned to summit and return in a day, but something went wrong. Maybe they got lost, maybe they underestimated the mountain. All we knew was they hadn‚Äôt come back. My team‚Äîfour of us, all seasoned rescuers with years on these slopes‚Äîloaded our gear: ropes, ice axes, crampons, medical kits, and thermal blankets. My hands shook as I checked my pack, not from cold but from the weight of what we were heading into. Kids were involved, and that made every second feel heavier.We started the climb, boots sinking into the snow, the crunch echoing in the quiet. The trail was steep, winding through pine trees before opening to a stark, white expanse. My legs burned, and my chest heaved with each step, the altitude thinning the air. My teammate, John, adjusted his harness beside me, his face grim. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre probably in a snow cave, waiting it out,‚Äù he said, his voice trying to hold hope.‚ÄúMaybe,‚Äù I said, but my gut told me different. ‚ÄúKids don‚Äôt last long up here if they‚Äôre not prepared.‚Äù I kept my eyes on the slope, scanning for any sign‚Äîa footprint, a piece of gear, anything. The higher we climbed, the more the silence pressed in, broken only by the clink of our carabiners and the occasional thud of snow sliding off a rock.We reached the upper slopes, near the summit triangle, where the group was last reported. The terrain was brutal‚Äîsteep pitches of ice and loose rock, ready to give way. My heart pounded, not just from the climb but from the fear of what we‚Äôd find. ‚ÄúLook!‚Äù my teammate, Lisa, called, pointing to a splash of red against the snow. We rushed over, hope flaring, but it was just a torn jacket, its fabric shredded, flapping like a warning. ‚ÄúThey were here,‚Äù I said, picking it up. It was small, a kid‚Äôs size, and my throat tightened.‚ÄúKeep moving,‚Äù our lead, Tom, said, his voice steady but eyes tense. We spread out, shouting, ‚ÄúHello! Can you hear us? Oregon group, call out!‚Äù Our voices bounced off the ice, swallowed by the mountain. No answer. Then I spotted tracks‚Äîfaint, uneven, but definitely human‚Äîleading toward a narrow gully flanked by towering ice walls. My pulse spiked. ‚ÄúThey went this way,‚Äù I said, pointing. The gully was a death trap, prone to avalanches and rockfall, but it was our only lead.We roped up, moving single file, testing each step. The walls loomed over us, their shadows cold and heavy. My ice axe bit into the snow, anchoring me as I glanced down‚Äîhundreds of feet of sheer drop. ‚ÄúCareful,‚Äù I muttered to John behind me. ‚ÄúThis place could collapse.‚Äù He nodded, his face pale, gripping his rope tight.At the gully‚Äôs base, we found it‚Äîa snow cave, its entrance half-buried, barely visible. My heart leapt. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre here!‚Äù I shouted, dropping to my knees and digging with my hands. The snow was hard, packed tight, but we clawed through, Lisa and Tom beside me. ‚ÄúCome on, come on,‚Äù I whispered, my fingers numb. The entrance widened, and I crawled in, flashlight shaking in my hand.Inside, it was a tomb. Nine figures huddled together, their bodies curled against the cold. Faces pale, lips blue, eyes closed. My breath caught. ‚ÄúHey, can you hear me?‚Äù I said, shaking the nearest, a girl with a braid, maybe sixteen. Her skin was like ice, no pulse. I moved to the next, a boy with frostbite-blackened fingers, his jacket crusted with snow. ‚ÄúCome on, kid, wake up,‚Äù I begged, pressing for a pulse. Nothing. My chest ached as I checked one after another‚Äîseven were gone, their bodies stiff, frozen in their last moments of trying to stay warm.But then, a faint groan. ‚ÄúHere!‚Äù I shouted. It was a teacher, a woman with ice in her hair, her breath shallow but there. Next to her, a boy, maybe seventeen, his chest barely moving. ‚ÄúTwo alive!‚Äù I called to the team. Lisa rushed in, her medical kit open. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre hypothermic, bad,‚Äù she said, wrapping them in thermal blankets. ‚ÄúWe need to get them out now.‚Äù‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not gonna make it if we don‚Äôt move fast,‚Äù Tom said, his voice tight. We secured them to stretchers, the teacher‚Äôs hand limp in mine. ‚ÄúStay with me,‚Äù I whispered, tucking the blanket tighter. Her lips moved, a faint mumble, but no words came. The boy‚Äôs eyes fluttered, and I leaned close. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre gonna be okay, kid. We‚Äôve got you.‚Äù He didn‚Äôt respond, but his chest still moved, and that was enough to keep me going.The gully was too steep to climb back up with stretchers, so we decided to signal for a helicopter. John radioed base camp, his voice urgent. ‚ÄúTwo survivors, critical. Need immediate evac at the lower ledge!‚Äù The reply crackled through. ‚ÄúChopper‚Äôs on standby, but it‚Äôs dicey up there. Can you reach a clearing?‚Äù‚ÄúWe‚Äôll make it,‚Äù I said, but doubt gnawed at me. We started down, dragging the stretchers, the snow slippery underfoot. Every step was a fight‚Äîmy arms burned, my legs shook, and the stretchers caught on rocks, jarring the survivors. The boy groaned again, weaker now. ‚ÄúHang on,‚Äù I said, gripping his hand, his fingers cold as stone. The teacher‚Äôs breathing was so faint I kept checking to make sure she was still with us.We reached a wide ledge, a spot where a chopper might land. My heart lifted as we set up flares, their red glow cutting through the gloom. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre coming,‚Äù Lisa said, her voice hopeful. Soon, we heard it‚Äîthe thump-thump of blades echoing off the peaks. The helicopter appeared, a black speck growing larger, but it wobbled, caught in turbulent air. ‚ÄúToo unstable!‚Äù the pilot‚Äôs voice crackled over the radio. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt get close!‚Äù‚ÄúTry again!‚Äù I shouted, desperation rising. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre dying!‚Äù The chopper circled, dipping lower, the roar deafening. We secured the stretchers, ready to hook them to the winch, but the wind slammed the helicopter sideways, and the ropes tangled. ‚ÄúNo, no, come back!‚Äù I yelled, but the pilot pulled up, the chopper retreating. My stomach dropped. We were on our own.‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt wait,‚Äù Tom said, his face grim. ‚ÄúWe keep going.‚Äù We lifted the stretchers, moving faster now, slipping on ice, rocks skittering down the slope. The boy‚Äôs breathing grew fainter, his chest barely rising. ‚ÄúStay with us, kid,‚Äù I said, my voice breaking. I checked his pulse‚Äîweak, then nothing. I pressed harder, willing his heart to beat, but he was gone. ‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶‚Äù I whispered, tears burning my eyes. Lisa looked over, her face crumpling, but we couldn‚Äôt stop.The teacher was still alive, her pulse a faint flutter. We pushed on, muscles screaming, the stretcher‚Äôs weight pulling at my shoulders. My mind raced‚Äîimages of the kids in the cave, their frozen faces, the boy‚Äôs last groan. Every step felt like a betrayal, like we were failing them all over again. The slope steepened, and I nearly lost my footing, the stretcher jerking in my hands. ‚ÄúCareful!‚Äù John shouted, steadying me.When we finally reached base camp, medics swarmed us, their faces hopeful until they saw the boy. They turned to the teacher, checking her vitals, but her chest stilled before they could start treatment. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs gone,‚Äù a medic said, voice flat. I stood there, numb, staring at the stretchers, the blankets covering their faces. Nine people‚Äîseven kids, two adults‚Äîgone. We‚Äôd found two alive, carried them miles, fought for every inch, but the mountain took them anyway.We sat in silence, the team around me, our gear scattered like broken promises. The medics packed up, their movements slow, defeated. I kept seeing the girl with the braid, the boy‚Äôs blackened fingers, the teacher‚Äôs faint breath. We‚Äôd been so close, inches from saving them, but Mount Hood didn‚Äôt care. It was a graveyard, and that day, it claimed nine more. The weight of that failure settled into my bones, a cold that no fire could warm, a horror that would follow me forever.",1,1749348237.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False
1l615mp,https://www.reddit.com/r/LAMetro/comments/1l615mp/for_operators_whats_your_wildest_story_youve_seen/,For operators: what‚Äôs your wildest story you‚Äôve seen on duty?,"Hi there! I'm a recent USC Journalism grad and daily LA Metro rider for 2 years. I‚Äôm starting early research on a possible project about the experience of Los Angeles public transit operator. This post is not a promotion or media request.

I have a few open questions for Metro / DASH / Big Blue Bus operators or anyone close to the work:

1. Do you think Metro tends to hire people with a ‚Äútough‚Äù or ‚Äúhard to mess with‚Äù vibe? Are most operators naturally that cool under pressure, or does that come with the job?

2. How did you get used to the smells on the job (especially on the buses/railway)? I feel like it‚Äôs gotten better, but I‚Äôve always wondered.

3. What are your top sources of work stress these days ‚Äî traffic, accidents, night shift, or wage...?

And lastly: what‚Äôs the craziest or most unforgettable moment you've had while driving for Metro?

In addition, if anyone is open to sharing more in a casual coffee chat or Zoom, I‚Äôd love to hear your perspective. No recordings, no pressure.

Thanks for keeping LA moving every day. Everybody stay safe!",6,1749348220.0,LAMetro,0,1.0,False

I'm a private introverted person who enjoys quiet alone time. I definitely need time to 'recharge' after being social. Anyways, this chic (Brittany) and I became friends from work and it was fine for a few months. Past couple of months, I've noticed Brittany becoming clingy and a bit obsessive. 

Communication: She would text me constantly (im not huge into texting back and forth all day and she knows that. I enjoy deep talks -face to face) telling me every single thing she did that day with pictures of her family all the time. I would become overwhelmed and not respond as much. When we would hangout I'd let her know that her constant messages were overwhelming me and she would acknowledge. *sigh* constant messages continue to where I just stopped responding and turned off the notifications. She's still going having full on conversations to herself ....

Hanging out: Brittany wants to hangout all the time for extended hours. If I tell her im busy she would deny it. She always wants to pick me up and when I tell her ill meet her there instead, she would get annoyed and make me feel bad about not trusting her. At first she would always pay for my meals and coffee calling it dates and we would joke how she's my sugar mommy since she's much older. She then would continue to shower me with gifts and compliments. It was fun for a couple of months until she started amping it up with ""you're my favorite person"" calling me babe or hot. I became very uncomfortable so i brought this up to her. She dismissed it saying that we are ""meant to be"" mind you she is married with children. I have pulled back a little bit.  When she asks to hangout, ill tell her I want to stay home and finish reading or game. I know shes trying to lure me out with key words ""coffee"" ""books"" ""pancakes"" ""walking"" she knows i love all those things and I would say okay. She'd come pick me up, pay for everything, and make me feel uncomfortable all over again. So i back off again saying im busy. She would ask if she can stop by and leave a gift. I would tell her no thanks, I'm busy. There are gifts outside my door all the time. Knowing she came to my place without my knowledge creeps me out. 

I've told her several times how I feel and my icks and she can't take a hint. I'm starting to get irritated  and I hate it. I...*sigh* I just don't know.

1l61415,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1l61415/aitah_for_asking_my_best_friend_why_she_didnt/,AITAH for asking my best friend why she didn't just eat chicken and rice instead of pizza? (absurd story but true),"For context, I'm a 20-year-old female, and so is my best friend, who will be 21 next month. We've known each other since preschool, and so I consider her a sister, which means I'll ask questions if her choices are questionable or give her advice where it's needed. I've never been a yes man to any of my friends, it's not who I am- I like being invested and want them to all do great for themselves, which means sometimes shooting down unflushed out plans, which could hurt them in the long run. My best friend tends not to see the bigger picture of things, and I don't mind telling her straight, especially when all of our other friends haven't known her as long and don't feel as comfortable.

Okay, that aside, let's get into why I'm here. My best friend has been on the path to losing weight, I'm not sure if it's for herself or because of the boyfriend she just got (he works out a lot)-- but she limits herself to eating twice a day and not even full protein-heavy meals that will keep her full. I'm not sure if her working out is consistent, and she doesn't get the required amount of sleep because she stays up waiting for her boyfriend to be done with college. (They have different time zones.)

So while I was eating, I updated the group chat about my dinner- just macaroni and some chicken breast. There are only three of us in there, including me and my best friend (whom I'm typing about), and another friend that I've known for like six years. My best friend says she ate a slice of pizza for dinner, saying that it was unfortunate and she didn't want to eat it since she was going to make chicken and rice, however, her aunt brought it, so she ate it. I asked a simple question, ""Wait. Why didn't you just eat the chicken and rice then if you didn't want the pizza?"" It makes sense, and it's a genuine question; it would hold her over longer than a slice of pizza would, and it's surely fewer calories. She and I quote said, ""Why yo ass always in my fuck ass business girl""

I was shocked because, hello? I was genuinely asking and not trying to be funny or shady- it just made sense.  But remember, earlier I said I'm not a yes man- and I always speak my mind- especially if we've been friends for a long time. So I said, ""You said eating pizza was unfortunate, so just eat the fortunate meal."" Which would be the chicken and rice. She blew it off with a, ""Girl, anyway..."" and said she only eats twice a day, so that would be dinner. JUST THAT ONE SLICE OF PIZZA.

I believed that maybe she had a heavy breakfast and she wasn't as hungry then, perhaps more protein... You know? So I asked what she had for breakfast, because that would lessen my concern if she had a heavy breakfast or something, again, I'm a concerned friend of multiple years, especially since she's losing weight. All she had was coffee, two sausages, and a cheese stick---- like excuse me? It would've been smarter to eat the chicken and rice then- there's no way she isn't hungry when she ate early in the morning, and it's 8 pm. AGAIN, that's concerning since she's losing weight, so I ask if she's eating within her calorie deficit- that hardly seems to be half of what she should be eating--- she had said it was fine and that the breakfast was light, but she was full. I had already sent my voice message about that seeming a bit iffy, but in the end said ""Well, okay."" because do you. (Mind you, we talk about this stuff, it's not new or anything)

She then sent an entire paragraph about how I was grilling her and questioning her like a child, and it was making her uncomfortable. HUH?! That was confusing in itself, because how could simple questions about what she ate be uncomfortable for her? Especially when she says what she eats all the time?? I only wanted her to expand on what she ate today, for her to think that eating a slice of pizza instead of chicken and rice was the better option. Mind you, I've always been the way I am, but never rude or insensitive or coming at her like a child. My questions are always for clarification-- and we're literally adults now, so I'll be as clear as I can when talking to someone, I never beat around the bush.

So, AITAH, for asking the question in the first place? Am I actually in the wrong, but don't see it?

I‚Äôve had this eye twitch in my right eyelid only for months.  It goes away and then comes back. The last week it‚Äôs been way more prevalent and comes and goes several times a day. When I sneeze, yawn, blink too hard etc. 

Should I be concerned with this? It‚Äôs starting to make me wonder if I need to be checked out. It hasn‚Äôt spread to other parts of my face or body. It doesn‚Äôt close completely, no vision changes. Just very annoying. Is this normal? Stress? Vitamin deficiency? Anxiety? 

I am a coffee drinker. I have 1 cup a day in the morning and then the only thing I drink is water. No alcohol or anything else. My diet is pretty clean as I‚Äôve really worked hard the last several months on cleaning up my diet, high protein, exercise daily.

[[explore Top Rated pallet compost on Amazon.]](https://site.trendsupplier.com/clearance-products/?kw=pallet compost)

## Key Features Analysis

The effectiveness of a pallet compost system relies on thoughtful design and implementation.

**Durable Construction:** The inherent strength of wooden pallets contributes to the longevity of the compost bin. Well-constructed pallet compost bins can withstand years of use, enduring various weather conditions and the ample weight of decomposing materials. choosing pallets made from rot-resistant wood further extends their lifespan.

**Modular Design:** Pallet compost bins are inherently modular, allowing for customization and expansion. Individual pallet sections can be easily added or removed, enabling adjustment of the bin's capacity to match changing composting needs. This adaptability makes pallet composting a flexible solution for gardens of all sizes.

**Aeration Optimization:** Proper aeration is crucial for efficient composting. Pallet compost bins facilitate airflow through the gaps between the wooden slats. This aeration promotes the activity of aerobic bacteria, accelerating the decomposition process and minimizing unpleasant odors. Regular turning of the compost materials further enhances aeration.

**Enduring Material Use:** Repurposing wooden pallets diverts them from landfills and promotes a circular economy. By utilizing this readily available waste material, pallet composting reduces environmental impact and minimizes the need for new resources. Sourcing pallets responsibly,ensuring they are free from harmful chemicals,is essential.

**Thermal Insulation:** wood, while not the best insulator, does offer some degree of thermal insulation.This can be beneficial in colder climates, helping to retain heat within the compost pile and sustain the decomposition process through cooler months. Insulation becomes particularly important when attempting to compost during winter.

## Core Benefits

Implementing a pallet compost system offers significant benefits for both gardeners and the surroundings.

**Reduced Waste:** Pallet composting allows for the efficient recycling of organic waste. By composting food scraps, yard waste, and other biodegradable materials, you can significantly reduce the amount of trash sent to landfills. This not only diverts waste but also reduces greenhouse gas emissions associated with landfill decomposition.

**Improved Soil Health:** Compost produced in a pallet compost system is a valuable soil amendment. It enriches the soil with nutrients,improves its structure,and enhances its water-holding capacity. This results in healthier plants, increased yields, and reduced reliance on chemical fertilizers.**Cost Savings:** composting reduces the need to purchase commercially produced fertilizers and soil amendments. By generating your own compost, you can save money on gardening supplies.Furthermore, using repurposed pallets minimizes the initial investment in composting infrastructure.

**Environmentally Friendly Practice:** Pallet composting is an environmentally responsible gardening practice. it reduces waste, conserves resources, and promotes sustainable soil management. By adopting this method, you actively contribute to a healthier planet.

## FAQs Section

**Where can I find wooden pallets for composting?**
Wooden pallets can frequently enough be obtained for free or at a low cost from various sources. Businesses such as retail stores, construction sites, and warehouses frequently have surplus pallets they are willing to give away. Always inquire about the pallet's history to ensure it hasn't been treated with harmful chemicals. Pallets marked with ""HT"" (heat treated) are generally safe for composting. Avoid using pallets marked with ""MB"" (methyl bromide), as this is a toxic fumigant.

**How should I prepare pallets for building a compost bin?**
Before constructing your compost bin, thoroughly inspect the pallets for any loose nails, splintered wood, or other hazards. Remove any protruding nails or staples to prevent injury. If necessary, sand down rough edges or splintered areas. Cleaning the pallets with a brush and water can definitely help remove dirt and debris.

**What materials can I compost in a pallet compost bin?**
A wide variety of organic materials can be composted in a pallet compost bin. This includes food scraps (fruits, vegetables, coffee grounds, tea bags), yard waste (leaves, grass clippings, small twigs), and paper products (shredded newspaper, cardboard). Avoid composting meat,dairy,oily foods,and diseased plants,as these can attract pests or hinder the composting process.

**How long does it take to produce compost in a pallet compost bin?**
The composting process can take anywhere from a few months to a year, depending on several factors. These factors include the type of materials being composted, the moisture level of the compost pile, the amount of aeration, and the ambient temperature. Regularly turning the compost pile and maintaining adequate moisture can accelerate decomposition.

(Glendale),"# TL;DR: Weekly summer jam sessions hosted at my house (drummer). All skill levels and genres welcome. Bring your own gear, chill vibes only. BYOB. Must provide ID before getting the address. Comment or DM if interested.

I'm a drummer and thinking about hosting a weekly jam at my house over the summer. I think it would be fun and a good way for this sub to network with each other in a more productive way.

# Time

* Day and time are TBD based on interest and availability. I am thinking of a 4-6 hour window, such as 2:00 p.m. - 8:00 p.m.
* Wanting to respect my neighbors, 8:00 p.m. is the latest I feel comfortable going full volume.
* Weekends prefered, but if weekdays are best for the most people, then it will be weekdays. I'm not opposed to having two jams a week, but would prefer to focus on one for now.

# Backline

* Drums would be provided (obviously). It's a good kit and everything is mic'd up.
   * Link to kit pic --> [Click here](https://imgur.com/a/nfjCFAK)
   * Drummers can bring their own gear and switch things out (snares, kick pedal, etc.)
      * I have a double pedal available (some kind of Speed Cobra). If you don't like longboards, I have a DW9000 single pedal available.
      * I have a few different snares that can be switched out, but my main snare is a Black Beauty \[8 (depth) x14 (width)\].
* I have a PA for vox/keys/etc. I do not have a keyboard, but I can throw up a mic for vox if told ahead of time.
   * If you have a mic and stand, that would help, as I am currently using all my mics and stands on the drum kit.
* I have another piece of gear that can be used as an additional monitor or amp ([One of these things.](https://www.guitarcenter.com/Roland/Cube-Street-EX-Battery-Powered-Stereo-Guitar-Amplifier-1393862859726.gc?source=4WWRWXGG&utm_medium=paid-search&utm_channel=paid-search&utm_source=google&utm_platform=google&utm_campaign=GC_G_NTM_SEM-STD_N_Amps-Effects_Brand_Amps&utm_ct=ntm&utm_tactic=prospecting&utm_segment=amp-effect&utm_term=roland%20cube%20street%20ex%20stereo&utm_content=694784471204&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=17252354871&gbraid=0AAAAADtcCuy7iKmPPIClpZsFwxGh1EbUI&gclid=Cj0KCQjwxo_CBhDbARIsADWpDH6Mspc1J5FhoEDcAQhTYQqjmIMqhwCo7DL6vCknePbQRlEVL1UrijEaArwmEALw_wcB))
* I have recording gear, so if people bring a DI or DI capable gear, it can be plugged in (I have 7 unused channels). I think it would be great to record the jams.
* I have a looper pedal if needed.

# ""Amenities""

* Everything is in my living room, so it's air conditioned and there's enough room for everyone.
* I have a pool, if that interests you.
   * Please shower at home before using the pool.
   * Please bring your own towel.
* I am 420 friendly.
   * I don't mind if you smoke inside, but if anyone has a sensitivity to smoke, I will ask that you smoke outside to be considerate.
* BYOB
   * I just ask that you drink in moderation and know your limits.
   * Drunk driving is very frowned upon. Get a taxi if you need one. (If I say you need one, you need one.)
* No illegal substances, please. What you do privately is your business‚Äîjust don‚Äôt make it my problem.
* Tobacco smoke must be kept outside and butts must be properly disposed of in the ashtray.
* There won‚Äôt be food provided, so please eat before or feel free to bring something to share. There will be coffee and ice water available.

# ""Requirements""

* No minimum skill level
   * This is supposed to be fun. Don't worry about being ""good.""
* Expectations
   * All participants will treat everyone with respect.
      * This includes my neighbors. They are very cool and tolerant of noise, but that is not a justification for unnecessary excessive volume.
   * All participants will treat all gear with reasonable care and respect.

1l60qnq,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1l60qnq/confused_over_coworker_i_like_this_is_gonna_be_a/,Confused over coworker I like (this is gonna be a long one guys),"So I work at as an admin at a sales office in a big city and have had a crush on my coworker for some time now. I‚Äôm a 27M and she‚Äôs a 28F. When I first met her I wasn‚Äôt interested in her. She seemed nice but was always quiet and kind of closed off. I‚Äôm the same way. She‚Äôs also in and out a lot. The sales people are independent contractors and aren‚Äôt required to come in. She has stretches where she works and doesn‚Äôt work. 

Over time I started making a point to talk to her more and realized I kind of liked her. We had a company bbq and we both went. I talked to her more there. It was a good time. She started coming around a bit more and started approaching me more. Asking work related questions but also lingering by my desk a lot. There was one day when I got off and she was still in the office. Everyone else had left so I stayed and talked to her. We talked for three hours. She was telling me where she was from, how she got to the city we live in after a recent break up, things like that. She mentions how she needs to take the bus home but I see the bus pass several times. I‚Äôm taking this a good sign so far. She does end up leaving and I‚Äôm feeling ecstatic about it.

I ask my roommates (who are both girls) for advice on what to do. They tell me next time I see her I should ask her to hang out outside of work. She doesn‚Äôt come in a for about a month after this. I‚Äôm feeling a little antsy at this point. One of my work friends says I should just call her and ask her to hang out. I‚Äôm hesitant to do this because I don‚Äôt want to come on too strong and scare her off. That‚Äôs not my personality. 

One day she does come in and to pick up a form for a client. She seems a little off. For context she does smoke a lot of weed for anxiety and health issues. She probably just smoked before coming in. She grabs the form and sits for a while at the table next to me. I wanted to ask her to hang out but was too nervous. There were other people in the room, it didn‚Äôt seem like the right time. She then randomly gets and leaves without saying anything. My work friend sees this all happen and tells me to go outside to catch her before she leaves. I go outside and she‚Äôs already gone. He tells me I should just call her today. After going back and forth I try calling her before I leave. She doesn‚Äôt pick so I just text asking if she‚Äôs free and wants to get food with me tonight. She doesn‚Äôt respond for almost 24 hours. When she does she tells me that she thought she already responded but had plans yesterday and thanked for me asking. I‚Äôm a little let down and take this a possible soft rejection. My roommates tell me I made the wrong move and that maybe I can try again when I see her in the office. I also take a day to respond and just say no worries, I wasn‚Äôt at all sure what to say. 

At this point I‚Äôm nervous for whenever she comes in again. I feel like I blew it and now‚Äôs it awkward. I tell another work friend about the situation, let‚Äôs call him T. T tells me she has a long term boyfriend. I had no clue at all. T says she probably told him because he‚Äôs a gay man and felt more comfortable. I‚Äôm not sure. I feel like an idiot but she also never mentioned that to me. I‚Äôve never heard her bring it up. She told me him at the bbq we had one but I wasn‚Äôt with them at that second. Maybe she got back together with the guy she broke up with. I‚Äôm glad to have closure but I also feel like an asshole.

She does eventually come in for an office meeting. I avoid talking to her out of embarrassment. I know that I need to make it not awkward but at this point I feel like I just need to leave her alone. She comes in here and there and still no talking. We‚Äôre avoiding each other which just makes it more awkward. Over time though we do start talking again. One day it was just the two of us the after my boss and left I made a joke about how happy I was he finally left for the day. She laughed and we stated talking like we used to. At this point I know nothing will happen but I‚Äôm glad we can still talk and be friendly.

We have a work party about two months later and she comes. I‚Äôm talking with her a bit and sitting with her. We‚Äôre both shy in these situations so we stuck together. I get up to grab a drink and T tells me that she‚Äôs single now. He was asking how she was and she told him she was down because her boyfriend broke up with her. I was very surprised about this. She‚Äôs now single. I wasn‚Äôt sure what to do but I knew I wanted to feel things out. I also needed to be careful considering what happened last time. We keep talking. We‚Äôre both smiling and laughing a lot at each other. Once the party is over we all go out to a bar. We sat by the piano and I‚Äôm stealing glances at her and smiling. I go to the bathroom and when I come back up she‚Äôs talking to another girl we work with. They‚Äôre talking about her breakup. She‚Äôs saying how it was a long distance relationship and she‚Äôs only ever done long term. She‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt really date but figures she should try now. Our coworker turns around and asks me if I‚Äôm seeing anyone. I say no and they both just smile. My crush says she‚Äôs going to a dispensary down the street to grab a joint. When she gets back I look out at her and she motions for me to join her. I took a few hits and we‚Äôre talking more. I mention how I have girl roommates (I feel it‚Äôs a good disarming tactic). She surprised but intrigued about that. Soon after we get in an uber to go back to the office and then head home from  there. She does offer me a ride but we live in opposite directions. I wish I just said yes.

I‚Äôm waiting now to see when she‚Äôll come to the office again. Weeks pass and she doesn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm trying to figure out what to do. We had such a  good interaction at the party. T suggests we make a plan and invite her to come. I don‚Äôt think I should do one on one at this point. A group setting would be better and less pressure on her. We decide to go the dog park as we all have one. T asks her for me and she immediately says yes to coming. The day comes to go but while I‚Äôm on the way T checks in with her and she says she can‚Äôt make it anymore. She went out of town earlier in the week and got stuck out where she was. I‚Äôm let down of course. We try pushing for next week but since he‚Äôs messaging her on our work app and she doesn‚Äôt see it in time. She barely checks it. 

My roommate suggests I invite my crush to her birthday party. T is supposed to be coming as well since he‚Äôs friends with my roommate so this could be a good idea. I ask her to come and she takes a few hours to respond but hearts my message and says she‚Äôll come. I give her the details for the party the next day. The day of the party comes and I text her telling her to let me know when she‚Äôs there so I can let her in. She responds saying she‚Äôs so stupid and has a relative visiting today. I don‚Äôt take this well, my first thought is that‚Äôs she making an excuse to not come. My roommate tells me not to worry too much about it. I respond saying no worries maybe another time. She texts back apologizing and that she probably looks like a flake but to invite her to whatever I‚Äôm doing next. I‚Äôm feeling much better and tell her I‚Äôll hit her up soon.

I‚Äôm beaming the next day. I‚Äôm finally in a good place with this girl. My sister calls me to check in and I tell her about this girl. She‚Äôs asking about what the girl said and I figure I‚Äôll just send a screenshot it make it easier. I fuck up and send it to my crush on an accident. She texts me: ‚ÄúLMAO I saw that‚Äù. She then sends me a picture of her relative eating pizza and says ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs me with her yesterday if you don‚Äôt believe meee‚Äù. I‚Äôm freaking out now. My sister thinks she‚Äôs mad and tries to calm me down. I ask my roommates for advice and they tell me I just have to laugh it off. They don‚Äôt thinks she‚Äôs mad. I say ‚Äúlol you got me üòÇüò≠‚Äù and she laughs at the message. I‚Äôm not sure where we stand now. I hope she‚Äôs not upset and wants to still see me. My roommates think I need to wait until I see her in person to talk to her again. I don‚Äôt like this idea since hasn‚Äôt been in the office for over a month. I don‚Äôt want to wait months to see her again. 

Two week pass and I go against my roommate‚Äôs advice. I ask her to get coffee that Saturday. She takes a day and a half to get back to me. I honestly thought it was over and she ghosted me. She hearts my message and says she‚Äôs definitely down to do that. I‚Äôm so happy about this. I finally get to spend time with her. 

I get to the coffee shop a little early and get us a table. She‚Äôs late because of her dog. We order and I pay for the coffee. We talked about work, what she‚Äôs been up to, funny stories, and really just catching up with each other. It seems to be going well. She asks if I want to go on a walk. I say yes and we walk to the park. We walk around for a bit and then just walk around the neighborhood. The conversation is going good. She says we should get a joint and we go to her local dispensary. We smoke half of it and walk around more. She finds this flea market and we go in. She‚Äôs making fun of the weird things there, I‚Äôm laughing and enjoying it. We eventually leave and are walking around again. It starts to feel like I should make my exit. We were together for almost four hours. She asks me how I‚Äôm going to get home. I‚Äôm not sure since I would have to take two subways or two buses to get back. I settle on taking a bike back (where live they have bike stands on the street where you can rent  e-bikes for cheap). She walks with me to the stand and messes around with one of the bikes. I‚Äôm watching her and smiling. She thanks for me inviting her and says she‚Äôll come to the office Monday to start working again. I say bye and that I‚Äôll see her Monday. I‚Äôm smiling all the way home. I‚Äôm feeling really good about this after all the ups and downs. She never brung up the screenshot and I didn‚Äôt mention it. Maybe I should have but it didn‚Äôt feel like the right time. I figured I would address another time. I just wanted to focus on having good time with her. When I got home I texted her saying I had a really fun time with her and would really like to this again. She didn‚Äôt respond. It‚Äôs now been a  week and she hasn‚Äôt said anything or come by the office. 

I‚Äôm very worried here. I feel like it went well and we left on a positive note. I thought she also had a good time. She made a point to tell me she‚Äôd see me Monday. Why do that if she didn‚Äôt have a good time? Did she think I just wanted to be friends and the follow up message changed things? I feel like it‚Äôs painfully clear I like her and want to spend time with her. I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs going on. I feel like she‚Äôs not sure what she wants, she‚Äôs still getting over her last relationship and maybe isn‚Äôt ready. I‚Äôm okay with that but I just wish she‚Äôd say something. I feel like I‚Äôm not asking her to be my girlfriend or even an actual date. I simply expressed I‚Äôd like to spend time with her again. Sorry for this very long post I‚Äôm just confused.

How does one balance ‚ÄúYES supplements‚Äù vs ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt need supplements, for goodness sake‚Äù PLUS all the other conflicting messages WHILE trying to actually eat something meaningful?  

I‚Äôm recovering from an injury and really struggling to regain my endurance, while working on getting my bed rest weight gone (and more).  I am SO exhausted, so often.  Before the injury/Oz, my busiest best moments were spent in the kitchen, making ‚Äòhealthy enough‚Äô food for my household.  I had to give up the reins when I was recovering and I don‚Äôt have any interest in getting back to it.  I‚Äôve tried meal kits, to up our veggie intake, and encourage others to cook them.  I‚Äôve tried protein drinks for me and leaving them to fend for themselves.  

What it comes down to is simple:  I don‚Äôt know how to eat, anymore.  And I don‚Äôt know how to shop for me to eat, anymore.  I always loved soup - it seems like a waste of stomach space now.  So, I wind up eating aged cheddar, Fruit Source bars (with veggies), some kind of fibre cereal (or Greek yogurt with granola), and a bunch of water, then ‚Äúsomething‚Äù for dinner, if I can manage it.  I take B12, Iron+VitC, Vit D PLUS my regular medications (which basically leaves me full before I even have breakfast).  I‚Äôm trying to add marine collagen to my coffee, but I don‚Äôt do it every day.  I‚Äôm trying to be sure I have the extra fibre, since I sometimes have to take Tylenol w codeine.

I like cheese, meat, berries, fruit, lots of different grains - but I don‚Äôt know how to turn what I like into ‚Äúthe right food to be eating so you have some energy and muscle left‚Äù.

Help?

I‚Äôve read a lot of suggested diets - most suggest egg bites, but I‚Äôm allergic to whole egg, so I can‚Äôt do that.

~ Different usernames, but same poetic energy. All posts are unusually well written, stylized, and cinematic. Not your usual random reddit post.
~ Brand tags like BK Coffee, Burger King or subtle geo hints are peppered throughout which we call as classic soft-seeding technique.

BK Coffee‚Äôs being marketed like it‚Äôs the offline version of a Lana Del Rey song. Whether it‚Äôs marketing, fiction, or art there‚Äôs a strategy behind the sentiment.

I‚Äôm a beginner in my practice. I don‚Äôt really consider myself particularly spiritual or religious, but I‚Äôve been feeling blocked recently and I stumbled upon a road opener spell that uses the following: 

- salt
- cinnamon powder
- orange candle 
- paper (I wrote my goals - which is career related), which I then lit on fire. I used the ashes, mixed with cinnamon. 

In a fire proof circular plate, I covered it with salt and created a plus sign, and then covered the ‚Äúroads‚Äù with the ashes of the paper and cinnamon powder. Then I lit an orange candle in the middle and watched it burn until it died. I poured coffee to douse the smoke after to contain the smoke. I buried the ingredients in the eastern corner of my building, near a cross road. 

I focused my intentions on clearing blockages regarding my career and smoothen my job search journey. I honestly did not feel anything happening, the ritual happened smoothly, but I didn‚Äôt get any ‚Äúgood‚Äù or ‚Äúbad‚Äù feeling about it. I did feel doubt about the efficacy of the spell while doing it, not really sure if this impacts the spellwork or not. 

Today I pulled few cards from my tarot card deck and i‚Äôm met with negative sentiment about my life in general. Lots of reversals, including a reversed Tower. 

I need guidance or resources as to how I can gauge the impact of this spell - how long until I know it‚Äôs working or not? Anything to keep in mind of?

I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection and engagement with another person.

I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul. All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you?

I'm 34, male, and live in the US (Michigan).

*I strive to engage in genuine and thoughtful discussion.* I seek people who generally know themselves and what they desire from and offer another. Being lost together is fun, but we each need a self to become lost. There's more than deliberate engagement and a handful of interests to what makes someone up, from mundane chatter to intense distress. Honestly striving to embrace and integrate the more grueling aspects of existence in a considerate way, while not being totally lost to them, is an attractive ideal of mine. I want people who show up as their real, authentic, messy selves, with a gaze that's elevated towards something majestic.

*Being high in abstraction, sensation, and an ability to experience things beyond the material is essential for me.* I want people with a vibrant imagination that are high in cognitive splendor. People who are genuinely weird and different are inherently interesting to me. I long for someone who can mirror me back, but sometimes a person with a wholly different perspective and axiom can see and mesh with you best. I peak with ideation and whimsy, desiring compatibility over a clone, and seek out others who do as well.

*Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.* I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics, which is inscribed onto one of the plaques I've placed above my abode in the Epistemic Wilderness. What does that mean? I deem nothing to be above reproach, and have actively sought out the most peculiar and obscure bits of knowledge possible since I was young. I seek peers in this and related endeavors.

*Creativity and artistry are important to me, and I appreciate and admire many different types and expressions of it.* Personally, I engage in more literary arts, in which I primarily write about my observations, thoughts, and lived experiences. I also adore writing conversationally, from chats to lengthy letters, and am not uncommonly poetic and intense when doing so. Photography also has a hold on me, and I hope to do more than just dabble in it as time goes on.

*More casual and practical hobbies of mine include incense, time pieces, archiving, organization, collecting, and coffee.* Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here.

*I'm INTJ, Type 5, score very high in openness and conscientiousness, and am a Virgo.* I list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find most of these sorts of metrics and tests to be largely bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people and have since I was young. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

Are we looking for each other? Are we capable of more in life from having met than never having crossed paths? Chat me up. Leave your hesitations and take the chance. Let me get to know you, from what within my ad resonated with you to what you're seeking, and a few basic details to initiate the start of a foundation. Dazzle me with your own signal, and let's see where the tides and winds take us.",0,1749346057.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,0.33,False

1l60gmv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l60gmv,"[REVIEW] Casa Prana at Lake Atitlan, Guatemala","**Where?** Casa Prana at Lake Atitlan in Guatemala

Lake Atitlan is a stunning volcanic area with Mayan villages dotted around the lake, many reachable only by boat. Casa Prana has no roads leading in or out, though we were told you could hike to Santa Cruz, about 15 minutes but steep uphill. The hotel provides boat service from Panajachel and a private transfer from the airport (you can't park anywhere, so you need to hire a driver). 3.5 hours of driving up and down narrow mountain roads or 30 minutes by helicopter. We arrived after 2pm which was too late for the helicopter. The helicopter was US$2200 I think, the car transfer US$280 if I recall correctly.

The property consists of several acres of luscious tropical gardens and cute hidden hangouts everywhere with hammocks, lawn chairs, and little tables. Since they only have a few rooms, it feels like you have most of the estate to yourself.

The area feels very safe, including all the towns. Our guide explained that these areas are controlled by the Mayan justice system which keeps a tighter rein on the situation than the feds.

**Things to do?** Casa Prana offers a variety of tours. If you're into hiking, you can hike the volcanoes with or without guides. They offer parasailing nearby. We chose to do the private coffee plantation tour which took about four hours. We rode standing in the back of a Jeep (they gave us a choice, we had fun) a few minutes from the dock to a tasting room, wandered the plantation, learned about the coffee beans and the research they were doing, had an opportunity to participate in the drying process, and then had a great tasting. The guide, Juan Carlos, speaks English very well and he's super laid back and friendly. He seems to know everyone in every Mayan town!

We also did the villages town, wandered past cute shops, saw art galleries, went to a coffee shop, participated in a weaving demonstration at a local women's coop, and we walked through a local market (no tourists anywhere there, very interesting), as well as visiting a cathedral whose bishop was murdered by the military policy for his popularity with the local Mayans decades ago during the civil war.

At the hotel, they have a volleyball court, ping pong, swimming pool, you can swim in the lake (the hotel is not near the towns so the water is clear, and it's warm), and they have a room with a TV and games, as well as a variety of spa options, yoga and meditation classes, and a gym with amazing views. We don't care about sports and spas, so we just did the tours, sat around reading books, and ate lots of food.

**Food?** The food was the only part we were less excited about. The service was excellent, super fast and everyone was very friendly. The iced coffees were great, as was the coconut toast in the morning (though some inconsistency, one day more dry and one day more eggy). The omelette had an odd aftertaste. All the dinner food was decent, the baked camembert was great, but we found everything quite bland. They do serve it with salt, pepper, and chilli pepper to add, but even things marked ""spicy"" on the menu were not remotely spicy. And we say that as pale white people from countries with bland foods. We also weren't a fan of the fact that last call is around 8.30pm and then you have no food/snack options until 7am (especially since there are no shops anywhere, and they say you can't bring food or drink onto the premises). There was a mini bar with a list of snacks but there were no snacks.

The delivery system was awesome though. You could sit at any of the gorgeous hidden locations around the property. Wherever you are, just send them a message on Whatsapp and they always respond immediately. Tell them your location or text a photo and they will bring you whatever you like from the extensive menu, including iced mochas.

**Amenities?** Beautiful sitting places, sports facilities, great pool at a comfortable temperature. The room amenities are lacking though. There's no A/C (though you don't need it, the lake is cool at night), no bath tub, no snacks or other food available between 9pm and 7am, and the shower head is really bad; we had to carefully tune it to be only partially on because it's too rough and goes in every direction; they need to buy new ones. Super cheap and easy upgrade they should make ASAP.

**Rating:** 9/10 

Ultimately, the property is absolutely gorgeous, as are the views. Easily one of the most beautiful places we've ever stayed, if not the most beautiful. Probably on par with Post Ranch Inn on the cliffs of Big Sur. The tours and staff are fantastic. Would have loved the helicopter option! The amenities aren't quite up to five stars though, and the car ride is a bit rough. Still, overall, an unforgettable stay that we highly recommend.",3,1749345956.0,FATTravel,0,0.81,False

Lunch: open faced turkey sandwhich, or protein yogurt with blueberries and granola.

Dinner: any number of things but try not to load too many carbs at dinner.

I barely drink any alcohol, and no soda or any other beverages. Water only for the most part. 

Is there something that I‚Äôm missing here? If I want a treat I‚Äôll usually eat some peanut butter and 1% milk.

# Why High-End Restaurants Are Serving [Guatemala](https://www.facebook.com/groups/lakeatitlanguatemalatravel) Premium Single Origin Microlot Coffee

In the fine dining world, every detail communicates something about your brand, from the locally sourced produce to the hand-forged steak knives. But one of the most overlooked opportunities to express quality, story, and sustainability is the last experience your guest has before leaving the table: coffee.

**At** [***SingleOriginMicrolot.com***](http://SingleOriginMicrolot.com)**,** we believe coffee should not be treated as a basic commodity or routine offering. Instead, it should be a premium, curated experience‚Äîa final signature touch that reflects the values of your establishment and leaves a lasting impression.

# From Commodity to Conversation Piece

Most restaurant coffee programs rely on mass-produced beans, anonymous blends, or inconsistent third-party suppliers. The result? A generic coffee experience that lacks depth, story, or any real connection to your brand.

We offer something fundamentally different:

* Single Origin Microlot Coffee, grown in high-altitude volcanic soil near Lake Atitl√°n, Guatemala
* Certified Organic and Glyphosate-Free
* Roasted fresh, shipped within five days of your order
* Sourced from one farm, one varietal, and one region, ensuring traceability and character
* Available in small, on-demand batches, eliminating waste and overstock

This is a coffee offering that not only elevates your menu but also aligns with your commitment to quality, transparency, and sustainability.",1,1749345696.0,EthicalFashionGuatema,0,0.99,False

Deep cleaning my room and washing all of my clothes on high heat. The jackets, wool sweaters, and special clothes that can‚Äôt be washed on high heat I want to dry clean but not sure where is good as I‚Äôve gone to places nearby that I found on Google Maps when I was living in Marylebone that have stained or ruined my clothes and taken no accountability for it. 



Prefer somewhere nearby, even better if they have a door to door service as I have A LOT that needs to be dry cleaned and I don‚Äôt have anyone who could help me so not sure how I‚Äôd bring them all. But open to figuring it out if any of you know a good dry cleaners that doesn‚Äôt do pick up/deliver. Student budget so reasonable pricing would be preferred as well, but I understand that may be difficult in Central London especially with door to door service. Would appreciate any suggestions!
