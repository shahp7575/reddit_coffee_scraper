1htkcm0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Costco/comments/1htkcm0/advice_on_keurig_machines_from_costco/,Advice on Keurig machines from Costco?,"About 18 months ago, I purchased a Keurig K-Supreme+ coffeemaker from Costco. About six months after purchase, I tried to do a regular ""descale"" (as indicated on the machine). I used the Keurig brand descaling solution and the Keurig rinse pods (to clean the needles). However, it essentially stopped working during the process. Apparently, this is a known issue with this model.

So, I contacted Keurig (including the appropriate serial number). They sent a replacement (minus the additional items that came with the kit). It arrived a couple of weeks later.

The replacement machine has never really worked right. If I select a 12 ounce cup of coffee, I am lucky if it makes 9 ounces. If I select 10 ounces, it usually produces 7 or 8. We endured this for a few months. However, it started struggling even more.

Now, if I select a 12 oz cup to make my wife a cup of coffee, it might produce about 7 ounces. However, a subsequent cup (for me) will only produce about 2 ounces. I will repeat the process three times until it makes about six ounces.

I contacted Keurig about this and they said that they couldn't help me because it was replacement (even though it was still within the one-year warranty). So, we just went along with it. Sometimes, the machine would surprise me and make an 8 oz cup the first time and a 6 oz cup for the second cup. Most of the time, it's still the same old, same old.

I've tried everything to fix this. I've used the paper clip to clean the needles (which are clean). I've descaled it every month despite having some of the cleanest drinking water in America (we live in Palo Alto, California and our tap water comes from Hetch Hetchy reservoir at Yosemite).

Today, I did yet another descaling. It's just as problematic as ever. And, now, the plastic has changed its color in the K-Cup holder area (which is what happened in the first Keurig K-Supreme+ issue). In fact, the coffee sometimes gives off a ""burnt plastic"" smell.

Hence, my question:

**Can I actually return this to Costco?**

**Should I buy a different Keurig model at Costco?**

I don't take many things back at Costco (maybe a total of four returns in ten years). I am just really frustrated by Keurig. I'm not sure if I want to buy another one. I might simply buy a different brand.

It's just that the K-Supreme+ was a replacement for another model that died after about a year (we didn't return it). Oddly enough, I had an older Keurig that lasted for at least five years before we simply gave it away to a neighbor. She was still using it a few years later when she moved.",2,1736014152.0,Costco,1,1.0,False

1htkbdt,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1htkbdt,Our No-Spend Goals for 2025,"My partner and I have put together our No Spend Guidelines for 2025. I did a No Spend month May of 2024 and actually loved it. I found myself getting a lot more resourceful and creative and the challenge of ""how"" to make something happen without spending money on it sort of gamified the experience, which I hadn't anticipated.

Example: wanted a teapot cozy and my first reaction was to go on Etsy to buy a knitting pattern. Then because it was my no-spend month I had to think of a different way to obtain a pattern. Had the idea to look for free patterns online and then even better, asked some knitting friends if they had patterns they could share - sparking some fun catch ups about projects, our families, and lives (unexpected positive consequences of no-spend = connecting with loved ones instead of Amazon).

Our main motivator is SPITE. We are so tired of the consumerism addiction, and the greed/destruction of big corporations like Amazon/fast fashion. Our primary goal is to protest Big Corporation, with the side bonuses of saving money and reducing consumption. 

It's also been helpful to be clear on how we will spend WHEN we spend. See first few lines.

We live on a small island that has limited access to even secondhand goods but I feel morally sound supporting local shops because so much of each dollar stays local and circulates in the form of wages, commerce, taxes, and local economics.

We may adjust a few things, like ""no new books"" because I am an avid reader, our local library has a very limited supply, and I love our local bookstores. But I'll always try library first, then used bookstore, then local bookstore.

Does anyone else have No Spend guidelines they can share? We built this off of what we wanted to reduce OR what we didn't value spending on. 

Very stoked to have found this forum!

What're your off-event goals for the new year? Anything exciting? Anything you really want to accomplish? I have a couple on hand I'm already starting.

1. **Hoard as many Dream Cluster S and M as I can for an emergency fund (Off-event):** Between all the candy boosts and Cram-o-Matic gambling hitting my wallet, I don't want to be without in case I run into a mon I want to evolve suddenly and have enough candy for, like a hard hitting ginger TTar.

I won't be buying bundles to grab easy clusters because they're just a waste compared to event bundles imo, so rng's taking the wheel on this.
2. **Finish my 2.6x Dream Shard nightly rotation:** Again, more passive income. I already have this going on Sunday with my DSB/RB team, but the general upkeep will help keep me out of the red, especially concerning more expensive pot increases-- something I've never been a fan of.
3. **Get my ""black"" Charizard, ABB Golem, AAA Skeledirge, and AAA Abomasnow to level 50.**
4. **Finish capturing all of the ""heavy hitting"" ingredient mons for expensive dishes:** I still need eggs, coffee, and ginger badly.
5. **Max out my Golduck and Drifblim's main skills,** then slowly work on Raikou and Entei now that Suicune's been done since October.",2,1736013980.0,PokemonSleep,0,1.0,False

My boyfriend broke up with me after three years together, claiming he had a ""bad feeling"" and that he was wasting my time. Meanwhile, my friend keeps getting rejected by her FWB of four months, both situations happend before 2months. We decided to book a New Year’s trip together, but there's a problem: I find it really hard to talk about my feelings regarding my breakup, while she can talk for hours about her problems.
The day before New Year’s, she started talking about her situationship, and we were talking about it for two hours. I couldn’t take it anymore, so I told her I was going to take a shower. When I came back, she started again. I know it's hard for her too, but I thought we were going to focus on having a good time, not keep talking about our problems—and that's what I was trying to do.
On New Year’s Eve, when we were getting ready, she brought it up again. She decided that she was going to call her situationship at midnight, and I just looked at her and didn’t say anything. She’s a great girl—smart and pretty—but I just don’t understand her sometimes. After a few drinks, she mentioned again that she was going to call him, and I couldn’t listen anymore. I said, ""He didn’t even buy you a cup of coffee, he didn’t even try to get to know you. What are you talking about?"" Maybe that was harsh, but I feel like she doesn’t understand that I’m also going through something big in my life: my ex, the person I thought I was going to marry, ended our relationship out of the blue, and she just keeps talking about herself.
She was really angry after that and told me I needed to drink so I could finally tell her what I really think. I know we all deal with emotions differently, but I think she’s exaggerating. I told her, ""I can listen to you and give my opinion, but sometimes it’s too much for me, especially now. How can I tell you that I can’t keep talking about your stuff because I’m also in a difficult situation, but still expect you to talk about my problems and give me advice?""
I don’t know anymore. I don’t want to lose my best friend, but am I being selfish? Am I belittling her situation?

Me and my husband (both in our late 30s) met 5 years ago, and got married 2 years ago. A year prior to meeting me he broke up from his ex with whom they lived 6 years together and then broke up due to incompatibility, but they decided to stay friends. I know her. We sometimes meet her for a dinner or coffee. I was introduced to her after our wedding and initially i had no issues with their friendship with the exception of one incident, when he told me he's going to get drinks with frienda but went to a dinner in a restaurant with her and did not pick up my calls (we were on long distance at that point, and it was his birthday). Recently, however his ex is going through a breakup and she has spoke to him separately about the reasons of her break-up. In addition, sometimes they seem to get nostalgic, like her sending him links to places where they were together, or him checking her social media and playing her Christmas playlist while she was at our place. In addition, he still keeps her photos and sometimes calls me by her name and then jokes it off instead of apologizing. Recently, I have tried to set some boundaries and have told him I don't like them being nistalgic or her seeking his support during her breakup. His reaction was super defensive. He claims it is all my own insecurities and the fact that I was cheated upon before. In addition, he claims a similar behavior would not be appropriate for me, because i am not close with any of my ex boyfriends. And although we seem to have an agreement now that he will try to be more sensitive in the future, in my brain I cannot let it go. So my question is whether I am being unnecessarily jealous and dramatic or his behavior is indeed crossing boundaries and is disrespectful. ",1,1736013608.0,Marriage,1,0.99,False

1htk3sm,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1htk3sm/the_lavender_room_part_i/,The Lavender Room Part I,"I opened my mailbox, and pulled the small group of envelopes from within. I shuffled through the typical bills and junk, pausing when I came to a parcel that was different than the others. It was a small, rectangle, wrapped in a deep purple paper with small stars printed on it. It felt to me like those little gift card boxes that you can find at stores around the holidays. It looked like one as well, but was obviously a custom job, being the same color, with the same celestial design that the paper had on it. I opened the top and found a a plastic card inside as I expected.

There was no branding on the front of the glossy plastic object, and on the back there was a magnet strip like those along with an address. I typed that into google, but all of the information about the building said it was empty. The place was in an industrial area on the edge of the city, and I hesitated to go visit it. I went to work the ne next morning, the card beginning to fade from my memory. I only remembered it when I opened my wallet to buy a cup of coffee, the small plastic square catching my eye.

I pulled it from the card slot as I walked back out to my car, and tapped the address into my GPS. I was curious, I admit. That feeling only deepened as I neared the place and noticed that almost everything around it was shuttered, the lots empty and quiet. The only place that had cars parked outside was the one I had been invited to. I parked next to a rather expensive looking sports car and glanced around as I exited my car. I started toward what seemed to be the main entrance, but that was dark.

There was, however an arrow painted on the sidewalk. I followed the direction it was pointing. There was another arrow, then another. The trail led me to a door with a card reader above the knob. I extracted the card from my wallet and slid it through the slot on the electronic device. The light turned green and I heard a soft click. I reached out and turned the handle, and when I stepped through I could hear the faint murmur of conversation. I walked along the hallway in front of me coming to an intersection. The corridors to my left and right were blocked by rolling gates.

I continued toward the sound of voices which had been growing louder as I pushed further into the building. I arrived at a large room that looked completely out of place. There was an expensive looking carpet on the floor. There were large, overstuffed couches and chairs dotting the floorspace. Men and women lounged, drinks in their hands. There seemed to be a fully stocked bar on the western wall. A man near the counter seemed to notice me, and started walking in my direction. He was middle aged, and slightly taller than myself with slick silver hair.

He smiled as he drew nearer.

“First time here?” he enquired.

“Is it that obvious?” I asked in return.

“Not really, I just don't recognize you.” the tall man replied with a quiet chuckle.

“Is this your place?” I prodded, motioning to the lavish room around us.

“Oh, no. I'm what you might call the manager.” the slick-haired man replied, putting his arm around my shoulder, herding me toward the bar. I didn't resist, my legs moving at the other man's pace. When we reached the counter he ordered two beers.

The bartender placed a bottle in front of each of us and popped the top right there on the counter. There were no labels on the bottles, either, I gave my host a quick glance, and tried to bite my tongue, not wanting to ask a stupid question, but my curiosity got the better of me.

“What is this place?” I asked.

The man smiled and rolled his shoulders in a slight shrug. “It's a club of sorts. I am not at liberty to say much more than that.”

I felt my eyelid twitch. This whole situation wasn't just strange, it was wrong. A posh clubhouse inside an abandoned factory? In what world did that make any sense? I took another sip of the beer. It was good. I was about to ask another question when *He* walked in. There was no question that this was the owner of the place from the moment one saw him. Dressed in an expensive, likely custom black suit with a rich purple shirt and a tie a few shades lighter than the shirt. He seemed to radiate an aura of respect.

His emerald green eyes were clear and bright, his hair a light brown with subtle red highlights. I watched the man as he stopped to talk to a small group of people sitting at the other end of the room.

“That would be the man who runs this establishment. If you want to know more, then I suggest speaking with him. Don't be intimidated, he is quite approachable.” the manager said when he noticed that I was staring.

That broke whatever had come over me, and my eyes blinked. I took another drink of the beer and then started moving in the owner's direction. He seemed to sense my approach, eyes moving toward me even while he was still in the middle of a conversation.

“Are you new?” he asked, and I thought I saw a faint glimmer in his green eyes.

“Yes, it's my first time here.” I answered.

“Let me show you around.” the man in the purple shirt and dark suit offered with a smile.

“There's more to this place?” I blurted.

The other people around us, who I had practically forgotten about laughed, and the owner of the place chuckled again as well.

“A whole lot more. Come, this way.” he said, then stepped past me.

I pivoted and followed, brushing off the minor embarrassment I had felt a moment before. The other man led me to a door that I hadn't noticed before on the other side of the bar. That opened onto a set of utilitarian looking stairs that descended into a dimly lit space below. I followed the man in the suit down and again I couldn't believe what I was seeing. It was a betting parlor, complete with banks of screens on each wall.

“Is this legal?” I asked, and the owner laughed, a single, loud guffaw, as if I had caught him off guard. I blinked.

“Of course. I have all the necessary licenses.” he replied with a grin.

I felt a touch of relief. We didn't stop there, the stranger leading me down another flight of stairs and as we approached the large metal door I could hear the pounding of music. There was a full on nightclub on the third level.

“This concludes our tour, and welcome to the Lavender Room.” my host said jubilantly, voice just loud enough to be heard over the music.

With that, the mysterious man turned and walked away. I wandered back up the stairs to the gambling area, glancing at my phone. It was already five in the evening. Time seemed to be flying, but I decided to play a few hands of Blackjack. From there I went and danced for a while. Before I knew it, the hour had slipped past midnight. I couldn't believe that six hours had gone by, and on top of that, I was actually up, though I didn't spend the whole time playing cards. I took a few chances on the roulette wheel as well, and had actually won. I went home, and fell into a deep, dreamless sleep.

As soon as my eyes opened late the next morning, I felt a temptation to return to the place I had been the night before. I also knew that I couldn't go straight back there. I had to go to work for one thing. For another, my stomach was so empty that I felt nauseous. I ate a rather large breakfast and went through the rest of my morning routine. I was almost late by the time I pulled out of my driveway. I was distracted while working, my mind drifting back to the place I had been the night before. The man who had given me the tour had appeared in my mind often as well.

As soon as I clocked out, I drove toward the mostly abandoned portion of the city. To my surprise, there was more traffic and more cars in the small lots. The lot outside the Lavender Room was a little more occupied as well. The first floor was practically a ghost town, only a few people sitting on the scattered furniture, so I proceeded lower. The betting room was nearly too packed to move, and there were several sporting events happening on the wall of monitors, and I took the opportunity to place a bet before sitting in one of the booths.

An attractive woman approached after a few minutes.

“Would you like a menu, sir?” the server asked, and I blinked.

“Sure.” I replied.

She nodded and disappeared for less than a minute. She returned with a small, laminated pamphlet, laying that in front of me, walking away again. I picked it up and skimmed over the choices, settling on a burger and a bottle of house-brewed beer. I had assumed that was what came in the unlabeled bottle I had been given the night before. My suspicion was confirmed when my items arrived at the table. I ate quickly and just as rapidly lost the money on the team I placed a bet on after my dinner. I was disappointed but not totally defeated as I sat at the roulette table.

I placed a five dollar bill on the table and was given a single chip in return. I placed that on 32 red. To my surprise, the ball bounced into that slot. I placed both chips on another number, red again. And I won. Four spins later, and I had recouped my losses from the football game. I lost track of time again, sipping the house-brewed beer and playing different table games until well after midnight again. The next morning brought a vicious hangover that led me to take the day off from work. I spent most of the early morning trying to rid myself of the headache.

A few doses of ibuprofen helped, and as soon as I felt stable enough to eat, I did so, already mentally retreating to the Lavender Room. I closed my eyes and felt like I was there. I could smell the mixture of cologne and perfumes that lingered in the air. I could hear the faint music playing through the hidden speakers, and for a moment, even smelled smoke. That part wasn't a dream. I opened my eyes to find flickering light beyond my partially open doorway. I sat up and scrambled to grab my wallet and phone as well as a change of clothes, then climbed through my bedroom window.

Once outside and safely on the sidewalk, I called the fire department. After they arrived and spoke to me, I was advised to leave during the investigation, but not to leave town. I considered renting a room, then decided I would go to the Lavender Room instead, and if it was closed as I suspected, I would sleep in the back seat of my car. To my surprise there were still vehicles in the lot. I entered the place and descended the first set of stairs. I needed a drink. I sat at the nearly empty bar and a bartender quickly appeared.

I ordered a shot of whiskey, and he quickly obliged. I ordered another and then another in rapid succession. I had built a rather decent buzz quickly, and was about to order another drink when I became aware of someone standing slightly behind me. I turned to see the man who had called himself the manager upon our first meeting.

“You're becoming a little bit of a regular.” he said.

I nodded and rolled my shoulders in a sort of shrug.

“I guess so.” I finally replied.

“Is something wrong?” the man asked as I ordered another drink.

“My house caught fire, and I didn't know where else to go.” I confessed without thinking.

The man's eyes widened.

“That's just dreadful.” he gasped. “How did it happen?”

“I still don't know the answer to that, and I get the feeling I am a suspect.” I answered bitterly.

I was just signaling the bartender, when the man placed his hand on my forearm, gently pressing it back to the top of the counter.

“We have a few rooms for rent, if you need a place to stay.” the man informed me.

“Rooms? I don't remember that being part of the tour.” I said, still not quite drunk enough to be incoherent.

He laughed.

“They are not public knowledge, but most of the people here at this hour live here, anyway.” he told me with a grin.

He led me through a set of double doors marked 'Employees Only' and then down a set of stairs beyond what appeared to be a food storage pantry. We descended for more than one level, but there was no landing, or door between the top and bottom of the steps. I was shocked by the interior of the room below the structure. It looked like the lobby of a real estate office, with art on the walls, brass fixtures and a dark wooden desk where a woman in a pantsuit sat. She smiled when she saw us approaching.

“Got a new resident?” she asked with a gentle smile, her eyes on the manager rather than me.

“Short term, I believe.” he said and the woman's smile grew as she turned her attention to me.

“May I have your identification and credit card?” she asked, and after tapping my information into the system she glanced toward me.

“Do you want to stay for a night or longer?' she asked.

“At least three nights.” I replied.

As soon as I got into my room, I fell into an exhausted sleep. The next day I didn't leave except to eat at the club on the top floor. Before I knew it, it had been a week, and I had been fired. I didn't care. I still had the insurance money coming in, as I had been cleared of any wrong doing. Before long, I had forgotten about the outside world. At some point I began working here, I don't even know how.

1htk3lt,https://www.reddit.com/r/SabbaticalPlanning/comments/1htk3lt/selffunded_sabbatical_plan_with_budget_tips/,Self-funded sabbatical plan with budget tips!,"In one month I’ll be taking a one year, self-funded sabbatical after working all of my adult life. I had a weird job dissecting body parts in a pathology lab that I actually liked until a few years ago, when I realized I couldn’t work and write at the same time. So I put in my resignation notice with the plan to take a year off of work. However, that notice came with a year of pre-planning and budgeting. I wanted to share what I did in case others are considering the same thing.

To put things in perspective, I’m an average married middle, middle aged class American homeowner in a high cost of living area. I have had the advantage of not having kids, having purchased a home before homes were unpurchasable, working long enough to have paid off my student loans, and driving a POS car that is also paid off and somehow still works, so some of this advice may not be relevant to your needs, but some of it is universal. Here’s what I did to budget for a one year, self-funded sabbatical.

**Sit down and make a plan**

My husband is newly self-employed so his income is highly variable and not something we can depend on at this point. We had to make a plan that included health care and wasn’t reliant on his income. Other expenses included taxes for next year, the inevitable Unexpected Expenses, and Christmas. He came up with the amount we needed to save and we forged a simple plan: a spending goal for each month and tracking our spending. We used the [Spending Tracker app.](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/spending-tracker/id548615579) It’s simple, free and not too spammy- you just have to watch an ad every time you enter an item. It totals up your spending for the month and breaks down your spending into categories that you can add or edit, which is helpful to see where your money goes.

**Execute the Budget and Avoid Pitfalls**

The first month was deliberately experimental to see where our money was going. We weren’t budgeting yet, but tracked everything so we knew what we needed to adjust. The biggest expense was going out to eat. I didn’t think we went out to eat that much, but wow, does it add up! The second biggest expense was Crap I Didn’t Really Need from the Internet. That one was easy to eliminate. Cutting back on going out to eat was a bit harder because meeting for dinner is how most of our friends socialize. So I just stopped socializing for the most part with the understanding that I’ll make up for it during the sabbatical. I plan to volunteer and get involved with several local organizations, something I can’t do now because commuting and working late sucks away my time. Not socializing is really hard, so we replaced it with exercise. I latched on to my husband’s Planet Fitness membership which lets you bring a friend for free. It’s me. I am that friend.

Other things that suck to cut out but you probably should include clothes and vacations. Since you’re not socializing you don’t have to keep up with anyone and buy the latest fashions. I’m fortunate enough to wear scrubs to work, which don’t really need upgraded unless they get unmentionable body fluids or chemicals all over them. It happens, but thankfully not all that often. Not going on vacation has been the hardest part for me. The thing I love about going places is the exploration aspect, but I’ve been trying to stay occupied with various hobbies that replace my need to explore places with things. I still complain about it a lot and then remind myself, “suck it up, buttercup. You get a year off instead of a one week trip.”

If you’re a woman, you know about the pink tax, but fortunately, you aren’t socializing so you don’t have to look perfect all the time. You can do your own nails (or not do them at all like me), and cut back on getting your hair done. I see my hairdresser 3x a year and have her do the kind of blonde highlights that allow my roots to grow in without looking trashy. I admittedly am of the age where I get bacterial toxins injected into my face, but found a way to get deep discounts on it. I go through [Aesthetic Medical Training](https://aestheticmedicaltraining.com/) twice a year. They have a physician instructor explaining exactly where to inject and the students are medical professionals, so I felt very comfortable. Being a medical professional myself, it’s fun for me to teach others with my face. I like to joke and encourage them, “Go on, stab me in the glabella, it’s ok, it doesn’t hurt (much).“ The instructor says I am a textbook case so I guess that’s good?

Be aware of your shopping weaknesses. Some stores or brands are really good at getting you to buy things. You may have to just stay away or unfollow them temporarily. Out of sight, out of mind. This also sort of works for junk food (which you don’t need anyway). If you’re anything like me, stay the heck away from Sephora, Target, and don’t even think about going anywhere but the grocery store during Spooky Season (and even then you might become ensnared). Halloween stuff is my weakness. I’m just going to toot my horn now and proudly declare that I didn’t buy ANY skull decorations this year.

**Food Planning**

Groceries are going to be one of your largest monthly expenses. You may have the ability to coupon, and if so, go for it! Lots of people make it a game to see how much they can save. That could be fun, right? I personally don’t have the energy to coupon or shop sales because my life consists of going to work, going to the gym, going to sleep at a reasonable hour, then cooking, catching up on chores on the weekend, and maybe doing something fun or helpful to others. We found the best way to save money on groceries was to shop at Aldi. They actually carry decent quality meats. The produce selection is limited and not always great, so sometimes produce needs to come from somewhere else. I recommend Asian grocery stores for low cost produce. Produce stuff adds up more than meat but you really need lots of it in your life to stay healthy.

We’re not going out to eat, so this means packing lunches and meal prepping on the weekends. I can’t stress the importance of packing a lunch enough! In fact, I pack breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and carry around a very large purse brimming with meals. It’s really awkward, but it also helps me stay healthy. Staying healthy means saving even more money by not having to take meds and go to the doctors. Eating breakfast and dinner in the car is a small price to pay.

Incoming rant! It goes without saying that buying Starbuck$, et al every single day is stupid. It’s not like anyone even goes there to socialize, they just pick up their to-go drink with the rest of the to-go-drink-pickerupper masses and leave. How is this ritual even helping anyone have a better day? If you are socializing or doing work over coffee then that’s another thing. I get it, keep that up, I’m not talking about you.

I ended up quitting coffee (except for one a day week) and think it’s really made a difference in my reflux and anxiety levels.

**Motivating Yourself to Save All The Monies**

I’m ADHD and unmedicated, so all of this is HARD. But on the plus side, I get obsessed with completely random hobbies in which I have to acquire all the things. I used that tendency to create the motivational strategy of: if I save so much by this date in the month, I get to spend lots on FRAGRANCE INGREDIENTS! Fragrance is my latest obsession and I am hoping to start a little business with it next year in which people have to donate tons of money to cancer research in order to buy my smells. I have no idea how that’s going to work, but for right now I have to learn about thousands of scents, which means I need to save money every month to continuously acquire them. When I get that little box of smelly bottles in the mail, tear into it, and sniff all of the jars one by one, it brings a level of joy that’s indescribable. So I have been doing VERY good at saving.

**The Sabbatical Plan**

One month left and I shall be free! I still will be sticking to the budget plan during the sabbatical year, which will be even more of a challenge having free time but not money, so I also have a plan in place of how to spend my time. Every weekday is going to be divided into working out and writing in the morning, working on my smelly business in the afternoon, and going for a walk at lunch and in the summer evenings. I’ll also work occasionally, covering vacations for people at my current job and hopefully some other places. This might get me enough income to buy more perfume supplies (Eeee!). I’ll see my mom a lot. I plan to volunteer a few days a week doing something for cancer patients, and have joined a running club. I don’t care about running, but apparently people make friends doing it. I also am going to try to get more involved in my local mushroom club (another obsession of mine), and it would be cool to make some sabbatical friends here, but I have no idea if people even do that anymore.

If you are taking a sabbatical or doing budget stuff, I’d love to hear more about what you’re up to, so please drop a hello in the comments!",2,1736013522.0,SabbaticalPlanning,1,1.0,False

1htk2j8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/1htk2j8/my_bf_hasnt_worked_or_even_looked_for_a_job_in_6/,My bf hasn’t worked or even LOOKED for a job in 6 months while I’m 5 months pregnant working at Amazon warehouse . How do I just say fuck this and get myself out of this never ending pity party of existential anxiety and dread? ,"Currently sitting in my car missing my first shift at work because this is how my morning went…. Woke up with our 2 year old son and made him breakfast as I prepped my coffee. My bf wakes up and sits on the couch with our son and turns a show on for him. I make him coffee , spend an 45 minutes getting ready , then my bf complains that our son has been watching tv for an hour because I’m taking too long to get out the door (our son just wants me in the mornings ). 

He could have idk played blocks or cars with him? Took him into the bedroom to play? Anything. Nope it’s my fault he’s watching too much tv because I have to get ready for to work in some shitty dirty warehouse that I shouldn’t even be fucking working at 5 months pregnant?!? 

I have a bachelors degree in psych which doesn’t count for much but it’s a degree. I’ve applied to 20 positions in the behavioral health field and eventually gave up and took a seasonal job at Amazon because we literally had no income. Oh did I mention we live with his mom ? When he first lost his job I spent weeks redoing my resume, applying to jobs, writing cover letters, and even applied to grad school . And during that time he didn’t even apply to ONE job. Not one. It’s now been 6 months and still … hasn’t even looked. 

When I wake up with my son I’m in a great mood. Our son is always in such a good mood, happy, funny, goofy, cuddly, emanating pure love so my mornings with him are always a joy. Even if I got 4 hours of sleep, or have to work a 10 hour shift . As soon as my bf wakes up he spend the first hour being a fucking gloomy angsty dark cloud , as if it’s SO hard to face the day knowing u don’t have to go to some shitty job and get to spend the entire day with our son. 

We have couples counseling and the topic that is always brought up “[Xxxxx,  have you looked for a job? How does it make u feel not being employed while your gf works? “ … “shitty… it makes me feel like less of a man. “ Well … there’s a really simple solution to that not sure if you’ve considered this but maybe you should idk FIND A JOB?!? 

I’ve been patient , I’ve tried not caring, I’ve tried encouraging him to get into a trade . He’s an intelligent, capable, hardworking guy with a ton of potential. He’s worked in multiple hands on fields and has always done phenomenal work . 

We both have a lot of potential, but fucked around in our twenties and have both struggled with depression and trauma , and before I became pregnant with our son, we both struggled with substance abuse issues as well, as much as I hate to admit that. But once our son was in the picture, we both got sober. Once he was born, it was like this was what we had been waiting for our entire lives. There was no desire for either of us to go back to the lifestyle we were living , or rather suffering, before. 

And everything seemed to be going well until he lost his job. 

His friends dad literally told him he could get him into the pipefitters union. I just don’t get it. I do not understand being a father and not wanting to provide for your son who you love more than anything , for your family. During the months neither of us were working, his mom was literally buying my son diapers and necessities. I went through what little savings I had in a few months. I applied for food stamps so we could buy groceries. I couldn’t fucking taking it anymore … not being able to buy anything for our son so I , at 3 months pregnant, got a job at Amazon warehouse . But it’s not enough. And now I’m frantically trying to find a work from
Home job before our daughter arrives .

I’ve been planning on going back for my Masters in the fall , through an online program, which is absolutely vital now because I don’t see my bf ever being able to provide for us . His mom tried arguing that pursuing my masters right now is a bad idea … “how are u going to get ur masters with two kids? That’s too much , you need to just get a better job , you can make just as much money with a bachelors” 😂 are u that deluded?!?  Bachelors in psych jobs are $25 an hour , $30 max if you’re lucky. A masters is $60k minimum salary right out of school, even more once licensed. And lets not ignore the bigger issue at hand - instead of telling me I won’t be able to pursue the career I’ve wanted since 20 years old, why don’t you stop enabling and coddling your adult  son and using “oh don’t worry he’ll get a job soon” as a means to comfort me when I’m fed the fuck up? 

I’m 34 years old even if I go back to school part time I probably wouldn’t even be done and licensed until I’m 40+. So No, I can’t fucking wait . And I refuse to sit around and wait for my bfs empty promises that “everything will be fine once I get a job” that I’ve been hearing for 6 months. And even if he did get a job I’d be a miracle if he even lasted more than a year before says fuck it and quits or decides he’d rather just stay at home with our son and let his mommy pay for everything. 

I could go on and on. Before I had my son, I had my own handmade clothing business. Organic cotton and hemp fabrics that I designed from scratch and hand dyed , unique one of a kind creations. I loved doing it and was gaining a decent customer base before I had to “take a break” and traded in my passions to become a mom. I have been designing clothing since I was 8 years old. I even still have my original drawings . My art was what defined me as a person all of my life and I had to make the decision to give up that dream to pursue a more stable career in mental health , which although I have always been passionate about , I cannot imagine my life without creating - painting, sewing, crocheting, dancing (movement therapy), even spinning fire props. All of my biggest passions traded in. For motherhood which I’m sure many of you can relate . Having to give up or take a break from something you used to love doing, because being a mom is a full time career in itself . 

This isn’t the life I wanted and maybe it’s my own fault for fucking around in my twenties but now it’s like I’m succumbing to the existential anxiety of never amounting to anything, now not just for myself but for my children. 

I don’t know what I’m looking for by posting this here. Maybe im looking for someone to tell me “chin up buttercup, find the strength to overcome the fear of the unknown and don’t give up on your dreams “. Or “get your shit together and focus on yourself and your son”. 

You may ask “why are you even still with him?” Aside from the not working, he really is an incredible father to our son. He’s present , and patient with him. He plays with him for hours a day. There’s evenings where I hear him for over an hour doing the voices for my son’s stuffies , playing the voices of both Kermit and Dobby, which my son adores. 

But all the while he’s playing with our son, I’m doing laundry, dishes.. I’m literally doing 95% of the housework in a house of 4 adults , 4 cats and 1 dog (his 22 year old brother lives there as well). Up until i got pregnant, I was the ONLY person cleaning the litter boxes of FOUR cats. If I didn’t do it, they would literally go 3-4 weeks without getting cleaned. There was a point recently when the entire basement reeked of cat urine , because it had been weeks since anyone had cleaned them, and everyone’s just nonchalantly doing laundry down there , ignoring the stench . 
All the while my bfs mom gives their cats treats on the KITCHEN COUNTERS where we prep food . Where I prep food for our son. 

I’m the only one , in the 2 years I’ve lived here, who cleans the bathroom, the toilet, the microwave, the stove , the floors. I’m the only person who vacuums up the insane amount of pet hair every day. Or washes the towels. Or does any sort of deep cleaning tasks. I tried asking for help so I could have a little free time to get back into the things I loved doing. My bf is the only one who does any chores but even then, I have to ask him 3-4 times before he finally takes out the garbage or cleans the litter boxes. 

I’m rambling and this is getting obnoxious even for me to write . 

Anyways if you’ve made it this far, I appreciate you reading my endless rant and pathetic cry for help . I know so many have it worse and I should be grateful for what I do have . It’s my own fault for not taking my life more seriously all these years and it’s my own fault for being in the situation I’m in. Maybe im just too caught up in my own existential angst to say fuck this and move forward , with or without the father of my son , and our soon to be daughter. Or maybe I’m just making excuses to throw my own personal pity party.",9,1736013446.0,Mommit,6,0.91,False

1htk08c,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1htk08c/the_laughing_one_part_3/,The Laughing One Part 3,"I don’t remember screaming, but I must have.

The clown was inches from my face, its hollow grin splitting its rusted cheeks. Up close, I could see the jagged edges of its metal teeth, the cracked seams where its paint was peeling away to reveal the corroded steel beneath.

And its eye—that single, empty eye—was staring through me, like it was looking straight into my soul.

The flashlight slipped from my hand and clattered to the ground, plunging everything into darkness.

That’s when I ran.

I don’t know how I found my way out of the carousel area. I was running blind, my legs carrying me forward through the maze of broken rides and crumbling pathways.

But the laughter followed me.

It echoed through the park, bouncing off the empty buildings and rusting attractions. Sometimes it sounded far away, faint and distorted. Other times, it was right behind me, so close I could feel the vibrations in my chest.

I tripped over something—an exposed pipe or a loose piece of wood—and hit the ground hard. Pain shot through my knee, but I barely felt it. My eyes were fixed on the ride ahead of me: the Funhouse.

Its crooked sign hung over the entrance, swaying in the cold wind. The painted letters were faded, but I could still make out the name: *LAUGHING ONE'S LAIR.*

The door was open.

It didn’t make sense, but I didn’t care. My only thought was to hide.

I scrambled inside and slammed the door behind me, pressing my back against it as I tried to catch my breath. The air inside was stale, thick with the smell of dust and mildew.

The Funhouse was just as I remembered it—or at least, that’s what I told myself. The mirrors were cracked and fogged over, the floor tilted at odd angles. The once-bright paint on the walls was peeling, revealing rotting wood beneath.

But something felt... off.

The air was colder here, and the silence was heavier, like the whole building was holding its breath.

And then I heard it.

The sound of footsteps, slow and deliberate, echoing through the Funhouse.

It wasn’t me.

I moved deeper into the Funhouse, trying to stay as quiet as possible. The hallways twisted and turned, leading me through a maze of warped mirrors and dead ends.

Every time I turned a corner, I saw my reflection staring back at me—only, it wasn’t quite right.

The faces in the mirrors were pale and distorted, their eyes too wide, their grins too sharp. Sometimes they moved when I didn’t, tilting their heads or twitching their fingers as if they were watching me.

But the footsteps kept coming.

Closer and closer.

I stumbled into a room with a single mirror in the center. It was cracked, the jagged lines splintering across its surface like a spiderweb.

For a moment, I thought I was alone.

And then I saw it.

The clown was standing in the mirror.

It wasn’t behind me—it was inside the glass, its twisted grin staring out at me.

“Your turn,” it whispered.

I screamed and spun around, expecting it to be in the room with me. But the room was empty.

When I looked back at the mirror, the clown was gone.

But my reflection wasn’t mine anymore.

The figure in the mirror was wearing my clothes, but its face wasn’t mine.

Its eyes were hollow and dark, its mouth stretched into a grotesque grin. It raised its hand and pressed it against the glass, its fingers splayed wide.

And then the glass began to crack.

The spiderweb of fractures spread outward, growing larger and larger until the mirror shattered completely.

But instead of falling to the floor, the shards hovered in the air, spinning like pieces of a broken puzzle.

And then they came together.

The clown stepped out of the mirror, its jagged body pieced together from the broken shards of glass. Its grin was sharper now, its edges gleaming in the faint light.

I backed away, my legs shaking, but the clown reached for me with one long, pointed hand.

The last thing I remember is its laugh.

It wasn’t the distorted, mechanical chuckle I’d heard before. This time, it was real. Deep and guttural, like it was coming from something alive.

And then everything went dark.

When I woke up, it was morning.

The sun was rising over the park, casting long shadows across the broken rides. The air was still, and the only sound was the distant chirping of birds.

I was lying on the ground near the entrance, my uniform torn and covered in dust.

The gates were closed, the chain and padlock back in place.

For a moment, I thought it had all been a dream. Just some weird, vivid nightmare brought on by nerves and too much coffee.

But then I heard it.

A faint laugh, echoing from somewhere deep within the park.

I don’t work at Halcyon Fun Park anymore.

I don’t talk about what happened that night, either—not to Carl, not to my friends, not to anyone. But sometimes, late at night, I hear that laugh again.

And when I close my eyes, I see its grin.

If you ever pass by Halcyon Fun Park, do yourself a favor.

Don’t stop.

Do you realize what you’ve done? I woke up today in a good mood. Birds were chirping, the sun was shining, my coffee was the perfect temperature, and I even got a free bagel from the shop because the barista said I had “good vibes.” Life was good. But then I saw your comment. It was like a black hole of unfunny sucked all the joy out of my day. You know how people say laughter is the best medicine? Well, your comment was the opposite—it was the disease. My brain cells didn’t just die; they packed their bags, left a “Dear John” letter, and fled the country. They’re probably somewhere in Argentina, trying to recover from the trauma.

I want you to know that I hate you. Not in a casual, “oh, they’re annoying” kind of way, but in a deep, primal, life-altering way. I hate you with the intensity of a thousand suns. I hate you the way Gordon Ramsay hates undercooked scallops. I hate you the way a cat hates cucumbers. I’ve been Googling ways to erase memories because I cannot live with the knowledge that your comment exists. I’m seriously considering contacting Elon Musk to see if he can create a neural implant that just deletes this specific event from my mind.

Do you even know how much damage you’ve done? I had plans today. PLANS. But now? Now, I’m sitting in the corner of my room, knees to my chest, rocking back and forth like I just survived the apocalypse. My plants are wilting. My dog won’t look me in the eye. My neighbor knocked on my door just to tell me my aura feels “off.” And he’s a Gemini. Do you know how unbalanced you have to be for a Gemini to notice?

Please, I’m begging you—never comment again. Ever. On anything. I don’t care if the situation is life or death. If the world is on fire, and your comment is the only thing that can save us all, I’ll personally choose extinction. In fact, I’ll push the button myself. Your unfunny comment has made me lose all faith in humanity. Honestly, I’m considering leaving society and living off the grid just to avoid the possibility of ever encountering your words again.

In conclusion: I hope you stub your toe on a table leg every day for the rest of your life. And not just any table leg—the sharp, IKEA kind that you think is safe until it destroys you. Good day. Or should I say bad day, because you’ve already ruined mine. Forever.",1,1736013041.0,copypasta,0,1.0,False

I was visiting Scotland in October and I was stopped in the street by a guy. Both in our 30s.

He was very nice & said I was so beautiful, we got on really well in those short 3 minutes, he asked for my number and I gave it to him.

He texted me almost straight away to say he wanted to meet me and go for some coffee, but I unfortunately had to fly back home to England.

I visited Scotland again on the 30th December. He said he absolutely wanted to meet me. I met him and we had an amazing time. He kissed me at the end, on the lips and on my hand and asked me multiple times if I wanted to see him again, I said yes definitely.

After the date, he texted me to say ""enjoy your show"" with a smiley face, because I had booked to see a theatre show while I was there.

I flew back the next morning.

I decided to text him today because I hadn’t heard from him since after the date evening. 

""

heres the update after I just texted him:

me = ""when do you think we can see each other again, I really liked you""

him = good morning, yes we will arrange something again, do you plan on coming to scotland again soon?

me = no plans

him = i can come over to you. possibly around march, got a few things here to do first

me = ok thats good id really like to see you if you come

him = yes absolutely, i will say i enjoyed the kiss we had at the end

me = so did i, but it was too short lol

I enjoy all my coffee with just a touch of milk, I drink with no sugars, and mostly dont like sweet drinks, so no added value with the vanilla or similar sweet drinks.

Something like a cortado,  not latte is what i drink.

I usually drink 3-4 coffee's per day, and it would be used for a family of 4, and they each drink around 3 per day too.

I enjoy an espresso too, but mostly strong coffee with a touch of milk... yeah that's it.

We (loved*) our floor plan when we first bought our house, however after moving in there was a significant issue that were not trying to fix. 

With no walk-in pantry, it's become incredibly difficult to store many things:
-Tupperware is a disaster in a pullout drawer 
-broom, mop etc all need to be stored in the foyer 
-all extra appliances need to be stored in the basement (coffee maker, stand mixer, air fryer etc etc). We use those semi regularly, but not enough to keep upstairs 
-all my partners baking supplies and bulk ingredients stays in the basement

By extension, we only use the dining room 4-5 times a year (birthday parties, Christmas, thanksgiving). When we need it it's fantastic, otherwise it just turns into a dumping ground. 

Our idea was to convert the dining room into a more functional kitchen extension. I've left my thoughts on the drawing, but what would you all think?

So, I'm a very active person. I have always studied different things, have been working since I was 15 (I'm about to turn 21), and get bored fast and want to move to a different enviroment.

I worked as an administrative in real state and in an attorneys firm. Then I worked for a NGO, as a facer in the street collecting donations.

Last year, I finally got a very good job, working from home as an interpreter (translator). Like a call center, I recieve calls from medical proffessionals who need help with their patients who don't speak their language. It can be inside the medical room or administrative tasks, even emergency calls.

Last year I was in a company with a fixed schedule, working a few pre-fixed hours, getting payed at the end of the month. That worked out so well! It was very stressful and consuming, but only a few hours in and then I had the rest of the day, and made so much more money that if I was working another job. The thing is, I made a trip to Europe for the summer and had to quit that job, was told to re-apply when I was back. When I got back, oof, it was so so hard. But then I recieved an offer from another company, same job but a higher pay, so I took it. The only problem, this company is free lance and I don't have a fixed schedule. I work when I like, the time I like, and that's so hard to keep up.

I'm an actress on top of all, I study many arts and have been working in many theater plays while working this other jobs. Since this company is free lance, I just can't bring myself to do it. I have spent multiple days, even weeks without working. I have got small jobs singing and performing in parties to mantain myself, but my income has decreased a lot - I was living on my own and had to move out due to problems with violent neighbors, so back at living with my mom, I don't have the same financial responsibilites that I had before, and this makes things even harder.

I have tried everything, working at different time of the day, setting alarms, working in sets of fewer hours during the day, nothing seems to work. I really need the money, but I just can't work this job anymore. I will wake up at 8, sit down at the computer (it's in a whole different room, I have tried that too) and just won't be able to work. I have booked another jobs, went in for a few days, just dropped becasue they're not as good as the one I have.

I get told that everytime, everyone just tells me they want my job, that it's so easy, that everyone gets tired after a while but it's such a good offer. I know, but it's just a demanding job. You cannot be passive, you have to be listening, translating, thinking ALL the time. No breaths. I can't even drink my coffee sometimes. Everyone says that I just have to do it, and that this is the best I'll get, best than any other job, but truly, I'm miserable and tired and anxious all day. My mental health is not the best at the moment and I think this job just contributes to that. This is the longest I've been working the same job, besides acting, one year and a half in translating.

Maybe I'm just whining and this is actually simple, but I wanted to vent a little and also share my problem.

What do you do when everyone tells you you already have the best job offer you'll get?

thank you for reading!

Happy new year!  As I'm looking for something IRL please kindly only reply/DM if you're in Europe thank you.

I seem to be one of the older folks around here, but thought I'd give this a try.  As the title says I'm 41 from the UK and would love to find a partner to enjoy life with.  In terms of my aceishness (not a word, but I'm running with it), I'm sex indifferent, but also consider myself kink positive, but I think that's a more private conversation for down the line.  On the flip side I can consider myself to be extremely romantic and love a good cuddle.

I work in tech (like every other Redditor it seems) and that keeps me very busy, but I find myself really lonely in my spare time, hence this post.  In terms of hobbies and interests I'm a huge lover of cinema, bit of a foodie, big reader (big interest in psychology) and I love my sci-fi, oh and coffee is my main vice.  I like to get out in nature especially if there's a cosy pub at the end of the hike.

What else?  I love animals especially dogs but don't have one at the moment unfortunately, I've dealt with my fair share of challenges in my life, but like to think that I've generally remained a positive person i.e. I've become a better more considered person despite said challenges.  

Feel free to say hello, while ultimately I'm looking for a partner I don't consider new friends a consolation prize.

We camped at the Pioneer site in Stephen C.

It got to freezing but everyone had extra layers on, extra sleeping pads, extra blankets, handwarmers aplenty, and we all got through it fine! The next morning I made hot coffee and breakfast for everyone, and then we packed up camp and hit the water again, except this time we went on a beautiful boat ride (2 boats) up to Minnie's Lake, where we picnicked at the shelter. It takes about 3 hours roundtrip.

The water level is still low, so be aware of stumps, knees, and logs right below the surface of the water. Both the kayaks and the boats got hung up on several. Be careful!",4,1736012192.0,OkefenokeeSwamp,0,1.0,False

Damned before the diagnosis, damned after it. ","I first asked for help when I was 18. My family doctor, a woman, told me very kindly to go to hell - because autism and ADHD were ""*male* conditions of the mind"". She thought any girl asking for a diagnosis just wanted drugs to improve their college grades. I left her office and never came back. This was in **2016**. I spent the next 8 years in shame, cramming the best I could and downing energy drinks like water. I've failed countless subjects.

Recently I finally realized I wasn't okay. This wasn't about turning in my assignments late anymore. I was leaving the gas/oven on by accident, getting locked out of my home every other day, forgetting about crucial appointments... so at the ripe age of 26, I contacted a psychiatrist. He said it was the most **blatant** case of ADHD he'd seen in a while. Got a prescription that same day. The meds didn't do miracles, needless to say.

**Fast forward**: my entire family is in denial because I've spent my entire life masking the restlessness I felt inside. It's an uphill battle, proving to them that I **wouldn't** have contacted a professional if I was alright. And my classmates... well, they aren't taking my condition seriously either. Because, uh, according to *online tests* for ADHD, I should be bouncing off the walls, getting sicker after drinking coffee and randomly pointing at squirrels.

Meanwhile, my male peers have had their meds since they were **teens**. No questions asked.

What did I do to deserve this? **How do I get my youth back?**

—

Operating under a capitalist system suggests a constant theme of scarcity and a fear of the future. It requires us to believe that there is not enough money, not enough opportunities, not enough resources for everyone and you better hustle today to get your piece of the pie tomorrow before someone else takes it. But of course, tomorrow never comes and neither does the pie. Every new day that begins with this mindset touches the deepest reaches of the soul. It can lead us to believe that there is not enough love, not enough patience, not enough compassion, not enough worthiness to go around. We have to earn our right to exist. It subtly deceives us with the subconscious lie that we might never meet our needs if we let even a single opportunity pass us by. In the pursuit of abundance, we live a life of scarcity.

But, if we can open our awareness to the present moment, there is so much abundance for us. A sunrise, a cup of coffee, a morning prayer, a breath filling our lungs. In this world, every smile is free and every moment can be joyful, even in less than ideal conditions. We do not need every wish fulfilled in order to find happiness. Pain hurts always, but this pain can be a compassionate teacher or an evil archnemesis. It is a matter of how you navigating your relationship with your troubles that determines which it will be. However, joy is not the solution to our pain. It is the result of it. With this open awareness of the present we can see that, not despite our struggles, but because of them, we are blessed with abundance.",0,1736011498.0,solarpunk,1,0.33,False

Was diagnosed with barrets esophagus off an EGD December 7
Must’ve had silent reflux my whole life and never known, my symptom started off as a stomach pain out of nowhere , and we thought it was a stress ulcer , I actually didn’t have “ reflux “ until I tried to stop PPIs one month later 

Well a month later I Read my lab report and I also have mild chronic gastritis 

I’ve been 80/20 with diet id say for the past 2 months, I eliminated caffeine and coffee entirely but this morning wanted to treat myself . Opted for an almond milk latte w one shot espresso one shot decaf . I had this after having a piece of sourdough bread w avocado and drank with a blueberry banana protein smoothie.  I feel like every meal has left me with some sort of gnawing pain in my stomach over the past month, or extreme bloating.  I swear I had 0 symptoms of any sort after this.  

I feel like the omeprazole as well as the gastritis slowed down my digestion and messed up my gut microbiome entirely , like being fuller after even small meals (in context, I used to be extremely athletic consuming 2k-2500 calories a day, I’m now down to maybe 1550-1750 a day).   I’m wondering if this little rush of caffeine sped it up  a little and maybe that had to do with some of my issue.

I know GERD and gastritis is a big puzzle with lots of pieces. It just was really nice to enjoy a coffee breakfast day with my husband for the first time in months and not feel like someone was stabbing me.

Now here's my next 20 reviews for your reading pleasure!

Nocturne Alchemy, sometimes known as ""NAVA"" from when they combined Nocturne Alchemy and VApothecary, is one of the most expensive houses, and I want to point out that you don't have to buy hundreds of dollars of full-sizes in order to explore their catalog and enjoy their artistry. I owe huge thanks to everyone who has sold or gifted me a decant, sample, or partial bottle. In fact, I have never actually ordered direct from the house myself! My *best* advice, if you want to explore NAVA, is to include [freebie sniffies](https://ajevies.myshopify.com/collections/extras/products/accessories?variant=26663602119) in your Ajevie order. When you check out, there's a text box in which you can ask for NAVAs specifically, and if they're available, they'll send you empty full-sizes! There's almost always still enough left to try, and it's been a great (and fantastically cost-effective) way for me to experience so many of NAVA's perfumes. You don't get to pick what you get, of course, but that in itself has been useful because it has allowed me to try a wide range of NAVA's notes, including some things I wouldn't have picked for myself (as you can see in a few of the reviews below). And then I can include these ""empty"" bottles as freebies when people order from my own destash - always great to spread the love!

Since folks keep saying it's helpful, I'll recopy my ""basics of the NAVA collections"" information. NAVA sells three categories of things:

* The [Permanent Collection](https://nocturnealchemy.com/collections/permanent-collection) are those scents they always keep around. PC scents are available in small 2-mls (which range in price from $11.50 to $12.50) in addition to the larger full-size bottles. (This is useful because if you're placing an Ajevie order during a NAVA pre-order window, you can get PCs as reasonably affordable add-ons - this is a great way to try some of the most beloved NAVA scents.) Unfortunately, the vanillas are *not* PCs...
* Which brings us to the second category: [Studio Limited](https://nocturnealchemy.com/collections/studio-limited) scents. SL scents are basically permanent as far as I can tell, but they are *not* offered in 2-ml small sizes. This is troublesome when you're a newbie NAVA fan trying to learn your way around this house but not spend too much money. Ajevie will occasionally decant SL scents, but only when NAVA adds new ones to a given SL collection. Otherwise, you have to buy full-sizes, or seek a friendly decanter. This is where to find the famous ""Vanilla Haven"" and ""Musk Haven"" collections.  has tried and reviewed a LOT of the musks (bless you!).  of Arae Decantery is working on getting a lot of the Studio Limited scents, especially the Musk Haven, in stock as decants, and already has quite a few available for order.
* The third category is the one that seems to turn a lot of people off from this house: the Limited Edition collections. NAVA is a house that runs on FOMO (fear of missing out). Seasonally throughout the year (Valentines, spring, summer, Halloween, holiday, and so on), NAVA releases a giant Limited Edition collection that is made up of two parts. First, the new scents that year; second, the ""Resurgence"" scents, which are (most of) the scents newly introduced in the previous year. Thus, a given LE perfume is likely to be around for exactly two years, no more: the first year it appears, and the next year when it's a Resurgence. You can find a fantastically useful archive of NAVA LEs [HERE](http://www.zombiiesque.net/) (I refer to that handy website all the time!). On the one hand, this is a decent model because you can theoretically sample in the first year (from Ajevie or Arae, or for much faster shipping since they *only* deal with NAVA, [Crypta Obscura](https://www.cryptaobscura.com/); or by seeking decants/samples from this community a few months later) and then buy more the next year if you love it. The NAVA Facebook group contains really useful review roundup posts if you're wondering what folks think of any of these LE scents. On the other hand, this sales model *absolutely* encourages a spirit of frantic buying to stave off FOMO. (""Oh no, this is its second year, the scent will be gone forever, I must buy more than I'll ever actually realistically use!"") The best advice I've heard is not to worry: NAVA recycles basic combinations a lot, so if you miss a particular perfume, chances are something similar will come around within a couple of years.

# Permanent Collection

**All Hallow's Eve**

* **Halloween 2025** \[Caramel Candy, Marshmallow Dust, Fresh McIntosh Apple Accord, Cinnamon Sticks, Tonka Bean, Honey Accord, Vanilla Buttercream Accord, Wood Embers Accord, Bastet’s Musk, Amber Incense, Tobacco Leaf, Oudh Essence, Bergamot Leaf, White Musk, Clove, Patchouli, and Smoked Sandalwood Accord\] - Oof, I really can't stand NA's buttercream! It's *suuuper* gourmand, all cloying sweetness and buttery richness…but alongside the buttercream and a sticky rum-like caramel, this scent also has some interesting smoke and spices.

**Egyptian Sweets, Coffee & Tea**

* **Apricot Muhallebi** \[Apricot seed, Apricot essence, Apricot Custard accord, Cake accord, Rice Milk, Bourbon Vanille, Orange Blossom, Sugar Cookie accord, Almond Macaroon accord, Buttercream accord, Vanilla Bean, Butter accord (vegan) Sweet Cream accord (vegan), Toasted Coconut accord, Cardamom absolute, Pink Sugar, White Musk and Crystalline Vanilla Absolute\] - It's quite gourmand - I definitely get both the cake (a slightly yeasty yellow cake) and the sugar cookies (similar to **Arcana Haul**, actually), along with buttery pie crust and yes, apricot, but less apricot than I had expected. This scent, in real life, would be a really spectacular accompaniment to a cup of tea; yet I don't really want to smell like dessert! It is, however, not super sugary, which is nice...but it's still very much baked goods.

**Royal Amber (forthcoming)**

* **Nefertem Amber** \[A blend of Egyptian, Bulgarian, Moroccan and Indian Rose Absolut, Essence and Accords, Sambac Jasmine, Ylang Ylang Essence, White Patchouli Essence, Atlas Cedarwood, White Musk Accord, Cardamom, Ginger, Amber Rose Accord, Amber Accord, Rock Rose Extract, Vanilla Absolute, Sandalwood, Vetiver, Nagarmotha, Labdanum Absolute, Bastet’s Musk, Rose Absolute infused with Oman Frankincense Resin, Grapefruit Zest, Orange Zest, Amyris and Tea Rose\] - Hello rose! This is exactly what I expected: a spiced rose-amber. The rose note is quite dry (not jammy) but not terribly green (geranium-ish), paired with a really woodsy amber that almost reads like pine resin. It dries down to a golden amber, fairly similar to **Horus Amber** as best I can recall.

**Temples, Cities & Necropolis**

* **Giza** \[Sandalwood Absolute, Sandalwood Musk Accord, eNVie saphir essence, White Amber Accord, Bastet’s Amber Absolute, Resin of Royal Sweet Frankincense, and Languid Amber\] - A golden sandalwood tinged with balsamic Saphir amber and strong presence of soft white amber. It's more robust than **RS Musk**, for sure (see below), but still a very light sort of sandalwood scent - not a creamy white sandalwood but not a dark or super woodsy sandalwood either. It feels like the first days of fall when the air is just starting to cool and the leaves just beginning to turn yellow. It dries down to a Saphir-tinted white amber, luminous and cool and beeswaxy-sweet. I *really* like this one, though I haven't worn it since the weather got cool.

# Studio Limited

**Former Studio Limited Original?? I honestly have no idea when they released this as a single-note**

* **Bastet's Ice Cream** \[Vanilla Crystalline Cream, Butter accord, Caramel Accord, French Vanilla Bean Absolute, Vanilla Milk accord, Vanilla Orchid, Crystalline Absolute and Vanilla Sugar\] - For the longest time, I steered clear of blends with BIC in it, worried that it would be too literally butter or too gourmand, but then I took a chance on **Ice Cream & Summer Rose** (and *loved* it), and since then I have loved BIC as a note provided it's paired with some non-gourmand notes to tone it down. It was a real delight to get a chance to try BIC by itself to see what it's like all alone. And--oh my goodness, it's practically a dupe of my beloved **Lorelei Vanille Blanche**! Or should I say, **Vanille Blanche** is a dupe of *this*: a rich, buttery, honeyed golden vanilla, luscious and gorgeous.

**Musk Haven**

* **Bastet's Musk** \[A magnetic skin musk made from a soft white floral blend of Tuberose, Mallow, Angelica, Musk Flower, and White Lily balanced exquisitely through Enfleurage oil extraction methods\] - I've never tried it by itself before, but it's the base of at least half (and probably more like 2/3) of the scents I love best from NA. **Bastet's Musk** is a soft, diffuse, velvety floral-sweetness, a little powdery, and very dainty. By itself it's pretty much the perfect feminine my-skin-but-better scent, and I suspect it will be really lovely for layering with anything that could use this sort of soft, silky base.

# Limited Collection

**Royal Sandalwood Collection (Oct 2024)**

* **RS Caramelized** \[Royal Caramel and Buttery Vanilla blend: Golden Caramel essence, Madagascar Vanilla Bean absolute, Studio Limited Crystalline Vanilla Absolute, a drizzle of melted Bastet’s Ice Cream accord, Caramelized Australian Sandalwood, Santalum Absolute aged in a Bourbon and Oakwood barrel and a drizzle of Halloween Caramel accord\] - It's pretty much what it says on the tin: rich and luscious caramel on a woody sandalwood base that compliments it beautifully. The caramel has a depth and complexity to it that actually makes it feel like it represents both sticky, drippy caramel and crisp, dark toffee. On the whole, it's fairly gourmand, the sandalwood definitely the background note to the caramel(s), but it's also less artificially sweet than I'd been worried it could be.
* **RS Musk** \[Egyptian Musk, Sweet Musk, Bastet’s Musk, Snow Musk Accord, Himalayan Cedarwood, Vanilla Fleck, Amyris, Myrrh, Balsam of Peru, Fir Balsam, Sandalwood Absolute, Australian Sandalwood, Indian Sandalwood Absolute aged in a Bourbon and Oakwood barrel, and Irish Moss\] - It's a gorgeous light and airy musk with a puff of equally airy sandalwood floating behind it. It's ethereal, inconsequential, and utterly lovely. It's a perfect workplace scent, inoffensive and pretty, and less faint on my skin than I expected when sniffing it in the vial. Compared to **Sandalwood Musk**, this new **RS Musk** is much more airy and diaphanous, and with a much a higher ratio of musk to sandalwood. As for that musk, it's primarily Bastet's Musk, all velvety petals. The Egyptian musk is noticeable but not too strong (thankfully - I don't always love Egyptian musk), and the reference to ""snow musk"" also feels really accurate; there's something slightly cool and wintery about it. A bit of slightly aquatic moss and cedarwood start to poke their heads out in the drydown, making the overall effect less floral than the Bastet's Musk-heavy opening. **RS Musk** and **Sandalwood Musk** are definitely different, and for lovers of soft airy sandalwood (like me!) I think it's well worth having both

**Thoth's Archive Mid-Summer 2024**

* **Eternal Ankh Mangue** (Mango) \[Mango Essence Accord, Mango Skin, Raspberry Essence, Bastet’s Musk, Bastet’s Ice Cream Accord, Vanilla Bean, Vanilla Crème, White Amber light, Powdered and reconstructed oil of Egyptian Vanilla Husk, and Vanilla fleck\] - Mango is, of course, much more tropical than peach, but this reminds me of nothing so much as those sugared peach gummy rings! It's very fruity and very candied - my husband says it smells like yellow Starbursts. Despite the artificial sweetness, there's also something really light and summery and refreshing about this (and throw and longevity are both high), but for NA mango I'm going to stick to my beloved **Koala Joey** \[Australian Sandalwood, Mango Skin, Crystalline, Bastet’s Ice Cream essence, Tonka Bean, Indian Sandalwood, Hawaiian Sandalwood\].

**Thoth's Archive Spring 2024**

* **Ginger Bee** \[Orange Blossom Honey accord, White Ginger essence, Ginger essential oil, Bastet’s Amber absolute, Moonstone Absolute, and Ginger Rhizomes\] - I really don't like NA's honey, so none of the Bees have ever worked for me, but I got this as a sniffie and tried it anyway so I could report back. Like all the Bees, it's built on a base of that thick, cloying, but not super sweet (and slightly orangey) orange blossom honey note. Here the orange is accentuated by a genuinely fabulous spicy ginger. This feels very holiday to me. Or, a cup of tea that tastes like this smells would probably be brilliant for soothing the throat in a wintertime cold.

**Holiday 2023**

* **Breathe** \[Pine and Balsam Essential Oils, Fir extraction, Green Cardamom, Green Pepper, White Musk, Bastet’s Musk absolute, Labdanum, and eNVie saphir\] - Peaceful musky evergreens, with a blankety weight to the musks and a marshmallowy sweetness. The Bastet's Musk is quite prominent here. I've never tried Bastet's Musk paired with tree notes before; I usually love it with florals, but I'm not so sure its sweetness entirely suits the evergreens. Husband sniffed my wrist and said ""ooh, you smell like a Christmas tree!"" While I've been seeking an ethereal tree-sandalwood scent, I'm a bit relieved not to need to FS this one (this and **Exhale** were the ones that caught my eye, and **Exhale** is a bigger success for me).
* **Exhale** \[Jasmine extrait, French Lavender Essential Oil, Crimson absolute (Studio Limited Originals), Bastet’s Amber absolute, eNVie saphir, and Jasmine Musk\] - NA's typically herbal, astringent lavender is softened beautifully by a velvety jasmine, the same kind of soft, petally, totally non-indolic jasmine as in **Jasmine Musk** and **Eternal Ankh Purple**. It's backed by fruity red Crimson musk and a touch of golden amber, not recognizably Saphir, but the same sort of brilliantly sunny amber background as in **Masquerade RA**. I think this will be a lovely yoga perfume; it's peaceful and meditative and very, very pretty. I was a little unsure of this one (I snagged someone's Ajevie leftovers bottle from their destash) but I am ultimately very glad I sprang for it! I would say this is first and foremost a lavender perfume, and it's the first really herbal lavender scent that I have loved this much (I tend to prefer more floral lavender notes).
* **Crystalline #14** \[Crystalline Absolute, Cake accord, Vanilla Bean, Vanilla infused Sugar Cane accord, Ice Cream accord, English Lemon Curd, Crème Brûlée accord, Bastet’s Musk absolute, and Green Cardamom absolute\] - It's extremely lemon in the vial, with a background of fluffy white cake, so the vial sniff is very ""lemon chiffon cake,"" but on my skin the order of prominence is reversed, and I'm getting more cake - a toasty, almost nutty cake, with a hint of lemon frosting. As a lemon cake perfume, this isn't terribly original, but it is beautifully executed, and not cloyingly sweet.

**Summer 2023**

* **Ice Cream & Summer Cardamom & Butter Pecan** \[Summer Cardamom essential oil, Caramelized Pralines, Butter Toasted Pecans, Bastet’s Ice Cream blend (Vanilla Crystalline Cream, Butter accord, Caramel Accord, French Vanilla Bean Absolute, Vanilla Milk accord, Vanilla Orchid, Crystalline Absolute and Vanilla Sugar), and Vanilla Buttercream\] - I had originally passed this up (twice!) thinking it would be much too gourmand for me. However, the surprising success of several of the other Summer Ice Creams, and a bunch of reviews that praised the cardamom in this, convinced me to pick this up when I saw it in a destash. However...I should have gone with my gut instinct here. It's genuinely spectacular, such a triumph of a gourmand, but it is indeed *super* gourmand, and even the intense burst of cardamom (swoon) can't save it for me. I'm coming to realize that the thick, sweet, desserty vanilla of Bastet's Ice Cream *can* work for me, as long as it's paired with thoroughly non-gourmand elements. Here, though, the buttery pecans and extra buttercream make it cloying and very, very sweet; much too sweet for me. I admire the artistry here, it is genuinely delicious-smelling (and I would love to eat a dessert that smells like this! I just don't want to smell like this!) so I'll pass it along to someone who will love it more.

**Valentine 2023**

* **Crystalline #5** \[Our chypre of Crystalline; Italian Bergamot, Grapefruit zest, Mandarin zest, White Jasmine petal, White Rose petal, Nevada Patchouli essence, Tree Moss accord, Cistus Labdanum, Sandalwood, Italian Olive Musk accord, Chrysanthemum essence, Helichrysum essence, Crystalline (Studio Limited originals) and Bastet’s Musk absolute\] - It's pretty! Light, airy, juicy, sort of nondescript-ly fruity and floral. If I had to guess, not looking at the notes, I'd probably guess zingy raspberry, some sort of citrus, rose, and mayyybe a touch of carnation. The Crystalline here feels floatier than ever. It's a lovely scent - probably perfect in late spring - but also somewhat forgettable. It fills much the same role as the similarly fruity-floral **Crystalline #13** \[Crystalline Absolute, Moonflower Accord, Pear skin, Agave Nectar, Amber, Poppy accord, Italian Lemon, Bastet’s Musk Absolute, Allspice, eNVie saphir Absolute, Lotus Blossom, Rose Petal, Jasmine essence, White Patchouli, and French Vanilla Bean\]

**Valentine 2019**

* **Candied Sandalwood** (now called **Candied Santalum**) \[Candied Accord \[Victorian-style Sugar-Candied perfumes infused with Lime Zest, aged Orange slices, Raspberry Essence, Pear Essence, Sugar Accord, Lemon Zest, Vanilla Extract, Pink Sugar, Bourbon Vanille Absolute, Crystalline Absolute and Vanilla Bean\] with Santalum Sandalwood Absolute\] - This is SO FUN and strangely intoxicating! It's exactly what it says in the bottle: a slightly fizzy lemon-lime (Sprite!) paired with luscious sandalwood. It's cheeky and absolutely wonderful, and beautifully long-lasting too. I can see it working in dramatically different seasons. The day I tried it, I was wearing a super Halloween-y mix of orange dress with white and black striped shirt and tights, and its boldness is a perfect accent, but the inherent cheerfulness of this Candied accord would also work well for spring and summer too. \[Note: I can tell my decant is from the 2019 release (or the 2020 Resurgence), rather than from the 2023 Candied Thoth's Archive, because it's labeled ""Candied Sandalwood"" and not ""Candied Santalum""\]

**Vintage (\~2010?)**

* **Thoth Moon: Lapis** \[Created by Thoth under the last Blue moon this is the essence of blue over the city of San Francisco; writing my words from Thoth within me. I blend with the other NAlchemists under the night skyline of this city so that we can capture so many things pure and within reason looked at from a romantic perspective in that we follow the Ancient alchemists from so long ago by blending this way. There are usually scent-less candles nearby to intensify the feeling but under this blue moon I felt overwhelmed by the sheer beauty it made me feel inside. I wanted Star Anise to spark as if the moon was directly overhead and then amyris balsam and sandalwood and redwood to dream into the senses and parade in the mind the meaning of the color blue in my forest of stars. These are the words that came to my mind. ""All I have, when I cannot convey to you what cannot be said, is simply a kiss. My eyes are closed underneath this blue moon and I sit by the bay waiting for you to come. Underneath this blue moon my sight betrays me and I look for you where only my soul can search. My heart is on the ground but my love for you is in the stars waiting to shine for you. I will wait for you by the bay and listen to the waves come and go. I will wait forever until you find your way back to me. I will hold onto the moon until she lets me go...until my lips can kiss yours.""\] - Oh *noooo*! In the vial, it smells woody and purpley and hazy, with some dry star anise, but it's quite gentle. On my skin, though, the anise amps until it's shouting, a licorice so strong it becomes almost rubbery. The soft redwood underneath is gorgeous, but completely overpowered.

**Vintage (2009)**

* **Blue Anti-Venom** \[Blue Chamomile, Blue Egyptian Tagetes, Blue Vanilla, Egyptian Amber Musk, Spun Egyptian Skorpian Sugar, Egyptian Black Vanilla, Red Ginger and Cream of Vanilla\] - Beautiful blue chamomile, closer to **Om Na Balance** than **Alchemist Chamomile** because of its quite herbal nature, paired with crystallized sugar and a slight bite of freshly-grated ginger. It's less plush and blankety than **Alchemist Chamomile** because it's sugar rather than Moonstone vanilla, but sweeter than the more herbal-grassy **Om Na Balance** with its yellow tone and base of sandalwood. A bedtime scent for sure! I did end up destashing this one because I realized I'd always reach for the other two chamomile scents over it, though. I feel so, so grateful to have gotten to try this, because only 5 bottles were ever made! My bottle came with a little tag that said it was #3.

**Vintage (2008)**

* **Eternal Ankh Vintage** **(2008)** (yes that's the full name) \[White Amber, Powdered and reconstructed oil of Egyptian Vanilla Husk, Vanilla fleck, African White Vanilla and the scent of soft Egyptian Sands. Aged for two years in a raw cedar barrel, accented with teak and oak for a distinct blend of Vintage Eternal Life\] - It's that familiar, lovely sandy, white-ambery **Eternal Ankh** with dry wood undertones, an incredibly pleasing combination - but puzzlingly right on application I'm also getting slight whiffs of roasted peanuts, what's that all about?? As it dries, the wood notes get a little more smoky, which is cool (and happily the peanuts are all gone). This could easily be called something like ""Eternal Ankh: Wood Elf"".

**Vintage (I have no idea of the date! This one seems to have** ***no*** **internet presence at all)**

* **Ana Ohebak** \[Santalum White (Egyptian White Sandalwood), Aged Crimson (Red Egyptian Musk), Skin Musk, a drop of White Tunisian Jasmine, Black Peppercorn Essential Oil and aged Nepalese Amber Resin Perfume\] - Beautiful Santalum White (the creamy white sandalwood of my dreams) paired with the fruity red musk of Crimson (I can stand Crimson in small amounts; I can't handle any Kashmir in anything). Between the red musk, skin musk, and peppercorn, there's a little bit of b.o. to this when wet, but it dries down to that intoxicating Santalum White plus skin musk, and it's exceptionally velvety.

(It's in the 70's F where I live.) 

I was sitting in the living room having my coffee when my husband came to the living room and pointed out a black cat walking along our fence line. My immediate reaction was joyful, happy; I love cats so I took a picture and a video. 

Then, I got up to refill my coffee cup and in the kitchen was a light blue balloon, barely floating just above the floor. Neither of us have any idea where this came from. Yes, it very likely came in through the back door, but I have no idea how this struggling, limping balloon could have had the velocity to make it *over* our back fence, into the yard, through the patio door threshold and over to the kitchen. 

I have a tendency to think about/dream about certain things, and they happen. Ex - I had a very vivid dream that my brother passed away, and a month later, he did. 

When trying to connect these two very strong symbolic messages, I recall that this morning I happened to be thinking about the fact that my dad is turning 70 this year, and I won't have much time with him. I also have a friend going through a miscarriage right now. Additionally, my husband and I will soon be trying to conceive our own child.  

I don't know what this black cat and light blue balloon could mean, but they are both such odd, unique signs that I know in my bones this was some kind of message. I just wish I knew what. ",1,1736011386.0,Mediums,0,1.0,False

I'm turning 35 next week, and my parents will be away on holiday for my birthday. No problems there at all. 

My mom suggested a couple of weeks ago that we get a takeaway at their house to celebrate my birthday before they go. I agreed. It wasn't necessary but sounded good to me. It was nice of them to think about.

So today I'm supposed to be heading to their house for this takeaway. They've already had my daughter at their's for the afternoon so I can get stuff done (single parent) which is nice of them and she enjoys it. 

I got a message from my mom about an hour ago asking if I want to meet them at the pub and get takeaway on their way home. This is reasonable on the surface but my problem is they literally just want to meet up with their friends to drink. I'm t-total and have been for years so I'm being invited to come and watch my parents drink with their friends for my supposed birthday celebration. It means we wouldn't be eating until about 8:30 which is late for my daughter and means it'll just be eat and then leave so she can go to bed. That's just...food after my parents go to the pub and I'm just there too? It's not a 'birthday celebration' whatsoever and just not my idea of fun at all. Under 0 circumstances would I make a plan with them that involved sitting bored in a pub watching people drink.

It reminds me of childhood birthdays where I'd be having fun and then suddenly my parents friends would appear for the party and it would become just them sat around drinking coffee and chatting with each other for hours, like any other day. I'm an only child so it made my younger birthdays (which were mainly family) really dull. This is why I might be overreacting. Like I'm seeing this as a pattern from my childhood rather than just being an adult and going with the flow.

I also don't love taking my 8 year old to watch adults drink, but it's an accepted part of uk culture so I tend to be relaxed about it. I'll also be trying to keep her entertained because the conversation will be boring as hell and she'll be getting hungry. Being taken to the pub to sit hungry waiting until we can leave and get the food is another less than fond memory from my own childhood so I could be overreacting with the feeling that they're now 'inflicting' it on my child. 

They're actually very good grandparents though I promise.

If they didn't already have my daughter at their house today, I'd say just let me know when you're home and we'll come for some food. Or just cancel plans with them and order food myself at home for me and my daughter. 

But she's already there at their house so any changes would mean an awkward ""no and I'm on my way to fetch my daughter right now"" kind of scenario, which I don't want. If I say no I don't want to to to the pub first it'll be awkward because my dad's very rigid about getting what he's decided on. He won't say anything but the atmosphere and mood will be weird. He's only ever like that with me though. 

I seem to be stuck accepting a scenario that I would otherwise avoid and calling it my birthday party, which is annoying. I'd be quite happy with not celebrating my birthday. Like I said, I'm 35, it's fine. Instead I'm going to be stuck sitting bored with my own daughter watching my parents drink with their friends and they'll be thinking that because there's food after, that they've treated me for my birthday.

After a year of seeing doctor after doctor I have recently been diagnosed with a secondary disease linked to toxin exposure. No heavy metals, but I did test for mycotoxins. Here’s what my tests revealed:

* **Trichothecene**: Extremely high levels

* **Gliotoxin derivative**: Moderate level

* **Zearalenone**: Moderate level

Over the past year, my health has been deteriorating so I have made sure to eliminate anything bad, and keep a very strict diet including:

* No candles, plastics, or aluminum in my home.

* Switched all beauty/ bathing/ skincare products to natural and fluoride-free toothpaste.

* Installed reverse osmosis for water.

* Mainly eat fresh, organic fruit and vegetables (no gluten, nuts). 1 x week meat/ seafood.

* Switched coffee to organic Whole Foods brand.

Despite all this, I continue to struggle. I live in a new building, so when I suspected mold, I hired a company to investigate. Unfortunately, they didn’t take me seriously. They claimed mold is unlikely in new construction, and I feel like they might’ve just taken my money and not done what I asked. They only did air sampling (no in-depth inspection).

I felt fine before moving in. Within 60 days of living here, I started getting sick, to the point where I couldn't get through a full day or leave the house for over 2 months. Recently with the weather a little chillier (I'm in Florida) I have opened the windows and my symptoms lessen. Something in this building is 100% triggering me.

The building management won’t help or even consider that there’s an issue, and I’m stuck in a lease. I don’t even know where to begin. I’m desperate to figure it out and I need to correct the problem:

1. What’s causing these elevated mycotoxin levels.

1. How I can eliminate it (or mitigate exposure while stuck in the lease).

1. How to support my health and start recovering.

Has anyone been through this? Any advice or recommendations—whether for testing, identifying hidden sources, or treatment—would mean the world to me. I’m completely overwhelmed and unsure where to turn next

1htj9t2,https://www.reddit.com/r/InsightVault/comments/1htj9t2/facts_about_your_heart/,Facts About Your Heart,"**Amazing Facts About Your Heart You Probably Didn’t Know**

The heart isn’t just a hardworking pump—it’s a marvel of nature, tied to your emotions, your health, and even your future. Here’s why your ticker deserves more credit:

1. **Your Heart Can Sense the Future** (Sort of)
No, it won’t predict winning lottery numbers, but your heart has a spooky way of anticipating things. In studies, people’s heart rates increased up to 10 seconds before seeing an exciting or disturbing image—before they even knew what was coming. Your body knows when something thrilling (or unsettling) is on its way.


2. **Happiness Is Literally Good for Your Heart**
Turns out, happiness isn’t just about good vibes. A strong sense of emotional vitality can significantly reduce your risk of heart disease. So smile more—it might save your life.


3. **Heart Stats That Will Blow Your Mind**
Your heart beats 100,000 times a day—that’s about 3 billion beats in a lifetime.
An adult heart beats 60–80 times per minute, but newborns are racing at 70–190 BPM.
It pumps a whopping 6 quarts (5.7 liters) of blood throughout your body every single day.


4. **Laugh Your Way to a Healthy Heart**
Laughing isn’t just fun—it’s functional! It increases your heart rate and gets oxygen-rich blood flowing, improving circulation and reducing the risk of heart disease. So yes, your favorite sitcom might just be saving your life.


5. **Eat Your Way to a Healthier Heart**
Here’s a grocery list that your heart will thank you for:
- Berries (blueberries, strawberries, raspberries): Packed with heart-healthy nutrients and fiber.
- Seeds: Flaxseeds are loaded with omega-3s and fiber.
- Coffee: 1–2 cups a day could help reduce heart failure risk.
- Dark Chocolate: The flavanols in cocoa are linked to lower blood pressure and reduced heart disease risk.
- Lemons: High in vitamin C and fiber, they support heart health.
- Honey: Rich in antioxidants that may help lower heart disease risk.
- Tomatoes: Lycopene helps reduce “bad” cholesterol and blood pressure.
- Red Wine (in moderation): Antioxidants may help prevent artery damage.


6. **Yes, You Can Have a Broken Heart—Literally**
Heartbreak isn’t just emotional; it’s physical too. Broken Heart Syndrome (aka stress cardiomyopathy) mimics heart attack symptoms and is caused by sudden emotional or physical stress. Women are more likely to experience it, and the pain is very real.


7. **Heart Disease**: The Silent Killer of Women
Heart disease is the leading cause of death for women, but only 56% of women know this. Prevention is in your hands:
- Eat heart-healthy foods.
- Exercise regularly.
- Keep blood pressure, blood sugar, and 
- cholesterol in check.
- Quit smoking if you haven’t already.


8. **Breakups Can Make You Stronger**
Heartbreak hurts, but it doesn’t have to break you. With optimism and healthy coping, you can come out the other side stronger and more resilient.


The heart does it all—keeps you alive, responds to your emotions, and powers every moment of your life. Show it some love by taking care of it! ❤️

I am not trying to date this person just have a good working relationship/friendship common to the environment.

So she always seems happy when I’m around and easy to talk to. However she will decline offers to head out to lunch or go to work events. Yet if I don’t offer I will get “what about me” style comments. Like if I walk in with a drink from a place she may say hey I would have wanted one. Last time I said “well I offered before and you always said no so I stopped asking.” Then I sort of felt like a jerk as I think maybe I misread.

She has also made lunch plans or work day coffee like plans then would bail at the last moment without real explanation. After she did it a couple times in a row I just stopped agreeing to that type of stuff to avoid the cancelation. I wanted to ask why the last minute bailout but I didn’t want to make an issue of it.

So I stopped asking this person to head out to places (groups or just us). I stopped texting, which were infrequent work related comments mostly, and just stuck to passing by water cooler type of interactions. 

So now she’s asked me to lunch or coffee which I have gone along with. She hasn’t bailed lol. I would consider myself a dumb guy when reading women, but the back and forth confuses me to the point where I do not want to intrude on this persons time nor do I want to give them a cold shoulder.

How do I ask what someone’s thinking without seeming like I’m coming on to them? Which again I’m not trying for a work romance here. I guess I only care because our office space is one of close working. I tuned her out as the type that just saw work as work with no friendships already but yet she re-engages. 

It occurred to me that maybe she is interested in me and doesn’t want to mess up the work space by making me feel awkward.

Ten years ago I was a complete nobody, a IT guy in a dead end job. Had almost no friends, and couldn't get laid if my life depended on it. But right now? I'm sitting in a penthouse suite in Dubai, sipping thousand-edollar whiskey while my Interface scans every person in my field of vision. The sun is setting over the Persian Gulf, painting the sky in shades of orange and purple that my augmented vision could break down into exact wavelengths of light. Yesterday, I was in Prague, hunting something with too many eyes and teeth that had torn its way through the fabric of reality. Tomorrow or next week? Could be anywhere. Tokyo, Rio, New York. All I have to do is step into a teleporter – an actual honest-to-god teleporter – and I'm there.

Oh yeah, you probably raised an eyebrow at the terms “Interface”, “Augmentations”, or “Teleporters”.

No way those exists on 21st-century Earth. Hah, think again.

The people I work for – hell, I’m not even sure if they are actually *people* – call me a ""Sentinel"", and they are well past the current worlds technological level. I don’t want to say their name, but they are an organization you’ve never heard of. I’ll just call them my Benefactors… and they got technology that’s so advanced it might as well be goddamn magic.

Think the Men in Black movies, but instead of sending Will Smith to crack jokes and say “WooooOOOooo” to alien refugees and cute talking pugs… my Benefactors send *me* to deal with nine-dimensional Eldritch Abominations and the occasional Alternate Universe Hitler that found a way into our timeline. And yes, I’ve killed a few Hitlers… and let me tell you, you haven’t lived until an alternate universe Hitler tries to strangle you with his ten-foot prehensile dick that fires a napalm like substance. Yeah, *that* was fun.

They call these things “Intruders”. That’s the catch-all term they use for any being from outside our universe that shouldn’t be here. There are many types of Intruders, all with different long, fancy-sounding technical designations. But I’ve come up with my own slang for each type, words like “Glitchers”, “Tanglers”, “Warpers”, etc. But not all of them are monstrous tentacle creatures: sometimes we get humans from alternate realities, like the Hitlers I mentioned earlier. If an Intruder is a human, most of the time it's some scientists who's teleportation or wormhole experiment went wrong and they got sucked into our Universe. When it comes to these unlucky idiots, my Benefactors can apparently send them back to their reality... so long as they surrender and coming willingly. I once ran into an alternate universe OJ Simpson, who in his universe became a brilliant scientist instead of a football star. You should have seen the look on his face when I told him what our OJ Simpson ended up doing.

Oh yeah, so about my capabilities… I am a legitimate superhuman. Hell, I might be straight-up *trans*human. I don’t say that to brag or boast, I say it as fact. My Benefactors augmented me with the type of enhancements you see only in sci-fi media: enhanced muscle density, reinforced skeletal structure, accelerated healing. I can overturn pickup truck with ease, and can heal damn near any wound within six-hour. Hell, actually I can heal much faster — Wolverine-style — if I “overclock” my augmentation, but that will leave some nasty scars. Oh yeah, when I say “nasty scars” I mean four-dimensional scars that fuck with your brain when you look at them too long.

I also got an energy shield aug, works kinda like the ones in *Dune*. Stops fast-moving objects like bullets and the like, protects against explosions, etc. The heavy-hitting Intruders can punch it so hard it breaks, however, so I still gotta stay on my toes.

Also, my entire nervous system has been augmented. My reflexes don't just bypass conscious thought – they bypass physical limitations. The other day, I caught a fly between my thumb and forefinger without looking. Not because I'm that fast, but because the Interface predicted its flight path and my augmented neurons fired the necessary muscles about half a second before I even registered the fly was there. Sometimes I'll be in the middle of a fight, and my body will pull off these incredible acrobatic moves that I'm pretty sure violate several laws of physics. The Interface tells me it's just optimal kinetic chain exploitation, but I think that's just technobabble for ""we bent reality just a little.""

As you might have guessed, having an augmented nervous system means I’m a monster with firearms. Combined with my Interface’s targeting and probability calculating capabilities, I can get headshots all day. I once shot the head off a mosquito flying past me while I was hungover. Hell, I don’t even remember aiming my gun, my nervous system just did it for me as soon as the little bugger – pardon the pun – came into range.

Speaking of firearms, my standard issue sidearm is equally nuts. It’s a pistol they simply call the ""Vindicator” that looks vaguely like the Auto-9 from *Robocop,* and it can change the actual properties of it’s rounds on the fly. It’s integrated with my Interface, so if I want explosive rounds? I *think* it and suddenly all of the rounds in the magazine become explosive. Frangible rounds that fuck-up organic material but just harmlessly desintegrate when hitting anything else? It can do that. Taser-like stun rounds? It’ll do that. This thing can change the properties of the cartridges on the fly with just a thought. It also has a Hyper-Velocity mode, where it utilizes micro-teleporters in the barrel to “borrow” kinetic energy from slightly ahead in time and place it behind the bullet right before impact. What this means rounds never lose speed because the gun keeps stealing muzzle velocity from a few fractions of a second in the future. The result? Bullet that hit like they're just been fired from a railgun, which comes in handy when you have to put down a “High-caloric Density Non-Euclid Homunculus” (aka what I call a “Fatty”).

My augs don't stop there, though. The stuff I just mentioned? Those are the *least impressive* ones. I got some stuff that my Benefactors call “Paradox-tier” augmentations… these are the ones I have to use sparingly… *because they freaking break reality*.

I have one that lets me manipulate gravity. I can run across walls and ceilings like goddamn Neo, I can make objects weightless so they just float around like they’re in space. One time I used this ability “swim around” the penthouse I was staying in, catching skittles in my mouth like a game of zero-g Hungry Hungry Hippos. My Benefactors chewed me the fuck out, because I was causing gravity fluctuations in the area. Apparently, a few cars and cat just lifted off the ground and floated to the sky like in Harry Potter. Woops. They told me this was my *one* warning to never use Paradox-tier augs outside of missions, and even then, only if no other tactical options were suitable. They never actually stated the consequences if I did it again, but they way they worded it “one warning” sent chills down my spine.

I got another one that actually slows fucking time itself. No, I don’t mean The Flash-style superspeed, I mean it actually slows down time in an area of my choosing… sorta like that Stasis Module from the *Dead Space* games, but instead of use affecting one enemy, it affects everything in a large radius… except myself. Very useful for those super-fast Intruders, “Sprinters”. But again, it’s a Paradox-tier aug, so using it too much fuckshe space-time continuum or something.

Finally, my last Paradox-tier aug is a short range teleporter. I was told it works differently from the big teleporters I use to travel around the planet... less stable, according to my Benefactors. But anyways it let's me hop from one place to another like that guy from X-Men. It’s my go-to solution for getting out of a tight spot, but it comes with a catch. Using it too much can cause “version bleeding"" as my Benefactors call it – which in layman's terms means that the memories of alternate versions of myself start blending together with my own. Used it twice in quick succession I spent the next two hours having a heated argument with my reflection in the bathroom mirror because it didn’t like the tie I put on earlier...except I never wore a tie that day. The memory of this other alternate me made me forget which timeline I was actually on. My Administrator had to show up and sedate me with a tranquilizer dart and put me on bedrest for a week to let my brain sort out which memories were mine and which weren't.

Last but definitely not least is an aug I’ve mentioned a few times already — The Interface. It’s actually the first one they install, the one that acts as the basis for all the others. You probably already assumed it’s some kind of crazy-near-magical Heads Up Display… but it's not like the augmented reality displays you see in sci-fi movies. There's no floating screens or obvious overlays. The Interface is… integrated. Seamless. Like having a second consciousness running parallel to your own, feeding you information so naturally it feels like you're remembering things you never learned.

Imagine you're looking at a coffee cup. Your brain automatically knows it's a coffee cup because you've seen thousands of them. You don't think about recognizing it – you just know. That's how the Interface works, except it's doing that with everything, all the time, on levels you never knew existed. I look at a coffee cup, and I instantly know its temperature, chemical composition, potential use as a weapon, structural weak points, and whether it's been tampered with. Not as data points or readouts, but as pure, intuitive knowledge.

The really weird part? It works on dimensions and spaces that human brains aren't supposed to process. When I encounter one of those things – the ones that slip through from other realities – I can actually see all of it. Every impossible angle, every reality-breaking geometry. The Interface translates it into something my consciousness can handle without breaking. It's like… you know how your brain fills in your visual blind spot so you never notice it's there? The Interface does that with reality itself, letting me perceive things that should drive me insane.

Then there's the cognitive enhancements the Interface enables. My pattern recognition is off the charts. I can process information faster than any computer – not because I'm smarter, but because the Interface is running parallel processing on my thoughts. It's like having a thousand little Mes all thinking about different aspects of a problem simultaneously. When I speak to someone, I'm not just hearing their words – I'm analyzing their micro-expressions, vocal patterns, physiological responses, and about fifty other markers I didn't even know existed before. The Interface synthesizes all of this into what it calls ""predictive behavioral modeling"", but what it really means is that I can read people like they're children's books… despite the fact I was always awkward and not terribly great in social situations.

One item I gotta mention about my augs: despite the fact I have all these crazy superpowers that break reality, I look like a totally normal guy. There’s no cybernetic arms, no glowing eyes, no cool circuit-like patterns in my skin. Well, maybe not totally normal: my physique is godly — and I didn’t even work out to get it. After I got my augs I started noticing my belly fat disappearing and my arms getting larger, and eventually I looked like a fucking marble statue, 24/7. Whatever they stuck in me must also have a “godly physique protocol” somewhere.

Finally, the last thing I want to mention about my augs is… I have absolutely no goddamn clue how they work. I’m not even sure what they are *made of*. They were simply given to me via these needle-like injector devices and then take a few days to install and calibrate. If I had to guess it’s some kind of nanotechnology — or maybe a more advanced descendant of nanotechnology. But even if so, God knows how measly nanotechnology could let me control gravity and slow down time. I basically fight extradimensional monsters that defy reality and shouldn’t exist… using technology and gadgets that defy reality and shouldn’t exist. The irony hasn’t escaped me.

Now that I’ve talked about all my fancy toys, I suppose I should mention the lifestyle: It's every sad, lonely man's fantasy come true; the fantasy where, despite being a loser and a nobody, some plot-device characters show up at your doorstep and say “Hey kid, you might be a total loser who women laugh at, but also you possess a special… *something,* that is unique and rare. Come with us, we gotta save the world.” Queue a few training montages, overcoming your fears, first initial quest that don’t quite go right, and BAM — you’re now a baddass who saves the world… any maybe even get the hot love interest at the end.

On top of that I have a rather ridiculous salary and access to safe houses in every major city, each one more luxurious than the last. My Benefactors have this amazing concierge service can get me anything I want, anywhere, anytime. Last month I wanted to try this obscure Japanese whiskey that's impossible to find. Six hours later, it was waiting for me in Moscow. 1923 vintage, too. Tried it too. Very mellow. Smooth, with hints of oak. The service also gets me into basically any exclusive club on the planet… even if I wasn’t on the guest list. A simple call to them… which, by the way, I can do using my Interface — no phones needed — and the gates to the world of pleasures part like the Red Sea.

And yes, you’re probably thinking how is my luck with the ladies these days. You name the type, I’ve probably slept with them. I’ve been with the hottest women on the planet, a few big names that you’ve definitely heard of, but I won’t mention… out of courtesy to them, particularly since many were married and/or in a relationship when we hooked up. I’ve even had to turn down a few offers because my… schedule is so busy. Funny how these women suddenly find me irresistible once they realize I can take them to exclusive events and rub elbows with people they only dreamed about meeting. I can see right through them, of course. I mentioned before, my Interface helps me read people, helps me say exactly the right things at the right time. The old Marcus, the awkward IT guy who couldn't get a date to save his life? He's gone. This new version of me is smooth, confident, mysterious, dangerous.

My life sounds perfect, doesn’t it? I got money. I got girls. I got power. And my Benefactors don't seem to care what I do in my off time, so long as I drop everything and punch out Cthulhu whenever they say ""jump"". It's everything I dreamed of when I was nobody. Robert Howard, the guy who wrote the original *Conan the Barbarian* stories, once said that he wanted both *money* and *muscle* — because muscle lets you beat the shit out of people when necessary — money lets you get away with it. Okay, that wasn’t the *exact* quote but it’s the gist of it. Well, I definitely got money and muscle. I got an absurdly high salary and I can kick any man’s ass on the planet, hell I can fight off multiple men with one arm. Connor McGregor? Please, I’d cave his face in before his mind registered it. That dude who played The Mountain in *Game of Thrones*? (the actor who showed up in later seasons) Imagine his shock when he sees me effortless lift several times his limit, then punch him so hard his heart stops.

Hell, more than once I’ve saved a woman at a club or an event from groups of grabby men, and let me tell you: when a woman sees you beat the shit out of a group of men effortlessly, then sees you fold the bouncers like cheap suits when they try to put your hands on you... it ignites something primal in their brains. Feminism goes out the window. Those ladies basically worshiped me from then on... ever seen those Frank Frazetta illustrations of some barbarian hero posing while a scantly clad woman is wrapped around his leg? Yeah, that's what it's like.

So…

I’ve told you about my incredible life. I’m a baddass super-agent Sentinel working for a mysterious organization, I got awesome gadgets that make me superhuman. I get paid a fuck ton to do it, and I live life large.

So why am I sitting here, looking down from the 127th floor, wishing for it all to end? You must think I’ve lost my mind. I used to dream about being special. Now I am. I'm probably one of the most special people on Earth.

And now I’m lonelier than I’ve ever been in my life… and even worse —

I’m not sure I’m even in control of my body. I'm not sure if it's really ""me"" who's the baddass super agent... because as time goes on, I feel more and more like I'm actually just a vessel for... something else.

I recently bought the breville express to impress to save money from buying coffee from stores. 
I’ve been experimenting on my breville and just wanted thoughts if I was doing this correctly.
I’ve heard to use fresh coffee beans so I did go to my local coffee store and bought some. They told me it’s from onxy monarch beans(haven’t heard of these) 

These are the experiments I’ve done. 

1: my inner grinder set to 5 outer set to 20. This poured in 28.30 seconds 

2: same inner grinder but outer set to 18 poured in 27.36 seconds (the scale on the machine wasn’t in the middle) 

4: inner 5 outer 4 (was way to slow) at 1:01 (nothing but some drops came out) 

I then tried changing my inner to 4 and out to 16 and this resulted in nothing coming out as well. 

I’ve heard it’s best for the shot to pour is around 25 seconds. 
I’m thinking of buying the lavazza beans (I like a more medium -light roast heard many people like these) 
Any thoughts? Making sure I’m doing this correctly 

Thank you!

1htj5te,https://www.reddit.com/r/dreamingspanish/comments/1htj5te/300_hours_and_trip_to_puerto_rico/,300 hours and trip to Puerto Rico!!,"**Motivation:** 

About 5 years ago, I started dating a Puerto Rican guy (now we're married), so I decided to pick up learning spanish again after a long break. If I wanted to talk to his family and get to know them, I needed to learn spanish. Some people in his family speak English (of varying degrees), but some don't. Either way, its more comfortable for them to speak spanish. And my husband feels like he is more of his true self in spanish, so I want to be a part of that. 

**Background:**

About 10 years ago, I took spanish classes during high school. I promptly stopped learning it after that and forgot most of the memorized words and grammar. I was actually decent with speaking by the end of it because we practiced that so much, but my listening comprehension was always so bad. 

When I started spanish again, I tried Duolingo first. After several months of consistent Duolingo, I took my first trip to Puerto Rico to meet his family for the first time. And I was sooooo disappointed by how little I could understand of his family's conversations. I could only really understand the topic of the conversation and nothing more. I was definitely lacking listening practice and realistic expectations of the language learning journey. I stopped learning spanish for a while since I was so discouraged. 

After a while I started my learning back up with a combination of methods: duolingo (still), podcasts (coffee break spanish, storylearning, duolingo podcast, etc), lingopie (for the free trial), learning a word a day with my husband, and lots of flashcards of all the words I encountered with those methods. These methods never really resonated with me and it was hard to tell if they were working at all. I think the podcasts and lingopie that I tried were too hard for the level I was at. 

I gave myself 100 hours for my background in spanish when I started Dreaming Spanish. I based it on the descriptions of the different levels on the roadmap and on how hard I thought superbeginner(easy) vs. beginner vs. intermediate(too hard) videos were.

**My Dreaming Spanish Journey (so far!):**

* 100 hours (right when I started Dreaming Spanish) - I was so happy when I found DS, since it immediately stood out from the other language learning companies and methods. It was clear about how long and how much time it would take to get to various stages of spanish learning. I appreciated the honesty. And it went really well with my existing youtube habits. I was watching beginner DS videos at a difficulty of around 35 when I started and maybe only 15-30 minutes a day (not that consistently yet).
* 150 hours (50 hours into DS) - I was always trying to watch the hardest videos I could since I thought that that would give me the most progress. I was watching mostly beginner videos of up to a difficulty of 45. Around 150 hours, I started listening to podcasts (chill spanish and un dia en espanol).
* 175 hours - This reddit community taught me that watching easier content is often more beneficial, so I stopped trying to push the difficulty as much. I started watching a mix of superbeginner, beginner, and the easiest intermediate videos up to a difficulty of 45-50. Whatever videos looked interesting at the time. I started exploring youtube (I loved Spanish after Hours' beginner playlist) in addition to watching those same podcasts plus Help Me Learn Spanish Joel (which I listened to sometimes while doing tedious experiments in the lab). I was more consistently getting 30 minutes a day.
* 200 hours - I increased my daily goal to an hour a day! Slowly increasing the difficulty I could watch comfortably while still watching a lot of easy content. I really enjoyed the unpacking series from Learn Spanish with Indie Games on youtube. 
* 250 hours - Constantly getting 1-2 hours per day! I started listening to a decent amount of Learn Spanish and Go podcast and could watch DS videos in the lower 50s. 
* 300 hours - I'm watching DS videos up to a difficulty of 59, but I think I could watch most intermediate videos as long as I have the energy to pay attention more. 
* Reflections - Its very motivating to see the progress in my listening abilities. My husband has figured out how to speak to my level of Spanish this fall and is finally on board with the idea that the input has to be comprehensible to be useful for learning. I've improved enough to understand some conversations he has on the phone with his family...he now tells his brothers not to talk about anything they won't want me to overhear. A month ago, my husband was in the middle of brushing his teeth and was trying to tell me something in English. I had no idea what he was saying even with repeating himself, so he said it in spanish and I instantly understool. Haha that made me feel like a million bucks. 

**My trip to Puerto Rico for Christmas:**

All of my husband's family were noticing how much better I could understand Spanish on this trip. 200 hours of comprehensible input has helped my listening comprehension of their Puerto Rican Spanish even though I haven't been getting much Puerto Rican input except for a little bit of crosstalk. My husband was trying to teach his family how to speak in a way that I could understand their spanish (slower, more clear, less slang, not dropping syllables of words). He was successful in teaching his mom and grandma, not so much in teaching his dad and brothers. I think his mom is the most patient, and his grandma is very strict on her spanish grammar unlike the others. His dad is from China, so speaks with a Chinese-Puerto Rican accent which I find very difficult to understand at this point...and he doesn't know what words are slang or what syllables of words Puerto Ricans tend to drop in their pronunciation. His brothers just use a ton of slang and slur their words more and are used to speaking with me in English since they live in the US. 

I had some very nice crosstalk conversations with my mother in law every day of this trip! (She understands English well, but is less comfortable speaking it) It made me very happy that I could connect with her. Having a million DS videos of people telling personal stories definitely prepared me for those conversations! While one-on-one conversations were decent for me, conversations with the whole family were more hit or miss depending on the topic and the manner of discussion. Some parts of the conversations I could understand 90%, some 80%, some 50%, some I was completely lost in. It's exhausting to try to listen to native speakers speaking to native speakers at this point. I had to zone out of a lot of conversations because my energy was spent. The hardest conversations to listen to were (1) when the family was making decisions or plans, so they were going back and forth quickly and changing their minds every 2 seconds. And (2) when in a larger group with my husband's extended family. There was a lot of background noise, people talking over each other, and quickly and excitedly speaking. 

Overall, I am happy with the progress I've made this year. Before DS, I could only really tell what the topic of the family discussions was and a few easier phrases. I have a lot of learning to go before I will be able to comfortably follow the family's native speaking to native conversations, but I trust this process. I think the roadmap is accurate to my stage right now. I can definitely understand resources or people that know how to talk to spanish learners and at this point some patient speakers. 

Onward to getting more input!! This year, I want to add more Puerto Rican input and crosstalk. I'll be searching around for some, but none of the Puerto Rican input on the spreadsheet are comprehensible for me yet Let me know if you have any other recs (regardless of level) and at what point those became comprehensible. I'm thinking I'll add some other Caribbean input since that's better than nothing (first on my list is the Slow Dominican Spanish podcast). I was so excited to hear about the promise of a new DS guide from the Caribbean. That is exactly what I need!

We just returned from a 9-day Christmas trip. We always go to Kauai because it feels a little less crowded. At least it used to....there's a whole lot more tourists there these days who drive dangerously, cut in front of you in line for, say, a coffee, drive rental e-bikes through the resort, on sidewalks, in traffic and bring loads of relatives along to do the same. Sadly, our rental car was plowed into on xmas eve while we went to church and out to eat. Even the police refused to help. Be careful where you park.
Anyhow, if you're wanting to check out Kauai, I'd suggest Kapaa. Its a perfect location for adventures to the north (Hanalei) or south (Poipu). There's an incredible bike path and some great eateries (Lemongrass Grill for example). I would choose Kauai Shores over Aston on the Beach however. We paid for a room with 2 double beds and a ""partial ocean view"" at the Aston. We got stuck with a room by the parking lot over the check-in area. You could see the ocean but also a lot of buildings, the pool, etc. inbetween. There is no housekeeping save for one visit if you stay beyond 5 days. There's only a microwave, mini fridge and Kuerig coffee maker in the rooms. Although nearby Coconut Grove has eats and coffee, it's very expensive. I would say the worst part was when our room contained a queen bed and an old sleeper sofa. And no sheets the first night. The manager tried to gaslight us by saying that's what we reserved...not so. Otherwise we made the best of things but Kauai has sure changed in the 20 years I've been traveling there.",1,1736010981.0,u_charbeatty,0,1.0,False

Hey there, fellow earthlings! 🌍

You know that feeling when someone cuts you off in traffic and you think, “Wow, what an asshole!”? Or when someone at work just can’t seem to handle their coffee without spilling it all over your already chaotic desk? Yeah, been there. It’s enough to make anyone want to start a support group for the wronged. But wait! Before we start drafting our “No Assholes Allowed” signs, let’s take a moment to ponder: what if those assholes need love too? 

Hear me out! Behind every less-than-warm interaction, there’s likely a complex tapestry of stress, insecurity, and perhaps too many late-night Netflix binges. I mean, who hasn’t been a bit of an “asshole” at some point? Maybe we were hangry, maybe we had a rough day, or maybe we just stepped on our pet’s tail (sorry, Fluffy!). 

Let’s break it down: 

1. **They’re Human Too**: Just like you and me, they experience bad days, emotional roller coasters, and that pesky phenomenon known as life. Sometimes, people act out as a way of coping with their problems. Everyone deserves a little understanding, even if they’re giving you the side-eye from across the street.

2. **Inner Child Alert**: A lot of “asshole behavior” can actually be traced back to childhood. Maybe they never learned how to share and now treat every conversation like a tug-of-war! Recognizing this can make it a tad easier to extend a little grace instead of rolling your eyes.

3. **Revolutionary Idea**: What if the next time someone behaves like a complete jerk, you respond with empathy? I know, I know—it sounds radical! But a simple “Hey, are you okay?” could go a long way. Might just turn that frown upside down! And who knows, you might even make a friend or, at the very least, avoid that all-too-common “the jerk won today” feeling.

4. **Love, Not War**: At the end of the day, isn’t the world a more pleasant place with a sprinkle of kindness? Even the most hardened “asshole” might crack a smile when someone offers them a little understanding. And if nothing else, you’ll score major good karma points.

5. **Laugh It Off**: Sometimes, the best way to deal with an asshole is to laugh at the absurdity of it all. “Look at that person, mad over their lopsided sandwich!” It’s ridiculous, really. So, instead of fuming, find the humor in it. Nothing breaks tension faster than a good chuckle.

So, the next time you encounter someone who’s acting like a total jerk, remember that beneath the prickly exterior, there’s often a person wrestling with their own challenges. Yes, assholes need love too, even if they don’t always know how to ask for it. So let’s sprinkle some extra kindness into the universe—even in the craziest of circumstances!

Stay kind, stay curious, and don’t forget: we’re all just a bunch of wonderfully flawed humans trying our best. And a little love never hurt anyone—perhaps even the assholes among us! 💖

1htj1z8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmITheAngel/comments/1htj1z8/aitah_for_telling_my_husband_that_my_best_friend/,AITAH for telling my husband that my best friend “cheated” on her husband?,"A couple of days ago my (40F “Wilma”) husband (42M “Fred”) were having dinner and kind of out of the blue says he stopped in for coffee at a local shop and saw my best friend (40F “Jane”) having coffee a man that wasn’t her husband. Fred has only met Jane’s husband (M42 “George”) once so he doesn’t really know him, but he knows what he looks like. He said they had their laptops open, but they seemed to be having an intense conversation.

I knew Jane had a big project going on at work and she told me her team often went out to local coffee shops or restaurants to work because it was quieter than their loud “open concept” office. I told this to Fred, but he kind of brushed it off and pressed the point. “But they were looking so intently into each other’s eyes!” 

Fred works in construction, so he doesn’t really understand office work, so I told him, “Fred, they’re working on a big project with a tight deadline—there’s a lot of money at stake—of course there‘s going to be some intense conversations.” Then he said, “I know what I saw Wilma—that look wasn’t because of any office project.” 

Fred just gets so worked up sometimes and I had had enough of the conversation, so I said VERY SARCASTICALLY “Right Fred, you got me, Jane admitted she was having an affair with a coworker and they’d go to the coffee shop and pretend to work and then sneak off to the bathroom to bang in one of the bathroom stalls. She also bribed a barista to put an out-of-order sign on the door while they were in there so they wouldn’t get caught. And you figured it all out while waiting in line for your coffee.” Fred was quiet for a minute and then just got up and went out into the garage like he usually does after dinner. 

I didn‘t think anything about it until I got a frantic call a couple of days later from Jane. She said her husband had accused her of cheating and was going to get a divorce and paternity tests for their two children (9M and 15F). She said she told him she wasn‘t cheating and why did he even think that, George explained that Fred had called him about the coffee shop thing and that I had confirmed it with all the details. I tried to explain what happened, but Jane was crying too much. (Later, after she calmed down, I explained what happened and she understood—she knows how Fred is—and really she’s angry with George for listening to a random lunatic like Fred.).

I got so fed up with Fred, I took our daughter (f9 mo) and went to stay with my mother. Now I’m getting constant calls and texts from Fred asking what he did wrong. He keeps saying, “if someone’s being cheated on, you gotta tell them, even if it’s a stranger.” My mother never liked Fred so she’s on my side. And our friends are split—some say Fred was right to do it even if he really didn’t know for sure—some sort of “guy code” I guess. And others think he should have stayed out of their business, regardless. 

Now I’m torn. AITAH.

Responding to the comments

1. No one was cheating on anyone! Please actually read the story. I put “cheating” in quotes in the title because I was being sarcastic.

2. Stop DM-ing me and calling me a “cheating whore.” The story isn’t even about me cheating! Bots!

3. What does “better safe than sorry“ even mean here?

I watched the entirety of Maid For My Nemesis and everyone keeps mentioning how Lucas has this reputation of being a douchebag and an F-boy, but no one elaborated on it? What did he do? We’re just supposed to believe it? We’re not even given that impression when the series starts. He’s just competing for senior president and, yeah, his campaign was not well thought out or super convincing, but it wasn’t awful. Perhaps I’m looking too deep into it.

Also, Emma never explains why Lucas is her nemesis. Again we’re going back to how Lucas is only said to be a jerk with very little evidence or context backing it. When Lucas comes into the diner (I believe their second ever interaction in the series) he defends her and offers her a high-paying job. Doesn’t really seem to be something a known nemesis would do. Honestly, it doesn’t even seem like the two would be people who interact on a regular basis, so is Emma just getting her information from other people and creating this character in her head about Lucas?

I get the maid outfit he forced her to wear might be a red flag here, but it’s hardly that bad and, otherwise, he’s not really sexually harassing her. I’d also like to add that Lucas is paying Emma thousands of dollars a week to vacuum and make him coffee, so I think he is entitled to ask for a decent cup.

Imagine walking into your favorite coffee shop, spotting a sleek Bitcoin BTM (Bitcoin Teller Machine), and using it to buy a latte with crypto faster than you can say, “blockchain.” Welcome to 2025, where Bitcoin BTMs have become as common as ATMs, and our trusty **Bitcoin QR Code Maker app** ([https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com)) is making every transaction smoother than a double-shot espresso.

# What Are Bitcoin BTMs?

For the uninitiated, Bitcoin BTMs are the crypto world’s answer to traditional ATMs. But instead of spitting out cash, they’re designed to facilitate cryptocurrency transactions. Need to buy Bitcoin? Done. Want to sell some for cash? Easy. Bitcoin BTMs are your one-stop-shop for all things crypto.

These machines are popping up everywhere—cafes, malls, airports, even gas stations. They’re bridging the gap between digital currency and the physical world, and in 2025, they’re the go-to tool for anyone wanting to dive into the world of crypto.

# Why Bitcoin BTMs Are Taking Over

Bitcoin BTMs are more than just a convenience; they’re a revolution. Here’s why they’re the hottest thing in finance:

1. **Instant Transactions**: Forget waiting for bank transfers or dealing with complicated exchanges. BTMs let you buy or sell crypto in seconds.
2. **User-Friendly**: With intuitive interfaces and straightforward instructions, even crypto newbies can navigate them with ease.
3. **Global Accessibility**: Bitcoin BTMs operate 24/7, making them accessible to anyone, anywhere, at any time.
4. **Privacy**: Unlike traditional financial institutions, BTMs require minimal personal information. Just scan your QR code (more on that in a minute) and you’re good to go.
5. **Cash and Crypto Fusion**: These machines allow you to switch seamlessly between cash and crypto, making them perfect for everyday use.

# Enter the Bitcoin QR Code Maker App

While Bitcoin BTMs are undeniably cool, they wouldn’t be nearly as efficient without a trusty sidekick: the **Bitcoin QR Code Maker app**. Our app is like the Robin to the BTM’s Batman, ensuring every transaction is quick, seamless, and hassle-free.

# What Does the App Do?

The Bitcoin QR Code Maker app is your ultimate tool for generating Bitcoin QR codes. Whether you’re receiving payments, setting up wallet addresses, or making transactions at a BTM, our app makes it ridiculously easy.

# Why It’s a Game-Changer

[Part Three]","The first thing Cullen was told, before even walking into Ron's office, was that he could only use nicknames. They even had him sign a short waiver that, more or less, said it was his responsibility if his real name got out and nobody in Society could be held liable for the consequences that would potentially occur Outside. He found the little pictograph of someone being dragged off into a dark alley after writing a full name, middle initials included, to be quite... Illustrative.

He almost slipped up despite it when he introduced himself, when he went to meet with the communications officer of this section of the wall. Far as he knew, communication was important enough out here they, more or less, were the gods of diplomacy between the in and out. Ron sipped fruit juice from his coffee mug, loudly and somehow pointedly, as a way of cutting Cullen off mid-sentence. He came up with Cullen on the spot. He'd heard it meant 'wolfhound', or something similar, so it felt appropriate enough.

The office was cramped, but not because it was small. In fact, it was fairly large. It had to be, to accommodate the many, many lights, buzzers, switches, buttons, and monitors that loomed over him and whoever was on the other side of his desk at all times. It was like the cold, unfeeling eye of the government was in the room with you, waiting for mistakes. But it wasn’t you they were watching, it was all the things that weren’t inside their walls.

“So... I see you guys like pictures.""

“Not everyone can read. Don't want anyone dying because they can't read.” Ron was at least twice his age. His skin was dark and weathered, and his eyes were invariably examining, like he didn’t need to know you to know you: he just needed a quick glance, and everything in your head was bared for his interpretation. He was of an older generation, and Cullen was told he’d had firsthand experience from the start of the Change.

“Is it really that dangerous?""

“Names have power, kid. People can find you, and things that aren't quite people, pretty quickly if they have your full name. It's why authors are legally required to have pennames now."" He sounded like he ate nails, his voice was so scarred, or smoked the whole pack when he got cigarettes.

“I'll keep that in mind if I ever write a book.""

“And when you do paperwork. I must stress I am absolutely not kidding.""

Cullen just stared at him. And Ron just moved on.

“So. You want to be a border boy. Why? Honest answers only. Nobody likes liars around here.”

“Is this really-”

“Yes.”

Cullen sighed. “Okay. My… Friends. Friendly friends. Fits. I want to make sure everyone gets through alright.”

“And?” Ron waited. Waited just long enough, sipping fruit juice out of his coffee mug like it was his god given mission to defy its intended use, that Cullen grudged out an answer.

“My dad.”

“Files say you were raised by a stranger.”

“Don’t call him that.” Cullen had to keep himself from clenching his fists.

“Okay. Continue.”

Cullen paused. He debated getting up and leaving, but he looked out the window. Ron had a full bird’s eye view of the Outside, and Society. To Cullen’s left, endless dark trees, with hints of other things on the horizon. Mountains that didn’t quite make sense with where they were placed on the board. Patchworks of landscape that obviously didn’t belong where they were, but blatantly defied logic. Somewhere, over all that, an unknown nobody had ever seen. No matter where you were in the Outside, three directions led to Society. One led to a place nobody ever went, and the people who tried to make the number less negligible never came back, or they wouldn’t tell you what they saw. Couldn’t.

At least, never in a way that made the picture full: you were only allowed glimpses.

If Cullen looked right, there it was. A familiar landscape, with a familiar series of roads, leading to a familiar city where everyone was normal, no matter where they came from. Nothing out of order, nothing out of place.

He cleared his throat, turned back to Ron’s patient gaze. “I’ve heard a lot of people tell me my dad wasn’t real because of where he came from. That some of my friends, my neighbors, coworkers… Weren’t real. That they were just pretending.”

“And how does that make you feel?”

“...This isn’t therapy.” His correction got no reaction, so he just kept on. “I don’t like it. I don’t like that, if some of them just disappeared, nobody would bat an eye or ask where they went.”

“And your father…”

“I know what you’re going to say. Yes. Part of me hopes maybe I’ll just see him walk up to the checkpoint one day. But… It’s both.”

“Does any part of you want to know what’s at the far end of the road? Before you say you don’t know what I mean, no, you do. And it’s important.”

Cullen didn’t answer right away. But he did, and he did it honestly. “I do. But I don’t want to know where I’ll go, if I don’t come back.”

Ron studied him. Cullen felt like he was thinking about something more than just professional interview etiquette and job safety. Cullen watched him turn his thoughtful blue eyes towards the Outside. He leaned back in his big black arm chair, all dark leather and comfort. Cullen wondered if he got the good chair because he was important here, or if he’d just brought it up here and nobody cared enough to question it.

“I gotta ask some really specific questions. They might be off-putting, but again, honest answers.”

“Okay.”

“Are you comfortable with repeating phrases, with little variation? Are you comfortable with being called in to replace other staff in an emergency? Are you comfortable with strange gifts? Are you comfortable with interacting through barriers? Are you comfortable with staring something in the eye at the risk of varying side effects?”

Cullen answered yes to every question, with increasing discomfort. He fidgeted a bit in his chair. His was old wood, beaten and weathered, with strange phrases carved into it.

“Quick answers, kid. You sure?”

“I know they have to do weird things at the border already. Half of it’s the same stuff we do back home every day, isn’t it? Just-”

“With more consequences.” Ron looked towards him again, turned to face him. He put down his mug, and he clasped his hands together. He smiled. Stared Cullen right in the eye. “Tell me, what makes you think I’m human?”

“I’m sorry?”

“I’m looking you in the eye. You can see all my little appendages.” He wriggled his hands. Opened his mouth, briefly, stuck out his tongue in an almost child-like gesture. It was almost insulting. “But if you looked past the desk and saw I didn’t have feet, how would you feel?”

“Uh… Like you need to go to the hospital.”

Ron paused. His eyes flashed with a bit of good humor, but it dropped just as quick. “Okay, take away one of my eyes. Hell, both of them. Pull out my teeth, my tongue, or maybe I don’t have a mouth. Maybe I’ve got no hands.”

“Where is this going?”

“Would you feel uncomfortable? Maybe afraid?”

“Depends on-”

“Now what if I had all these things, but I was lying to you? Maybe there’s eyes on the back of my head, and I’m actually blind right now.” Ron stood up, did a little twist. He had gray hair, and if there was some secret third eye, Cullen wasn’t seeing it.

“Oh.”

“Oh is right, kid.” Ron sat down. There was a bit of weight to it, like he was suddenly tired. “Now here’s another, and a lot of this is off-script, but bear with me: what if I got into an awful accident. I don’t know, maybe I got run over by a milk truck, and some of that stuff was gone. Am I someone else, or am I Ron?”

Cullen thought about it. It seemed like a trick question. Yes was obvious, no was also obvious. No, because he was supposed to watch for discrepancies at this job. “I don’t know.”

“Exactly.” Ron smiled again, but he looked like he was almost uncomfortable doing it. “People and strangers are basically the same thing, unless they’re not. Some of us keep our skin the same on both sides of the wall. Others try to fit in.” And he leaned close again, looked at Cullen like he was trying to figure out if he, sitting right here in the sectional communications officer’s own den, was a trickster himself. “Do you know why I’m rambling right now, about this?”

“Because it’s important to the job.”

“Because it’s important to the job, and keeping the job from becoming too professional.” He leaned back, finished off his fruit juice, dropped every bit of humor from his voice. It contrasted sharply with his relaxed posture. “Here’s what this job actually is. They don’t want me to bring you in this way, since it turns away candidates, but they also know damn well it’s the truth, so they never stop me. You’re not here to turn people away or let them in. You’re here to bear the burden of feeling out which side of the wall they belong on.”

There was a period of quiet. Maybe it was to let the old man’s words sink in, maybe Ron just wanted him to process. “Can I ask something?” Cullen’s voice was lower, a bit tentative.

“Always.”

“You’re talking about our job - your job - like it doesn’t matter. So… What’s the point, then?”

“Formality.” There was another silence, one where Cullen waited for Ron to follow up with some more long-winded explanation. He got one, in a way. Ron adjusted his position, rested his head on his hand as he looked out at Society. “If I picked up my mug and tried to break your nose, what would happen?”

“What?” Cullen pursed his lips. “I’d hit back.”

“And?”

“One of us, or both of us, would go to jail.”

“The point is to keep that making sense. If I walked all the way to the ends of the earth, out into that great unknown, maybe I’d come back with all the answers. Maybe I’d find none. Maybe, there’d be someone sitting at a desk over there, with a bunch of lights-” Ron gestured to the alert boards. “-With someone in a box telling them what to do about me.” He pulled out a cigarette, lit it right in front of Cullen.

Cullen didn’t bother pointing out the lack of professionalism. It didn’t seem like it mattered.

The old man continued. “I’m going to tell them to hire you now. I’m going to hand you some pamphlets, when you come back. You seem like a reasonable kid, who will listen when I tell you to do something, and maybe you’ll listen to the other people who I rotate with. But-”

“But?”

“-I need you to remember that we don’t know much. I can’t tell you where they came from, or why they came now. But I can tell you a few things: the more like us they seem, the less they have to learn, the more you should walk on eggshells. There will always be rules, and they will invariably be mostly bullshit. But they’ll be rules, so they’ll need to be followed.” He pulled an ashtray out of his desk, like putting out the cigarette was his equivalent to pulling out the bottle, not pulling out the bottle itself. “Nobody likes rule breakers. Not even them.”

Cullen wanted to ask if he meant them or the strangers, but it clicked: it didn’t matter.

Cullen was asked another series of questions. He was asked if he was comfortable working with strangers. He said yes. He was asked if he could be trusted to follow instructions, and he said yes. He was asked if he had any useful skills, and he gave them. He was asked if he had any mementos he wanted to bring in, and only hesitated when asked if he’d give them up if necessary. Finally, he was asked if he understood he was putting his life at risk, of his own volition, and if he understood that he would be severely punished if he intentionally neglected his duties and put others at risk.

He said yes.  
\---

When Ron returned from his authorized vacation days, Cullen did not ask to be let into Ron’s office. He did not ask for permission to put the note and the photo from the tube on his desk, sit down, and ask him what the hell it meant.

“It means we’re getting an inspection.” Ron answered, smoothly despite his half-burnt tone.

“From who?” Cullen asked. His voice was not smooth. It was not calm, in either sense.

“I don’t know. But be on your best behavior.”

“Excuse me?” Cullen’s muscles tensed as he felt himself quickly losing his cool. He took a deep breath, looked Ron in the eye as he was about to say something, then tossed the photo onto his desk. Ron stared at it. He blinked, briefly off-balanced, before fully focusing his attention on Cullen. Facing him in full now.

“Do you remember when I said I don’t know what’s on the other side?” Ron didn’t wait to follow up. He started to pull out a cigarette, paused, and put the pack back. The gesture was enough to get Cullen to hold off for a moment. “I think I used to. I’m pretty sure I used to remember what the actual name of the place we walled up was, too. I’m pretty sure I could place a name on every town out in that hellscape-” And he flicked his eyes to the Outside. “But I can’t now.”

“And why not? What is making you - making everyone - forget, Ron?”

“I don’t know. But what I know is that, the ones who are meant to come inside act like they belong, and the ones that aren’t… They take things. Sometimes, they take each other. Sometimes, its places. The things we really want to keep, we stop naming. There’s special ones. Ones that like to keep things… Proper, who come around sometimes. More proper than normal.”

“Why doesn’t anyone else know about the extra rules? Why’d I learn half this shit going out to the walls?”

“You know how people leave their coat, and their shoes, at the entrance? You don’t have to wear your shoes past the door. If someone tracks mud in anyways, nobody wants them in the house.”

“Come on, Ron. Cut the dance-around shit.”

“You don’t need them inside. You just need them outside. And nobody wants there to be nowhere to go, so my guess is there’s someone who wants to do our job, their way.”

“What do I do, Ron? Advise me. It’s your job.”

Cullen expected Ron to look angry. Instead, he just looked… Hollow. He slumped into his big fancy chair. Now he took out the cigarette, now he lit it. “You follow the rules, so that they keep making sense to everyone inside. I’ll do the best I can to help, and Tommy will too, and so will Lupe.” There was a pause. A tension. Ron leaned forward, looked Cullen in the eye like he always did when he really wanted to communicate something’s importance. “Cullen.”

Cullen didn’t say a word, looked slightly aside. Out the window, towards Outside. Ron spoke anyway.

“The ones who we let in. The ones we were supposed to let in. There’s no… Conspiracy. If you’re meant to be inside, you’re meant to be inside. That’s all there is to it. Don’t look at ‘where from’, but ‘who is’.” Ron closed his eyes briefly. Cullen almost let that be all there was to it. The conversation was over and all that was left to do was quietly return to work. But there was one last thing.

“Why did you take this job, Ron?”

Ron blinked, caught off guard. He laughed, shook his head. “I’m waiting for someone to come back, too.” His voice didn’t have any humor in it, just… Other things. The humor faded from his face with the next sentence. “I want there to be something for them to come back to. That’s all.”

Cullen left his office. He was not stopped by security, and it dawned on him that maybe Ron had known he’d be storming up to his office and just did not care. Or, he’d already known what was going to happen, with the ‘inspector’ and their ‘notice’ or warning or whatever it had been. Either someone called him before he got back, or…

It didn’t matter, either way. For all he knew they just didn’t have leftover staff for it. And it wasn’t Ron’s job to let people in, it was his.

When he returned to the checkpoint booth area, he sat down. Flexed his fingers, picked up his mug. He didn’t drink from it, it was empty right now. He stared at it, instead. Even after all these years, it still made sense to him that he hadn’t been left behind on purpose. And it still made sense to do his job. What didn’t make sense anymore was all the little lines in the sand, which ones were real and which ones weren’t.

He looked over at Lupe. Let himself actually look at her, for the first time in days. He knew what she was, everyone did. They showed each other on the first day, to diffuse the tension of knowing but not seeing it. Her hair was short clipped, her face was completely in line with the exact image you’d have in your head if you only thought of a stranger as someone you didn’t quite get a good look at going down the street: plain, pleasant if you cared, nothing important if you didn’t.

But he didn’t think she was hiding what she hid because she was trying to lie to anyone. If she were trying to hide anything, she wouldn’t be shaking right now. Cullen followed her eyes towards the second window of the security checkpoint, watched her skim over every single monitor and alert system. He became uneasy because she was uneasy, his shoulders tensed because hers did.

He was afraid because he knew what she was, but she was never fully at ease when she went Outside. And he’d never seen her watch the window like that before.

Cullen pulled out the photo. He’d taken it back off Ron’s desk on the way out. He needed it in front of him so he knew it was real.

It was customary to have photos taken, when you did anything with strangers. It made the ones you wanted around feel normal, and it proved to the people you thought were normal that they showed up on camera still. It was also said that, sometimes, unfits would not show up, or you could catch them in the hidden corners of photos, and you’d know they were nearby. It was even said, if something was off about someone in a photo, it was because they were not meant to be there.

Ron was supposed to be there. So was Tommy, and Lupe, in all her strangeness, her real self. The Moss Man was meant to be there, too, having been caught in the background not long before he showed up properly and earned passage through the gates. There’d been a few others: some security officers, the ones that made double triple sure the people coming in were supposed to and that they hadn’t learned human tactics, like concealed firearms. Some of the comm aids, the other shifts… It was supposed to have at least two dozen people in it.

Only Cullen was there. And, if he looked, he could see people who he had never met, who did not look quite right, in the shadows between the trees. Cullen was slightly distorted in the photo, and he had no idea if that was an omen or not. This was a copy, the original was still in a scrapbook type folder somewhere, so could’ve just been a shitty print that got edited. But what he knew, for certain fact, was that he did not like that he was alone in it.

He liked it even less when he compared it to the apartment complex photo, from when he'd moved into the place he lived now, and noticed most of the other people who lived with him were still in it, except one specific individual. He’d seen him disappear on the monitor, into that closet, but he’d only seen his hand then. Cullen wondered if he was alone, wherever he was, and also wondered if that was good or bad. Part of him, selfishly, hoped he never found out. If he found out, he might also discover, for certain, that he was the reason he was gone.

He looked at Lupe again. He wanted to ask what she was afraid of. Almost opened his mouth and said the words. Then he decided he did not want to know. Instead, he wanted to make sure none of them found out.

1htiu6r,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewParents/comments/1htiu6r/my_11_month_old_hates_eating/,My 11 month old hates eating,"I need help… he just turned 11 months old and we’ve been struggling to get him to eat any solids. 

First of all, we have a VERY small apartment and don’t have a kitchen table to eat at, so we eat at the coffee table in the living room.

I’ve tried feeding him in a high chair at my work desk (in the kitchen) but he screams until we take him out. So I bought a portable high chair to sit on the coffee table to eat with us, but again he hates it.

The only time he will eat is if my husband is sitting at the table eating. He will come crawling/walking over and my husband will feed him little bits directly into his mouth or put  a piece on the table for him to grab.

However even with bottle feeds, we ALWAYS have to have a show for him to focus on, otherwise he WILL NOT sit still and eat. 

He won’t eat for me though, unless I’m holding him, have a show on, and spoon-feeding him purees. 

He starts daycare very soon and I’m so embarrassed that he’s so behind on eating properly. He just won’t sit still and is always needing to MOVE. The only thing that gets him to stay in one place is Miss Rachel or Baby Einstein puppets.

Idk what I’m gonna do in the mornings before work, as he needs to eat before daycare, but he won’t, and I won’t have time to fight with him on it.

Any tips or advice? I did buy a little toddler table and 2 chairs and am going to set up an area in the living room specifically for eating but I’m not hopeful.

Thanks in advanced.


Ps: i was gonna edit this above but the app won’t let me scroll up to do so… our kitchen is small, and there’s a small section that we had to move my office into (I work from home) and it’s also used for laundry and storage. There’s nowhere to put a kitchen table… I feel like that would have helped a lot in the beginning to set that routine :(",1,1736010181.0,NewParents,0,1.0,False

Im so distraught. She actually didn't know what i did for work until a week ago even though i told her. So maybe this is for the best. Please be honest with me.,"Its long but i would really appreciate your help.

So ill start off by giving a back story on the women I met a month and half ago. She has been single for 4 years and just had hookups. She is in zero contact with her parents and has been in zero contact with her dad for years with the occasional holiday or bday txt. She said that her mom let her dad get away with way too much in the context of talking about verabal abuse and men being violent.

Everything was good until we got into two bad fights over New Years. We were spending weekends together. I met her friends she met my friends and dad. She made it abundantly clear she was into me. I felt secure physically because physical touch was big with her. When it came to conversation she asked how my day was or what I did but didnt get much deeper than that. She asked me last week what I did for work. I told her what i did like the first or second date. I would tell her via txt "" i worked today"" along with other things when asked about what i did today . Yet never asked about my work specifically. She did have ADHD but that doesnt mean anything i guess other then she would have a hard time keeping up with txts so i guess she couldve missed my work txt. She never got deep into asking me question. You know the type of questions you ask when you like someone and want to understand how their mind works or what their needs were. If i asked she would repeat it back with the same question but never initiated.

She also told me one time she threw a french fry at a coworker bc he was being mean. She did it out of anger she said. She works in a small office that is not politically correct and has employees doing things a traditional place wouldnt do. She told me how crazy it was she did that. I replied ""well at least it wasnt a stapler. i mean a fry is harmless so i get thats why you did it."" She replied back ""yea"" and just laughed. Come to find out at her work xmas party she threw a mug at him too. Her boss was laughing about it and thats how i found out. I asked her i thought it was a fry and i feel like i was lied too. She played it off and said ""well you didnt really ask"". LOL like cmon really? I ignored it and the relaitonship continued to be good and healthy.

Then one day i said something that annoyed her. Didnt make her mad just annoyed her. I asked if she was okay 3 times and she said yes. Then 20 min later she snapped on me about something. it was mean and hurtful to me. She apologized saying it was mean and said it was because in fact she was not okay bc of what i said earlier that annoyed her. i said sorry for saying it. she said shes not use to all of this bc its been awhile since shes dated seriously. it was a good convo and we moved on.

New Years eve comes around and we had made plans two weeks ago to only spend time with her friends on NYE and me and her do something alone all day on NYD even though they were having a party on NYD. So New Years eve she said "" i told my friend id make this dish we can go for an hour"" i paused bc she didnt ask me. she told me. I said sure lets go two hours it will be good.

A couple hours before the NYE party i brought something up that was bothering me (maybe this was bad timing) after talking she sighed and walked off to the kitchen to make something. i followed her and said ""what do you think about what i said"". She said ""idk what to say"" i said "" are you okay"" she said yes but i since this was a repeat from the other time so i asked again and expressed how i felt like she isnt and she said ""im not doing this"" in a rude tone. I said bc im just kinda worried. ""she said i wont be okay if you keep pushing"" and got angry. I expressed how i hope she understands wehre im coming from bc i was nervous from what happened before. I wasnt trying to bring up and old argument just expressing my anxiety behind it and wanted it fixed before the party. it got a bit heated then we talked and it was fine.

NYD rolled around and we couldnt go to the party until 5 but was supposed to go at 1 but her friends slept in. So i was thinking we could do something after. we only got lunch and coffee that day. I was disappointed the party started later and we couldnt do any activity. i brought this up and she just kinda shut me down so i said yea but ""it just fucking sucks bc we cant do a fun a couple bonding activity im not trying to blame you and i couldve been better about planning"" then she just walks off and i asked her what she thought about that and just ignored me. So i walked out to cool down and then she got really mad at me for that. it turned into me raising my voice but then immediately calming down and saying sorry. Keep in mind she raised her voice at me on a separate occasion. She claims she didnt hear me say ""what do you think about that"" even though i was directly next to her. she said maybe i should go home but then we solved it. i said sorry for my actions but she never validated how i felt or acknowledged why i might be upset at the circumstance but not her. after the party she never once acknowledged she appreciated me coming and how we didnt get to really have an alone day.

that night we had sex for 45 min. She finished and I didnt. She tried finishing me for 5 minutes after her finishing but i was so tired it was a bit hard to be into it. I tried to slow it down and build up foreplay but she stopped and laid down. Didnt say any words. I asked ""are you done?"" she said yea. i said ""can we finish me."" she said ""we just tried to"". I said in a very calming and kinda playful manner ""yea but we only tried for 5-10 minutes im not trying to pressure you though"" then she said ""youre trying to pressure me"" and rolled over and got on her phone. Her back was turned to me. i felt hurt and finally called her out about how she shutdown all the time. i admit i was frustrated so didnt say it in a nice way. she pressed back talking about feeling pressured but i pressed on my side bc really i still hurt i was being shutdown. I then asked her to tell me why she felt pressured. I profusely apologized and said it was wrong of me to talk in such a way and i promise to never ask again after a no. I just felt like i was used a bit and not wanting to pressure her. this stemmed from everything else that happened that day.

next day she txt me saying she thinks we are incompatible mainly bc of our communication and lets break up. i tried to convince her that i have learned to give space during a conflict but didnt know this before about her bc we are still getting to know each other and how we operate. i also said i was not doing well on NYE and NYD due to extreme lack of sleep (i have narcolepsy). i also told her i had a great relationship that worked this way and it was healthy. she said everything was fine before these fights but says it was all too much and cant continue. i still tried to convince with some other txts but thats it.

Im in therapy and will talk about all of this. Im having issues with all of this bc our sexual chemistry was great and i got attached to how secure she made me feel with her physical touch.  Did i dodge a bullet due to early issues that showed up? Please give me your honest insight with how I acted as well. ",0,1736010019.0,relationship_advice,0,0.33,False

We are APs and just got off the Disney Dream for the NYE cruise (5 nights, Bahamian cruise). We used to be frequent cruisers pre-kids (Royal, Princess, Celebrity) and this was our first Disney cruise. Just wanted to thank everyone for their help with trip planning and share our thoughts. 

Ship: theming was nice but more Grand Floridian/Riviera style - not too much Disney but enough. Lots of special touches like the animations in the frames, tiling, and backdrops in the elevators (my kids loved the scenes as we went down/up). The layout of the ship was really great and easy to navigate. Ship was very clean and well maintained. Christmas decor was still up which was great. 

Cabin: our cabin mid-ship on 9 was fine for my husband, me, and 2 children ages 6 and 3. Our stateroom host was lovely and changed the sheets for the kids after the second night (tip from this board). My girls loved the Moana sheets! We had a deluxe family veranda and it was a good layout for us. We usually stay in one bedroom villas or suites at Disney but candidly the prices were obscene to jump to a concierge suite for a 5 night trip.

Food: Dining teams were great but food was overall a miss for us especially dinners and coffee. Coffees at vista or coves (extra price) were much better. We did eat at Palo and that was great. My only issue relates to dinner - Cabanas is closed at night so it seems your only option is the dining room (or pool deck pizza/burgers/tacos or room service with a similar menu). It feels really limiting to not have something easier to do at night. There were nights when our 3 year old was tired or we wanted to do the earlier show and it would have been nice to sit in Cabanas for a casual option that was not pizza. 

Disney islands: loved castaway! Lighthouse was a trek for families even in pleasant weather. Red Step 2 wagons were available for families to pull kids across the long dock/walkway at the start of the day and nonexistent at the end of the day. So many crying tired kids. My kids loved the splash pad at lighthouse though. We also didn’t realize that there was kids club at Castaway so we would try that next time. 

Entertainment and kids clubs: really enjoyed the shows and dance/deck parties. My kids loved the club! They begged to go. Royal gathering was fantastic. We also did BBB which was a huge hit. The new years festivities (fireworks, parties, kids club activities) were fantastic including a dance party with the major characters in the atrium. My kids loved this!

Overall, loved the Dream! Will definitely cruise Disney again. ",4,1736009909.0,dcl,5,0.83,False

chapter1

  
Mike Reeves pulled into the deserted parking lot of Riverside Mall at 10:45 PM, his headlights sweeping across rows of empty spaces. The massive building loomed against the October sky, its beige exterior illuminated by sodium vapor lamps that cast everything in a sickly orange glow. Like most malls in northern Pennsylvania, it sat just off the interstate, surrounded by acres of cracked asphalt and overgrown retention ponds. He'd worked security here for three years, but something about tonight felt different. Maybe it was the unusual stillness in the air, or maybe it was just knowing that Dave had quit last week, leaving him with a new partner to train.

He gathered his thermos and lunch bag, glancing at the dashboard clock as it blinked 10:46. Something about those green digital numbers reminded him of childhood nights spent staring at his alarm clock, convinced that the shadows in his room were moving.

The employee entrance was tucked between the old Service Merchandise loading dock and a permanently closed emergency exit. Mike's boots echoed against the concrete as he approached, keys jingling in his hand. The sound seemed to stretch and distort in the empty lot, bouncing off the walls until it didn't quite sound like footsteps anymore.

Tom was waiting inside the security office, already dressed in his uniform. He was younger than Mike had expected, probably mid-twenties, with neat black hair and wire-rimmed glasses that reflected the glow of the security monitors.

""Mike Reeves,"" he introduced himself, extending a hand. Tom's grip was firm but slightly damp with nervous sweat. ""Welcome to the graveyard shift at Riverside.""

""Thanks,"" Tom smiled, but his eyes kept darting to the bank of monitors behind them. ""I worked nights at the Target over in Willow Grove before this. But this place is... different.""

Mike nodded as he hung up his jacket. The mall had opened in 1992, riding the last wave of retail expansion before online shopping changed everything. Now, in 2003, more stores stood empty than occupied. The fountains had been drained years ago, their tiled basins collecting dust and discarded pennies. The food court, once bustling with six different restaurants, was down to just a Subway and a Chinese place that seemed to survive despite never having any customers.

""Different is one way to put it,"" Mike said, settling into his chair and pulling up the night's duties on the ancient computer. ""We do six rounds throughout the shift. Check all doors, look for any leaks or maintenance issues, make sure nobody's trying to camp out in the empty stores. Pretty standard stuff.""

Tom leaned forward, studying the patrol route displayed on the yellowed monitor. The mall's layout was simple enough - a long main corridor with two shorter wings forming a lopsided H. But something about the way the hallways appeared on the schematic made them look... wrong. Like an optical illusion where the proportions shifted when you weren't looking directly at them.

""What about the basement level?"" Tom asked, pointing to a grayed-out section of the map.

Mike's hand tightened imperceptibly on his coffee cup. ""Storage only. Management's orders - we don't go down there unless there's an emergency. Previous tenant disputes or something."" He took a long sip of coffee, avoiding Tom's questioning look. ""Ready for the first round?""

They gathered their flashlights and radio equipment, stepping out into the silent mall. Their footsteps echoed off the high ceiling, mixing with the quiet hum of fluorescent lights and the distant drone of the HVAC system. The storefronts stood dark and silent, their metal gates drawn like eyelids over empty displays.

As they passed the defunct Warner Bros. Store, Tom suddenly stopped. ""Did you see that?"" Mike turned. ""See what?""

""I thought..."" Tom adjusted his glasses, peering through the gate. ""I thought I saw something move in there. Like someone walking past the old display cases.""

Mike shined his flashlight through the metal grating. The beam caught dust motes swirling in abstract patterns, illuminating faded Looney Tunes characters whose painted smiles seemed more like grimaces in the harsh light.

""Probably just shadows from the emergency lights,"" Mike said. ""You'll see a lot of those on night shift. The mind likes to play tricks when things are too quiet.""

They continued their patrol, but Tom found himself studying the ceiling as they walked. The fluorescent lights created perfect squares of illumination on the floor, but something about their spacing seemed... irregular. He tried counting the tiles between each light, but the numbers never quite added up the same way twice.

They passed the Kay-Bee Toys, its windows cluttered with sun-faded clearance signs. The store's interior was a maze of empty shelves, their sharp angles creating odd geometric patterns in the dim emergency lighting.

""You'll get used to how things look at night,"" Mike said, marking something on his clipboard. ""Though sometimes I swear they rearranged these hallways when they built the place. Distances never seem quite right.""

Tom nodded, but said nothing. He was too busy trying to figure out why his footsteps sounded slightly out of sync with their walking pace, as if the echo was returning a fraction of a second too late.

When I contacted OpenAI about this, they were quick to refund the $191.52 to my credit card. But, in doing so they also canceled my subscription. I still had a little over half a month left on my subscription for ChatGPT Plus, that I use almost daily. Again, I reached out to them and they just responded by basically saying that they refunded me the $191.52 and that in charging me that amount they calculated my unused time and deducted that from the $200 payment when ""I upgraded to Pro."" Thus the $191.52 amount.

The thing is, I NEVER initiated nor confirmed an upgrade to Pro. I literally hadn't used ChatGPT the night before or the morning that my account was charged. 

I feel it's unfair that I now have to repay $20 when I just paid OpenAI $20 not even 14 days ago.

1htim56,https://www.reddit.com/r/dropshipping/comments/1htim56/the_reality_of_running_a_business_insights_from_a/,"The Reality of Running a Business: Insights from a Coffee Roaster
","Hey everyone,

I’m Miguel Olmos, a coffee roaster based in France and proud to have placed 3rd in the French Roasting Championship in 2023. I also run a brick-and-mortar coffee business where I sell my roasted coffee alongside coffee equipment and machines. Some of this equipment is dropshipped, but I also stock inventory in my warehouse.

I wanted to share some thoughts on what it really takes to build a sustainable and profitable business—especially for those venturing into dropshipping. This isn’t meant to discourage anyone but to bring some clarity about what being a business owner truly entails.

# You Can’t Build a Profitable Business with 0 Experience

While dropshipping is often sold as a “low-barrier” way to start, the reality is that running a business is a skill—and like any skill, it requires experience, discipline, and continuous learning.

Here’s my setup for context:

* **Main business:** A physical shop with a warehouse where I store inventory.
* **Operations:** I use a dedicated server that hosts my website (built on PrestaShop), accounting software, and cash machines for my shop. This setup costs me around **1,000€/month** for servers, software, and domains. These are fixed costs, regardless of the scale.
* **Logistics:** Years of experience in shipping, bulk purchasing, and supplier negotiations allow me to reduce costs and operate efficiently.

# A Casual Side Project: My Perfume and Skin Care Shop

To give you a different perspective, I casually created a dropshipping perfume and skin care shop because my ex was really into those products, also using Prestashop, for her I contacted several beauty brands and got direct deals from factories, got samples, went to some showrooms, expanded my contact list (even after finish the relationship lol). It’s basically running itself now with no attention from me. While it’s not making any meaningful profit overall, it pays for its own ads and stays afloat.

This isn’t a model I’d replicate for my main business, but it’s a fun experiment and shows how dropshipping can work if you set it up well. However, it’s important to note that this shop doesn’t represent true “success”—it’s just breaking even and ticking along in the background.

# Why I’m Exploring Dropshipping for My Main Business

With my established business, I’m considering dropshipping as part of a broader diversification strategy. Here’s why it makes sense in my case:

1. **Warehouse and logistics:** If demand grows, I can bulk order and store inventory. I already have established shipping deals and a reliable fulfillment process.
2. **Cross-promotion:** My brick-and-mortar shop attracts foot traffic, where I can market products and offer Click & Collect options.
3. **Credibility:** My business is 8 years old, which helps build trust with suppliers and negotiate better deals.
4. **Low additional costs:** For each new store, my only real expense is the domain since my existing infrastructure supports multiple websites.

# What You Should Know About Business

Running a business is so much more than just selling. It’s about:

* Understanding your market and products.
* Building relationships with suppliers and customers.
* Managing logistics and overhead.
* Constantly learning and adapting.

Dropshipping isn’t a shortcut to success—it’s just one model of many. Tools like Shopify can be convenient, but they’re often overpriced for what they offer. Building something sustainable requires careful planning and often significant upfront investment, whether that’s time, money, or both.

For those just starting out, I recommend thinking of business as a *career* rather than a quick way to make money. Every step you take—learning how to market, negotiate, or manage inventory—builds your foundation for long-term success.

I’d love to hear your thoughts or experiences. Let’s have an honest discussion about what it really means to build something worthwhile.

Cheers,

None of those app blockers will help you in the long term. You have to rewire your brain by doing other activities instead of scrolling on your phone all day. Spending time with others, reading books, and going out without your phone are the only effective ways to change.

## Chapter 1 - Breaking the Habit

""We get addicted or form habits around the things we do before going to sleep and after waking up.""

Keep this in mind—this is our building block for NoSurf. Turn off your phone and place it in another room 1-2 hours before going to bed. After waking up, focus on your tasks and wait at least 1-3 hours before using your phone.

Here are some things you can do during this time:

• Meditate

• Take in some sunlight

• Exercise

• Practice yoga

• Make yourself a good cup of coffee

• Take a shower

• Go to the gym

• Clean your living space

• Do your laundry

• Prepare breakfast


By doing this, if your daily screen time is 10 hours, you can cut out 2 hours right here.

## Chapter 2 -  Building New Habits / Passing Some Time

So, you’ve already completed the first step—congratulations! Now, let’s focus on passing an additional 1-2 hours without relying on your phone.

If your goal is to reduce your screen time by 2 more hours, here are some productive and enjoyable activities you can try:

• Read a book 

• Listen to music on a dedicated audio device like an iPod

• Spend quality time talking with your family

• Draw something creative, even if it’s just doodling

• Write anything—journaling, poetry, or even brainstorming ideas

• Practice good posture or work on improving how you carry yourself

• Play indoor games like board games or card games

• Go out and explore the world without taking your phone along

• Sing your favorite songs and enjoy the moment

• Use your thoughts to entertain yourself; reflect or imagine scenarios

• Play a memory game:


Memory Exercise:

1. Write 10 words on a piece of paper.


2. Give yourself just one minute to memorize them.


3. Then, rewrite as many as you can recall on another page.



This small yet effective exercise stimulates your brain and keeps you engaged without a screen. Remember, the goal is to fill your time with activities that enhance your well-being and pull you away from endless scrolling.


## Chapter 3 -  Doing Little Things

Let’s assume your screen time is now down to 3.5 to 4 hours.

Now it’s the afternoon, and it’s time to pass this part of the day by doing small, mindful activities.

Experiencing the afternoon to evening without any form of screen is essential for better sleep and falling asleep on time. This is because your brain and circadian rhythm need cues from the environment, like natural light changes, to recognize that night is approaching.

Here are some things you can do during this time:

• Take a walk

• Spend time alone to reflect

• Talk with strangers and make new connections

• Watch the sunset and enjoy the beauty of nature

• Visit a park to relax or people-watch

Do anything you enjoy that doesn’t involve a screen


## Chapter 4 - Some More Little Things

Let’s assume your screen time is now 5 hours.

Now it’s time to spend 1-2 more hours productively, without relying on your phone.

Here are some things you can do:

• Call your loved ones.

• Prepare dinner .

• Read a book to relax or learn something new

""Do anything you enjoy, as long as it doesn’t involve your phone""


Once you’ve finished your tasks for the day, place your phone in a different room and head to bed.


## Chapter 5- Creating a Game

This game will make your NoSurf or phone addiction journey more fun and rewarding.

You might be wondering, ""What kind of game?""

It’s simple: grab your notebook and write down your name.

Your Name - Aura 1.

Now, increase or decrease your ""Aura"" by completing or failing tasks mentioned earlier in this guide.

If you fail a task, decrease your Aura. If you complete it, increase your Aura. The value of points is entirely up to you. You can assign more points to tasks that you find most important or challenging.

Here’s an example:

Po*n -Free Day – +1 Aura point

Talk with Strangers – +0.5 Aura points

Go to Bed Early – +1 Aura point

Wake Up Early – +1 Aura point


Feel free to add more mechanisms to make the game more engaging and tailored to your journey!




## Ending Notes

Making your phone ""dumber"" is also a form of addiction. You download this icon pack, use that launcher, install app blockers, and so on. I’m not saying these don’t work—they can—but they won’t work the way you think.

Here’s the thing: constantly changing your phone's setup or adding new restrictions doesn’t solve the root problem. It's just another way of spending more time thinking about your phone. Eventually, it becomes part of the addiction itself. The real goal is to move away from the phone entirely, not just customize it.

Some of my recommendations

(Note: I use Samsung/Android, so I don’t know much about iOS.)

User Interface

Launcher: Niagara Launcher

Icon Pack: Letters - Minimalist Icon Pack

Greyscale 

Making your device’s display less saturated can help reduce distractions. If you're on Samsung:
Go to Settings > Screen Mode > choose Natural.

Debloating Your Device
You can use apps like Shizuku and Canta to uninstall apps like Chrome, YouTube, and the Play Store. On Samsung, your device will work fine without these apps, but don’t uninstall Google Play Services, or you won’t get notifications.

If you're interested, you can watch YouTube videos to learn more about how to debloat your phone.

Watching YouTube Without Distractions

Use the Brave browser to watch YouTube without shorts, related videos, and other distracting elements.

Instagram

I don’t recommend deleting Instagram completely. In my case, I deleted my old account and created a new one because people thought I was strange for not being on social media.

If you’re addicted to Instagram Reels, try using the No Scroll app.

For Samsung users, you can create a routine that automatically closes Instagram after 2 minutes. Here’s how:

1. Go to Settings > Modes and Routines > Routines > click + or Add.


2. In the ""If"" section, select ""App opened"", then choose Instagram.


3. In the ""Then"" section, select Advanced options, then choose ""Wait before next action"". Set the timer to 2 or 5 minutes.


4. Now, select the second option in ""Then"", choose ""Apps"", then select ""Close an app"" and choose Instagram. Save the routine.



If you don’t get it, comment below and I can share a screenshot.

Reddit
You can use Reddit without an account to avoid notifications and personalized content.

## The Real Solution

As I mentioned, there isn’t a permanent ""quick fix"" to phone addiction. The true, lasting solution is engaging in activities without your phone.

If you disagree with some points, that's okay. The important part is that you’ve recognized the issue, which is a huge step forward. Many people live trapped in the fake reality of social media, but you’re already on your way out.

Dee’s Diner, early morning, was alive with the clatter of breakfast consumption. The early bird gang—a group of bald men in denim and women in polyester, their hair light pastel shades of pink and lavender—sat around a table at the center of the restaurant, arguing over the finer points of the encroaching election:

Old Man 1: I don’t care how much carpet she munches, as long as she ain’t a Lib.

Woman with Pink Hair: I told Janice that I’m just afraid the pumpkins are going to freeze.

Old Man 2: So you want another AI crawling up your ass? Third Eye is nothing to fuck around with.

Woman with Lavender Hair: Well, my pie comes in a can. I dare you to tell the difference. Ya’ll know it’s all in the crust.

Old Man 2: Someone needs to get shit under control. Old man Vance found them camping on his back eighty…

Near the far wall, a long table held a team of young, boisterous men chowing down their Lumberjack Stacks, occasionally laughing or reaching across to offer a high five.

Alan felt old. A headache had taken up residency in his skull—and it had brought a gong and friends for background orchestra. It didn’t help that Mickey Verona was whistling a happy tune as he highlighted sections of a document on his old laptop, which, like his glasses, was held together by electrical tape.

Alan massaged his temples.

Mickey stopped his song and work long enough to impale two triangles of his pancake, logged with buttery maple syrup, and plunge them into the sunny center of an egg. The chubby man wiped a dribble from his chin and regarded Alan.

“It’s going to jeopardize your professional testimony,” said the lawyer, sipping his coffee, dull morning light glinting off his balding head.

*Clack!* Alan’s mug hit the table. He nearly stood. “Being ruled insane will destroy his life. The state will have sole custody over him. He’ll be institutionalized until he’s eighteen.”

Mickey raised his mug and, like a schoolteacher, looked skeptically over his glasses. “Being found guilty and listed on the sex offender registry will destroy his life,” he said. “He’ll never be able to go within a thousand feet of a park, a school, a movie theater, or a shopping mall. He’ll have to publicly list his address. He’ll have a special driver’s license with ‘predator’ written all over it. He’ll always be looking over his shoulder, waiting for the next internet vigilante to track him down and livestream the harassment. They’re doing it in the metaverse these days—have you heard? That shit happens, Doc. You know what they did to that guy out in California.” He shoved more pancake into his mouth and chewed while watching Alan.

Alan recalled the famous case from several years ago when a teacher in California had been convicted of having carnal relations with his underage pupil. The man had avoided a lengthy jail sentence due to a technicality, but that didn’t stop a group of pedophile hunters with big-name sponsorships from tracking him down. Pretending to be a pest control company to get inside his home, they tied him to a chair and held a virtual trial, allowing their viewers to vote. Predictably, the man was found guilty. For punishment, they put a tire over his neck, filled it with gasoline, and struck a match. To that day, it remained one of the most-watched internet events in history, and it had inspired hundreds of copycat streamers.

“Warmer upper, boys?” The buxom blonde waitress swooped in with a steaming carafe of dark coffee.

Mickey beamed. “Oh, you bet, Foxy. This coffee is mighty fine, and the hot cakes today, perfecto!” He kissed his fingertips.

Alan picked up the Valley News and held it in front of his face to hide his eye roll.

“And some for you, Dr. Smith? You sure you don’t want more than an English muffin?”

“I’m good, thank you.” He turned to the last page: horoscopes and chess moves, a crossword puzzle, and a comic. There’d been no mention of Francis and the events at the high school.

“Watcha gonna go as?” asked Foxy.

“I was thinking a vampire or a leprechaun,” said Mickey.

“I’m feeling a dark Alice in Wonderland vibe. How about the Mad Hatter as Dracula? Oh crap! I forgot table five’s hash browns!”

Alan found the courage to lower the newspaper. The lawyer’s eyes were locked on the shapely curves of the departing waitress.

“I asked her to the Halloween gala. She said yes!”

“Congratulations. I’m beside myself.”

“Come on, Doc, you ought to go. There’ll be some fine things there. I know for a fact that little red from the sheriff’s office is going. Fire down below, know what I mean? Yep, I think we should move to dismiss this afternoon. It’s not there. The evidence is just not there to go to trial. Any luck with this White Owl character?”

“I wouldn’t trust that crazy hag to be the guardian of a turnip, let alone a human child. She was nonplussed when I told her about Francis.”

“Shit. Well, there might be a workaround. I do recall a case where they got the lunch lady to testify…”

The adventure in White Owl’s cave had proven unproductive, and he highly suspected the tea she’d given him had been a sedative. He remembered everything vividly up to that point. Then there had been a story, Francis’s bedroom, and his flight down the mountain as though he were being carried by an indistinct and winged creature, pursued by murky forms through the trees, across the canal, to his car, where the self-drive, the angel of the future, had whisked him home.

The next thing he remembered was jerking wide awake at 4 AM in his own bed, still in his clothes, a dry, bitter taste in his mouth. He would have sworn it was all a dream, but when he went to make coffee—there on his kitchen table was a faded, old, blue guitar.
***

The courtroom seemed better suited for a business conference. The room was large and unassuming. A double-wide conference table with an oval hole in the center accommodated microphones, monitors, cameras, and power strips.

The midday gray of October’s final day filtered through the windows. They’d come thirty minutes before the scheduled time at the advice of Mickey, quoting his father, “Things happen early at courthouses.”

“Just so you know.” Mickey rubbed the back of his thick neck. “Judge Myers, the prosecutor Janet Bell, and I have what you might call a history.”

“What do you mean, ‘history?’” Alan asked.

“A procedural argument, really—details aren’t important. Let’s just say I’m not on anyone’s Christmas card list. Hey, you only live once, right?” He held up a chunky fist to bump. Behind him, a man stood in the doorway.

“Excuse me, gentlemen,” said the man, young and blond and fit beneath his suit jacket. He walked right up to Alan, getting in his face with his sleek AR gear. “Alan Smith, doctor of psychology.”

“This is a legal proceeding. And you are?” asked Mickey in a licit tone.

“Timothy Boothe, Senator John Taylor’s personal security. I need to scan you. It’s protocol.” He pulled aside the lapel of his jacket and produced a pen device. With a flick of his wrist, he extended it into a long wand and ran it up and down Alan’s front and back. It beeped twice at his phone.

Boothe repeated the procedure on Mickey, who puffed up his chest and said, “You want to do that to yourself?”

The young man’s healthy, enigmatic smile did not change as he retracted the wand with a snap and slipped it back into his pocket. He then opened the side of his jacket to reveal the hefty grip of a holstered weapon.

“Are we done, or you going to probe my ass like a gentleman?” said Mickey.

“My apologies, Mr. Verona.”

“Good job, you can use the internet.”

“Senator Taylor would like a quick word before everything gets complicated,” said Boothe.

“I’d say it’s already complicated.” Mickey slammed his briefcase on the table.

“All clear,” Boothe spoke to a mic hidden somewhere in his glasses.

The door opened, and a figure that had dominated the news screens during the election cycle—a tall, chiseled mountain of a man— strode in, followed by an attractive young woman, skin dark as chestnut, long platinum blonde hair done up in a tight bun, save for braids painted silver and gold in the current fashion. She wore sophisticated glasses and a skirt that stretched around her ass and across her crotch. Her blazer was open, and the two moons of her breasts were trying to rise out of her dress shirt.

“Gentlemen, I’d like to come to an out-of-court arrangement,” said Taylor.

His deep voice filled the room, making Alan’s skin tingle. Like Mickey, he had to look up into the man’s face, which was clean-shaven with dark, striking features, perfect teeth, a buzz of salt-and-pepper across his temple, and the famous white scar beneath his right eye—a torture wound from his days as a POW. For the last year, the war story had been plastered all over the news and rung dry of any political juice it contained.

“How about this?” Mickey squared his stance to match that of the powerful man. “You drop all charges against my client. You don’t have the evidence.”

“There’s CCTV footage,” said Taylor.

“Of a hug,” retorted Mickey. “And then the camera cuts out because you cut funding on education.”

“He broke the ‘No Touch’ law. And he’s male and Native, and our two governments are on the rocks at the moment.”

“So you’re going to racialize this?”

Taylor flashed a wide smile. “I have the Chief on speed dial if you’d like to talk to her. The tribe is one of my biggest clients in Montana. What with refugees and Gretas swarming in like a plague of locusts, devouring up precious resources, I don’t think she wants another scandal on her plate.”

“Is that a threat?” said Mickey. “I can bring it up to the judge.”

“No, no, not a threat. I don’t make threats, but I’ll tell you what I will do if you proceed.” He gestured with a hand larger than Paul Murphy’s to his companion. “This is Ms. Sule.”

The woman held out her hand, and Mickey shook it. “Sandra Sule. Call me Sandy. I’m the senator’s personal legal adviser. I’ll be advising Prosecutor Bell throughout the trial.”

“Of course you will,” said Mickey. “I read your profile in *Time.* You probably make more in a week than she makes in a year.”

Sandy smiled; her candy-apple-red lipstick gave her teeth a hungry glimmer. “Mickey, if you don’t mind, I like to be on a first name basis with council.”

“You can call me anything you like,” he said.

She bit her bottom lip and fingered the fringe of her shirt against the smooth skin of her breast. “As you know, Senator Taylor is engaged in high-level political affairs. He doesn’t want the media to exploit his daughter’s suffering, which they *will* do.”

“Unless you own the media,” said Mickey. “Funny enough, there wasn’t a word in the papers this morning.”

“We’re hoping there won’t be much to say about this issue,” said Sandy.

“Our justice system is what makes us a civilized nation. Besides, justice is blind, right?” When she didn’t answer, Mickey added confidently, “I believe Francis Builds A Fire will be found innocent in any court of law, based on the evidence.”

Sandy perched her shapely rear on the conference table and stared at the door where the security guard stood with his arms crossed, observing all, probably recording everything on his glasses.

“If you take this to court, we will bury you,” she said. “We will throw the book at the boy. We will have him labeled a sex offender and chemically castrated, or surgically, whichever he prefers. I’ll make sure he’s on the list for all the new pervert treatments. I’ll make sure he’s famous. We will launch a billboard campaign. We’ll pin his location on the map as a level 3 predator, so people will be able to find him in real time. Even if we lose, which we won’t, but even if we do, that boy’s life will be over.”

“That’s depraved,” Alan cut in. He couldn’t help himself. She reminded him of Becky Madison.

“That’s the law,” said Sandy.

“Your offer?” Mickey asked.

She crossed her legs, leaning back on her arms. She was looking at Tim Boothe. He was looking at her. John Taylor had somehow receded and seemed like a spectator on a stage, or a game master admiring his arena.

“Francis pleads guilty to assault.”

“Not sexual,” Mickey said quickly.

“Not sexual.”

“What’s the hook?”

“Cross Heirs, Pastor Tony’s reformatory program for troubled youth. Your client agrees to enroll until his eighteenth birthday.”

“Will I have access? Will his mental health professional and temporary guardian, Dr. Smith, be able to visit whenever he wants?”

“As an organization of faith—”

“That’s what I thought, Sandy,” said Mickey.

“He’ll receive an education. His record will be expunged.” She stood and turned to Alan. “If you give a damn about this kid, you’ll take this deal.”

“Give us a moment,” said Mickey.

“Of course.”

Mickey pulled him to the door, which Tim Boothe held open for them.

There was a nip and bite to the outside air. Dark clouds above threatened to drop snow. He needed a heavier jacket. “What the fuck is going on in there?” Alan asked.

“Listen. I think we should take that deal. She’s not lying. If we go to court, regardless of the outcome, Francis’s life is going to be forever altered, and not in a good way. Hell, I wouldn’t give him a year before the vigilante streamers start to track him down.”

And then Francis would be gone forever, and everyone could get back on with their lives.

“No, I want to see the judge. He’s innocent. You know it. I know it.”

“With all due respect, Doc, this isn’t about you.”

“Francis has a right.”

“Okay, alright.” Mickey threw up his arms. “We’ll talk to Francis.”

He followed as Mickey stomped back to the courtroom. Inside, the lights had been turned on, and a warm breeze blew out of a vent. Taylor and Sandy had moved to the far end of the table, conferencing in front of a large laptop. A plump woman in a dress that made her look like a blueberry arranged items at the head of the table.

“Hey, John,” hollered Mickey upon entry, “why the fuck you want that boy so bad?”

Taylor jerked to his feet, but Sandy had a hand on his arm. He looked at her, whispered something, and she returned a whisper in his ear. He sat, his face flushed red.

“Have you considered our offer?” asked Sandy.

“We’re going to confer with our client. We’ll need two weeks.”

“You have one.”

“Fine.” Mickey sat.

I’ve been here for a couple of months already and it's been quite lonely. I work full-time on weekdays and maybe quite busy by then. But I reply fast to texts so that wouldn't be a problem.

I have lots of time to spare on weekends and maybe we can go out and have fun - visiting random places, having good meals, and chatting over coffee or some drinks.

If there's one thing l'm pretty much excited about, it must be cooking for you at my flat. Then we get to watch movies together and enjoy our time with each other.

I love taking pictures. Once we get to know each other well, I'll show you my IG full of wonderful photos from the places I've visited. Hopefully, when we're together, my albums will also be filled by wonderful photos of our adventures around the world (Europe first, then somewhere else — been to some already and I hope to add more memories, with “you” 😉).

I prefer someone also from here in London. So I can be with you regularly and we can spend quality time. I'm not sure if I can do long distance again since I have trust issues coming from the past. But let's see if it'll work.

I'm just a simple guy, not very hard to please. If you've reached this part and you're game with everything, maybe you can send me a message and let's see where it goes?

If there’s one thing I’m proud of, I’m a very caring lad who likes to give my partner quality time. 

Read: Just in case you're wondering, I prefer a TOP, MASC guy, and preferably NON-ASIAN anymore (just a breath of fresh air from dating all sorts of people from the continent). Hope you get to respect that as I’m quite sure you have your own preference. 😁

Will wait for you! 😀

We took some time and seemed to have grown during our time apart, and issues we had before have improved. We've lived together for about 7 months now. We were raised differently in the sense that he was taught to always be cleaning, and I was raised in a messier house. Since then I've definitely improved my cleaning habits, although it seems they are still not up to his standards. I reminded him when I moved in that me improving my cleaning habits would be a learning curve and that he needs to be patient with me, since he had a small meltdown when he saw all my stuff in the living room the day I moved in.

He has been more patient with that lately, but a large issue that I ran into with him since I moved in that I haven't experienced before is him micromanaging a lot of what I do - when it comes to cleaning but also other things around the house. When I went to make coffee in a tumbler glass, he says I shouldn't do that because the glass might break. When I go to clean the cat's litter box, he critiques the way I'm doing it. When I say ""I made the bed"" and show him, which I didn't really do before I moved in, he says ""it's not the way I would have done it"" I feel like I can't win.

I expressed to him (multiple times) that his constant micromanaging bothers me, and it has decreased a lot although it still happens. I even asked him why he feels the need to do that and he said that he ""thinks he's right about most things and he knows the right way to do things"" He said it in a tone that suggested he was joking, but I really don't think he was. I really feel like he treats me like a little girl, and I expressed that to him. He agrees with me on that, and seems to know he shouldn't be doing that,

Another point of contention for us has been the repeated amount of time he tries to get me to go to the gym as much as he does. I prefer to take workout classes rather than go to the gym - the gym bores me and I like the direction a class provides. Early in our relationship, he made a comment while I was at the gym with him (I do go with him sometimes to make him happy) that he always thought that he would ""date a girl that goes to the gym all the time"" and that made me sad since it seems like I wasn't living up to his expectations although being a gym rat isn't me. It's frustrating. He's brought it up multiple times and each time I remind him that I don't love the gym like he does. A couple days ago, I said I'd go to the the gym with him and he got excited saying all the workouts we'll do together. I said I might not do all the same workouts as he does, but I'll definitely join in for a few! He got upset and quiet when I told him this. Said he knows if I go to the gym like he does, I'll get addicted to the feeling. I remind him AGAIN that I'm not interested and he should be happy I'm going with him at all. I feel like a broken record reminding him of this.

Another thing that has been bothering me is that when I say something to him, about 40% of the time he doesn't respond. After about 10 seconds, I ask ""did you hear what I said?"" and he says he did. I ask him to acknowledge me and he thinks he doesn't have to say anything because ""he heard"" but I ask him how I'd know he heard me if he doesn't acknowledge what I say....he doesn't seem to understand.

I don't know what to do. We made a couples' counseling appointment since it seems like we are fighting all the time. I feel like I've had a lot of patience with him but my patience is running low. Is this relationship salvageable? I still love him but it feels like I'm being disrespected in this relationship.

2. Spilled some coffee on them
3. wiped with wet wipes, alchohol, then wet wipes again (apparently I should not have LOL)
4. Black sploches on the wet wipes (previous polish removed because of alchohol?)
5. Learned about leather care afterwards (haven't applied anything, it's been 10 days cause im out of town, shoes looked a bit more dull and creasy when I left)
6. Learning about shoe care and its extremely complicated. I wanna keep things as cheap as possible while still doing due diligence. Western brands here in the Philippines cost a whole ton, plenty of local options but not sure how to screen what's good and bad.
7. To keep things simple, I am thinking of simply doing wet wipes in moderation > conditioner > polish, and re-do this if I ever spot the shoe is looking less  than stellar.
8. I am planning to skip leather cleaners, as I've read it is the least important part in most day-to-day cases and can be substituted by just wiping down with water.
9. With the local leather conditioner and polish I am eyeing, total cost is about $5 for both,  other options (that are locally branded) are actually cheaper like mink oil etc, so this is mid-high tier for the conditioner in terms of pricing.)
10. I would actually prefer just one product. Maybe thoughts on this?

I’ve only looked at Osaka for the ease of travel to other areas. But I’m really open to any suggestions. We love nature and quiet and we don’t need to be in a city. Being within 45 minutes to a city by public transport is ok. 

Also not opposed to renting a car. We have international driving permits.

Being able to sleep well and be comfortable in the location we chose is high on my list. 

We are also ok with more than day trips elsewhere. 

1-2 nights stay in other places within the month is within the budget to get a good well rounded Japan trip.

TLDR: I planned a trip for us and when husband did not like it and kept complaining about everything I drove him home and continued the trip myself. AITA?

A bit of background on our relationship (context here is important), I 31F am the sole provider for my husband (30M) and I. It has been this way for roughly 8 years and I fully pay for any vacation/entertainment/travel that we plan.

About 4 weeks ago I realized I had Bonvoy points that needed to be used before EOY or they would expire so we planned a mini getaway in a city nearby. We normally pick the hotel together and I usually do most of the planning around the activities he wants to do (he's a bit more picky, I am more fluid/flexible and can adjust). This time it was a bit different since the trip was centered around what **I** wanted to do which was: xmas-related stuff. I'm not huge on Christmas but this past year I just really ""felt the spirit"" and the hotel I picked is specifically in an area where there is a lot of xmas-type festivities - Xmas decor, shopping centers, coffee shops, restaurants, bars. I wanted to do some xmas shopping and just have a weekend of relaxing while being ""surrounded by xmas."" I showed him the hotel and told him we can stay at our usual place if he did not want to do that or did not like the area/idea. He wasn't too excited but was open to trying something different.

For about a week leading up to the trip I kept gushing about how excited I was to go and how much I was really looking forward to a stress-free weekend filled with xmas. I specifically said ""I can't wait to be in my own little xmas movie"" because that's quite literally what this place is, nothing but shopping/restaurants/xmas decor.

The day we leave for the trip it is raining. I drove us. There is a lot of traffic. When we finally get to the restaurant he picked (I told him to pick a place for dinner since I picked the hotel) we were both hungry and it was a 1-hour wait. I could've easily been irritable (I can be hangry at times when I start getting a headache) but I just wanted to have a good ""stress-free"" vacation so I did my best to be positive in the situation. We got a beer as we waited for dinner, had a good dinner and everything was fine as we headed to the hotel. As we start driving through the stores and restaurants to get to the hotel his mood kind of changes and I can't remember exactly what he said but something along the lines of ""this is it?"". We check into the hotel and are headed up to the room as he starts complaining about *everything* (bar is too small, funny smell in the elevator, does not like bathroom setup in our room, etc.). 

I try to ignore it and ask if he wants to grab a drink, its about 10pm and some restaurants and bars are still open, I mostly wanted to walk around and look at the xmas lights but was happy to just go grab a drink. He said no, he was tired and wanted to got to bed. I insisted (in hindsight, I should've just gone to bed) simply because I was **excited** to be there and when he kept saying no I was going to just go by myself (its a very safe area). Once he realized I wasn't budging he agreed to go with me but everything about the experience was miserable. He did not talk to me on the walk to the restaurant/bar, hardly talked to me once we got there and when I tried making conversation he'd just give me short answers. I quickly finished my beer and we left, I was fighting tears on the walk back to the hotel. I just kept thinking about how stressful the drive was and he quite literally could not give a shit or let me have this small bit of happiness that I was obviously very excited for. Once we got back to the hotel he went straight to bed and I wanted to watch tv, he told me I could not watch tv since he was going to bed at which point I kind of just flipped. I felt crushed. Why was he being so ugly to me? I try not to have a selfish perspective but I was thinking *I can't watch tv in this room I booked for us??.* For the record, I've watched tv while he slept multiple times before, this time it felt like he was being petty which is part of why I responded so poorly.

After that I went to the bar downstairs and had another beer, I just did not want to be around him in that moment. Afterward I went upstairs to shower and get ready for bed. As I got ready for bed I practically acted like he wasn't there (I left the light off but made a lot of noise) as I was unpacking my things and prepping for bed. By the time I laid down I could tell we were both upset and I said ""don't worry, we are leaving tomorrow.""

This is where I may be the AH. When I work up the next morning he wasn't in the room and I was still feeling crushed since it felt like he basically took a giant shit on the happy xmas weekend I planned but still wanted to make the most of it so I woke up thinking ""why the hell should **I** leave?"" Since he was not in the room I texted him to tell him I'd take him home whenever he was ready. We drove home in silence and I dropped him off, cutting ""his"" vacation short and continuing ""mine"". 

When we finally talked about it, he claimed I cut his vacation short without even asking him and he was, apparently, having a great morning and wanting to stay before I texted him to tell him I was taking him back but the problem is, **he never told me any of this** in the moment and never tried to communicate any of this to me at the hotel because ""I'd already made the decision to take him home"". Like what??? I feel insane so I figured I'd ask here. AITAH? I'm open to all feedback and being wrong, I'm just confused.",0,1736008279.0,AITAH,11,0.5,False
1hti3js,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coconaad/comments/1hti3js/story_time_how_i_met_a_redditor_for_the_first/,Story time: How I met a Redditor for the first time in my life through Coconaad..,"Precisely 1 month ago, I lost a dear friend. Not in the literal sense, but in the way words and miscommunication created a gap too wide to cross. It broke me. I felt at fault for overreacting, yet I couldn’t stop questioning why it happened. Lost, sad, and restless, I went on a long walk, which eventually led to a heartfelt post on[ Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coconaad/comments/1h6lnyi/a_walk_at_night_that_changed_my_perspective/).

That post gained traction unexpectedly - I don't know why but probably people could see my view of the world through my words . Comments poured in, along with over a dozen DMs. Strangers shared their own stories—some of heartbreak, others of grief but most importantly, loneliness. A few were isolated in foreign lands, aching to be with loved ones. The common thread was how people drift apart, often amplified by a sense of regret that one of them could have act differently. 

One message struck me deeply, a Redditor confessed they were so broken that even kindness felt like a knife cutting through them because it reminded them of the pain they were trying to escape. The Redditor soon enough deleted the user - If you are reading this - please be safe and whatever you are going through shall pass. Not everyone is a jerk, not everyone is out to hurt.

Among the others who reached out to me, one stood out. She was incredibly empathetic, having recently endured something similar to my experience - the loss of a dear friend. Our connection felt almost surreal. It was almost like my lost friend was somehow reaching out to help me heal. What began as a casual DM turned into long chats every evening. We spoke of life, our struggles, our mental health issues, work, pains, family and perhaps some of our deepest secrets - but the anonymity of Reddit gave a sense of safety. We choose to discuss our vulnerabilities, those odd traumatic life experiences and many others. 

In many ways, she was my opposite:  

\- I was shy but she wasn’t.  

\- I was an introvert but she made me spill my heart.  

\- I was lost but she wasn’t.

We both had our owns struggles though. 

At one point, I wondered if she was even real. Was this some coping mechanism my mind had conjured up? Was I losing my mind, I wondered.  

Reddit turned into Telegram. Telegram turned into WhatsApp. And finally we shared our numbers. Soon enough, we were talking. I worried I might be reading too much into her kindness, falling for someone just because they cared. I wasn’t used to people setting aside time for me, let alone strangers. I wasn't used to people showing this level of a trust. 

Finally, we decided to meet.  

She lived in another city, so I traveled to see her for Christmas. Plans were made, but I kept my expectations low. I braced myself for the possibility of sitting alone at a Starbucks, wondering where I went wrong. I worried of my Reddit anonymity..

On the Saturday afternoon right before Christmas, I walked into Starbucks, messaging her on Telegram to say I had arrived. I scanned the room but didn’t see anyone matching her description. My heart sank. The “Typing…” indicator popped up, and my anxiety spiked. She replied: “Come on, you can figure this out.”

A thousand doubts raced through my mind. Was I being played? Was I just naive?  

And then, I saw her. Sitting at a corner table, facing the wall, away from the crowd. I could hear my heart beat faster.. 

I tapped her on the shoulder and asked softly, “Is that you?” and I was greeted by the most expressive eyes I have ever seen. I had startled her but her eyes lit up with a joyful glee.  

It felt unreal. Sitting across from her, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I could be dreaming. She noticed my confusion and asked, “What?” - I just smiled.  I asked if I could touch her hand to be sure if she was real and she giggled. 

We ordered coffee and talked about everything under the sun. Hours passed like minutes or did it? We wandered through some shops - she wanted to buy a book and I like to read books. Talking and laughing until it was time for her to leave. As we parted that day, we promised to meet again.  

The next day, we did. But she seemed different—distracted, tired. She had a headache but nothing a strong espresso couldn't solve - so she said, but little did we know that she was falling ill. Still, we spent time together, sipping coffee, chatting, and walking around. Saying goodbye that day was harder because neither of us knew if or when we’d meet again. We shook hands but refused to leave, much to the disdain of the Uber that was waiting. Pinched her cheeks and I complained about her makeup that got my hands dirty, she played along squeezed my hands but we knew it was our way of saying goodbye. I stood there waving until her car disappeared in the sea of other until I could faintly see her looking back and waving..

I left the city with a hope that I’d see her again someday. We kept in touch, but life got in the way, people got in the way. She was busy with work and dealing with issues back home. I had my own struggles. Some days, I worried I was burdening her with my problems because I had no one else to turn to.  

She suggested therapy. I agreed but never followed through. New Year came and went. I held on to the hope of meeting her again—if she wanted to.  But I didn’t know if she could. 

But here’s what I do know. When I was at my lowest, she was there. A stranger who listened without judgment, without blame, gently nudging me towards healing. She gave me her time and kindness when I needed it most.  She accepted me for what I was - unconventional and an outcast. She made me feel like a child, and I let go off my inhibitions because I felt certain that I would not to be taken advantage of.  

I don’t know if we’ll ever meet again but I sure hope we do. We have only know each other for 30 days but we vibed like we have known each other for an eternity, met under the strangest of the circumstances - this couldn't be coincidence. A truly cherished friend I wish I had gotten to know earlier..  
  
But to her- Thank you for that DM which started it all. Thank you for the times you made me laugh. Thank you for those precious moments that you made me feel alive. Thank you for helping me shed my inhibitions. Thank you for everything - until we meet again.

And to all dear cocos, the whole wide world is full of people - most of them with a good heart. If you can lighten up someone's life, do so if you get an opportunity. There is nothing more valuable than your time that you can offer to some one but do so wisely to anyone who knows its value.

And I hope 2025 offers all of us life experiences that deeply and positively impact your existence... 

So until the next story - signing off..

1hti1wa,https://www.reddit.com/r/CostaRicaTravel/comments/1hti1wa/2_week_budget_friendly_itinerary_costa_rica/,2 week budget friendly itinerary - Costa Rica ,"Total cost was cca 1000-1200$/pp excluding flights.

Hello, me and my boyfriend spent 2 weeks in this beautiful country. We are in our mid 20s. We were mostly using local buses and stayed in budged friendly but nice accomodations (rooms with a bathroom and shared kitchen) Here is our itinerary and some tips in case you find it helpful.

General tips:

- it is pricier than you think
- have some colones (if you are trying to transfer by public transport and eat at local places/ buy from locas, you will need to have colones on you, dollars can only get you so far in turistic places, for example tours, accomodation etc. can be paid in dolars) - locals are happier to recieve colones
- eat at sodas (will cost you 3000-5000 (6-10$) per meal, wich is less than half of what restaurants charge)
- when waiting for a bus ask around if you are at the right station, because some info online might be outdated and buses tend to leave from smaller stations (or just signs) around town
- bus rides take longer than you expect
- buy food that locals eat - it is significatly cheaper than imported food (rice, beans, plantanas, bell peppers, bananas, pineapple ect) 
- transfer days take at least half of the day if not a full day  -> wake up early
- we took Holafy esim and had unlimited internet for ~40$ which was very helful but had some bad signal spots during our trip
- Uber only works in big cities
- you will get upcharged

DAY 1 
- arrived to the SJO airport in the evening. Got a ride with some people from the plane to Alajuela where we stayed for cca 30$.

DAY 2 - transfer to la fortuna

got a bus at cca 9 am to San Ramon (bus levaes from North station, and from San Ramon to La Fortuna. Read post for more info on this bus. Had nice coffe in SR at Museo de cafe.

Arrived to La Fortuna - stayed at La Petit Hotel (45$/night) (nice budget rooms, has a pool, kitchen and a nice garden).

Went for a walk, saw vulcano that emerged out of the clouds, had dinner at soda Vista al Cerro Chato - one of the best sodas we ate at, returned twice.

DAY 3 - Waterfall (20$) and Cerro Chato hike (15$)

Waterfall is overpriced but nice, we couldn't swim because of the heavy rains. 

Cerro Chato hike was very dificult, requires good fitness and some climbing capabilities, you will be wet and dirty if it rains, but the rain forest around you is something special. Much more prestine than any of the natural parks.

DAY 4 - El Choyn and transfer to Monteverde (28$)

We woke up early and headed to El Choyn (thermal river - the free one) by Uber (5-7$ one way). Because of the early hour we were there alone, but the locals and tourists stared appearing after 8am. Amazing experience. Saw sloths in the trees above the river.

Took a Jeep-boat-Jeep (28$) tranfer to monteverde (nice scenic ride with bus, roads are in bad condition) - bus around the lake would be cheaper but muuuuch longer and even thir ride was very long.

Stayed at El Nido hostel (40$/nigt) - great staff, very helpful with your plans, nice rooms. Cooked eggs for our christmas dinner.

DAY 5 - Monteverde cloud forest (26$/pp)

Took a local bus to the visitor center, bought tickets, hiked to the entrance, hiked the whole park, saw monkies, tiny wild bores, collibris, some insects and birds. A bit pricy but nice, what can you do.
Ate at Soda Shangri-La not the cleanest place, but the food was ok.

DAY 6 - transfer to Quepos

Took the 4:20 bus from Monteverde to Puntarenas (you can buy tickets online here: https://www.transmonteverde.com/ )

Wanted to catch the 7am bus from Puntarenas to Quepos (Manuel Antonio) but missed it, so we had to go on the 9 am one. Puntarenas is really not a pleasant town so not worth a stop unless you have to. The bus to Quepos took much longer than anticipated. 

In the afternoon we went to the Manuel Antonio beach by public bus that leaves quepos bus station every 15-30 min, (380¢). We sadly couldn't eneter the park, because the tickets were sold out many days in advance, but spent the afternoon on the becah next to the park.
Ate at Soda Sanchez - very nice place and tasty food for somewhat cheap (whatever cheap means in CR)

DAY 7 - Quepos - Uvita

Next morning we woke up early and headed to Biensanz beach (again the public bus and a hike). Was very nice until umbrellas and sunbeds started to appear all around us.

Later we took a bus (supposed time 11:30) from Quepos to Uvita which was 2h late :( so we spent some time at the bus station eating delicious empanadas from the bakery in the corner of the station.

DAY 8 - Uvita
 Uvita is very spread out so a bit hard to walk around, but we managed. I would recommend renting a bicycle. It was raining the whole day - went to see the beach, hanged in the Koru Butique hostel (50$/night) and cooked some meals.

DAY 9 - Uvita - free swimming spot and waterfall
found it on google maps, very nice, saw tucans, many buterflies and birds.
Ate at a cute soda inside a football place/school in Uvita.

DAY 10 - through San Isidro (loved this town and the landscape around it), a coffe tour, to san Jose

wanted to go to hike Chirripo in one day (3800m) (20$/pp for park entry and 80$ for hotel Uran) but the forecast was rain and thunderstorms so we abondoned this plan. Took a 6 am bus from Uvita to San Isidro (Perez Zeledon) (cca 2000¢) and then the bus to San Jose (10$ bought online - MUSOC company) this bus ride was something special - beautiful views, exited in Cartago to do a bio coffee farm tour at Cafe Cristina (tours mon-sat, 9am and 2pm, 25$/pp) 
 
arrived to SJO in the evening, hostel Caneo Living for NYE.

DAY 11&12 - SJO to Puerto Viejo

Took the 6am bus to PV on 1st of Jan, spent last two days there, rented bikes for less than 8$/day, had some beach time. Stayed at a bit nicer Casa Eden (70$/night).
Cahuita national park 5$ (best value/money out of all parks)

Loved PV much more than the west coast. It is less americanised and people are nicer.

DAY 13 - PV to SJO

Morning beach time, lunch, Puerto Vijeo to SJO by 1pm bus, headed to Alajuela (airport).

1hti1a4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Synchronicities/comments/1hti1a4/the_craziest_synchronicity_of_my_life_did_i_mess/,The craziest synchronicity of my life… did I mess it up? ,"So my ex broke up with me about 10months ago, it was a miscommunication but she was going through a divorce at the time so I gave her space but in retrospect I think she was looking for support - and then I got a bit clingy and ended up getting blocked. 

The break up was really though on me and being blocked without definitive closure was particularly bad and helped me recognise my abandonment wounds and inner child work for the first time. I focused on my self but she’s always been on my mind, in particular focusing on low self esteem, an issue I’ve had my entire life. Thought I was making good progress and was really excited for the future again before the holidays. 

I went for a walk on a beach just after Christmas, it’s nearby her town which I haven’t been to much since our breakup. I was convinced she wouldn’t be around, thinking she would be back home for the holidays. 

I went to the most obscure, quite part of the beach. But off in the distance I could see a couple - it looked like an early date. They were quite far but I immediately thought it was her, I’ve not got the best eye sight. They started walking back and we passed fairly close by but at the point where I could confirm whether it was 100% her, I couldn’t bring myself to look, I was partly in shock and I don’t think if I wanted to know if it was her for sure. I did keep looking back once they passed, I became more convinced it was her, rationally I kept saying impossible. As I’ve sat with it I’ve become more convinced. 

Always had that part of my brain that would doubt synchronicities and manifestations. This is probably the biggest one of my life, it was a last minute decision that I went to that beach, I got held up in traffic, problem getting coffee all led to the perfect timing. Had I been less than 5mins earlier, I would have been walking in front of them and would have never noticed, had I been less than 5mins later they would have passed by the path that I entered the beach and I would have never seen them…

This has led to the worst emotional experience of my life, them abandonment wounds, blown wide open. I couldn’t function for days, still very much struggling tbh. 

I think there’s always been residual hope there for me considering her divorce and how she might reach out or unblock once that was over. Over the 10 months I’ve had some dreams about her and in particular situations where I seen her with someone else - in the dream I confidently approach and win her back but that’s the complete opposite of what happened here. 

Part of me thinks this was necessary for me to recognise that I’ve not put enough work into my self concept and obviously have some work to do, particularly around self esteem. The other part thinks the pain is from me not acting on the opportunity to talk to her - it feels well and truly over now. Could I have ruined the synchronicity? 

Feels like I’m in a battle with myself at the moment. Hope people find this interesting. It would be interesting if anyone has a perspective on whether I messed this opportunity up.  ",2,1736008087.0,Synchronicities,0,1.0,False

My doctor gave me a treatment to follow for a week, and I have to check with him again if it doesn't go away - but scrolling here I've mostly only read people that learnt to live with it and I am dead scared of it not going away or worsening.

I am 18, and I am pretty sure that this have been cause by my excessive music listening and going to concerts, but it already drives me insane to possibly have to give up on that, or deal with it differently as music is my main hobby.

I also deal with mental health issues, and I have Stetraline prescribed - my doctor told me to first go with the tinnitus treatment before Setraline, and I read on here that it made someone's tinnitus worse, and I don't want to just try it and find out. Do I also have to give up on alcohol, tobacco and coffee, my headphones or vinyls?

It already makes it very hard to sleep, on top of the anxiety and overthinking, it gives me massive headaches and I am exhausted. I can't deal with university with no sleep and a worsening mental health as it already takes a huge toll on me - I am dead scared but I try to remain hopeful that it'll go away.

Any advices or positivity on the situation would be much appreciated, cheers x",1,1736007990.0,TinnitusTalk,4,1.0,False

Eight days was an organized tour and is NOT in this graphic. Only the part Sydney-Adelaide. It does also NOT include the flights. So if you book a flight Sydney-Melbourne like we did, it‘s on top.  
  
- 20 days/19 nights of travel all inc for two people  
- midsized budget. We ate out everyday while in Sydney/Melbourne/Adelaide and cooked our own food an all campgrounds. We did not save money regarding food: ah there is a fancy croissant place in Melbourne, let‘s buy five things and pay 27$. Thats us, just as eat rice with beans while camping.  
- we stayed in midrange airbnb‘s or at a friends place while in a city.  
  
our route: Sydney 6 nights, Melbourne 4 nights, Torquay 1 night, Otways Bimbi 1 night (should have been more!), Otways Forrest 2 nights, Grampians Halls Gap 2 nights, Port Willinga 2 nights, Adelaide 1 night
  
my take budgetwise: it was about as expensive as expected and totally worth every penny. Eating out wasn‘t cheap, but we rather ate great food and paid 18$ than pay 8$ and the ramen is ‚meh‘. Or ate at Panda Hotpot Melbourne which did cost a whopping 170$ for two people. Well, yolo… (and worth it!).  
  
You can save A LOT of money when staying in hostels and cook for yourself 80% of your trip. Which we did neither. Renting a campervan is expensive, the campgrounds aren‘t cheap either. I don‘t think you save money camping over staying in hostels, unless you travel as bigger group and sleep in tents.

Things have been extremely stressful and rough for the past year and some change, dating back to our failed marriage therapy. To be honest, I should have left then but was on the fence about what I wanted to do following the obvious fork in the road. We have 4 children and over the past year it has become clear as day he has no intentions to work on himself. He lost his job and decided to never get another one again (21 months now without even so much as an application put in.) The reason for his not looking is because he says “his wife left him and cut off all forms of intimacy/sex” when I started going to therapy to heal some of my childhood trauma and traumatic events that happened to me. Fast forward to today, I am still in therapy working on myself and he is not. No job, not in therapy, drinking, and just overall depressed beyond recognition. Meanwhile I am in grad school, working full time and caring for our 4 children.

Oct 2024 I told him I couldn’t take it anymore and we needed to get a divorce. It was not healthy for the kids to be witnessing the relationship dynamic that we had been living in for 1 + year. I know things take time but I needed to be away from him but know neither of us can legally ask one another to leave the house. I asked for some space from him in the bedroom. In October 2024, his idea of space was put a mattress down on the floor in the living room. Mind you, We have an entire in law unit in our home downstairs that isn’t rented or occupied (used as storage.) In early December, I decided it wasn’t enough space so I started moving myself down stairs. I cleaned it up and put a bed, a desk, and a chair down there. End of Dec I filed for divorce. I plan to reside down there and only occupy the main part of the home while caring for the children. This is the plan until we go before the mediator to decide what happens with custody/living arrangements/assets, etc. Well apparently this amount of space between us threatens him. 

Since I have been downstairs he has picked a fight with me over every little thing in regards to me being down there. He has said I’ve abandoned our family (not true, I’m still caring for our kids the same way and they still have an access point to come down to be with me whenever they want.) He says I am ruining the kids lives and this is not what’s best for anyone. Says I’m crazy and psycho and need to get it together. I moved a small 4x4 ikea organizer down, that had been living in our closet upstairs holding my things, that I bought a few years back. He said I need to stop moving stuff and wait to see a judge. I have not confiscated or made claim to anything. Literally just put it down there so I didn’t have to put my phone charger and water cup on a cardboard box. I decided to start having my morning coffee downstairs as well instead of upstairs in the living room where he has coffee because I realized it was becoming a window of opportunity to fight with me before the kids woke up. He then picked a fight and said “how dare I take up a common space in the house and turn it into my own little apartment!” I stated “we are separated now and heading for divorce so I’m not sure what he expects will happen going forward.” 

Since I’ve been sleeping and spending time in the downstairs unit I realize I have a newfound sense of peace. I’m sleeping better and overall I feel better. I feel like I am finally truly on my path to healing and becoming the best version of myself. And in turn, it feels like that’s going to be extremely beneficial for my kids. But, my STBX is extremely threatened by my inner peace. Every step I make to distance myself further, I notice him become trigger and lash out to fight. Why? Our marriage is over and the time to save it has passed. We both know this so I’m not sure why he is so hard pressed to continue to fighting within.? ",1,1736007809.0,Divorce,1,0.67,False

They're drinking their coffees, chat, have a good time... This is not not a joke, that's just what happens when people aren't being dicks to each other.""

Since religion is basically a set of rules and punishments against not following them, I can't imagine myself following one without necessarily being dick to people who don't. If I have access to special knowledge that will bring me to heaven or some of its non Christian equivalents, I would probably feel special privilege to force it upon others.

I suppose that's what seemingly endless religious conflicts were all about in the past. They largely ended only when reason won over religion and religious people had no choice but to be forced to stop following parts of their scripture that would be illegal today, which is why religious freedom exists in many countries today.

Of course, overwhelming majority of atheists are beyond that shit and don't nor did ever force atheism on anyone and for that reason, I think that religious tolerance is logically mostly atheist thing.",8,1736007729.0,atheism,4,0.79,False

Sorry for the incoming word vomit, im just quite confused and frankly need to spew it out somewhere. I also apologise for the huge wall of text.

I, (18m) live in Australia with my mum and dad (late 40s) my uncle (late 30s) and my younger sibling (16nb). Im moving out in a few weeks for university and to start life with my partner and other obvious reasons. Im transgender FTM and the eldest kid, so alot of this stuff can be seen as ""eldest daughter syndrome"" that hasnt gone away with my transition.

My mum and dad have been at eachothers throats for a few years now,

My mum is an alcoholic who picks fights frequently with different family members, e.g. she was upset with me once saying i lied to her about drinking a cup of coffee she had bought me (i drank half the cup and so said that i had drunk it). She tends to lack self awareness and ignores boundaries unless you fight her back on it (im spineless and try to empathise with her to attempt to fix things) these include entering my room at night and waking me up at 2 or 3am solely because she is bored, shooting me with a salt gun (its used to kill flies and small insects and causes no bodily harm, just a sting and red mark) despite me cowering in a corner saying to stop it, telling me im not allowed to delete life360 when i leave and saying she will let herself into my home when i move and rearrange things. She can become a very angry and controlling woman when she is drinking and tends to pick on you for anything no matter how minor to entertain herself(?). She had an awful childhood from what ive heard, her bio father abandoned her and her teenage mum at birth and they were in and out of womens homes and friends houses. When my uncles were born later on she was a surrogate nanny, expected to take care of her baby brothers and of course being the 80s in Australia, my nan and her husband were quite physically abusive to my mum. I cant help but feel immense sympathy for her. She loves the concept of family but her bio dads family has rejected her (and me by extension) and her mum and non bio dads family is mostly dead or estranged. (Traditional aussie bogans so most have died as a result of alchohol and smoking abuse) and now the family she created is separating.

My dad doesnt drink often and doesnt get drunk around my sibling and i. Ive never seen him ""get loose"". His firm but fair, not a classic ""dad"" really, he was a skater and major leftist during his teens and 20s, stoner, etc. He more centrist now and usually spends his time working as a tradesman to keep the family afloat financially. We're not well off but not lower class. We've narrowly avoided homelesses a couple times due to the Australian cost of living crisis (we rent). He used to be a stay at home dad when i was a kid, and truly i could be biased towards him given he was the prominent family figure in my childhood. The roles were kinda swapped as a kid. My mum was the breadwinner and wore the pants and my dad was the stay at home dad who raised me and my sibling and did household work. He had to get a job later on in my life to keep us afloat. My mums alchohol and my parents cigarettes costs do bog us down quite a bit and the alchoholism only started when i was a preteen. My dad had a pretty normal childhood, my pop was a veitnam vet so my dad lived on the bases my pop was stationed at.

My uncle is my mums youngest brother and has been in and out of jail, he tends to get in trouble alot and is very bitter about a messy divorce where he doesnt have custody of his kids, he has lived with us since he got out of jail last, 3 or 4 years ago and of course, drinks until hes black out drunk each and every night. Him and my mum tend to enable eachother with their alchoholism. And like my mum, my uncle can get quite narcissistic and mean when hes drunk. He likes to bring me and my achievements down such as recently when i told him i got into uni- i was told promptly that ""anyone can get into uni"". My uncle was expelled from primary school and kept getting expelled up until he was simply asked to leave by the time he was in high school and works as a tradie.

My younger sibling is autistic and has had alot of struggles growning up. I love them deeply and im trying my hardest to keep them afloat amongst everything. They inherited my mums anger and are quite the stubborn kid. From a young age i was always told as the eldest i had to take care of my sibling which i did, i tried helping with homework, i shared my things and i was if there was a problem- i had to help them with it. With undiagnosed autism they were quite violent in primary school and they often would get into trouble. I would have classmates and even teachers come up to me in the playground and tell me that my sibling had gotten into trouble for xy and z. Sometimes at home they would get violent as well, usually taking it out on me via chasing me with a knife and trying to gouge my eye out one time. Later on i tended to be pushed to parent my sibling, i had dug out a path for myself without much help from mum and dad and was expected to lead my sibling through the path i had carved. Of course i resented them for a while for this, buf that resentment was misplaced. They're were a kid and neither of us had control of the situation and i recognised that. Of course now im still expected to help alot with things i had to do alone. If i wanted to go somewhere, i had to figure out public transport myself and take it. Now my sibling is either driven or i have to help them with the transport- organise bus routes and a rough itinerary, etc. Again, they arent at fault at all for this and frankly i love them. Theyve had a rough time with mental health, They're on ndis now and had a scary period where they had an eating disorder and were in and out of a psych ward which imo only worsened their mental illness.
 When i was struggling with long term and severe depression and suicidal tendancies as a young teen i was told it was hormonal and i had to fight tooth and nail for therapy and often organised it myself so this all came as a bit of a shock.

 Im always worried about their health and of course theyre in the rebellious teenage phase where theyre experimenting with substances.

Over the years ive been kind of used as the family glue. My mum and my sibling hate eachother and my parents are at eachothers throat constantly. They fight frrquently and they have started to happen directly infront of me while i am in the room with them and Ive been woken up by their fights very often now and they can stem from the most obscure and minor places. My mum uses me frequently as her therapist (she refuses to see one). She vents to me about her marriage, her family, my sibling, etc and i try to comfort her. My sibling for a while only trusted me with anything and refused to speak to my parents so i was used as the middle man between the two parties. My dad closes himself off and i try mediating between him and mum to try and solve their issues.

 My moving out has of course caused an intense rift. My mum frequently clings to me asking ""why i have to leave her"" and that she'll be left with ""them"" referring to the other household members, also saying she will move down with me. My sibling has said nothing but they have started coming into my room more often, wanting to play games with me and other things and my dad has admitted hes worried about me taking such a big step. Its obvious a divorce is coming. Without me trying to hold everyone together its going to break apart and honestly, i feel terribly guilty about it.

Im worried about my sibling and how they'll be alone while my parents inevitably fight more and more, im worried they'll keep more things to themselves and will think ive abandoned them.

Im also worried about my parents, i dont want to say its pity but im worried for the outcome for my mother. She doesnt have friends and not alot of family besides her brothers. Of course in the event of separation my sibling wouldnt go with her and i dont believe theyd willingly contact her. Which leaves her last ""lifeline"" as me, which i dont know if i can do. She is my mother and i feel terrible for her but im moving away partially because of the dysfunction she has strongly attributed to. I feel horrible for leaving her alone and honestly i have no clue what to do anymore. She isnt well mentally and im not sure how leaving her alone would go, but i know bringing her with me could very well drag me down to her level. I feel absolutely disgusting that there's not that feeling of love for her, i care for her and i feel sympathy but theres not the overwhelming love i see people have for their mothers. It feels horrible to admit and i feel ive failed as a son.

Of course im not a perfect person and theres the average concerns a kid has when faced with the potential of their parents separating like how i dont want to see my parents date new people or if my father chooses to have new kids.

Overall though im just, miserable trying to deal with this, my partner has been beyond supportive with this whole thing and i cant be thankful enough. Im just so confused and honestly i feel like a kid again in the worst way possible. I have no clue how to deal with any of this and all i want is to make sure everyones happy.",1,1736007614.0,FamilyIssues,0,0.99,False

The Technivorm Moccamaster 79112 KBT Coffee Brewer, a 40 oz polished silver marvel, promises premium pour-over perfection.  But does it deliver? This in-depth review explores its features, performance, and user experience to help discerning coffee enthusiasts decide if it's the right investment for their home kitchen.

<h2>Unpacking the Moccamaster KBT: A Legacy of Quality</h2>

Technivorm Moccamasters have long held a revered position among coffee aficionados. Known for their robust build, precise engineering, and consistent brewing performance, they represent a significant investment in the pursuit of the perfect cup. The 79112 KBT model, with its gleaming polished silver finish and 40 oz capacity, embodies this legacy while offering a stylish addition to any countertop.  This model specifically targets those seeking a higher brewing capacity than some other Moccamaster models.

<h2>Key Features: Precision Brewing at its Finest</h2>

The Moccamaster KBT's appeal lies in its meticulous design, focusing on precise temperature control and efficient brewing. Let's delve into the key features driving its reputation:

<h3>Precise Temperature Control: The Secret to Flavor Extraction</h3>

The heart of the Moccamaster KBT's brewing prowess lies in its copper heating element.  This element ensures the water consistently reaches the optimal brewing temperature of 195°-205°F (90°-96°C), a critical factor in extracting the full spectrum of flavors from your coffee beans. This precise temperature control is a hallmark of Moccamaster brewers and is often cited as a key differentiator from other coffee makers.  The automatic shutoff when the reservoir is empty adds a layer of safety and convenience.

<h3>Rapid Brewing and Manual Control: Efficiency Meets Customization</h3>

Brewing a full 40 oz pot takes only 4-6 minutes, a testament to the brewer's efficiency.  The manual stop-drip feature provides further control, allowing you to pause the brewing process if needed, or even adjust the strength of your brew by slightly altering the brewing time. This level of control is invaluable for experienced baristas who appreciate fine-tuning their brewing process.

<h3>Thermal Carafe: Keeping Your Coffee Hot and Ready</h3>

The double-walled, vacuum-insulated stainless steel carafe is designed to keep your coffee hot for up to an hour.  This is a significant advantage over glass carafes, which often lose heat quickly.  Preheating the carafe with hot water before brewing further enhances its heat retention capabilities, ensuring consistently warm coffee throughout your brewing session.  The included brew-through lid and travel lid add versatility, making it convenient for both at-home and on-the-go coffee enjoyment.

<h3>Pour-Over Style Brewing: Mimicking the Art of Manual Pour Over</h3>

The Moccamaster KBT's design cleverly mimics the principles of manual pour-over brewing.  The cone-shaped brew basket and the 9-hole spray arm ensure even saturation of the coffee grounds, leading to a more balanced and nuanced cup of coffee. This method, combined with the precise temperature control, contributes significantly to the superior flavor extraction.

<h2>Design and Build: A Blend of Aesthetics and Durability</h2>

The Moccamaster KBT isn't just about function; it's about style and durability.

<h3>Premium Materials and Craftsmanship: Built to Last</h3>

The machined aluminum housing is not only visually appealing but also contributes to the brewer's robust construction.  Hand-built components and the use of BPA-free plastics further underscore Moccamaster's commitment to quality and safety. This commitment to quality is reflected in the brewer's long lifespan and reliability.

<h3>Dimensions and Weight: A Practical Consideration</h3>

With dimensions of 11.5"""" L x 6.75"""" W x 15.25"""" H and a weight of 6.5 lbs, the Moccamaster KBT is substantial but not overly bulky. It's a statement piece that commands attention on the countertop without overwhelming the space.

<h3>Certifications and Standards: Meeting the Highest Quality Benchmarks</h3>

The brewer boasts Specialty Coffee Association (SCA) certification, signifying its adherence to the strict Golden Cup quality guidelines. This certification assures coffee enthusiasts that the Moccamaster KBT meets the highest standards for consistent brewing performance and superior coffee quality.

<h2>Performance and User Experience: Brewing Excellence in Practice</h2>

The Moccamaster KBT's performance consistently receives high praise.

<h3>Exceptional Brewing Performance: A Consistently Delicious Cup</h3>

The combination of precise temperature control, even saturation, and the efficient brewing process results in consistently high-quality coffee with optimal flavor extraction.  User feedback consistently highlights the rich, nuanced flavor profiles achieved with this brewer.

<h3>User Control and Customization: Tailoring Your Brew to Perfection</h3>

The manual drip-stop allows for precise control over the brewing process, enabling customization of the coffee strength to individual preferences. This feature is particularly appreciated by coffee enthusiasts who enjoy experimenting with different brewing techniques and bean varieties.

<h3>Thermal Carafe Efficiency: Maximizing Heat Retention</h3>

While the carafe excels at heat retention, preheating it with hot water before brewing significantly extends the time your coffee remains at its optimal temperature. This simple tip maximizes the benefits of the vacuum-insulated design.


<h2>Addressing User Feedback: Minor Quirks and Considerations</h2>

While the Moccamaster KBT receives overwhelmingly positive reviews, some users have noted minor issues:

<h3>Uneven Extraction: Importance of Proper Grinding and Technique</h3>

Some users report occasional uneven flavor extraction, often linked to inconsistent coffee grind size or inadequate stirring of the grounds during brewing.  Proper grinding technique and ensuring even distribution of grounds in the filter basket are crucial for optimal results.

<h3>Carafe Pouring Mechanism: A Matter of Practice</h3>

The carafe's pouring mechanism, while functional, can be a little tricky for some users initially.  A little practice quickly mitigates this minor inconvenience.

<h3>Maintenance and Cleaning: Simple Steps for Long-Term Performance</h3>

Regular cleaning is essential to maintain the brewer's performance and longevity.  The glass-lined stainless steel carafe is relatively easy to clean, and the brewer itself is straightforward to maintain.  Following the manufacturer's cleaning instructions ensures optimal performance and extends the life of the machine.

<h2>Conclusion: A Premium Investment for the Discerning Coffee Lover</h2>

The Technivorm Moccamaster 79112 KBT Coffee Brewer 40 oz Polished Silver represents a premium investment in the pursuit of exceptional coffee. While minor quirks exist, the consistent brewing performance, precise temperature control, and stylish design make it a compelling choice for coffee enthusiasts who value quality, durability, and a consistently delicious cup.  Its capacity makes it ideal for larger households or those who frequently entertain.  If you're serious about your coffee and appreciate the finer points of brewing, the Moccamaster KBT is a worthy contender for your kitchen countertop.
