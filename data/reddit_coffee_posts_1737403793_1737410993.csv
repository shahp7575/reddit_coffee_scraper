1i62dsv,https://www.reddit.com/r/solarpunk/comments/1i62dsv/the_mobile_library_a_solarpunk_short_story/,The Mobile Library ~ A Solarpunk short story ,"I

The little finch soared swiftly among the dense fir trees, like a small, reddish-white bullet. It flew gracefully through the wild vegetation, its tiny body casting a shadow that danced across the dirt ground. Soon, this soil was replaced by asphalt, as the thick fir forest gave way to the country roads. The bird began to fly along the road. Suddenly, the sun, which had been shining above it until then, started to shine from the ground.

The bird almost stopped, confused for just a moment. Then, having reoriented itself, it dove down and landed softly on the cold, metallic body of the van, which was crossing the road like a giant steel turtle, slowing its already sluggish speed to check the surrounding vegetation, possibly searching for its next meal.

The van continued to move silently along the mountain road, using the energy provided by the solar panels that covered its roof. It was painted in a dark green color like a giant beetle, adorned with all sorts of designs, suns and flowers, wolves and trees, birds and stars, a feast of symbols that covered almost the entire exterior surface. The only slight discord in the decor was the words that had been painted in white on the side of the vehicle: *Evrytania Region Mobile Library Network.*

Orfeas carefully turned the van as he continued to ascend the mountain. The fir-covered peaks silently greeted him as he passed beneath them, the proud firs alternating with the shiny, white forms of the wind turbines, which turned silently, generating part of the energy used in the local villages. Orfeas glanced at his small GPS. He looked at the intricate red lines that symbolized the road network while he pondered. He had set off from Mega Chorio at exactly 5 in the morning... He had passed through Klavsi, Aniada, Mikro Chorio, Mouzilo, Roska, and Krikello, which meant... that he still had six or seven more stops before he could consider today’s route complete and stop.

He let out a slight sigh. When he was receiving his training in the library science workshop in Nafpaktos, he imagined his future as a member of one of the many public libraries that existed throughout the country. He would spend his time under dusty shelves loaded with volumes of books, creating catalogs, and perhaps even helping to organize a reading club with his colleagues – at least that was his initial aspiration.

And then he was offered a position at the Panhellenic Network of Mobile Libraries, which would have exactly the same responsibilities as the one he had dreamed of... except for the additional obligation of driving a van loaded with books to the most remote areas of Greece, bringing knowledge and entertainment to the residents of these distant lands, like another Prometheus, who brought down fire from the heavens for the benefit of Humanity. He had thought about it a lot. There was no reason to accept, nor could anyone force him to do so. Where he would work was his own decision, and there was no centralized administrative mechanism to prevent him from making it.

And in the end, he accepted. Since then and for the last two and a half years, he had learned the routes of these mountainous areas so well that it was as if he had been born there. There were about seven ""mobile librarians"" in Evrytania, and each of them followed a very specific route. This, of course, was not binding, and the librarians could negotiate among themselves and decide on their own schedule, which they did. You could be in the southern part of Evrytania for two months, and then cross the eastern mountain peaks of the region – as long as your load reached its destinations, the ""where"" didn't matter.

Orfeas looked at the back of the van through the rearview mirror. The driver's cabin was separated from the main area by a small window, which was now open. From there, one could discern the back cabin, its walls covered with rows of shelves, all loaded with books, magazines, CDs, and anything else one would expect from the neighborhood public library – only this one was on wheels. The cabin was quite spacious, allowing at least five or six people to be there at the same time. Orfeas couldn't help but smile slightly at the sight.

In their days, the search for and access to information and entertainment was easier than ever. There were literally billions of sources available in the global open source, completely free of charge, accessible simply by using a computer, mobile phone, or tablet. Countless articles, scientific papers, movies, series, music, manuals, novels, and anything else created by the human genius were laid out before the feet of the inhabitants of the Earth, with no barriers left between them. At that moment, one could open their phone and download a complete veterinary manual, or the latest action movie that had been released, or a full edition of *War and Peace*, and enjoy them without any difficulty.

And yet, a lot of people were still seeking the warmth of a paper book or a CD – and he completely understood that. Despite the convenience offered by the completely liberated internet, there was something special about reading a physical book, feeling the rough paper pages under your fingers, the weight of the cover, and smelling that unique scent that printed paper emits... No kind of high technology could replace that feeling, and it was precisely this need that people like him catered to.

He smiled again. In the back cabin, he had a list of orders made by regular visitors to his library. If you couldn't find a specific book that interested you, you would place an order with the driver-librarian, who would then relay it to the library's headquarters, where an effort would be made to fulfill it. If the specific book, magazine, record, or anything else that had been ordered was not available in the library, they would seek assistance from other public libraries across Greece – they could even search abroad if the need was significant.

The list this time, as with most times, was quite long, but the librarian could remember its main points: a copy of the *Practical Guide to Beekeeping in Cold Climates* for Tasos from Hochlia (who would definitely treat him to some jars of fresh honey), *Arabella* by Georgette Heyer for Aspasia from Agios Charalambos (he needed to remember to ask her for the recipe for that excellent walnut liqueur he had tried last time), the *Platonic Critique of Epicurean Philosophy* for Father Sotiris in Stenoma (they hadn't finished their discussion about that text by Chesterton yet), and that comic anthology for Elenitsa in Ambliani...

Once again, the corners of his lips lifted. This was yet another of the beauties of this profession: the many different people you encountered. In all his years of service as a librarian, he had met so many people, had engaged in countless conversations. He couldn't even estimate how many foreign homes he had slept in, in how many tables of strangers he had eaten at, how many celebrations and festivals he had been invited to... And all because he carried a dozen books to a few strangers.

It sounded simple, but for those strangers, it was the gateway to a new world.

II

\-        Nineteen degrees, yes, yes, nineteen degrees is the perfect temperature for the growth of tomatoes, said the elderly woman in a way that showed she had experience in these things.

Orfeas had leaned slightly over the wooden folding table, which served as his workbench, and was nodding his head as he listened to her. He had spent a few moons as a volunteer in the community gardens in Messolonghi, so the issue raised by the old lady was not indifferent to him.

\-        Sure, you can keep them at lower temperatures, he commented. Maybe around ten degrees, if you want to save on electricity...

The old woman cackled.

\-        Yes, and if you want to eat tomato ice cream!

Orfeas simply shook his head. He checked the items the woman had taken once more: two detective novels, a basket weaving manual, and a CD with traditional Pontic songs. He scanned them into his electronic catalog and nodded to her.

He had parked his van in the village's central square just a quarter of an hour ago. People were walking here and there, enjoying the somewhat chilly autumn morning. The enormous plane tree in the center of the square covered almost the entire area with its massive branches, providing a cool shade. Some villagers were sitting in front of the community center, chatting, sipping their coffee, or reading. A small group of people, men and women, had gathered around a projector, its internal parts spread out on a table like entrails, and they were trying to fix it. Every now and then, one of them would lift his head and look towards the center building, from which the soft purring of the 3D printer could be heard.

Since the moment he arrived, at least ten people had already visited his van. He served them by showing them books, taking orders, and suggesting titles from his stock. He tried to offer equal attention to each of them, but it was difficult, as almost everyone had something to say: about the weather, about some mushrooms they found on a walk in the forest, about a poem they wrote, about a disagreement they had with a fellow villager at the general assembly.

The librarian let out a slight sigh. Sometimes he wondered what the meaning of it all really was: wandering through the villages loaded with books, talking to every stranger about this or that, and then leaving for the next community. It brought him pleasure, yes, but what significance did it have? Did it have any specific *meaning*? And if not, then why continue doing it?

Heavy thoughts for a humble librarian, but when you have spent most of your life reading, you tend to make a mountain out of a molehill. He knew that in forty, fifty, or sixty years he would die. He also knew that the Earth was about four billion years old. Within this almost incomprehensible timeframe for the human mind, did it really matter what he would do with his life? Whether he would live his life? 

And then, why bother at all, and not just lie down in the dirt and die?

The sound of the village church bell reached his ears. The morning liturgy had already ended, so he assumed this was the call for the engineering workshop that took place in the church hall almost every other day, barring any unforeseen circumstances. A specialist was coming from Krikello to conduct the lesson.

Some people turned to God. The idea of an afterlife gave them strength and directed them towards good deeds. Some believed that it was simply the duty of a person to be kind to others. For them, common sense dictated that if you treat someone with kindness, they would treat you the same way, and the cycle would continue. Others saw everyone as children of the Earth, fruits from the same seed, and just as you wouldn’t harm a seed that was simply growing next to another, without having any significant difference, and without putting the entire garden at risk, you would have no reason to treat someone else or yourself poorly.

It wasn't the first time that such existential thoughts tormented him. One would expect that in a world that had abandoned war and oppression several hundred years ago, and where people were now completely free to develop their talents and desires, it would be impossible for someone to be plagued by such questions.

Yet, here he was.

Ultimately, people would continue to grapple with the meaning of their perhaps incomprehensible existence, regardless of their living conditions. A tree had leaves so that it could participate in the oxygen cycle. A stork had wings and feathers so that it could fly. Since the discovery of fire, Man has been trying to explain why they possess intelligence and why this intelligence has led them out of the caves and towards what they have created. The correct answer, whatever it may be, remains unknown.

\-        Hey! Do you listen to me?

The voice of the elderly woman brought Orfeas back to reality. He looked at her and blinked.

\-        Yes, yes, he mumbled.

\-        A friend of mine wanted to order a book, the old lady said, but she left yesterday to visit some relatives in Agrinio and told me to do it.

The librarian nodded and quickly recorded the details of the book that the woman had told him. He assured her that he would bring it the next time he passed through the village.

\-        Maybe you should ask to change your route, the old lady commented. It wouldn’t hurt you to change your experiences.

He simply nodded silently.

III

The van silently traversed the mountain roads, its shadow covering the dense vegetation that surrounded it as it passed. Vehicles of this kind could not reach very high speeds – something that did not bother Orfeas, who preferred to enjoy the gentle change of Nature in her autumn cloak. The plane trees had already taken on a golden-red hue, their coppery backs crossing the landscape like a sea of fire, burning without any flames. The soft scents of wet earth and wood danced in the air, trapped in the cool breeze that traveled between the mountain peaks.

Orfeas continued to drive slowly, paying attention to the light mist that had begun to cover the mountain peaks. He might need to use the fog lights later. He had already passed through three villages and was pressing on undeterred. The sun was now high in the sky, like a gigantic, fiery eye, half-hidden behind the clouds. He hadn't heard anything about rain for the time being. He grabbed his thermos from the holder and took a few sips of mountain tea. Then he set it aside, and his gaze fell on the small stack of books and magazines that was on the seat next to him. He ran his hand over the covers of the books and the cases of the discs. With his eyes still on the road, he picked one of them up, removed the CD, and placed it in the device on the dashboard of his vehicle.

He pressed play, and a woman's voice filled the small cabin, talking about cob architecture. Orfeas took out the record, flipped it over, and placed it back. A soft jazz song filled the atmosphere. The man smiled and continued to drive.

His gaze moved from the empty road to the edges of the forest that framed it, allowing him to enjoy the landscape. It took only a second for him to see the man standing at the edge of the asphalt, his hand raised in the characteristic gesture of hitchhiking. He was certainly a few years older than him, his skin sunburned and rough. His face was covered with a disheveled black beard, which helped to highlight his small, sparkling blue eyes. His hunting jacket was frayed and adorned with pine needles, and his heavy boots were stained with dried mud. A large hiking backpack hung from his back.

Orfeas approached him further, stopping the moving library almost in front of him. He lowered his window, and the stranger came closer, smiling.

\-        Good morning! Are you heading towards Karpenisi? he asked friendly. 

\-        No, Orfeas replied. I will be returning towards Mega Chorio... But if you want, I can take you with me.

The second man nodded affirmatively, and in half a minute, he was sitting in the seat next to Orfeas. Orfeas took the small stack of books and CDs, opened the little window that led to the back cabin, and carefully placed them on the table below. Then, he started the engine again and began to drive.

His new passenger took a few minutes to rest from the journey he had made. Orfeas did not disturb him. It was not the first time he had picked someone up hitchhiking. In the flatter areas, transportation was so easy that almost no one questioned it. Almost every city and town had a network for borrowing bicycles, scooters, and electric scooters, while public buses and trains connected every region of Greece. The only sound that could be heard now on Piraeus Avenue was the soft creaking of the tram that connected Athens with Piraeus.

In areas like this, however, things were more difficult. Being predominantly a mountainous country, it was not beneficial to construct large public transportation systems in certain regions of Greece. Here, buses, sun taxis, bicycles, and even the occasional horse-drawn cart mainly prevailed.

After a few minutes, the unknown man turned his head towards Orfeas.

\-        Gerasimos, he simply said. Thank you again for picking me up. I don't even know how long it would have taken me to walk. 

\-        No problem, Orfeas replied. Did you go camping somewhere up here?

Gerasimos smiled and unbuckled his backpack. He took out a large album with a hard cover and opened it. 

\-        I collect herbs, he said with some pride. Botany is a hobby of mine.

Orfeas took a quick glance at the album while continuing to drive. He didn't have much experience with herbs, but he could recognize quite a few: chamomile, oregano, Velouchi tea, orchid, hawthorn leaves, spathochorto, rizari, and several others that he couldn't identify. He nodded.

\- And do you exclusively work with herbs? he asked. 

The hiker shook his head as he put the album back in his backpack. 

\- I am a member of the carpentry cooperative in Karpenisi, he replied. 

Orfeas smiled as he turned. 

\- I had dabbled a bit in carpentry during my studies, he said. Unfortunately, the splinters and minor injuries from the hammer prevented me from loving it too much.

Gerasimos let out a loud laugh. 

\- To do something with love, you have to at least enjoy it a little, he said. I've always liked working with wood. It's incredible how many things you can make with it...

He put his hand in his bag and pulled out something else: a wooden cup, intricately carved. Its entire surface was covered with elaborate geometric patterns. Orfeas whistled in approval. 

\- I still prefer books, he finally said. 

They continued to talk about various things, about woodworking, about books they had both read, about teas and herbs for sleep. Orfeas suggested two or three books, and Gerasimos offered to go together for herb gathering if they met again. In the end, the librarian couldn't hold back and confided in the herbalist his worries about life and death, as if he had known him for years.

\- And why must your life necessarily have some meaning? asked Gerasimos, or rather, he wondered aloud. 

Orpheus raised an eyebrow. 

\- What do you mean? That life has no meaning? 

\- No, of course not, the carpenter continued. I just believe that there isn't a central meaning to life. We give life the meaning we want, through our actions. 

\- But then, what’s the point of living? the other said somewhat irritably.

Gerasimos shrugged his shoulders. 

   \-  My friend, you were placed in this world by the Universe, God, Fate, call it what you will, without any instruction manual. Perhaps this means that any higher power up there allows you the freedom to choose what the meaning of your life will be. 

Orfeas remained silent for a moment. Then he smiled.

\-        I love you and I forgive you. I am like you and you are like me. I love all people. I love the world. I love creating. Everything in our life should be based on love….

His co-driver looked at him in confusion. Orfeas continued to smile. 

 \- From Ray Bradbury, he said. 

 \- The one who wrote that story about the guys who burned books? asked Gerasimos, looking back towards the library.

Orfeas nodded. Gerasimos lay back in his seat. Outside, the sky was gray, and the van was moving at a reduced speed. This did not bother the two travelers, who had the opportunity once again to enjoy the grandeur of the world around them. The cold breeze made the golden-yellow autumn leaves sway gracefully. Somewhere on the horizon, the silhouette of a hawk could be seen soaring through the skies. The wind turbines were turning a little faster.

IV

The librarian wiped the sweat from his forehead and then adjusted his knitted sweater. The temperature had noticeably dropped, along with the sunlight, but he felt as if he were burning. 

\- Are you okay? he heard Gerasimos' voice behind him, as the man's rough hand squeezed his shoulder. 

Orfeas turned his head slightly and smiled. He was just fine.

He couldn't imagine how quickly they had passed through five more villages. Normally, after so much time on the road, it should have seemed normal to him: it was a routine, something he had gotten used to doing, something he loved, and usually, these things flow pleasantly, effortlessly, like honey slowly making its way through the honeycomb to the jar.

The light had now fallen, and the sky was painted with mauve and crimson colors, as if someone had drenched it in wine. Around them, the square of the small village had begun to come alive. People were sitting at tables, talking, laughing, or eating. A group seemed absorbed in some board game. Some more adventurous souls had sat down and sprawled out on large, thick blankets spread out on the cobblestones, with small electric lanterns placed among them. Somewhere in the distance, a guitar could be heard. The entire square was illuminated by rows of small lanterns hanging from wires that started from the nearest buildings in the square and converged at the enormous ancient oak standing proudly in the center of the space. From a distance, they looked like giant fireflies that had flooded the square of the small village, as if it were a supernatural night-blooming flower nestled among the mountains.

Orfeas sat in the recess of the open sliding door of the van, lost in the scene before him. As in every other stop, he had spent most of the time in a state between work and leisure: recommending books, meeting old acquaintances, taking orders, laughing at the stories they had to tell him...

Many times, he found himself torn between whether he preferred to be alone or to enjoy the company of others. He loved the long journeys he took with the mobile library, just him and the road. It gave him time to organize his thoughts and relax his mind. On the other hand, he wouldn’t trade those moments when he stopped in a village or a small town, surrounded by other people—friends, readers, travelers, people he knew and people he didn’t know, and whom he might never see again. Man is a social animal, except for the moments when he retreated back to his refuge, seeking the voice of his own mind.

People were probably both: they were social and they were isolationists. It depended on one's mood as well as the responsibility one had.

At least another hour passed with villagers coming and going, dozens of books, CDs, and USB sticks changing hands. Many things were said—stories, jokes, complaints—and at least three variations of a recipe for orange pie, with each of the three speakers swearing that theirs was the authentic one.

At some point, Orfeas greeted their last visitor for the day. The square was now full, despite the cold atmosphere. The fallen leaves of the oak created a golden-red carpet on the cobblestones, which was stirred by the feet of small children who were still running around, shouting and laughing. A woman from a nearby group greeted Orfeas and gestured for him to come and sit with them. He nodded and turned to Gerasimos. He was about to speak to him when he stopped. The bearded man had his gaze fixed on the sky.

The librarian also looked up. Despite the gloomy weather of the morning, the sky was now clear. Myriads of small stars shone in the firmament like diamonds. Gerasimos looked at Orfeas, his gaze full of meaning. He nodded. In two minutes, they had gathered their stuff and were sitting in the van's cabin. The librarian reassured the others that they would return soon. They had one last stop to make.

The vehicle began to move slowly, crossing the main road of the village towards the outskirts. The solar generator had started up, supporting the engine as much as it could. Soon, the lights of the village were behind them, while before them stretched the dark forest, calm and asleep under the cloak of Night.

They didn't need to travel far. Soon, Orfeas drove the van to a hill, about forty minutes away from the village. There was no one there except for the two men and the grandeur of Mother Nature. The fir trees stood silently, one close to the other, mute and ever-moving sentinels of the Evrytania mountains. Nothing could be heard, except for the whisper of the wind among the branches and the breaths of the two men sitting inside the van's cabin without uttering a word. The cicadas had long since fallen into hibernation.

After a few minutes, Gerasimos moved. He opened the van door and stepped out, letting the cold air caress his face. He looked up and allowed himself to get lost in the vastness of the void, in that ebony veil that covered the world. He sensed Orfeas, who came and stood beside him, but he did not speak. Nor did Orfeas speak. They simply remained there, two grains of sand riding on a ball of soil and water at the center of one of the countless Galaxies that made up the whole.

When Orfeas turned and walked back to the van, Gerasimos heard him. After a minute, he returned, holding two pillows and two blankets. Still silent, the two men sat down on the ground, wrapped in the woolen blankets, their eyes still gazing at the night sky.

\- I was thinking of writing a book, Orfeas suddenly said, breaking the silence, although his voice remained low, as if they were in a temple. 

Gerasimos looked at him silently for a few moments, with a calm expression. 

\- Oh, a novel? he finally asked. 

The other shook his head. 

\- I was thinking of something like... like an account of my life as a mobile librarian... not an autobiography, just a record of my daily life, the way I work, my opinions... 

The botanist nodded in agreement. 

\- That sounds good... it's not an activity that everyone knows about. I have an acquaintance in Karpenisi who is in a publishing cooperative... they mainly publish books online, through open source. If you want... 

\- Thank you, Orfeas replied. That sounds good to me. 

Once again, silence enveloped them. The cold had become a bit sharper now, and little clouds of vapor were rising from their mouths with each breath. They would need to return to the village soon.

\- you know, Gerasimos said again, I was thinking about the conversation we had this morning... In the end, what has meaning in life is what we create: your book, my works in the carpentry... These give us meaning – because they help us remember that we are conscious beings, and not just rocks being battered by the waves.

Orfeas looked at the other man as he spoke. Yes, he liked this explanation. Perhaps it wasn't the right one, perhaps he would find another in the future... but for now, it was enough for him.

1i62bp0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Onyx_Boox/comments/1i62bp0/recently_purchased_a_palma_initial_impressions/,Recently Purchased a Palma - Initial Impressions,"**Bottom line:**

I'm happy with my purchase since I got it at a discount, and will be using this as my daily e-reading device for the foreseeable future for its size and flexibility. There's a couple negatives for sure, but they aren't deal breakers for me. 

**Context:**

I was on the fence about other e-readers to replace my 2018 Kindle Paperwhite since I've been a heavy reader of books outside the kindle ecosystem (Libby, Hoopla, online book bundles, et cetera), and I had my eyes on a Boox device specifically for the flexibility of android OS. I wasn't in a hurry to switch, but then I found an incredible deal on a like-new Boox Palma (50% off) locally (it had been acquired in a liquidation pallet). 

**First Impressions:**

I was a little worried since this is the older version of the Palma, but there haven't been any glaring issues or noticeable glitches/bugs. The weight is about the same of my Paperwhite, and the screen isn't much smaller (a smidge taller, less wide). I was already able to comfortably hold the paperwhite with on hand, so the slimmer size is a bit more comfortable. The physical volume buttons allow for turning pages without using the other hand as well. It feels sturdy and well-built, though I will be considering a slim case with a pop-socket for extra grip. I like the function button as well for quick access to things like screen refresh and closing background apps. 

**Highlights:**

* I'm able to directly download books on the Libby and Hoopla apps for offline reading, plus I can use Calibre to easily manage and send books to my Palma via USB. I can always add other store apps too, if needed.
* It's use can be extended to audiobooks, podcasts, and maybe even downloaded music (reducing the times I'll be reaching for my phone for entertainment).
* The form factor is really nice - it's easy to carry in a pocket for reading at home or on the go. I can see myself leaving my phone at home more often when I'm going out for some coffee or lunch by myself. 

**Negatives:**

* The battery drains faster than my older Kindle, even with airplane mode on 95% of the time and the screen brightness off/on the lowest level. I estimate that I'll be charging this weekly or every other week based on my usage. 
* The interface and managing settings across the device and apps can be a bit tedious. This wasn't a big deal for me, but it is something to consider. 
* I'm unsure what to expect, if anything, in terms of firmware and security updates going forward. It doesn't hurt to use some common precautions like avoiding untrusted apps/websites and isolating it from your primary accounts if you'll be doing a lot online. ",1,1737410229.0,Onyx_Boox,0,1.0,False

There is a lot of debate where to spend it; on Vancouver Island or doing a few days in Vancouver and a few in Seattle. Both would be road trips. We have both been to Vancouver and Seattle - but not for 20years!

Day 1 - arrive Victoria, overnight

Otherwise we stay in Vancouver for 2 days  and head to Seattle for a few days - looking for good food, beer, coffee, sightseeing a bit of walking and hopefully some sort of live sport - NFL. Wrong order, haha!

* I'm going to be late (sometimes for things that have no deadline - just a general sense of 'I'm doing this at the wrong time')

* This is going to take forever and I already know I'm not going to go the distance because I'm so inconsistent.
* If I finish this, I'm going to have to do x and y, and oh my god, I don't know if I'll be able to handle that ---> I just don't know enough/I should do more research to prepare

One day, Pete walked into his favorite coffee shop and saw a group of people laughing at a table. He thought, *“This is my moment to prove I’m one of them!”* So, he strutted over to the counter and made a big show of ordering his coffee.

“Yeah, I’ll have a triple-shot caramel macchiato, extra hot, no whip,” Pete announced loud enough for everyone to hear, hoping someone would think, *Wow, this guy knows his coffee.*

As he waited for his drink, Pete rehearsed his next move in his head: *I’ll casually turn, catch their eye, make a joke about the weather, and BOOM—instant friends.*

When his coffee was ready, Pete spun around too quickly, sloshing half the drink onto his shirt. The group noticed. Pete’s mind raced. *Prove you’re not embarrassed, Pete! Laugh it off! Say something witty!*

So, Pete blurted out, “Guess I ordered a caramel shower instead!”

The group chuckled politely, but Pete’s inner monologue was already spiraling: *They think you’re a weirdo. That wasn’t funny. Now you’ve really blown it. Better double down and prove you’re cool.*

Pete decided to force a joke about how his shirt looked like “modern art.” By now, the group was politely nodding, but their interest had clearly waned. Pete, deflated, slunk out of the coffee shop thinking, *I’ll never be normal. Why can’t I just connect with people?*

# What Pete Didn’t Realize

Pete’s entire interaction was driven by the need to *prove* something: that he was funny, likable, and worth noticing. But his effort to control how others saw him only made him come across as try-hard and unnatural.

If Pete had been grounded in his own worth, he might have handled things differently. Imagine if, instead of proving, Pete embraced the situation as it was:

1. **Spilling his coffee:** Instead of trying to spin it into a performance, Pete could’ve laughed and said, “Well, that’s one way to stay awake.”
2. **Talking to the group:** Instead of forcing humor, he could’ve said, “Hey, sorry for the mess—how’s your morning going?”

By dropping the act and being present, Pete could’ve allowed genuine connection to emerge, even if it wasn’t perfect.

# What Proving Pete Learned

Pete eventually realized that proving himself was like trying to row a boat with a hole in it. No matter how hard he rowed, the water kept pouring in. Instead, he needed to patch the hole—his belief that he wasn’t already enough.

The next time Pete went to the coffee shop, he didn’t overthink. When he accidentally knocked over a sugar dispenser, he just said, “Oops, sugar explosion!” and let it go. The barista laughed, the group glanced over and smiled, and Pete walked away feeling...okay. Not perfect, but okay.

And that was enough.

The moral? Don’t be Proving Pete. When you catch yourself trying too hard, remember the coffee shop incident and how Pete’s attempts to *prove* himself only pushed people away. Instead, focus on showing up as you are—spills and all. Because connection isn’t about perfection; it’s about being human.",1,1737408998.0,socialanxiety,0,1.0,False
1i61ths,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismInWomen/comments/1i61ths/psychoanalysis_trigger_warning/,Psychoanalysis (trigger warning),"Psychoanalysis is a favourite topic. I am autistic with ABA and a high achiever. Below is a theory of everything but might be confronting.

I am making many links in my family with ND as a common denominator. Specifically a heightened nervous system as the base cause, frequently ABA then different traits dependent on personality and temperament. I think of it like SIMs personality bars with different things dialled up.

I think the reason so many say we are all a little on the spectrum is because aspects of the brain structure that are the baseline cause of ND are way more common than we think. I don't take offense here as I truly believe there is an element in a lot of people I know with the spectrum being infinite in a sense (and probably wibbly wobbly). I think we are most likely to recognise those closest to us in phenotype and dismiss anyone who seems more capable than us. We may easily chat to those with similar abilities and we might be inspired by the others.

ND is a dialled up nervous system and divergent thinking. NT is a dialled down nervous system and greater thinking like a pack. I hypothesise that a dialled up nervous system/ND is a baseline theory for many different issues.

I also think ABA is more common than people think across NT and ND just that some people defer their thinking to others, religion or rules to outsource the stress of needing control. ABA can present as type we know it as which uses sophisticated social manipulation to keep their nervous system dialled down. However, ABA also makes sense as a reason for stress around being touched for example and being incredibly distressed at impaired abilities to do things like dress oneself or perceiving others as manipulating us.

I think ND characteristics and a dialled up nervous system (baseline or triggered by life events) can explain many mental illnesses. Bipolar and anxiety are talked about already. Also phobias, restless legs, coffee addiction, where to stop.

I also hypothesise that some dementias may be a result of ""glitching"" after a lifetime of masking. The glimpses sometimes seen of the person they used to be is the masking ability coming back for a bit.

Perhaps immunity and autoimmunity is also linked.

Attachment theory mediates the phenotype seen. Sleep training may be fine for some babies, neutral in others or impossible or devastating depending on the ND.

Intergenerational trauma would be related depending on parenting styles, traits of child and parent, life events. Of course identifying ND as a potential link mid-life though is too confronting to the careful self most have built up.

ND traits are essential for society and keep many things running or lead to leaps forward. Only certain phenotypes or degrees become truly dysfunctional or overt and depending on the environment.

Leadership courses should actually include info on autism burnout and PDA in their courses. You don't need to uniquely identify everyone on your team by their ND but applying some understanding here and avoiding manipulation tactics would go a long way to fixing some workplaces.

Hey everyone.

So I’m a bearded and tattooed guy that is also a dad. I’m married, have a fantastic job, travel a lot, and living a life most would be envious of.

But I’m also lonely and mostly tired.

About me first. I work quite a bit. Sometimes I travel, most times I find. But my life is basically just meetings about meetings and it’s exhausting. I play some music while working. I play guitar and piano, neither one very good but I think they’re decent at least. I read a lot which makes me write a lot. I write mostly poetry and short stories. Nothing longer has lived up to my expectations. 

I’m a coffee snob that loves concerts. If you like a band I let have already seen them live. I love it. I love to cook, and I really enjoy nerdy things like making spreadsheets for everything. Both arms are covered in ink and I plan to get many more.

You? Just be cool. I don’t have stipulations other than you at least try to have convo. I want to be seen and heard and I want someone I look forward to talking to.

It’s gotten to a point where I went to the bar with my friends and I made eye contact with a cute girl and she waved me over to dance with her. She even put out her hand. I tried asking for her name but I couldn’t hear because it was too loud. One of her guy friends came over and did one of those side hugs and I just went back to my friends.

I live alone and am out of the house at least three days for work and a couple of evenings a week for social stuff.

When I am home I only use what I need, ie I'm one person sat in one room so electricity for light in that room, TV when I'm watching it, power for work laptop etc when working from home, only ever charging one phone, boiling kettle just for my coffee once a day and heating as needed. There's not really a lot I could choose to cut down. It's not like a family or multiple occupancy where people might be running all sorts around the house?

I do usually 2 loads of washing a week, showers for just me. 

So I just don't get the whole ""see where you could save"" and know what days to use more or less energy. Especially if I am not home on the ""use more today"" days.....

I Feel So Much Despair,"There are so many ways in which people can be wrong for each other that I am starting to think I can never find happiness. When I'm physically attracted to someone, they are often boring. When someone is a good conversationalist, I'm often not attracted to them. These are pretty normal and I take them in stride.

Recently I (33M) connected on an app with a woman (32F) with whom the conversation was electric. She would often hit me up at night and say ""What are we talking about tonight?"" We were both so eager to interact. One of the many things I revealed during these chats is that I am a very sensitive person who expresses my feelings. She offered that she is an empathetic person, often to a fault. This was a drop in the sea of conversation.

We met for coffee and the chemistry was exactly the same high quality. Only to have her tell me later that, while the connection was as good as she hoped, she had anxiety about dating someone so communicative about their feelings. She had never done it and worried she would never tend to her own needs if she did, only prioritizing theirs. Consequently, she does not want to see each other again.

I feel totally hopeless about the pursuit of romance right now. It feels like people are so intent on finding reasons things can't work, to the point where this wonderful, charming woman imagined conflicts that would tank us down the road. We had never handled even the most minor of problems together; I am so baffled that she felt she knew we'd handle them poorly.

(Not literally - we're not making a meditation app either!)

I'm a non-tech founder with:
- A validated problem in the entertainment/booking space
- Existing market players ready for partnership
- A clear vision and business strategy
- Enough enthusiasm to power a small city

What I need is YOU - someone who can:
- Transform coffee-fueled ideas into beautiful, working code
- Navigate the mobile app ecosystem like it's your backyard
- Get excited about building something meaningful
- Appreciate a partner who knows their business but won't try to explain coding to you

Think of this as a chance to be the Tony Stark to my Pepper Potts (minus the explosions) - you bring the tech genius, I'll bring the business acumen and industry connections.

If you're ready to disrupt the entertainment booking space and potentially create something huge, let's talk! Bonus points if you can explain technical concepts without making me feel like I'm reading ancient Sanskrit.

1i61l9j,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1i61l9j/i_heard_my_colleague_facepalm/,I heard my colleague facepalm,"This one happen to my colleague (let's call him Z), so this is a second hand account.

We were a 2 man IT department for everything (you name it, if it had a light on or blinking, it was IT related...), for about 40 people.

From my perspective: Z was on a phone call with M, a 70yo lady (IMO she shouldn't be around a sowing machine, let alone a computer). I wasn't paying attention to the conversation, until I heard a literal facepalm from his direction. After the call was over, we went out for coffee and then he told me this story.

M called because she couldn't read her emails.
Out of laziness and being busy with other stuff (that cost him dearly, 30m on the phone to be exact), Z didn't want to go down 2 flights of stairs to solve this, so he was on the phone trying to understand the problem, it could be something related to the mail server.

Z: ""can you see any email?""

M: ""no""

Z: ""is there any error message? Maybe near the corner of the window or something""

M: ""I can't see any""

Z: ""can you login to the webmail interface just to check?""

M: ""it's not working, I can't see anything"".

Z: ""is your Outlook open?""

M: ""no.""

Z: ""can you open it?""

M: ""no! I click everywhere and it doesn't do anything.""

Z (starting to despair): do you see anything? Is the monitor on?""

M: ""yes, it's on. Oh, I have a text here. It says 'wrong password'  ""


She was stuck on the login screen... Of course she couldn't read her emails. Almost 20m on the phone until she mentioned the wrong password. And no, this is not the facepalm moment.


Z: ""did you change your password recently?""

M: ""yes, yesterday right before I left work. How did you know?""

Z (trying to breathe through his nose, to stamp out the urge to go down there and throw that woman from the nearest window): ""then you have to insert the new password...""

M: ""but I have! And I'm telling you, it's not doing anything!""


The plot thickens.
Then, suddenly....


M: ""oh, There is a text here that says 'caps lock is on' ""


Queue facepalm.
And when you thought it couldn't get any worse...


Z: ""well, just turn it off""

M: ""of course. That's the thing coming out of the wall, isn't it?""


You could hear a pin drop.


Z: ""no, it's the key right next to the A on your keyboard. Just press it once.""

M: ""oh the message is gone now""

Z: ""can you try your password again?""

M: ""the new one?""

Z: ""yes, the new one"".

M: ""now it worked""

Z: ""can you open your Outlook now?""

M: ""sorry, what?""

Z: ""the emails. Can you see them now?""

M: ""yes! Here they are!""

Z: ""ok. Bye""


And hung up the phone.


Z: ""hey J (that's me), I need to get a coffee. Wanna come?""


Just a little more context: M locked her PC, monitor, mouse AND keyboard on a cupboard, whenever she had to go to the bathroom ""so no one can steal her stuff"". That kind of user. And being 70yo, everything was, for the lack of a better word, slow. Gruellingly slow.

Hey everyone, trying to get better at my latte art, but not really sure where I'm going wrong.

* pulling a \~32g double shot of espresso
* steaming properly (inserting a little air, creating swirl, till it gets more volume and silky and hot)
* I pour the espresso shot from a small glass into a coffee cup (is this part of the problem at all?)
* then I pour the milk in like videos show, but then it just never gets to the point where I feel like I can ""draw"" art with the milk. The very very end of the steamed milk leaves nice white marks, but it's very minimal and acts more like droplets

1i61d1s,https://www.reddit.com/r/OrthodoxChristianity/comments/1i61d1s/feel_very_lonely_converting_from_a_nontheistic/,Feel very lonely converting from a non-theistic background,"For clarification I am not officially part of any church but I have considered myself Christian for 3 or 4 years and have inquired into Orthodoxy for just as long. There was not really any specific push for this, except that I had the urge to buy a large crucifix and I wore it almost constantly, though the chain broke all the time and I eventually lost the pendant. Something primordial was swirling around in me, nothing that I can describe, I could just feel the presence of God despite having very little working knowledge or experience of Christianity. 

  
My family is very loosely Christian and I went to Sunday school as a kid but it was more of a daycare than anything. I didn't like being in it and begged to stay at home and that basically ended my relationship with any church. I was never baptized as an infant which is a large source of shame to me. Something that drove me away from Christianity was being taken to a protestant church when I was visiting family and they had an arcade inside and basically nonstop loud concerts. It disgusted me and it felt like an affront to God. 

  
I'm not knowledgeable about the Bible, I've only read through Genesis and John in full. Even then I don't really understand them, feel frustrated while reading them, and can really only stomach reading a chapter or two a day. I have no real concept of the religious calendar or the cultural undertones behind it all. Yes, I have been to my local Orthodox church about 5 times and can become entranced with the sermons and the incense and atmosphere lifting my nose towards God I still feel a deep discomfort and misplacement in being there. Like I am intruding, that I am a poser and cannot ever hope to live up to the deeply rooted knowledge of holiness that these people have. 

The last time I went was in August, and I took my boyfriend who had been raised staunchly Christian but estranged from the faith for a long time. I always consider it a treat whenever I am able to go as I cannot drive still (actually being able to get to church was my main motivator in learning). I love going there yet I feel completely clueless and lost and want to run out before anyone talks to me again. I remember tugging his arm to get out before anyone invited us to come to coffee hour.

All this to say that there feels like an immovable barrier preventing me from being baptized which also prevents me to someday marrying my boyfriend. I yearn to belong within the church but I find all of this insurmountable and sometimes think it would be better if I practice my faith in private and avoid churches. I often feel very hopeless and alone in my pursuit because it seems like most people who convert have experience in Christianity or another religion and are familiar with the devotion, rituals, and routines that come with it while I feel isolated from even protestants of which I would be the most familiar with. I don't feel like the Orthodox church experience is strange or alternative to what I'm used to, however, because I haven't really been in any other church for their services. When I had my grandma bring me she seemed to find it very otherworldly or almost cultish seeing the women in skirts and head covering and kissing the ground in prayer. 

I just don't really know where to go now. I feel like I've totally stalled in my spiritual progression and I mostly just want to take the easy way out and immerse myself in my own understanding of Orthodoxy and keep it a private thing close to heart, while still always being an outsider as I'm not baptized or accepted.

We get along well and every bump that comes up has eventually been figured out. However, I need some advice on this aspect. 

I would consider myself and my bf both pretty chill people. We are both the kind of people to not take things too seriously. (I guess maybe I’m not that chill if i’m on here saying i’m chill). However, I would say that I take “leadership” in the relationship since he’s just a bit too chill sometimes. This only comes up when cleaning or making random decisions (choosing where to eat, what to do for the day, what to watch, etc.) He will always answer my question with a question; ex: “Are you hungry?” “Are you?”. I know he is being nice and considering my input, but after a while, I would just like a direct answer. 

Anyways, this ties into doing the chores around the apartment. I have found that if I don’t initiate the cleaning, it will not be done. So, I will bring up things that need to be done around the house and we discuss who will do what. My issue is, I am tired of being the one to take the first step. It makes me feel like I am his babysitter or something. I have tried not cleaning his mess to see if he would notice but he never does. I will show him and tell him that I waited a week for him to take the pot he used that still had food off the stove and at least put it in the sink. He would reply with “sorry” and sigh and look like a kid that just got scolded. I do so in a lighthearted yet stern way to let him know that I’m not pissed just frustrated. Its the littlest things too. Another example: he has never put the toilet paper on the holder since moving in. He takes a new roll and puts in on the counter top and will use that until he needs to grab another. It makes me feel like i’m going crazy because he doesn’t see that it is more than just a roll of toilet paper.  

After catching up with some of my girl friends, we found that we are in the same boat. I really do not want to say that this is a “guy thing” bc that is not fair and gives him an excuse. We grew up in different households so I understand why we have different expectations of how our place should be. Example: I will clean the place before having guests over while he will let the guest sit on or next to the mess. (He couldn’t even move my laptop he borrowed from the coffee table and they played drinking games on top of it, while I went home for the weekend). I keep trying to explain why I prefer to have a cleaner apartment, and he never argues his. I don’t know if he doesn’t have the energy to explain his side or what but he will just say “yeah that makes sense” but it never sticks. I feel like a bitch every time bc I care more about it and it sucks. Being the “chill guy” he is, he will just say “sure” and do what I ask. Which sounds amazing but circles back to, I DONT WANT TO INITIATE THE CLEANING EVERYTIME. 

So please, how have you guys gone about sharing chores? I need ideas! Is a chore list too childish? (I work full time, he works part time and goes to classes, we have two cats and no kids). ",2,1737407813.0,relationship_advice,3,1.0,False

(Skip 5 lines down if you do not wish to read a huge story and get straight to the question/information about the specific Macintosh 512k I have).

Growing up, I’ve always had an affinity of history especially the history of technology and how far it’s come to keep my mind refreshed about the current state of technology and how far it’s advanced.

I usually watch videos on YouTube about old tech like cameras, phones, computers, etc.

Recently I watched “Teaching an Old Mac New Tricks” by Hunter Irving, and I was hooked!  It was everything I could’ve wanted, two completely different worlds of technology colliding!

I always envisioned having one myself in my home and to take with me to local coffee shops to have another form of writing on a computer but this time with an conventional machine compared to the common laptop or iPad people walk in with.  Yes It was most likely a vision thought up of for the means of a public stunt for laughs, but overtime I got more serious about art and writing and figured that maybe using a uncommon device in a public setting might leave me in a more focused scenario.

I have no idea if anything Hunter Irving did to his model in his YouTube video will work on mine for it’s a different model.  Even if not I wanna know exactly what I need/should have for my model, and exactly the kind of things I can do with it.

It came with its keyboard, mouse, and power cord but that’s all really all I have are those.  When it’s powered on, the mouse works but it just shows a floppy disk with an “X” on it, I know nothing inside and out these machines or what else might be wrong with it, will be asking and answering all the questions moving forward!!!

# Conclusion

Overall, coming from NYC, we didn’t love the touristy and shopping vibe in Waikiki; we much preferred Maui (Ka‘anapali) and Big Island (Hapuna Beach). Seeing the whales up close, witnessing the eruption, learning about bees and vanilla farming were all highlights of our trip. Hapuna Beach has the softest sand and least rocks compared to Waikiki or Ka‘anapali. We were very happy to be in Hawaii and escape the snow for a little bit. Hope this helps and enjoy your trip!",5,1737407564.0,VisitingHawaii,0,0.86,False
1i6184f,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1i6184f/for_those_that_are_struggling_read/,"For those that are struggling, read","Do you ever get the feeling like your life has a purpose but you yourself don't know what that is? Well recently I realized that I seem to be the person people are using to base their style off of and people started copying things I did or I would be in a situation where someone needed help, like people in crisis or really bad things. Had I realized sooner what my role was, I might have been able to help them and didn't realize it til later. My friend died of a drug overdose when she was in her 20's. I never knew what to say to her or how to deal. Like I thought what if I knew then I could have done more before she went into hard drugs. She threw her life away because she didnt think she was worth anything. She was head cheer-leader. I've never been afraid to stand on my own. So I think maybe I am supposed to do something now.  to help people and I think somehow I think people need to feel like somebody's got their back. So i'm putting this out there to give people ideas. we've been unemployed now for two years, ran out of food and money and all that but I feel like many others are in the same boat and people just don't know what else to do at this point. Below I'm going to share some things I used during the '09 recession that got me through it. Here goes:

Look up John Crant career coach, selfrecruiter. If anything he'll keep you motivated, watch his videos and listen to podcasts.

If you need things, go to buynothing groups on facebook, go to food pantries to get food 

Go to the library every day for one hour, find something to learn about, anything, or just go for free heat and electricity lol. Don't isolate. I spent each day at the city's nypl. I went out, got a coffee , hopped on a bus or train and that was literally my day. I got out of the house and was near people. I used to bring an interesting book and dressed neatly. Not fancy but just presentable, you never know who you will meet. I found two jobs after by meeting someone on the train. You have to be in it to win it.

Temping and recruitment firms, go in person or contact them online. You can temp until you find FT. I used professionals for non-profits. Find what you have in your area. 

Working two jobs is sometimes the way until the economy gets better. I also worked retail in a non-sales role. That means you are exempt from selling quotas and cant get fired for not meeting your numbers. And you get clothes at bottom prices that are new.

Need training or want to stay relevant? Try education sites like coursera or google online training for your needs. Coursera lets you audit a course and it keeps you active. Its good to use as a supplement to what you already have. 

Join groups that meet on-site. It's much better to go in person. Eventbrite always has something to offer. Or join a professional group for your specific industry.

Lastly, unemployment brings shame and despair, people want to cope with alcohol or drugs. Stop that right now. Addiction spirals and changes you. Get help, replace it with exercise or distraction...don't despair, eat healthy, you got this. 

988 is the number to call for crisis

The headspace app helps , download it and try it for one week 

And download games like brain training games help to cope and reduce stress, try to pick non addictive ones, peak , mahjong, and zuma were what i used

Also just take your headphones and your phone and put on binaural beats, you can get that on youtube

Lastly, get off tik tok and social media and put on some good vibrations and that will get you through the next moment, repeat as necessary. 



I hope things improve and i hope people can be ok. Keep trying and keep moving forward.

1) my mom has Type 2 diabetes and my dad had Alzheimer’s, which many healthcare professionals are calling “Type 3 Diabetes.”
2) In August 2023, I discovered I was fully menopausal and had a borderline pre-diabetes HA1C level
3) I have always been an ideal weight, exercised regularly (4-6 days a week for decades), and eaten what I thought was a healthy diet. But menopause has proven a challenge for me—I’ve gained weight without and major changes to diet and activity and I haven’t been able to lose it, despite trying a lot of different things. 

I have learned what foods affect my blood glucose level. I am still experimenting, but I want to lose weight and I finally feel like I’m on the right track. I don’t weigh myself, but I have less belly fat, esp the loose skin/cellulite, and my clothes are fitting better (that was the one thing that really bothered me about my weight gain!)

I have learned that most fruits will cause a rise in my glucose, even when eaten with protein and fat, unless I eat a very small portion. It is worse when eaten for breakfast. Same with potatoes and refined carbs. That makes me sad but oh well! I can live with it and enjoy these foods in moderation, in a way that does not cause a spike. 

I have been following a lot of the recommendations of the Glucose Goddess. 1) Eat a Savory breakfast with few to no carbs, 2) Clothe your carbs (eat fiber first, then protein and fat, and starchy carbs last), 3) Move after eating for 10+ minutes, 4) Have a “veggie starter” before dinner—my husband and I have been doing raw carrots and celery, fermented vegetables, pickles, and other low carb veggies with blue cheese dressing and sometimes some charcuterie, 5) Avoid sweet snacks, go savory and save sweets for dessert, if at all. 

I have also been intermittent fasting 16/8. Some days I will do one meal a day and some days I only fast 12 hours to switch it up. But I don’t eat anything for at least 12 hours between dinner and breakfast. That seems to work for me. My glucose remains steady with coffee, monk fruit extract, and a little cream until I eat.  

My best days/those without big glucose spikes or when I stay low on my Lingo Count, are those in which I eat a lower carb diet. I know that if I want to lose weight this is going to be the best strategy. I also know that this will need to be a lifestyle change if I want to avoid diabetes and lower my risk of Alzheimer’s. 

The great thing is, eating this way does not make me feel deprived! I feel full and satiated, and I don’t feel hungry until four or more hours after eating. I used to get “hangry” and I don’t anymore! 

I’m going to keep using the CGM for a couple of months. It does a great job of keeping me accountable. Who knew that “Lingo Count” would be a motivating metric for me—lol! 

Would love to hear what others have learned on their journey.

I understand we all sin, and will continue to sin. But 'actively' sinning with videos that stay on the internet to me is out of control.They dont see the error of their ways, are they going to do that at the gates of heaven? No repentance no care no modesty in their hearts. All in the name of the attention they get..that's their God. This isn't a judgement but its a post in the hopes something can change. I feel God has called me to call out this behaviour. I'm not perfect but if I can help these so called christians I will. Some I can imagine just don't know how serious it it and could do with a gentle push, others need a full truth to show how this is what leads them to more sin.

Not really sure how to word this but see how it goes. Interesting to know people’s thoughts. 

Anyway, there’s this girl that I like which I haven’t known for too long. We work in the same profession but different places. I first met her at kind of a network meeting (both our places of work fall under the same trust) didn’t really talk to her at all but did communicate briefly through email. 

Last week as part of a wider network meeting she was there (I wasn’t aware she was gonna be there) there were like 4 different locations you could be at. Anyway coincidentally I ended up sitting next to her for this thing, ended up talking to her for the 2 and a half hours mainly about work. Towards the end I asked her if she wanted to grab a coffee, she initially said no. A few minutes later she turns around and changes her mind. We leave this thing, she mentions that she only has 20 minutes before her bus. We grab a coffee and were there longer than 20 minutes probably around 40 ish. It was genuinely one of the best conversations I’ve had in a long time. I ended up asking for number which she said she had recently changed it and couldn’t remember it off the top of her head. But then she gave me her phone to put my number in (didn’t ask her to do that). 

But she never texted me… I also never asked her too (I should’ve have). Quite disappointed by that because I could tell we were quite similar and just how we got on. 

I emailed her the next morning which she mentioned she totally forgot (Not sure if it was genuine) but even replies to that were vague. I will add that she seems very work driven and professional in that sense. 

We have another network meeting in just over a week - I don’t know if she is gonna be there. I’m hoping to just be straight up with her and tell her that I like her? (That’s worded poorly but too that affect). But if she isn’t then what can I do? There’s a chance that I wouldn’t see her again and if I do it won’t be for a while. 

For context, a couple of my friends who are female can’t work this out. One thinks she’s not interested and another thinks that she’s just oblivious and doesn’t realise I’m trying to get to know her. My gut tells me she’s not interested but I don’t know that was the first time I’ve properly spoken to her.  ",1,1737407072.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

We are configuring our Toast POS, and I am having some issues with our prep stations / KDS.

Here's what we have (apologies if these aren't the right terms)

\-Register/POS terminal and Printer

\-Kitchen KDS

\-Expediter KDS

\*\*\*

Pastries and coffee drinks should print at the register printer automatically, since the register person grabs the pastries before the customer leaves the reg, and passes the drink ticket to the barista, who calls out the order and set it down on the counter with the ticket. 

Prepared Food (sandwiches and bowls) should go to the Kitchen KDS and the Expediter KDS

I don't want coffee or pastries going to the Expediter or Kitchen screens since it's a lot of clutter, but unfortunately they are currently going to both. 

The register printer, which is set as the prep station for both pastries and drinks, is not automatically printing the ticket. The Toast tech, who was awesome, came and set up the printer so I don't think it's a printer configuration issue—I assume it's something that I have/haven't toggled correctly.

Take a look below.

**A hitchhiker not of this world.**

*Between Puolanka and Oulu, Northen Finland, August 1962.*

Many people around the world have reported strange and otherwordly people along the roads. Some of them have even been stopping cars and asking for a ride. This is such a report from Finland and it happened to two young men in the early 60’s.

Ilmari Karunto was a man from Helsinki who was having a road trip vacation in Northern Finland together with a friend. It was a warm, sunny day in August, and after a stop to take a swim in a lake, the two friends decided to drive from Puolanka to Oulu. When they had been driving some 50 km (31 miles) from Puolanka, Karunto, who sat beside the driver, noticed a short man, at the side of the road. He had dark loose-fitting clothes and on his head he had something that looked like a dark brown beret and on his feet was white boots. With his hands up he signaled the men to stop and asked for a ride to a forest trail 5 km (3 miles) away. Karunto moved to the back seat and they began to drive.

[The two men stopped to pick up a strange looking hitchhiker...](https://preview.redd.it/7c7cqia0m7ee1.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8ad12e593e4c52c4084c09fa2853d437ce5e112c)

In the back seat Karunto started to wonder about the appearance of the strange man they picked up. His head was larger than usual, mouth broad and thin and nose quite big. His skin had a slightly greyish tone and the eyes were black and round. And when he happened to watch the man’s eyes from the side mirror of the car, he saw to his astonishment that the man’s eyelids closed from down to up. The man seemed to notice Ilmari’s observation and put sunglasses on, and Karunto now saw that he had six, thin, grey-brown fingers. Karunto’s friend did not seem to notice anything unusual about the stranger, but Karunto was now not a little upset and asked where in Finland the man was living. This question seemed to make him thoughtfull, but then Karunto heard, like in his brain, that the stranger was not from Finland, but travelled around the world. Almost at once after this the trail came to sight and the man stepped out, thanked once again politely and began to walk along the forest trail. Karunto suggested to his friend that they should follow the mysterious man for a short moment.

When the man had walked some 50 meters (55 yards) he came to a pile of brushwood some 3 meters (10 feet) high – and jumped on top of it and ”walked”over it. *”Look, he can levitate!”*, said Karunto in awe to his friend, but they spoke yet nothing of the observation during the following car trip. Both men were very disturbed over what had just happened, but they decided to continue their journey.

After a while they heard a humming noise, which became louder. Suddenly the car's engine started to cough, then stopped altogether. When they stepped outside, they saw a large round disc shaped object, perhaps 6 meters (20 feet) in diameter, fly low over their car at 5 - 6 meters (17-20 feet), make a wide turn and then disappear from sight. When they had recovered from the shock of this sighting, they tried to turn on the ignition of their car again and it started without problem. They continued their road trip and the next day they saw a small article in a local newspaper about a light phenomenon that people had seen flying northwards.

**The mysterious hitchhiker.**

*Evijärvi, western Finland, October or November 1968.*

Helge Lindroos is a Finnish E.T. contactee and experiencer. He has been involved in several UFO sightings and encounters with aliens over the years. This is a peculiar story that happened to him when he was traveling in his car through Finland in the fall of '68 and it is another finnish story about a mysterious hitchhiker.

Helge was going to drive down to Helsinki in southern Finland from Haapajärvi and on the way there he passed through the community of Evijärvi. (anecdote: many places in Finland have ""järvi"" in their names and it means ""lake""). It was about 11 pm when he passed the village, and soon after he saw a man standing at the side of the road, and he seemed to be a completely ordinary person. However, he was quite short (170 cm/ 5.6 feet), but had a normal build and was properly dressed. Helge felt and urge to help and stopped the car and the man just jumped in without a word.

Almost as soon as they started driving, Helge Lindroos felt wierd electric vibrations through his body. The hitchhiker did not talk much and the only thing he said was: *”ILLAX*!”, and he said it out loud. This was a word Helge did not understand or what it meant. But after a while the stranger then told him that he was not from this planet, but came from outer space, and he had been visiting Mars and had then landed on Earth only a short time before. He said that there were thousands like him on Earth, but that they did not reveal themselves to all humans, since some people “are still afraid of aliens.” Helge felt a little uncomfortable now, but the mysterious man told him to relax and assured him that he meant no harm. The man then explained that they were only here to protect humanity from destruction by ourselves.

[The mysterious hitchhiker didnt say much except the strange word \\""ILLAX!\\"".](https://preview.redd.it/dtax3htfn7ee1.jpg?width=606&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=82012789ad8c0c72c116759f715fc0f2e0e30325)

At some unspecified point during the journey, the stranger asked Helge to stop the car. He parked at a rest area and the hitchhiker got out. Lindroos removed the car key and was going to get something to eat, since he got some sandwiches and a thermos of coffee in the trunk. When he stepped out of the car he saw that the stranger had vanished. Helge could see in every direction for 50 meters (55 yards) in the desolate rest area and beyond that was forest. But the hitchhiker was nowhere in sight, and the fastest sprinter in the world could not have covered the distance in just a few seconds. Helge felt very uneasy over the whole situation, and for several weeks after this encounter, he still often felt electric vibrations throughout his body and he was not himself. Helge Lindroos had a sensation that the mysterious man would one day return to meet him…

**The craft on the snowy road.**

*Timovaara, eastern Finland, December 27 1973.*

Olavi Kolehmainen from Polvijärvi was doing the night shift and was plowing the Timovaara road from snow. It was a small gravel road through the Karelian forest. When he came close to the Lipasvaara crossing at little over three o´clock in the morning, he noticed a strange steel-grey object about 4 meters wide (13 feet), which was standing on the road. The object was not emitting any light. Kolehmainen stopped his truck at a distance of 40 to 50 meters (44 - 55 Yards) and looked around to get some hint of what it was. After about a minute a hatch opened on the side of the object and against the bright light inside the object he could see first one, then two white clad, human like figures who were looking out from the opening.

[A metallic craft landed on the snowy road right in front of the man and his snow plow truck. \(credit to Jim Lawrence for adding the truck\)](https://preview.redd.it/02kwy1u0n7ee1.jpg?width=935&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a7b1b4f34cf90e022b98192fe7d7724a493bd9a7)

Kolehmainen realised this was no ordinary vehicle, and began to fear he would be abducted, as he had read in the stories, so he closed the truck’s door and waited in the cabin with a knife in his hand. (As the Timovaara road is very narrow he could not turn his truck round and escape.) Howewer, after some ten to fifteen seconds of mutual staring from him and the beings, the hatch was closed and a wining or buzzing sound could be heard. The sound became louder and some kind of smoke came from the object, after which it started to rise. The ascend continued and it vanished up on the sky towards the north. Kolehmainen listened to the object’s distancing sound for a minute and then he stepped down onto the ground and went up to the place where the object had been. Three landing marks could be seen on the snow.

**Alien ”cops” stop the car.**

*Between Ylistaro and Lapua, western Finland, October 2 1980.*

The time was 11:23 at night and a 23-year old man was driving from Vaasa towards Lapua on road 64, in order to have a late meal with friends at a local well known grill bar. When he was at the outskirts of Lapua near a small hill, he saw a bright light coming from the sky. It came closer to his position and suddenly the surroundings was lighten up and a glowing, disc-shaped, solid, object descended 10 meters (33 feet) in front of his car. The witness could not remember if he himself stopped the car or if somehow the object did it. The contours of the object were quite clear, it was a craft of some sort, and it somehow glowed and was appearing to be very hot. The craft was as broad as the road, about 6 meters (19.7 feet) and it had two white lights, one on each end of the hull, but no other details could be seen.

[Three beings from the glowing craft apporoached the witness car on the left side.](https://preview.redd.it/a8wpdty6o7ee1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d3ddae1ff40e3576b064b56cd4dee41e18ab5c0d)

The craft hovered about half a meter (1.6 feet) obove the road surface, when suddenly two lights became visible in the middle of the object and three beings stepped out. The witness described them as quite human-like, but a little smaller and shorter. He did not see any ears or hair, but the eyes were very small. The humanoids walked towards him and came up to the left side door of the car - and that was all the witness could recall of the event. The next thing he remembered was that he was driving his car into the parking lot of the grill bar, but it was already closed as four hours had passed and it was now in the middle of the night. It was not very far to the grill bar and it should not have taken four hours to drive there. What happened during the missing time the witness had no memory of.

**Abducted by Tall Whites(?) and Greys.**

*Lempäälä, south west Finland, spring 1992.*

It was a spring evening in 1992 and 18-year-old Sami Taustila from Nokia was driving on the highway through Lempäälä. He was driving from Tampere and there were very few cars on the road this evening. Suddenly he noticed two red orbs of light over a railway bridge crossing the road. Soon the two orbs were joined by two more and then they were four and they flew in a diamond-shaped formation a little bit in front of him. Sami estimated the globes to be 2 meters (6.5 feet) in diameter and they hovered at a height of approximately 20 meters (65 feet) above the ground. Then he saw that on both sides of his car were several groups of light globes, 4 red orbs in each group. Sami was obviously worried, but continued to drive. After a while the globes moved to the side of his car and flew right next to it. Sami stopped his car on the highway, but did not get out of it. That's when it happened, and he saw a blue light inside the car:

*""I don't know how it happened, but I was somehow moved outside of the car. Maybe it was done through the side window of the car? But after that there are no memories.”* Sami Taustila told a newspaper reporter who interviewed him.

[When Sami got near the railway bridge he looked up and saw two red glowing orbs in the sky ahead. \(source: YLE\)](https://preview.redd.it/ngtcyd5wo7ee1.jpg?width=1002&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bc7982520e3956bccf7a2e421e3728cf4489d64a)

When Sami woke up again, he was in his car on the highway. Almost 24 hours had passed and he had no idea what had happened during all this time. What happened during the lost hours, Sami would then find out through hypnosis 30 years later:

When Sami regained consciousness, he noticed that he was inside what appeared to be a craft. He looked around and realized he was in some sort of cockpit. But he was not alone. In front of him he saw dark shapes. His blurred vision now improved and he could see a humanoid woman in front of him. She was around 2 meters (6.5 feet) tall. She had milky white skin, long white hair and a beautiful, friendly smile. Sami noticed that she was communicating with him telepathically, for no spoken language from the mouth was used. She explains that he should not be afraid and that they come from what we humans call ""the Pleiades"" (the group of stars is also called ""the seven sisters"" and is located in the Taurus constellation 440 light years away from Earth). On a raised platform, Simo could also see three shorter gray beings with large heads and dark almond-shaped eyes. There was a lot of advanced technology and displays on the ship that Simo didn't understand.

Soon Simo felt the craft was beginning to descend and he could see a large unknown city below him. Now two other beings approached him. These two seemed to be humans like himself. “Welcome home!” they said. It seemed like they knew him or knew who he was, but Simo didn’t recognize these people.

[The Tall Greys showed Sami a lot of \\""cool stuff\\"" as he phrased it himself during an interview.](https://preview.redd.it/8uaela08p7ee1.jpg?width=858&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=51fdd75d625579fa83f70bce423ee5556bc80174)

Soon the ship arrived at a hangar in a large building and there Simo met more tall, white humanoids. Again he was assured not to be afraid and that they would not harm him. Simo was put in front of a display and they showed a lot of ""cool stuff"" in his own words. The colors on the screens were very strong and impressive. The beings then told Simo that now he must decide if he wanted to return to Earth. The other option was for the beings to take him to their home planet. The humanoids said he was one of them (?!). Simo felt a warmth and belonging from them and felt that he enjoyed being there with them, but said that he had to go home and could not leave his family on earth. Soon after this, Simo lost consciousness again, and when he woke up again, he was sitting in his car, which was on the side of the road in Lämpääla. He continued his journey to Nokia and arrived to his home and his worried parents many hours later.

Simo Taustila had thus lost a day without him knowing what had happened during all those hours. This is a phenomenon we have seen so many times before. This is a typical and classic ""Missing time"" event. And like similar cases, exciting details emerged during hypnosis. Simo has never been particularly interested in UFOs and similar paranormal phenomena and he seems to be a person with both feet on the ground. Of course, it is not out of the question that he made it all up, but he seems to be an honest person and not one to make up stories...

**The Mantis-being in the window.**

*Southern Finland, November 2016 and September 2017.*

This report came from a witness who had two strange sightings within a year. This happened while he was driving around on smaller lonely country roads in southern Finland.

Case 1:

It was an evening in November 2016 and the man was on his way to Mäntsälä. On the way there, he drove on the country road through the quiet community of Ohkolantie. Shortly after he had passed the village, he suddenly saw in the glow of the car's headlights a strange creature crossing the road in front of him. It was grey, and with a long narrow head, large eyes and long, slender legs. It ran very quickly across the road on four legs. The man was sure it was not an animal and it was like no creature he had seen before. Later he found a picture of a cryptid online that he thought was similar. When he mentioned this to his friends, it was one of them who had also seen a similar looking creature once, when he was out driving.

Case 2:

The man was out driving again. It was at dawn one morning in September 2017 and he was driving on the old country road from Jokela towards Nurmijärvi. On this stretch there was an old, abandoned house that stood right next to the road. The man often drove this road and almost always slowed down a little to look at the derelict house, and he often wondered who lived there once upon a time.

This morning the sun's rays were reflected in the window of the deserted, old house. And that's when he saw something that really scared him. Downstairs, he saw a pale gray, human-sized creature with a triangular head and enormous eyes peering out of one of the windows. As he looked at the creature, he felt its gaze bore into his mind. It was difficult to explain how it was experienced, according to the man. He sped away from the scene. The man did not dare to drive on this road for a long time afterwards. But after a while he dared to pass the old house again, and he never saw the creature more after this. According to UFO investigators, UFO phenomena had also been reported in the area around Nurmijärvi during the same time.

[An otherwordly Mantis-like creature was seen in one of the windows of the old, derelict house as the witness passed by in his car.](https://preview.redd.it/zd0v4xdrp7ee1.jpg?width=1040&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=db40a20178862fe1212f1912b1c9944605a18650)

These are two cases that make you wonder a little. What did the man actually see? Could it be that it was only animals he saw, but in the poor light and with a little vivid imagination, it turned out to be horrible creatures instead? We don't know, and according to the man, he was sure that they were not ordinary animals he saw.

SW: 368 CW:363.4 GW:225 - Height: 5'9

To preface, I've had really poor experiences in the past with weight loss attempts and always come out of it worse off mentally. So, I'm going into things this time with a ""try my best"" attitude. I'm going to be kind to myself in the process this time, but I also want to give this the best shot as possible. With the ADHD, sometimes I'll go all day without eating or drinking, so I will binge at night on dinner (I don't typically make terribly unhealthy dinners, but I will overeat at dinner and snack after) drink a bunch of soda or sweet tea. It's a problem. I know. lol 

To prepare, I've made a few changes that seem to be sustainable for me.  
I started drinking a half gallon of water with electrolytes every day, I also switched my morning Monster to Celsius or coffee mixed with an OWYN protein shake. And I've added a multivitamin, prenatel, omega 3, and vitamin D3. I've also started adding spinach into every recipe I can sneak some into and eating at minimum a salad or a protein shake around lunch. I've also switched my evening snacks to a Quest protein cookie. I already have a pretty protein-heavy diet. Overeating has always been the biggest issue, even on healthy meals. I've always had a bad relationship with food.

Not huge changes, but sustainable, and these few changes have resulted in 4.6lb loss naturally. 

I got the majority of this advice from this forum already (I've been creeping for a bit lol) My question is, what other advice do you have for prepping or starting the injections in a good place?",1,1737406927.0,HersWeightloss,0,0.99,False

My mom passed the following morning. I haven’t been the same since. I havnt done any counseling or group stuff. It’s been a year and a half now and I don’t know why I exist any more than I ever have. They left me enough money to retire, so I never went back to work. I have a 5 year old dog I inherited from my mom that I love more than anything. I also have a 20+ year old cockatiel I’ve had since middle school and he is still happy as ever but showing signs of age and having difficulty moving around his cage. I have family nearby. I have some close friends, but most of them live far away now so I don’t see them much. I feel like having a job would help me feel better, but I live alone and don’t want to leave the bird and dog alone for long hours so i don’t. My best girlfriend talks to me every day and sends me snaps. Our streak is 571 days and there’s a red heart on our chat that could turn pink soon. She broke up with her bf of 5 years over thanksgiving. She is very hurt from him ghosting and cheating on her. She is burying herself in work but also hates working. Sometimes she opens up about her feelings but it’s just a little here and there. I’ve loved her since the moment we met 6 years ago. We were coworkers tho and she met her ex shortly after us becoming friends. I let go and accepted it. I dated on my own and had some good experiences but nothing lasted. Now we havnt been coworkers in almost 2 years and she is single. All I want to do is rush in and sweep her off her feet. I’ve never been able to stop loving her. I could even support her financially and we could both not work. She is so fiercely independent though and distrustful of men and scared she’ll never want to be in a relationship again. I’ve told her I love her multiple times. She’s always said she’s happy just being friends. But then the other week I brought her coffee at work and she said she loves me. I’ve barely spent any time w her this month because she’s working so much and when she’s not she just wants to be alone w her dogs and trying to not get into drama w her family. I feel like she is flirty in general w me on snap and socials and I’ve been not hiding my love for her… sometimes I feel like I’m crazy for holding onto hope that we can be a couple. I think about her constantly. But I don’t know how to stop. I don’t want to move on. I don’t know what to do with my time day to day in general so I work out, go on hikes, watch tv, play w the dog. It gets repetitive tho and it’s depressing doing most things alone even if I’m outdoors enjoying nature. I feel trapped in some cycle where there is so much good and love I am thankful for, but there also so much in my head left unsaid for me to feel anxious and unable to sleep. I don’t know what I’m doing and why I am experiencing these things. I often don’t want to exist. But that’s not a real option. Lately I’ve been sleeping a lot, lacking motivation to go anywhere because what’s the point. I just work out to exhaustion and take care of my responsibilities. I hope I can find some kind of way forward soon.

Not Zopiclone, deep breathing, binaural beats, small snack -- nothing. 

I ripped the patch off Sunday morning and last night I slept almost eight hours. 

But today I'm sad, lethargic, headache, body aches and extremely irritable. It's the sudden drop in estrogen (I'm on Climara .75) -- obviously! And gauranteed I'm going to have a hot flash today or tomorrow.

But what do I pick? Symptom relief or sleep? 

I do drink caffeine -- two cups of green tea first thing in the morning. So maybe if I completely cut caffeine? It's hard to believe that 2 cups of green tea could be the culprit. I quit coffee and that helped a lot, so maybe? 

I don't know. 

Anyone else have sleep issues with the estrogen patch? I searched this sub and found a few threads but not a lot of responses. The wiki and Google both say that the estrogen patch is supposed to help with sleep. 

Perhaps I'm the oddball. I do have MCAS and Long COVID, and both of those syndromes can cause paradoxical drug reactions. But to hormones? I find that hard to fathom.

1i60uma,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1i60uma/chronic_mystery_illness/,Chronic Mystery Illness,"Looking for some help, thoughts, suggestions, etc.

I'm a male; 34 years old. 5 feet 10 inches. 205 pounds. Gained 35 pounds in two years, since original onset of symptoms. Back then was extremely active, ran 2-3 miles per day and went to gym 6 days per week.

Rarely leave the house now. Get winded walking up a single flight of stairs.

In 2 years, I've been to see a doctor 42 times and went to the ER 4 times. As of now, there's no diagnosis. My life has essentially been halted and it's fairly miserable.

**List of symptoms and frequency below:**  
\--High-dangerously high blood pressure, if not actively on an antibiotic. In picture below, numerous BP readings are provided. One single picture had a reasonable reading. This was while on an antibiotic. Last 3 BP readings at a hospital/physician's office are: 158/106, 162/108, 154/104  
\--Painless muscle twitches, randomly across body. Daily. In the past 6 months, I've attempted to work out 3 times. Afterwards, muscle twitches in the area I'd worked out were extremely intense.  
\--Headache. Middle of forehead. Daily.  
\--Feeling of pressure in head, distinct feeling outside of the daily headache.  
\--Frequent infections. Have had to go on an antiobiotic regimen every 6-8 weeks for well over 18 months.  
\--Feeling of sinus infections and itchy ears. Daily.  
\--Shoulder pain in both shoulders. Daily.  
\--Feeling of pressure in both hips. Daily  
\--Intense brain fog. 3-4 times per week. Toughest symptom to navigate.  
\--Can sleep for 16 hours straight or can't sleep at all for 2 days. No middle ground between the two.  
\--Feelings of panic. I've described this to doctors as ""Randomly throughout the day it suddenly feel like I'm staring eye-to-eye with a Grizzly Bear."" 2-3 times per week.  
\--Acne on face and back. Rashes behind ears, on neck, and entire belly. Prior to this health issue, had no history of acne. A dermatologist I've seen commented, ""your entire body looks inflamed""  
\--Nipples are always hard. Last 12 months or more.  
\--Inability to focus on much of anything.  
\--Brain fog led to deep depression \~4 months ago. Worked past that, once I understood what was happening. First time in my life I'd dealt with depression.  
\--Swollen and painful lymph nodes, mainly underneath arms. 1-2 weeks out of each month.  
\--Sweating more than normal and no deodorant seems to work.  
\--Bladder leakage. Daily.  
\--Lost consciousness 6 times in the past 12 months.  
\--Tachycardia: heart rate over 100bpm. Daily.  
\--Body feels heavy.  
\--Sex drive = nearly zero  
\--Have a brain cyst behind eye, but ENT said it was ""non-symptomatic""

**Other pertinent details:**  
\--Prior to health symptoms, was career motivated and active. Haven't been able to work for over 12 months.  
\--In a happy and supportive marriage.  
\--Eat healthy.  
\-Non-smoker, non-drinker, zero drug use.  
\--Diet changes haven't seemed to help. I don't drink sodas, eat sweets, fried foods, etc. I drink black coffee. One cup each morning. Tried stopping that for \~4 weeks and saw no change. 

**Medications:**   
Lisinopril  
\--Started at 10mg. Has been increased to 40mg.   


**Tests:**  
Blood Pressure: [https://ibb.co/xhGPQxK](https://ibb.co/xhGPQxK)  
\--Always high, outside of a few day period when I'm actively on an antibiotic.

Cyst: [https://ibb.co/fNMwXP6](https://ibb.co/fNMwXP6)  
\--Cyst behind eye.

Glucose, BUN, Creatinine, eGFR, BUN/Creatinine Ratio: [https://ibb.co/4WNBFmL](https://ibb.co/4WNBFmL)

1i60tv7,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1i60tv7/you_cant_fix_america_by_posting/,You can't fix America by posting,"The presidential inauguration is over. For many, this means the start of a difficult and maybe dangerous 4 years. It seems likely that all forward progress on social, financial and health issues will stop. And it will take all of our combined efforts to minimize the back sliding. Which brings me to my point, if you want things to change, you need to start participating. And most importantly:

**You can’t fix America by posting.**

Seriously, you cannot fix America by posting. Upvoting Luigi memes won’t fix the healthcare system. Retweeting snarky one liners won’t stop trump from appointing his loyalists to federal courts. Complaining about how both sides are bad and democratic leadership are impotent morons won’t change the direction of the party. If you want things to be different, you need to get involved. 

But how? 

Fair question! We often assume that you are either a victim of politics or you are a career politician who used their family's wealth to buy a senate seat and there is nothing between those two options. But that’s not true. I see a few major ways you can start getting involved right now.

1. Instead of reading posts. Start reading books and/or informational blogs. Get educated on the specific subjects that are near and dear to your heart. And keep an open mind. That doesn’t mean you should accept that maybe nazis are okay. It means you should accept that social media flattens and simplifies problems and solutions into whatever will be the most vital and fit into a single paragraph. So if someone presents a more nuanced and complex solution to a large problem, hold back the initial flinch and keep reading. And be extra critical of “let’s just” solutions. Complex problems have complex solutions, only salesmen offer simple solutions.
2. Instead of posting, start emailing the members of your local/state government. Figure out who represents you. Are you in a city? Are you sure you aren’t just next to the city but actually in an unincorporated county? Who is your state rep and senator? What leadership roles do they have? Email them, call them, ask to meet for coffee. Figure out when they are doing town halls. I was at a town hall recently and I was one of 3 people under the age of 40 in a packed room. If you don’t feel like your representatives are actually representing you, it’s probably because gen x, millennials and gen Z aren’t showing up and participating. “Should my reps do what’s best for me without me having to ask and pressure them?” Yes, but they don’t. So let’s play the game rather than just complaining about the rules. They are more accessible than you think. They are just dentists that work for the government two or three times per month.
   1. Also your govt has full time employees like planners engineers and city managers. Talk to them too. They work at the behest of the elected officials. So ask them “what would it take to get bike lanes?” And they might tell you that we need to county commissioners to ask for explicitly and add budget for it. Great now you know who to talk to next.
3. Be nice. This part sucks. Because you probably want to show up to a meeting of your local party chapter and throttle them and yell and call them idiots. That will feel great but get you and your cause nowhere. That doesn’t mean you can’t be serious and forceful and pressure your elected officials. But complaints and threats of recall and general vitriol, won’t get them to agree with you. Start talking to everyone you can and see what you can do to support the good ideas and downplay the bad ones. Standing outside the capital with a cardboard sign is far less effective than building relationships with the people inside the building. There is a time and place for protests but protests alone won’t make changes 
4. Find friends. Here is the one place where social media can be useful. It’s hard to do this work on your own. It’s long and tedious and it’s much more tolerable if you have help. Find a local group of advocates. There is none? start a local group. Put out the word on social media and say something like “do you want safer bike facilities in our city? Meet me on the first Friday of the month at this coffee shop and let’s talk about it. 
5. Direct action. The most direct way to make a change is to start doing it. Do wish there was someone on the planning commission that would support townhomes? Apply. Do you wish your city council would take certain issues more seriously? Run for office. Do you wish the Democratic Party would choose better leaders and issues? Go to meetings and run for leadership roles. Millennials don’t hold as much political power because we aren’t taking it. “But I don’t have time!”
6. You probably do have time. Yes. A lot of young people work a lot and have kids and don’t have a spare hour each month. But let’s not kid ourselves. That is not how most of us are. We aren’t broke kids anymore. We just arent willing to make the initial sacrifices to make time for political action. Some people reading this genuinely don’t have the time or energy to participate. If that’s you then you know who you are. But I’m willing to guess that most people that have the time and inclination to read an embarrassingly long and earnest post on Reddit, actually do have the time to attend a city council and give 3 minutes of public comment. And if you have the time to write a snarky reply about how you don’t have time, then you actually do have enough time to write an email to your state rep.

We can enact change but it takes work. But the more people that get involved and start pushing in the same direction the easier it will get. I can’t guarantee that the steps that I played out will get you the outcome you want but I can guarantee that posting won’t get you results. Many of us are old enough to have been adults during the last trump presidents. We probably remember for four years there was an avalanche of snarky tweets about trump and how dumb he is and how bad he is. Every SNL skit. Every stand up routine. Every meme. Every gotcha article and lie exploded on every social media platform. And in the end, none of it made a difference and we have a second term with trump. So save your breathe. Save your energy. Deny musk and Zuck the engagement. Take your energy off of social media and put it into building real world power.

\---

My (27F) grandma (80F) and grandpa (85M) were married for like 50 years. They met as teens and were married up until my Grandma died in 2021. There were mixed reactions across both my families, but it was really hard for my Dad (60M) specifically. He's never not seen them together, so he's been going to therapy ever since to cope.

Apparently, while my Grandpa was visiting my Grandma in her hospice care in 2021, he became close with her nurse, Sarah (24F). Somehow, Sarah the hospice nurse introduced my Grandpa to Paulette (80F), her grandmother. We still have no idea how he met Paulette and he won't share. There was a big, BIG, series of family arguments surrounding her starting a relationship with my Grandpa in 2022, and being included in family events. My grandpa then moved Paulette into his own home and let Sarah’s mother (one of Paulette’s daughters) rent the house he owned next door to his own. Sarah, her mother, and two other siblings all live next door now. According to him, they were being priced out of their apartment and weren’t renewing and needed a place to stay. My father vehemently hates Paulette and her family, my mother and Paulette openly argue sometimes, they're barely cordial. My brother is a neutralist to the core, and even he largely dislikes her and is vocal about it.

I think my family’s main worry is my Grandpa being taken advantage of. All of my family consistently describes Paulette and her family as gold diggers. There is a lot of tension from various mid-level altercations ( I can elaborate on those in the comments) to the point that my family is operating kind of hands off with my Grandpa. He's sad because my Mom, Dad, and brother all call and bring him stuff at different periods/schedules, but they never stop, hang out, and shoot the shit like they used to because Paulette will come out and then things get awkward, and he notices.

This is where I come in. I moved in with my Grandpa at the end of December of 2024 after he invited me to live with him and now I have started seeing all this stuff first hand. I’m kind of mad at him and myself because I feel like he wanted me to live with him to validate his relationship. I think he thought if I approved, it would smooth things over on both sides ….but I don’t like her either 😭😭 I set out to be open minded about getting to know Paulette because I know how judgemental my family can be, but….she just grosses me out, mostly.

She's very different from us, like she couldn't be more different tbh. I think it was kinda inevitable and unfortunate. I don't know how to explain it but the best way to put it is as a perfect  class-mismatch. All of my family thinks her family is ghetto and uncouth 🥲😂. And they think we’re bougie and stuck up. We all have different values. Paulette's addicted to cigarettes and coffee, which my Dad hates because my Grandpa just got over pneumonia. She leaves messes around the house (My mom’s biggest pet peeve), doesn’t clean, is unhygenic, inconsiderate (she and I share an adjoining bathroom, where I get the pleasure of listening to her shit her heart out 4 times a day), has numerous health complications, and looks homeless all the time. She completely depends on my Grandpa for meals, entertainment, social circles. Where as my Grandma was the life of the party and had an appointment to keep for every hour. My Grandma had class. It’s a very stark difference.

I’ve done my absolute best to stay out of my Grandpa’s relationship. He always wants to talk to me about Paulette and her family problems (she’s estranged from most of her family and friends, surprise surprise) and  I’ve pulled him aside twice now and reminded him gently but plainly that while I’m happy he has someone, me and her won’t ever be close and we don’t have to be. I’ve been abundantly clear, but I know he’s not listening to me. He thinks I’ll come around later on and keeps trying to manufacture instances for Paulette and myself to talk or hang out. If I ask to do any kind of activity or spend time with him, he always wants to include Paulette.

Am I an asshole for not wanting to get involved? I genuinely want nothing to do with Paulette, because I have my own issues with my family and I don’t need this added on. Plus she's not my family. I'll never see her that way. I also don’t like being forced to be friends with someone just because someone wants me to. I don’t need my Grandpa picking friends for me 😭 He keeps asking me to hang out with Sarah and I’m just like…no. Sorry if that was long.

I appreciate reading about the experience of others and the valuable insights offered. I am hopeful for so many things as I start this new journey, but mostly the notion of not thinking every moment of every day about food, the negative aspects of my weight, and how much I’ve gained over the past several years. I feel that these thoughts consume me even though I have been exercising regularly and eating fairly healthily for quite some time now, only to see a drop of no more than five pounds despite trying hard to improve my habits and move the scale. I have a several questions in mind at the moment. 1) Due to the potential muscle loss on Zepbound, I would like to try and have 30 grams of lean protein with each meal. Does that seem reasonable given the decrease in appetite that occurs? 2) Second, I cook dinner for my family most nights and, in addition to having general dinner fatigue, I am curious how being on this medicine will impact this part of my life. My family is interested in eating healthy dinners but perhaps not to the extent I will be doing so. Any advice on how to balance ongoing meal preparations for the family while adhering to what I need to do for my own weight loss journey? I have thought about making lean proteins and veggies for everyone, plus (for example) rice, potatoes, or pasta depending on the night for those who want that with their meal. 3) I plan to continue my normal workout routine which consists of walking at least a mile a day, five days a week. Weights three days a week and core work two days a week. I am hoping to be able to continue/enhance this exercise regimen once I start on Zepbound. Does that seem reasonable? 4) What about drinking coffee? Does that worsen the digestive issues that occur for people? Is tea a better option?

Breakfast: a quarter of a veggie, cheese, meat omelette, small cup of berries, coffee with oat milk 
Lunch: 3 hard shell tacos with shredded chicken mixed with grilled veggies, handful of lite shredded cheese & Greek yogurt, small cup of chicken broth
Snack: coffee with protein powder and a chia pudding

I’m now at 111g protein, 27g of fiber and 1562 calories so need to have a very low caloric high protein dinner.

Pro hint: Single rider line at Matterhorn is the way. Morning and evening crowds were surprisingly chill!

So there we were MLK weekend, my family buzzing excitedly as we walked through those gates at rope drop. The plan? Ride everything we could, build some droids, and maybe snag a lightsaber. Spoiler alert: we did all that and more!

First, can we talk about how surreal it is running through an empty park at rope drop? We hit Space Mountain right as the sun was coming up, and I swear there's nothing quite like that first drop in the dark to wake you up! The morning was just pure magic - we knocked out Big Thunder and Rise of the Resistance before most people had finished their morning coffee.

Speaking of Rise... wow. Just wow. It's my third time riding it and still leaves me speechless. The way the Cast Members stay in character, the scale of everything - it's just next level. My youngest was utterly convinced the First Order was actually capturing us!

The real highlight, though? Galaxy's Edge. Look, I might have dragged my family back there a *few* too many times (sorry, not sorry, family!), but come on - when you've got a chance to build droids and hang out in Oga's Cantina, you take it! We ended up building two droids because one just wasn't enough. My wife and eldest were rolling their eyes at our third visit, but hey, the Force was calling!

Funny story - while we were waiting for Indiana Jones (which kept playing hard to get all day), my youngest started this deep philosophical debate about whether Roger Rabbit was actually a good guy. Nothing like Disney to get kids thinking about moral complexity! We finally got on Indy late in the evening, and holy cow, what a ride! Definitely worth the wait, even if we had to try a few times throughout the day to catch it open.

Some random incredible moments:
- Mickey & Minnie's Runaway Railway has this hilarious ""costume museum"" in the queue that had us cracking up
I found out my kid is a natural pilot on Smugglers Run (though we couldn't quite pull off ""Chewie mode"" without a full crew)
I absolutely crushed it on Buzz Lightyear (500,000 points, not that I'm bragging... and I know, I know, it’s only rank 3… but I TOTAL ranked 68 overall, I’m guessing for the park that day)
- Scored a Cal Kestis lightsaber! The shopkeeper at Dok-Ondar's really got into character with that sale
- hats off to the server in Oga’s Cantina for the award of the most in character. “ I hear there’s something called guacamole on your planet; it’s a closer proximation to that. “￼￼￼

The crowds were actually pretty manageable—busy during the middle of the day, sure, but surprisingly chill in the morning and evening. We hit 19 rides total, which feels kind of crazy looking back. Single rider lines were the clutch, especially for Matterhorn. We are definitely keeping that trick in our back pocket for next time!

We wrapped up the night with a sunset ride on Jungle Cruise (our skipper was on fire with the dad jokes) and one last walk through Batuu to pick up our droids and lightsaber. Walking down Main Street at night, arms full of Star Wars gear and completely exhausted, was pretty much the perfect ending.

10/10 would let my family judge me for my Star Wars obsession again. Does anyone else have some Galaxy's Edge stories to share? Or am I the only one who could spend all day there?

Asiago bagel sandwich with half an avocado, ~2 tablespoons of cream cheese, 2 eggs, a couple tomato slices, and lettuce. 

Siggi’s coconut yogurt with a couple of blackberries and raspberries (the container says it is 150 cal).

I have been to a number of doctors but the functional doctor told me a couple of interesting things.

Some of my hormones are low and my insulin resistant marker says ""high"" or 53 (using LabCorp for bloodwork) and my A1C is 5.5.

I got a couple of glucose monitors to keep track of that and I have made good progress learning more about my body—no more white flour, rice, etc.

Now, my *functional neurologist* said it is **definitely the adrenals**.

I was feeling pretty good even could even drink regular coffee even though I always felt it was not really helping.

One day 3 weeks ago I went to get a cup of ""decaf"" that ended up giving me a weird, horrible feeling that sent me home where I just basically had to rest until I was able to do anything.

From that day forward, I have not been feeling as good. It is mainly my head: pressure (constant), anxiety, and just a feeling like I cannot do what I am about to do (work, cooking, anything)—it is hard to explain.

This coffee episode seems to have really exacerbated my adrenals to a point I feel worse than I was feeling on a daily basis (things start feeling good towards the afternoon, so I think this is, probably, cortisol and adrenaline (?) going down until the next day.

I am here to get more clarity on what others are feeling so I can compare and see what else I can do.

*NOTE: I have been taking ashwaganda on and off for the past 1 week and my functional neurologist wants to put me in a master hormone (forget the name, I think it starts with A).

Back in June, I met an amazing girl. We hit it off instantly—talking, FaceTiming, and even watching anime together. Unfortunately, it was long-distance since she returned to her home state a week after we met.

In the beginning, everything felt great. We talked about love, intimacy, and the future. She supported me (though I supported her more) and she even did an “analysis” of our connection, saying, “I think we’d be a good match if we work on communication.” I replied, “You think we’d make a good match, but I know we’d make a good match.” I wanted her to feel excited, loved, and appreciated; which she was in that moment. 

A month into our connection, she told me she really likes me but didn’t think we were compatible and wanted to end things. I was shocked because this was the same person who said she missed me, sent me songs that reminded her of me, and FaceTimed to share her day. She explained she didn’t feel valued because I hadn’t done certain things (like sending her flowers, coffee, or small acts of service). I admitted I had held back to guard myself but apologized, saying I’d have been happy to do those things if she’d communicated her needs earlier. I told her, “I really like you, and I want this to work because I genuinely care about you and our connection. I love you.”

To show her I was serious, I started making thoughtful gestures—sending flowers while she was studying. We also planned to meet in California during her break. But before that happened, she grew distant again and said, “I can’t give you what you want. You deserve someone better.” I reassured her, “Just because you can’t go on a trip doesn’t mean I don’t want you or this can’t work.” I changed my flight plans and decided to visit her city instead.

When we finally met, it was amazing, even though we only spent two days together. We went on dates, held hands, cuddled, and shared intimate moments like me kissing her forehead, massaging her shoulders, and letting her rest in my lap. She told me, “I had an amazing night with you,” which made everything worth it. I also wrote her a heartfelt love letter, something she said no one had ever done for her before.

But three days after I got home, she ended things again, saying she couldn’t do it anymore. This time, I accepted her decision but didn’t tell her how heartbroken I was. She had become my everything, but as a man, I felt I couldn’t show that vulnerability.

A week or two after the breakup, I reached out because I missed her. We kept the conversations light, but she stopped responding like she began to. Two months later, I asked her how her winter break was going. She replied but then asked me how I was doing in a way that offended me, like I was nothing and what we had was nothing. I felt hurt by her tone, so I called her out. She then opened up, saying she was depressed and added, “You don’t need to be nice to me.” I replied, “I’m not going to change how I feel about you or how I treat you.”

She started sharing more about her personal struggles (which I won’t detail here). I responded with a long, caring message, letting her know she had someone who supports and loves her. I said, “I will always be that person because I love you.” Her response was a simple, “Thank you.” After that, she didn’t reply for two days.

Later, she apologized, saying, “I’m sorry for making you feel unwanted. I genuinely care about you.” Our conversations became lighter again, and I thought we were back on track. In December, I sent her a Christmas care package of items which showed my love, care, and effort for her. She seemed excited and happy, but by the end of the month, she ghosted me…again. 

It hurt because I’d done everything to make her feel loved—traveling to see her twice, being vulnerable, and fighting for us. It felt like the person who once wanted this as much as I did now saw me as a bother.

I started learning about attachment styles and realized she likely has a dismissive-avoidant attachment style. She’s only ever been in “situationships,” and I told her early on, “I’m not trying to be one. I want a relationship with you.” But it seems we fell into a situationship despite my efforts.

Even though I’ve fought so hard, I still love her. She’s told me, “No one’s ever done these cute and romantic things for me before,” and I believe my love may have overwhelmed her at times. She once said I was making her feel “anxious,” even though she also appreciated my gestures and made it seem like she wanted that. 

Now, I’m torn. My brains telling me to move on, but my heart still yearns for her. Lately, she’s been liking my TikTok reposts about love—something she’s never done before. Is this breadcrumbing? I’ve been avoiding her stories on Snapchat and Instagram, but every few days, she interacts with my reposts.

Has anyone been in a similar situation? 
Do you think she might ever come back, miss me, think of me, or want to rekindle things?

A lot of us in these hobbies probably need excuses to leave the house anyway...

Maybe meet up at a brewery or coffee shop, see a movie at the Kentucky, group shop at Half Price Books, that sort of thing.  I'm up for suggestions!

Here's the Discord link, it's very bare bones right now because I'd eventually like to tailor it to the needs of the community...  Once I find them.

[Here's the invite link](https://discord.gg/dqYEBRGmYp)

Have a good day and stay warm!

If there's already an existing community covering these things I'd love to join but my searches came up empty so I'm seeing if there's interest in starting one.",7,1737404786.0,lexington,0,1.0,False

Having lots of relationship history with intimacy. Personally I don't have intimacy experience on purpose and I don't want someone with lots of experience/relationship history. Also if you broke up recently that's also a big no for me.

I'm 6.1 - 185cm muscular build, (not too shredded) wide shoulders, white skin, black hair, eyes and beard ( I don't like having a long beard so I keep it short or shave ) . You can see me from the link below.

I'm from Turkey and my ethnicity is Caucasian.

My personality type is INFP-A , I don't believe horoscopes or any religion.

I'm a Concept/2D Artist. I draw character designs, potraits, any stuff I like.

I'm loyal, empathetic, protective, dependable and love to share every thought I have with my partner and also expect the same thing.

I love melancholy in general, I have couple of sad song playlists on Spotify.

My main hobbies are drawing, powerlifting and gaming. I also do some other stuff like playing electric guitar sometimes but who cares.

I like getting and giving attention in equal terms.

Lightning Source used to be great about 10 years ago.

After 17 years with them, we are currently stuck and unable to order books because their billing system is broken.  New orders skip the billing screen and then the order goes into limbo.

My business partner suspects they either got hacked or are about to go out of business because of the unprofessional manner in which they are operating.  I am seeing similar complaints in the Google Reviews for Lightning Source.  I am guessing at this point this is never going to get resolved, so we are jumping ship.

We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.



* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

Anyway, it comes and I take a huge gulp and instantly I knew. My mouth covered in a fine layer of fat, it tasted like pus. 

I asked the waitress to confirm and she was like ahh yehh that’s definitely oat and waved her receipt. 

My friend took a sip and she immediately confirmed my suspicions (hard not to) and the waitress just left. 

I sat on it for a hot minute and then my friend called another waitress.. who also tried to gaslight me, then took it away with an eye roll. 
Finally got the oat milk. 

The point of this post, I’ve been so disappointed that I had milk albeit a small amount. 
I’ve been vegetarian for 8+ years and 100% vegan since start of December. 

Would you ‘re-set’ the date? 

Also why would cafes think it’s fine to gaslight people on this? 

EDIT: I’m a very rigid person with OCD, so if a rule is broken by me, I can spiral and have a lot of self disapproval. I know it wasn’t my fault, but my ‘rule of being a true vegan’ has been ruined if you get my drift. 
I celebrate small milestones for anything I do, so that’s why I have a date thing. X

2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.



* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.

1i5zwdd,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1i5zwdd/unemployed_girlfriend_wants_me_to_take_her_to_air/,Unemployed girlfriend wants me to take her to air bnbs. ,"So I'm starting to get super annoyed with my girlfriend being unemployed for four months, yet still wanting me to pay for experiences that are expensive. She tries looking for work to an extent (my mum cleaned toilets to put food on the table when she needed too, so I do have pretty firm beliefs about doing whatever you can to bring money into to afford things), and opening up a graphic design business which has no income yet. 

We've been together for a year, lived together for a while then I decided I needed to move out because she was unemployed and the mutual financial situation we both fundamentally disagreed on, causing conflicts as I couldn't support her the way she wanted which ended in one of us swearing or yelling. 
Her view was we had a shared income because we lived together and were partners.  
My view was she was my girlfriend, I'd do my best to support her financially, with what I could, however wasn't ready for a shared account style of relating together.  
Since then, I have tried to explain my budget, my overheads etc. She likes drinking a coffee everyday (7 dollars) even though she's unemployed, and didn't have a license when I met her, so I taught her to drive, have been buying her coffees and try and take her out to a nice dinner when I can. Other than that, I take her camping because I can afford that and we like the outdoors, and I cover all the food costs when she's with me and always pay for petrol since the start of our relationship. I've also created an account with $250 which is allocated to my food (100-130 weekly), and then we discuss how we'd like to allocate the leftover 120-150 - which is usually on her and I getting a shared coffee or drink.

These efforts don't seem enough as she has now vocalised that ""I want you to take me to a romantic air bnb because it will make me feel special"". 
I tried to explain I'd love to do that with her, however would find it hard to afford while we're relying on a single income to do leisure activities together. She then said I was blaming her. 
I said we could save the 100-150 money for an air bnb, and that having a dual income would help save that moneys for nice experiences. 

Conversations about financial challenges and her being unemployed are pretty off limits, she has a lot of shame and tells me she feels blamed when I speak to her about it, or try to vocalise my frustration, so I'm feeling super stuck and also annoyed that she's asking for me to take her to air bnbs when I already am spending and doing so much for her, while she's unemployed.  I don't feel there's a reciprocal input financially and dont want to invest more money until she has a job. 
I love her and she's great in many ways, so I don't wish to demoralise her in this conflict.

1i5zsgh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1i5zsgh/my_partner_is_controlling_unintentionally/,"My partner is controlling, unintentionally manipulative, and has a short fuse. Can this ever change?","In the most simple and objective way I can put it; she has a short fuse and was socialized in a toxic/manipulative family. I am scared of setting her off, and therefore can’t communicate. We cannot continue this way and I don’t see how it can be fixed. 

3 major events have happened. It is more or less the same issue. As condensed as possible:
1. I plan bar with friends. She doesn’t like. Evolved from she wants to hangout to not trusting me enough to go to the bar (in the past she and I have gone alone to bars) then ghosting me and texting my friend instead. Next day I explained how I felt; controlled, manipulated, mistreated. Conversation ended in us having a break. 
2. Many minor issues hurting me and her being in a general bad/depressed mood for about 2 weeks. We had a conversation where I explained how I felt; controlled, unappreciated, mistreated, and manipulated. I communicated how I was going to confront her in the future if I felt any of the above and that it would certainly cause problems. 
3. I hired a tutor for organization. It’s fairly intense, I had them make a full everyday schedule for the university semester. I suggested going for coffee to my partner so she can meet said tutor and understand my relationship with them. She refused and broke down.  Simplified, she said it was because I didn’t give her the chance to organize me first. She is livid I have the tutor, that it is affecting her life too, and that I didn’t communicate my schooling and tutor planning with her beforehand.  I communicated; I was in the wrong for not communicating openly, and for not giving her a chance to organize me first. We came to the conclusion; I couldn’t communicate because I was scared of her short fuse. She has trauma that she cannot control. Finally, that this issue needs to be solved. She did not agree that this is relatively the same problem we have always had.  

From my perspective it’s a recurring problem that she doesn’t comprehend. I feel like I’ve given her 3 chances and she can’t change her ways. I haven’t been able to change my side of the problem either. I don’t know what else can be done. 

I love her, but part of her scares me. I can’t communicate and stand up for myself because of this fear/anxiety. Is there a way that her or I can understand ourselves better and then change ourselves to solve this problem?",0,1737404043.0,Advice,1,0.5,False

Hey everyone! 👋

I’m Mohamed, 34, based in Cairo. I work as a freelance producer, mostly in the Esports scene (if you’re into gaming, hit me up!). Recently, I wrapped up producing the biggest Esports show in history, which was an incredible experience.

Outside of work, I’m into walking (I’ve been using a walking pad lately and love it!), trying to stay active after years of being a couch potato. 😅 I’m also a big fan of coffee, tech, and gaming. Bonus points if you can beat me at Beat Saber or want to geek out about VR! 🎮

Personality-wise, I’d say I’m thoughtful, spontaneous, and open-minded. I’ve been on a journey of self-improvement and reflection, and I’m big on meaningful conversations and growth. Oh, and I have a fluffy Persian cat named Yukkie who’s the boss of the house. 🐾

Looking for someone kind, curious, and full of good vibes. Whether it’s gaming together, deep talks, or just exploring the city, I’d love to get to know you.

Feel free to drop a message if this sounds like your vibe! 😊",0,1737403839.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,0.5,False
