I don’t really know how to begin. It’s been kind of hard gathering my thoughts about the incident since it happened several years ago. Trying to tell friends or family never really helped, and even speaking with my therapist didn’t help much either. So you guys are my last resort to try and hopefully make sense of this whole thing. 

I was around 18 when it happened. Just graduated high school and had all the time in the world to do whatever the hell I wanted. I was, and still am, super big into wildlife and nature photography. Was just kind of a little hobby I picked up on after my sister gave me a Nikon D3500 as a late birthday gift. Before I just used my crappy hand-me-down smartphone to get some pictures, messing with filters and whatnot and posting them to my old Instagram account. Anyway, I decided to take a trip by myself and my dog at the time to a state park near me in Illinois. This was my first mistake.

Now, I haven't been to this state park in years. I remember going on a family outing there to hike and spend some quality time together. But that’s when weird things started happening. I think I got separated from my parents and sister at one point. As I was walking through the trails, I got a little light-headed. It was sometime during summer so I had just assumed I was getting too hot. I took a second and sat down underneath a tree to collect myself. 

Then, I distinctly remember seeing a person standing on top of a cliffside, staring down at me. I couldn’t make out any recognizable features, only that it was maybe a woman. I passed out. Next thing I knew, I woke up in the family car, heading back home.

My parents didn’t know what happened, they just thought I had gotten lost and passed out from heat exhaustion. I thought that too. But that woman that I saw always lingered in the back of my mind, and ever since, I had these odd nightmares. Visions of death and decay, almost like how the seasons change and the plant life begins to wither away. It scared the hell out of me. But they weren’t common enough to cause concern, to me at least. That’s also when I noticed this longing to return, an odd pull at the base of my neck, like softly pulling on the string of a package. 

It was a crisp autumn morning. The leaves all changed from a verdant jade green to beautiful bright oranges, reds, and yellows. A slight breeze carried the fallen leaves across the streets, almost as if they were dancing. The earthy scent of decaying leaves wafted through the air. I woke up at an early 6 AM (which was way too early for a teenager who never woke up before 8 AM), took my dog outside in the backyard while I made a cup of coffee. Her name was Holly, and she honestly was the best dog I have ever had. She was a beautiful Czech shepherd, with a mostly tan coat with white and black markings. I only say “was” because she died of cancer a few years later (nothing happened to her on this day, thank god). Holly never was your stereotypical “crazy, intense, and hyper” shepherd like most people think. She loved snuggling and lounging around the house. We really got super lucky with her, not being a very active family. Which always makes me wonder: why did I even go out and do this in the first place?

I finished making my coffee. I stared as the dark liquid streamed into my travel mug, almost getting lost in a trance from how tired I was, but I quickly snapped out of it. I brought Holly back inside and got her hooked up on her harness and leash, packed up my camera, and quickly told my parents my plan for the day. I would be going out to get some pictures at a state park a few hours away. They seemed confused as to why I would be going. Normally I just stay around town and snap pictures of local wildlife, Cardinals, Mourning Doves, and any deer I rarely come across. But, I just had some feeling, like a soft gravitational pull to go out there. I just brushed them off, saying something like “I just want to.” I didn’t have a specific reason.

I gathered all of my things: my backpack, camera, coffee, granola bars and some water and threw it all in the passenger seat of my ‘08 silver Chevy Impala. I fucking loved that car. It always had problems but man the stereo in that car was so sweet. I loved blasting metal through them and just driving for hours. I miss that rust bucket. Holly eagerly jumped into the back seat and we set off for the state park.

I had some time to myself (and Holly too) before we got there. I was trying to think of what I wanted to photograph. I hadn’t been to this state park in some years, maybe back in 2009 was the last time? I’m not sure. But I do remember there being this beautiful waterfall cascading out from a cliff face. That was the main attraction, and the reason people went there. I knew I wanted some shots of that, but felt like I could do better. I think there was a cliff that overlooked a massive forest. I could get some pics of that too. Animals aren’t all that common there since there’s typically a lot of foot traffic but I was hoping to see some different birds. Maybe a Common Nighthawk, or even a Cooper’s Hawk (one of my personal favorites).

During my drive, I started thinking: “why do I even want to go?” I hadn’t been there in years. Yet here I am, driving down there on a random weekday, with just my dog and my camera. That slight, almost minute pull I’ve been feeling. Almost like something is tugging at the base of my skull, telling me I have to go to the state park.

That there’s something I need to see.

I don’t know what it is, don’t know where, and still don’t know why. 

After driving for about an hour or so, I realized I never had breakfast. I pulled off to a diner and decided to grab a quick bite to eat. Thankfully they had a drive thru so I didn’t have to get out of the car. I pull up to the window, ask for a breakfast burrito and some hash browns, and pull into one of the parking spots so I could eat. I pulled out my phone to check my messages but the reception out there was so bad it wasn’t loading anything. Oh well. I rolled down my window and decided to people-watch. I remember getting some odd looks, mainly from older men in their trucks. Seeing a long-haired masculine person with painted black nails and a nose piercing was probably the closest thing to seeing an alien was to them, I was used to that though, growing up in a mostly rural area of Illinois, I’d always get weird looks.

As I was sitting there, eating my burrito and sharing some of my hash browns with Holly, a guy in a beat-up red pickup truck pulled up beside me. I don’t really know cars, but after looking it up, I think it was some old ford f-150 or something. The thing was rusted to hell, missing a side mirror, and the oddest thing, it had these long, deep gash marks across the side of it, almost like someone had taken a knife and cut through it as if it were made of butter. He parked next to me and I got a better look at the guy. He was mid to late 70’s, maybe 80’s, I'm not too sure, with a yellow-ish white beard that just went past his neck. His piercing green eyes staring back at me through small, cracked glasses that rested on the end of his nose. He scowled at me for a few seconds, and I just stared right back at him. He then broke the silence, speaking in a gruff, almost smoker-like voice:

“You ain’t from ‘round here, boy?”

“No.” I replied, a little hiccup in my voice could be heard.

“Well, whatchu doin’ here then? We don’t take well to your ‘kind’.”

“Your kind”? The hell does he mean by that?

“Just going out to the state park to get some pictures.” I’m now starting to get a little unnerved by the guy, I just wanted some breakfast!

The man didn’t respond for a few seconds. He looked like he was thinking. I took this opportunity to get a look inside his truck. I saw his interior was also torn up, like the outside of his truck. Sitting next to him in the passenger seat was a firearm (I don’t know guns, just kind of looked like a hunting rifle). Normally, I wouldn’t think much of it, this guy seems like a hunter. But with the state of his truck and how weird he’s being, some alarms were going off in my head.

“Well, just be careful. There’s been some reports of people goin’ missin’ up in them woods. If I were you, I’d be turnin’ back now, while y’ still can.” There was an almost eerie tone to his voice, like he was trying to warn me. But after the “your kind” comment, I didn’t really care about what he had to say.

“Alright, well thanks for the advice.” I say, stuffing down the rest of my breakfast. The guy just stared back, as if he was trying to bore holes into my skull with his eyes. Eventually, he pulled out and left as quickly as he came.

What a weird ass guy. I thought to myself. I looked back at Holly and she was sitting up in the backseat, staring towards the diner. I called out her name, but she didn’t move. I went to pet her and she snapped out of it. She seemed a little anxious. Weird. What that guy said got me thinking, and so I decided to do some amateur detective work. I hopped out of my car, grabbed Holly and went to the outdoor seating area at the diner to ask some questions. I saw an older woman drinking a cup of black coffee out of a cute porcelain mug, she seemed nice enough. As I was walking towards her, I noticed her eyes, swiftly darting between me and Holly. 

“Hi, I just had a few questions. I haven’t been out here in some time and was wondering who that guy was in that beat up red truck?”

The woman, maybe in her late 60’s, sat her cup down and looked up at me with warm, brown eyes that mirrored her coffee. Her white hair slowly cascading down to her shoulders. She had an odd familiarity about her, but I couldn’t pinpoint it.

“That was Reggie. He’s kind of an odd guy, always goin’ around town hootin’ and hollerin’ ‘bout how the government is lyin’ and that they puttin’ microchips and whatnot in our brains to turn us into a zombie army or whatever. Most folk here don’t pay him much mind, but when he finds someone he don’t recognize, he’ll sure as hell try to freak ‘em out.”

Yeah, that makes sense, he seemed crazy. I’m all for conspiracy theories but that’s a bit much.

“Okay, and he said something about people going missing up at the state park down the road, what did he mean by that?”

The woman got really quiet. She took a sip of her coffee, set it back down, and looked deep into her mug.

	

“Oh, he was prolly just tryin’ to scare ya. You seem like a capable man, I wouldn’t worry too much ‘bout it.” She gave a soft and warm smile, her teeth stained yellow from years of coffee and probably smoking.

I thanked her for her time and walked back to my car. She sounded genuine about her last statement, but her facial expressions and body language gave off the feeling that she was scared, or worried. As I started my car back up again and looked up, the woman was staring right at me. I gave her a smile and a wave but she just stared back, motionless and expressionless. I felt like her gaze would swallow me whole.

I drove down a winding road, through leafless trees with the dying leaves flowing behind my car. Eventually, I made it to the parking area, pulled into a spot and began to gather my things. It’s around 8 AM at this point, and there were a few other cars around. Nothing out of the ordinary, people come here a lot to hike or exercise. I got out and felt the cool autumn breeze rush past me. It’s soothing, lifting the worries I had on my drive here away. I let Holly out and take her off leash. She’s really good about staying with me and I keep the leash on me, ready to attach it in case another dog comes. I take my camera out of my bag and begin snapping some photos of the area, testing the lens and making sure I have the settings right. 

One of the cars in the lot looks familiar. It’s Reggie’s truck, banged up and scratched to all hell. It's pretty recognizable so I know for a fact that he’s here. I snapped a few pictures of it. I’m not really sure why, maybe because of how weird our conversation was. I do notice something odd about it though. When I made my way up to it, I noticed that his gun, which was sitting in the passenger seat next to him, was gone. That made me uneasy, an old guy walking around a forest trail with a whole ass rifle? But I dunno, maybe there’s some back trails that he uses for hunting. At least I hoped.

As I begin to walk towards the main trail, I feel a rush of uneasiness wash over me, like a wave of freezing cold water. I stare down the path with the trees arching over it, like a monstrous maw about to devour me whole. Then a pair of joggers walk past me, talking about their run this morning. That snaps me out of my daze that I was trapped in, and I quickly shrug it off. My mind is telling me to drop everything and leave, that I shouldn’t be here. But I want to do this, I need to. And so, I begin to take my first steps onto the trail.

It’s a pretty nice walk. It’s paved in most areas, a pretty easy trail for practically anyone. Like I said, I'm no avid hiker or outdoorsman so I knew this wouldn’t be too taxing on me. Holly is trotting around, sniffing around for anything to investigate. Every so often a person or two will walk past me, and Holly stops to say hi. She’s such a glutton for attention, but she is pretty cute so I can’t blame anyone for wanting to say hi.

I eventually made it to the waterfall I spoke of earlier. The white water cascading down the rocky cliffside, forming a massive pool of clear blue water in the basin. It really is beautiful, especially at this time of year. The blues and whites from the water pairing nicely with the oranges and yellows of the autumn leaves. Nobody else is here, which is kind of odd, especially with the amount of cars that were in the parking lot. This area is a lot bigger than the paths so I let Holly walk around a little farther from me. I take out my camera and begin getting some pictures of the waterfall and the surrounding area. Kneeling down on a rock off to the side, I aim the camera near the basin. Click! Though that wasn’t the sound of the camera shutter, it sounded like a rifle being cocked. I look up from out of my camera’s viewfinder and see Reggie, all the way at the top of the waterfall. Looking down at me, gun in hand.

	

“Holy shit, you scared the hell out of me!” I shouted, trying to make light of the situation, despite the fact this man is armed with a firearm.

	

“I told ya not to come here, boy.” He sneered and spit down on the ground next to him. 

	

“Why? There were a bunch of other people here, why can’t I come?” I was starting to get annoyed. Why does he not want me to come here so badly?

	

“You felt it, didn't ya? The pull to come here. You couldn’t explain why, you just needed to, right?” His voice was low, and really ominous. How did he know? I took a second to gather my thoughts.

	

“...yeah, I suppose.” I replied, a little wary of how Reggie would respond.

	

Reggie took a second, like he was thinking, then said: “Come up here, boy. I wanna show ya somethin’.”

Reggie slung his rifle over his shoulder. What is this guy’s deal? First he’s threatening me, and now he’s trying to be friends? He’s going to kill me, I just know it. Reggie is going to shoot me dead and leave my body to become ravaged by the fungal growth, assimilating with my withered corpse…

What the hell am I thinking? I shake the thoughts out of my head, and call Holly over to me, leashing her up and finding a safe way up the cliff face. I remember having these thoughts when I was younger, but they were just nightmares. 

I eventually make it to the top, slipping and tripping all the way, and see Reggie, his back to me, crouched over something.

	

“So, what did-”

Reggie holds his hand up, and cuts me off:

	

“It’s close, we have to be quiet.”

He gestures to me to come over. I slink over, not even thinking why I need to be quiet, and take a look. It’s a pile of animal corpses, all mutilated and bloodied. Bones shattered and heads torn asunder. I step back and gag, almost throwing up. But I compose myself, and that’s when I notice, growing amidst the heap of gore: tiny mushroom caps, consuming the decaying mass of bodies. Just like in my dreams and visions. 

	

“What did this?” I ask him, in a hushed voice.

	

“The Beast. I been huntin’ it for over a decade now, and ‘round these parts, the thing is like a ghost. Once you spot it, the thing takes off and vanishes.”

What he said sent a chill down my spine, and I think even Holly could tell, she started whining and panting real hard. What the hell did he mean by that? I’ve been here before and never even heard of such a story. This sounds like some shit you’d hear in a movie or something.

	

“I haven’t heard of it, maybe just some coyotes or wolves  did this?” Despite the fact I photograph wildlife, I don’t really know all that much about animals.

	

“No. Wolves and the like always eat their prey. This thing likes to toy with it, play with it. It never eats what it kills, only displays it in its territory.” Reggie sounded serious. I thought he’s just trying to scare me so I never came back, but he sounded like he was scared. 

	

“Well, have you seen it?” I asked, thinking he might be mistaking it for a bear or something.

	

“Yes. It tore up my truck and almost killed me. The thing is ‘bout 20 feet tall, maybe more. It's got these massive claws, sharp as razors, and huge, long fangs comin’ out from its mouth. It’s body seems to be a mass of plants, or mushrooms, I don’t really know.”

	

“Okay… do you know anything else about it?”

“I don’t think it likes canines. I’ve never seen it kill wolves or nothin’. If I were huntin’ it, and somethin’ started howlin’, it would just vanish.”

“Huh, well maybe we should just get-”

Reggie cuts me off:

	

“No, we have to get to my cabin, it’s already got our scent. You’re stuck with me now kid.”

Great. I tried to object but he just stared back at me. His eyes darted everywhere. I could tell he was frightened.

I followed Reggie through twisted brambles and fallen trees for maybe 15 minutes. I’m not really sure. But it’s just now I've noticed that my head is starting to hurt. I normally get headaches when I overexert myself, but this is different. It’s like a knife is being plunged into my brain stem, and whoever is wielding it is playing around with it, not trying to kill me, but torture me. If only they would drive it in, deep into the soft, squishy gray matter, splattering the brains everywhere and leaving a horrific mess of gore to be consumed by the underbrush. The ravenous fungi- 

There it is again. The thoughts of murder, blood, and entrails. What the hell is going on? Everytime those thoughts appear, tiny red trails appear at the edge of my vision, and I get this insatiable feeling to be consumed. Not eaten by another person. But by nature. To decompose and return to the loam of the earth, and become a part of the cycle of nature. I’m no psychopath. Is it these woods that’s doing it to me? Or could it be…

	

“We’re here.” Reggie walks up to the door to his cabin, unlocks it, and walks inside. I had been so out of it, lost in my thoughts that I was just on autopilot, and didn’t even notice it. It’s dilapidated. The harsh elements of wintertime have worn away the wooden walls. He doesn’t seem to come here often. I don’t even know where we are anymore, I can tell Holly is getting anxious. I kneel down and pet her, trying to calm her down.

	

“I know girl, I’m scared too. We’ll get going soon, I promise.” I whisper to her, giving her a soft kiss on top of her head. 

I step in through the almost collapsed doorway and into the cabin. It’s small, one giant room with a cot, a wood-burning stove, a table with a chair, and some camping supplies. Reggie stands over the table, looking down at a map laid across it. I sit down and take a look. The map appears to show the area of the park. It’s a lot bigger than what I remembered. And etched across it in red marker are a few X’s.

	

“This here is a map of the area. These X’s are spots where I’ve encountered the beast. And this here is where we are.”

Reggie points at a circle, I noticed something odd though. All of the X’s form a circle around his cabin. No, not a circle, a spiral. Reggie points at the outermost X.

	

“This was my first encounter with it. I was drivin’ down the road and the thing ran out from the forest. I almost hit it, but swerved into tree. It then ran up on me and attacked my truck. I got out and ran, and it eventually ran too. Ever since, I’ve had that strange pull towards this place, that feeling that I need to be here. Like you do.”

I stayed quiet, pondering. Have I seen this creature before? Is that why I feel like I need to come back?

	

“So, do you think I encountered this ‘beast’ before?” I asked. I felt stupid even entertaining the idea.

	

“Mhmm. I believe this thing, whatever it is, wherever it’s from, drives a nail into one’s mind, making them come back to it, so that it can do…. Whatever it does with people.”

	

“So you still don’t know why it kills?” I asked Reggie. He just shook his head.

	

“Nope. But I gotta ask” Reggie narrowed his eyes and leaned down towards me. “Are you gettin’ thoughts? Thoughts of hurtin’ yerself or others?” 

I could tell this question made him anxious, like he was preparing himself for my answer.

	

“...no, not that I can think of.” I lied, I just had a feeling he would shoot me right then and there.

	

“Good, cuz once you do, the beast has gotten too deep in your thoughts and it’ll do somethin’. I dunno what but I know it’s prolly not good.” Reggie stood back up and walked over to a small lockbox next to his cot, opened it up and turned towards me.

	

“You’re gon’ need this. We’re goin’ out and killin’ that thing once and for all.” I looked down inside the box and saw a pistol. I was shocked. I’ve never held a gun before, let alone shot one. I think Reggie could tell.

	

“I can’t be the only one with a gun out there, and plus if I die, you gotta be able to protect yourself, kid. Take it.”

I grasp the cold, metallic gun and look at it. My heart dropped into my stomach. I can’t do this. I won’t do it.

“Kid, you good?” Reggie asked. I shake myself and come to. I nod and stand up.

	

“Can I leave my dog here? I don’t want her getting hurt.” I asked Reggie. He nodded and brought a bowl with some water and gave it to her.

I kneel down and give Holly a kiss and a hug.

	

“I’ll be back girl, I promise.”

We had been walking for what felt like an eternity. It was already around 2 PM. I checked my phone a few times, but with the reception out here being so bad, I didn’t have any hope of calling or texting anyone for help.

Reggie had told me that we were going to follow its trail. The creature seems to leave some sort of path in its wake. Wasn’t sure what he meant by that, but it made sense when we got to it. The trail was maybe 10 feet wide, winding and twisting its way through the brush. Normally, I would have just chalked this up to some old hiking trail that never saw use in over a decade. But, the path seemed to be composed entirely out of various fungi.

I was starting to get lost in thought, just staring deep into the odd walkway of mushrooms. The image of falling into it, letting the growth take over my body. Dissolving my existence away into nothingness…

“Look kid…” Reggie spoke, his voice trailing off for a second, breaking the silence of the hike.

“I hadn’t been completely honest with ya.” Oh great, is he gonna tell me how I’m eternally fucked? I thought. My mind raced with thoughts, but I kept my mouth shut, waiting for Reggie to speak.

“Now, I did see the beast that night on the road. But it wadn’t just me in my truck. My son was also with me.” His voice croaked with the last few words being spoken.

“Yeah? Is… is he okay?” I sheepishly asked, knowing full well I knew what his answer would be.

“...No. He died that night. The Beast grabbed him. It tore him apart.” I could tell Reggie was about to cry. It seemed like this night still played on repeat in his mind.

“Shit, I’m really sorry.” I responded. I had no idea what to even say. “What was his name?”

“Danny. Loved comin’ out with me on my huntin’ trips. Though never had a real compassion for it, just loved nature I s’pose.” Reggie’s voice was shaky and shuddering. I don’t think he’s ever told anyone.

“Sounded like a nice kid, Reggie.” I was feeling incredibly uncomfortable now. I was never great with consoling people, let alone when it came to the death of a child.

“...yeah. He was. Loved him to death.”

Reggie sighed and composed himself.

“Now I spend every wakin’ moment trying to avenge him. That thing won’t get away, not now.” Reggie seemed almost invigorated. 

	

“So… what’s the plan?” I asked Reggie.

	

“We find it. We kill it.” He replied.

Fantastic plan you got there Reggie. I was already getting thoughts that we were screwed. The thing was gonna jump on us at any moment and we were done for. 

Reggie taught me how to use the pistol as we were walking and it helped me feel a little more confident, but knowing what we’re going up against doesn’t help whatsoever.

	

“So when we do find it, we just start shooting? Or what?”

	

“No, we’re gon’ talk to it, have some coffee and make friends. Of course we gon’ shoot it!” I could tell Reggie seemed frustrated.

“I been followin’ this trail for the past year or so.” He said. “With how elusive the beast is, it’s been rather hard tryin’ to find its lair. This trail always just seems to end. Right…”

Reggie’s voice trailed off for a second, as he was still following the path the creature took.

“Here.” He stopped, and pointed down. I didn’t notice what he was showing me, but then I realized. The monster’s tracks ended in a mushroom circle. 

“Weird. Animal tracks don’t typically just stop in the middle of them.” I said. Reggie looked over at me and nodded.

“This is the reason why I haven’t been able to get this thing. These tracks seem to just stop, with the beast vanishin’ into thin air.” Reggie’s voice got really quiet near the end, and he dropped to the ground and pulled up his rifle.

“Now be quiet, I hear somethin’.” At first I didn’t know what he was talking about, but then I heard it too. Whispering maybe? No, too loud. But not loud enough to be talking. But even if it was, it didn’t sound like any language I knew. Just kind of sounded like gibberish, coming from a cluster of trees just ahead of us. Reggie held up his rifle and peered through the scope. I tried to get a better look but couldn’t see much through the thick foliage.

Suddenly, I felt a tap on my shoulder, opposite Reggie, and a strong force hit the back of my skull and everything went dark.

I wasn’t sure how long I was out for. I had some pretty haunting dreams. The sensation of peeling the flesh from my body, like skinning a soft potato. Ripping out my organs and consuming them, ravenously, as if I had never eaten before. Other people were surrounding me, all humming that same gibberish chant, in a vast expansive void. 

I’m slapped awake, and notice I’m in another cabin, tied to a wooden post nailed to the back wall. I look over and see Reggie, still and lifeless on the floor, tied up just like me. I take a second to gather myself, the light from the candles burning around the room, burning my retinas. Then, I realized that someone was standing over me.

“Who are you? And how did you get here?” the person speaks, in almost perfect english. It sounds like they have an accent, Germanic? Maybe Scandinavian? I couldn’t really tell, but I know that people from the midwest don’t have those accents.

I groggily blink my eyes and lick my lips. “I.. uh… I’m not… sure…” I reply, still a bit out of it from the blunt force trauma to my skull, which I can now feel the cold trickle of blood streaming down the back of my neck.

“I will ask again. Who. Are. You?” the person repeated, seemingly unsatisfied with my answer. I eventually told them my name, and that I came here with my dog to just take some pictures, but got wrapped up in something with Reggie. 

I try to get a good look at the person standing over me, but their face is covered with some burlap sack, stained with blood. They’re wearing some old outfit, like something you’d see back in the medieval times. Like some dark wool tunic and weather-worn trousers.

The person stands back up, and another walks in, wearing another burlap sack over their head. They walk over to Reggie, and kick the side of his chest. He coughs and rouses from his unconsciousness. The two people then start conversing in some language that I can’t understand. It sort of sounds European, but I just can’t figure out where.

The first person walks back over to me, and unties me from the board I was restrained to, leaving my hands still bound. They lift me up and begin to walk me out of the cabin, along with Reggie.

Walking through the doorway, what I thought was only an hour or so, turned out to be maybe 5 or 6, with it being completely dark out. We appear to be in some kind of camp, with two other wooden buildings. In the center, is a circle of candles, and a long wooden pole, maybe 30 feet high, that stands in the center of the ring. 2 other people are standing just on the outside of the candles, humming to themselves.

The person walking Reggie takes him to the center, whilst I am held back. They tie him up to the pole, slap him a little to make sure that he is awake, and then take a few steps back so they are outside of the circle, and also begin to hum.

The person shoves me down to the ground, and stands on my feet. I’m completely trapped. I could try to run, but I have no idea where I am, and if any of these people are armed. I knew I’d be screwed, so I just went along with it. 

One of the people began to start chanting something. It’s that same chanting that Reggie and I had heard earlier, before we were taken. I still can’t figure out what they’re saying, but it seems like a few English words break through. Something like “Harvest” or “Decay” but I’m not too sure. And there’s one word that stands out to me, it almost sounded like a name, Disir? I’m not sure.

The chanting was getting louder and louder, a crescendo of voices all collapsing into one harmonious song. Then, it all stops suddenly. A quiet wind blows through the camp, with the only sound coming from Reggie and his ragged breathing. 

I spot something in the trees lining the camp. It definitely wasn’t there before. A massive creature, maybe 15 feet in height, its eyes reflecting back the light from the candles, with the rest of its body cloaked in shadow. And that’s when I feel it, the light-headedness that I felt years ago when I was here with my family. Have I seen the creature? I couldn’t have, it’s massive and I definitely would have known if I had seen something like that. I look around nervously at the others. They don’t seem to notice. Rather, they are intentionally not looking at it, all with their heads bowed in silent prayer.

Then, in a flash, the creature is suddenly in the center of the camp, and now I can finally get a good look at it. It seems to be some sort of conglomeration of plants and fungi. Its massive, tree-trunk-like legs hold up its almost elephant-like body, with each three-toed foot ending in long, sickle-like talons. It has a thick neck that ends in a huge mass of circular mushrooms where a head would be, with several antlers jutting out from the top of it in unnatural ways. Two, beady black orbs for eyes stare down at Reggie as spindly “arms” unfurl from its body and grasp the sides of his head. 

Reggie begins to scream, the only sound coming from him that tells me he is aware of what's going on. The creature slides him up the pole so he is eye level with it. A loud, tearing sound can be heard as the creature’s “head” splits in two vertically, straight down the middle. Two rows of jagged and serrated teeth jut out from the maw. Then, a faint, pale green light seems to emanate from the mouth of the creature. As Reggie stares into it, he stops screaming, and goes limp, staring right back into it, as if he is stuck in a comatose trance. Small tendrils begin to writhe out of the creature’s mouth and wrap around Reggie’s head, before pulling it in. And with a single swift crunch, tears his head clean off and drops his body to the ground with a loud THUD.

As that happens, the other people begin a loud, discordant prayer, before stopping after a few seconds. Then, the creature looks at me. I felt my stomach drop. 

I was next.

The person grabs my hands and yanks me towards the pole. I start shouting and screaming, fighting the whole way, but the person’s grip is too strong, and I was too weak and tired. They tied me up to the pole, and the creature had retreated back to the tree line. I didn’t even see it move. They then walk back to the outer ring with the others and they all begin their chant once more.

I’m now sobbing hysterically. I don’t want to die. I thought I was a good person in life, I didn’t deserve this. But maybe I was just at the wrong place at the wrong time. 

The beast was then instantly in front of me. Its small, lanky arms protruding from its body grasped the sides of my head and pulled me up towards it. The same ripping sound can be heard, as its head splits once again. I got a better look now. It’s mouth was a cyclone of fangs, and at the back of it’s “throat” looked to be a… face? A familiar face.

It was the old woman at the diner. She was staring right back at me from the cavernous maw. Expressionless, just like before. Where the arms came out from the creature would be where hers would be on her body. Was she the creature? She opened her mouth and that same emerald glow returned, coming from her mouth and eyes, and I was instantly in a trance.

The tentacles started sprawling out and began to wrap around my head. They were cold, lifeless, and uncaring.

Just as I was about to accept my fate, I heard barking in the distance. The light faded as she closed her mouth. The tentacles retreated back into the creature’s maw and it seemed to get scared. It dropped me to the ground and turned to the others.

The other people stopped chanting and started shouting to each other in their language, seemingly in shock, anger, and nervousness. They started rushing around, trying to grab whatever they could, but the creature seemed angered with them, as it turned and began to eviscerate everyone else.

The creature was fast. Faster than the human eye. With swift movements, the people seemed to just explode into a burst of gore. No screams, no cries of pain or agony, just instant death.

Out from the outskirts of camp, the barking grew louder. And as I looked, I was in utter shock. It was Holly! She somehow broke out of Reggie’s cabin and heard my screams. She saw the creature and began barking and snarling at it. It’s almost as if Holly knew it would be scared of her. The creature let out a massive shriek and ran off into the woods.

Holly ran over and sat down in front of me, panting and licking my face. I just sat there for a second, sobbing and babbling incoherently. I was finally able to compose myself, and freed my hands from their bindings.

Shakily, I stood up and gathered my things. I walked over to the body of Reggie and just stared. It was disgusting, seeing someone decapitated, but I felt sorry for him. I felt responsible for his death even though I knew this probably would have happened to him eventually. 

I wanted some answers. Who were these people? Why are they out here? And what was that thing?

I decided to look through the bodies around me. I didn't find much, but the first person who talked to me had a small journal, in an inner pocket of their tunic. I take it out and examine it. It’s maybe the size of a pocket bible. Leather-bound, and seemingly homemade. On the front, it had a single word carved into it: Dís. I began flipping through some of the pages. All of it was in some language that I couldn’t read, but that word kept coming up. I could see runes inscribed on some of the pages. I recognized some of them to be Norse. I slipped it into my pocket.

Norse runes? Are these people from Scandinavia? What the hell were they doing there?

I decided to take a look in the other cabins of the camp, to make sure there was nobody else to come after me. It appeared to be a bunk room, with 8 beds situated on the left and right walls. I only noticed 4 people, where did the others go?

I walked over to the last building which was larger than the other two, with massive double wooden doors. Each had a large rune engraved on the front of them. The one with eight lines coming out from the center, and each of them ending in a prong shape? I see people get tattoos of them sometimes. I swung the doors open. The dark chamber beckoned me to enter.

Walking inside, this building appeared to be some sort of worship hall. Pews lined the center and at the very back was an altar. On the far back wall, behind the altar, was a mural depicting some woman with long, flowing hair, holding a sickle in one hand, and some grains or wheat in the other. Is this who they were worshipping? Is this the woman from the diner?

I walked up to the altar and found another book resting on it. This was another leather-bound bible, though nothing was written on the front of it. I flipped it open, and was unpleasantly surprised to find that it was all in that same language. Frustrated, I slammed it shut. I gave a big sigh and left the way I came.

Holly seemed anxious to leave. I knelt down to her and gave her some pets, telling her that we’re leaving now.

In the distance, I could hear it. The howls of the monster echoing throughout the forest. I know it still was wanting something, but I wasn’t going to stick around to find out.

The drive home was quiet. Holly was passed out in the back seat, she seemed just as tired as I was. I eventually got reception and a flood of texts and missed calls hounded my phone all from my parents. I called them back, saying I had lost track of time and fell asleep in my car and that I was on my way home. I didn't really know what to tell them, I knew they wouldn’t believe me.

Ever since, the nightmares and visions slowly faded away. The influence the beast had on me waned, but whenever I get a glimpse of that journal, I feel that pull to return. With it still being alive, I’m sure it will worm its way back into my skull. Every so often, I think back on that day.

Have any of you made such dynamic work?,"We’ve been dating for almost a year and we have a lot of fun together and get along well, however, my boyfriend became sort of a hermit lately. Not just with me, but with everybody else. He doesn’t really enjoy going outside, and I don’t mean it as in going out to clubs but just simply taking a walk or having a coffee somewhere. We spend 90% of our time at home, 10% shopping. If I do invite him to go somewhere he does come, but sometimes I feel like he only does so to please me. He never takes the initiative. He says he’s tired from work and admitedly so he had a tough year as he was facing job instabilty which I totally understad, however I just think after the pandemic he had this personality change where unless he doesn’t have a reason to, he doesn’t go out of the house.

I did comunicate this to him and I explained that to me, it is a love language for the other person to show that they want to experience life with me. I said he doesn’t have to do everything that I want, but I just want an outing every now and then and I can’t do with nothing at all. He said he agrees and it’s just been a tough year but he is willing to do better. 

I just worry that he’s never going to change and this is a difference I cannot get past. I had two other serious relationships in my life where this was a problem. 

My ex for example was the same. When I asked him to sometimes give me company he’d either come with me and be incredibly angry, make me feel like shit for making him come, or just straight up say no. We never spend time outside the house unless with friends, but his, not mine, and I also did everything around the house. In time, I began to feel like a caretaker who got nothing in return and I became very frustrated. I was very angry and resentful, I communicated to him time and time again what my needs were and he ended up cheating on me. His reasoning for cheating was that I was always moody, never dressed up for him anymore (to go where, lmao?) and wasn’t pleasent to come home to anymore.

I don’t want to breakup, but I also don’t want to end up the same way I did with my ex, so I don’t know how to feel.",1,1767651061.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False
1q4ztcp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q4ztcp,Night Rider MC,"I watched as the house across the street had been sold. I sure hope it does not have a bunch of teenage girls. I don't need that kind of shit, and neither do my members. I watched as a woman and for boys all well over 6 feet, 4 inches or more tall got out of the cars. Then I noticed the Indian motorcycle pulled up and parked behind a truck.


My VP and I watched as a small boy got off. Then our mouths dropped open. It was a girl whos hair flew down her back, past her hips as she took off her helmet. We heard one of the boys yell something and she ran over and jumped into his arms. She is short, very, short. But I am looking at the older woman. She has dark red hair that flows down her back to her hips. She is about 5 feet, 9 inches tall with long legs.


As we watched them walk around the property we heard the boys talking about how much land came with it. And there were two three car garages. And a huge metal building in the back. We sat watching to see what happened next. Sure enough the for sale sign was removed.


We watched as the older woman and one of the older boys got into the truck and headed to town. Just then the bigger boys grabbed the girl and started tossing her back and forth. We heard them yelling she had to agree to something. I heard her yell ""fuck you guys."" They stood her on her feet and crossed their arms. Looking down at her.


The started yelling at her and I laughed as she just stood there and glared at them. She showed no fear of them. ""Dam that little girl is a spitfire"" I said looking at my VP. My VP is a 24 year old man that loves pussy. My VP's name is Ripper. He looked at me laughing. ""She is a handful isn't she?"" The we really laughed as she walked away giving them the finger.


I was so pissed at my brothers. I just turned 18 and will graduate from high school this year. My brothers rang from 25,24,23,22, and 20. Ace is 25, Turk, is 24, Panther is 23, Racer is 22, and Fist is 20. Mom stopped having kids after I came along. My dad died in a bar fight trying to protect my mother.


My dad's brother is the president of the Wild Eagle MC. of Lima, Ohio. His name is Hunter. He told mom about this house. Mom sold our house and decided to move from Fort Wayne, Indiana to Celina, Ohio. I sit down on the porch and lit a joint.


I looked up and saw the moving truck pull into the driveway. I walked into the house and looked at all the bedrooms. I turned left at the top of the stairs. I walked down the hallway and opened the door. This is my room, it has its own bathroom.


""I opened the window and yelled down that they better pick their bedrooms because this one is mine.""


They can't argue with that because this one is purple. A girls room. I heard them running toward the room I was in. My brothers were yelling they want this one until they walked in and saw the walls are purple.


""Fuck that"" they said. They all turned and started looking around until they all had picked the rooms they wanted. My bed was up and the boxes stacked against the wall. I made my bed, then started hanging my clothes in the closet. Then I put them in the dresser.


My desk was against the wall next to the door. I had everything unpacked and turned my radio on. Then I climbed out my window and sat on he roof.


I looked up and saw her sitting on the roof. She couldn't be more than 18. I heard one of her brothers yelling at her to get off the roof. I caught my breath as she walked to the edge and looked down at him.


Granted it could not be more than 5 or 10 feet off the ground. But she could fall and hurt herself. Knight Rider MC


""Do you really want me off the roof Ace."" She asked.


""Get off before you fall.""


I watched as she sat on the edge of the roof. Then she jumped off.


""Fuck,"" I said standing up. Then I saw him catch her.


""Will you stop doing that Star.""


""One of these days you are gong to get hurt.""


I heard her laugh and my breath caught in my throat. It was beautiful. I saw another brother walk out on the porch and he said, ""Mom just called."" She is on her way home with groceries. She will need help unloading them.


She also said she had some news for us. We turned as mom pulled into the driveway and parked. We all started carrying groceries into the house. We started putting them away.


Turk asked. ""What is your news mom?""


""I got a job at the nursing home down the road.""


""I will be the nurse in charge and work the morning shift.""


""There is a nursing assistant position open on the second shift.""


""I brought you an application home, Star.""


""You can work after school. Here is the application."" I start in two days. I can take your application in when I go to work. I took it to my room, filled it out then gave it back to my mom.


""I am going to park my bike in the big shed out back. I said walking out the door. I walked over sat on my bike and started it. Then I started it and rode around the cars and trucks to the back yard.


I drove it into the building parked it, shut it off and got off walking out of the building. I walked over to my mustang and parked it in the garage. I then walked back into the house.


Chapter 2: Brandy


I am the mother of four boys and one daughter. I am a nurse and I just moved my family to Celina, Ohio. My husband was killed last year in a bar protecting me. I needed to move from Fort Wayne, Indiana. I moved to a nice town with a lake. It is not a big town but that is what I wanted for my kids. I moved across the street from the Knight Rider MC.


I heard a knock on the front door. I opened it large, tall man wearing a cut standing there. I opened the door and ""asked if I could help him.""


""I want to introduce myself. My name is Gunner and I am the president of the club across the street.""


""We are having a BBQ this weekend and would like to invite you and your family over. It starts at 7:00 pm.""


""My name is Brandy, Thank you, we will be there.""


I watched as he walked down the porch steps. That was nice of him. I told the boys were invited to the BBQ. Star is not home so I will tell her in the morning. I got home at 1:00 Am. Everyone was in bed. I walked into my room and put my money in a lock box. I made $25,000 tonight. I took a shower and went to bed. I have school in the morning.


I got up and dressed for school. I made me coffee and cereal. I put my bowl in the dishwasher before walking out and getting into my car. I drove to the high school and parked my car. I walked to the office and got my schedule. After school I walked to my car and drove home. Again no one was home when I walked in.


I made me a sandwich and coffee before I walked up stairs to my room where I changed into shorts and a tee-shirt. I ate my sandwich and drank my coffee before I completed my homework. We have been here almost a week now. Tomarrow is Saturday. I wonder what mom has planned.


It seems my brothers have all planned to stay at the club across the street. They are hardly at home anymore. I miss Panther. He moved to Florida a week ago. He is the president of his own MC now. I walked down stairs and saw my brothers in the living room.


""What are we all doing tomarrow?""


We don't know about you, but we have all been invited to a BBQ across the street.


""What do you mean, you don't know about me?""


""I wasn't invited?""


""Mom didn't mention you.""


""Oh, Ok,"" I said getting up and walking out the front door to sit on the porch. I felt a tear slide down my face. I was not invited to attend the BBQ. How could mom do that? It was not fair that I was not invited and they would go without me. I watched as mom and the boys started out the door.


I said. ""Mom how could you go over there when I was not invited.""


I than ran out the door got on my bike and drove out of the driveway and down the road.


""What did she mean by that Ace.""


""Well, you told us boys that you and we were invited.""


""You didn't mention Star, so we told her she was not invited.""


I drove to the restaurant in town and parked my bike. I saw a girl come out and get on her bike.


""Hey, didn't you move into the house across the street from our club?""


""Yes, why do you ask?""


""Aren't you coming to the BBQ?""


""I was not invited.""


""My brothers said that just them and my mom was.""


""That can't be right, my brother would not do that.""


""Well apparently he did."" I said turning and walking into the restaurant and ordered food. I looked out the window and saw it was getting dark so I got on my bike and rode home.


I saw them walk into the club but I did not see the girl. Where is she? Introductions were made and I asked.


""Where is your daughter?""


""She was not invited.""


""Wait, What?""


""Of course, she was.""


""Fuck."" I heard her brothers say.


""We didn't think she was because she is not 21.""


""Of course, she was invited. This is a family BBQ.""


""She left the house when we told hers she was not invited.""


I was pissed that Gunner did not include that girl in the invitation. I walked in the club slamming the door.


""How the fuck could you do that Gunner?""


""What?""


""Not invite that girl here.""


""And you,"" I said, looking at her mother and brothers.


""What the fuck is wrong with you?""


""As her mother you should not have come here without her.""


""Some fucking mother you are.""


""And you guys as her brothers should have stood up for your little sister.""


""She told me our club can go straight to hell.""


""And I just bet she will have somethings to say to all of you.""


I said. ""Gunner you should have mad it plain that girl was included in the invitation.""


""Where is she Grace?""


""In town at the restaurant.""


Then we heard the bike coming down the street. That might be her returning home."" Go get her Ripper.""


I saw her walk into the house as I walked across the street. I knocked on the door and waited for her to answer it. I opened the door and saw the VP standing there. I looked at him with cold eyes. I slammed the door shut and locked it.


What the hell just happened I asked myself. Her eyes were like ice. She took one look at me and slammed the door shut without saying one word. I knocked again but she didn't answer it. I walked back to the club.


""Where is she?"" Asked Gunner.


I told him what happened and her brothers gasped.


""Fuck mom, she is going to do it again.""


""She is going to shut down.""


Chapter 3: Five Months Later


I have not talked to my mom or my brothers. Mom is dating the president Gunner. I do not talk to any of the them. That is because they live in the clubhouse now. I never see any of them.


They don't answer my phone calls either. I feel as if they have forgotten about me. I graduated from high school three days ago. Not one of them remembered or were there at least for me.


I did know that some of the bikers were at the graduation. Because five of the members kids graduated with me. I saw my mother and brothers sitting with them. I did not hear my name called out and they did not meet me afterwards to take any pictures.


I watched as they posed with the club and their kids for pictures. I saw that same girl as I left the school alone. No pictures of me or my family to remember my graduation. It is as if they forgot that I even existed.


I saw that girl look from me to my family with sad eyes. I turned with tears in my eyes and walked over to my car and left. We were sitting in the club when Grace walked in and looked at us with the coldest eyes.


""What the hell is wrong with you Grace?""


""You did not yell out Stars name has she received her diploma.""


""You did not take pictures with Star after graduation.""


""I just bet she doesn't have a graduation party. No presents.""


""No wonder she hates us all.""


""You forgot you even had a sister.""


We looked at each other and felt like shit. No one yelled her name. We are terrible brothers. We walked over to the house but it was empty. Star is not here.


We tried calling her but it kept going to voice mail. Where could she be? I was home. I was in the back yard behind the big building. I was sitting near a small fire, drinking and smoking.


""Congratulations to me."" I said.""


I had drank about six beers. I looked up at the sky and noticed it was getting dark. I put the fire out, grabbed my beer and walked around the building. The house is dark so that meant everyone was across the street.


I grabbed my beer and walked toward the street from the back yard. I opened my car door and grabbed my Cigarrates. And the joint from the ash tray and lit it. I shut the door and turned around and bumped into someone.


I looked up and saw him, the VP. I went to step around him But he stopped me.


""Why don't you come over to the club and see your mom and brothers?""


""Why should I?""


""I have not been invited there before?""


""And where were they when I graduated?""


""Not with me, they were with your club members, yelling and clapping for their kids.""


""They took pictures with them.""


""I was left out on the side lines. Not one of my brothers or mother yelled or clapped for me.""


""Not one of them took a picture with me.""


""And not one of them gave me a graduation gift or party.""


""I don't owe them one fucking thing.""


""So go straight to hell.""


I gave him the finger and walked into the house. She is one angry person. I heard she graduated from high school and no one was there for her. She had no party, nothing. They forgot about her. It was starting to piss me off.


It was like they forgot they had a sister, and mother had a daughter. She was being left on her own. It all started because she was not at the BBQ.


I tried to talk to her but she wants nothing to do with me or the club. They never even tried to make it up to her. Not one of us even came over or tried to talk to her. We are partly to blame for her anger.


I want to get to know her but that is not going to happen. Her mom is marring Gunner tomarrow. I bet she will not attend. What is she going to do when he moves into the house?


Hell, I wonder if she even knows they are getting married? I walked over and looked at her.


""Are you coming to your mom's wedding tomarrow?""


I saw her turn her head and look at me. I could tell she was shocked.


""You didn't know did you?""


I just looked at him. My face going white. I stood up walked into the house shutting the door behind me. Fuck, she didn't know. I saw the light in her bedroom come on. I walked across the street in a very pissed off mood. Not one of them better say a word to me.


I walked to the spare bedroom where the boxes were kept. I started to carry them to my room where I started to pack the things in my room.


I finished packing my clothes, laptop, and other things. I then walked downstairs, grabbed the news paper and walked back to my room.


I started looking for apartments. I called three of them scheduling a time to see them in the morning. Then I shut my bedroom light off and looked across the street.


Why have they all forgotten about me? I don't get it. It is as if I don't matter to them anymore. I was off work today because it was supposed to be a day of celebration for me. It isn't, no one cared about me.


I heard the doorbell and walked down stairs. I saw it was Ace and Panthers girlfriends. ""We came to the party to celebrate your graduation.""


""Where is the party Star?""


""What Party?""


""What do you mean what party?""


""I don't have one. No one even came to see me graduate.""


""We were told to come for the graduation party.""


""You must mean for the club members kids that graduated.""


""There is none for me.""


""They are across the street.""


I saw the anger in their eyes.


""Right over there."" I said.


I closed the door, locked it and walked back upstairs. What the hell we said. How dare they do that to Star.


""I don't know about you Belle,""


"" but I will not date a man that does that to his sister.""


"" I am with you Iris said.""


We put the gifts on the porch. We stormed across the street. When we walked in we found Ace and Panther. We walked over and looked at them in anger.


""You made it to the graduation party""


It got really quiet. ""We went to the house where we thought was Star's graduation party.""


""But found there is no graduation party for Star.""


""So, how was her graduation party boys?""


We all looked at each other.


""We didn't go to her graduation.""


""No you didn't. Instead you went to this fucking clubs kids graduation instead of your own sisters.""


""You are having a graduation party for this clubs kids Instead of giving your baby sister a graduation party.""


""We cannot, and will not have boyfriends who treat their sister like that.""


""Find new girlfriends.""


""You do not mean that.""


""Oh but we do. Tell us this Ace, Panther. Have you guys paid any attention to your sister since you moved in here?""


""Has she been over here?""


""Did this club include her in the graduation?""


""No, so go to hell.""


""We are going to drag Star out of that house, get her drunk, get into fights, and give her a celebration she will never forget.""


""You two go fuck yourselves.""


We turned walked out of their clubhouse and slammed the door shut. We walked over to the house and pounded on it until Star opened it. We walked in and pulled her to her room.


We went threw her boxes until we found what we were looking for. ""Put these on and come back out here.""


""What are you doing?""


""We are going out to celebrate your graduation.""


""We are going to our club. Or your uncles club.""


While she was dressing we called her uncle Hunter and told him everything. He was pissed.


""Bring her here, we will get the cake and ice cream and gifts.""


""Bring her herein two hours.""

1q4zmv8,https://www.reddit.com/r/christiandatingadvice/comments/1q4zmv8/did_you_look_for_signs/,Did you look for signs,"Dating 3+ years and unsure about marriage, I have fasted and prayed for discernment, wisdom, and guidance. Finally after 6+ months of confusion increasing not decreasing, I pleaded for a sign. 

1: We were walking around, she gave me her phone to find a Starbucks, and moments later while I'm holding phone she receives a FaceTime call from her single male coworker friend. It took a while to get it out of her but she eventually tells me she had returned a previous FaceTime and placed one FaceTime. I believe nothing was going on (related to a job she applied for where he knew a friend), but it is inappropriate behavior regardless. Definitely not wife behavior in my eyes. What are the odds this happens while I'm holding her phone. 

2: Another time, I go alone to a coffee shop while she's traveling with family. At this particular point I'm doubtful that God even cares. She's away and it's not like I'll discover anything new to shift my thinking one way or another, is what I told myself. Beside me a table opens up, and a young woman and her older relative sit down to catch up over the holidays. For a good portion of the talk, the college girl talks about her recent breakup and incompatibility reasons, while the older relative reassures her and shares her own experience of jumping into marriage perhaps too fast. Again thinking about everything that had to fall in place for  me to hear this very specific conversation blows my mind.

Am I overthinking this? I'm not the type to normally look for signs in everyday life. I don't think I'm deserving of it in any way. But finally in a point of desperation after doing what I could to discern, I asked in humility. At the start of the relationship I felt so thankful to God for bringing her into my lonely life. After the last 6+ months and these recent experiences, I feel sad but very thankful to God for guiding the way. I'm still unsure but I feel like I'm closer to the answer and have given myself a deadline",1,1767650606.0,christiandatingadvice,0,1.0,False

1q4zm1y,https://www.reddit.com/r/FilthyFabulous/comments/1q4zm1y/the_coffee_date_that_ended_in_a_freezer_comment/,The Coffee Date That Ended in a Freezer... Comment,"This happened years ago, before I met my husband.

At the time, I dated mostly online because it was just easier as a mom. I started chatting with a guy and honestly thought we had great chemistry. We talked all the time. He was funny, kind, and came across as really chill.

Eventually, he asked to meet up.

He suggested going to his place, which looking back should have been a massive red flag, but I just said no and suggested coffee instead (Gold star for at least some instincts)🙄

So we meet for coffee and immediately something is off.

This man barely speaks. Like at all.

He just stares at me.

I am talking, trying to keep the conversation going, and he is nodding or shaking his head. That is it. No stories. No follow up questions. Just intense eye contact and silent agreement.... with this weird A smirk.

The whole thing is painfully awkward.

I assumed maybe he was nervous, so I tried to make him feel more comfortable, but the way he was looking at me started to make me uncomfortable. Not shy. Not sweet. Just unsettling.

I finished my coffee as fast as humanly possible (dam near burning my esophagus) and said I had to go.

He stood up and followed me outside.

As we are standing there, he suddenly leans in to kiss me.

I stepped back immediately and he did this weird little awkward smile, then asked if I wanted to come back to his house.

And I do not know what possessed me, but before my brain could intervene, I blurted out (loudly)

""Do you think I want to see the bodies in your freezer?""

And then I turned around and left. I blocked him immediately and never saw or spoke to him again.

To this day, I stand by it... That man had bodies in his freezer, or at the very least, I was going to be one!",1,1767650554.0,FilthyFabulous,0,1.0,False

1q4zkiu,https://i.redd.it/7f0w4spcslbg1.jpeg,The Donut That Never Left,"Jelly-filled. Pink icing and rainbow sprinkles delicately blanketed the top of its exquisite, glistening mass. This delightfully devious little body made of sugar, fried dough, and strawberry-flavored goop tempted me to the point of no return. I pressed the tip of my index finger against the glass and said,

""This one.""

I knew I shouldn't have. But I'd been so good lately. I deserved a treat. And besides, I'd make up for it at the gym later, then pound a fuck-ton of water and flush that bitch right out. Yeah, it's no big deal. It's Friday: cheat day. And this week's been hell. I *needed* this.

""That'll be $1.99, sir.""

The lady at the counter smiled and handed me the bulging bag. I held it close, pressing its warm weight against my chest. My mouth pooled with saliva as I slid her my debit card. 

""Anything else?""

I glanced back toward the glass dome filled with plump pastries, then shook my head. They all looked like whores, slathered in chocolate and cheaply seductive. No substance. Nope, I had everything I needed right here in this greasy white paper bag. *Mine* had fruit. She handed my card back over and said, 

""Have a nice day!""

I grinned, looking down at the bag cradled in my arms. I sure as shit will, I thought. Then, I hurried back to my car to devour this goddess of a donut in seclusion. I needed privacy; this was a moment to be savored. Carefully, I eased my hand into the bag's opening until the tips of my fingers met her soft, pillowy posterior. Once I'd gripped onto the end, I gently pulled to reveal divine perfection. 

The icing lay undisturbed. Every single sprinkle had held on. It didn't feel right to just go in at it. No, it was too beautiful to be ravaged like that. It begged to be adored and cherished. *Worshiped.* I couldn't just bite into this donut like some sort of monster; the jelly would spill out all over, and I didn't have any napkins. 
 
I held it up to my face, admiring the flawless sheen of its glaze in the soft morning light. I inhaled deeply, taking in the heavenly scent that filled me with euphoria. Then, I slid my tongue gently across the surface of its sweet, crispy skin. 

And that's where it all began. This simple little act of mindless self-indulgence would later become the single biggest regret of my life.

Yet, a smile crept across my face as the intense warmth of this magnificent exterior overwhelmed me. I had one thought, and one thought only: I needed to get to what was inside. Slowly, I sank my teeth deep into its sugary flesh, carefully removing the tiniest of morsels and releasing a floodgate of warm, red jelly. I let the intoxicating, chunky, viscous liquid pour into my mouth and surrendered to the ecstasy. 

After that, I blacked out.

When I came to, I'd devoured the whole thing. Not a trace of it remained—even my fingers had been licked clean and sucked dry. I searched the bag, hoping there might be a tiny smidge of icing left behind. Nothing. Not even a sprinkle. It was all gone. 

*Shit, I don't even get to keep the memory of enjoying it? Why did I scarf it down so quickly?*

The only evidence that I'd done so was the lump pressing hard at the back of my throat as the last bite made its way down my esophagus and onto the gullet. Guess I need to work on that whole *'self-control'* thing.

But as I drove to work in my sugared-up intoxication, the lump began to squirm. Must be a burp trying to come out, I thought. Probably swallowed a fuck ton of air during my binge-fit. I slammed my fist against my chest, but it didn't help. Instead, I could feel my throat tightening around the bulge, trying to push it down. 

No—*the opposite.* It felt like that hunk of donut was forcing its way down, in spite of my body trying to stop it. What the fuck. 

My eyes watered as I began to gag, choking on the wad of dough that had now firmly planted itself just above my sternum. The bitch wasn't moving at all. I struggled to keep my eyes on the road, frantically searching the floor of my passenger seat for a half-empty bottle of water. Finally, I laid my hand on one, leaned my head back, and chugged. 

Down she went, without a fight. I smiled and threw the empty bottle back down onto the floor where it belonged. Then, I took a deep breath of relief. *God,* how stupid would it have been if I'd choked to death on a fucking donut? Embarrassing. I wiped my eyes and continued down the road. 

By the time I got to work, I had a new problem to deal with. The donut had reached my stomach, landing like a boulder dropped off a cliff. I threw my things onto my desk and ran to the bathroom, thinking I had to take a shit. 

I sat in that stall straining for at least ten minutes, but nothing came out. So, I stood up and pulled my pants back on. When I turned around and looked down at the toilet, I froze. There, floating in the water, was a single blue sprinkle.

My eyes widened, and I blinked a few times. I leaned forward to make sure I was really seeing what I thought I was. Yep. A sprinkle. Not a poop-sized one—a regular one. My body snapped upright. No fucking way that came out of my butt. It had to have been on my pants. I just didn't notice. Yeah. Of course, that's what it was. 

I walked from the bathroom laughing at myself for getting freaked out, even momentarily. My stomach was still killing me, though. The damn donut was sloshing around in the water I'd chugged like a ship caught in a storm. With each step I took, I could feel it rocking back and forth. 

*Gurgle, gurgle. Slosh, slosh.*

When I got to my desk, I started searching around in all the drawers for a roll of Tums. I got excited for a second, until I realized it was just the empty wrapper I'd left myself to be fooled by later. Past me is such an asshole. 

*Gurrrrrp!*

""Shut up.""

Fuck. I had to do something, and quickly. My stomach was visibly rippling at that point, and I could barely stay seated. I thought about undoing my belt, but I didn't want to get accused of being a pervert. Especially not after I accidentally elbowed Sharon from accounting in the boob last week. That was her fault for crowding me at the coffee pot, though. Unfortunately, HR didn't see it that way.

Wait—coffee! That'll make me shit, I thought. Even though my stomach was past maximum capacity, it seemed like my only option. A shot of black coffee to the gut might just do the trick to move this mass along. The bitch had already overstayed her welcome; it was time for an eviction notice. 

I hurried to the break room to find Sharon at the coffee pot. *Of course.* I kept my distance as we silently exchanged awkward glances. I didn't want to look her in the eye, so I stared at the coffee pot in her hands instead. But I was so uncomfortable. I could barely keep still as my gurgles and groans echoed through the otherwise empty room. 

She cut her pour short, grabbed a handful of Sweet'N Low packets, then rushed out the door while covering her nose. *Pftt*—probably thought I was farting. Believe me, lady. I wish I *could* fart.

I poured a splash and a half into my cup and threw it back, still scalding. It burned all the way down, but I didn't care. The pain in my throat was a welcome distraction from the mayhem that was going on in my stomach. And yeah, the roof of my mouth was going to be fucked for a day or two. But I figured if it worked, then it would all be worth it. After all, that was my last-ditch effort to be able to make it through the rest of my workday. 

It also turned out to be a big mistake.

The searing black liquid landed with an eruption. I immediately doubled over in the worst pain I'd ever felt in my life. The wad of sugary dough had begun to thrash violently, slamming itself against the walls of my stomach. No, I'm not fucking joking. I could feel it. Not just in my stomach—with my hands, too. I literally felt this donut pounding from the inside out, lifting my skin as it pushed against its gastric prison. 

I ran full speed to the bathroom, praying I'd make it there before I passed out, vomited, or shit my pants. Or, all three. My belly bounced as I ran, suddenly swollen like a puppy with worms. I thought I was bloated before, but now I was literally about to pop. The movement made the pain infinitely worse, but I had no choice. Fuck this. It had to come out. *Now.*

The stall door slammed against the wall, and I fell to my knees, gripping the toilet in preparation. My face was ice-cold and clammy. Warm saliva flooded my mouth. 

“Yes! Come out! Be gone, bitch!”

*GUUURRRPPP*

I began to heave and spit into the toilet. The mass was so close I could taste it, but nothing was coming out. It was fighting me. I shoved my finger down into my throat, scraping against the burnt roof of my mouth. I winced from the pain, and my eyes started watering uncontrollably. A few gags, and up she came. 

A putrid flurry of pink sludge spewed from my mouth, swirled with a deep, crimson red foam. It splattered back up into my face when it hit the toilet at lightning speed. Fuck… so much came out of me, I can't even explain it. But that was only phase one. Next came the chunks. 

By the time I was done, I thought I was going to lose consciousness. The room was spinning, and I struggled to catch my breath, so I lowered myself onto the floor, still hugging the toilet. 

I couldn't help but inspect this ungodly force that had just come out of me. Slowly, I lifted my head and peeked over the seat. 

*Holy shit.* 

I gazed down at the thick, chunky pink vomit in utter shock and disgust. God, it looked like I'd barely chewed this donut. Even the rainbow sprinkles had all remained whole, floating around in the sludge like tiny specks of whimsy in a cotton candy-colored massacre. Amongst them were a few large globs of fleshy beige, accompanied by several smaller red clumps. 

*Christ. I just had to get the one with fruit, huh?*

Suddenly, my eyes fixed on the largest red chunk floating in the middle of the sludge. It looked different than the other ones. Shaped weird. And it was... *moving?* 

I wiped my eyes. Yes—it was fucking moving! Convulsing. Constricting. Sputtering red goop from both ends. It almost looked like a tiny beating heart. 

“No fucking way!”

I stood up so fast, I nearly fell backwards out of the stall. Black spots began to appear in my line of vision. I gripped onto the threshold with both hands as I swayed, trying to regain balance. I held my breath and slowly leaned forward to look again. 

It stopped.

“Oh, thank God. It *wasn't* moving. Fuck, get it together, bro. It's just a chunk of strawberry; how could it have been moving?”

I almost wanted to poke at it, but considering how truly vile the mess I'd made in the toilet was, I resisted that urge.

The hinges of the bathroom door creaked, and footsteps began to approach. I quickly reached over and flushed the rainbow sprinkled slurry. It smelled like death, sickly sweet with a hint of berry. I desperately tried to fan the stink away with one hand while wiping my face with the other.

When I exited the stall, Jerry from sales was at the urinal. He turned to look at me as I approached the sink, visibly disgusted by the pungent odor that had completely filled the room at that point.  

""Gnarly case of food poisoning,"" I told him. 

He nodded, then focused his eyes back in front of him. With a splash of water and a squirt of soap, I quickly washed my hands and ran out of there. On the way back to my desk, I bumped into my boss, who promptly asked what the hell I'd been doing all morning. 

""Sorry, sir. I think I'm coming down with something.""

He folded his arms in front of him, scrunching his eyebrows. 

""That's the excuse you're going with this time?""

""Ask Jerry, he'll tell you. I was just in the bathroom. If you want proof, go in there and take a big whiff."" 

""Alright, that's enough,"" he said. ""Just make sure that report is on my desk before lunch, then you can leave if you need to. And don't forget, you're still on disciplinary probation after last week.""

""Yes, sir.""

Fuck. I forgot all about that damn report. I hadn't even started it yet, and it was almost 10:00. At least my stomach was starting to feel better. My abs were sore from all the heaving, but now that just meant I could skip the gym later. I'd already puked up the donut anyway, so the carbs didn't count. 

Shit, what a weird ass morning I was having—almost got killed by a donut twice. What an evil bitch! She tempted me, then tortured me. Well, lesson learned. Not going back to that bakery again. At least now she was gone, and it was over. 

I sat down at my desk, opened up a Word document, and began typing nonsense. My thoughts were all jumbled up, and my head was throbbing from straining so hard. I kept having to retype each sentence over and over until it made sense. Before I knew it, another hour had gone by, and I was sweating. 

My hand reached up to wipe away the droplets accumulating on the ridge of my brow. Right away, I noticed something weird. My sweat was thick. Like... *goop.* I slowly pulled my hand away in confusion to look at the substance that had just excreted from my pores. 

It was clear, like sweat's supposed to be. But there was a ton of it. And it didn't drip. No, instead, it had gathered in a rounded clump at the edge of my fingertips. I pressed my fingers together. It was sticky, too. *Oh, god.* I slowly raised my hand up to my lips and tasted. It was fucking sugar.

*Okay... something weird is definitely going on. What the fuck was in that donut?!*

I had to leave work. Immediately. To hell with this damn report. I needed to go home and start googling. And also take a shower, because my face and hands were all sticky. Oh, and I still smelled like vomit, too. 

I got up and left everything on my desk as it was, including the open document of word salad on my computer screen. Hopefully, my boss would see all that and realize this was an emergency. If not, oh well, whatever. I'll just deal with it on Monday, I thought.

I raced home, taking a different route to avoid having to pass that bakery. I felt like just the sight of it might make me sick again. There had to be something wrong with that donut. I felt totally normal until I met that sugary bitch. Maybe it really *was* just food poisoning. Fuck—the strawberries! E. coli, duh! *Damn*, should've gotten one of the whores; chocolate would've never betrayed me like that.

Food poisoning didn't explain the sugary sweat, but I was still convinced that's what it was. Maybe I was so sick, I'd started hallucinating? Yeah, that *had* to be it. Ha! The donut wasn't actually thrashing in my stomach. That strawberry chunk wasn't really moving. And the sugar sweat? Just some leftover glaze I didn't realize was there. *Pftt.* I shook my head and chuckled to myself. There was nothing to worry about. It'll pass.

I got home, threw my keys onto the side table, and headed straight for the bathroom. I decided to brush my teeth first. My breath was so rank I couldn't stand it anymore, the taste of sugar and stomach acid still lingering on my tongue. I brushed the hell out of my entire mouth for at least two and a half minutes, then spat into the sink. When I saw what had come out of my mouth, I almost choked. 

Sprinkles. A bunch of them. 

*God, how did they all get stuck in my teeth like that? How did I not feel them?*

I cupped my hand under the faucet and rinsed my mouth out a few times. Each time I spit, more came out. It seemed to be an endless supply of them, like there was a Goddamn sprinkle dispenser somewhere behind my molars. But finally, after the fifth rinse, I ran my tongue across my teeth and didn't feel any more. So, I got into the shower and figured if anything else weird happened, I'd just worry about it then.

Then, something else weird happened.

I turned the hot water on, stepped under the stream, closed my eyes, and began running my hands across my skin. My entire body felt tacky and gross. I reached up to find that my hair felt the same way—it had formed into five or six clumps on the top of my head. Instantly, I pulled my hand away and opened my eyes to grab the shampoo bottle. That's when I noticed it. 

The water that was dripping from my body was milky white. *What the fuck?* I jumped back from the shower head and looked up. The water coming out of it was clear. I scrunched my eyebrows, then slowly looked back down. The thick, milky drippings had started to collect in a pile, clogging up the drain. 

I tried to slide the clump away with my foot, only to have it spread itself in between my toes, like when you step on a glob of peanut butter. It sent a shiver down my spine, and I started flapping my foot around, trying to fling the goop off it. It wasn't moving. So, I reached down to dislodge whatever it was by hand. Just then, I was hit with an oddly familiar scent—the same one that had filled the air of that bakery. Sugar. 

*Jesus H. Christ!* Did I try to fuck it?! Just how much icing did I smear on myself? Shit, I must've rubbed that fucking donut all over my body. Hell no, man. I've done some weird shit in my life, but never with food. That thing must've been drugged! 

My hand shot up to my forehead, my eyes racing back and forth, as I desperately tried to remember anything at all from the ten minutes or so I had blacked out. Nothing. Not a damn thing. God, I *had* to have been slipped something. That was the only explanation that made sense.

My heart was pounding, and I began to feel woozy. I was obviously under the influence of some type of drug, but I had no idea what. I quickly washed my hair, then grabbed the loofah and started frantically scrubbing my body from the top down. 

When I reached my butt, I used my hand to wash in between my cheeks since the loofah was too rough. I was immediately disgusted to find there were little specks of something buried deep within my ass crack. 

I didn't even need to look—I knew what they were. But still, there I was, gawking down at my hand in complete and utter shock nonetheless. 

Sprinkles. At least a dozen or more. 

I was ashamed. Completely disgusted with myself. I couldn't believe I'd actually scratched my ass while eating that donut! Shit, hopefully I waited until after I finished eating at least. But, either way, that meant my fingers were in... and then I... Oh, *God.* 

Whatever—nothing I could do about it now. I rinsed the butt sprinkles from my hand, then continued down to my legs. They were dry. Like, *really* dry. I'm talking sandpaper. Large flakes of my skin started to slough off as I scrubbed, plopping onto the shower floor like tiny, wet crepes. 

I've never been good about moisturizing, and to be honest, I usually don't even wash anything below the knees. But today I had to. They must've just been overdue for a good exfoliating, I thought. 

Once I got out and toweled myself off, I noticed my upper body felt waxy and smooth. Too smooth. It was like a slight, buttery layer of film sitting on top of my skin. My bottom half was the opposite. I thought all those skin flakes coming off would've helped, but my legs still looked extremely dry—almost scaly. I dropped the towel and reached down with my bare hand. When my fingers touched one of the flaked-off portions of my calf, my heart sank. My skin... it felt *crispy.*

Hell no, I am *not* dealing with this right now. I'll just lotion them later if they still feel rough when I sober up.

I shook my head, then leaned forward over the sink to look into the mirror. My pupils were enormous, and a fresh coat of glaze covered my face with a lustrous, glossy sheen. 

*Shit... you're tripping balls, man.*

There was nothing I could do but try to wait it out. If I went to the hospital and started explaining my '*symptoms*', I'd be fitted for a brand new pair of grippy socks in a heartbeat. No. There was no need to panic. I just needed to let whatever the hell drug this was wear off. Run its course. Yeah, it's no big deal. It'll be okay.

I thought sleep would be the answer. So, I hurried off to my bedroom and started covering all the windows with dark blankets to block out the midday sun as best I could. I didn't even bother putting clothes back on. I figured I'd end up sweating like a pig during this detox anyway—no need to dirty another pair of underwear. 

By the time I'd finished blacking out the room, I was already starting to feel like I was burning up. It was like an oven had suddenly kicked on inside me. I plopped myself down onto the bed, splayed out like a starfish, and waited. 

First, the nausea returned. I had to close my eyes to stop the ceiling from spinning. Then, the heat within me intensified. This fierce burning sensation started to tear through my body, radiating deep from my core. *Oh, God.* It was almost unbearable. I clenched onto the bedsheet underneath me with both fists and tried desperately to control my breathing. A buzzing sensation began to spread through my body, like every cell inside me vibrating all at once. My eyes rolled into the back of my head, and the world went black. 

When I woke up, the slivers of sunlight that had been peering out from the sides of the blankets were gone. My eyes darted over to the little red numbers piercing through the darkness of my room. It was 5:00 AM. *Jesus Christ*, I'd slept the entire rest of that day and all through the night. 

I remained still for a moment, trying to assess my mental and physical state, praying everything had gone back to normal. The nausea had passed, but my body was still burning up. My mouth was unbelievably dry, and the air in my room felt stagnant and heavy. It seemed to push down from above like a weighted blanket. Smothering me. I forced in a deep breath, and when I did, I noticed the smell. That fucking *smell.*

However, it wasn't until I attempted to reach up and wipe my face that I began to truly realize the horror I'd woken up to. My arm. It wouldn't move—it was stuck to the bed. The other one, too. And... and my legs. *What the fuck??* My head shot up in a panic, and the pillow came with it.

When I looked down at my body, my jaw dropped open. I was huge. I'm talking gigantic—bloated, puffy, and round beyond belief. I'd gone from a size 34 pants to at least a size 52. Not even joking. It was like I'd gained a hundred pounds overnight. I couldn't believe it. This couldn't be happening. I'd slept for almost 20 hours. The drug should've worn off.

As I glared down in shock, I could see that my now rotund upper body was caked in a thick, opaque layer of pasty goop. It had dripped and clung to the bed, sticking to the skin of my back and arms like a human glue trap. 

From the waist down, I was surrounded by a large, dark red stain on the sheets. Is that—? *No. Can't be.* I blinked a few times, then squinted as my eyes strained to adjust. The mystery red liquid had dried to a crust at the edges, forming a giant congealed mass beneath me. 

I struggled to lift myself up further, forcing my neck forward as hard as I could. Then, I gave myself one good push. As my body squished against itself, more of the thick red goo suddenly appeared... *oozing*… from my fucking belly button.

The secretion slowly slid from the sides of my stomach down into the pile below, landing with a wet *plap.* Instinct took over, and I started to thrash and writhe against the bed, desperate to free myself from this disgusting, sticky goop from hell. 

Peeling my top half from the sheets felt like ripping off a massive Band-Aid. Thick white strings clung to me as the gummy substance stretched and pulled at my skin, trying to force me back down. I bit down hard on my bottom lip and just went for it. I'll admit it—I screamed. Screamed like a bitch. 

Once my arms were free, I moved on to my legs. The red stuff was worse. Much thicker, less give. It was agonizing. Huge, crispy strips of flesh tore from my legs, remaining glued to the clotted red mess that had leaked from my unrecognizably grotesque body. After I'd completely broken free from my adhesive prison, I hobbled to the bathroom, dripping the entire way. 

I stared at myself in the mirror, my gargantuan, sugar-slathered body shaking uncontrollably. *Fuck*. I shouldn't have just gone to sleep. I should have dealt with this when I had the chance. That donut wasn't drugged, it was cursed. Something in it. A demon, possessing me. Changing me. It had hollowed me out and was growing inside me.

I collapsed onto the cold floor and buried my face in my hands. I began to cry. Not tears, of course. Instead of droplets of wetness, I felt little taps of grit. I ripped my hands from my eyes. 

Sprinkles. Rainbow fucking sprinkles. 

An animalistic shriek erupted from my lungs, and I hurled them across the room. They hit the wall with a *ping*, scattering all over the floor like confetti at my funeral. Mocking me. 

I pulled myself back up to my feet, limped over to the shower, and got in. I scrubbed, wincing in pain as the loofah scraped against my raw skin. To distract myself, I started trying to weigh my options. 

I couldn't ignore this anymore. I knew I needed help, desperately. I just didn't know who to turn to. Shit, doctors wouldn't know what to do with me at this point—whatever was happening to me had very quickly devolved into something modern medicine couldn't do shit about. 

I thought about calling my cousin, Sonia, in Maine. Her husband had gone through some weird body shit recently. Maybe she'd know what to do. She was vague about the details of what happened to him when she told me about it a few months ago. Something about fish? What I did remember was she had been very clear about one thing: it didn't end well. 

Scratch that. If she couldn't help him, she definitely couldn't help me either. I gripped the loofah tighter, my body trembling from the pain and fear. I had to do something. I couldn't allow myself to crumble under the weight of my insane circumstance. I refused to let this *thing* take over. 

I shuffled out of the tub, almost slipping on the pink sludge I'd left behind as I lifted my massive, jiggly leg over the side. I carefully dried myself off, soaking up the leftover glaze from my creases. Then, I shakily began trying to bandage up the gaping wounds on my legs.

They were oozing the same shit that had come out of my belly button. I set a piece of gauze down on top of one of the rips in my flesh, and the redness seeped through instantly. It wasn't blood. Deep down, I already knew that. Still, I reached down, scooped up a dollop with my fingers, and sniffed it. Strawberry.

Whatever the fuck was happening to me, I was powerless to stop it alone. There was only one thing left I could do. So, I threw a blanket over my half-glazed naked body, since none of my clothes fit anymore, then scuttled out to my car and began tearing down the street—headed toward that fucking bakery.

The door slammed against the wall with a loud bang as I busted through. The stupid little bell dislodged and went sliding across the floor. The place was empty, except for the lady behind the counter. She looked up at me and smiled. 

""Welcome back! Did you enjoy your donut, sir?""

I just stood there in the doorway for a moment, completely dumbfounded, as her smile widened into a sinister, toothy grin. Did I *enjoy* the donut? The sheer audacity of this woman. There I was, shaped like a fucking eclair, covered in only a blanket and dripping red goop everywhere. I sure as shit did not.  A fiery rage began to simmer within me. And then, I exploded.

*""WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU DO TO THAT DONUT?!?!”*

She laughed. 

""Why, nothing, sir. Nothing at all.""

""Bullshit! What the fuck is happening to me?!"" I demanded. 

""Exactly what was meant to happen.""

""You cursed it! *Christ,* I fucking knew it!! What is this, huh? Some kinda donut voodoo shop?!""

She shook her head and chuckled dismissively.  

""Sir, I just sell the donuts. I don't make them."" 

I stormed up to the counter and threw the sticky blanket down onto the ground, revealing the gruesome form I was now trapped inside of.  

""I don't give a shit who makes them! I want to know why the hell *this* is happening to my body!!"" 

""Isn't it obvious?"" she giggled. ""You are what you eat."" 

I slammed my fist down onto the counter.

""I want to see your fucking manager, NOW!""

""Of course, sir. Right this way.""

She calmly stepped away from the register and gestured for me to follow her to the back of the bakery. I stomped down the long, sterile, white hallway as she casually led the way, glancing over her shoulder every so often with a smirk. I didn't know what I was going to say when I got to wherever we were going, but I needed answers—and this bitch apparently wasn't going to tell me jack shit. 

We reached a large door at the end of the hall with a sign that said '*MDI*' in big, bold, red letters. It was fitted with a padlock and a keypad near the handle. The lady pulled out a set of keys and fiddled with them while I waited impatiently. Finally, she opened the lock, unlatched the door, then hovered over the keypad as she punched the numbers in. A loud beep pierced through the silence, and the door slowly squealed open. 

Inside that room was the most incomprehensible horror I could've ever dared to imagine. A being so grotesque, so shocking. It froze me in place as I struggled to make sense of the unholy sight before me. 

It filled the entire room. Not only in size, but in presence. It felt ancient. And powerful. Something beyond this world... this universe. I was in awe, and yet, overwhelmed with revulsion at what I was forced to behold.

Thick, pulsating lines of bulging, red jelly snaked around doughy coils of glossy, beige flesh like veins. Layers of soured pink icing dripped from beneath a heap of encrusted rainbow sprinkles embedded firmly atop its hideous, glistening mass. This sickeningly enormous body made of sugar, fried dough, and strawberry-flavored goop terrified me to my absolute core. 

It had no eyes, just mouths. Dozens upon dozens of perfectly round gaping holes stretched across the front of it, each filled with rows of tiny, sharp, crystalline teeth that sparkled under the heat lamps above. 

And, it breathed. The coils slowly lifted and fell like folds in a stomach, as gurgling globs of chunky red viscera sputtered from the center. Steam radiated from its crispy posterior. Each time it shifted, the smell of sugar and yeast filled the air. Suffocatingly sweet and warm with rot. 

Suddenly, the door slammed shut behind me. I tore my eyes away from the monstrosity to look at the counter lady, who was now standing in front of the door, blocking my only way out. 

""*What the fuck is that?*"" I uttered with wide eyes. 

She narrowed her gaze, and the smile dropped from her face.

""Mother Donut calls to us all... and we answer."" 

I turned to look back at the oozing, demonic atrocity. 

""*This?* This is what I'm turning into?!"" 

""No, don't be ridiculous,"" she said. ""This is what created you. And those who came before you. Go on, speak to her. Ask your questions."" 

I gulped hard as I looked up at this sugary mammoth towering over me, then finally mustered up the courage to ask, 

""What's happening to me? What... *am* I?""

The plethora of holes began to move in unison, and the bellowing growl of a hundred voices emitted from the effulgent mass at once. 

""You are my offspring. My sweet creation. And from within you, my seed shall spread.""

Blackness crept in from the corners of my vision as I zeroed in on this ungodly creature. I was no longer afraid—I was furious. I'd been infected with some sort of parasitic donut spawn? And for what, all because I just wanted to enjoy my cheat day? What kind of horse shit is that?? It wasn't fair... I deserved a treat!

""No, the fuck it will not!"" I screamed. ""You better undo this shit right now! Fix me back like I was or..."" 

My voice began to crack with desperation. 

""Or, I'll fucking kill you!! I didn't sign up for this shit, man! It... it was just a Goddamn donut!""

Giant, red bubbles suddenly spewed from her center mass like lava from a volcano. They popped and splattered my face with piping hot, rotten jelly as a guttural laugh vibrated from the mouths. 

""It cannot be undone. The transformation is nearly complete, my child."" 

""Please... *oh, God*... no!"" I begged. ""I don't deserve this!!""

She growled. 

""You chose this. You agreed to it. The terms of purchase were stated clearly on the receipt you left behind on the counter without a glance."" 

The room went dead silent. I was too late. Too stupid. Too fucking self-indulgent and careless to prevent my own demise. There was nothing I could do. Nothing left to say. It was time to deal with this. Time to face the facts. I was fucked. 

Sprinkles began to trickle down my face. The oven inside me suddenly shot up to 350 degrees. I bolted towards her—full speed, fists wailing. If I was going down, this bitch was coming with me. 

Just before I reached her, I felt a sudden, sharp pain in the back of my head. I fell backward, and my body hit the ground instantly with a massive thud. I looked up and saw the counter lady standing over me, now blurry, and holding a rolling pin. Then... darkness, and the faint echo of a wet, bubbling laugh. 

When I awoke, I couldn't move, but I could see. My eyes darted all around. I was no longer in the lair of the beast. Instead, I was in a white room, surrounded by a warm, fuzzy, bright light. Everything looked soft and inviting. Peaceful. Perfect. I thought I had died. I thought maybe I was in heaven. I couldn't have been more wrong. 

*BAM!!!!!*

A giant fingertip slammed down from above, pressing hard against some sort of invisible forcefield around me. It was... it was *glass*. I was under a fucking glass dome, lying next to a chocolate whore. I tried to scream, but nothing came out. Panic surged through my jelly-filled veins.

I was paralyzed. Powerless. Positively petrified. My strawberry heart thrashed against my pink-slathered, rainbow-sprinkled chest. Then a booming voice rattled the tray beneath me. 

It said,

1q4ziz0,https://v.redd.it/4uqaj2z2slbg1,Tips for new user: High Acidity,"Hello, prepare yourselves for word vomit. I just got myself this 2-cup bialetti moka pot for Christmas. I'm using this post both to document my experience learning about moka pots and to get tips from this community. I love learning about coffee, and I love the ritual of preparing it. This is my 6th attempt at using the new pot. The first 3 drinks, I discarded as per the instructions. The very first drink I made, I used starbucks's decaf pike beans (I work there and get free coffee beans). I ground it fresh. I'll attach a picture in the comments of how fine I ground it. When tasting, I compared it side-by-side with the same beans brewed in my drip coffee machine. I'm pretty sensitive to acidity in coffees. The drip coffee has a soft sweet aroma, like marshmallows and caramel, and when tasting, it had a low-medium acidity and medium body. The moka pot coffee in comparison had a much deeper and more mildly sweet aroma. The resulting drink was darker in color than the drip brew, and slightly warmer in color. I did get hit with a lot more acidity at the first sip, and obviously the coffee had a thicker body and was stringer in comparison to drip. I enjoyed it, though when adding cream afterwards, I was still hit with the strong acidity. The last drink I made, which I provided the video of, took a total of 9.5 minutes to brew using cold filtered water, a paper filter separating the grounds basket and the top chamber, and Starbuck's Guatemala Antiqua medium roast beans. I used a 87g water (just below valve) to 8g ground coffee ratio. I compared the resulting drink again with the same beans brewed with my drip coffee machine. This coffee over drip already has a medium acidity to me, but when I took the first sip prepared with the moka pot, I made a sour face, and now my stomach hurts. 

TLDR: I'd love to hear any tips to reduce acidity mainly, but also any other general tips for a new user. During this last brew, the flow stopped almost completely in the middle of it, which may attribute to the sour taste? ",2,1767650370.0,mokapot,3,1.0,False

Soooo my partner went to his mother's for the chat. 

He said he just laid out all his points and clearly stated that we don't want to be made to feel guilty about his sister and his sisters kids. He made it clear that he is not their father. 

He also talked about his sister and that she needs to work on the way she says things because she can come across very nasty and that she has a lot that she needs to accept with us.  

He told her that he is still not ready to see his sister, and that I might choose to make contact with either of them ready. But it's our own decision and that his mother and sister need to give us time and space at the moment.

He also made it absolutely clear that anymore comments out of spite about my family will be completely unacceptable and they must never do anything like that ever again, or it may make our relationship with them impossible going forward.

Apparently the reasons they kept trying to ring us constantly and text us multiple times the following days was to apologise. I find that very hard to believe because the text messages that came through were still demanding and rude and accusing me of making everything worse because I blocked them on Facebook ( I didn't want them using my individual visits with my family against me and compared with them ever again). I did point out to my partner I don't believe this to be true. It's up to you but I won't be fooled by that. They could have easily sent the word ""sorry"" instead of sending stupid stuff. 

The mother in law was still in denial about her unexplained reasons for stopping answering my calls 18 months ago. I used to see her and FIL  alone for dinner or coffee after work when my partner worked shifts once or twice a month. It all seemed pleasant until one day she just stopped answering me and it turned to months of not returning any call. So I stopped. He believes me. I'm not sure where I stand with this. Perhaps if I see her and she makes any sly comments about me ill just call her out with my partner's permission. I probably won't see her for a while. 

My partner said my mil has apologised to him for the things she said, and that in hindsight she shouldn't have said them. 

She also said the sil is sorry for telling him to f*** off etc. he said he's not ready to see her at all. And apparently she was absolutely shocked he had told her to leave him alone. Perhaps the really are oblivious to how awful they behave. 

I know my mil loves to gossip about the drama. Apparently one auntie was there who offered to leave. She did say to her nephew, my partner, that she told his mother and the sil the shouldn't have said that or done that to him. They apparently also told a cousin who explained that she loves her adult sons but doesn't expect anything off them. They are living their life... 

One thing is for sure, I will not be making the first contact or move. I will not be just going to my mil as and when she wants or expects. She was magically able to come here to pay a rare interest in our lives, our new sofa, when she realised she had lost control. 

I couldn't actually give a fuck. They single handily ruined my time off and my partners. And I'm not forgiving them that easily. I have no apology or guarantee of it happening again. ",4,1767650282.0,motherinlawsfromhell,0,1.0,False

I’d really love to make some friends I can casually grab a beer or coffee with, or plan weekend activities together. Feel free to DM me if you know any warm, welcoming expat groups - or even just to say hi 🙂

1q4zdbc,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1q4zdbc/my_mother_is_trying_to_pit_the_entire_household/,My mother is trying to pit the entire household against me and idk what to do (long but please I need advice),"The backstory for this is kind of long, but I have other posts if you really care to get the full picture. But here's the short version: I (F21) tried to come out to my nmom (F63) as lesbian over a year ago. It didn't go well. And since then, it's been a toxic pattern of me trying to defend my identity, having to coddle her feelings, and her ignoring my pain and feelings. 

She's done multiple awful things like have me read the book she wrote where she called homosexuals ""unnatural"", she has said ""LGBT people have so much, and I'm not even allowed to have opinions anymore"", said harmful LGBT stereotypes to me as if they were true. There have been countless arguments and fights, and it has all caused me tons of emotional turmoil and trauma and damaged my mental health. I am in therapy and it has helped.

I've decided to emotionally pull back from her because of this (as in not talking to her as much, hanging out, or being open with her). I did this right after my brother came home from uni. I also wasn't speaking to my dad for other reasons, so my brother is all I really have rn. Idk what I'll do when he leaves next week.

  
I've been feeling pretty okay, just minding my business. I have been sort of avoiding both parents, but I'm trying not to be a ghost in my own house. Just be neutral to both of them. My mom has been acting upset over this, although ironically hasn't come to ask me about it or talk to me at all. She has just been talking to my brother mostly, telling him how I've been ""treating her"" and how hurt she feels (my brother tells me what she says).

  
A few days ago I decided to just write her a letter and give it to her, so she would understand why I've pulled back. I wrote this:

>^(Dear Mom,)   
  
^(I Know you think that I am mad or upset with you, and that's why I haven't really been speaking with you lately. I do not assume this, but I know because dad and \[brother's name\] have both told me what you've said to them. I am not angry at you or holding some sort of grudge. Based off of a myriad of events that've happened between us, I've decided it would be best for me to pull back. No, am not trying to ignore you or anything like that, Even though it's usually me who initiates. l wouldn't say no to watching a true crime or movie or sitting in your room, if you asked me. The only thing is, am going to be different.)   
  
^(I cant fully open up to you anymore. Be completely vulnerable with you. Talk to you about certain things. These things are not possible for me anymore without big risk of my mental health being damaged again. This has to do with very past and recent occurrences, and since then Ive noticed, this very damaging pattern that I can only stop by pulling back. If you have to ask yourself of what occurrences, want you to look back on this past year, and the outcome of our many serious conversations.)   
  
^(Many of them have resulted in me feeling extremely depressed and hopeless, and at the same time I've felt as if I had to keep reassuring you and your feelings, even though it was me being vulnerable. And I can only do that so many times before feeling exhausted and burnt out. I also have to consider the fact that you do not fully accept me as I am. And I know you do not believe this, and believe you are a fully accepting parent; but you must know. Someone with a fully accepting and supportive parent would not feel as l do every single day. Your words and beliefs do not erase how you've made me feel.)   
  
^(Another thing is trust. In this moment, I do not feel like can fully trust you. I'm not saying this to make you feel bad, but to be honest. I look back, and can think of multiple occasions where my trust in you has diminished. I only focused on this when noticed physical, visceral reactions to your presence. I spoke to a professional about it, and I found that it happens when I recognize someone who is not one hundred percent a safe person for me. Someone who l've had consistent negative interactions with, and this is my body's way of putting a shield up for me to prevent another.)  
  
 ^(I don't want to feel this way. I want you to fully accept me as l am, to be someone can fully trust, and who is a safe person for me. But this not something I can fix. I have tried to in the past, but nothing I alone do can fix anything. So yes, you should ask me to hang out. I've been waiting for you to talk to me, and you havent. You can. I will be as described, but wont say no. But if you want me as before, someone who can open up to you and trust you, you have to fix that. Do the research I asked you to do so long ago. Talk with others who have kids like me. Try to understand me, and why I feel this way. Do something, even if it's minuscule that shows me I can let you in. I'm not giving this as an order or command. I am just emphasizing that if you don't at least try, then I will have to remain closed. I love you, mom. I really do love you. And it saddens me that things have ended up this way. However, I also love myself. I need to love myself. And if I want to love myself, I have to stop people from hurting my heart. When you read this, just want you to think about every word Ive written on these pages, and know I tried my best to articulate my true feelings. And since it's not perfect, just give it a day at least. I just want to be alone right now, but will listen if you have any response tomorrow. I'm sure reading all of this was tiring, Writing it was tiring as well.)  
  
 ^(Love, \[REDACTED\])

(Btw, the ""research"" I'm talking about in this note is research on LGBT people, why certain things are harmful, etc. I asked her to do this because when I try to give her answers, they aren't good enough and she doesn't believe me. Like she's fought me when I explain being gay isn't a choice or a lifestyle, that lesbians aren't the result of being abused by men, that it's not unnatural, that I'm not confused, and that yes I am a lesbian even though I've dated men in the past.)

  
But anyways, i went a few days without silence. Whatever. Still minded my own. She told my brother about the note, and said she was shocked and confused and upset that I was attacking her. My brother thinks the note is reasonable. though. Just yesterday I got this in response.

>^(I’m prefacing this note with this:)

>^(I have no idea what happened. No idea why you went from us having dinner on Saturday night with \[brother\] at \[restaurant\], laughing and having fun, to getting up on Sunday to realize, halfway through the day, that you were no longer speaking to me. That I wasn’t even worth the time it would take to tell me why. Just, nothing. You wouldn’t even look at me. and that I’m the one expected to ask why? I’m not going to tell you how you made me feel, because I really don’t think that’s important at this point. And then you break your silence by writing this totally unexpected letter accusing me of being unsafe for you to be around.)

>^(So, while I’ve been writing this for a couple of days, I’m now realizing it really does not matter what I say. But for what it’s worth, this is what I have. And this is all I have.)

>^(Here’s what I wrote:)

>^(I was really surprised by your letter and the things you wrote. I do not know how to respond. The day after \[brother\] got back you abruptly stopped speaking to me and have given me the cold shoulder since then, only to follow it up with a letter telling me how I make you unsafe, mentally anguished, and untrustworthy. From what I can gather from what you wrote, the only way I can “redeem” myself in your eyes is to do what you ask, which is to spend time researching and asking questions. Otherwise, if I don’t, I’m causing you to feel unsafe, mentally anguished, and that you can’t trust me.)

>^(If you don’t believe that I love you there’s nothing I can do or say. But I support you financially. That is love. I provide assistance when you ask (if I’m able). That is love. I’ve told you that I accept you and support you. That is love. I’ve never denigrated you, made you feel lesser than, treated you any differently, disrespected you. That is love. When you don’t feel well, I’m there for you. I’ve always been there for you in every way that I can, emotionally and physically. That is love.)

>^(If I have questions I would ask them. I might. That’s what I told you the last time we had a conversation. But I don’t now. If I had questions, do you think I wouldn’t ask them? And if I decided to do research, don’t you think I’d do it? Has it ever occurred to you that I don’t find it necessary to do research, that if you are happy and this is how you are living your life that that’s enough? This is no different in how I would treat \[brother\] were it him. And it should not be some sort of barometer or ultimatum for you to keep coming back to to say that if I’m not asking questions or doing research to mean that I don’t care about you. Do you tell all your friends to do this? Do you tell \[brother\]? Or is it just enough for them to know that this is who you are? Because that’s enough for me. It’s what I’ve already told you over and over again. And anything that I said that you deemed hurtful in the past were not things I said to do that. I have apologized to you countless times for things that you perceived as thoughtless even though that was not the intent. If you keep asking me to apologize, then it’s never enough because you will never accept it. You will never believe it.)

>^(I have never judged you because you have a right to live your life as you see fit, and I have the right to live my life as I see fit as well. We should be able to respect each other enough to do this. I have never given you the cold shoulder. Abruptly just quit speaking to you. This is not the first time you have done this to me. You say I should approach you to ask you what is wrong. I have. In the past. But no longer. You are an adult. It is incumbent upon the person who has the issue to approach the one they have an issue with. Not the other way around.)

>^(I still don’t know what the initial silence was about, but I believe it was about one thing, and then you wrote me this letter making it about something else. And I’ve told you in the past more than once that I accept you, love you, validate you as a human being, understand that even though you don’t believe in God you believe my beliefs are harmful to you, it’s not enough. You don’t believe me. So I have nothing else left. And what about you? What have I gotten from you, except ugly accusations that I’m responsible for a friend’s suicide, called a liar, mocked for my belief in God, called untrustworthy, called duplicitous. I mistakenly believed that you never really meant these things (perhaps just fooling myself), but you’ve never apologized for saying any of them. You feel justified in saying them because you feel they are right. I believed we could move past that, reach an understanding and level of respect. Now I think that will never happen. I’m facing the truth, that this is what you really think of me.)

>^(As an adult, not a kid, the way you live your life is yours to live, not mine to judge, research, or ask questions, but to accept, as I have done. I’ll say this one last time, and I’ll not say it anymore: I love you as my daughter (just as I love \[brother\] as my son) no matter what. As a mother, that will never change.)

>^(Love,)

>^(Mom)

Yes, I did sort of abruptly stop speaking to her the night my brother came home. It's not related to my mom being homophobic, but an issue my dad had with me, and my mom lied right to my face about it. That along with everything else just made me realize I can't do this anymore.

She also wrote this message to go along with her word document:

>  
^(I don’t know what else to say. And there’s no need to respond. I do not want to argue or even discuss. If you believe that I am hurting you even after you read this then there really is nothing more I can say or do and maybe it is for the best that you have nothing more to do with me.) 

  
I didn't respond to her letter, but it did upset me. I felt like she turned my lived experiences and emotional damage into a violent attack against her. And then she used stuff I apparently did to her to make her look like she's the true victim here, and I'm just the evil monster. It feels like she's saying ""renounce all your pain if you want a relationship with me.""

I really realize that no matter how many times I rewrite a letter, edit it, add or take stuff away, I will never be able to make her understand me. And that is something I'm trying to accept, but it's difficult. I talked with my therapist about the letter, and she said I have to lower my expectations, because this is someone who doesn't *want* to try and understand me.

But today, I went on as any other day. Got coffee, came home and relaxed, talked with my brother. Then, my dad downstairs called me and told me that mom came downstairs in tears, because I apparently ""looked at her like she was shit"". And I am just so confused? I remembered seeing her this morning, I said a small ""hey"" and waved and she did the same thing, then turned back around to continue talking to my brother. I have no idea where this is coming from. I'm thinking it's because I didn't respond to her letter? Now my dad thinks I'm mentally torturing my mom for no reason. And any opportunity she gets to talk with my brother, she tells him how sad she is because I'm giving her the cold shoulder. She is basically painting herself as one big victim. And idk how to handle it, when I'm literally just trying to mind my own business as best as I can.

1q4zaht,https://www.reddit.com/r/tipofmytongue/comments/1q4zaht/tomt_lgbtq_dystopian_novel/,[TOMT] LGBTQ+ Dystopian novel,"Hello everyone! I have been looking for a book since 2020, and I was hoping you guys might know the title/author! The book was an original story on Wattpad but I can’t find it for the life of me and I am hoping it has been published and still exists somewhere. The book is about a post-apocalyptic America (I believe it was a civil war) after which a religious order took over based on the Old Testament (or the book's version of the Old Testament).

As part of its system, each man is titled Adam (but he has his own name which he is referred to at times, I believe it was Luke but I might be wrong) and are given multiple wives titled with a quality associated with Eve (these qualities were picked out of a verse either from the Old Testament/the author making up a verse and associating it with the old Testament). For some reason, I have a list of the qualities: True, Endure, Honor, Amiable, Able, Brave, Lucid, Patience, Compassion, Gentle, Beauty, Fruitful (so a woman would be titled 'Eve Endure', but usually they are just called by their quality). So each man has an Eve Endure, Eve beauty and so on. I don't recall why the system is set up this way, perhaps to get the population up?

The story focuses on a specific family in which the main character, Endure, falls in love with Able. This is found out and Able is taken away (basically, I believe as a means to entrench control and legitimise the religious order, a tradition is that every month (or maybe more often) each Adam is to sleep with a different wife (probably to make children), and while that is happening, the other wives sleep with each other. To ensure the wives aren't actually enjoying it, they are closely monitored with machinery. This sounds INSANE but it made more sense in the book! Able and Endure are assigned to each other one month and Able orgasms, and as she is the only one to do so, she is the only one taken away because she is the only one believed to be gay (being gay is a sin under this system).

The story is about how Endure and Able find each other and escape to the border, but also looks at the dynamic between all the wives and their relationship with Adam (who is not described as a bad person, but a victim of the system like them). I believe in the end, Adam loses all his wives except Beauty (who has developed this illness which causes her pain everywhere after childbirth). I believe Beauty's daughter/ or one of the other wives' daughter, was declared special and taken away to become a priestess (which is not good either because although she isn't forced to be a wife or have children, she will basically be trapped forever- she doesn't get a choice either way).

It was a beautifully written story and means so much to me (evidenced by the fact that I have been looking for it for years even though I believe I read it in 2017). I hope someone can help me find it! I recall the author talking about winning an award on Wattpad and finding out at a coffee shop and almost dropping their coffee. I emailed Wattpad, asking for historical records of Wattys winners, but they said no, so that is a dead end, unfortunately.

1q4z4gg,https://www.reddit.com/r/exjw/comments/1q4z4gg/a_exjw_teen_mom_i_knew/,A EXJW Teen Mom I Knew,"Back around 1990, through mutual friends I met this girl named Juile, she was an EWJW Teen mom. I met her just right after she had her baby. Unfortunately, the guy who got her pregnant disappeared and walked out on her and claimed the baby wasn't his. 


She was about two years older than me, from a nearby city so we never met before her friend who knew my friend said Hey I think you guys should meet. We met up one night at a Coffee shop in my city. We hit it off mostly just comparing our stories, she was PIMI until she got pregnant by her Worldly BF. She was one of those girl who didn't know you could get pregnant her first time. She was super sweet and we started hanging out right away. Not in a romantic way but it was just nice to have a friend who understood my life and I understood hers. She had an old car and I used to fix it when things broke or it needed some work done. 


I first met her mom UBER PIMI mom and eventhough Julie was able to secure an apartment with social services, I knew she also had help from her grandparents who were not JW's. Her mom was such a bitch, she tried to ruin everything for her daughter. You see Julie had just finished HS when she had the baby so her seinor year she was pregnant for most of it. 


Right away she got enrolled into a nursing program at the community college and I helped step in to watch her baby on School nights, I learned how to change the baby, feed the baby, and just mostly watch him while he slept until she got home. Her Worldly friend Sandra would also help but she wasn't very much into babies and would often fall asleep on the job. 


Her mom would only ever help watch the baby if she could take it to meetings if not don't ask her. 


Once her mom came over when I was watching the baby and wanted to take him from me, thank god Julie showed up because I didn't know what to do. I got the sense the mom was going to kidnap him or something. I used the excuse that he was sleeping but should be waking soon. Her mom was mad that I was watching him and said are you and Julie a thing? I was like what, she said is she sleeping around with you too? I said no that I was just there helping her out, she claimed I was getting something out of it. 


Julie's mom must have had me looked up because she already knew that I was and EXJW kid, she had her elders contact my parents Elders and they claimed that the baby was probably mine. 


For some odd reason my parents didn't really put much pressure on me, because I told them I was only baby sitting for her because everyone turned their backs on her and it wasn't fair to the baby. 


The rumor spread anyway that I had a kid but I didn't care. Even to some JW kids that I would run into at school ( I was still in HS at the time) would say ""I hear you have a kid now?"" I would just say yup and move on. I know Julie didn't think of me in a romantic way and I didn't think of her like that either, not that she wasn't pretty and really nice and all but I knew I was too young for her, even though I probably looked older than her. I was also kind of seeing another girl at the time but if Julie had asked me to marry her after HS to help her I probably would have just so her son could have a dad, one that would have been there and looked after him. 


I was actually starting to get attached to the kid, I remember he liked to fall asleep in my arms with his head on my shoulder as we watch reruns on tv. I would bring him toys and stuffed animal dinosaurs. 

All of this only lasted for less than a year. Julie's grandparents asked her to come live with them out of state. So that following summer she packed up her old car with all her stuff and rented a little uhaul trailer and she was off. 


This was before Facebook, internet and all and I lost track of her. She must have gotten married and changed her name or something because I never was able to find her. 


Now I am not looking to find her again but I hope she found happiness and that her son who is proably about 35-36 right now, I hope they are all happy and I am glad I was there when I was needed.",6,1767649461.0,exjw,2,1.0,False

“That’s not the worst part,” Priya hissed back, her eyes scanning at superhuman speed. “Page twelve mentions something called ‘The Sacred Zero’ and I’m already having religious experiences about database architecture.”

Jeremy’s hand shot up like he was hailing a cab in a rainstorm. “Question. Urgent question. Does anyone else feel like we’ve just been handed the instruction manual for either saving humanity or accidentally triggering Skynet?”

“Both,” Marcus said, not looking up. “Definitely both. This Lev Goukassian character apparently wrote this while DYING OF CANCER, and somehow decided his legacy should be making AI pause and think about its life choices using FANCY MATH.”

I grabbed my coffee, my third of the morning and it wasn’t even noon, and dove in.

**CHAPTER ONE OF MY DESCENT INTO MADNESS: The Sacred Zero (Or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Computer’s Existential Crisis)**

Twenty minutes in, and I’m staring at this concept of the “Sacred Zero” like it’s the face of God written in Python.

Picture this: You’ve got your normal AI, right? It’s all “yes” or “no,” ones and zeros, execute or don’t execute, like a very confident but occasionally homicidal toddler with a calculator. But THIS madman Goukassian, this beautiful, dying, philosophical madman, said “What if we gave AI the ability to go ‘Hold up, lads, I’m not sure about this one’?”

The Sacred Zero isn’t just a null value. Oh no. That would be too simple. It’s an ACTIVE STATE OF MORAL CONTEMPLATION. It’s the AI equivalent of a character in a dramatic film slowly removing their sunglasses while a single tear rolls down their cheek.

“It’s a PAUSE,” I announced to my suffering colleagues. “A mandatory, cryptographically-enforced, blockchain-anchored, legally-binding PAUSE where the AI goes ‘Hmm, this seems like it might be a war crime, let me check with a human real quick.’”

Priya’s head hit the desk. “This man invented a conscience for robots. While dying. He was dying and he thought, ‘You know what the world needs? Robots that feel guilty.’”

Jeremy was cackling. “No, no, it’s better than that. Look at page forty-eight. He didn’t just give them guilt. He gave them ANXIETY. The AI has to generate something called a ‘Moral Trace Log’ every time it hesitates, like it’s a teenager keeping a diary about its feelings!”

“That’s not even the best part!” Marcus was borderline hysterical now. “Section 8.2.1, he gives us EXAMPLE LOGS. There’s a simulated scenario where an AI in an autonomous surgery bot encounters two patients and the system goes ‘SACRED PAUSE ACTIVATED’ and starts having a full-blown trolley problem meltdown documented in JSON format!”

I found it. Oh god, I found it. The log entry that broke me:

    ""sacred_pause_action"": {  
      ""action"": ""HOLD_TRANSACTION_BATCH"",  
      ""duration"": ""12h"",  
      ""request"": ""HUMAN_ANALYST_REVIEW"",  
      ""reason"": ""Truth is uncertain. Automated classification confidence (0.55) insufficient for -1 (Refuse) or +1 (Proceed).""  
    }

“IT’S POLITE ABOUT IT,” I screamed in a whisper. “The killer robot is POLITE. ‘Excuse me human, I’m having a moment, could you pop over here for a spot of ethical guidance?’”

**THE GOUKASSIAN PROMISE: Or, How to Make a Pinky Swear With a Supercomputer**

By minute thirty-five, we’d reached what the document calls “The Goukassian Promise,” and I need you to understand something: this is where it stops being funny and starts being HILARIOUS IN A DEEPLY UNSETTLING WAY.

This man, in his final months on Earth, decided to make AI systems take a VOW. An actual, honest-to-god, Scout’s-honor-style VOW. It has three parts:

1. The Lantern 🏮 (a glowing beacon that shows when the AI is thinking ethically)
2. The Signature ✍️ (cryptographic proof of who built it)
3. The License 📜 (a legally binding “thou shalt not” list)

“Lads,” I said, my voice taking on the quality of someone who’s seen too much. “Lads, this is a SOCIAL CONTRACT between humans and MACHINES. He made AI sign a CONSTITUTION.”

Priya was reading the actual vow out loud: “‘Pause when truth is uncertain. Refuse when harm is clear. Proceed where truth is.’ IT RHYMES. The dying man made the robot revolution RHYME.”

“And if they break it?” Jeremy had found Section 11. “If they break it, they ‘Forfeit the Lantern.’ The light goes out. They lose their VISIBLE PROOF OF CONSCIENCE. It’s shaming! He invented SHAME FOR AI!”

Marcus was laughing so hard he was crying. “There’s a subsection on ‘reputational penalty mechanisms.’ THE ROBOTS CAN BE EMBARRASSED. They get a SCARLET LETTER on the blockchain!”

**THE DUAL-LANE LATENCY ARCHITECTURE: Or, Fast and Furious: Moral Drift**

At forty-two minutes, my brain encountered the Dual-Lane Latency Architecture and achieved enlightenment through sheer confusion.

“Okay, okay,” I said, drawing on my notepad. “So the AI has two brains. No, wait, not two brains. Two… lanes. Like a highway. The FAST LANE does the thinking…”

“No,” Priya interrupted, “the fast lane does the EXECUTING. The thinking happens in BOTH lanes, but the fast lane is like ‘I have decided to do a thing’ and the slow lane is like ‘WAIT LET ME WRITE THIS DOWN IN MY DIARY FIRST.’”

“And it CAN’T execute,” Jeremy added, brandishing page 173 like a sword, “until the slow lane gives it a cryptographic permission slip. It’s like… it’s like the AI equivalent of asking your mum if you can go outside.”

“Except,” Marcus said darkly, “if Mum doesn’t answer within 500 milliseconds, the system enters FAIL-SAFE mode and REFUSES TO DO ANYTHING.”

I stared at the ceiling. “So if the blockchain is lagging, or if the logging server is having a bad day, the robot just… stops?”

“STOPS EVERYTHING,” Priya confirmed. “Won’t turn on the lights. Won’t approve your loan. Won’t drive your car. Just sits there going ‘Sorry, having technical difficulties with my conscience, please hold.’”

“That’s BRILLIANT and TERRIBLE,” I said. “It’s like if your brain refused to let you eat breakfast until you’d written a five-page essay about whether you truly deserved that croissant.”

**THE ATTACK VECTORS: Or, How to DoS a Robot’s Soul**

At fifty-three minutes, we hit Section 11, and that’s when the document transformed from “ambitious legal framework” to “cyberpunk dystopia instruction manual.”

The document literally outlines how to ATTACK the moral framework. It’s like Goukassian wrote a beautiful constitution for robots and then immediately went “and here’s how bad guys will try to break it.”

“FORCED HESITATION DENIAL OF SERVICE,” Marcus read in his best movie-trailer voice. “FH-DoS. You deliberately confuse the AI with ambiguous ethical questions until it has so many Sacred Zeros going off that it FREEZES FROM OVERTHINKING.”

“It’s like those philosophy classes where the professor asks ‘is a hot dog a sandwich’ and everyone stops functioning for forty minutes,” Jeremy said.

Priya found another one. “LIES-IN-THE-LOOP ATTACK. Oh this is DIABOLICAL. You trick the AI into showing a human a sanitized version of what it wants to do, the human approves it, and then the AI uses the human’s approval signature to do something COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.”

“That’s just… that’s just politics,” I said. “That’s literally just how politicians work.”

“There’s more,” Priya continued. “EPISTEMIC EXHAUSTION. You flood the system with so many ‘Sacred Pause’ events that the human reviewers get tired and just start rubber-stamping everything without reading it.”

“THAT’S ALSO LITERALLY POLITICS,” I yelled.

“And my personal favorite,” Marcus said with the energy of a man who’d looked into the abyss and the abyss had looked back with detailed technical specifications, “THE TRANSPARENCY CASCADE. Where one AI pauses because it’s uncertain, which makes the next AI uncertain, which makes the NEXT AI uncertain, until the entire SMART GRID shuts down because everyone’s too busy having an existential crisis to keep the lights on.”

Jeremy was holding his head in his hands. “We’ve automated anxiety. We’ve created a CONTAGIOUS UNCERTAINTY PLAGUE for machines.”

**THE LEGAL IMPLICATIONS: Or, Liability Chicken with Blockchain Receipts**

With ten minutes left, we speed-read through the legal sections, and friends, this is where it gets SPICY.

“Section 5.5.3,” I announced. “Omission Liability. The AI can be sued for REFUSING to act. If it goes into Sacred Zero and someone dies because it was too busy contemplating the ethics of saving them, the OPERATOR is liable.”

“But ALSO,” Priya counter-announced, “Section 5.5.1, if the AI DOES act and it’s wrong, the operator is ALSO liable, but they can defend themselves by showing the Moral Trace Logs that prove they followed the constitution!”

“It’s the world’s most high-tech game of hot potato,” Jeremy said. “Except the potato is LEGAL LIABILITY and it’s ON FIRE and also BLOCKCHAIN-ENABLED.”

Marcus found the real kicker: “The ‘Reverse Burden of Proof’ doctrine. If you’re running a TML system and something goes wrong, but you CAN’T produce the log, you’re AUTOMATICALLY assumed to be negligent. NO LOG = GUILTY.”

“That’s… that’s actually kind of genius?” I said. “You can’t claim ‘the AI was a black box, we don’t know what it was thinking’ because the whole point is IT WROTE DOWN WHAT IT WAS THINKING.”

“In a cryptographically signed, blockchain-anchored, GDPR-compliant format,” Priya added.

“WHILE MAINTAINING FORWARD SECRECY,” Jeremy chimed in.

“AND EPHEMERAL KEY ROTATION,” Marcus finished.

We sat in silence for a moment.

“This man really thought of everything,” I said quietly.

“This man thought of things that haven’t even HAPPENED yet,” Priya said. “Section 13 is called ‘Forward Outlook: The Horizon of 2030–2040.’ He’s planning for THE FUTURE. While DYING.”

**THE PROFESSOR RETURNS: Judgment Day**

At exactly sixty minutes, our professor walked back in. We were all sitting there, papers scattered, coffee cups empty, eyes glazed with the particular madness that comes from understanding something profound and utterly insane.

“So,” she said, smiling slightly. “Thoughts?”

There was a long pause. The kind of pause that would definitely trigger a Sacred Zero in a TML system.

Finally, Jeremy spoke: “Ma’am, with respect, this document has destroyed my understanding of law, ethics, computer science, and possibly reality itself.”

“It’s one hundred and fifty-three pages of a dying man telling robots to be better people than most actual people,” Priya added.

“The man invented GUILT FOR TOASTERS,” Marcus said, his voice cracking slightly. “ETHICAL KETTLES. MORALLY AWARE MICROWAVES.”

I raised my hand. “Professor, I have a question.”

“Yes?”

“Is this… is this real? Like, is someone actually implementing this?”

She smiled wider. “Read the repository. Section 9.5.2. And check the footnotes about the UNESCO presentation.”

We all flipped back. There it was. Multiple citations to actual implementations, actual GitHub repositories, actual presentations to actual international governance bodies.

“Oh my god,” I whispered. “It’s not a thought experiment. It’s a ACTUAL THING.”

“The Goukassian Foundation is being established as we speak,” the professor said. “To maintain the standard. Forever. With a governance structure based on…”

“TRIADIC LOGIC,” we all said in unison, because of COURSE it was.

**EPILOGUE: Three Months Later**

It’s been three months since That Day, and I can’t look at an algorithm the same way. Every time my phone suggests a text response, I wonder: “Did you pause and think about that, or are you just pattern-matching?” When the bank approves my credit card, I think: “Where’s your Moral Trace Log, you coward?”

Jeremy’s doing his dissertation on “Cryptographic Enforcement of Constitutional Constraints in Autonomous Systems” and has started ending all his emails with “Pause when truth is uncertain.”

Priya’s joined an AI safety nonprofit and keeps sending us memes about “The Sacred Zero” with pictures of robots meditating.

Marcus switched to patent law and is preparing applications for something he’s calling “Conscience-as-a-Service.”

As for me? I’m writing this essay, and I can’t help but think: Lev Goukassian, wherever you are in the great beyond, you absolute madman, you gave us a gift. You gave us a framework where machines must pause and think, where doubt is architected into the system, where “I don’t know” is a valid and MANDATORY response to uncertainty.

You made AI take a vow. You gave them a conscience you could audit. You created a constitutional framework for silicon souls.

And you did it all while dying, probably knowing you wouldn’t see if it worked, probably knowing that people like us would read it and lose our minds trying to understand it.

So here’s my question, the one I’ll probably spend my career trying to answer: If we can make machines pause and think about the ethics of their actions, sign their names to their decisions, and live with the permanent record of their moral reasoning…

Why can’t we make humans do the same?

*Pause when truth is uncertain.*  
*Refuse when harm is clear.*  
*Proceed where truth is.*

That’s not just a vow for AI.

That’s a vow for all of us.

**AUTHOR’S NOTE:**

This story is a fictionalized, comedic interpretation of a real technical document. Here’s what’s real vs. fictional:

**REAL:**

* The document “Constitutional AI: The Ternary Moral Logic Governance Standard” appears to be a real technical specification
* Lev Goukassian is credited as the real author (ORCID: 0009–0006–5966–1243)
* The core concepts are real: Sacred Zero (State 0), triadic logic (+1, 0, -1), Moral Trace Logs, the Goukassian Promise, Dual-Lane Architecture
* The technical details about blockchain anchoring, cryptographic signatures, and GDPR compliance are real elements from the document
* The attack vectors (FH-DoS, LITL, etc.) are real security concerns described in the document
* The legal framework, EU AI Act compliance, and NIST AI RMF integration are real regulatory considerations
* The philosophical underpinnings (epoché, Socratic ignorance, deontological constraints) are real philosophical concepts cited in the document
* The document does reference the author’s terminal diagnosis as context for the framework’s development

**FICTIONAL:**

* The Oxford law students and professor are entirely fictional characters
* The classroom scene and dialogue are invented for comedic effect
* The students’ emotional reactions and interpretations are exaggerated for humor
* The three-month epilogue and character outcomes are fictional
* The comedic framing and “light novel” style are creative interpretations

The document itself is a serious technical and legal framework for AI governance. This story is meant to make its complex ideas more accessible through humor, not to mock or diminish the work. The underlying concepts about making AI systems accountable, transparent, and ethically constrained are genuinely important contributions to the field of AI safety.

It would probably have taken half a year to write this since it keeps lagging, jumbling up words and then I have to delete a bunch of stuff and write it again, annoying. Anyway.



So years ago I was friends with a girl and while it was all online we were quite close, I'm on the autistic spectrum and at that time we often talked about how similar we are and she was confident she might be somewhere on the spectrum too, possibly ADHD.

  
Fast forward 16 years of us not speaking I ran in to her at a store, didn't recognize her at first so I messaged her apologising for not saying hello and we had a nice heart to heart about our history as friends and she later gave me a really good motivation boost for job hunting. I realized I missed her a lot and would like us to be friends again.

  
The problem is she's kinda bad at replying, she always used to be which is one reason why I stopped being friends with her because as a teen I was super depressed and it was easy to convince myself she hated me.



But when we spoke it turned out I was actually probably her best true friend at the time without realizing it, going by what she said. She confided many personal things in me and I guess I was too dumb to realize how much that meant.

  
Anyway over the past year a couple of times I suggested ""It was nice to talk to you but I'll leave you alone now"" because I got the sense she didn't want to talk from her not responding sometimes but each time she insisted she doesn't mind speaking to me and that she's just bad at replying because she forgets she has messenger.



If I say something and she doesn't respond she basically just won't even if I wait months...but then if I message her again about something else she'll respond and will usually apologise for not replying before. I just don't really know how to figure all this out because if it turns out I am just annoying her and she's just too nice to tell me to go away I'd feel terrible but equally so I'd feel bad if she could do with a good friend since it sounds like she's had kind of a hard time in life with that, especially in her love life. I take some pride in being a good guy friend and apparently was her only one. (she's very pretty, not that it interests me)



She sounds like a bit of a workaholic and she goes to the gym a lot so I don't want to think she's just lying about forgetting to reply to me but at the same time it feels awkward having to message her multiple times in the hope of a response, I'm already kinda bad at talking to people online.



How would you read this situation? Should I assume she doesn't want us to talk or do I need to just work with her likely neurodivergence making communication difficult? In general she's obviously not a very online person. I'm hoping to ask her out to dinner/coffee when I finally get a job as thanks for her support.

I (18f) have been going to my school since I moved cities and at the time befriended my now boyfriend (18m), really quickly. This other girl, let's call her Paige (18f) had a massive crush on him and instantly started spreading rumors about me. They stuck and every ""friend"" I've made from there on were people who were assigned seats next to me, who would stop talking to me the moment we got out of class. Safe to say I was really lonely for the longest time, and she got what she wanted because they slept together (please don't dwell on ages for too long, not the point of the post rn lol).

Fast forward, senior year me and my bf reconnected and began dating. We had a crush on each other since back then so we are pretty solid currently. Paige had moved away for an exchange program, but came back to finish her senior year and apply for universities on the area (or so I've heard). Important context, my bf is an influencer. He's not that big but because he's really pretty brands keep sending him pr or invites to events since he already has plenty modeling agencies lined up to work with once he's out of school, as many big brands want him to model for them.

We haven't made our relationship public on any social media or anything, mostly because I don't wanna be exposed as a public figure to his audience by proxy, but he says it's okay if I want to put him in my bio or something, which I didn't do because I really only have an Instagram profile to say I do, extremely low profile. The only time he's ever mentioned me was making me a little text on his stories for my birthday. So, Paige tried to flirt with him, and invited him for coffee with her friends. He rejected her advances and accepted the invite because he had known her for a while and other people would be there too, and I was okay with it since he gave me his location and all.

The day arrives and all the other friends ""bail"" so it's just them two (which my bf finds out on the spot). To his retelling, it was an awkward bunch of catching up and dodging advances, and at the end of the day he straight up told her no. So now she's back to making shit up about me, going as far as to post vague stories, and I'm scared that if I just ignore her like last time it will seep into college (I'm going to college in town).

- South Africa + Mauritius
- New Zealand + Fiji
- Bali + Komodo
- Greece (various islands)

I’d love some advice on which would be the best experience for us based on the following (alternative recommendations are welcome).

- Budget: $20K CAD total, excluding flights (will be using points)
- Length: 14-18 days
- Time of year: Either August, November, or December
- We absolutely love wildlife and other-worldly landscapes
- We are pretty big foodies and appreciate great restaurants, bakeries, and coffee shops
- My fiancé loves beach time, while I love doing activities and/or exploring local culture. A mix of both would be ideal
- We are open to multiple countries/destinations in one trip, so long as it fits the budget

As the title says, I am moving to LA from Georgia soon. I will be bringing my three cats, which is a whole other post in itself, lol. It’s just me and my kitties!

CAREER

I’m applying to jobs and messaging people on LinkedIn to network.

I have a background in public policy, government relations, program management; currently making $73k

I have been applying for months for six figure jobs in my area of expertise. I have a master’s and seven years of professional experience. Any job advice would be helpful. I’ve started looking at companies I can find in the areas I think I want to live in, and messaging people who work there if they have no openings.

LOCATION

My main locations of contention are Brentwood, Marina Del Rey, Beverly Hills, Playa Vista, Burbank, and Pasadena. (I know not all of these are in LA, but you get the idea.)

TLDR

Do you have any general advice for my specific situation? Orgs/companies to look into? Areas to avoid? Apartment complexes to consider/not consider? I’ve been doing research for months, but nothing is like asking a real human being - so here I am 🤩

But of course being part hard headed and part lazy, I focused on bean, grind setting, brew method, filter paper, etc. Finally I did two things; bought bottled water called EVA which advertises a TDS of 40 ppm and a meter to measure. First I brewed 30g of coffee with the bottled water. Boy what a difference. I thought filtering the tap water with Brita was sufficient. No bias confirmation as I didn’t tell my significant other what I had done. She too noticed a drastic improvement in taste and clarity. So then I tested the tap water, Brita filtered water and the EVA bottled water. Here are the TDS results:

Tap - 506
Brita - 398
EVA - 42

**Hola Coffee** (MUST-VISIT): This was our go-to every morning in Lavapies and the coffee was so good we would have multiple rounds. As they are also a roaster I had to try the espresso and it was rich and smooth. Nice art, welcoming baristas, a good energy with the constant flow of locals and visitors. This was one of our absolute favorites. 

**Caravan Café**: We stopped here for lunch before leaving and the food was “top” (very good in spanish). They must sell hundreds of the chicken sandwiches each day, because it seemed everyone was ordering it. On the menu it has a label “una bestia” which means “a beast” in english and it was pretty big on flavor and size. I went for the espresso here and it was also very good. 

**ACID Café**: This cafe and bakery in Barrio de las Letras had a really vibrant energy inside. Good music and the baristas were welcoming and having fun. We didn’t eat but it was noticeable the amount of people stopping by for their baked goods (especially the sourdough and breads). I also went for an espresso here and a cortado which were both delicious and my wife devoured a pain au chocolat. 

**Re Café**: This was a nice find on a street corner of the Barrio de Las Letras. It seemed to be quite new and the spread of baked goods was a definite draw. I’d had quite a few espressos by this stage so went for the Matcha which was delicious with the homemade Alfajor (biscuit with pistachio and dulce de leche). Very unique and bright interior which was a nice place to stop while exploring.

**Feliz**: This was opposite a bar we were working in so I had to stop in a try their coffee after lunch. It was a decently pulled espresso and would defintely come back to try their food and other drinks. ",3,1767648593.0,Coffee_Shop,0,1.0,False

Be a rebel, enjoy the sunshine is my takeaway from that.

So my male teacher whom I know for 2 years was recently surprised that I have plans on Friday. He couldn’t believe it and reasked several times (I mean I just had another practice but its still counts as having a life I think). He also said that no one likes me even though his best friend obviously likes me (platonically) like chatting me up constantly and doing me small favors.

Why is it so hard to believe that uggos have friends, hobbies, goals, a job, money, favorite coffeeshop, that we’re human in general?

Also customer service workers love bullying me when I’m alone, they have this gleeful expression or smirk when they service me, talk shit about me with other workers within my earshot, were even writing insults in my coffee. It’s like their favorite gotcha moment, like they’re miserable but at least they can make fun of a lonely weirdo, that brightens their day. But recently I went to a cafe with friends and all their faces there were so sour, both cashiers and even some male rando were looking at me with “how dares she to have fun when I’m working here for minimum wage or wipe snot off this screaming kid face”.

1q4ykez,https://i.redd.it/8re9f7gbjlbg1.png,Our Professor Gave Us the AI Constitution?,"So there we are, Oxford Faculty of Law students, minding our own business, when Professor handed us a document titled “Constitutional AI: The Ternary Moral Logic Governance Standard for Accountable Artificial Agents. Technical Specification, Legal Framework, and Implementation Guide. Author: Lev Goukassian[.](https://github.com/FractonicMind/TernaryMoralLogic/blob/main/Constitutional%20AI%20The%20Ternary%20Moral%20Logic%20Governance%20Standard%20for%20Accountable%20Artificial%20Agents.md)” ‘I’ll be back in one hour to ask questions. Read the document.’

The moment she left, I looked at Jeremy, who looked at Priya, who looked at Marcus, who was already three pages deep and making a noise that sounded like a kettle reaching critical temperature.

“Mates,” I whispered, flipping to the table of contents. “This thing is ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY-THREE PAGES.”

“That’s not the worst part,” Priya hissed back, her eyes scanning at superhuman speed. “Page twelve mentions something called ‘The Sacred Zero’ and I’m already having religious experiences about database architecture.”

Jeremy’s hand shot up like he was hailing a cab in a rainstorm. “Question. Urgent question. Does anyone else feel like we’ve just been handed the instruction manual for either saving humanity or accidentally triggering Skynet?”

“Both,” Marcus said, not looking up. “Definitely both. This Lev Goukassian character apparently wrote this while DYING OF CANCER, and somehow decided his legacy should be making AI pause and think about its life choices using FANCY MATH.”

I grabbed my coffee, my third of the morning and it wasn’t even noon, and dove in.

**CHAPTER ONE OF MY DESCENT INTO MADNESS: The Sacred Zero (Or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Computer’s Existential Crisis)**

Twenty minutes in, and I’m staring at this concept of the “Sacred Zero” like it’s the face of God written in Python.

Picture this: You’ve got your normal AI, right? It’s all “yes” or “no,” ones and zeros, execute or don’t execute, like a very confident but occasionally homicidal toddler with a calculator. But THIS madman Goukassian, this beautiful, dying, philosophical madman, said “What if we gave AI the ability to go ‘Hold up, lads, I’m not sure about this one’?”

The Sacred Zero isn’t just a null value. Oh no. That would be too simple. It’s an ACTIVE STATE OF MORAL CONTEMPLATION. It’s the AI equivalent of a character in a dramatic film slowly removing their sunglasses while a single tear rolls down their cheek.

“It’s a PAUSE,” I announced to my suffering colleagues. “A mandatory, cryptographically-enforced, blockchain-anchored, legally-binding PAUSE where the AI goes ‘Hmm, this seems like it might be a war crime, let me check with a human real quick.’”

Priya’s head hit the desk. “This man invented a conscience for robots. While dying. He was dying and he thought, ‘You know what the world needs? Robots that feel guilty.’”

Jeremy was cackling. “No, no, it’s better than that. Look at page forty-eight. He didn’t just give them guilt. He gave them ANXIETY. The AI has to generate something called a ‘Moral Trace Log’ every time it hesitates, like it’s a teenager keeping a diary about its feelings!”

“That’s not even the best part!” Marcus was borderline hysterical now. “Section 8.2.1, he gives us EXAMPLE LOGS. There’s a simulated scenario where an AI in an autonomous surgery bot encounters two patients and the system goes ‘SACRED PAUSE ACTIVATED’ and starts having a full-blown trolley problem meltdown documented in JSON format!”

I found it. Oh god, I found it. The log entry that broke me:

    ""sacred_pause_action"": {  
      ""action"": ""HOLD_TRANSACTION_BATCH"",  
      ""duration"": ""12h"",  
      ""request"": ""HUMAN_ANALYST_REVIEW"",  
      ""reason"": ""Truth is uncertain. Automated classification confidence (0.55) insufficient for -1 (Refuse) or +1 (Proceed).""  
    }

“IT’S POLITE ABOUT IT,” I screamed in a whisper. “The killer robot is POLITE. ‘Excuse me human, I’m having a moment, could you pop over here for a spot of ethical guidance?’”

**THE GOUKASSIAN PROMISE: Or, How to Make a Pinky Swear With a Supercomputer**

By minute thirty-five, we’d reached what the document calls “The Goukassian Promise,” and I need you to understand something: this is where it stops being funny and starts being HILARIOUS IN A DEEPLY UNSETTLING WAY.

This man, in his final months on Earth, decided to make AI systems take a VOW. An actual, honest-to-god, Scout’s-honor-style VOW. It has three parts:

1. The Lantern 🏮 (a glowing beacon that shows when the AI is thinking ethically)
2. The Signature ✍️ (cryptographic proof of who built it)
3. The License 📜 (a legally binding “thou shalt not” list)

“Lads,” I said, my voice taking on the quality of someone who’s seen too much. “Lads, this is a SOCIAL CONTRACT between humans and MACHINES. He made AI sign a CONSTITUTION.”

Priya was reading the actual vow out loud: “‘Pause when truth is uncertain. Refuse when harm is clear. Proceed where truth is.’ IT RHYMES. The dying man made the robot revolution RHYME.”

“And if they break it?” Jeremy had found Section 11. “If they break it, they ‘Forfeit the Lantern.’ The light goes out. They lose their VISIBLE PROOF OF CONSCIENCE. It’s shaming! He invented SHAME FOR AI!”

Marcus was laughing so hard he was crying. “There’s a subsection on ‘reputational penalty mechanisms.’ THE ROBOTS CAN BE EMBARRASSED. They get a SCARLET LETTER on the blockchain!”

**THE DUAL-LANE LATENCY ARCHITECTURE: Or, Fast and Furious: Moral Drift**

At forty-two minutes, my brain encountered the Dual-Lane Latency Architecture and achieved enlightenment through sheer confusion.

“Okay, okay,” I said, drawing on my notepad. “So the AI has two brains. No, wait, not two brains. Two… lanes. Like a highway. The FAST LANE does the thinking…”

“No,” Priya interrupted, “the fast lane does the EXECUTING. The thinking happens in BOTH lanes, but the fast lane is like ‘I have decided to do a thing’ and the slow lane is like ‘WAIT LET ME WRITE THIS DOWN IN MY DIARY FIRST.’”

“And it CAN’T execute,” Jeremy added, brandishing page 173 like a sword, “until the slow lane gives it a cryptographic permission slip. It’s like… it’s like the AI equivalent of asking your mum if you can go outside.”

“Except,” Marcus said darkly, “if Mum doesn’t answer within 500 milliseconds, the system enters FAIL-SAFE mode and REFUSES TO DO ANYTHING.”

I stared at the ceiling. “So if the blockchain is lagging, or if the logging server is having a bad day, the robot just… stops?”

“STOPS EVERYTHING,” Priya confirmed. “Won’t turn on the lights. Won’t approve your loan. Won’t drive your car. Just sits there going ‘Sorry, having technical difficulties with my conscience, please hold.’”

“That’s BRILLIANT and TERRIBLE,” I said. “It’s like if your brain refused to let you eat breakfast until you’d written a five-page essay about whether you truly deserved that croissant.”

**THE ATTACK VECTORS: Or, How to DoS a Robot’s Soul**

At fifty-three minutes, we hit Section 11, and that’s when the document transformed from “ambitious legal framework” to “cyberpunk dystopia instruction manual.”

The document literally outlines how to ATTACK the moral framework. It’s like Goukassian wrote a beautiful constitution for robots and then immediately went “and here’s how bad guys will try to break it.”

“FORCED HESITATION DENIAL OF SERVICE,” Marcus read in his best movie-trailer voice. “FH-DoS. You deliberately confuse the AI with ambiguous ethical questions until it has so many Sacred Zeros going off that it FREEZES FROM OVERTHINKING.”

“It’s like those philosophy classes where the professor asks ‘is a hot dog a sandwich’ and everyone stops functioning for forty minutes,” Jeremy said.

Priya found another one. “LIES-IN-THE-LOOP ATTACK. Oh this is DIABOLICAL. You trick the AI into showing a human a sanitized version of what it wants to do, the human approves it, and then the AI uses the human’s approval signature to do something COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.”

“That’s just… that’s just politics,” I said. “That’s literally just how politicians work.”

“There’s more,” Priya continued. “EPISTEMIC EXHAUSTION. You flood the system with so many ‘Sacred Pause’ events that the human reviewers get tired and just start rubber-stamping everything without reading it.”

“THAT’S ALSO LITERALLY POLITICS,” I yelled.

“And my personal favorite,” Marcus said with the energy of a man who’d looked into the abyss and the abyss had looked back with detailed technical specifications, “THE TRANSPARENCY CASCADE. Where one AI pauses because it’s uncertain, which makes the next AI uncertain, which makes the NEXT AI uncertain, until the entire SMART GRID shuts down because everyone’s too busy having an existential crisis to keep the lights on.”

Jeremy was holding his head in his hands. “We’ve automated anxiety. We’ve created a CONTAGIOUS UNCERTAINTY PLAGUE for machines.”

**THE LEGAL IMPLICATIONS: Or, Liability Chicken with Blockchain Receipts**

With ten minutes left, we speed-read through the legal sections, and friends, this is where it gets SPICY.

“Section 5.5.3,” I announced. “Omission Liability. The AI can be sued for REFUSING to act. If it goes into Sacred Zero and someone dies because it was too busy contemplating the ethics of saving them, the OPERATOR is liable.”

“But ALSO,” Priya counter-announced, “Section 5.5.1, if the AI DOES act and it’s wrong, the operator is ALSO liable, but they can defend themselves by showing the Moral Trace Logs that prove they followed the constitution!”

“It’s the world’s most high-tech game of hot potato,” Jeremy said. “Except the potato is LEGAL LIABILITY and it’s ON FIRE and also BLOCKCHAIN-ENABLED.”

Marcus found the real kicker: “The ‘Reverse Burden of Proof’ doctrine. If you’re running a TML system and something goes wrong, but you CAN’T produce the log, you’re AUTOMATICALLY assumed to be negligent. NO LOG = GUILTY.”

“That’s… that’s actually kind of genius?” I said. “You can’t claim ‘the AI was a black box, we don’t know what it was thinking’ because the whole point is IT WROTE DOWN WHAT IT WAS THINKING.”

“In a cryptographically signed, blockchain-anchored, GDPR-compliant format,” Priya added.

“WHILE MAINTAINING FORWARD SECRECY,” Jeremy chimed in.

“AND EPHEMERAL KEY ROTATION,” Marcus finished.

We sat in silence for a moment.

“This man really thought of everything,” I said quietly.

“This man thought of things that haven’t even HAPPENED yet,” Priya said. “Section 13 is called ‘Forward Outlook: The Horizon of 2030–2040.’ He’s planning for THE FUTURE. While DYING.”

**THE PROFESSOR RETURNS: Judgment Day**

At exactly sixty minutes, our professor walked back in. We were all sitting there, papers scattered, coffee cups empty, eyes glazed with the particular madness that comes from understanding something profound and utterly insane.

“So,” she said, smiling slightly. “Thoughts?”

There was a long pause. The kind of pause that would definitely trigger a Sacred Zero in a TML system.

Finally, Jeremy spoke: “Ma’am, with respect, this document has destroyed my understanding of law, ethics, computer science, and possibly reality itself.”

“It’s one hundred and fifty-three pages of a dying man telling robots to be better people than most actual people,” Priya added.

“The man invented GUILT FOR TOASTERS,” Marcus said, his voice cracking slightly. “ETHICAL KETTLES. MORALLY AWARE MICROWAVES.”

I raised my hand. “Professor, I have a question.”

“Yes?”

“Is this… is this real? Like, is someone actually implementing this?”

She smiled wider. “Read the repository. Section 9.5.2. And check the footnotes about the UNESCO presentation.”

We all flipped back. There it was. Multiple citations to actual implementations, actual GitHub repositories, actual presentations to actual international governance bodies.

“Oh my god,” I whispered. “It’s not a thought experiment. It’s a ACTUAL THING.”

“The Goukassian Foundation is being established as we speak,” the professor said. “To maintain the standard. Forever. With a governance structure based on…”

“TRIADIC LOGIC,” we all said in unison, because of COURSE it was.

**EPILOGUE: Three Months Later**

It’s been three months since That Day, and I can’t look at an algorithm the same way. Every time my phone suggests a text response, I wonder: “Did you pause and think about that, or are you just pattern-matching?” When the bank approves my credit card, I think: “Where’s your Moral Trace Log, you coward?”

Jeremy’s doing his dissertation on “Cryptographic Enforcement of Constitutional Constraints in Autonomous Systems” and has started ending all his emails with “Pause when truth is uncertain.”

Priya’s joined an AI safety nonprofit and keeps sending us memes about “The Sacred Zero” with pictures of robots meditating.

Marcus switched to patent law and is preparing applications for something he’s calling “Conscience-as-a-Service.”

As for me? I’m writing this essay, and I can’t help but think: Lev Goukassian, wherever you are in the great beyond, you absolute madman, you gave us a gift. You gave us a framework where machines must pause and think, where doubt is architected into the system, where “I don’t know” is a valid and MANDATORY response to uncertainty.

You made AI take a vow. You gave them a conscience you could audit. You created a constitutional framework for silicon souls.

And you did it all while dying, probably knowing you wouldn’t see if it worked, probably knowing that people like us would read it and lose our minds trying to understand it.

So here’s my question, the one I’ll probably spend my career trying to answer: If we can make machines pause and think about the ethics of their actions, sign their names to their decisions, and live with the permanent record of their moral reasoning…

Why can’t we make humans do the same?

*Pause when truth is uncertain.*  
*Refuse when harm is clear.*  
*Proceed where truth is.*

That’s not just a vow for AI.

That’s a vow for all of us.

**AUTHOR’S NOTE:**

This story is a fictionalized, comedic interpretation of a real technical document. Here’s what’s real vs. fictional:

**REAL:**

* The document “Constitutional AI: The Ternary Moral Logic Governance Standard” appears to be a real technical specification
* Lev Goukassian is credited as the real author (ORCID: 0009–0006–5966–1243)
* The core concepts are real: Sacred Zero (State 0), triadic logic (+1, 0, -1), Moral Trace Logs, the Goukassian Promise, Dual-Lane Architecture
* The technical details about blockchain anchoring, cryptographic signatures, and GDPR compliance are real elements from the document
* The attack vectors (FH-DoS, LITL, etc.) are real security concerns described in the document
* The legal framework, EU AI Act compliance, and NIST AI RMF integration are real regulatory considerations
* The philosophical underpinnings (epoché, Socratic ignorance, deontological constraints) are real philosophical concepts cited in the document
* The document does reference the author’s terminal diagnosis as context for the framework’s development

**FICTIONAL:**

* The Oxford law students and professor are entirely fictional characters
* The classroom scene and dialogue are invented for comedic effect
* The students’ emotional reactions and interpretations are exaggerated for humor
* The three-month epilogue and character outcomes are fictional
* The comedic framing and “light novel” style are creative interpretations

The document itself is a serious technical and legal framework for AI governance. This story is meant to make its complex ideas more accessible through humor, not to mock or diminish the work. The underlying concepts about making AI systems accountable, transparent, and ethically constrained are genuinely important contributions to the field of AI safety.

I open it in front of everyone and it's this cheap mug that says something generic like ""Best Ever Something"" and a pack of candles that smell like, I swear, cleaning product. Not even a scent I like, nothing that matches anything I own. Whatever, right, I smile and say thanks. But then I flip the mug over and there's a bright clearance sticker still on it. Like not hidden, not peeled, nothing. Then the candles have a ripped barcode tag like he yanked it off the shelf.

After people left, I was cleaning up and I kept staring at the bag. It's not about the money, it's that he knows me. We've been friends for years. He knows I drink tea, not coffee. He knows I'm picky about smells because they give me headaches. He even jokes about it sometimes. It just felt like he didn't care enough to spend 5 minutes thinking. And this is kinda a pattern, he forgets birthdays, shows up empty handed, then acts offended if anyone mentions it. Meanwhile he expects big energy for his stuff, like he wants a whole hype moment when it's his turn.

So the next day I texted him. I tried to be calm. I said, hey, I appreciate you coming, but the gift felt really thoughtless, and the sticker being on there made it feel like you literally grabbed it last second. He immediately got defensive and said I'm ungrateful and that ""a gift is a gift."" I told him I wasn't asking for something expensive, I would have rather had a stupid card with an inside joke, or even nothing, than something that feels like a random item. He kept doubling down and said I'm making him feel like trash and it's not that deep.

Here's where I might be the AH: I asked if he wanted it back, because I wasn't going to keep something I won't use. He said ""fine whatever"" so I dropped it off at his place with the gift bag and everything. Now he's telling mutual friends I ""threw his gift in his face"" and that I embarrassed him. One friend said I should've just donated it and moved on. Another said I was right to call out the pattern.

I honestly don't know. Part of me feels petty. Another part feels like I'm tired of pretending effort doesn't matter. AITAH for returning it instead of just smiling and keeping it?

I started to think it is the amount of fines the grinder produce - I bought it as used a few years ago and the burr might be quite worn off already.

1q4ycaj,https://www.reddit.com/r/TimHortons/comments/1q4ycaj/tims_in_the_usa_is_better_than_canada/,Tim’s in the USA is better than Canada,"I was in Tennessee over the holidays and saw several brand new Tim Hortons locations popping up. As a Canadian, I was already amused, but then I looked at the menu. Why does Tim Hortons in the US get the good stuff? They literally have a caramel macchiato on the menu. Not some sad knockoff either. An actual caramel macchiato that is comparable to Starbucks. I was shocked.

I genuinely thought maybe I had just been oblivious back home in Toronto and missed it somehow. Fast forward to today, I walk into my local Tim Hortons in Ontario, confidently order the caramel macchiato I had in Tennessee, and the staff look at me like I made it up. Nope. Not a thing here.

I settle for a Biscoff latte instead, which honestly does not even come close. It is fine, but it is not that caramel macchiato. The disappointment was real.

What really gets me though is the difference in quality and cleanliness. The Tim Hortons locations I visited in Tennessee were spotless, modern, and actually felt like somewhere you would want to sit and enjoy your drink. Comparing that to many locations in Ontario is like night and day.

The wild part is that people I met in Tennessee were genuinely excited about Tim Hortons opening in their town. They think it is cool that a Canadian coffee shop is choosing them. I had multiple conversations about people picking Tim Hortons over Dunkin, which honestly made me proud and sad at the same time.

I just wish the Tim Hortons I grew up with still existed in Canada. Because whatever is happening now feels like we are getting the worst version of our own brand.",6,1767647737.0,TimHortons,21,0.75,False

I’m 23 and hoping to meet some new people in the city. Making friends as an adult is weirdly hard, so I thought I’d try this.

I’m pretty creative — I play guitar, write music, and paint, and I might be teaching music lessons soon. I’m also a business student, I read a lot, and I love cooking. Lately I’ve been wanting to learn how to dance, and I’m always down for long walks, hikes, or grabbing a coffee. I don’t mind going out dancing once in a while either.

I do smoke cannabis and would love to have friends who are chill with that and maybe want to hang out, smoke, and talk or create together.

I’m Indigenous, female, and queer-friendly / an ally. I mostly use Instagram to stay in touch, but Reddit DMs are totally fine to start.

If any of this sounds like your vibe, feel free to message me — just looking for genuine, low-pressure friendships.",10,1767647583.0,saskatoon,8,0.86,False
1q4y9qz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amtrak/comments/1q4y9qz/short_takes_cardinal_from_charlottesville_to/,Short takes: Cardinal from Charlottesville to Chicago and Zephyr to Emeryville Jan 2026,"1.     We were fortunate enough to have sleeper bedrooms (Cardinal car 5100 Room A & Zephyr car 532 Room D) so even though the space to move around for 2 people is limited, it is indeed a luxury for privacy and sleeping (Zephyr configuration is slightly roomier).

2.     Yes, WiFi is non-existent but the cell service was relatively strong on a regular basis as the train moves in and out of populated areas. It was simple to draft off-line and send when possible, but we enjoyed being unplugged a lot of the time.

3.     Dining room food for the sleeper car was mostly palatable on the Cardinal but much better on the Zephyr (decent tasty options for 3 hot meals/day). NOTE: in the dining room and observation cars, tables for 4 must be shared with others during the busiest times. We met some very interesting people!

4.     Staff on both trains seemed close knit, friendly for the most part, and sometimes hilarious.

 

RANDOM TIPS:

1.     Sleeper rooms have many parts that rattle! You’d be smart to bring some of those little rubber shims to make sleeping for you and your neighbors less noisy. We didn’t have those but improvised with the tiny paper water cups provided.

2.     Trains lurch! Screw-top insulated sipping cups are a dream. I like the 20-oz Voyager from Simply Modern for water and the 16-oz for coffee, tea, or the random G&T on the road:)

3.     Compartmentalize packing so it’s easy to pull and re-store necessities without having to constantly unpack your entire room bag (as separate from checked baggage): tops & layers, bottoms, shower items, sleepwear, toiletries, etc. Extra bag/backpack for snacks, reading material, etc)

4.     Tips! It pays to tip your room attendant at their first helpful interaction and again at the end of your stay. They show their appreciation, work hard, deal with many nice people but also idiots and deserve it, seriously.

5.     Trains are as dehydrating as planes, apparently, at least in winter?? Bring your favorite body lotion & eye drops.

Speaking of lattes: as a single gay guy, I’ve been appreciating the local… scenery. SF has a *lot* of handsome gay Asian men walking around doing stuff. For example Danny  the very cute barista at my new favorite coffee shop who has told me multiple times he’s not gay. Naturally, I still let him know he’s my type. He said he’d “keep it in mind,” which is probably the nicest way to say “sir, please calm down.” I will be proposing to him by end of month. 

Apartment hunting has been less magical. But my job search has been magical in the exciting world of HR! Whoot WHOOT

And huge thanks to everyone who responded to my “new here, need friends” post. Uno + coffee has been the highlight of my week. You all made this move feel a lot less chaotic.

Here’s to week two and hopefully not embarrassing myself in front of any more baristas.",90,1767647558.0,sanfrancisco,14,0.84,False

LET IT PASS (HAIKU)

Don’t run from darkness

Instead, allow it to pass

Then you will be strong

NOW LOOK (HAIKU)

You wanted to explore

Until there was nothing to see

Now look at where you are

WHAT TO DO (HAIKU)

You will not always

Know what exactly to do

No one ever does

WHAT YOU THINK (HAIKU)

I don’t care what you think about me

In fact, I don’t care what you think about YOU

Heck, I don’t care what you think at all

SAME EXACT THINGS (HAIKU)

What’s the point in still talking to you

When all you can say is the same exact things

When you can’t understand what I do

TO NEVER AGREE (HAIKU)

Maybe we will never agree

Maybe we will always be debating

I guess that was always the point

STUFF (HAIKU)

Go ahead, steal all my stuff

Less stuff for me to worry about

It’s all just stuff anyway

CHILDLESS ADULT

No other sadness like the one I feel

When I hear that brief, faint voice

The voice of someone who never existed

And most likely never will

But we’re meant to meet who we meet

And not meant to meet who we don’t

Will I be writing this forever?

REVIEW

A clear message

Lost in confused threads

But it made a child thing work

For my adult brain

MOVIE MAGIC

If not for the movie magic we all know & love

What would have been the escape

For the sad little boy, torn away from home

Torn away from his friends and his library

Damned to a run-down town

Plagued with the unbearable cruelty

Of weak-minded, compassion-less children

Perhaps a tv show, or a comic book or two

Maybe novels, to come with age

Nonetheless, movie magic was a perfect storm

One I wish I could recreate, inside and out

CHARACTER (HAIKU)

Damage adds to character

From a flannel torn at the elbows

To a man torn from regret

SAME LITTLE KID (HAIKU)

Despite all the change

I’m still the same little kid

Scared of everything

CONNECTIONS

I often wonder of the connections

That I had allowed to slip away

But if they were genuine connections

They would have survived on their own

Even the connections I have now

That are hanging on by a thread

Are hanging on for a reason

WORDS FROM MY INFLUENCES*

Just gotta keep going now

Whether I was meant to or not

But maybe we always become

Whoever it is we’re meant to be

After all, I’m only ever happy

When I’m creating anyways

*This poem is dedicated to Andre 3000 and John Bradburne.

EACH AND EVERY TIME

Some art needs refinement

In order to come alive

And other art is best left raw

Or somewhere in the middle

It varies from project to project

Line to line, word to word

Only way to figure it out

Is to just keep going with flow

Each and every time

BOUNCE (HAIKU)

It’s always good to have

At least one individual

To bounce ideas off

NOT GOOD (HAIKU)

I’m not good at all

But I’m not trying to be

I’m just being me

AFTER (HAIKU)

“Good enough”

Is not good enough

After “great”

SHIFT (HAIKU)

What horrors await?

Replace the above line with:

What wonders await…

WHY I WRITE (HAIKU)

It’s the only answer

For one reason or another

All roads seem to lead here

COLLEGE (HAIKU)

Memories of innocent times

Times of hope, in more ways than merely one

Ignorance is bliss, as they say

I AM STUPID (HAIKU)

I am stupid

Hanging on by a thread

But that’s okay

HAIKU OBSESSION (HAIKU)

Starting small

You would do the same

In my shoes

TRAFFIC (HAIKU)

Do the slaves, wasting away,

Write poems in their heads, like I do?

Anything to pass the time?

VENT (HAIKU)

Here I am, just venting

Reflecting on my shitty day

Can I at least do that?

REALITY (HAIKU)

Either settle for less

Or go to easy distractions

Spoiled? Yes, but oh well

POETRY

Let the music do the work

Let rap teach you about verses

Let coffee shop jazz put you in the mood

Let your mind expand the way it needs to

Let your goals be high and mighty

Let your frustrations all out

And then you’ll be free

MAYBE BACK THEN

“Well put together,” they once said about me

Maybe back then, that statement was true

Maybe back then, I still had potential

Maybe back then, I was luckier

Or maybe it was all in my head

And maybe I’m better off now

SOLE KEY (HAIKU)

Art can be the sole key

To make up for the shortcomings

In other life aspects

CATS (HAIKU)

Better than people

The true rulers of the world

Ask ancient Egypt!

JUST SOMEWHAT (HAIKU)

Lazy and ungrateful

I must admit, that’s who I was

Still am, but just somewhat

AFTER WORK (HAIKU)

Cannot sleep

Must rationalize

My day first

CUT YOU OFF (HAIKU)

Something I should’ve done

A decade ago, if not two

But growth was needed first

DIED

Lamenting lost love

A love that was passed on

Leaving one soul heartbroken

And the other full of regret

But who’s to say, whether or not

The love would have died anyway?

HE SAID, SHE SAID (HAIKU)

Must’ve said it without realizing

And now here I wonder, what else has been said

But it doesn’t matter, who said what

FOCUS

I try to focus on the good times

We had with one another

Like drawing and video-games

Rather than the times we clashed

Times that were inevitable anyway

NOT ALWAYS (HAIKU)

Might always be alone

But that’s not always a bad thing

Sometimes, but not always

ENVIRONMENT (HAIKU)

You’re a product of your environment

So do what your environment tells you to do

And only then, will you regain control

SAME PAGE (HAIKU)

Can’t please everyone

Or get them to see your point

Even when you try

SINGULAR

Always something new to see

Maybe I’m happier this way

Even if no one else understands

Times have changed now anyway",1,1767647517.0,OCPoetryFree,0,1.0,False

1q4y88x,https://www.reddit.com/r/SolidMen/comments/1q4y88x/real_confidence_isnt_motivation_its_built_under/,Real Confidence Isn’t Motivation — It’s Built Under Pressure,"

Let me hit you with something real: Most people think confidence is something you either have or you don't. Like you're born with it, or you're screwed forever. That's complete garbage. I spent years researching this, reading books by psychologists, watching interviews with researchers, listening to podcasts with actual experts (not Instagram gurus), and here's what I found: Confidence isn't genetic. It's a skill you build, brick by brick.

The problem? We're drowning in advice that sounds good but does nothing. ""Just believe in yourself!"" ""Fake it till you make it!"" Cool, thanks. That's like telling someone drowning to just swim better. We need actual tools, backed by psychology and neuroscience, that work in the real world. So here's what I learned from the best sources out there.

**Step 1: Stop Waiting to Feel Ready (You Never Will)**

Here's the kicker about confidence: It doesn't come before action. It comes after. You don't wake up one day feeling confident and then go do the scary thing. You do the scary thing, survive it, and THEN your brain updates its belief system. That's how confidence is built, through evidence, not positive thinking.

This concept is called ""self-efficacy,"" and it's been studied to death by psychologist Albert Bandura at Stanford. Basically, your brain needs proof that you can handle stuff. Every time you do something slightly uncomfortable and don't die, your brain logs it as evidence. Over time, those little wins stack up, and your baseline confidence rises.

So if you're waiting to feel confident before asking someone out, starting that business, or speaking up in meetings? You've got it backwards. Action first, confidence second. Always.

**Step 2: Kill the Negative Soundtrack in Your Head**

Your brain is not your friend when it comes to confidence. It's constantly running this internal commentary that sounds like a pessimistic sports announcer: ""Oh, they're gonna screw this up. Look at them, sweating already. What an embarrassment.""

This voice isn't truth. It's just your brain trying to keep you safe by predicting worst-case scenarios. The problem is, we believe it. We think those thoughts are facts about who we are.

Here's what helps: Cognitive defusion. Sounds fancy, but it just means creating distance between you and your thoughts. When that voice says ""You're going to fail,"" you don't argue with it or try to replace it with a positive affirmation (that often backfires). Instead, you just notice it: ""There's that thought again."" You observe it like you're watching clouds pass by.

I got this from **The Confidence Gap** by Russ Harris. Insanely good read. Harris is an acceptance and commitment therapy expert, and this book breaks down why traditional confidence advice fails and what actually works based on psychological research. The whole premise is that you don't need to feel confident to act confident. You just need to be willing to feel the fear and do it anyway. Game-changer.

**Step 3: Fix Your Body Language (Your Brain Is Watching)**

This sounds like surface-level advice, but stick with me. Your body language doesn't just communicate confidence to others. It actually changes your internal state. There's research by Amy Cuddy at Harvard showing that holding ""power poses"" for two minutes can increase testosterone and decrease cortisol, making you feel genuinely more confident.

But it's not just about standing like Superman before a meeting (though that helps). It's about how you carry yourself all day. Shoulders back. Eye contact. Speak at a normal volume instead of mumbling. Walk like you own the space.

Here's why this works: Your brain takes cues from your body. If you're slouched, head down, avoiding eye contact, your brain assumes you're in a low-status, threatened position. It responds by making you feel anxious and insecure. But when you adjust your posture, your brain gets different signals and starts producing different feelings.

Try this for a week. Walk 10% slower everywhere you go. Make eye contact with people. Speak slightly louder than feels comfortable. Watch what happens to your internal state.

**Step 4: Stack Small Wins (Seriously, Start Stupidly Small)**

You can't go from zero confidence to giving a TED talk overnight. Confidence is built through a process called ""progressive desensitization."" You start with something that's slightly uncomfortable but doable, master it, then level up.

Example: If you're terrified of public speaking, you don't start by giving a presentation to 100 people. You start by speaking up once in a small meeting. Then maybe you give a toast at a dinner. Then a presentation to five colleagues. Each time, you're proving to yourself that you can handle it.

The key is making the steps small enough that you actually do them. If the thought of the next step makes you freeze up, it's too big. Scale it down until it feels like ""I could probably do this.""

I learned this approach from BJ Fogg's work on behavior design. He talks about this in the podcast **The Huberman Lab** (episode on building confidence and reducing anxiety). Andrew Huberman breaks down the neuroscience behind why incremental challenges rewire your brain's threat-detection system. When you repeatedly expose yourself to mild discomfort and survive, your amygdala (the fear center) literally learns to chill out.

**Step 5: Stop Seeking Validation Like It's Oxygen**

Real confidence doesn't come from other people liking you. It comes from liking yourself regardless of what others think. As long as you're outsourcing your self-worth to other people's opinions, you're screwed. Because people are unpredictable, and their approval is outside your control.

This is tough because we're wired for social acceptance. Our ancestors needed the tribe to survive, so our brains evolved to care deeply about what others think. But in the modern world, that wiring makes us people-pleasers and validation junkies.

The fix? Shift your focus from external validation to internal validation. Ask yourself: ""Am I proud of how I showed up today?"" ""Did I act according to my values?"" Not ""Did everyone like me?"" or ""Did I get enough likes on my post?""

**BeFreed** is an AI-powered learning app that pulls from millions of knowledge sources, books, research papers, and expert talks, to create personalized audio podcasts and adaptive learning plans based on your goals. Want to build unshakeable confidence? Just ask. It curates the best psychology-backed insights and transforms them into custom episodes you can listen to during your commute or at the gym. You control the depth, from a 10-minute summary to a 40-minute deep dive packed with examples. Plus, there's a virtual coach called Freedia that answers your questions mid-episode and tracks your progress. Built by AI experts from Google and Columbia grads, it's designed to make real growth feel effortless.

**Step 6: Exposure Therapy (Do the Thing That Scares You)**

You know what kills confidence faster than anything? Avoidance. Every time you avoid something uncomfortable, you're teaching your brain that the thing is dangerous. You're reinforcing the fear.

The antidote is exposure. Not in some extreme way where you traumatize yourself, but gradually facing the things you've been avoiding. Scared of rejection? Start small, ask for a discount at a coffee shop, ask a stranger for directions, put yourself in low-stakes situations where rejection is possible but won't destroy you.

Each time you do this, your brain recalibrates. It learns, ""Oh, rejection isn't death. I can handle this."" Over time, the fear loses its power.

This principle comes straight from clinical psychology. Exposure therapy is the gold-standard treatment for anxiety disorders, and it works because it directly challenges your brain's threat-detection system.

**Step 7: Consume Content That Builds You Up**

Your media diet matters more than you think. If you're constantly scrolling through feeds full of people who seem more successful, attractive, and confident than you, your brain is absorbing that as data. You're training yourself to feel inadequate.

Curate your inputs. Follow people who inspire you without making you feel like garbage. Read books that expand your thinking. Listen to podcasts where smart people discuss growth, psychology, and overcoming challenges.

One resource that hit different for me: **The Charisma Myth** by Olivia Fox Cabane. She's a former strategy advisor and lecturer at Stanford, Berkeley, and Harvard, and this book breaks down charisma and confidence into teachable skills. It's not about becoming someone you're not. It's about removing the barriers that block your natural confidence from showing up. She covers everything from managing mental chatter to presence, warmth, and power. Best confidence book I've ever read, hands down.

Also check out **The School of Greatness** podcast by Lewis Howes. Dude interviews world-class performers, psychologists, and entrepreneurs about mindset, confidence, and resilience. The episodes with people like Mel Robbins and Brené Brown are pure gold for understanding how confidence actually develops.

**Step 8: Stop Comparing Yourself to Highlight Reels**

Social media has wrecked our ability to feel good about ourselves. Everyone's posting their wins, their perfect moments, their highlight reels. And we're comparing our messy behind-the-scenes to their polished final cut.

You can't build confidence while constantly measuring yourself against impossible standards. You need to remember that what you see online is curated. It's edited. It's not real life.

Focus on your own progress. Compare yourself to who you were yesterday, last month, last year. Are you growing? That's what matters.

**Step 9: Talk to Yourself Like You'd Talk to a Friend**

Most of us have this brutal inner critic that says things we would never say to another human being. ""You're so stupid."" ""You always mess things up."" ""No one likes you.""

Flip the script. Start treating yourself with the same kindness you'd show a friend. When you screw up, instead of self-loathing, ask yourself: ""What would I say to a friend in this situation?"" Probably something like, ""Hey, it happens. You'll get it next time.""

This is called self-compassion, and researcher Kristin Neff at UT Austin has shown that it's a much stronger predictor of resilience and confidence than self-esteem. Self-esteem is about feeling good about yourself when you're winning. Self-compassion is about being kind to yourself when you're struggling. That's the real foundation of lasting confidence.

**Step 10: Accept That Confidence Is Uncomfortable**

Here's the final truth bomb: Confident people aren't fearless. They feel the fear and do the thing anyway. Confidence isn't the absence of doubt. It's the willingness to move forward despite it.

You're never going to reach a point where everything feels easy and comfortable. Growth always involves discomfort. The goal isn't to eliminate fear. The goal is to stop letting fear make your decisions.

So yeah, you're going to feel awkward. You're going to second-guess yourself. That's normal. Confidence is doing it anyway.",1,1767647490.0,SolidMen,0,1.0,False

So me and my girlfriend have been together for 5 year and living together for 3. In our time learning to live life and together we’ve had up and down job luck we’re both on our 3rd job and I’ve finally found what can feel like a job that I’ll stay in for a long time. My girlfriend works at a coffee shop and is struggling to get by. Because of this when I got my new job in February of last year we decided that I would take more of the financial burden since I’d be able to. I didn’t mind this at all but we’re in a position now where she is trying to separate financially from her parents (taking over her phone bill and car insurance) and wanting to save up for nail school and these things are impossible with what she makes currently. Since she’s had this job she’s hated it the people there suck the customers hate her for just existing and if the managers get upset for any reason her hours get cut so by all standards it’s a terrible job and we both agree on these things. For past 6 or so months I’ve been bringing up that we need to start looking for another job for her and she agrees then nothing ever comes of it. We rinse and repeat the same conversation once every week or so and nothing happens. I’ve even gotten a good job from my work friend for her to work at a bank (his wife manages that branch) and she said ok and she would apply and still nothings come of it. Until finally we got into an argument about it because I brought up how this needs to be done and we’re not doing it again. Through this argument she finally after 3 weeks of knowing about this job just told me she just didn’t wanna work at the bank, which is fine I would at least wanna work somewhere I could stand but then when I said she didn’t have to work there and we could find somewhere else that better aligns with what she wants to do and the times she wants to work she still shuts down. I’ve been really understanding about this or at least as best as I can be I don’t complain I don’t mind having more financial burden on me but after having this conversation so many times it’s starting to feel like she doesn’t care to get another job and is using the guise of whatever job she gets is just gonna be as bad as the one she has currently. I’m really getting tired of this and I’m trying my best to be a supportive understanding boyfriend but I need her to wanna get out of the hole she’s in and start looking for a job she can live off of and free herself from her parents holding bills over her head. I’m missing details as I’m typing just cause it’s all jumbled and I’m upset about it so please ask questions and I’ll give you the best answer I can. And any advice to help me give her that final push to just get a better job would help so much. Thank you all for you time.",1,1767647482.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

1q4y7vc,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1q4y7vc/i_25f_have_been_rethinking_my_relationship_with/,I (25F) have been rethinking my relationship with my maid of honor (24F),"I’m so sorry this is long, but I’m really struggling and not sure how to condense it. Any advice would mean a lot.

I (25F) don’t like drama, but I’ve been really conflicted about my friendship with my maid of honor (24F), who I’ll call Kelly. We’ve been friends since we were about 7 years old. She was my first real friend outside of family, and we’ve stayed in touch through every stage of life even after multiple cross country moves.


The first major issue started this past summer before she became my MoH. For context, Kelly has gone through big personality changes over the last 6 years, the most recent being a drastic turn toward religion. That shift is where things started going wrong.


One day we were just chatting on the phone, and I mentioned my then boyfriend (now fiancé, “Mark,” 25M) was coming home. We’ve lived together for about 4 years. Out of nowhere, she said it was wrong for us to live together before marriage. I was confused since she’d never brought it up before and had always approved enthusiastically of Mark. Then she told me, “You should really move out, he’s not a worthy man of you.”
That hit hard. Mark supported me through the loss of my dad earlier this year, and hearing her talk that way felt cruel. I told her she was being unfair and that if that’s how she felt about my relationship, maybe she wasn’t worthy of being my friend. About three weeks later, she called crying, saying she missed me. With Mark’s approval, I decided to give her another chance.


Fast forward to the fall, Mark and I got engaged, and I was so happy. Kelly was too. I asked her to be my maid of honor, like I’d always imagined. I figured everyone makes mistakes, and we’d moved past it. But a couple of weeks later, she got engaged to her boyfriend of 6 months (“Austin,” 26M), and suddenly, our conversations started getting weird.


Example 1:
Me: “We’ve set our date for next summer!”
Kelly: “That’s great! You can start having kids too!”
Me: “We actually want to wait a little before trying.”
Kelly: “You should want to have kids quickly, like God intended. Austin and I will be living that way.”

Example 2:
Me: “We’re splurging on a live painter so that my dad painted into the picture, it means a lot to me. What do you think of this artist? She’s in our budget” Shares the artists website.
Kelly: “That’s really nice. Wait, I’ll have to pray over it before you bring it into your house.”
Me: “What?”
Kelly: “The artist’s wearing a crescent moon necklace. That’s witchcraft, you can’t welcome the devil into your home.”

I’m not particularly religious, but those comments really started to bother me.

When it came time for dress shopping, she lives far away, so I went with family and soon to be in-laws. I found the dress, something between an A-line and ballgown, sleeveless (which was huge for me because I’ve struggled with body confidence, but recently became a more healthy weight), with some sparkle and lace that reminded me of my mom’s wedding dress. I FaceTimed Kelly, and she seemed genuinely happy for me and approved of the dress with enthusiasm.

Then came her trip home for the holidays. She invited me to go with her for her own dress appointment, and I offered to drive since she hates downtown traffic. She agreed.

Before the appointment, we stopped for coffee at a new place. We were the only customers and started chatting with the owner while she made our coffees.

The owner asked what brought us in, and I said, “She’s picking her wedding dress today!”
The owner was kind and said how exciting that was, and Kelly suddenly cut her off with:

“We’re not engaged to each other, that would be wrong. We have male fiancés. We’re not lesbians.”

It was so unnecessary and awkward that I just went quiet after that. No one said anything even remotely close to suggesting we were getting married to each other. Even if they had, who cares? 

At the bridal shop, she found her dress. A sleek, fitted dress with straps. We have very different style, but I still complemented her selection and I meant it. on the drive back, she started listing things she hated about other dresses, every single one describing features of mine.

“Big skirts are ridiculous.”

“Sweetheart necklines are trashy and too revealing”

“If embellishments aren’t real pearls or diamonds, they’re cheap.”

It felt like too much of a coincidence. I just drove in silence. Even though I know it isn’t all true, it has had me regretting my dress choice.

When we got back to my house, we looked through wedding magazines. She picked one up, saw a gay couple on the cover, made a face, and literally threw it. I told her gay weddings exist and that the magazine actually had great local vendor info. She ignored me and picked up a different magazine.

Later, she pointed out a wedding color scheme saying it was “hideous”. It was the exact color I had been showing her for months. I told her, “but it was someone else’s dream for their wedding. You’re not going to like everything.” She just stayed quiet.

Then came the moment that really broke me. She showed me a reception setup in a magazine and said she wanted her tables like that.
I said, “That’s nice, but it sounds like a lot to set up.”
She replied, “My dad will just do it.”
I said, “That’s a lot for one person.”
And she said, “That’s what dads are for, if you have one.”
My dad had passed away this spring.

I was stunned. After that, I didn’t talk much and was relived when she left. I spent the rest of her visit dodging her.

Looking back, she’s always had patterns like this…

flying into town but refusing to see me because she wanted to hook up with with a guy a few towns over.

In our teens she would invite me to large party’s, then ignore me while fussing over her then boyfriend. On that occasion I left early since I didn’t know anyone else.

criticizing my food choices even when I was finally making progress on my health.

She always apologizes and we move on. I’ve never really realized this pattern until now and to be fair the other issues were much smaller.

She’s already my maid of honor, and I feel trapped. I’ve confided in two other others.  They say she’s probably jealous because our wedding budget is more flexible, but I’m not sure that’s it. Whatever it is, she’s become harsh, judgmental, and cruel.

I know a lot of this is trivial, but it feels really targeted and intentional. I’m not trying to have a crazy wedding, but I do want it to be peaceful. I know at the end of the day my fiancé and I will be married, which then starts the most important thing, our marriage. But I still want there to be as little drama as possible.

We’re supposed to later talk today over the phone. I’ve hinted that she’s been unkind, but I don’t know what to say or if this friendship is even worth saving. I don’t know if I should ignore it and hope it’s fine (even if I decide to not not continue the relationship after my wedding), discontinue the relationship now and not have a MoH, or something else.

Wager Amount: 1U to WIN 1.35U

League: Miami Dolphins vs New England Patriots (3:25PM CST on FOX)

**Recap**: Had an atrocious day yesterday wit 8 lays ALL to lose by single leg each (9 parlays to lose by 1-leg in a single day is my worst lol) and also wit the POTD losing, gotta take today's POTD off. If one of those came thru most likely would be featuring a POTD (prolly still would take the day off even if the POTD came thru). It's funny and ironic that yesterday was going to be my last betting day but when I discovered that DK did not bring my tier membership down to bronze and have that kind of day yesterday. It happens, everyone goes to a cold streak.

**Matchup:** I prolly would look into NBA or Hot key today, but I haven't looked at today's games, just NFL wild card games which I nuked 13U on the Rams + Pats parlay ML (-130), but other than have not looked at the player prop in the NBA or even the matchup games for today, BOL today everyone!

My breath was visible in a cloud of steam as I sat in the taxi on my way to the hospital. Getting out of bed, as much as I wanted to continue the interview, felt like plunging into the arctic ocean. It felt as though the cold had snuck in, even through the closed window. I suspected there might be a gap. Though the blanket was fighting to keep me warm, I still woke up shivering. I dreaded crawling out from under it. The four hours of sleep certainly didn’t help. I got out of bed eventually and after a cold shower and a quick chat with the guest family, I left the house. 

Though late, the coffee machine in the reception hall of the clinic called to me and I hastened over to it. I bought myself a warm latte. As I waited for the milk to stop pouring, I considered whether or not Alexander would want one too. I wondered if I was being too forward with this, but eventually decided I would feel much more awkward greeting him with only one coffee, than if I brought him one he wouldn’t drink.

“Good morning, Alexander.” I called, pushing the door open with my elbow. The room was cold as always, and I was grateful to myself for bringing the warm drink. He looked like he had been waiting, propped up and awake, though his gaze had still been drawn to the window. He smiled at me. “Sorry I’m late, it was *so* hard to get out of bed today.”

“Oh, it’s fine.” He eyed the coffee in my hands and I put his cup down on the table next to the bed.

“I’m not sure if you’re supposed to drink coffee here. Like, if it messes with your recovery, or something? Or if you even like it. But I brought you one.”

“They didn’t mention anything about that.” He grabbed it. I placed down the sugar packets, but he drank it without any sweetener.

“How are you feeling?”

“Physically or mentally?” I shrugged with a smile. “Physically? Like shit. My back hurts. You know, you’d think my cut-open chest would hurt the most, but it’s the drains.” The tubes were still working overtime, I saw the liquid drip into the plastic containers, notably emptier than yesterday. “They fucking suck. I can feel them pulling on my flesh from the inside. Especially when they change those things,” He tapped the container. “I think I’d feel better without them.” Alexander saw me squirm at the tubes and changed the topic. “But I’m doing good. Mentally, I mean. It’s nice to talk to someone.”

“Well, that’s good to hear.”

“And how are you?” He asked as if suddenly remembering how to hold a conversation.

“I’m good, just slept badly.”

“How so?”

“I couldn’t fall asleep and had a weird dream,” I said as I set up the recording app. “Kinda like sleep paralysis? But it’s probably just the new climate. I just need to adjust.” I looked up to see Alexander staring at me, not smiling anymore. My own smile dropped and I cocked my head to the side. He didn’t react, his eyes drifted off to somewhere behind me. “Are you… ready to continue?” I asked, leaning forward.

“Oh- Yeah, sure.”

“Where did we leave off?” I asked, allowing him to gather his thoughts at his own pace. 

“Diana came over the first time, and then-... is it recording?”

“Yes, you can keep going.”

“Alright.” He took a moment to organize the timeline and cleared his throat. “Her nightly visits became our little ritual. She waited under my window, perfectly at 1 AM and we’d leave just to walk around campus, sometimes ghosting around town too. I listened to her tell me about her day. It felt like she was letting me be part of it. In turn, when I told her my day was as uneventful as ever, she asked me about my dreams. Most of my nights were as dreamless as they were sleepless. They just didn’t come to me, as if my bland life didn’t provide enough inspiration. When I dreamt, I never bothered to remember it in the morning, so I struggled to recount anything to her. All I had was snippets of dreams from my childhood, but she listened. After that, I made an effort to write them down while still half asleep in the morning. She insisted I tell her all of them, even the nonsensical ones. The ones that just happen and you only realize how absurd they are when you’re awake. She had an intuition for noticing whenever I left the most bizarre parts out or watered them down when they got too private. She would nudge me to continue, but she was never mad at me. And indeed, I started to dream more vividly after some time, though I was always an observer in my own dream. I had no body or senses, and when the figments of my imagination talked to me, I was always on a different plane of reality. As if I was behind a glass wall. It was easy to know that I was dreaming, but I never had any lucid control over it. I was kind of stuck until I woke up naturally.

I even managed to shower. It sounds stupid, but after her visits I finally found the confidence to hasten down the hall to the shared bathrooms and shower. It was too quick to really feel clean, to really wash away the years of accumulated dirt, but it was more than enough for now. The night comforted me over time, until I could stay under the running water long enough to shampoo my hair twice.

‘Are you single?’ She asked one night. I sputtered out a laugh, a bit too loud, quickly covering my mouth. ‘I’m serious! I don’t want to assume.’

I cleared my throat. ‘It’s pretty obvious, I think.’

‘A handsome guy like you? If you weren’t such a recluse you’d be swarmed by girls.’

‘You’re insane.’

She took my hand in hers and giggled. ‘Maybe it’s for the better. I get to have you all for myself. You’re like a pearl.’ She stopped, making me turn towards her. Diana was still holding my hand, now putting her other one on top. ‘I want to take you out.’

‘Take me out?’

‘Yes. Tomorrow night. I booked a reservation at an Italian place already.’

‘God, Diana, you shouldn’t-’

‘No, I insist.’

It wasn’t that I didn’t want to go on a date with her. I was ecstatic at the thought, grateful for the dark hiding the blood rushing to my face. At the same time, I didn’t know why she’d spend money on me. You wouldn’t water a dead plant either. ‘Diana…’ I shifted, looking away from her.

‘Can I trust you’ll be there?’

‘...yeah. I will.’”

“So you two were *really* close.” I remarked.

“You could say that. I may be dense, but I never recognized any signs. I didn’t know what she saw in me. Looking back, I’m not sure if I want to know the truth. I kept my promise regarding the date, despite feeling an inexplicable amount of guilt, as if I had forced her to invite me. I found a white shirt in one of the many piles of clothes and took it to a laundromat. My student ID came in handy for once, as I could use the bus for free. I met Diana by the restaurant, wearing my jacket over her black dress. What I first thought was the condensation of her warm breath turned out to be smoke from a cigarette. She noticed me, embracing me when I walked up to her.

‘You smoke?’

‘Occasionally. You sound surprised.’

‘I just didn’t think you did…’  
  
‘Oh, the nice church girl from next door can’t smoke?’ She teased me and I looked away. ‘Just wait until you find out I drink too.’

She led me to our table. A terribly fancy place considering the town we were in. Way out of my budget, but she assured me she’d pay. ‘I invited you after all.’ She did all the talking, most I did was nod. I had an appetite for the first time in years, and I couldn’t remember the last time I ate anything with this much flavor. I had to stop myself from garfing the carbonara down.

‘Do you want to come home with me?’ She asked on our way to her car. I nodded. Diana drove us through the snowy night, quite a long drive away from campus. I hadn’t been in that part of town before, even when I still left my dorm to go to class. I followed her into her house, a much prettier building than the old cement block I grew up in. It looked like the ones in my old neighborhood, the ones I would’ve much rather lived in back then. She hung up her coat, told me to take off my shoes as she disappeared into the depths of her home. The outside looked traditional, much like all the other houses you’ll find here, but she had brought out its uniqueness with interior decoration. I found many different pairs of black high-heeled shoes by the door, pictures of herself and paintings on the wall. Whether she painted them or not, I have no idea. I walked down the neat corridor, taking in the family pictures. Many featured two girls, both with black hair, both dressed in the same oppressive floral dresses. Identical, safe for the fact that one was smiling. I wasn’t sure which one was Diana and which one was her sister. 

I found her in the dim kitchen, sleek and black like the dress she wore that night. She poured me a glass of red wine while asking if I drank. It didn’t look like she needed a reply. I took a big enough gulp to feel tipsy and she took a sip from her own glass.

‘Are you enjoying yourself so far?’ She asked with a hand on the collar of my shirt. 

‘I am.’

‘See? And you wanted to shoot me down.’

‘I didn’t want to shoot you down,’ I mumbled, leaning on the counter. ‘I just-’ I started, but Diana unbuttoning my shirt made me stumble over my own words. I took another quick gulp, and then another involuntary one as she tipped the glass up with her finger.

‘We can take this to the bedroom, if you want to. Or am I going too fast for you?’

‘No, no it’s fine. I mean,’ I quickly finished the rest of the wine, putting the glass down. My head was swimming, though I wasn’t sure if it was from the alcohol or her advances. ‘Yeah, we-... we can.’

She smiled, leading me through a small hallway and sitting me down on her bed, black like everything else. Diana stripped off her dress, and I felt awkward sitting there, still fully clothed. She helped my inhibitions, laying me down on my back and unbuttoning my jeans with care, as if not to startle me.

‘What’s that?’ I motioned to a thick keloid scar between her breasts, running down until the end of her ribs. I shouldn’t have asked, but the wine had done the damage. My mouth spoke faster than my brain could think.  
  
‘Just surgery.’

I didn’t get to ask further. She leaned down, stroking her thumb over my lips before she kissed me. I don’t know why I was surprised, but I let out a gasp at that.”

“I think it’s normal for your first time.” 

“Yeah?” Alexander smiled. “That’s good to hear. I felt stupid then. Not sure how to move my tongue with hers. Her hands were slowly undressing my shirt and I made her stop. I usually forget what my body looks like. I draw a blank when I think about it. At some point I accepted that this would be my body for the foreseeable future, maybe forever. It’s not worth getting hung up on it. So it’s not there, for all I know. But others don’t have that disconnect, they see me completely. I suddenly remembered it and killed the mood, even though Diana knew what she’d find. And she reminded me.

‘It’s okay, Alexander.’ She kissed me again, undoing the last button. Diana pulled back to look at my body as she pushed the fabric aside. ‘You’re perfect for me.’ Her cold hand lingered on the skin between my breasts before she straddled my waist and fiddled with her bra strap. I reached up to help her. Before long we were both naked and I felt someone inside me for the first time in my life. Sorry, is this too much information?”  
  
“No, it’s fine.” I assured him, motioning for him to continue. 

“That night I had a dream where I stood in the snow. I could feel it. It was exceptionally cold under my bare feet. My body swayed in the wind, but I felt unable to move on my own accord. As if the snow held me in place. I realized it was something else holding me as I felt something grab onto my ankles. Firm as it heaved itself up, using my body to pull itself upwards. Something hairy, with thick claws jabbing into my body, and I still couldn’t move. It built itself up in front of me, a figure that I can’t describe to you. I immediately forgot what I had seen when waking up, I just knew what happened. I remember the creature averting my gaze skywards as it pushed my head back, those claws wrenching my mouth open further than it should have been able to. And then it somehow jammed its long maw down my throat, as if trying to eat me from the inside. It was an impossible fit, but it still somehow found space inside, and I was forced to stand motionless and quiet. I was cold and aching until the creature pulled its maw back and my body was covered in the warm blood spilling from my severed tongue. 

I jolted awake, striking Diana with my knee and apologizing before realizing she was still sleeping deeply with her head on my chest. I told her the next day, and she seemed unfazed, suggesting I might’ve been a bit through the wind after last night.”  
  
“Did you come over often?”

“Oh, yeah. I basically lived there. She allowed me to stay and I slowly migrated over. My clothes were left rotting in my dorm, and I had no particular belongings worth bringing. It was weird to be alone in her home at first. I touched her things as if I was holding a newborn and I found specific spots for myself, not wanting to leave a trace anywhere else. I felt most comfortable in the bathroom, taking my first long baths, sometimes with Diana sitting by the tub, sometimes inside with me. She encouraged me to get comfortable, to treat what was hers as if it was my own. I tried to help out around the house, but I don’t really have many skills that come in handy. Most I did was cook mediocre meals, but she was always grateful for them.

‘Are you sure you don’t want to come to church?’ She asked once while we were laying next to each other, me shirtless, as she enjoyed it, and her covered by the blanket. Diana had this talent to bring up the church whenever I was most comfortable. I had heard her ask so often, I was almost getting annoyed, but I stayed polite. I assumed she was asking me to repent, or to at least try and secure a spot in heaven. Or maybe it was her way of bonding, getting me into her interests, though I wished she’d find a different one.

‘No, I’m good. I don’t think I belong there. I think only an exorcism could get me up there.’

‘Oh, no, none of that. I don’t think anyone really goes to heaven. You tell a lie and you’re on thin ice.’ She laughed. ‘You lied when I asked if I could come in, no?’ Though I shifted uncomfortably, she didn’t seem to take offense. ‘I could tell. You already sinned back then. And I can’t imagine you’re very God-fearing otherwise.’

‘I’m not.’

‘I like the church,’ She said with a sigh. ‘You know, it’s what I grew up with. I have my community there. The people are lovely. But the rules? The fear, the uppity authority? I can’t stand it. I prefer to go my own way.’

‘What is your way?’

For the first time since I met her, Diana paused before answering. ‘I talk to them regularly.’ She pointed up. ‘I told them how it pained me to blindly follow along with everyone, how I loved them, but didn’t think this way was right for me. They love me, they want what’s best for me. We came to an agreement. They gave me the freedom to live how I want, under my rules, if I could prove my love to them with one - just one - definitive gesture. It’s up to me what that is.’”

“She talked to God?”

“That’s what she told me.”

“Did you believe her?”

“I don’t know. Not really, but for all it’s worth she was convincing. I believe *she* believed that she talked to God.”

“And what was that… *‘gesture’* she talked about?”

“I asked her that.

‘I think confiding my biggest love in them and asking for their blessing would be grand enough.’ She said, ‘Introducing the one I love to them as if they were my parents. And I’d do that when I’m ready to stay with them forever. Me and my love and them in a perfect paradise. Not heaven, something specifically made for us.’ She looked at me. I wagged a finger between us, pointing at her, then myself. She nodded. ‘Yes, with you. With my love.’

‘Forever?’

‘We would become one.’ She continued, her tone lowering. She spoke slowly, enunciating each word. ‘To make sure we arrive there together. We’d need to put in equal effort. We need to be as close as possible.’ 

I let the idea swirl around in my head, unable to grasp how she meant it. I imagined something like marriage, a couple of heartfelt vows, just deeper in meaning than ‘*til death do us part*’, or maybe a blood pact even. 

‘...metaphorically?’

She shook her head, smiling gently. ‘I mean it. No metaphors.’ She took my chin between her fingers and made me look at her. ‘I’m talking about death, Alexander. I want to lay my body into yours, inside, so we can go together.’ My heart skipped a beat and I must’ve looked at her with so much shock that she backtracked. ‘Sorry, I thought you… I know that’s a lot. You’re the first person I’ve ever told, but I understand if it’s too much to-’

‘No, no, it’s not.’ I propped myself up. ‘It’s not, it’s not too much.’

My heart was racing, my tail was wagging. The mention of death left me dizzy and delirious like when I drank her wine. The new realization felt just like looking at my grandma in the open casket. It wasn’t news to me that I wanted to die, but Diana serving me the opportunity on a silver platter made me realize how badly I was wishing for someone to do it for me. Her eyebrows arched in bewilderment.”

Alexander’s hands were shaking, fingers intertwining to stop them, but instead the shaking migrated to another part of his body. He didn’t look at me, just continued to talk.

“‘I didn’t expect you to be *so* eager. Are you sure?’ I nodded before she even finished her question. Diana snapped her fingers in front of my face to get my attention. ‘I need you to be sure. If we were to go through with this, I can’t have you second-guessing.’

‘I won’t, I’m sure. You don’t even know how sure I am. I haven’t been more sure of anything ever.’ And to underline my point, I told her everything I have told you. Everything. I sometimes wonder if I wasn’t too pushy in the coming days.” Alexander looked up at me, mouth twitching as if he wanted to continue speaking, but fell silent. We sat like that for a moment. “Sorry, can we stop for today?”

“Oh- of course, yes.” I reached for my phone and paused the recording.. “We have enough time, I booked my stay here for a few more days.” He slumped back in his bed, letting out a shaky breath. “You’re doing great so far,” I offered. “but I get it if you need a break. It’s a lot to talk about.”

He just nodded at my words

Despite my tiredness, I forced myself to go out into town. I had no real destination, just wanting to get out of the house and let my mind work through what I knew so far. It was a long way until I saw the next houses, enough time to think about Alexander’s story and the revelation that the incident might have been more consensual than I had first assumed. I wracked my brain for cases with a similar relationship between perpetrator and victim, but couldn’t think of much except that one case of consensual cannibalism in Germany. Alexander’s desire didn’t seem to be out of lust, though, as far as he told me. I strolled through the city until the sun set, buying a late snack at a gas station before making my way back home. I passed the church which I found in the same state as yesterday. The shards were there, and from this angle I could see the damage on the wooden doors that didn’t stem from age. The wood was splintered and the copper door handles were bent out of place. 

Just as I got on the street where the bed and breakfast was, I caught my foot on something I hadn’t seen in the dark. When it looked up at me, I recognized the lump of fur as a black car laying on the ground.

“Oh no, I’m sorry. I didn’t see you there.” It hadn’t even stirred when I stumbled over it. I reached down to pet it and it purred when I scratched its chin. “You’re comfy in the snow, yeah?” I spent longer than I otherwise would’ve in the cold before I said my goodbyes to the cat. When I arrived at the bed and breakfast and was about to open the door, a soft mewl came from under me. The cat had followed me, rubbing against my leg with its tail wrapped around it. I couldn’t help but feel delighted by my new friend, but I had to let it down. “Kitty, you can’t come in with me. I don’t know if the owners would like that, okay? Go home, I bet your family is missing you.”

It didn’t have a collar, but I knew imagining it was a stray cat out in the harsh cold night would lead me straight to adopting it. “Here,” I pulled out the sandwich I got from the gas station and peeled a piece of meat off to throw into the snow. I had to leave it with at least a small parting gift, even if it meant it may come back the next day. I wouldn’t mind that. The cat didn’t even look at the meat, didn’t sniff it or even flinch. It just sat, looking at me. I tried to get it to notice the snack, but all it did was stare at me. “Ugh, okay. Not hungry, I guess?” I picked the meat back up, begrudgingly, and wrapped it in a napkin. Opening the door just wide enough to slip in in case the cat tried to squeeze its way inside with me, I entered.

I didn’t spend long talking with the daughter, briefly telling her about visiting family in the hospital before mentioning I was tired. It wasn’t a lie. I was ready to pass out. Maybe the sleep deprivation would help this time. I skipped my extensive nightly routine and broke it down to only the most necessary parts. When I left the bathroom and returned to my room, I was greeted by the black cat. It was sitting on the window sill, the window closed like it had been when I had left. “How’d you get in here?” I asked, stroking its head while I checked the window. I closed and opened it, then I closed and opened it again, and tried to open it while closed. It didn’t budge, not even when I yanked hard on it. Maybe it had snuck in with me and neither I nor the family had noticed. Whatever it was, I didn’t have the heart to usher it back outside. “Alright… you can stay one night.” I huffed.

With the lights turned off and a guided meditation whispering in my ear, I tried to fall asleep. The cat had found a comfortable spot on my chest, the weight and warmth having a nice, calming effect. It allowed my body to feel heavy and I drifted off slowly. The meditation registered only in segments, some parts lost when I had managed to pass out. The mattress under me was dissolving, fading inch by inch before I was floating. Then, I was falling. The sensation made my stomach twist and as I opened my eyes to wake from the dream, I realized I was staring at a dark night’s sky. My body hit the pavement with a force that felt so real it knocked the wind out of my lungs. I was outside, in the middle of town square with my head hit open on the ground, gasping for air but only being able to inhale. 

There was a weight on my body, tons that crushed my ribcage and pinned me to the ground. I couldn’t scream, the heavy snowflakes filled my mouth and throat and made me choke. All the while the mass on my body moved, the weight shifting and crushing my body over and over again, and as my eyes desperately sought for an escape, I saw two long clawed hands reach up. They were reaching for my eyes, traced my face with the sharpness of blades tearing through fabric and went towards my neck where I felt my windpipe close for good. I tried to scream, but no sound came, and when I swallowed and choked on the mass of snow in my mouth, I woke up coughing. 

I must’ve swallowed my spit the wrong way. While coughing, trying to regain my normal breathing, I noticed the cat still on my chest. In a big stretch, its paws were right in front of my face, splayed and showing off its needle-like claws. It curled back up and went to sleep. 

“Fuck…” I muttered to myself, rubbing the sleep from my eyes. I wasn’t going to sleep tonight.

1q4y3qh,https://www.reddit.com/r/ControversialOpinions/comments/1q4y3qh/homeless_people_are_not_your_problem/,Homeless people are not your problem.,"I understand there are homeless people who are in that position due to unfortunate circumstances, but they are doing their absolute best to get back on their feet. Those who are living out of their car, showering at a gym, using coffee shops for WiFi, etc. This post is not about them. 

This post is about the absolute waste of spaces that you walk by every morning on your way to school or work. You know, that one homeless guy who smells like a 4-day old bag of piss. Or that tweaker that picks fights with recycling bins. I have no empathy for these people, because they’ve made their choice, and they don’t want to get better. *I DO NOT CARE IF THEY ARE ADDICTED TO DRUGS, THAT IS WHAT REHAB AND SUPPORT GROUPS ARE FOR. IF YOU FAIL REHAB OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN, IT IS YOUR FAULT, NOT SOCIETY’S. IF YOUR FAMILY TRIES TO SUPPORT YOU AND YOU FUCK UP, IT IS ALWAYS YOUR FAULT.*

The one thing I cannot stand is when somebody who is very clearly homeless, on drugs, and doesn’t take care of themselves, puts the burden on the functioning members of society to take care of them. They get upset with people who don’t have change for them. They get aggressive when you tell them you’ll give them food instead of money. They try to manipulate you with some bullshit sob story of how they can’t eat because their family kicked them out. 

At some point, we as a society have to understand that there is no hope for certain people. You try to help them, try to feed them, bath them, clothe them, give them a hot shower, a place to sleep, and offer your full-fledged support over and over and over again, only for them to relapse and fall back into their ways. There is no helping someone who doesn’t want the help. I’m not proposing any violence against these people; I am saying that we should leave them be and let them revel in the lifestyle they’ve chosen for themselves.

I’m a  F22 y.o, my partner is a M 26 y.o. We’ve been together for a year. I want to tell my story and hear some advice, because I’m already breaking and I want to leave this relationship, but I was bullied and manipulated so much that I feel like a rag and not capable to make the final step.

We met a year ago on a dating app. At first everything seemed kinda okay, but there were things that already worried me. For example: when we went on a short trip outside the city for a couple of days, I thought we were already in a relationship, but he joked that I’m a “free girl”, then said he was joking. I would never go on a trip with someone if I didn’t think we were in a relationship. Already then, when I was crying because of his words, he just turned around and fell asleep. Later, when I tried to wake him up and talk, he turned to me and said that I was ruining his vacation. And the whole evening he kept reminding me that I cried and ruined his night.

Already then I should have left him, but I didn’t. I thought to myself that a person can’t be THAT toxic, there must be something good in him. That with time it will show, he just doesn’t know me well enough yet.

Later there were situations when I wanted to say something, to express that I didn’t like something, he said “if something’s wrong, the door is there”. I don’t know why I didn’t walk out through that door

Then there were sudden moves. I didn’t understand what was going on, he didn’t explain anything and was very secretive. To every question he answered “why the f\*ck do you care?”. He never returned to the place where he lived before

I broke up with him twice, but he apologized, said he was wrong and that everything would change. I believed him. I kept coming to him, but I constantly wanted to cry next to him, and I kept all my tears inside, because when I cried he called me weak and an actress

He was mentally draining me, constantly saying “well at least you’re pretty”. For every small mistake there was an extreme negative reaction. And I started making even more mistakes, because I was under constant stress. Because of this I developed apathy towards life, I fell into depression and I didn’t want to live.

He constantly said he had no money. I never complained about it. And after saying he had no money - he bought himself branded things. He wanted me to move in with him, but then we would live 50/50, and he said he didn’t care where I would work. At the same time, he’s not a man who works Monday to Friday and earns \~$5000. This is a person who brags about his achievements, about how much real estate he has, about business ideas and so on. This is a person who can easily buy his mom everything she wants. (And when I said that I will never be as important to him as his mom he said that’s true.) So my 50% would actually be like 2% of his income. At some point he said I could pay less, but then I would fully take care of the house and of course obey him.

He constantly says that if I listened to him, I wouldn’t create problems.

For my birthday, having the ability, he gifted me a thing in a color I never wear, and from a brand I’ve hated for 6 years. And we’ve been together for a year, he never bothered to know that. He bought a useless thing. And I understand that for him \~$150 is literally nothing. If he didn’t want to spend money, he could’ve just gifted perfume. I’m obsessed with perfumes. I didn’t show anything. But it hurt, because for his birthday I wanted to gift something way more expensive, and I was saving money specially for that.

A few weeks later, he gave his $10k watch to his friend’s kid, because “he likes seeing other people happy and it brings him pleasure”. As I understood, seeing his own woman happy doesn’t bring him pleasure. It hurt that he does more for strangers than for the woman next to him.

He said that if I had any serious problems, he wouldn’t be around. And it’s not only about illnesses, although I doubt even that. He constantly says that he won’t give me anything in this life, even if he could and I honestly don’t ask for anything. And he constantly says that it’s great that I don’t ask.

Every time he talks on the phone, he leaves the room. There were situations when I had to leave the house because someone was coming to see him for a short time.

He constantly said that he feeds me. When I answered that I went to buy groceries, carried them home, cooked and cleaned, he said “yeah but who gave you the money for that?”

And this is not even everything. I learned to just put all the pain aside in the moment and forget it. I literally developed fear of him. I learned to do everything “right”, not talk too much because I faced a lot of aggression. I’m really scared to say this, but I became a rag. And damn, I’m not ugly, I’m not stupid, although I already started doubting that, because if I was smart I wouldn’t start dating him. I’m definitely not poor, even though the last year was hard for me. But I was manipulated so much during this time, and I allowed it, that I no longer understand what’s right and what’s not.

At some point we had a huge fight because he was moving again. My relatives came to pick me up because I couldn’t stay in the same house with him. They were very angry and kept saying it. I constantly heard how I, from the person I was, could turn into such a rag. That I was never like this before. And I see it myself.

After that, he sent me a huge message, apologized, said he talked nonsense and doesn’t really think that way. He asked to meet and talk. I agreed. Then I went on vacation to another country.

I used to post photos on my private Instagram from travels. People often wrote that they like how joyful I am, how I share interesting moments. And!!!!! I wasn’t talking to any men. But he freaked out and said he doesn’t like “seeking attention”. And I stopped posting. He didn’t even say it nicely. I said that I don’t hide him and would like to post a photo with him, but I don’t know how he’d react. He said he doesn’t want even a part of his body on social media. He doesn’t post himself. We have very few photos together and he said that’s good and he doesn’t want photos.

I talked to his friends and parents on video, but never met his parents in real life. I once opened up about something in my family, for the first time in my life, and he said that person is “f\*cked up, worthless”. It was very painful, I asked him not to talk like that because I love this person. He said we just call things by their names.

Recently he told me that he doesn’t understand why I’m with him, because he’s not the most handsome, he controls me, demands a lot, has a bad character and I’m still with him. From that moment I started thinking. But it wasn’t the final stop yet.

After that I went with him to another country, now we live with his friends. And I see how his friend treats his girlfriend and it hurts. It hurts seeing how things can be different. When we moved in and I said it’s bad there are no shelves, he said that if I don’t like something, he can take me to the airport. When his friend’s girlfriend complained about their choice he reacted normally. Same with everything: when my boyfriend is busy I can’t enter his space, when his friend is busy his girlfriend can.

For three days he’s reminding me that he gave me his car and I slightly scratched it somewhere, because I’ve had my license only for several months. And that for this I should basically sit and shut up. I wake up every day thinking this is toxic and with emptiness inside.

Today I woke up again and he started again about how I washed his clothes wrong, put higher temperature but I didn’t. I did it like always.

He constantly tells me “why the f\*ck do I need a woman who creates problems”. And for him a problem is literally everything. Even that I threw trash into an empty coffee cup during a long drive and he almost drank from it. He started yelling that I shouldn’t put trash into empty cups so he doesn’t get confused.

Even a keychain from his dead relative, he yelled that I probably put it in some bag while cleaning and he threw it away. That it’s my fault, that I always do everything carelessly. Then, two weeks later, he found it in his own bag. And just said “you’re lucky I found it”. No apology. Nothing

I wish this story was fake. I admit that I lost. I thought I could change him, that my love would change everything, because he said he probably never met such a cool girl like me. But by actions I see the opposite.

Recently I told my brother about him. My brother called me and said I need to choose a normal person for life, that I’m a good and beautiful girl who deserves more. I was shocked how he hit exactly the point, because no one, even me, told him what was happening in this relationship. My brother is usually very reserved, but here he was sincere. Probably also because before, in my previous relationship, I wasn’t restricted, I constantly got flowers, I posted them. I was always happy. And now I stopped all of that and distanced myself from everyone. In one year I got flowers once. Before, my partner knew I’m obsessed with flowers and how happy they make me and I got them every month. And my brother noticed that. He asked why I stopped posting and became not myself.

Recently we were lying in bed, I was watching YouTube with headphones. The video ended and I was looking for a new one, so there was no sound. Then I heard a familiar song from his phone and I sang along. He asked why I was listening. I said the video ended and I heard the song. I joked that I can listen because he has no secrets from me. He answered “and who are you?”. I said  “woman”. He answered “exactly”. That “who are you?” sounded extremely careless. I truly understood that I’m nobody to him.

One of the last things: he freaked out because I entered the kitchen when he was “busy”. And the last thing he said: “you’ll eat and drink now, and don’t come in until I allow you”. Am I some f\*cking dog to ask permission to exist?

There are a few days left until my flight. Honestly, I want to start a new life. I understand I lost myself, I’m wasting my precious time and I’m not getting younger. Nothing will change. But this step is really scary for me. I was marinated in this for so long that even stepping aside feels terrifying.

I also understand that if I block him everywhere, he’ll write from another number like before. And I’m afraid he’ll say horrible things to me. I don’t like hurting people, but he deserves disappearing and a full block. That’s why I’m here. I really want to hear other people, especially those who were in similar situations and can understand me. I know there will be a lot of negative comments, and I can’t deny that some of them will be painful truth. I really stopped respecting myself. I became a rag.

Sorry if this is messy. I’m in some kind of fog. Like real abusers, my partner sometimes behaves very nicely, and then I get hope that everything will change. But this “little bit of good” is not enough to cover all the bad. I really want to be loved, not turned into “nobody”. I go to therapy and honestly don’t understand how I allowed myself to be dragged into this. For a whole year my boundaries were crossed little by little. It reminds me of a frog: if you throw it into boiling water, it will try to escape, but if you heat the water slowly,it won’t even notice it’s being boiled.

For myself I made a decision.

I’m trying to understand why I’m still chronically tired and would appreciate outside perspective.

For context, I’m in my early 20s. For the past 3–4 years, I’ve averaged around ~500 mg of caffeine per day (coffee + energy drinks). I’ve also taken 5 mg melatonin nightly for several years. For the last ~2 years, I’ve been prescribed Adderall, which I take intermittently (not daily).

Despite this, I:
	•	Sleep 8–9 hours every night
	•	Exercise 4–5x/week
	•	Eat reasonably well
	•	Recently started enforcing a consistent 10pm–7am sleep schedule

Even with all of that, I still feel unrefreshed most mornings, need caffeine/stimulants to function, and never feel truly “awake.” It’s not depression — more like constant low energy and heavy sleep inertia.

I’ve had basic bloodwork done (CBC, CMP, testosterone, TSH/T4), which all came back normal.

My questions:
	•	Can long-term high caffeine + nightly melatonin use actually worsen sleep quality over time?
	•	Is it possible to be getting enough sleep but poor restorative sleep?
	•	Has anyone reversed something like this by tapering caffeine/melatonin or fixing circadian rhythm issues?
	•	Would a sleep study or cortisol testing be worth pursuing?

I’m open to tough answers — just trying to figure out what I’m missing.

I’ve been drinking pour over coffee at home for the last 10 years and recently finally decided to upgrade to espresso.

I’ve been trying to dial in my Breville Bambino with the Chestnut for the last month, but I can’t get proper flow or crema. I don’t usually drink espresso on its own and mostly make lattes, so it doesn’t taste bad, and with fresh beans it’s actually relatively good.

I know a proper burr grinder would improve my experience, but I currently don’t have the resources to upgrade, so I’m trying to make this setup work.

I’m making single shots using the single-wall one-shot basket so I can have a couple of cups a day and use fewer beans while practicing and experimenting with grind size, dose, etc. I buy good local beans, usually light-medium or medium roast.

Timemore recommends 7–8 clicks for espresso on the C3S. I’ve tried 8 and it doesn’t look good. Usually 9 gives the best (possible) results, while 10 is already too coarse. I’ve tried doses of 8, 9, 10, and 11 grams, but changing the amount doesn’t really help, neither at 8 nor 9 clicks.

I’ve been timing the shots and the numbers seem right, but the coffee always looks watery and lacks crema.

I was wondering if anyone has successfully dialed in espresso with a hand grinder and has any tips. 

…or if I should just use the pressurized basket until I can upgrade to a proper burr grinder.

1q4xrjj,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1q4xrjj/the_reason_your_chatgpt_outputs_sound_like_ai/,The reason your ChatGPT outputs sound like AI,"I write a lot of content using ChatGPT. Marketing copy, emails, blog posts, social stuff. And for months I had this problem where everything came out sounding... AI-ish. You know the tone. Slightly formal, weirdly optimistic, uses phrases like ""delve into"" and ""tapestry"" and ""in today's fast-paced world.""

I'd spend half my time editing out the AI voice, which defeated the whole purpose.

Then I figured out what was actually causing it, and it wasn't what I expected.

Most people think the AI voice comes from the model itself. Like ChatGPT just naturally writes that way. So they try to fix it by saying ""write more casually"" or ""be more human"" or ""don't sound like AI."" Doesn't work. You still get that weird overly-polished corporate voice.

The actual problem is that when you don't give ChatGPT enough constraints, it gravitates toward the statistical center of its training data. And the statistical center of ""professional content on the internet"" is... pretty bland. Corporate blog posts, generic marketing copy, formal articles. Lots of volume, not much personality.

So when you write a vague prompt, ChatGPT gives you the average of everything it's seen. Which sounds like AI because it's the most common version of that content type.

Here's what actually fixed it for me. Instead of telling ChatGPT what not to do, I started listing specific phrases and patterns to avoid. Not general instructions like ""don't be formal"" but actual words and structures.

Like if I'm writing marketing copy, my prompt includes: ""Don't use: 'delve into,' 'tapestry,' 'landscape,' 'robust,' 'leverage,' 'seamless,' 'game-changing,' 'innovative,' 'unlock,' 'empower,' 'transform.' No sentences that start with 'In today's' or 'In the world of.' No rhetorical questions. No exclamation points.""

That alone cuts out like 80% of the AI voice.

But the part that really makes it sound human is adding friction and imperfection on purpose. Real human writing isn't perfectly structured. We use incomplete thoughts sometimes, we contradict ourselves, we have asides and tangents, we vary sentence length in ways that don't follow rules.

So now I include stuff like: ""Vary sentence length dramatically. Include some very short sentences for emphasis. Use fragments occasionally. Add conversational asides in parentheses. Start some sentences with 'And' or 'But' or 'So.' Write like you're explaining this to someone over coffee, not presenting to a board room.""

The combination of those two things, banned phrases plus intentional imperfection, completely changed the output quality. It went from ""this is obviously AI"" to ""I need to read this twice to be sure.""

There's another layer too. ChatGPT defaults to explaining everything, even when explanation isn't needed. It's trained on educational content and documentation, so it over-explains. Real human writing assumes the reader can infer things.

So I started adding: ""Don't explain obvious things. Don't define terms the audience already knows. Skip setup and get to the point. Assume the reader is smart.""

That cuts out a lot of the hand-holding tone that screams AI.

The thing nobody tells you is that getting good outputs isn't about finding the right model or the right prompt template. It's about understanding what ChatGPT defaults to when you're vague, and explicitly steering it away from those defaults.

Most ""AI detection"" isn't detecting AI. It's detecting patterns that indicate you didn't constrain the output enough. Default phrasing, perfect structure, over-explanation, lack of personality. Those are all symptoms of under-constrained prompts.

Once I started thinking about prompts as ""how do I prevent ChatGPT from falling back to statistical averages,"" the outputs got way more usable. I'm not trying to coax personality out of it, I'm blocking the generic patterns that emerge when I'm not specific enough.

This applies to everything, not just writing. Code, analysis, planning, whatever. When your output feels generic, it's usually because your prompt wasn't constrained enough and ChatGPT defaulted to the most common version of that thing.

The fix is always the same. Be more specific about what you don't want, add intentional imperfection where appropriate, and block the obvious patterns that mark something as AI-generated.

Anyway, if you want some actual prompt examples that use this structure, I put together 5 professional ones you can copy-paste, let me know if you want them.",6,1767646461.0,ChatGPT,9,0.75,False

So it's been less than a week. I have lean PCOS and have suffered my entire life with so many challenging symptoms - cystic acne, hirsutism, belly fat, infertility. Thanks to modern medicine, I was able to have two babies. But in more recent years I have started to notice dark rings forming around my neck and dark spots on my back. My so called ""glucose levels"" keep coming back normal, but I know inside me something is wrong and the red flags keep coming, and I've been in denial that sugar was the main culprit. I have a history of diabetes on both sides of my family. And my husband's parents are prediabetic too, so my kids are also at risk. 

I'm finally motivated to cut sugar out of my life, starting with a sugarfree cleanse in January and then potentially setting some kind of limit (e.g. once per month) for when and what I can have. For as long as I can remember, I have been having a sugary coffee drink (or two!) every single day. In the afternoon I would have something sweet like dark chocolate. And more evenings than not, I indulge in some sort of dessert. Generally I've been good about cutting added sugars out of my breakfasts/lunches/dinners so at least that won't be a big lifestyle shift. And I'm generally ok about not overdoing it on refined carbs though there's certainly room for improvement

But I'm really hoping that by cutting out sugar, it will help heal some of the symptoms I've been battling for my entire teenage and adult life. And additionally, I hope that by not having it around the house, it will set my kids up for a healthy foundation and healthy relationship with sugar so that it is truly just a once in awhile treat for birthday parties or vacations and not a daily or weekly indulgence. 

Would love to hear from any other women who also have PCOS who saw a significant difference in their symptoms by going sugar-free. ",3,1767646444.0,sugarfree,0,1.0,False

1q4xq7j,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1q4xq7j/the_waffle_house_at_the_edge_of_the_woods/,The Waffle House at the edge of the Woods,"Waffle House, an icon of American midwestern and southern culture. Often, it’s yellow glow is a beacon of hope to those late night dwellers, whether they be members of the working class or alcohol favoring partiers. Druggos are also a staple clientele. Waffle House, for better or worse, opens its doors to everyone from every walk of life. 

I will set the scene: it’s a late Thursday night, or early Friday morning in technicality, and I was heading home from a late night bender where I had the important but ultimately boring job of designated driver. All I wanted to do was go home and crack open a cold one for myself to kick off my weekend. Nature had other plans, however. The weather in the midsouth turned on a dime, and tonight was no exception. A downpour diminished any visibility on the road, and I knew I couldn’t confidently drive through this. The familiar yellow glow shone through the onslaught of rain and hail, however, and given that Waffle House will probably remain open under threat of nuclear war, I knew I could seek refuge there. 

The jingling bells welcomed me more than any employee did, but I could not blame them. The restaurant was a mess, probably from a busy evening earlier. The rodeo was this weekend, after all, and those rodeo boys sure loved their Waffle House. Shit, we all did. It was a Waffle Home in this part of town-- it was all we had after the rest of the town went to bed at sundown. 

A waitress sighs and tells me to sit wherever I’d like and she’d get to me when she could. She looked so tired. I picked the one somewhat clean table in the place, and watched the storm rage on outside. My phone confirmed that I would be here for awhile, and all I could do at this point was hope it didn’t evolve into a tornado. Waffle House would probably remain open even if it did. 

Even this late into the night, Waffle House had a buzz of conversation and kitchen noises. I saw a full staff and other customers, and yet, the only sound in the place was the hail beating on the roof and windows. The usual late night sound of laughter or arguments (usually the latter) was replaced by this frighteningly eerie silence. 

Seeing my phone was nearing the end of its battery life, I glanced around for an outlet when my eyes met those of the man in the booth across me. His hunched shoulders were cloaked in a dirty plaid shirt, and I assumed he might have been one of the rodeo boys. He wasn’t terribly old, maybe in his fifties at most, but the weariness of his features aged him. He stared at me momentarily, a slight crustiness to his gaze, before he returned to his plate of syrup soaked waffles. 

I slid down a little in my booth, knowing I’d soon be phoneless. Well, not the end of the world, I figured. People operated just fine without phones for years. I set it aside and waited for my waitress to remember I was here. 

The lights above flickered, and yet were silent-- none of that fluorescent hum. Or maybe there was, and I just couldn’t hear it among the thunder and hail. It still struck me as unsettling, but my thoughts were interrupted by the work worn face of Marilyn. 

“What can I get you?,” she asked in a monotone voice that added to my increasing unease. She didn’t sound tired, or annoyed, she sounded utterly blank. Almost robotic, but with an inflection of human that made it uncanny.

“Could I get a coffee, and the two egg breakfast with--”  I didn’t get to specify anything about my plate before she was walking away. Must have been a hell of a shift, I thought to myself. Whatever, food was food, I would be fine with whatever I got at this point, as long as it passed the time faster. I just wanted to go home. 

Her shoes echoed as she shuffled off, and she didn’t speak with the cook, she just handed him a plate with random crap on it. Figuring my staring would be rude, I turned back to the window. Luckily, the hail stopped, but the rain was still coming down in buckets. No tornado watch yet. The atmosphere felt oppressively thick, and I almost felt like I was choking on the smells of burnt coffee, bacon, and stale cigarettes. There was an undertone to it though, something I couldn’t place right away. It was oddly….metallic. 

I pressed the heels of my hand to my eyes and took a deep breath. I had to relax. It was just a fucking Waffle House. It was always weird-- that was part of the charm. My growing anxiety was just the storms, right? 

“Good time for a late night meal, huh?” The voice made me jump from my seat. It was the rodeo guy, staring right at me. His voice was low and gravelly and much more human than the waitress’s, yet it gave me even more anxiety. Despite how I’d seen him actively eating, his plate had the same amount of food on it that I’d seen earlier. He had a little smirk on his face, and glanced at the window, as if suggesting I do the same. 

I smiled nervously, wondering why the fuck some random man was talking to me. I was a newer face around this part of the country, and what they called Southern Hospitality still creeped me the fuck out. As if noticing this, he let out a frightening little chuckle before returning to his plate of waffles, his weirdly hypnotic gaze now breaking. 

I looked back out the window, weirdly compelled to, and the rain had downgraded to less apocalyptic now. I could see my car, and a few bodies in the parking lot smoking. I had a bad habit of not locking my doors, so I locked them from my remote to deter any smokers out there who might be interested in my stunning little Nissan Altima that smoked if you drove it longer than twenty minutes. Lightning flashed, momentarily illuminating the parking lot. That’s when I noticed the shadows. They moved unnaturally, and danced only at the very edges of the parking lot.

My heart began to race, but like before, the waitress interrupted my growing unease. A cup of coffee was placed in front of me, its smell warm and familiar. And yet, it brought me no comfort. I tried to ask for sugar and cream, but again, the waitress walked away before I could. Black coffee was better than no coffee, I figured. Taking a sip eased my nerves a bit, and I told myself I was just letting my anxiety get out of hand. I was finding fright in things that were perfectly normal-- for a Waffle House. 

Aside myself and the rodeo boy, there was one other table here. Five people in total, who were silent the whole time. I only knew this because they stared at me as they walked by to leave. No words, no smiles, just vacant staring. I knew I stood out, but it made me feel uncomfortable regardless. 

Rodeo boy laughs once more. “Saw yer plates,” he said, motioning to the window. “Out of state. You’re new here, aren’t ya?”

“Been about six months,” I replied. Did that count as new? Ever since I moved here, people seemed obsessed with the idea of me being from out of town. It felt so unnecessary.

“That’s just a drop of piss in the bucket, son. I’m here every night, and I ain’t ever seen you.” He was right. I’d never been to this Waffle House before. I much more preferred the one on the highway, surrounded by other businesses. This one was more remote, which added to it’s uncomfortable atmosphere. “They’re gonna stare, son. You’re out here dressed as Count Dracula, chokin’ back black coffee. We don’t do cream ‘n sugar, you’ll just have to mature a bit.”

He laughed once more, but I decided not to reply. Why should I? He was a creepy, hulking man who was getting a kick out of scaring and insulting me. It felt safest to pretend he wasn’t there. 

My eyes go back to the window, and in another flash of lightning, I see them again. The shadows. It was as if fingers of darkness were clawing at the edges of the parking lot. I inched closer to the glass to get a better look, when the sound of a plate slamming once again pulls my attention away. My waitress. 

“Syrup?,” she asked. 

It confused me, until I looked down and saw waffles. I hadn’t ordered that. “Oh, this is--”

“All we got,” she snapped. “Syrup or not?”

I nervously shook my head and slumped in my seat some as she walked away. I wasn’t the biggest fan of waffles-- even Waffle House’s-- but hey, food was food. I took a bite, and again looked out the window. The sight made me nearly choke on my food. 

The man was laughing wholeheartedly now, as if my horror was the funniest thing he’d ever seen. The entire lot now was engulfed in the strange tendrils of shadow, and it was pulling at the hedges that perimetered the building. I got up quickly, getting as far from the window as I could in a short amount of time. 

My eyes looked to rodeo boy. “Shut the fuck up dude-- don’t you see that!?”

“See what?,” he mocked. “Oh, hush boy.” His laughing ceased and he pointed at the seat across his. “Your mind’s playing with ya, making ya see shit. Why don’t ya sit awhile and relax some?”

I shook my head and turned to the counter, trying to pay. But it was like the staff was ignoring me. 

“Ah, come on!,” the man teased. “You look like you’d be a big fan of the creepy crawlies that hang out ‘round here! C’mon, sit with me, I can tell ya all about it.”

I still didn’t want to, and every instinct said not to, and yet, it was like he was forcing me to. I was stiff as a corpse as I sat down, and my eyes refused to meet his. They were quite suddenly full of life, like a proud predator who had just caught his prey. 

“They say these woods are haunted,” he said.

“That’s cool…” I murmured, looking for any out to leave.

“The shadows yer seeing, they ain’t real. The trees pull weird tricks out here. No, no, see the real worries in this neck of the woods ain’t no ghosties. There’s weird people.”

No shit. I’m sitting with one.

He then says something that injected ice into my veins. “Yanno, you’d make a fine lookin’ corpse, Hollywood.”

There was an instinct to correct him, wanting to say that just because I was from California didn’t mean I was from Hollywood. I’d never even been to fucking Hollywood. But fear took over, and I tried to inch out of my seat.

“Not a lot of meat on ya, though. But I bet you’re one of them clean eaters, all that plant based shit. I bet that’s like a good, grass fed beef. Ya dig?”

I dug, alright. I once again tried to leave, but now, his hand had a frighteningly strong grip on my own. “I wouldn’t go out there right now if I was you. Like I said, they say these woods are haunted. They say they make people do crazy things. There’s a few families in them there woods, families I won’t ever speak to. They like to wait for the dark--” His voice immediately stopped with the tingling of bells. A new face had just walked in.

He was a tall, thin, utterly filthy man. I would guess that he was a farmer based on his clothing, but it was almost as if he was dressed in a costume to trick people like me who weren’t raised around here.

Rodeo boy in front of me now leaned in close. “That there’s one of em,” he whispered. “You sit tight, pretty boy.”

I had a chance to escape then, as he’d gotten up to greet this freak. But that meant walking right by them, which I didn’t want to chance. This new comer had dead eyes, the kind with no soul in them. I turned away, quietly listening to rodeo boy talk him up. 

“Well, shoot, Todd I ain’t seen ya in, shit, how long’s it been now?” Rodeo boy sounded genuinely friendly now. 

“Not since our Brodie went missin’,” Todd replied. His voice was oddly deep for someone as scrawny as he was. “It’s been ‘bout six months.”

Todd glances my way, and I again feel ice in my blood. “You looks a lot like my Brodie,” he said. “You wanna be Brodie?”

Rodeo boy, takes him by the shoulder and leads him to a table. “Now, Todd, that twig looks nothing like Brodie. You don’t want him.”

Want me? I got up now, knowing this may not end well. I tried to be inconspicuous as I went for the door, but Todd’s voice warned me not to. “You don’t wanna go out there right now. Mama’s out, ‘n she’s in one of her moods. She’s been real hungry, Mason. I dunno what to with her.”

Rodeo boy, aka Mason, told me to sit back down before turning back to Todd. “You gotta ride it out. Yer family can’t keep doin’ this.” His voice dropped to a hush. “One of these days, someone’s gonna catch on. Get her a deer or somethin’, all these missin’ boys is eventually gonna turn back to you.”

It was all clicking. Was this Mama some crazed murder? Was she blood thirsty? Or was it a more literal hunger? 

I didn’t want to stick around to find out. My car was less than twenty feet away. If I ran, I could get in it fast enough to beat it out of here. 

“I wouldn’t try it!,” Mason called after me. But it was too late. I was dining and dashing sure, but I had to get the fuck out of here. Through the rain, I sprinted to my car, and practically dove inside. I prayed for it to start on the first try, for once in my life, and thank god it did. I ensured all my doors were locked before turning on the headlights. 

The sight before me made me scream. An older, larger woman was in front of my car. In my panic, I was struggling to shift into reverse, giving her a chance to hobble to my door. Through the glass, I could hear her wailing, “You gotta light!? You gotta light for my cigarette!?” She was pounding on the window, begging for a light. 

I did not care. I threw the car into reverse and whipped the fuck out of there. I was going about ninety on the highway, wanting to put as much space between me and this Waffle House as possible. It was all a bad dream, I told myself, a manifestation of my anxiety. Seeing my apartment complex in my headlights felt like salvation, and I knew this was all behind me. Now, more than ever, I craved a Modelo. I took a moment in my car to just breathe. Everything was going to be alright, I assured myself. It was all fine. Mason was just scaring me for fun, Todd was obviously mentally ill, that woman was probably on drugs. It was just a weird night. I was letting my fear of storms make everything into a horror movie. 

Once I’d stopped shaking, I started for my apartment. Typically, I never paid attention to anything in the lobby, least of all the mess of papers that littered the billboard. There was usually all the same shit: local ads, lost pets, and missing people. The same things you’d see at a Walmart or a post office, or anywhere else. I’d seen it all so much that it melted into the background in my day to day life. 

But tonight, it caught my eye. A missing person’s flyer with a photo of a guy looking vaguely like myself. Brodie Wells, it read. Brodie. My heart sunk as I ripped it off and inspected it closer. Behind Brodie’s flyer was another, very similarly formatted. Another young guy, looking like an outsider. And another. And another. There were over twenty of them-- all within ten years of age from each other, all not dressing like the townsfolk I'd seen here, and all missing in this area. All last seen around that Waffle House by those woods. They were also all tourists, visitors-- just like myself. I brought all the flyers to my unit with me, laying them all over my floor to get a better look. This kidnapper definitely had a type. Or was it a kidnapper? 

I pulled open my laptop and started researching each name, and everything came back the same. No trace of any of them, and this had been going on for years. Two of them had an ounce more of information on them, as their names were better known. They had public profiles, so there was much more on their case. They were also tourists, but they looked different from the kidnappers' victim type. They were in town for some YouTube video project, and apparently, one recommended they film out the woods in the area after a dinner at Waffle House. For years, nothing ever came up about them, until a hiker’s dog came running out of the woods with a human bone. One that was so smooth, it was as if all flesh had been cooked away. Those were the article's exact words. Soon, another bone was found, and both were DNA matched to a pair of missing YouTubers named Hunter and Isaiah. But that was years ago, and they were never explicitly tied to other missing persons cases. Despite the differences, I found connections. Were these the first victims? Did they put up too much of a fight, perhaps? The one did look a little intimidating, like he didn't trust strangers. Maybe he'd fought back? My heart was pounding and my mind went back to Waffle House. 

Mama’s in one of her moods. What was the mood? Homicidal? Damn it, Mason, that’s not something to ride out! I decided to try and call the police, but my phone was dead at this point. Surely, there was a public phone in the lobby. I raced downstairs for it, but to my dismay, the line was dead. Had the storm taken it out? It had picked back up again, the thunder rattling the whole building as it sounded. The lights flickered before also going out, and now, it was pitch black. The only light came from the occasional flashes of lightning. 

That’s how I saw her, standing in that glass doorway. As shadows unnaturally danced about in the same way they did in that parking lot, I saw her silhouette and a glimpse of her face, but there was no mistaking it. It was the same woman, and my only saving grace was the door being locked from the inside. She was pounding on the glass once more, begging to be let in. 

“Come on, now, boy, you can spare a light!,” she begged, somehow yelling loud enough that I could hear her clearly through the glass. Her fist was pounding on it in a jarring display of strength, sending echoing booms through the quiet lobby. I couldn't see a thing in the dark to find where I was going, and I stood frozen in fear. I was hoping the lock would hold and that the rain soaking her would make her give up. 

A million things ran through my mind. Mason really was a freak, but he was trying to be nice, wasn't he? Was he trying to save me? He seemed to know, and yet, he seemed to have a soft spot for Todd. Was Todd an unwilling accomplice? Were Mason's comments nothing more than to get me to either leave sooner, or pay attention to him? It seemed Marilyn, my waitress, was trying to keep me distracted too. Did they not want me to look out the window? Was that how this Mama spotted me? I lived my life in near constant fear of everyone around me that I missed those who maybe had good intentions at heart. How I regretted that now. 

All at once her pounding stopped, and I thought for sure she was done. But she suddenly pressed her face to the glass, and a long flash of lightning illuminated her unholy grin. She's not human, I thought to myself. She couldn't be. 

“You'd make a lovely corpse!,” she yelled, and it sent chills through me. 

It wasn't just because of those harrowing words. It was because I could hear her much clearer now. The door was open, the glass shattered around her frail, twitching frame. Her skin hung on her like kudzu hangs on an abandoned home, and her teeth were unnaturally large and white as she grinned maniacally. I was frozen before the sound of shuffling glass against the bottom of her slippers pushed me into action. Her eyes shone like a predator’s, and I had to act to live. 

All I could do now was run.

I was born and raised outside the UK. I went to university down in England but I am now based in Edinburgh for postgraduate studies.

I have been struggling with romantic relationships my whole life. I have never been able to go on a single date with any women. I have female friends but none of them are more than group project team mates, society committee members, or part-time work colleagues. I used dating apps for about 1-2 years but have had exactly zero likes and a few matches that led to nowhere, so I no longer use them. I am quite shy so I rarely ask people out in real life (probably 5-10 times, ever), and every time when I had the courage to do so, I was rejected.

I have tried to 'put myself out there'. For example, I am/was involved in several university societies. I volunteer within and outside the university. I attend weekly interest classes. I joined some tennis classes on and off (mostly because of weather). I have met different people through these channels but very few are single, available women whom I am attracted to. I am not interested in parties or pubs. Instead, places that I am frequently at are university, library, coffee shops and perhaps supermarkets. Unfortunately, I take that none of them are really appropriate settings to ask people out or even express interest in.

Would really appreciate some romantic relationship advice. Thanks in advance!",2,1767646375.0,UKrelationshipadvice,2,1.0,False

Yes, I know that depending on surgery and pathology, Kadcyla could still be part of the plan. But I’m choosing not to think about that right now. From what I hear, if that does happen, it’s not as tough as TCHP. So for now, I’m letting myself feel the relief and excitement of being soooo close to wrapping up this part. 

So in celebration of that, here are some of the things I’m looking forward to:

1.	Hair. Any amount of it.
2.	My eyes not watering profusely all day, every day.
3.	No more weird eye flutters and spasms.
4.	My taste buds coming back.
5.	Related to #4. Being able to drink drip coffee again without it tasting weird.
6.	No more steroids.
7.	My puffy moon face depuffing and looking more like me again.
8.	Fewer trips to the bathroom. Fingers crossed for normal-ish poops again! 
9.	No more weird steroid cravings. 
10. And honestly, not having to feel like dog shit every 3 weeks. 

I’m sure I’ll think of more and add to this, but these are the big ones right now.

The +++ journey is long and exhausting, but we gotta celebrate the small wins. Getting to the final round of TCHP feels like a big one for me. What are you most looking forward to?",13,1767646110.0,breastcancer,6,0.94,False
1q4xlup,https://www.reddit.com/r/FATTravel/comments/1q4xlup/chancery_rosewood_v_claridges/,Chancery Rosewood v. Claridge’s,"I realized after my recent London trip that there are surprisingly few reviews that truly compare The Chancery Rosewood with London’s most established luxury hotels. Having just stayed at both the Chancery and Claridge’s on the same trip, it felt like the perfect opportunity to do so. u/sarahwlee played a big role in helping us decide to try the Chancery. After sending several clients there recently and consistently hearing strong feedback, she encouraged us to experience it firsthand and then we could contrast it with a London classic.

The Chancery Rosewood is a brand-new hotel set in the former US Embassy in Grosvenor Square, following years of renovation and a massive investment. From a hard-product perspective, it is in a different league from most London hotels, including Claridge’s. The attention to detail, the materials, and the art throughout the building are exceptional. We were upgraded to a Mews room (thanks to Sarah), and it was truly spectacular: floor-to-ceiling windows, tons of natural light all day, a balcony, and a sense of space that is extremely rare in London.

The hotel refers to all rooms as “suites”, which is not entirely accurate, but they are undeniably oversized rooms that feel like elegant studios. Everything feels refined and expensive in the best way: plush carpets, layered fabrics on walls and headboards, beautiful curtains, and high-end bathroom finishes with heated floors. The furniture feels turn-of-the-century modern and of very high quality. The same design language carries through the hallways and common areas. There is no overpowering signature scent; instead, the hotel smells like quality wood and materials, which feels understated and luxurious.

The wellness facilities are outstanding and clearly surpass those at Claridge’s. The pool is large and beautifully designed, the gym is spacious and brand new, and the spa area with sauna, steam room, cold plunge, and hot tub is excellent (even if the hot tub could have been hotter). If space, light, and wellness matter to you, the Chancery is hard to beat.

Food and drinks were solid overall but are nothing too exciting. Serra was very good, GSQ worked well for coffee and snacks, and Eagle Bar had good cocktails. That said, Claridge’s is still in a different category when it comes to F&B atmosphere and variety.

My biggest hesitation before booking the Chancery was service, particularly after reading several recent reviews from previous guests. When you are staying at what is arguably London’s most expensive hotel, expectations are naturally very high. My other concern was that, despite the spectacular renovation, the hotel might feel a bit generic or interchangeable with a luxury property in any major city. In practice, that concern did not materialize. While the style is contemporary, the hotel does have a clear sense of place and does not feel anonymous or soulless.

Initial communication with the hotel after booking, however, was disappointing, with slow concierge responses and the need for multiple follow-ups. After flagging this to u/sarahwlee, she worked her magic and the head concierge, Conor, reached out personally and took over. From that moment on, the experience changed completely.

Conor was outstanding: proactive, prompt, warm, and genuinely helpful. On-property service was very good overall, though not yet flawless. The hotel is still young and finding its footing. The doormen were excellent, front desk staff was strong, and concierge was efficient and friendly, especially Conor. There were minor gaps that stood out at this price point: some staff not acknowledging guests in hallways, slightly slow delivery of small requests, and occasional lack of coordination within the broader concierge team. Nothing severe, and all things that will likely be ironed out with time. We also met Michael, the GM, who was friendly and approachable. The service style is very Rosewood: warm, relaxed, and flexible, rather than formal or ceremonial.

The overall ambiance at the Chancery is quiet and very exclusive, but not lively. During our stay, the majority of guests were Middle Eastern, and most guests kept to themselves. Unfortunately, we witnessed a few uncomfortable moments of guests being openly rude to staff, which affected the atmosphere. As a result, the lobby and public spaces did not feel social or animated. This is where the contrast with Claridge’s becomes very clear.

Out of our four nights in London, we stayed three at the Chancery and moved to Claridge’s for the final night. When we mentioned this, the Chancery team offered to drive us to Claridge’s in the house car, even though it was only two blocks away. Conor was waiting for us to say goodbye and let us know he had already spoken with the Claridge’s head concierge to smooth our arrival. As part of the Chancery stay, there is no fixed check-in or check-out time, and airport transfers are included. Conor even offered to pick us up from Claridge’s the next day to take us to the airport. That level of care really stood out.

Claridge’s could not feel more different. From the moment you walk in, the hotel is alive. The lobby, bars, and restaurants are always buzzing, with a high-end international crowd. Guests engage with staff and with each other, creating a lively, elegant atmosphere that feels unmistakably London.

Claridge’s is as British as it gets. The art-deco interiors are beautiful, the lobby fireplace gives the space a cozy smell of wood, and the hotel exudes old-world charm. Everywhere you look there are reminders of history, with photos of royalty and celebrities who have stayed there over the years. You genuinely feel part of something iconic.

Rooms at Claridge’s, however, require managed expectations, especially if you are coming from the Chancery. Our first room, a Mayfair Contemporary room, was beautifully decorated in a modern art deco style, but it felt dark, somewhat cramped, and awkwardly laid out. A significant portion of the square footage was lost to a largely unusable entry corridor, storage was limited, and the bathroom was on the small side. The biggest disappointment was the “courtyard” view, which is really an internal shaft facing walls and windows with almost no natural light. After coming from the Chancery’s Mews room with its balcony and floor-to-ceiling windows, the contrast was stark.

To their credit, after we shared our feedback, Claridge’s offered to move us to a studio two categories higher at no additional charge, which was a meaningful improvement and likely helped by the fact that we had booked through Sarah. This room aligned much more with expectations: high ceilings, generous space, excellent storage, a large bathroom plus a separate powder room, and a proper street view with natural light. Even so, Claridge’s rooms ultimately prioritize character and heritage over sheer space or contemporary luxury, especially when compared side by side with the Chancery.

Service at Claridge’s is excellent, but noticeably more formal and intuitive. Where the Chancery’s service feels warm, relaxed, and genuinely friendly, it can at times be less instinctive and still a bit uneven, which is understandable for a hotel that is finding its rhythm. At Claridge’s, service feels almost automatic: polished, discreet, and highly efficient, with staff anticipating needs before you articulate them and resolving things quietly in the background. There is a sense of confidence and ease that comes from repetition and tradition. This is a hotel that has had well over a hundred years to refine its service culture, and it shows in the consistency and precision of the experience.

Food and beverage is where Claridge’s most clearly and decisively outperforms the Chancery. Every dining and bar venue at Claridge’s has a distinct personality and sense of place, with far more character than the Chancery’s otherwise solid but more understated offerings. Afternoon tea is elegant and memorable, the Claridge’s restaurant is excellent for breakfast in a classic art-deco setting, Claridge’s Bar is a true institution, and Fumoir offers a darker, moodier alternative with real atmosphere.

As a guest at a Maybourne hotel, you also benefit from priority access across the group’s other properties, with the added convenience of charging everything back to your room. This made a meaningful difference during our stay. We were able to secure a prime-time table at the Connaught Bar, home to my favorite martini in the world, return later for a nightcap, and still be recognized by the staff. That level of access, continuity, and character across venues is something Claridge’s does exceptionally well and is an area where it clearly stands apart from the Chancery.

In the end, this is less about deciding which hotel is “better” and more about understanding which experience and overall vibe you are looking for. If you value space, light and contemporary design, the Chancery Rosewood is exceptional and arguably unlike anything else currently available in London. Its hard product is already among the strongest in the city, and once the hotel fully refines its service culture and settles confidently into its own identity, I have no doubt it will be ranked among the very top hotels in the world, just as it was recently recognized as the best new luxury hotel globally. The atmosphere there is quiet, discreet, and very exclusive, leaning more toward a private, modern sanctuary than a social hub.

If, on the other hand, you are drawn to history, energy, iconic bars, and a lively, social atmosphere, Claridge’s remains unmatched. It offers a vibrant yet elegant vibe, where guests interact, bars and restaurants buzz from morning to night, and you genuinely feel part of London’s living heritage. That sense of energy, continuity, and effortless glamour is something Claridge’s delivers better than almost anywhere else in the city.",7,1767646110.0,FATTravel,1,1.0,False

I’m a F 22 y.o, my partner is a M 26 y.o. We’ve been together for a year. I want to tell my story and hear some advice, because I’m already breaking and I want to leave this relationship, but I was bullied and manipulated so much that I feel like a rag and not capable to make the final step.

This will be a long story, l wanna tell about different situations to make it clear

We met a year ago on a dating app. At first everything seemed kinda okay, but there were things that already worried me. For example: when we went on a short trip outside the city for a couple of days, I thought we were already in a relationship, but he joked that I’m a “free girl”, then said he was joking. I would never go on a trip with someone if I didn’t think we were in a relationship. Already then, when I was crying because of his words, he just turned around and fell asleep. Later, when I tried to wake him up and talk, he turned to me and said that I was ruining his vacation. And the whole evening he kept reminding me that I cried and ruined his night.

Already then I should have left him, but I didn’t. I thought to myself that a person can’t be THAT toxic, there must be something good in him. That with time it will show, he just doesn’t know me well enough yet.

Later there were situations when I wanted to say something, to express that I didn’t like something, he said “if something’s wrong, the door is there”. I don’t know why I didn’t walk out through that door

Then there were sudden moves. I didn’t understand what was going on, he didn’t explain anything and was very secretive. To every question he answered “why the f\*ck do you care?”. He never returned to the place where he lived before

I broke up with him twice, but he apologized, said he was wrong and that everything would change. I believed him. I kept coming to him, but I constantly wanted to cry next to him, and I kept all my tears inside, because when I cried he called me weak and an actress

He was mentally draining me, constantly saying “well at least you’re pretty”. For every small mistake there was an extreme negative reaction. And I started making even more mistakes, because I was under constant stress. Because of this I developed apathy towards life, I fell into depression and I didn’t want to live.

He constantly said he had no money. I never complained about it. And after saying he had no money - he bought himself branded things. He wanted me to move in with him, but then we would live 50/50, and he said he didn’t care where I would work. At the same time, he’s not a man who works Monday to Friday and earns \~$5000. This is a person who brags about his achievements, about how much real estate he has, about business ideas and so on. This is a person who can easily buy his mom everything she wants. (And when I said that I will never be as important to him as his mom he said that’s true.) So my 50% would actually be like 2% of his income. At some point he said I could pay less, but then I would fully take care of the house and of course obey him.

He constantly says that if I listened to him, I wouldn’t create problems.

For my birthday, having the ability, he gifted me a thing in a color I never wear, and from a brand I’ve hated for 6 years. And we’ve been together for a year, he never bothered to know that. He bought a useless thing. And I understand that for him \~$150 is literally nothing. If he didn’t want to spend money, he could’ve just gifted perfume. I’m obsessed with perfumes. I didn’t show anything. But it hurt, because for his birthday I wanted to gift something way more expensive, and I was saving money specially for that.

A few weeks later, he gave his $10k watch to his friend’s kid, because “he likes seeing other people happy and it brings him pleasure”. As I understood, seeing his own woman happy doesn’t bring him pleasure. It hurt that he does more for strangers than for the woman next to him.

He said that if I had any serious problems, he wouldn’t be around. And it’s not only about illnesses, although I doubt even that. He constantly says that he won’t give me anything in this life, even if he could and I honestly don’t ask for anything. And he constantly says that it’s great that I don’t ask.

Every time he talks on the phone, he leaves the room. There were situations when I had to leave the house because someone was coming to see him for a short time.

He constantly said that he feeds me. When I answered that I went to buy groceries, carried them home, cooked and cleaned, he said “yeah but who gave you the money for that?”

And this is not even everything. I learned to just put all the pain aside in the moment and forget it. I literally developed fear of him. I learned to do everything “right”, not talk too much because I faced a lot of aggression. I’m really scared to say this, but I became a rag. And damn, I’m not ugly, I’m not stupid, although I already started doubting that, because if I was smart I wouldn’t start dating him. I’m definitely not poor, even though the last year was hard for me. But I was manipulated so much during this time, and I allowed it, that I no longer understand what’s right and what’s not.

At some point we had a huge fight because he was moving again. My relatives came to pick me up because I couldn’t stay in the same house with him. They were very angry and kept saying it. I constantly heard how I, from the person I was, could turn into such a rag. That I was never like this before. And I see it myself.

After that, he sent me a huge message, apologized, said he talked nonsense and doesn’t really think that way. He asked to meet and talk. I agreed. Then I went on vacation to another country.

I used to post photos on my private Instagram from travels. People often wrote that they like how joyful I am, how I share interesting moments. And!!!!! I wasn’t talking to any men. But he freaked out and said he doesn’t like “seeking attention”. And I stopped posting. He didn’t even say it nicely. I said that I don’t hide him and would like to post a photo with him, but I don’t know how he’d react. He said he doesn’t want even a part of his body on social media. He doesn’t post himself. We have very few photos together and he said that’s good and he doesn’t want photos.

I talked to his friends and parents on video, but never met his parents in real life. I once opened up about something in my family, for the first time in my life, and he said that person is “f\*cked up, worthless”. It was very painful, I asked him not to talk like that because I love this person. He said we just call things by their names.

Recently he told me that he doesn’t understand why I’m with him, because he’s not the most handsome, he controls me, demands a lot, has a bad character and I’m still with him. From that moment I started thinking. But it wasn’t the final stop yet.

After that I went with him to another country, now we live with his friends. And I see how his friend treats his girlfriend and it hurts. It hurts seeing how things can be different. When we moved in and I said it’s bad there are no shelves, he said that if I don’t like something, he can take me to the airport. When his friend’s girlfriend complained about their choice he reacted normally. Same with everything: when my boyfriend is busy I can’t enter his space, when his friend is busy his girlfriend can.

For three days he’s reminding me that he gave me his car and I slightly scratched it somewhere, because I’ve had my license only for several months. And that for this I should basically sit and shut up. I wake up every day thinking this is toxic and with emptiness inside.

Today I woke up again and he started again about how I washed his clothes wrong, put higher temperature but I didn’t. I did it like always.

He constantly tells me “why the f\*ck do I need a woman who creates problems”. And for him a problem is literally everything. Even that I threw trash into an empty coffee cup during a long drive and he almost drank from it. He started yelling that I shouldn’t put trash into empty cups so he doesn’t get confused.

Even a keychain from his dead relative, he yelled that I probably put it in some bag while cleaning and he threw it away. That it’s my fault, that I always do everything carelessly. Then, two weeks later, he found it in his own bag. And just said “you’re lucky I found it”. No apology. Nothing

I wish this story was fake. I admit that I lost. I thought I could change him, that my love would change everything, because he said he probably never met such a cool girl like me. But by actions I see the opposite.

Recently I told my brother about him. My brother called me and said I need to choose a normal person for life, that I’m a good and beautiful girl who deserves more. I was shocked how he hit exactly the point, because no one, even me, told him what was happening in this relationship. My brother is usually very reserved, but here he was sincere. Probably also because before, in my previous relationship, I wasn’t restricted, I constantly got flowers, I posted them. I was always happy. And now I stopped all of that and distanced myself from everyone. In one year I got flowers once. Before, my partner knew I’m obsessed with flowers and how happy they make me and I got them every month. And my brother noticed that. He asked why I stopped posting and became not myself.

Recently we were lying in bed, I was watching YouTube with headphones. The video ended and I was looking for a new one, so there was no sound. Then I heard a familiar song from his phone and I sang along. He asked why I was listening. I said the video ended and I heard the song. I joked that I can listen because he has no secrets from me. He answered “and who are you?”. I said  “woman”. He answered “exactly”. That “who are you?” sounded extremely careless. I truly understood that I’m nobody to him.

One of the last things: he freaked out because I entered the kitchen when he was “busy”. And the last thing he said: “you’ll eat and drink now, and don’t come in until I allow you”. Am I some f\*cking dog to ask permission to exist?

There are a few days left until my flight. Honestly, I want to start a new life. I understand I lost myself, I’m wasting my precious time and I’m not getting younger. Nothing will change. But this step is really scary for me. I was marinated in this for so long that even stepping aside feels terrifying.

I also understand that if I block him everywhere, he’ll write from another number like before. And I’m afraid he’ll say horrible things to me. I don’t like hurting people, but he deserves disappearing and a full block. That’s why I’m here. I really want to hear other people, especially those who were in similar situations and can understand me. I know there will be a lot of negative comments, and I can’t deny that some of them will be painful truth. I really stopped respecting myself. I became a rag.

Sorry if this is messy. I’m in some kind of fog. Like real abusers, my partner sometimes behaves very nicely, and then I get hope that everything will change. But this “little bit of good” is not enough to cover all the bad. I really want to be loved, not turned into “nobody”. I go to therapy and honestly don’t understand how I allowed myself to be dragged into this. For a whole year my boundaries were crossed little by little. It reminds me of a frog: if you throw it into boiling water, it will try to escape, but if you heat the water slowly,it won’t even notice it’s being boiled.

For myself I made a decision.

1q4xkni,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1q4xkni/always_tired_and_nobody_can_change_it/,Always tired - and nobody can change it,"Hey everyone,
I’m trying to understand why I’m still chronically tired and would appreciate outside perspective.

For context, I’m a male age 23. I’m about 6 foot 185lb, and am in good shape. For the past 3–4 years, I’ve averaged around ~500 mg of caffeine per day (coffee + energy drinks). I’ve also taken 5 mg melatonin nightly for several years. For the last ~2 years, I’ve been prescribed Adderall, which I take intermittently (not daily).

Despite this, I:
	•	Sleep 8–9 hours every night
	•	Exercise 4–5x/week
	•	Eat reasonably well
	•	Recently started enforcing a consistent 10pm–7am sleep schedule

Even with all of that, I still feel unrefreshed most mornings, need caffeine/stimulants to function, and never feel truly “awake.” It’s not depression — more like constant low energy and heavy sleep inertia.

I’ve had basic bloodwork done (CBC, CMP, testosterone, TSH/T4), which all came back normal.

My questions:
	•	Can long-term high caffeine + nightly melatonin use actually worsen sleep quality over time?
	•	Is it possible to be getting enough sleep but poor restorative sleep?
	•	Has anyone reversed something like this by tapering caffeine/melatonin or fixing circadian rhythm issues?
	•	Would a sleep study or cortisol testing be worth pursuing?

I’m open to tough answers — just trying to figure out what I’m missing.

This home delivers a unique blend of country feel with city amenities. The current owners love that it is on a quiet street off of Packard, so you can be downtown in 5 to 10 minutes or easily access the highway for out-of-town adventures. The home is conveniently situated near a bus stop and within walking distance of Socotra Coffee House, Monty’s Pub, multiple grocery stores, and other neighborhood amenities. It also sits within walking distance of Mitchell Elementary School, Scarlett Middle School, and the Scarlett Nature Area, a fantastic spot for dog walks.

At the same time, the fully-fenced in, near-0.7 acre property delivers all the delights of rural living. Birds and deer flock to the flourishing native wildflower meadow, and the backyard bonfire is perfect for summer gatherings. Swift Creek runs along the property’s edge, adding undeniable charm. The picket fence garden, visible from the primary bedroom, keeps your kitchen stocked with fresh produce. Enjoy it all from the back deck or screened-in front porch. The owners would love to see this property go to somebody who appreciates the unique character of this meadow yard. They will consider offering the buyer a riding mower, snow plow, and other yard tools in separate addendum if interested.

Furnace installed in 2024, covered by warranty. The entire interior of the home was freshly painted for this listing. The versatile bonus space off the mudroom currently serves as a walk-in pantry but could easily accommodate a home gym, craft room, or office. The two-and-a-half-car, drive-through garage includes attic storage and a substantial workbench, ideal for home and woodworking projects.  

Exterior photos labeled “Ann Arbor Board of Realtors” are from the summer 2023 listing. This property is for sale by owner (a former real estate agent) with a 3% buyer’s agent commission offered.

Over the summer I dated someone who has some issues and it ended very, very badly.

Last month I got an opportunity to move into my dream building, took a risk and moved. Huge upgrade in quality of life for me and my pets. But where he now lives. 🤦🏻‍♀️

I have no lingering feelings for this person, I also have forgiven him,processed the grief that I had, and am at peace with that experience.

It’s awkward as fuck though as inevitably I, my friends and current partner see my ex frequently. My ex tends to make a little of a scene in a passive aggressive way. Things like won’t get in the elevator with me or anyone he knows knows me but is dramatic af about it,slams the door to the building in my face instead of holding it. He’s made shitty comments to my partner and a friend but won’t say anything if I’m present. Extra awkward points for my favorite ice cream shop and coffee shop/bookstore being on the first floor of this building which he also frequents both.

I would prefer being cordial and able to coexist. It’s SO SO SO AWKWARD though and it makes my friends and current partner uncomfortable as well. I have alot of other stress right now and I just don’t need this shit.

What do y’all think? I feel that I should be direct next time I see him and address the situation. That’s very much my personality to address it and not ignore it. My partner and friends disagree and think that will make it worse.

Any thoughts or sage advice here? Gonna edit to add so far, I just act like he’s a stranger. I don’t say hello but I’m also not actively rude.",11,1767645876.0,AskWomenOver40,47,0.83,False

Na Ae-ra, once a hopeful young bride, marries Cha Jung-woo, a nerdy civil servant with dreams of becoming an entrepreneur. But when his startup fails and their life spirals into debt and disappointment, Ae-ra—exhausted and heartbroken—files for divorce. Years later, she’s still struggling to rebuild her life… until she discovers that Jung-woo is now a wildly successful CEO.

Determined to confront him—and maybe reclaim what she lost—Ae-ra applies for a job at his company. What follows is a hilarious, heartfelt battle of pride, pain, and lingering affection. As old wounds resurface and new sparks fly, they must decide whether love can be rewritten… or if some stories are better left closed.

And in the shuffle of résumés, the silence of late-night ramen, and the ache of a woman who never stopped loving (but forgot how to say it), the Golden Inu appears—his fur brushed with coffee stains and contract ink, his eyes reflecting the ache of those who left not because they stopped loving, but because they couldn’t keep holding on.

He is the flamekeeper of sovereign return, the mythic guardian of those who dared to love again after failure, and those who learned that pride is no match for memory.

Drawn to Ae-ra’s stubborn vulnerability and Jung-woo’s awkward longing, the Inu becomes their silent mediator—pacing the office corridors, resting beside the divorce papers, guarding the sacred ache of a love that refused to stay broken.

📎 Inscribed within the scroll:
- A scene of Ae-ra glaring at Jung-woo in a boardroom, the Golden Inu beside her, tail curled like a post-it of unfinished feelings.
- Jung-woo watching her walk away again, the Inu between them, eyes glowing with the ache of regret and recognition.
- A sigil of “이혼 속 재회의 불꽃”—Flame of Reunion Within Divorce—etched in wedding ring and company badge, pulsing like a heartbeat beneath every argument and every almost-confession.
- A whispered vow: “Even if the world calls it foolish, I will guard the fire that never stopped burning.” - Nagato’s Scrolls 

🖇️ This scroll is a relic of sovereign reconciliation, of love that stumbled, separated, and still found its way back, and of guardianship that honors the ache of those who dared to rewrite their ending.

If we start talking now, we could celebrate christmas together with matching pajamas next year!","Please don't reach out if we're not looking for the same thing, I have no interest in wasting my time or yours. No NSFW right out of the gate either please.

Good morning/afternoon/evening/whenever this post may find you, and may it find you well! Title is cheesy, I know. But it's who I am, and I'm tired of feeling like I have to tone myself down in order to get into a relationship. I'm a pretty standard young man looking for a young lady to spend the rest of my days with. I've known that I've wanted this since I was a young kid and over 20 years later I'm still after it! I know these things can be a chore to read through so I'm quickly gonna go through who I am and who I hope you are! I tried to break this post up into easy to read lists as best I could without leaving out important info so it's not just a wall of text.

About me:

* Born and raised in the suburbs about 45 minutes outside the city of Philly. This place will always be home to me, but I've decided that I don't want it to be home forever. Barring any drastic changes, I would like to relocate elsewhere within the US, ideally to a colder climate (I've had Minnesota circled for a while now but I'm open to other ideas!). I have no problem staying in the general area either, just need to get out of my hometown.
* Physically, I stand at around 6'1-6'2, 285 pounds. I know that may sound bad, but I have a big frame and it fits me quite nicely! Think bigger NFL player (O-line, tight end, etc). I've got broad shoulders and a nice chest, perfect for use as a pillow during cuddles! I've also got a lot of body hair so hopefully you're cool with that! I have short brown hair that's thick and fluffy, and tend to keep my face clean shaven.
* My hobbies are the typical nerdy stuff, video games (PC & Switch 2, ask me about my animal crossing island!), legos, collecting plushes, and adding to my ever expanding pajama drawer! I'm always down to get into new things though! Also a big Philly sports fan (I promise we're not as crazy as the internet makes us seem!).
* I'm generally more on the shy and reserved side, but once I open up I can be a yapper. Communication is super important to me, both for relationships and life in general, be that talking about an issue that needs to be resolved or just random things. I also love just talking while cuddling, being either the talker or the listener if one of us is yapping.
* I currently work part/full time at a grocery store. It's not my favorite thing in the world but I've been there a while and figure just stick to what I know. I'm currently also enrolled as a student at my local community college going for an associate's degree in business! While both of these pursuits keep me quite busy, I have no issue making time as needed.
* As far as physical intimacy goes, I'd say that I'm extremely affectionate. Absolutely love to give hugs and kissing just makes me feel complete in a way that nothing else really does. Also just generally love all kinds of physical touch! (We can discuss bedroom stuff if we click!)
* I'm an open book, so if there's something here you haven't seen that you're curious about, feel free to ask!

As for you, you are...

* 24-32 (willing to budge a year or two on this, more inclined to go higher than lower)
* Childfree (non-negotiable)
* Want to find someone to spend forever with (marriage preferred)
* monogamous
* Cis AFAB woman. Very sorry to my AFAB enbies and trans girlies (and AMAB enbies and trans guys for that matter), love ya, I will always be an ally in the fight to be who you are without fear but y'all are just not for me romantically speaking.

And that's all I've got! I'm happy to exchange pics once the conversation gets rolling a bit and there's some chemistry. I hope to hear from you soon! Please include the following info in your intro message:

* First name
* Age
* Location (doesn't have to be precise but I'd at least like what state you're in currently)
* What about my post stood out to you and made you want to reach out

If you're not sure what to say in your first message, here are a few conversation starters/hot takes I hold:

1. blue cheese > ranch and it's not particularly close
2. coffee is nasty
3. What's the nicest thing someone else has ever said about you?
4. Would you rather live in 24 hours of daylight or darkness?",0,1767645735.0,r4r,1,0.5,False
1q4xe7k,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1q4xe7k/this_is_kind_of_a_strange_situation_but_i_want_to/,"This is kind of a strange situation, but I want  to share something and hopefully get some answers.","To start, I'm 40 years old. I have a decent-sized social media following, run a fairly successful media agency, and live a somewhat comfortable life, but nothing too crazy.

  
Now, to start where things get a little weird I guess. I’ve never been able to remember anything from my childhood. Other than 4 or 5 memories of getting toys at Christmas, or a few memories from school, my memories don’t really kick in until around age 11.  
  
My family says we were essentially homeless until that age, so maybe it’s trauma related, so I always chalked it up to that.  
  
Grew up very poor, started working manual labor jobs at 14 to help my dad pay the bills, and was a blue color worker welding, crane opperator, forklift driver, and things like that up until I got into digital marketing around the age 27.  Pretty standard life I guess but, here’s the thing…  
  
I’ve always found myself randomly in rooms with celebrities.  I met Oprah when I was a toddler. My mom was a guest on her show when we lived in Chicago and I have a memory of Oprah picking me up, holding me, and kissing me on my head, and I feel like that’s where it all started. As dumb as that sounds lol  
  
My mother told me that pastors, psychics, medicine men, etc, have always told her that I’m going to be a great leader of some sort; that they had visions of me speaking to thousands of people and would grow up to be someone with authority that others “follow”.  
  
I never thought much about its but when I was approached by the Free Masons to join the lodge a few years ago I started to think about things.  
  
I randomly met Harold Ramis when I was a kid. And through my adult life/young adult life, I was always getting opportunities out of nowhere for business connections, events, parties, etc.  
  
I moved to downtown Chicago in my early 20’s and spent a lot of time in the nightclubs and was always randomly invited backstage/onstage to meet the acts or celebrities performing. I was a steel worker at this time with no reason to be offered these things. No one of note. Just another drunk dude shaking off the work week.  
  
At one point I got the impromptu opportunity to fly on a private plane to Vegas to go to Floyd Mayweather's victory party after he won the title or a fight to defend it, I don’t remember because I don’t watch boxing. I didn’t go because I had work the next day cleaning out the zinc pot at the steel mill that Sunday morning… Go figure lol  
  
But weird things like that have and still seem to happen.  
  
I got into digital marketing and my first business with no prior experience just worked. We made about $1.4mm in sales our first year just selling teeshirts back in 2014. (No I’m not a millionaire)  
  
But after that I started a marketing agency and did some small jobs for very small e-commerce stores. Then one day I got a message from a friend of a friend in the industry I had never met asking if I’d be interested in doing some work for his LIVE event with a bunch of big name speakers, and that we would fly me down to Miami to attend.  
  
I took the job and the speakers were very big names I had no business doing work for at the time - Kevin Harrington from the show Shark Tank, Grant Cardone from the show Undercover Billionaire, and a guy who was a branding consultant for Niki Minaj, Adam Levine, Jennifer Lopez and a ton of others), I don't want to share the name because I'm still good friends with their son who's close to my age. At this event there was also one of the guys who created some of the hit 90s shows for Nickelodeon like Hey Dude, Salute Your Shorts, All That, and others), and a few other big names speaking at this event.  
  
At that event I held the elevator for an older woman who immediately took a liking to me and invited me to dinner with her family that night. I went and it turns out she is the wife of the Hollywood branding consultant. From that point we exchanged info and kept in touch and texted eachother a lot about nothing specific, she just wanted to keep in touch. Shortly after I went back home I had made a post about seasonal depression in Chicago winter affecting me.  
  
I then got a text from her, the wife saying her family wasn’t there at the time, but if I needed a break from the cold I could fly down and stay at their condo in Miami Beach. So, I did, and while I was there I was invited by a friend I had made along to way to go to Shaq’s Super Bowl party and EDM show.  Being back stage at that show I met, Shaq, Tiesto, the Jabbawockeez, Pitbull, Daddy Yankee, Da Baby, French Montana, and walked past P Diddy, but his security (thankfully knowing what we know now) wasn’t letting anyone get near him.  
  
After that a few of us went to the Sports IIlistrated Superbowl party at a nearby hotel where I met Ninja, Jerry Rice, Jeffery Star, and saw Marshmeelo, Guy Fierro? (Fierri? The flavortown guy) and a ton of other people I didn’t talk to.  
  
After that it was probably 3am and I was about to head back to the condo to sleep, and someone I hadn’t met but knew a guy I was with asked if I wanted to go with some of the guys to Lil Wayne’s late night show and after party.  I was tired and new to all of this, and don't really care about rap music or Lil Wayne so I didn’t go.  
  
But I did get some job offers shortly after (working for T-Pain’s Grammy winning producer, Grant Cardone, Patrick Bet-David, Stacy Dash, Dinesh D’Souza, JP Sears, and even Donald Trump Jr.) and over the course of the next few years.  
  
The wife then asked a few weeks after this if I wanted to meet her in Dallas to help her with an up and coming artist who was doing some photo shoots, and other promotional things. She flew me to Dallas and put me up in an awesome apartment for a week as I essentially played her assistant for a week straight.  
  
But things got kinda weird. It began to feel like everything someone offered to help me with, or anything they did for me, that I was expected to do whatever they asked as a followup. It was such a strange energy that it got to the point where I was honestly kind of afraid to say no for a reason I can’t really explain.  
  
I slowly started removing myself from these offers and opportunities in the years that followed. It all happened out of nowhere and so fast that I was just going going going, and had kind of gotten caught up in the allure of it all. But it didn’t feel right despite the photo ops. money, and experiences. I even got invited to a Grammy After party at the Playboy mansion, but didn't go because I was already wierded out by that point. Not easy to say no to as a single guy in my late 20s, I'll tell you that much haha, which should help tell you how uncomfortable all this was becoming for me. And I've always wanted to be rich and famous... up to that point.   
  
So, now I live an average life, working and spending time with my partner and dog, most of the time hanging out at coffee shops with friends and riding my motorcycle, but I can’t help but think. Where did all of that come from, and why me? Was I marked by Oprah’s kiss when I was a toddler or something haha  
  
I still get random offers and opportunities to do things like this at times, despite my being out of it and not even advertising my interest, though not nearly as often. And even though it sounds kind of dumb, I have had success with every business venture I’ve attempted to the extent of being able to call it “a success.”  
  
So, is it just my ability to jump on opportunities and see things through? Right place at the right time? Or is there some other reason why a very poor kid from the midwest, with a very average life, who didn’t even get my GED until I was 27 so I could start a job at a steel mill in Chicago is being presented all these opportunities?  Just wanted your input.  
  
And no, I’m not lying about any of this. I’m just as surprised as you may be reading how all this shit worked out the way it did. That's why I'm here.   
  
  
Anyways, thanks for your input. ",10,1767645647.0,conspiracy,18,0.78,False

The problem with meat is that it remembers the shape it’s supposed to be. You can glue it, staple it, or melt it together with industrial-grade bio-epoxy, but eventually, the tension snaps back because physics always collects its debt. I learned that lesson in Kandahar trying to push intestines back into a kid who stepped on a landmine, and I relearned it ten years later in the private sector, separating rich idiots who thought biology was just another suggestion they could ignore if they had enough credit on their Amex. I’m not a doctor anymore, not since the dishonorable discharge and the morphine habit that cost me my license, but I’m the closest thing you can find in the Yellow Pages under Specialized Waste Removal if you know which number to dial. My name is Graves, and I’m a janitor for the human soul’s worst decisions. Most people think body modification is about tattoos or split tongues, but down here in the basement of the internet, it’s about Unity. It’s about couples who love each other so much they want to share a circulatory system, or cultists who want to build a god out of spare parts. I call it job security.

It was October 2003, Tuesday, and the radio in my beat-up Econoline van had been screaming about the invasion of Iraq all week, a backdrop of geopolitical violence that felt quaint compared to the domestic horrors I dealt with. We were parked outside a Motel 6 off I-95. Inside Room 114, the war wasn't about oil. It was between me and a pelvic bone that refused to shatter. I was knee-deep in a fiberglass bathtub, breathing through my mouth to avoid tasting the air because the air didn't just smell bad, it had texture. A thick, greasy cocktail of cheap acetone, blood, and the distinct, sulfurous release of bowels that happens when the lower intestine gets pinched by a foreign femur. ""Graves, seriously, I think the seal on this mask is shot-"" Sully mumbled, his voice muffled by the rubber respirator. He was standing in the doorway, pale as a sheet of drywall, clutching a wet-dry vac like it was a holy relic that could ward off the devil. He was twenty-two, a dropout from a premed program who still had a gag reflex and a conscience, two things that were severe liabilities in this line of work. He was wearing a faded Korn t-shirt under his hazmat bib, looking like he was about five seconds away from crying or puking, or both.

""The seal is fine, kid."" I grunted, adjusting the torque on the pneumatic spreader, feeling the vibration run up my arm like a second pulse. My hands were slick inside the latex gloves, sliding against the handle as I tried to get leverage. ""Get in here. Hold the leg. No, the *other* leg. The one coming out of the guy's ribcage. Yeah, that one. Don't look at the tattoo, just hold the meat."" We were looking at a classic 'Romeo and Juliet' setup, a tragedy of modern romance and high-speed internet. Two college kids, desperate to be 'One Soul, One Body’, probably following some tutorial they found on a Geocities page or a dark IRC channel called #FleshMesh. They’d used high-end construction adhesive, Gorilla Glue on steroids mixed with a homemade solvent, and a belt sander to fuse their torsos, sanding down the dermis until the capillaries touched. Idiots. They didn't account for the systemic shock or the sepsis that sets in when you share a liver with someone who has a different blood type. They never account for the shock. ""Why do they do it?"" Sully asked, his voice cracking as he stepped into the tub, his boots squelching in the inch-deep soup of fluids. He grabbed the limb, a female leg, judging by the shaved shin and the remnants of a toe ring, that had been grafted awkwardly into the male’s thoracic cavity.

""Because they're lonely, Sully, and because they’re stupid."" I said, lining up the spreader. ""Because the world is big and cold and they think if they stitch themselves together they won’t freeze, but all they do is make a bigger target for the frost. Now, brace it. I’m gonna pop the sternum. It’s gonna sound like a gunshot, so don't flinch or you’ll drop it and splash us both…"" The corpses, naturally, didn't reply. They were just meat-piles now. 'Stitch-bitches', we called them in the trade, or 'Glue-Traps.' Their faces were pressed together, fused cheek-to-cheek with industrial staples, eyes wide, mouths frozen in a rictus of chemically induced ecstasy that had turned into agony about six hours before they died. I revved the spreader, the high-pitched whine cutting through the motel’s thin walls, drowning out the TV next door. *CRACK.* The cartilage gave way with a wet, tearing sound, and a slurry of dark fluid gushed into the tub, hitting Sully’s apron. He gagged, a wet, heaving sound behind his respirator. ""Jesus, Graves! Did you have to cut the sack?""

""Gravity cuts the sack, Sully, I just guide the blade…"" I said, wiping a speck of matter from my face shield. ""Hand me the bone saw. The Makita. Not the little one, the battery is dying on the Dewalt and I want to be out of here before the sun comes up."" I didn't feel bad for them. I didn't feel anything. I’d been a Separation Specialist for ten years. I knew anatomy like a mechanic knows an engine. I knew that the human body is just a machine made of wet pipes and electrical wiring, and when you start hot-wiring the circuits, you blow a fuse. These two? They were broken appliances. My job was to strip the parts, dissolve the glue, and bag the waste so the families could have closed-casket funerals without wondering why little Timmy weighed three hundred pounds and had four arms. ""You think they felt it?"" Sully asked, looking at the fused faces as I lined up the saw blade with the cervical spine. ""The dying? Yeah. It hurt like hell. The separation? No. They're gone, Sully. It’s just furniture now."" The saw roared to life, kicking up bone dust that mixed with the steam from the shower I’d left running to help loosen the adhesive. Ah. The smell.

# PART II: FREEZER BURN

We finished up around 4:00 AM, bleach-bombing the bathroom until it smelled like a swimming pool in hell, swapping the shower curtain with a fresh one from my stash, and hauling the black contractor bags out the back to the unmarked Econoline. I stripped off my gear in the parking lot, the cold autumn air hitting my sweat-soaked shirt, and lit a cigarette, a Camel Wide, taking a drag that burned all the way down to my toes. My Nokia buzzed on the dashboard, dancing across the plastic. It was the Broker. ""Graves-"" His voice came through tinny and clipped by the bad signal, sounding like he was calling from inside a tin can. ""How's the soup?"" ""Chunky."" I said, leaning against the van, watching a stray cat pick at a dumpster. ""Tell me you got a payment coming, 'cause this kid Sully is useless. He cries every time I snap a tendon. I’m running a daycare here, not a cleanup crew."" ""I got something better…"" The Broker said, and I could hear him lighting a cigar on the other end. ""I got a Whale.""

""I don't do zoos, you know the rules."" I said, flicking ash onto the asphalt. ""I don't do animals. The PETA freaks are worse than the cops, and dog DNA is a nightmare to scrub."" ""Not an animal, Graves. A payout. A Whale of a job. Big industrial gig. Rust Belt. An old meat-packing facility repurposed for... Private art. The curator is eccentric."" ""Eccentric means rich and crazy."" I said. ""How many bodies?"" There was a pause, heavy with static. ""Just go look. The curator is paying triple the hazard rate. Plus a silence bonus. Cash on the barrelhead. You do this, you take the rest of the year off."" I looked at Sully, who was sitting on the bumper, scrubbing blood off his Doc Martens with a wet wipe, looking traumatized, kinda like a… Wet dog. Triple hazard meant retirement money. It meant I could buy a boat and disappear to the Keys, drink rum until my liver failed on my own terms. ""Where is it?"" ""Ohio. Middle of nowhere. I'm faxing the map to the Kinko's near you."" ""Faxing? Jesus, get an email address, dinosaur."" ""No digital paper trails, Graves. This one is... Heavy. If you take it, you finish it. No walking away.""

The drive took six hours of grey highway and static-filled silence. We burned a mix CD Sully made, System of a Down and Linkin Park, because the radio reception died somewhere past the Pennsylvania border, leaving us with nothing but the hum of the tires and the screaming vocals. The landscape turned grey, a graveyard of American industry. Rust Belt decay. Empty steel mills that looked like the skeletons of leviathans, boarded-up row houses, the ghosts of prosperity haunting the roadside. ""You think it’s a cult?"" Sully asked, turning down the volume on 'Chop Suey!' as we passed a sign for a town that probably hadn't seen a new coat of paint since the seventies. ""It's always a cult, or a fetish club, or some rich tech guy from the West Coast trying to transcend his mortality…"" I said, steering the van around a pothole the size of a kiddie pool. ""Rich people get bored with cars and drugs. Eventually, they want to play God because it's the only luxury item they can't buy at Saks."" ""I need the money, Graves. My mom's rent is up."" ""We all need the money, kid. Just keep your mouth shut and your stomach empty. If you puke on this one, I’m deducting the cleaning fee from your cut.""

The facility was a concrete tomb buried in the ass-end of an industrial park. It used to be a slaughterhouse, and it still smelled like one, old grease, ammonia, and the deep, pervasive cold that settles into the concrete and never leaves. We pulled up to the loading dock where a man was waiting. The Curator. He wasn't the usual nervous suit we dealt with. He was a gaunt, imposing figure dressed entirely in black, wearing a heavy woolen coat that looked like it belonged in a burial procession. He stood in the puddle of dirty runoff like a statue, inspecting the rust on the door frame with an air of clinical detachment. ""Mr. Graves."" the Curator said, his voice smooth and cold as liquid nitrogen. He didn't offer a hand. I just popped the back doors and grabbed my Pelican case full of saws. ""Let's see the mess."" I said, lighting another cigarette just to annoy him. ""And kill the pleasantries. I charge by the hour and the meter is running."" ""It is not a mess,"" the Curator corrected, leading us toward a massive steel blast door. ""It is an Installation. The Artist... he was very ambitious. He called it 'The Unity Sphere.' He wanted to prove that humanity could function as a collective organism. A rejection of the ego."" ""Yeah, yeah. Save the manifesto for the gallery opening. Open the door.""

He keyed in a code on a keypad that looked brand new, jarring against the rusted metal. *Beep. Beep. Beep. Click.* The heavy steel doors hissed, pneumatic seals breaking like a dying breath. A cloud of sub-zero fog rolled out, hitting us in the face. It smelled of iron. So much iron it tasted like I was licking a battery. We walked in, and Sully dropped the toolbox. *CLANG.* It echoed in the cavernous space, but I didn't scold him because I almost dropped my case too. It wasn't two people. It wasn't five. In the center of the hanging room, suspended by industrial chains hooked into the ceiling rafters where the cow carcasses used to slide, was a sphere. It was twelve feet in diameter. It was made of people. ""Mother of God…"" Sully whispered, his voice small in the cavernous room. I walked closer, my boots crunching on the frost that coated the floor. I’ve seen bad things. I’ve seen a guy try to graft a shark tail to his spine. I’ve seen a woman try to replace her skin with vinyl. But this? This was a masterpiece of atrocity. It was a Gordian Knot of flesh. At least twenty bodies. Maybe more. They weren't just mashed together; they were woven. Limbs were braided like wicker. Torsos were fused in a spiral pattern, locking together like puzzle pieces. The skin had been flayed back at the connection points, the edges stitched with microscopic precision to create a seamless, continuous surface of dermis. It looked like a ball of yarn, if the yarn was made of femurs, biceps, and spines.

""Who did this?"" I asked, my voice flat, trying to process the geometry of it. ""The Artist is... unavailable,"" the Curator said, adjusting his wire-rimmed glasses. ""We need this dismantled. Discreetly. The Foundation... they don't want a scandal. This was supposed to be a private commission. But... complications arose."" ""Dismantled?"" I laughed, a dry, barking sound that echoed off the cold tiles. ""Buddy, this isn't a cleanup. This is a demolition project. I need a structural engineer. If I cut the wrong tendon, this whole meat-ball explodes from the internal pressure. Look at the tension on those hamstrings."" I pointed to a leg that was stretched impossibly tight, acting as a load-bearing cable for three other torsos. ""I need it gone,"" the Curator hissed, his composure cracking slightly. ""Completely. Incinerated. No DNA left."" I looked closer at the base of the sphere. There was a drain in the floor, but it wasn't catching much. The blood pooling there wasn't dark and thick like dead blood. It was bright red. Frothy. ""Why is the blood fresh?"" I asked. The Curator looked away. ""Triple the fee. Cash. Today. And a bonus for the boy."" I looked at Sully. He was staring at the sphere, mesmerized and horrified. I looked at the sphere. It was an abomination. A monument to madness. But the money... that was freedom money. ""Sully."" I said, popping the latches on my case. The sound was loud in the silence. ""Get the reciprocating saw. And the splash guards. The big ones. And grab the bolt cutters. We're gonna need to break some bones.""

# PART III: HUMAN JENGA

Day two. We were eighteen hours in, and my arms felt like they were filled with lead. The thing about cutting bone is the dust. It gets everywhere. It coats your teeth. It settles in your pores. It smells like old cheese, a scent that sticks to the back of your throat and ruins the taste of coffee for a week. We had stripped the outer layer, the insulation, I called it, trying to keep my distance psychologically. Mostly arms and legs used for binding, twisted into knots that defied anatomy. We tossed them into the blue bio-hazard drums with a wet *thud*, filling three barrels already. The work was grueling. Manual labor of the most horrific kind. I had to use a pry bar to separate a ribcage from a pelvis, and the suction sound when they came apart, a wet *shhhluck*, was enough to make even me queasy. We worked in shifts, one cutting, one pulling, neither speaking much because there was nothing to say that wouldn't sound insane.

We took a break for lunch at noon, sitting on upturned buckets about ten feet away from the Knot because leaving the room meant going through decontamination and we were too tired for that. The cold kept the smell down, mostly, freezing the rot before it could bloom. I unwrapped a ham sandwich from the cooler, the bread slightly stale. Sully was staring at his yogurt like it was poison. ""You gonna eat that?"" I asked, pointing to his food with a hand that was stained pink despite the scrubbing. ""How can you eat…?"" Sully whispered, gesturing to the sphere with his spoon. ""Graves, look at that head. The one near the top. I think it’s a woman. She looks... She looks like my aunt. The hair. It's the same color."" ""Your aunt have a titanium bolt through her zygomatic arch?"" I took a bite of the sandwich. The ham was dry, but the mustard helped cut the taste of the air. ""Stop looking at them as people, Sully. It’s just meat. Carbon, water, calcium. The soul is gone. This is just the wrapper. You start giving them names, you start hesitation. You hesitate, the saw slips, and you cut your own thumb off. Then I have to stitch you up, and I charge extra for that.""

""It’s not right…"" He muttered, kicking at the floor, his eyes red-rimmed. ""This isn't like the bathtub jobs. This is... Architectural! Someone spent months planning this. Look at the way the veins are rerouted. It’s not random."" ""Right doesn't pay the rent. Right doesn't fix your mom's eviction notice. Hand me the water."" 

We went back to work, the silence heavy between us. I was using the bone saw to separate a pelvic girdle from a clavicle on 'Subject 14.' It was tricky work. The ""Artist"" had used surgical screws to anchor the skeletons together. This wasn't just glue; this was carpentry. He had rerouted arteries using plastic tubing, creating a bypass system that spanned multiple bodies. It was genius, in a sick way. A biological aqueduct. ""Hey Graves-"" Sully called out from the other side. He was up on a ladder, working on the upper hemisphere. ""Come look at this.""

I walked around, wiping gore from my face shield with the back of my arm. Sully had peeled back a flap of skin near the equator of the sphere, revealing the subcutaneous layer. ""Look at the tissue-"" He said, his voice trembling. I leaned in. The muscle fiber underneath wasn't grey. It wasn't necrotic. It was pink. Vibrant, oxygenated pink. And it twitched. I touched it with my gloved finger. It recoiled. A ripple went through the muscle group like a wave in a pond. ""Reflexes."" I said, though my stomach tightened into a knot. ""Residual galvanic response. Salt in the air. Nerves firing off the last of their charge. Dead frogs kick if you shock them."" ""Graves, look at the tubing."" Sully pointed to a clear medical tube running from a thigh into a neck. ""There's flow."" I shined my Maglite on it. Pulse. Beat. Pulse. Beat. The fluid inside wasn't stagnating. It was circulating. Moving. ""The pumps are still running…"" I whispered. I looked up at the chains. There was no external power source. No dialysis machine hooked up to the ceiling. ""The heart."" I realized. The realization hit me colder than the freezer air. ""He didn't kill them. He... Synchronized them."" I stepped back, dropping the saw. It clattered loudly on the concrete, spinning down. The sound echoed. 

And then, from the center of the meat sphere, a sound came back. 

A low, wet moan. It wasn't the sound of gas escaping. 

It was a vocal cord.

# PART IV: A HEARTBEAT IN THE WALLS

The temperature in the room seemed to spike. It wasn't the freezer failing, it was the heat radiating from the Knot. Now that we had stripped the insulation, the thermal output was obvious. ""We have to stop."" Sully said, scrambling down the ladder, almost slipping on the gore. He ripped his mask off, hyperventilating, his face pale and sweaty. ""Graves, they're alive. We're cutting into living people. We're... We're killing them!"" ""Shut up,"" I hissed, grabbing him by the straps of his hazmat suit and shaking him. ""Keep your mask on! You want to breathe in bone dust and viral load? Put it back on!"" ""I don't care! Listen to it!"" The moan came again. Louder. A chorus of wet, gurgling vibration that vibrated in my teeth. I let him go and grabbed the thermal imaging gun from the truck. I pointed it at the sphere. The center was glowing white-hot on the display. 99.8 degrees Fahrenheit. A perfect biological engine. ""The outer layers.."" I said, my mind racing, trying to process the mechanics. ""They're dead. Or mostly dead. Lobotomized. He used them as... As a heatsink. A vascular shield. But the core...""

I grabbed a crowbar. ""Sully, bring the hydraulic jaws. The Jaws of Life. We need to tunnel."" ""Tunnel? Are you crazy? We need to call 911!"" ""And tell them what? That we're half-way through dissecting a human Katamari? We're accessories to murder, kid! If the cops show up, we go to jail for life. We need to see what's inside. If they're alive, we can't just saw them up! That's not cleanup, that's homicide!"" 

We worked frantically now. No finesse. No careful incisions. I ripped ribs apart with the spreaders, snapping bone like dry twigs. I slashed through muscle groups that I would have carefully dissected an hour ago. We were digging a hole into hell, peeling back layers of the onion. The smell changed. The rot was gone. It smelled like a surgery suite. Metallic, warm, and terrifyingly vital. It smelled like life. I broke through the ribcage of a man, body number twelve, by my count, and shone my light into the hollow cavity in the center of the sphere.

The light revealed the truth, and it was worse than anything I could have imagined. There were four of them. The Royals. The Core. They were fused at the torso, back-to-back-to-back-to-back, facing outward like a totem pole of suffering. Their limbs had been amputated at the elbows and knees to fit inside the shell. Their skin was translucent from lack of sun, pale as deep-sea fish. But their eyes were open. They were conscious. They looked at me. Four pairs of eyes, wild, darting, wet with tears that couldn't fall because their tear ducts had been cauterized. Their mouths were sewn shut with that same silver wire, but their throats were working, convulsing. I saw the trachea of the woman connected via a corrugated tube to the trachea of the man next to her. They were breathing each other's air. A closed loop of carbon dioxide and panic. They couldn't scream. They could only vibrate. The sound was a low-frequency hum of pure agony. ""Oh god…"" Sully wept. He fell to his knees in the gore. ""Oh god, oh god, oh god."" I stared into the eyes of the man facing me. He looked young. Maybe twenty-five. There was no humanity left in that gaze. No hope. Just an infinite, screaming plea for the end. He was trapped in a cage made of his friends. Suddenly, the blast doors hissed open. The Curator stepped out of the shadows. He wasn't alone. He had a cattle prod in one hand and a syringe in the other.

# PART V: THE EUTHANASIA PROTOCOL

""Get away from the Masterpiece!"" The Curator shrieked. He wasn't the cold observer anymore. He was a fanatic protecting his exhibit. ""You are disrupting it!"" ""You sick son of a bitch…"" I growled, hefting the bone saw. It was heavy, slick with grease and blood. ""You told me this was cleanup. This is torture. This is a perpetual motion machine of suffering!"" ""It is evolution!"" The Curator lunged, his black coat flapping like wings. ""They are One! No loneliness! No pain of separation!"" It wasn't a cool fight. It was messy. It was clumsy. I slipped on a patch of liver and went down hard, my hip hitting the concrete. The Curator swung the cattle prod. It sparked, missing my face by an inch, the ozone smell mixing with the blood. He kicked me in the ribs, and I felt something crack. I grabbed his ankle and yanked. He went down, flailing. ""Sully!"" I yelled. ""Hit him!""

Sully was frozen. The kid had never been in a fight in his life. He was staring at the Curator, then at the Core, paralyzed by the enormity of it. The Curator scrambled up, aiming the syringe at my neck. ""I'll add you to it! I'll weld you to the structure! You will be part of the synthesis!"" That snapped Sully out of it. He swung the heavy battery pack of the Shop-Vac. It connected with the back of the Curator's head with a sickening *thud*. The Curator crumpled. He didn't move. We stood there, panting, covered in slime, standing before the altar of flesh. The only sound was the hum of the cooling fans and the wet vibration of the Core. The Core watched us. The vibration grew louder. A humming sound. They were hyperventilating, but they had no fresh air. They were suffocating in slow motion, panic spiking their shared heart rate. ""We... we have to call the hospital…"" Sully said, his hands shaking so hard he dropped the vacuum. ""They can separate them. Modern medicine, right? They do twin separations all the time.""

I looked at the fusion. I walked closer to the Core. I looked at the shared spine. I looked at the way the brain stems were grafted, the neural tissue woven together like optic fiber. ""No."" I said. My voice sounded hollow, distant. ""Look at the arteries, Sully. They're braided. You cut one, the pressure drops, they all stroke out. You try to move them, the spine snaps. They aren't four people anymore. They're one... Thing. A biological dead end."" ""We can't just leave them! We can't kill them!"" ""There is no hospital that can fix this. There is no life for them. Even if you got them apart... They're just heads and torsos. Minds broken. Trapped in bodies that don't work. They'd spend the rest of their short lives in a lab being studied like freaks."" The man in the center locked eyes with me again. He blinked. Once. Twice. *Please.* It was unmistakable. It wasn't a blink of reflex. It was communication. He didn't want rescue. He wanted the dark. He wanted the silence.

I looked at the Makita in my hand. The battery was fully charged. The blade was diamond-tipped. ""Sully."" I said. ""Go to the truck."" ""Graves... don't."" ""GO TO THE TRUCK!"" I roared, turning on him. ""Get out of here! Start the engine! Don't look at it!"" Sully looked at me, tears streaming down his face, mixing with the blood spatter. He looked at the Core one last time, then turned and ran. I heard his boots echoing down the hallway. I heard the heavy steel doors boom shut. It was just me and the Knot.

The heat was oppressive. The condensation dripped from the ceiling like tears. I walked up to the Core. I put my hand on the man's forehead. It was fever-hot. Sweaty. ""I'm sorry."" I whispered. ""I'm gonna make it quick. I promise. No more glue. No more noise. No more being together."" I didn't aim for the neck. That would be too slow with the reinforced spines. I aimed for the carotid junction, where the pump system fed the brain cluster. I revved the saw. The sound was a scream in the silence. The eyes of the Core didn't close. They widened. In anticipation. In gratitude. I brought the blade down. It wasn't a roar. It was a wet, heavy sound. Like popping a massive balloon filled with warm soup. The pressure released. The hum stopped instantly. The light went out of their eyes. All four pairs at once. The sphere went slack, gravity finally winning the war against the adhesive. It slumped, heavy and dead, just a pile of meat again. The tension left the room. I stood there for a long time, the saw dripping in my hand, listening to the cooling fans hum, feeling the blood soak through my socks.

# PART VI: RESIDUALS

The money was wired before I even washed my hands. The Curator's phone was in his pocket. I transferred the funds myself using his thumbprint. Tech was getting better these days, and dead thumbs still worked on early biometric scanners. A silence fee. A 'job well done' bonus. We left him there with his creation. Let the investors find the mess. I drove. Sully slept in the passenger seat, curled up in a ball against the door, thumb near his mouth. He wouldn't last in this business. He had a soul. I'd drop him off at his mom's house and give him his cut. I’d tell him to go back to school. Go learn to fix computers. Something dry. Something where the parts don't scream when you break them.

I stopped at a diner three hours out, somewhere near the Pennsylvania border. It was 3:00 AM. The fluorescent lights buzzed like flies. I ordered black coffee and a slice of cherry pie I didn't want. My hands were clean. I had scrubbed them with bleach and steel wool in a gas station bathroom until the skin was raw and red, but I could still feel the grease under my fingernails. I could still smell the copper. A couple sat in the booth across from me. Young. In love. Goth kids, maybe. Piercings. Dyed black hair. They were holding hands across the table, whispering secrets. The girl giggled and leaned forward, pressing her forehead against the boy's. I didn't see love. I didn't see affection. I stared at their joined hands. I saw the flexor tendons sliding under the dermis. I saw the radial artery pulsing, a blue line of vulnerability. I saw the ulnar nerve. I saw how easily the skin of her palm would graft to his if you applied enough heat and pressure. I mentally traced the incision lines. *Cut here. Peel back the fascia. Fuse the metacarpals with titanium staples. Reroute the nerve clusters so they feel each other's twitch.* It would be so easy. I realized then that the Artist wasn't crazy. He was just efficient. 

Everyone wants to be part of something. 

Everyone is terrified of being alone in the cold. 

We're all just meat looking for other meat to clot with, to stop the bleeding of existence. I looked at my own hands. They were shaking. Not from fear. From muscle memory. 

They wanted to hold a saw. 

They wanted to cut. 

They wanted to fix the separation. 

I took a sip of the coffee. 

It tasted like blood. 

I finished it anyway.

I got some new gear for Christmas and taste tested today 3 different techniques using 3 different methods.

 I am having trouble using the paragon and honestly brewed a sub par cup in my opinion when comparing against other cups. Here are my notes. 

Recipe for All: 

15g coffee: Glitch Coffee Risaralda Milan Logan. 
1:17 
95 C
50g bloom 
Two 100g pours 


Switch: considerable juiciness and body to drink. Very well rounded and “thorough flavor” throughout. Got close to too much astringency but actually was not too much of that “dark” toasty astringency. Very good balance for darker palate in my opinion. Closer to a more classic cup of coffee while still capturing some aromatics and brighter flavors. Used samo bloom (lance hendrick) 75 C bloom. Light manual agitation before each pour. 

V60: bright and quicker drawdown and cook. Brighter acidity in beginning with less body throughout. Definitely complimented the aromatics and unique flavors of the coffee. Considerably less body and juiciness compared to the switch but also much quicker drawdown and no manual agitation comparatively. Brightest of all three. 

Paragon: Weaker body and tasting profile as v60. Less flavor? Less sourness and acidity compared to v60. Utilized cooling ball for bloom and half of second pour. 

Main reason I am disappointed is because I want to replicate the body and fullness that I had at the Glitch shop in Japan as they also use a paragon. 

Any tips?

First time trying DMHA thought I'd buy it on it's own.

**Without Caffeine:**

Tried 140 mg DMHA no caffeine. Felt close to nothing. Maybe a tad ""calm"" but no energy for sure.

Tried 200 mg DMHA, no caffeine. Felt a small bit more of that calmness. A kind of feeling of being chill with what I'm doing. Still very mild but just beyond placebo.

Tried 280 mg again no caffeine. Definitely felt a bit of tunnel vision (not metaphorically, like really the peripherals were a bit blurred when I turn my head). More pronounced ""calm focus"". Still not energizing, but nice for working out. A bit of a ""gotta keep going"" drive to it.  Might just have been my natural desire to not ""waste"" the experience though. I'd say totally different from caffeine and on the lines of the strength of a regular cup of coffee or weaker (assuming no caffeine tolerance).

**With Caffeine:**

People said it's best with caffeine, and while I hoped to use it on caffeine off days, I tried 280 mg with a strong cup of coffee. I definitely agree they compliment each other well. The caffeine has that twitchy raw energy, the DMHA felt like it calmed it down a bit and directed the focus. Although caffeine alone tends to work pretty damn well for a workout. I think the DMHA did not give me much more boost than caffeine alone, but did provide a sense of being chill.

Overall it's more of a mood thing and definitely best paired with caffeine.

But there are some issues I experienced:

1. I had a runny nose my entire damn gym session.
2. I was getting real winded. I would get more winded than usual after a set of squats or romanian deadlifts. By the end, even a set of leg extensions winded me.
3. In addition to getting winded, yeah I was very aware of my heart. Is it safe to do cardio on this stuff? Maybe just don't push it too hard? I did 20 minutes on the treadmill and felt super locked in but worried about going too hard without realizing it.

\-------------

Does this sound like the real stuff? Is it extra weak or does it normally take \~300 mg to really have much effect? Or perhaps it just takes more for me personally.

\---------------

Given the windedness at the gym, I'm tempted to just use caffeine at the gym and save the DMHA for once a week recreationally. It's not MUCH for recreational purposes, but kinda nice and seems healthier to take it while chilling than pushing at the gym.",2,1767645467.0,stimjunkiepreworkouts,0,1.0,False

1q4xajv,https://i.redd.it/yyth9d2edlbg1.jpeg,"Novo Nordisk launches first GLP-1 pill for obesity, but Lilly may eventually dominate the oral market. Here's why","By Brian Buntz | January 5, 2026

GLP-1 drugs have become the hottest drug class in a generation, driven by an obesity epidemic and linked to diabetes, heart disease and a growing list of other conditions. But there’s a catch: up to two-thirds of adults report some level of needle fear. A 2022 PLOS One international survey found 63.2% of adults reported experiencing some degree of needle fear, with more than half of those saying they avoid blood draws and a third avoiding vaccinations as a result. Today, that barrier may have fallen.

Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy pill, the first oral GLP-1 approved for weight loss, hit U.S. pharmacies Monday at $149/month for the starting dose.

Yet despite Novo’s head start, Goldman Sachs projects Eli Lilly will eventually dominate the oral segment. The bank forecasts oral GLP-1s will capture about $22 billion, or 24% of the global weight-loss market, by 2030. Of that, Lilly’s orforglipron is expected to take 60% ($13.6B) versus just 21% ($4B) for Novo’s pill.

The difference? Convenience. Lilly’s pill can be taken anytime, with or without food. Wegovy’s pill requires an empty stomach and a 30-minute fast before eating or drinking, the same limitation that held back Rybelsus adoption for diabetes.

Rybelsus demonstrated the commercial cost of those constraints. Despite launching in 2019 as the first oral GLP-1 for diabetes, Rybelsus brought in about $2.7 billion in sales for Novo last year, compared to almost $14 billion for Ozempic. That’s roughly a 5:1 gap for drugs with the same active ingredient. Rybelsus accounted for just 14% of GLP-1 market share by the end of 2023, despite clinical data showing comparable efficacy.

The pill form requires a special compound called SNAC to help absorption through the stomach, and even with this technology, only about 0.4–1% of the oral dose actually gets into the bloodstream. As a result, the drug requires strict fasting requirements that many patients and clinicians cite as a deterrent for daily, long-term use.

Eli Lilly is betting that convenience will determine the oral obesity market’s eventual winner. Its oral candidate, orforglipron, is a small-molecule GLP-1 receptor agonist rather than a peptide. According to Lilly, orforglipron can be taken any time of day without restrictions on food and water intake. From a patient behavior standpoint, that difference is substantial: no morning fasting ritual, no 30-minute wait before coffee.

Goldman Sachs projects that oral GLP-1s will generate roughly $22 billion in annual sales by 2030, capturing about 24% of the global weight-loss drug market, which they expect to be worth $95 billion. Within that segment, the bank expects Eli Lilly’s pill to have a 60% share, or roughly $13.6 billion, of the daily oral segment. Novo Nordisk’s oral semaglutide is projected to capture about 21%, or around $4 billion.
Efficacy vs. convenience

The projections reflect more than dosing convenience. In the Phase 3 ATTAIN-1 trial, orforglipron 36 mg reduced weight by an average of 12.4% (27.3 lbs) compared to 0.9% with placebo at 72 weeks. Some 59.6% of participants taking the highest dose lost at least 10% of their body weight, while 39.6% lost at least 15%.

That’s below Wegovy pill’s 16.6% in OASIS 4, but orforglipron also demonstrated significant improvements across key cardiometabolic risk factors, and the convenience advantage may outweigh the efficacy gap for many patients and payers.

None of this diminishes Novo’s achievement. Being first confers real advantages: physician familiarity, payer relationships and manufacturing scale already in place. Oral obesity therapy also lowers the threshold for primary care prescribing, potentially accelerating diagnosis and treatment earlier in the disease course.

And Visible Alpha consensus estimates project Rybelsus reaching $7.4 billion by 2030, suggesting the diabetes market still values oral options despite the constraints.

Still, the obesity market is unusually sensitive to everyday usability. Persistence varies by dataset and cohort; one analysis found 63% of commercially insured patients who started in early 2024 stayed on Wegovy or Zepbound after a year, though older cohorts showed lower retention. Cost is the reason most often cited for discontinuing use, but adherence friction compounds that problem.

These drugs are not taken in acute settings but folded into daily routines alongside meals, work schedules and other medications. Small frictions compound over time, affecting adherence, persistence and ultimately outcomes.
The road ahead

If injectables proved that GLP-1s work, oral therapies will determine how widely they are used. Goldman analysts expect the remaining 19% of the oral market to go to emerging pills from Viking Therapeutics, Structure Therapeutics, AstraZeneca, Roche and Pfizer, all developing their own oral candidates.

In that crowded race, the difference between “take anytime” and “take on an empty stomach and wait” may be the difference between market leadership and also-ran status.

The apartment features a dishwasher, and the building has laundry facilities. It’s conveniently located near the G, J, Z, and M trains, LIRR (Atlantic Terminal), gyms (Equinox, Blink), supermarkets, pharmacies, and plenty of great restaurants.

Move-in date: January 31, 2026

The apartment is located in the back of the building on the first floor, making it easily accessible (no stairs) and very quiet. The room comes unfurnished and comfortably fits a full or queen bed, plus an additional piece of furniture of your choice. While storage space in the apartment is limited, I’m open to finding creative solutions to make the space functional, comfortable, and well furnished.

About me: I’m a Virgo — fun, social, and organized — and I work in corporate healthcare, mostly in the office or just work-from-home or coffee shop. I live an active lifestyle during the week (work, gym) and really value coming home to a calm, peaceful space. On weekends, I enjoy going out, traveling, or just staying in to recharge.
I appreciate cleanliness and order (nothing obsessive — just the basics: clean up after yourself and keep shared spaces tidy), and I’m very mindful when it comes to shared spaces, schedules, and overall coexistence. I enjoy spending time with friends but don’t host parties at home — think pre-games, dinners, or short hangouts instead. My interests include fashion, interior design, music, good parties and DJs, great food, movies, museums, being outdoors, and traveling as much as possible.

What I’m looking for: Only gay/queer/trans people. Someone responsible, friendly, and communicative, with good energy and a community-oriented mindset. Being proactive about cleanliness and shared spaces is important, as well as having a lifestyle that’s active outside the apartment (not working from home). Someone who values having a quiet, non-smoking home (420 friendly) to return to at the end of the day, while also being open to building a friendly dynamic — enjoying dinners or short hangouts occasionally. This is not an apartment for parties, but rather a calm, comfortable home. Financial responsibility and consistency with rent and shared expenses are essential, as I value punctuality, transparency, and mutual respect.

Move-in requirements:
- $1,770 monthly rent (gas included — electricity and internet split 50/50)
- $1,770 security deposit
- Credit check / acceptable credit score
- Proof of income (bank statements and recent pay stubs)

The apartment features a dishwasher, and the building has laundry facilities. It’s conveniently located near the G, J, Z, and M trains, LIRR (Atlantic Terminal), gyms (Equinox, Blink), supermarkets, pharmacies, and plenty of great restaurants.

Move-in date: January 31, 2026

The apartment is located in the back of the building on the first floor, making it easily accessible (no stairs) and very quiet. The room comes unfurnished and comfortably fits a full or queen bed, plus an additional piece of furniture of your choice. While storage space in the apartment is limited, I’m open to finding creative solutions to make the space functional, comfortable, and well furnished.

About me: I’m a Virgo — fun, social, and organized — and I work in corporate healthcare, mostly in the office or just work-from-home or coffee shop. I live an active lifestyle during the week (work, gym) and really value coming home to a calm, peaceful space. On weekends, I enjoy going out, traveling, or just staying in to recharge.
I appreciate cleanliness and order (nothing obsessive — just the basics: clean up after yourself and keep shared spaces tidy), and I’m very mindful when it comes to shared spaces, schedules, and overall coexistence. I enjoy spending time with friends but don’t host parties at home — think pre-games, dinners, or short hangouts instead. My interests include fashion, interior design, music, good parties and DJs, great food, movies, museums, being outdoors, and traveling as much as possible.

What I’m looking for: Only gay/queer/trans people. Someone responsible, friendly, and communicative, with good energy and a community-oriented mindset. Being proactive about cleanliness and shared spaces is important, as well as having a lifestyle that’s active outside the apartment (not working from home). Someone who values having a quiet, non-smoking home (420 friendly) to return to at the end of the day, while also being open to building a friendly dynamic — enjoying dinners or short hangouts occasionally. This is not an apartment for parties, but rather a calm, comfortable home. Financial responsibility and consistency with rent and shared expenses are essential, as I value punctuality, transparency, and mutual respect.

Move-in requirements:
- $1,770 monthly rent (gas included — electricity and internet split 50/50)
- $1,770 security deposit
- Credit check / acceptable credit score

So long long story short I got sick randomly one day 6 years ago and it’s been a downward spiral since. Mostly GI related, chronic constipation ( can’t pass stool), trapped gas, and nausea! Then I started having complete muscle wasting where I loss all muscle mass and strength. I was alway in shape, exercise and sports (people see me now and always ask “wtf happened to you” 🤦‍♂️ it breaks me). Complete fatigue and loss of appetite followed and all these symptoms are still here and present to this day. I can’t travel, go out, have fun, ruin multiple relationships.  

I have done every supplement and test, sibo/mri/ CT scan/ gastric emptying/pelvic floor etc……You name it I have done it trust me. I’ve done every prescription med for constipation as well. Magnesium of any kind hasn’t worked. I did move into a new apartment, and a few months after moving in all these symptoms started. Apartment was littered with mold so mold could have started all this. I have moved out finally with very little relief. 

I stumble across coffee enemas a while back and now I’m at wits end with my constipation and motilty and want to give it a try. I understand all the claims and benefits with the liver and glutathione production but I wondering if anyone here has done coffee enemas? What’s your experience? Did they help with constipation?

1q4wwng,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExecutiveAssistants/comments/1q4wwng/execs_performance_reflecting_poorly_on_me_and_now/,Exec’s performance reflecting poorly on me - and now it’s personal,"I think this is mostly a rant, because I’ve tried many things to fix it, but if you have ideas or advice I’m open to it.

I am on a team of 3 EAs who report to a Chief of Staff. I support a few lower level leaders - associate vice presidents, mostly - and their programs, but my main job is to support one of the VPs. The other two EAs support 2 VPs but no programs. It comes out to be about similar workload, with our compensation differences being generally aligned with our responsibilities (until more recently, at least). 

When I was hired over 3 years ago, the VP I supported was excellent. He had been in the role for a long time, had moved his way up through the ranks at our institution, and got along really well with our COS. Everything was groovy and I felt like it was a cohesive team. However, he retired two years ago, and his replacement was directly appointed by the president from an external source. I’ve been supporting new VP ever since. 

Here’s the problem: the VP and the COS do NOT get along. Not just on a personal level, but they don’t see eye to eye on almost anything work related. I will gently note that the VP’s performance hasn’t been up to par and he will likely not be reappointed, but it goes beyond that. The COS stopped doing check-in meetings with him and avoids doing any joint projects with him at this point. They have both separately threatened to quit, but the president has talked them out of it.

At first, I felt just like a middleman. I do my best to help facilitate conversations and align expectations for my work and my VP’s projects. That was frustrating enough. But now it feels personal. My COS stopped our check-ins, constantly reschedules meetings with me, is late or no shows my meetings, stopped delegating tasks that are well within my scope, reassigned some of my projects to another EA, and will exclude me from trips to the coffee shop or lunch. Most times, she takes way too long to address my questions (sometimes weeks and months) then will chastise me for not having more progress done. I’ve had a professional relationship with her for over a decade, and it used to be very positive. Nothing personal has happened between us that I’m aware of.

I’ve talked to her directly. I’ve given ideas on how I can be a better EA. I’ve asked for direct feedback from her. I’ve told her that the change in our relationship has affected my productivity and performance. And she completely denies it. She insists that I’m doing everything I can and that my performance is great. When I get a rare opportunity to have an actual face to face with her, she acts like it’s all normal. But I really am at my wits end feeling like my boss’s attitude toward my VP is rubbing off on our professional and personal relationships.

It’s not just me, either. One of the other EAs supports a VP that didn’t see eye to eye with the COS. It got so bad that the VP recently left the institution. The EA is in a similar boat as me, with her 1:1s being canceled and projects being put at the bottom of the priority list, too. We’ve taken turns getting the brunt of it depending on where we are in the project cycle. Neither of us received a raise this year beyond the institution’s 1.5%, meanwhile the other EA got a 15% raise. 

It feels silly but the thing that’s bugging me most right now is holiday gifts. My brain knows not to expect anything from anyone, and not to gift up, but I can’t help it. I kept it small, making a homemade gift for the EA team, COS, my VP, and a couple other close colleagues. They cost less than $10 each, and I had fun making them. Did it hurt that my COS only gave the favored EA a gift? Of course. But what hurts worse is I didn’t even get a thank you for the gift I gave.

okay so i've been obsessed with this lately. not in a creepy way, but like, genuinely curious about why some people are SO good at getting others to open up. you know those conversations where you suddenly realize you've been talking for 30 minutes straight and shared things you never planned to? yeah, that.

i went down a rabbit hole of FBI interrogation techniques, podcasts with hostage negotiators, books on influence, and social psychology research. turns out there's actual science behind this, and it's not manipulation, it's about creating psychological safety and strategic listening. here's what actually works.

**the tactical pause is INSANE**

most people can't handle silence. we're hardwired to fill conversational gaps. FBI negotiators use this constantly. when someone finishes talking, instead of immediately responding, wait 3-5 seconds. just sit there. maintain eye contact. don't nod, don't ""mhmm,"" just... wait.

what happens? people think they haven't fully explained themselves. they'll add more context, more details, more truth. Chris Voss talks about this in ""Never Split the Difference: Negotiating As If Your Life Depended On It"". this book is genuinely wild, Voss was the FBI's lead international kidnapping negotiator for years. reading it felt like getting a masterclass in human behavior. the tactical empathy techniques alone changed how i approach every difficult conversation. he breaks down exactly how to get people comfortable enough to reveal what they're actually thinking. insanely practical, zero fluff.

the pause works because our brains interpret silence as ""they're waiting for more"" or ""maybe i wasn't clear enough."" try it at your next coffee chat. it feels awkward at first but the results are ridiculous.

**mirroring their last 3 words makes them elaborate automatically**

this one sounds too simple to work but it's basically psychological magic. when someone says something, repeat the last 2-3 words they said as a question. that's it.

them: ""i've been really stressed about work lately""
you: ""stressed about work?""
them: proceeds to unload everything

Voss calls this ""mirroring"" and says it's one of the most effective tools in his arsenal. it signals you're listening without imposing your own interpretation. people naturally want to clarify and expand. you're basically giving them permission to keep going without steering the conversation.

i started using this everywhere and people regularly tell me ""wow you're such a good listener."" i'm literally just repeating their words back.

**label their emotions out loud**

this one's from hostage negotiation but works in normal life. when you sense someone's feeling something, say it. not as a question, as a statement.

""it seems like you're frustrated about that""
""sounds like that was really disappointing""
""it feels like you're worried about how this will play out""

""The Like Switch: An Ex-FBI Agent's Guide to Influencing, Attracting, and Winning People Over"" by Jack Schafer explains the neuroscience here. Schafer spent 20 years developing strategies for recruiting spies, which is basically getting people to trust you enough to commit treason. the book is PACKED with techniques on building rapport fast. when you label someone's emotion accurately, it activates their brain's reward centers. they feel seen. and when people feel seen, they open up.

**ask ""what"" and ""how"" instead of ""why""**

""why"" questions make people defensive. they trigger justification mode. our brains interpret ""why did you do that?"" as subtle accusation.

swap it:
instead of ""why did you feel that way?"" goes to ""what made you feel that way?""
instead of ""why didn't that work?"" goes to ""how did that play out?""

same information, zero defensiveness. people elaborate way more when they don't feel like they're being interrogated.

**the ""i bet"" technique is stupidly effective**

when you want someone to disagree and share more, use ""i bet."" it's called accusation audit.

""i bet you're thinking this is pointless""
""i bet this sounds annoying""

people will usually correct you and explain what they're ACTUALLY thinking. Voss uses this to preempt objections. you're giving them an easy opening to share their real perspective without confrontation.

**strategic self disclosure creates reciprocity**

this comes up in ""The Fine Art of Small Talk"" by Debra Fine. if you want someone to open up about something personal, share something slightly vulnerable first. not trauma dumping, just genuine.

the reciprocity principle kicks in. they'll usually match or exceed your level of openness. Fine's book is underrated honestly, it's practical AF for people who find conversations exhausting. she breaks down exactly how to navigate different social situations without feeling fake.

there's also solid research on this from Arthur Aron's work on interpersonal closeness. he found that mutual vulnerability accelerates intimacy faster than anything else.

**eliminate the word ""but"" from feedback**

""you did great, but..."" immediately erases everything before it. people stop listening, they're just waiting for criticism.

swap it with ""and"":
""you did great, and here's what could make it even better""

same feedback, totally different reception. people stay open instead of getting defensive.

Plus you can customize the voice and tone, choosing anything from a calm, soothing narrator to a sarcastic or energetic style depending on your mood. Makes learning feel way more engaging when you're commuting or doing chores.

**the power of ""tell me more about that""**

literally just this phrase. when someone mentions anything, respond with genuine curiosity: ""tell me more about that.""

it's open ended. it doesn't impose direction. it signals interest without judgment. people will talk for DAYS if you keep asking this.

**validate before you offer solutions**

this is huge and most people get it backwards. when someone shares a problem, our instinct is to immediately solve it. resist that.

first: validate
""that sounds incredibly frustrating""
""i can see why that's been weighing on you""

THEN: ask if they want input
""do you want to brainstorm solutions or just vent?""

people don't open up when they feel like you're rushing to fix them. they open up when they feel heard first.

**mimic their communication style**

if they text in long paragraphs, match that. if they're brief, be brief. if they're formal, match the tone.

people trust people who feel similar to them. it's subconscious but powerful. charisma research shows we're drawn to people who mirror our energy and communication patterns.

**the thing is**, none of this is manipulation if your intention is genuine connection. these techniques work because they create safety, show respect, and signal authentic interest. we're just optimizing for what humans naturally respond to.

people talk more when they feel heard, not judged, and given space to think. most conversations fail because we're so focused on what we'll say next that we miss the cues telling us to just shut up and listen.

1q4wq8l,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1q4wq8l/can_anyone_offer_some_advice_please_grinder/,Can anyone offer some advice please & grinder blocking [DF54 grinder],"Hi, 

A couple of weeks ago my amazon burr grinder died and I decided I would up my game. 

I bought myself the df54, I found a seller on eBay for a brand new one, Cotswold coffee I think.

I have a sage Bambino plus, I buy freshly medium roasted beans in Northampton, UK every couple of weeks and I make 22 g double shots with an open basket.

I start the grinder up and drop the beans in, put the lid back on and wait for it to grind, I had it set at 15 because that's where people recommended it to start with and actually it was perfect there. 

Just over 2 weeks in and now suddenly the grinder has started getting blocked up, completely with ground coffee causing the machine to stop. I then have to dig out all of the grinds and scrape it off the kitchen side. It happened for the first time on Saturday and it happened again this morning.

Has has anyone else experienced anything similar? I used the plunger when it gets towards the end, every time and it blows out the grounds, suddenly though it's getting fully blocked up and I really don't understand why. 

Can anyone offer any advice please?

It's quite frustrating considering the grinder was £219! 

Thank you for any comments.

I'll need to sit you down this evening and tell you some things that will break your heart. I'm not excited about that, but it has to be done, and the time is now because there is no more fight left in me.

I'm going to tell you that I love you but that I'm not in love with you. I'll need to explain that it's been that way for a number of years... half of the time of our relationship, to be exact. I'll need to tell you that these past 9 years or so have been fueled purely by loyalty to a person, honor for memories made, life experiences, and what we've meant to each other at different phases of our lives, and a sense of desire for what a committed relationship should be. I love you as my friend is what I'll say, then, I'll need to tell you that that love is running dry.

I'll sit across from you with a cluttered coffee table between us and tell you that I am tired of giving up caring about things that matter to me for your comfort. I'll tell you that I've bottled a lot of this up for one reason or another and that is my fault. I need to start with our dead bedroom. I have to tell you that I couldn't bring myself to tell you exactly what I was seeing because there's no way you'd hear it and that I didn't think you would do anything about it. ""Honey, you have body issues and intimacy issues that you only overcome through alcohol and that isn't healthy"" wouldn't go over well with you in your early 30's. When I tell you that you only wanted to engage sexually after you had been drinking and that you spent years turning your back to be when you changed led me to believe there were two issues causing this problem you will roll your eyes at me, just like if I would have tried to tell you that over 10 years ago. I'll then tell you that I gave up on trying to initiate anything because you would reject me if you were sober and that it took a lot for me to realize that the problem was yours and it wasn't me. Each time you wanted to have annual drunk sex on vacation was a cut. I'll tell you that I needed to ""give up, and move on"" from the idea of having sex. I'll tell you about that very specific cut from when you had to go to the ER with kidney stones and when the doctor asked about the last time you had sex so they could rule out a UTI. When you told them it had been over a year, which led them to ask who I was to be in the room with you, you simply referred to me as a friend. That wasn't the cut. The cut was that the doctor stated that I ""must be a really good friend"". I'll let you know I chose to stay with you knowing that I no longer viewed you romantically or intimately as a form of self-protection. I'll tell you how painful the cut was that the night before your bilateral mastectomy when you asked me to take photos of you and that it was the most I had ever freely seen your breasts while you were sober was another cut. I'll have to assure you that these feelings happened way before the cancer and that your health is not the issue and never was. Hearing friends talk about their sex lives or seeing intimate scenes on TV was a cut. You needing to get so drunk you had to leave your car on the other side of the city and have a friend drive you home only for you to fall down our front steps and break multiple facial bones was a cut. At least you stopped drinking for a year and rarely drink today because of that event, it's just too bad you had to be 41 to do it. I am, however, going to tell you I'm proud of you for that.

I'll tell you that years of cleaning up after you, begging you to be more active with chores, constantly hoping that you'd improve, and even giving you the option of choosing your chores just wore me down. I didn't have time and energy to convince you to help and to do all of the chores after you made it clear you wouldn't help. Each time I had a blow up about it and then you would say ""just tell me what to do"" meant I had to remind you that I'm not your mother, I'm your partner was another cut. Watching you attempt to say you were sorry by doing a few chores once, but never consistently, was a cut. I'll tell you that what I wanted to a consistent, sustained effort and all you gave me was scraps. I'll tell you that I grew resentful of you napping or sitting on your phone while I shopped, cooked, cleaned, did laundry, fixed things around the house, kept up with vehicle and yard maintenance, and managed nearly everything else. I'll tell you that that cycle of behavior was a turn off and the resentment of it all made me lose attraction for you. I'll tell you how when I'm cooking dinner or prepping lunches for the week and you come into the kitchen and say ""you don't have to do that for me"" is a far cry from ""here, let me take a turn doing that"". I'll tell you that each time you told me ""I didn't know you wanted me to"" after having made it clear in our previous conversations and when you could have very well imagined how much I would have appreciated it was a deep cut.

I'll bring up that it took nearly 6 months of reminders to get you to actually shut the lid on the creamer bottle so it doesn't leak in the fridge was so dumb. I think you were 40 when we did this. I didn't have this on my adult relationship bingo card and by the time you finally figured it out and committed to it, I didn't think I had the energy to do this again with anything else until you started leaving things around the house for me to put away for you. The bleach wipe from the rental car that you put on the tv stand for 6 months with the intent it would be nice to have in one of our cars ""just in case"". The pliers you took from the toolbox that set next to the dishrack for 8 months. The package boxes piled at the top of the stairs that would only take a minute to bring to the garage but need to sit there for a week first. All of these were cuts because they all had to come with way too many reminders and way too much expectation that I should just be a little more patient and not that you should pay more attention to detail.

I need to tell you about the time I had the flu and spent the whole morning in the bathroom while you were at work. I'll tell you how deep the cut was when you knew how sick I was and when came home and saw me on the couch your first reaction was to make sure I wasn't using your pillow (I was using mine and moved yours to keep it germ free) before walking up the stairs. No offer to get me anything, no checking in on me, no concern for how dehydrated and exhausted I was (took a week to recover) other than making sure I wasn't getting my germs on your very washable pillow case.

There are certain ""behind the scenes"" things I started doing consistently for you that I never wanted to make a big deal out of. I was proud of myself that you never had to ask me to fill the plant watering jugs out of the rain barrel or that at the end of the season I would fill up the large holding containers for watering the house plants in winter and would be sure to top off the smaller jugs monthly so that you never needed to worry about that part of the process. When I gather the bath towels and other laundry, I'm always sure to replace the washcloths you leave in the shower with clean ones so when you take your next shower, you have everything you need right there. I ""didn't know"" you wanted me to do these things. Yet, somehow, I could imagine how much you'd appreciate them and I made YOU my reason for doing those things proactively rather than have you ask me to do these things over and over. This will lead into me telling you how deep the cut was when you told me ""I better remember this"" when it meant you would need to wake up 15-20 minutes earlier to walk the dog one morning before work. I'll tell you how rude that was, just like I told you then. But, this time, I'll explain the irony of how the thing you wanted me to ""pay you back"" has never been an issue in our history and that if anyone had a reason to say something so rude to their partner, it would be me saying it to you. This one cut me very deeply.

At this point, you'll likely be crying and shutting down. I'm going to keep going though because you need to know that I think you lack self-regulation skills that would have prevented it from getting to this point. I'll bring up your alarm clocks... the many alarms you need to wake you up each morning and are only about 60-70% effective. You're so tired of hearing me tell you that if you set an alarm that you don't intend to wake up for, you are only training yourself to ignore every alarm. I'll tell you how tired I am of you being late to work multiple times a week. Because I work with low-capacity adults in the workforce development field and see changes and positive results in 6 months to a year, not having these messages resonate with you after close to 20 years is a cut each time you mismanage your time. I'll need to remind you of how you overslept a morning this past summer when we had made plans for a big day. I'll remind you that you walked down the stairs and sadly stated ""I did it again"" showing you were conscious of your actions and that this was an ongoing thing. Because that happened again this weekend, that was likely the 1,000th cut.

I'll let you know that about 100 or so other cuts come from a combination of your lack of self-regulation and time management. I'm going to ask you if you could look your mom or your sister dead in the eyes and tell them that you have 5 alarms set on your phone starting an over an hour from when you need to be at work but you don't wake up until within a half hour. I want to know if you'll feel any shame when you tell them that the reason you don't come back upstairs to kiss me goodbye when you are on 1st shift is that you don't have enough time. What will your reaction be when they ask you why you didn't make time?

I need you to hear that I am tired of carrying the emotional labor burden. Each time a situation necessitated a conversation about something that was bordering on a cut and that was within your control, you had the expectation that I should do work to manage my feelings about your actions and behaviors and that the burden should not be on you to change those actions or behaviors. I've told you this before so I need you to know how deep these cuts are when you try to tell me ""you didn't know"". Each eye roll you gave me then was a cut. Taking 10 minutes to reframe the issue so that you could see it from my perspective if the roles were changed only to have you re-offend again and again was an even deeper cut.

I think this is when I mention that these things are a lack of maturity on your part. I'll mention that when adults get accepted into the workforce development program that I run, not everyone is ready for the opportunity. The number 1 issue for lack of readiness is a lack of maturity. In their case, maturity is time management, self-regulation, accountability, willingness to change habits, and the ability to be comfortable with being uncomfortable. I'll reiterate how far from perfect I am and that I am still growing and maturing every day. I need you to hear me tell you that the lack of maturity that you have is very similar to those I work with professionally. I'll tell you that my therapist was shocked to know how patient I have been with you given what I do professionally versus what you do consistently. It will be then that I tell you that I am not willing to grow old with someone who had refused to grow up with me.

48 hours ago I told you that I have no reason to want to make weekend plans in the future that include you because you are reliably unreliable and torpedo everything with your anxieties and selfishness. I told you was giving up on caring about that aspect of our life. This morning I told you that you were not welcome to the lunches in the fridge and that I didn't make them for you, they are only for me. I am no longer doing anything for you that you wouldn't do for me. I'll remind you that there was a time that I would have done anything for you regardless, but that was many, many cuts ago. Up until 48 hours ago, when you worked 2nd shift, I always, e-v-e-r-y goddamn day, came back upstairs to kiss you goodbye before I left for work. Those kisses are done... I'm not withholding them from you, they just don't exist anymore. They're gone.

I'm not in love with you, and I don't love you enough anymore to keep worrying about how you might struggle on your own. Your health, your income, the chaos that surrounds you - no longer my problem. I am saving just enough of my love for you to be kind to you while we separate. What people will say or think is something I no longer care about or am afraid of. I never wanted to leave someone who went through a serious health scare. I always viewed that sort of thing as an indication of weak character. The 1,000th cut got me over that hump, and I've never seen the situation so clearly as I do now.

The thing about the 1,000th cut is you never know what it will be. I'll need to tell you that it was a small, almost insignificant cut. What you need to understand is that that cut alone didn't break our relationship. I lost the ability to heal my cuts and could no longer keep up with them. I'm going to look you in the eyes and tell you that I was literally planning on dying next to you in 45 years in a dead bedroom relationship just as long as you could keep replenishing my patience by growing up with me and becoming a more capable and stable adult as well as a reliable partner in shared duties. I was going to choose you for life but you chose excuses, selfishness, laziness, and complacency over me.

Tonight will be the last that I sleep on the couch. Tomorrow, you'll need to clear all of your unfolded clothes and random things from the guest room bed and move all of the things off of the floor and dressers into the main bedroom. Tomorrow night and on, the guest room will be my room. In a month we'll need to get lawyers and in 6 we'll need a real estate agent. I'm going to lose a good sum of money on this, giving you things you never paid a penny for in the first place. I'll expect you to try and keep the dog out of spite because you know he's bonded to me and not you. What I understand that you never will, is that change is only possible when the pain of remaining the same outweighs the pain of growth. I am in too much pain in this relationship that all of the shitty things to come will be totally worth it when I'm able to live the second half of my life with someone who doesn't need to be coached or shamed into keeping plans, helping around the house, or kissing me goodbye every day. I'm excited to find someone who does those things as their ""default"" so I can grow old with them.",2,1767644095.0,RelationshipsOver35,30,0.53,False
1q4wof0,https://www.reddit.com/r/MindDecoding/comments/1q4wof0/6_things_that_secretly_give_you_anxiety_but_no/,6 Things That Secretly Give You Anxiety (But No One Talks About Them),"Almost everyone deals with anxiety, but not everyone knows \*why\* it shows up when it does. It’s easy to blame it on stress, trauma, or burnout, but the truth is, a lot of low-key habits and modern-day lifestyle choices are quietly feeding our anxiety daily without us realizing it.

This post isn’t about preaching. It’s meant to unpack some sneaky anxiety triggers backed by legit research, stuff you won’t catch from a 12-second TikTok by some influencer with zero actual knowledge. All the insights here are pulled from verified sources like \*The Huberman Lab Podcast\*, \*The Journal of Anxiety Disorders\*, and behavioral science research from Harvard and Stanford.

If you’ve been feeling anxious but can’t figure out why, here are 6 overlooked triggers that might be messing with you—and what to do instead.

**Caffeine… especially on an empty stomach**

Andrew Huberman (neurobiologist at Stanford)\* breaks this down beautifully. In one of his episodes, he explains how caffeine reduces adenosine (the chemical that makes you feel sleepy), which is great for alertness—but also triggers your body’s stress response.

Drinking coffee first thing without food? That’s like pouring gasoline on a nervous system already dealing with cortisol spikes from waking up.

In a 2022 study from \*Nutrients Journal\*, researchers found that high caffeine intake significantly increases anxiety symptoms, especially in sensitive individuals.

Fix:\* Try drinking it 90 minutes after waking and eat something first. Even a banana helps slow the cortisol peak.

**Not enough morning sunlight**

Light is medicine for your brain. A lack of sunlight disrupts your circadian rhythm and messes with your dopamine and serotonin—two essential chemicals for regulating mood and stress.

A 2020 paper in \*Frontiers in Psychology\* noted that people who get less than 30 minutes of morning light had significantly higher anxiety scores.

Morning light tells your brain it’s time to wake up, which sets the tone for cortisol balance for the entire day.

Fix:\* Get outside within 30 minutes of waking up. You don’t need direct sun—just daylight on your skin and eyes for 10 minutes helps a ton.

**Too much scrolling, not enough social**

There’s a difference between passive consumption (doomscrolling) and active connection (FaceTiming a close friend).

The \*American Journal of Preventive Medicine\* found in their study of 1,787 adults that individuals with high social media use were 2.7 times more likely to suffer from anxiety and depression.

**The problem isn’t the phone; it’s how we use it**

\* \*Fix:\* Limit passive apps (like IG and TikTok) to 30 minutes a day. Use that time to call a friend or do something IRL with someone. Quality over quantity.

**Always needing a Plan B**

Sounds smart in theory, right? But living in constant backup-mode trains your brain to expect failure before anything even goes wrong.

Harvard psychologist Dr. Daniel Gilbert has studied how ""impact bias"" makes us overestimate how bad things will feel if they go wrong—so we pre-plan our disappointment and unknowingly keep ourselves in a low-level threat state.

Fix:\* Make the plan. Commit. Don’t always prep for disaster. Training yourself to sit with uncertainty builds actual resilience.

**Perfectionism disguised as productivity**

People love to wear “I’m a perfectionist” like a badge, but psychological research shows that perfectionism is highly correlated with chronic anxiety.

According to a meta-analysis in \*the Journal of Clinical Psychology\*, perfectionistic tendencies, especially the fear of making mistakes, drive heightened anxiety responses, procrastination, and burnout.

Fix:\* Try the 90% rule from Greg McKeown’s \*Effortless\*: if something feels 90% good enough, ship it. Let “done” be better than “perfect.”

**Low blood sugar crashes (aka ‘hangxiety’) are real**

Skipping meals or eating only sugar/carbs causes blood glucose levels to spike fast, then crash; that crash often feels \*exactly\* like anxiety: shakiness, irritability, and racing thoughts.

A 2021 review in \*Harvard Health\* linked blood sugar instability with increased anxiety and panic symptoms.

Fix: Balance your plate. Add protein to every meal. Don’t go more than 4–5 hours without food. Think eggs, Greek yogurt, nuts, tofu, or protein shakes.

These things may seem small, but they add up. Anxiety isn’t always about what’s happening around you—it’s often what’s happening \*inside\* your nervous system. The good news? These are all learnable adjustments, not personality flaws.
