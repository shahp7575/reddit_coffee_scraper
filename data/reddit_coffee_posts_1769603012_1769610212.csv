Next, I purchased a bird feeder with a camera, then a second one, then a third, and next came the bird box with a camera.

A friend gifted me a birding book for our area, and I can now quite confidently name all of our regular visitors.  

Then I started purchasing every seed that any bird could potentially like. For christmas, i asked my husband for seeds and made sure they had food during negative temperatures and snow storms. 

I've now purchased a camera and want to get into bird watching and photography as a hobby. 

Any tips? When taking birding notes, what sort of notes do you take? Im not especially graceful. How do you approach them to get close-up pictures?

1qpclka,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1qpclka/what_am_i_doing_wrong_breville_bambino_plus/,What am I doing wrong? [breville bambino plus & breville smart pro grinder],"Finally after 3 years I upgraded from a $30 delonghi from Sam’s Club that I got for free. I bought the Breville Bambino Plus & the Breville Smart Pro Grinder, which came with 2 free bags of Olympia Coffee Big Truck beans.

Before the grinder & beans arrived I was using 18g of Illy Classico ground coffee, the drip was perfect.

I have almost finished the first bag of beans trying to dial it in and I’m at the point where I may return the grinder and just stick with Illy because it works.

I keep getting slow drips, then one side of the portafilter will finally start to dispense but it’s definitely over extracted. This is what I’ve tried:

\-weigh 18g of beans, grind size 12 for 18s (2 shots)

\-18g, grind size 14

\-17g, grind size 12

\-17g, grind size 14

\-18g, grind size 20

\-17g, grind size 20

\-18g, grind size 8 (just to see, I realize you need a coarser grind for under extraction)

I’ve been sticking to the Espresso range setting on the grinder which is 20-11. Everywhere I’ve read online people with this grinder have theirs set lower than 11, I know it varies by beans but I feel like I’m doing something wrong if I need to grind courser than a 20?

I always use a distributor and good tamp, then use the shaving tool to make sure I didn’t overfill.

I was using the double wall filter for the Illy and switched to the single wall since they are beans roasted on 1/16 (that’s what the user guide suggested.)",1,1769609962.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

I thought about cleaning it (soap and then acetone?), sanding it with \~P300 wet sandpaper, and then forcing a new patina (coffee? Mustard? Other ideas?). Is that the way you would go? Any suggestions? Really any input is much appreciated!

I am looking for some support with a family member who is currently under the care of their mother. She has guardianship (welfare and finance) over them. I will be keeping some information anonymous to protect identities. The person in question is 30+ years old and has learning disabilities, autism and a life-long progressive mobility condition. 

  
They receive support from their Locality team. This entails 2 x outings a week that last no more than 3 hours. I believe they are entitled to, and have been offered more groups etc, but this has been declined by their mother on more than one occasion. 

  
Despite numerous attempts to support them, their mother has yet to arrange a medication review and a full health check. This has not been done in over 4 years to my knowledge, despite WHO guidelines for those with learning disabilities to receive this every 6 months.

  
Their mother works full time, as does their partner, and with the other adult children no longer at home, they are home alone for \~6 hours a day. This concerns me because they have known issues with their swallowing (are on a softened diet), and also act on impulsiveness (think drinking 5+ cups off coffee) because no one is there to monitor them.

  
I have raised my concerns with their mother, who appears to listen to what is being said, but doesn't act on anything. I'm looking for support on the next steps, as well as more insight into the repercussions for their mother if they do not reach out for further support, and get the vulnerable person the required check ups etc.

1qpcciq,https://i.redd.it/nrnjm0s1l3gg1.png,Panera vs Starbucks - Which is better for working on your laptop?,"Working on your laptop as a freelancer in **Starbucks vs Panera** can feel like two very different workdays, even though you’re technically doing the same thing: sipping coffee, using the Wi-Fi, and trying to get real work done.

Starbucks often has a fast, energetic vibe. There’s music playing, drinks constantly being called out, and people coming and going all the time. For some freelancers, that background noise actually helps with focus. It feels busy, motivating, and you don’t feel out of place camping out with a laptop. The downside is that it can get loud, seats can be hard to find, and power outlets aren’t always guaranteed.

Panera usually offers a calmer, more relaxed environment. The seating is often more spacious, tables are larger, and it’s easier to settle in for a longer session. Many freelancers like Panera for writing, meetings, or deep work because the noise level is lower and the atmosphere feels less rushed. On the flip side, some locations discourage long stays during peak hours, and the vibe can feel less energetic.

Both spots have their pros and cons, and a lot depends on the location, time of day, and your work style.

First off, a massive thank you for the feedback on the **AIO.TVFLIX Web Builder**. The response has been crazy, and because of all the feature requests and updates, I’ve decided to create a dedicated subreddit to keep things organized.

If you are using the tool or want to see the latest dev notes, please join via the link at the bottom.

# Major V2 Updates

For those who missed the last edit, I’ve pushed some significant updates to the builder based on your feedback:

* **Debridio Support Added:** You can now integrate Debridio directly into the stream list.
* **Non-Debrid Optimization:** If you aren't using a Debrid service, the builder now intelligently switches the formatter to show **Seeders (👥)** instead of cache status and disables complex group fetching to prevent timeouts.
* **Full Catalog Manager:** You can now toggle specific providers (Netflix, Disney+, Anime, etc.) on/off for both the Home Screen and Discovery page, and reorder them to your liking.
* **Language Fixes:** Fixed the logic for non-English audio. If you select a foreign language, it now correctly prioritizes it in the stream list.

# New Support Options

I’ve had a lot of requests for help from users who aren't comfortable managing API keys or who want better performance. I’ve added a couple of new options to my coffee page:

* **Private AIO Server:** Access to a private instance for better reliability.
* **Done-For-You Setup:** I can now set up the entire configuration for you if you don't want to deal with the technical side.

I’ve recently started getting into tea, because I like having a hot drink that isn’t sweet and isn’t coffee. I like trying new things and want to have a variety of teas that I know I like. The problem is that I don’t like the taste of camellia sinensis (ironic, i know). I haven’t tried very many teas that I’ve liked, but so far i’ve been a fan of earl grey, the republic of tea’s blackberry sage, and something a friend’s mom offered me which had a strong açaí berry taste (I described it as tasting like cleaning solution but in a good way). Bonus points for anything that’s caffeine free, or very low caffeine! I prefer to avoid it entirely if I can.

I’ve also enjoyed arnold palmers (especially made with green tea instead of black tea) and the super sweet fruit tea drinks you get at boba shops (not boba though, i dont like milk), but I imagine those are generally considered a different beast.",1,1769608159.0,tea,1,1.0,False

So let’s do this!



Part 1: Methods



Here I will list EVERY method I can think of to process unprocessed emotion / heal:

1. Act on what your unprocessed emotions want you to do (Obviously don’t do anything stupid.)
2. Shake
3. Breath work
4. Cold exposure
5. Exercise
6. Cry
7. Scream
8. Get angry / loud
9. Rewrite the trauma story in your mind to be good
10. Etc



Part 2: Implement



Out of all those methods I showed you and of course there is more, I would argue the best one is were you just act on what your unprocessed emotions tell you, but disclaimer alert obviously don’t act on doing anything stupid or illegal lol, of that is what it tells you to do, only healthy stuff, okay?



And another thing I will say, do most of these healing methods in your own private space, and as a bonus of you have got this far in your healing journey were you now know how to bring up unprocessed emotion / things of that nature, now what I recommend is someone you can open up to about things like this.



You just need to find a person who you feel comfortable to open up to with this stuff, and be careful who you choose, this will be very helpful.



Part 3: FAQ



“How long should I do the whole processing emotion part for?”



Honestly it depends, I say as a good rule of thumb just do the healing work until you feel like some sort of emotion is done processing, there is really no right or wrong way to do this.



“Does this actually work?”



Yes, legit all trauma is, is unprocessed emotion, and of you bring up your unprocessed emotion, then do one of the healing methods listed, and feel some emotion leaving you, that is fantastic, that is -1 incident of trauma and that equal to you being like 1% better in all areas of life, cause it regulates your nervous system.



“Is this safe?”



Of course and as a disclaimer alert, someone once told me it is dangerous advice to tell people with trauma to act on their unprocessed emotions, and of course do not do anything dangerous or hurt others or anything like that but of for example you are at the gym and you bring up a trauma of bullying, then you go hard on the boxing bag, that is a good and healthy way to process this emotion / trauma out of you.



Part 4: What to do next



Of you have made it this far well done you, you are well on your way to your happiest self, regulating your nervous system, becoming the best version of you and etc.



What I say to do next honestly, of you just make this a daily habit you constantly do, and you always have the mindset now when you go through painful moments in the future in your life like break ups, friend ship loss and etc, always make sure you process it and just make it a daily habit to try and process at least one incident of trauma daily, make it a habit.



I really recommend is that you make this habit like brushing your teeth, of you have not already I highly suggest you make a habit tracker.



And you can do that by ideally using a real piece of paper putting the month & year at the top, then numbering the days of the month, and then you write the habit name acronyms at the top like healing trauma (HT) and so on, this is also great for any other habit you want to get consistent in, then what you do is draw boxes for everyday of the month for the habit and other habits, then simply of you do the habit you get a tick, of not you get an X.



Then simply do this every month for ever, just tape it up to your wall ideally some were you see very often, and voila, you can also of course do it digitally as well but I really think physical is way better.



And yeah guy’s that is how you can stay accountable to this habit of HT (healing trauma,) and legit just simply just pick a time of the day / use the habit stack method to put your habit of healing trauma.



Personally I value my time a lot and I habit stack my HT habit when I do an existing habit which is cold showers, and that is also great cause cold exposure is excellent at processing your unprocessed emotion, but that’s a guide for another day.



So you do the same. And now I will just give you some general tips, things of that nature for how to stay more consistent and how your mindset should be to this habit / habit tracker.



1. Make it attractive, these tips I believe are actually from the book atomic habits, but anyways you should make your habit of HT / bringing up unprocessed emotion attractive, it should be something you get to do, not you have to do, maybe right before you do the habit you just do a quick visualisation practise of seeing yourself as the happiest most healed version of you, that could help, remember make it attractive.
2. Reward yourself after, personally what I have always done after my HT habit, I actually do some deep work in my schedule and I tick the habit off the box which gives me a good healthy dopamine hit, and I have a nice black coffee with some dark chocolate, this is important.
3. Make it effortless, you never want to feel like you have to do something, instead you want it to be like you get to do something, right? This means you must make your habit of bringing up unprocessed emotion as easy possible, do it the way you like it, what method do you prefer? Do that one, what environment do you enjoy doing it in?

1qpbt9q,https://www.reddit.com/r/immortalists/comments/1qpbt9q/a_simple_way_to_think_about_antiinflammatory/,A simple way to think about anti-inflammatory eating (without diet tribes),"A lot of people get confused by the term “anti-inflammatory diet”, but most approaches actually agree on the same foundations.

In practice, inflammation tends to go up when the diet is built around:

* Sugar and sweetened foods  
* Refined carbohydrates (white bread, pastries, etc.)  
* Fried and ultra-processed foods  
* Processed meats and packaged snacks  

And it tends to go down when meals are built around:

* Whole foods  
* Enough protein  
* Healthy fats (olive oil, nuts, fish, etc.)  
* Vegetables and fruits  

There isn’t really a single “magic” diet name here. Mediterranean, whole-food, anti-inflammatory… they all point in the same direction: eat real food, remove the obvious junk, keep things simple.

This guide explains the idea in more detail and also covers common questions like eggs, coffee, breakfast, and vitamins:[https://medium.com/](https://medium.com/@Digit_By_Oliva/anti-inflammatory-diet-what-to-eat-what-to-avoid-and-how-to-reduce-inflammation-naturally-e5495242a570)

1qpbsyi,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qpbsyi,Welcome to r/TVFlix! The Official Home for the AIO Stremio Builder,"Hey everyone!

If you are coming here from r/StremioAddons, welcome! The response to the **AIO.TVFLIX Builder** has been absolutely incredible. Because the project is growing so fast, I realized we needed a dedicated space to organize updates, handle support, and share cool configurations.

Welcome to r/TVFlix —the official hub for the All-In-One Stremio setup.

# What is the AIO.TVFLIX Builder?

For those new here, I created a web app that automates the complex configuration of Stremio. Instead of manually installing 10 different addons and hoping they work, this builder generates a ""Super-Build"" for you.

* **AIOStreams:** Merges Torrentio, Comet, MediaFusion, Debridio, and more into a **single, unified stream list**. It handles smart de-duplication, sorts by quality (Remux > WebDL), and uses a visual ""Star Rating"" system for streams.
* **AIOMetadata:** Replaces the messy default Stremio catalogs with curated rows for **Netflix, Disney+, HBO, Anime (by Studio/Season)**, and adds High-Res posters with ratings.

**Use the Web App here:** [aio.tvflix.co.uk](https://aio.tvflix.co.uk/)

**Check the GitHub:** [ParticularCatch449/aio-tvflix-builder](https://github.com/ParticularCatch449/aio-tvflix-builder)

# What is this Subreddit for?

I want this to be a community where we can make the perfect streaming setup together. Here is what you can expect to see posted here:

* **Support Requests:** Having trouble with API keys? Debrid not syncing? Post here.
* **Dev Notes:** I’ll post changelogs (like the recent V2 update with Audio Language fixes and Debridio support) here first.
* **Requests:** Want a specific feature added to the builder? Let me know.
* **New Releases:** Notifications when the builder gets a version upgrade.

# ☕ New Support Options (Private Server & Setup)

Many of you have asked for ways to support the project or get help if you aren't ""tech-savvy."" I’ve added some new options to my Buy Me a Coffee page:

1. **Private AIO Server:** Access to a private, high-performance instance for the addon.
2. **""Done-For-You"" Setup (with subscription):** If you don't want to deal with API keys or configuration, I can now personally set up your entire Stremio account and manage it for you.

*Note: The Builder is and always will be free to use! These are just optional extras for those who want to support the dev hours (and the AI prompting hours 😉).*

**☕ Support the Project:** [Buy Me a Coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/particular_catch_449)

# User Flairs

I’ve enabled User Flairs so we can see who is new and who is a pro. Please pick your flair on the sidebar!

* **Before Setup:** You’re just getting started.
* **Newly Setup:** You just ran the builder and you're testing it out.
* **Active User:** You’re up and running smoothly.

Thank you all for the feedback, the bug reports, and the kind words. Let’s build the ultimate Stremio experience!",4,1769608062.0,TVFlix,0,1.0,False

“How long should I do the whole processing emotion part for?”



Honestly it depends, I say as a good rule of thumb just do the healing work until you feel like some sort of emotion is done processing, there is really no right or wrong way to do this.



“Does this actually work?”



Yes, legit all trauma is, is unprocessed emotion, and of you bring up your unprocessed emotion, then do one of the healing methods listed, and feel some emotion leaving you, that is fantastic, that is -1 incident of trauma and that equal to you being like 1% better in all areas of life, cause it regulates your nervous system.

Of course and as a disclaimer alert, someone once told me it is dangerous advice to tell people with trauma to act on their unprocessed emotions, and of course do not do anything dangerous or hurt others or anything like that but of for example you are at the gym and you bring up a trauma of bullying, then you go hard on the boxing bag, that is a good and healthy way to process this emotion / trauma out of you.

I really recommend is that you make this habit like brushing your teeth, of you have not already I highly suggest you make a habit tracker.



And you can do that by ideally using a real piece of paper putting the month & year at the top, then numbering the days of the month, and then you write the habit name acronyms at the top like healing trauma (HT) and so on, this is also great for any other habit you want to get consistent in, then what you do is draw boxes for everyday of the month for the habit and other habits, then simply of you do the habit you get a tick, of not you get an X.



Then simply do this every month for ever, just tape it up to your wall ideally some were you see very often, and voila, you can also of course do it digitally as well but I really think physical is way better.



And yeah guy’s that is how you can stay accountable to this habit of HT (healing trauma,) and legit just simply just pick a time of the day / use the habit stack method to put your habit of healing trauma.



Personally I value my time a lot and I habit stack my HT habit when I do an existing habit which is cold showers, and that is also great cause cold exposure is excellent at processing your unprocessed emotion, but that’s a guide for another day.



So you do the same. And now I will just give you some general tips, things of that nature for how to stay more consistent and how your mindset should be to this habit / habit tracker.



1. Make it attractive, these tips I believe are actually from the book atomic habits, but anyways you should make your habit of HT / bringing up unprocessed emotion attractive, it should be something you get to do, not you have to do, maybe right before you do the habit you just do a quick visualisation practise of seeing yourself as the happiest most healed version of you, that could help, remember make it attractive.
2. Reward yourself after, personally what I have always done after my HT habit, I actually do some deep work in my schedule and I tick the habit off the box which gives me a good healthy dopamine hit, and I have a nice black coffee with some dark chocolate, this is important.
3. Make it effortless, you never want to feel like you have to do something, instead you want it to be like you get to do something, right?

It was all so odd and monotone. 

But in the dream, I had the overwhelming urge to fly. So I rented a plane, and did. I flew higher and higher, until it was t enough. Then I saw an advertisement for Space Tours, so I took it. The tour goes wrong, and I find myself drifting in the Vast emptiness of Space, tethered to this guy that sounded like my friend. But I wasn’t scared, it was more like, a Strange Beauty, drifting through big empty nothing, passed planets and stars. Me and the Tether buddy simply awaited the End, Cracking stupid jokes as we passed by Anomalies that didn’t even have names, just looked like some weird colorless blobs stuck together. Suddenly, we start spinning, and we think maybe it’s a black hole. The last thing we say to each other is “See you on the Other side!” As the tether snaps and I start falling. 

Next thing I know, I see lights, hurling towards me, Streetlights. I realize I’m somehow back on earth, and I’m blown away, absolutely overcome with emotion, all while Hurling towards the Planet, so big, And Bright, and full of color. I pull a Parachute that I mysteriously just had, and land in my Neighbor’s Back yard, who is sitting on his porch drinking coffee. He asked me, “Long night?” And I told him that I got lost in space, but he seemed completely unfazed, saying “tends to happen”. He tossed me an orange and went inside, talking about his dogs.

When I cut open the Orange, it was completely colorless inside. I sat there trying to figure out why it had no color, and after trying it, no flavor. And as I looked out my window I saw my Neighbor leaving for work. Then I woke up",2,1769607843.0,Dreams,1,1.0,False

1qpbpa2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Beingabetterperson/comments/1qpbpa2/the_money_expert_theyre_lying_to_you_academic/,"The money expert: they're lying to you, academic skills don't translate to a stable career (but these do)","So many smart, hardworking people are stuck. Graduated with honors, got the degree, followed the rules, and still struggling to land a stable, well-paying job. It’s kind of maddening. You were told academic achievement guarantees a future. But here’s the uncomfortable truth: that’s not how the system works anymore.

This post exists because too many *“education influencers”* on TikTok and finance bros on YouTube are pushing half-baked advice. They rarely talk about what *actually* moves the needle in today’s economy. So, here’s a breakdown of what really matters, based on deep dives into research, podcasts, and what employers are actually looking for.

**Academic smarts ≠ economic security. But you can fix that.** These are the real skills that translate into money, based on recent research and expert insights:

* **Learn how to sell (anything)**
* Cal Newport, in *Deep Questions* and his book *So Good They Can’t Ignore You*, explains that people who learn how to market their value, whether that’s selling a service, writing persuasive content, or building relationships, are much more resilient in their careers. Sales isn't just about products. It's about persuasion, pitching ideas, navigating power. Schools don’t teach this, but the market rewards it heavily.
* **Your degree is a receipt, not a signal** A 2022 report from the Burning Glass Institute found that over 50% of mid-skill, high-paying jobs no longer require a degree, what they demand are *skills* and *proof of results*. GitHub projects, viral posts, case studies, testimonials. These beat GPA every time. Build a body of work, not just a résumé.

Networking is not optional According to LinkedIn’s 2023 Workforce Report, **85% of jobs are filled through connections, not cold applications.** Having academic credentials might get you into a classroom. But building social capital gets you into rooms of opportunity. Start small, one email, one DM, one coffee chat.

* **Know how to** ***learn*** **fast and adapt** Erik Brynjolfsson at Stanford showed that the most successful professionals aren’t those with the deepest technical skill, but those who are fastest at upskilling and adapting to new tools. Especially with AI and automation, it’s not about mastering one thing. It's about becoming a meta-learner.

My healing trauma process is simple the first step is to bring up your unprocessed emotion which I have already touched on and now the second and that is to process it and really that is all there is too it.

So let’s do this!



Part 1: Methods



Here I will list EVERY method I can think of to process unprocessed emotion / heal:

1. Act on what your unprocessed emotions want you to do (Obviously don’t do anything stupid.)
2. Shake
3. Breath work
4. Cold exposure
5. Exercise
6. Cry
7. Scream
8. Get angry / loud
9. Rewrite the trauma story in your mind to be good
10. Etc



Part 2: Implement



Out of all those methods I showed you and of course there is more, I would argue the best one is were you just act on what your unprocessed emotions tell you, but disclaimer alert obviously don’t act on doing anything stupid or illegal lol, of that is what it tells you to do, only healthy stuff, okay?



And another thing I will say, do most of these healing methods in your own private space, and as a bonus of you have got this far in your healing journey were you now know how to bring up unprocessed emotion / things of that nature, now what I recommend is someone you can open up to about things like this.



You just need to find a person who you feel comfortable to open up to with this stuff, and be careful who you choose, this will be very helpful.



Part 3: FAQ



“How long should I do the whole processing emotion part for?”



Honestly it depends, I say as a good rule of thumb just do the healing work until you feel like some sort of emotion is done processing, there is really no right or wrong way to do this.



“Does this actually work?”



Yes, legit all trauma is, is unprocessed emotion, and of you bring up your unprocessed emotion, then do one of the healing methods listed, and feel some emotion leaving you, that is fantastic, that is -1 incident of trauma and that equal to you being like 1% better in all areas of life, cause it regulates your nervous system.



“Is this safe?”



Of course and as a disclaimer alert, someone once told me it is dangerous advice to tell people with trauma to act on their unprocessed emotions, and of course do not do anything dangerous or hurt others or anything like that but of for example you are at the gym and you bring up a trauma of bullying, then you go hard on the boxing bag, that is a good and healthy way to process this emotion / trauma out of you.



Part 4: What to do next



Of you have made it this far well done you, you are well on your way to your happiest self, regulating your nervous system, becoming the best version of you and etc.



What I say to do next honestly, of you just make this a daily habit you constantly do, and you always have the mindset now when you go through painful moments in the future in your life like break ups, friend ship loss and etc, always make sure you process it and just make it a daily habit to try and process at least one incident of trauma daily, make it a habit.



I really recommend is that you make this habit like brushing your teeth, of you have not already I highly suggest you make a habit tracker.



And you can do that by ideally using a real piece of paper putting the month & year at the top, then numbering the days of the month, and then you write the habit name acronyms at the top like healing trauma (HT) and so on, this is also great for any other habit you want to get consistent in, then what you do is draw boxes for everyday of the month for the habit and other habits, then simply of you do the habit you get a tick, of not you get an X.



Then simply do this every month for ever, just tape it up to your wall ideally some were you see very often, and voila, you can also of course do it digitally as well but I really think physical is way better.



And yeah guy’s that is how you can stay accountable to this habit of HT (healing trauma,) and legit just simply just pick a time of the day / use the habit stack method to put your habit of healing trauma.



Personally I value my time a lot and I habit stack my HT habit when I do an existing habit which is cold showers, and that is also great cause cold exposure is excellent at processing your unprocessed emotion, but that’s a guide for another day.



So you do the same. And now I will just give you some general tips, things of that nature for how to stay more consistent and how your mindset should be to this habit / habit tracker.



1. Make it attractive, these tips I believe are actually from the book atomic habits, but anyways you should make your habit of HT / bringing up unprocessed emotion attractive, it should be something you get to do, not you have to do, maybe right before you do the habit you just do a quick visualisation practise of seeing yourself as the happiest most healed version of you, that could help, remember make it attractive.
2. Reward yourself after, personally what I have always done after my HT habit, I actually do some deep work in my schedule and I tick the habit off the box which gives me a good healthy dopamine hit, and I have a nice black coffee with some dark chocolate, this is important.
3. Make it effortless, you never want to feel like you have to do something, instead you want it to be like you get to do something, right? This means you must make your habit of bringing up unprocessed emotion as easy possible, do it the way you like it, what method do you prefer? Do that one, what environment do you enjoy doing it in? Stick to that, just do what you want.",1,1769607719.0,trauma,0,1.0,False

I’ve tried meeting people before: I invited a couple over for a game night, which was nice, but afterward they mostly only contacted me when they needed me to take care of their dog 😅. So now I’m giving Reddit a try!

I’m currently building a small automation tool that uses the OpenAI API to parse messy, unstructured CSV data from a client and turn it into clean JSON. On paper, it sounds like AI 101. In practice, I was stuck in a nightmare.

Every time I ran my script, the model would start hallucinating keys that didn't exist or, worse, it would ""helpfully"" truncate the data because it thought the list was too long. I tried everything: I upped the temperature, I lowered the temperature, I wrote a 500-word prompt explaining exactly why it shouldn't be ""helpful.""

By hour four, I was literally shouting at my IDE. My prompt was so bloated with ""DO NOT DO THIS"" and ""NEVER DO THAT"" that I think I actually confused the poor thing into submission. It was outputting pure garbage.

I walked away, grabbed a coffee, and realized I was treating the LLM like a disobedient child instead of a logic engine.

I went back, deleted the entire ""Rules"" section of my prompt, and tried something I saw on a random forum. I told the model:

""Imagine you are a strict compiler. If the input doesn't map perfectly to the schema, return a null value and explain why in a separate log object. Do not apologize. Do not explain the weather. Just be a machine.""

I also added a ""Step 0"": I had it generate a schema of the CSV before it processed it.

I hit 'Run.' I held my breath.

It worked. Perfectly. 100/100 rows parsed with zero hallucinations.

It’s a humbling reminder that in prompt engineering, ""more instructions"" usually just equals ""more noise."" Sometimes you have to strip away the ""human"" pleas and just give the model a persona that has no room for error.

Has anyone else found that ""Negative Prompting"" (telling it what NOT to do) actually makes things worse for you? I feel like I just learned the hard way that less is definitely more.",4,1769607313.0,AI_Agents,3,1.0,False

That’s the easiest conclusion when you’re a single guy in his late twenties watching engagement announcements roll past like weather alerts. You tell yourself you’re awkward, or boring, or that your hairline is retreating faster than your confidence. You tell yourself to pray more. To wait. To be patient.

I went to Gracefield Fellowship because it was supposed to be different. Open. Gentle. The kind of church that put folding chairs in a circle instead of pews and served cold brew next to the hymnals. Pastor Ronan liked to say faith was a conversation, not a rulebook. He talked about honoring all paths, all names for the divine, all expressions of belief.

Everyone nodded when he said it.

Everyone except me, apparently.

\---

I wasn’t creepy. I didn’t corner anyone. I volunteered. I taught the middle-school boys’ class once a month. I stayed after to stack chairs and scrub coffee rings off tables. I asked women out politely and accepted no without pushing.

Still, the answer was always the same. A smile that didn’t quite reach the eyes. An apology that sounded rehearsed.

“You’re such a good guy, Eli.”

“I just don’t feel called to that.”

“Not right now.”

After the fifth or sixth time, you start noticing patterns. Girls who laughed easily with other men went stiff when I joined the circle. Conversations died when I sat down. Invitations “forgot” to include me.

It hurt more because this was church. This was supposed to be where you belonged.

\---

The annual retreat was meant to fix that. Pastor Ronan called it a “re-centering.” Three days in the state forest, no phones after sunset, shared meals, shared worship. The last night always ended with something special. A ceremony. A celebration.

The pamphlet called it The Gathering at Baalwood Clearing.

Most people joked about the typo. Someone scribbled “BALL???” in marker on the bulletin board. I laughed along, even though I didn’t quite get it.

\---

On the second night, after too many hard ciders passed around the fire, I sat beside Mara.

Mara was one of the few people who treated me normally. She had a blunt kindness about her, the kind that didn’t soften truths to make them easier. She was also the one organizing the final night’s event, which made her the closest thing I had to an insider.

“You look miserable,” she said, nudging my boot with hers.

“Just tired,” I lied.

She snorted. “Sure.”

I hesitated, then sighed. “Can I ask you something without you dodging?”

“That depends on the question.”

“Why won’t anyone here date me?”

She stared into the fire for a long moment. The flames reflected in her glasses like a dozen watching eyes.

“That’s… complicated.”

“Try me.”

She took a long drink. When she spoke again, her voice was lower. Less careful.

“Some of the girls talk.”

“About what?”

“About compatibility. Alignment. Whether someone’s… ready.”

“Ready for what?”

Mara glanced around the clearing. People laughed, someone strummed a guitar, Pastor Ronan spoke quietly with two elders near the trees.

“Eli,” she said, “did you actually read the pamphlet?”

“Yeah. It’s a retreat schedule.”

“No,” she said. “The whole thing.”

Something in her tone made my stomach tighten.

“I skimmed it.”

She nodded, as if that confirmed something. “Figures.”

“Just tell me.”

\---

She sighed, reached into her pocket, and pulled out her phone despite the no-phones rule. Her thumb hovered over the screen.

“I shouldn’t,” she muttered. “But you deserve to know.”

She handed it to me.

It was a screenshot of a group chat. I recognized several names—women I’d asked out. Women who’d smiled at me and said no.

The messages scrolled back months.

He’s nice but he’s not fit.  
Not grounded enough.  
Would Pastor Ronan even allow it?

Then one message, pinned to the top.

If we include him, who do we offer instead?

My throat went dry.

“Offer?” I said.

Mara took the phone back. “That’s as much as I’m showing you.”

“Offer to what?”

She didn’t answer.

\---

That night, I couldn’t sleep. The woods were louder than they should have been—branches creaking without wind, something heavy moving far off. I lay in my sleeping bag staring at the nylon ceiling, replaying that word.

Offer.

Around midnight, I got up and found the pamphlet in my backpack. I read it slowly this time.

The language was… strange. Poetic. References to cycles. To renewal through surrender. To the old names we no longer speak aloud.

There was a paragraph I hadn’t noticed before, printed in lighter ink:

Not all are chosen to witness. Not all are chosen to join. Some are chosen to give.

My heart thudded painfully.

\---

The final night came too quickly.

They led us deeper into the forest than before, down a trail that wasn’t marked on any map. The clearing opened suddenly, a perfect circle of trampled earth surrounded by towering pines. At the center stood a massive wooden structure, half bonfire, half sculpture. It was shaped like an arch, horns curling upward.

No one joked now.

Pastor Ronan’s voice carried easily in the night. He spoke about abundance. About how faith was not passive, how it required action. Commitment.

I scanned the crowd. No one would meet my eyes. Not even Mara.

“Tonight,” Ronan said, “we honor the fullness of belief. We remember that giving has always been part of worship.”

The elders stepped forward. Their robes looked heavier than usual, stitched with symbols I didn’t recognize.

Then Ronan looked at me.

“Eli,” he said gently, “would you come here?”

\---

My legs moved before my brain caught up.

Hands closed around my arms. Not roughly. Firmly. Rehearsed.

The realization hit me all at once, cold and absolute.

They hadn’t been rejecting me because I was unwanted.

They’d been keeping me unclaimed.

Unattached.

Available.

“This is a misunderstanding,” I said, my voice cracking. “I’m a believer. I belong here.”

Mara’s face crumpled. She looked away.

Ronan smiled with something like pity. “You do belong. That’s why this matters.”

The structure loomed closer. I smelled oil. Herbs. Something coppery beneath it all.

I fought then. Panic gave me strength, but there were too many hands, too much certainty in their movements. This wasn’t madness. This was tradition.

As they bound my wrists, I screamed. I begged. I prayed to every name I knew.

Ronan leaned close. “You wanted to be wanted,” he whispered. “This is the highest honor we give.”

They lit the torches.

\---

The last thing I saw before the smoke took my vision was the crowd, faces lit with reverence. Relief. Gratitude.

They weren’t afraid.

They were thankful.

Because next year, when the retreat came around again, there would be another lonely man wondering why no one ever chose him.

“Shut up.” I had been awake for a little while, just staring at the wall.

“Can you not sleep?” I rolled over and looked at him as I asked the question.

James was in his rocking chair in the corner of our bedroom right next to the window. The moon outside was illuminating his face.

“I’m ok. Just a lot on my mind.”

“Like what?” I did my best to sit up. I was almost at my due date and I was enormous. During the pregnancy I wasn’t quite as sensitive to his little issues that I normally was.

James suffered from severe bouts of anxiety and he would spend lots of nights just rocking in his chair, trying not to worry about things.

“I think we should get a dog.”

“What?”

“We should get a dog. Every kid should grow up with a dog.” He turned his head to look at me. Most of his face was in shadow, but his eyes were bright. He smiled at me.

“Ok. Is that it? That’s what’s keeping you up?”

“Yes. Oh, and I also love you.”

“I love you too.”

“And I farted.” I had never known James to end anything on any kind of sappy note, so he always had to say or do something childish to ruin the moment. 

I loved him so much. 



\-

“He’s kind of gross.” There were so many dogs at the shelter, but my husband immediately went to the mangiest one. A large mutt with his tongue hanging limply out of the side of his mouth. The mousey brown fur looked like someone had teased it with a brush and sealed the deal with an entire can of hairspray, and he had a slight limp as it walked toward this strange new man making baby talk. I watched the dog cock its head from side to side like it understood what James was saying.

“He’s perfect.” I could tell that James was in love.

“Why him?”

“Well…every other little guy in here is so animated and vibrant. He’s…um…not.”

“He looks like an oversized mouse with bad hair.” 

“That’s perfect!”

“What?”

“We can name him Feivel! Does Feivel like that name?! Who’s a bugaboo doggie?! Who’s da doggie?!” The dog started making inquisitive whines and that lazy tongue came to life and began to lick the strange man's fingers through the chain link fence.

Feivel came home with us, and for a month that dog never left my husband’s side. 

\-

“What happened?”

“Can you put me on speaker so Art can hear me?”

“Ok. You’re scaring me Katherine.” I was trying to hold it together. James’ parents had recently moved to the east coast, so I had no choice but to call them on the phone with the news. “Ok, you’re on speaker.”

“Ok. James… um… James had an accident. It was a hit and run. Someone hit him with a car while he was crossing the street and then just kept driving.”

“Oh my God! Is he alright?”

“He’s um…” I had been with James since our sophomore year in high school, but we had been friends since we were six. I had known his parents for almost just as long. 

“He’s…he’s gone.” 

“Oh my God…”

I had to make lots of phone calls that day. It was the hardest day of my life.

\-

“Mommy needs to talk to you.”

Feivel had been pacing the house for three days. When he wasn’t pacing, he would just sit at the front door waiting for James to come home. He wouldn't sit with me, almost like he blamed me for James not being there.

“Come here. Feivel! Come here.” He finally gave in and walked over to the couch. I patted the cushion next to me and he jumped on the couch and sat down.

He grunted at me several times and when he was done voicing his frustrations, his tongue jutted out of the side of his mouth and just hung there.

I don’t know if it sounds stupid or not, but I had a conversation with him about what had happened to his Daddy and why he wasn’t with us anymore. I felt like it would have been cruel not to.

He stared at me through the whole story and when I was finished, there was a heavy silence between us that was eventually broken by a small cry from him before he put his head in my lap. 

\-

Three weeks later, I had Casey. The birth was rough and there were multiple issues. For a little bit there, I was afraid that I might lose her too. She had to stay in the hospital longer than I would have liked, but when I was finally able to bring her home, Feivel took to her instantly.

He was always next to her.

\-

As the years went by, I made sure Casey knew every detail about her father. I would tell her stories and Feivel would always add something in his own language. I don’t know if he was backing up what I said or perhaps contradicting it, but I do know he was always happy to be included in the reminiscing. 

Shortly after she turned four, Casey’s favorite pastime was drawing with her crayons. I had quite a few pictures up on our fridge of our little family in the midst of imagined adventures. She always drew James in with us. The way she always emphasized his balding head would make me smile.

I would BBQ on Friday nights because James had always done the same. 

When we first moved in, he had built a huge grilling station out of brick and bought this ridiculously large grill that could almost fit an entire cow inside of it. James had said we would need it for the amount of children and grandchildren that we were going to have. We would sit in front of it every Friday night with a bottle of whiskey while he cooked.

Casey and I would sit at the same table and have juice while we made hot dogs. I thought it was important to keep some of our traditions alive for Casey. 

In spite of losing James, we were happy. I started to adjust to a life without a partner, which was not a very easy thing to do since we had been a part of each other’s lives since we were both six years old.

\- 

Almost five years after I lost James, I met Stephen. I was a busy woman with a young daughter and up to that point, I had not even thought about dating. There was something different about Stephen though. I was interested in him from the first time we met.

Casey and I were playing in the park with Feivel one day and somehow we lost him. He just vanished. I looked for him for hours while my mom watched Casey, but I couldn’t find him. For three days I was beside myself and Casey was constantly in tears. Then, Stephen showed up on my doorstep holding our Feivel at the end of a leash.

A tall man with thick hair and trendy glasses wearing a flannel and jeans.

“Oh my God!”

“Hi. I uh…found him in the park down by the river.” I snatched him up and he started whimpering and shaking his butt back and forth. I completely ignored the man at my door. When Feivel had had enough of my pets, he ran inside to look for Casey.

“Thank you so much. Oh my God, you have no idea how much we missed him.” I was wiping tears from my eyes.

“Oh, I might have a clue.”

“Thank you.”

“No problem.”

As I was wiping my nose on the sleeve of my sweatshirt, I realized that the man standing at my door was gorgeous.

“Can I…let me give you some money or something. You have no idea how happy you just made my daughter.”

“No, that's ok. Just happy to help.” 

“Thank you.” 

There was something about the way he looked at me with his eyes. My stomach fluttered. I wanted to invite him in, and the fact that I wanted to do that upset me.

I thanked him. I didn’t even ask him for his name. I’ll admit that I even closed the door on him a little more abruptly than I meant to.

All three of us shared my bed that night. It was the best night’s sleep I’d had in years.

\-

A couple weeks went by and then I saw him again, the man who had found Feivel. He was sitting in the park with his back against a tree, reading a book. Casey and I had been taking turns throwing a frisbee for Feivel, and I saw him out of the corner of my eye. I decided that I would thank him again and apologize for being so awkward.

As I walked closer, I took in every detail. I was sure he was a few years younger than I was and he looked very athletic. His glasses rested on the tip of his nose as he read from *The Winter of Our Discontent*; Steinbeck has always been my favorite author.

Feivel must have seen him just as I was about to say something because he reached the man before I did. I could hear Casey calling for me.

“Hold on honey. Give me a second.” 

Feivel was all over the man and he was laughing at the writhing whining beast who was trying its best to lick every inch of his face.

“Feivel, don’t be rude.”

“No, it's fine. I’m glad he remembers me.”

“Yeah. Wow, he really remembers you.” Feivel was so excited that he started to whimper and expose his tummy. “Feivel! Have some self respect!”

The man stood up next to me. My stomach was fluttering again and I could not stop looking at his eyes. 

“Hey, I have to apologize about…uh the way I kinda shut my door in your face.” He laughed.

“You don’t have to apologize.”

“Mommy?” Casey had run up behind me and was partially hiding herself behind my leg while she stared at the man. “Mommy?”

“This is my daughter Casey.”

“Hello Casey.”

“Hello.” 

“My name’s Stephen.” Casey stayed behind my leg.

“It’s ok honey. Tell him your name.”

“I’m Casey and this is my mom. Her name is Katherine.” 

“Well…you’re a very pretty girl and it’s very nice to meet you.” I noticed that his eyes started to tear up while he was looking at my Casey. He wiped his eyes and shook his head. He was clearly embarrassed. “I’m sorry. She just… reminds me of my niece. We lost her a few years ago.”

We talked for a while that day. Every time he looked over at Casey, I swore that he was on the verge of tears.

\-

It didn’t take very long at all; I was hooked. Feivel was hooked. Eventually, even Casey was hooked.

I tried to take it slow. I didn’t want to date anyone. I wasn’t over James and I knew it, but I just wanted to be around this man and I honestly could not explain what it was at the time. I always wanted him at the house, so he was there all the time. I loved it when he looked at me.

For the most part, he was great, but there were some things that were off. There were things I should have paid more attention to, but again, there was something about him that made me feel like I needed him.

He would kiss me with his eyes open every time, and even though the way he kissed me was great, something about it still gave me the creeps. I would crack my eyes open sometimes in the hopes that he had stopped doing it. Every time I saw those eyes staring back at me, I felt uneasy. I had only ever been with James, so I thought maybe some guys just did that, even though all of my friends thought it was weird too. 

He also did things when he would come over that would raise the hairs on the back of my neck. Maybe that description is a little too harsh for what I was thinking at the time, but it fits now.

He would move things around the house. The toilet paper would be folded in that terrible triangle every time. James used to do that. He would also randomly adjust my coffee cups in the cabinet so the handles all faced the same way. Again, something my James used to do. 

I had no idea what he did for a living, he told me he was in construction, but I had no idea who he worked for. He had never invited me over to his house, nor did he ever talk about his family.

My friends told me that I needed to relax and just enjoy myself. I admit, for the most part he seemed like the almost perfect guy. It was almost like he knew everything about me.

\-

It was three months before he stayed overnight. I had Casey stay over at my mother’s house because it didn’t feel right to have her there.

We tried to be intimate, but I felt dirty. He said it was fine. He stayed anyway. 

In the middle of the night I rolled over and cracked my eyes open. He was in the rocking chair in the corner. The moon was illuminating his eyes while he looked out the window. I thought I was dreaming for a minute. 

“I know you’re awake…Katherine…Katherine?” 

I didn’t say anything. I pretended to sleep. He turned his face to me and smiled. His eyes were so wide and bright.

“Katherine?”

I never went back to sleep that night. I just laid there for a while going back and forth from feeling like I was betraying my husband to feeling like I was an idiot who should just enjoy having a relationship with someone.

Around four in the morning, I had finally begun to drift off to sleep, but Stephen started making noises.

I rolled over and realized that his eyes were wide open. I was going to say something, but he was asleep. I waved my hand in front of his face to make sure.

He began to grunt and his body would shake every now and then. He was having a bad dream and his open eyes began darting back and forth.

“Get out of my head…” He whispered it twice. “Fuck you…out of my head…Mine now…”

It was too much to take. I quietly slid off of the bed and backed my way out of the room. Just as I made it to my door, his eyes moved and focused on me. He was still asleep, but it was like his eyes were watching me just the same.

 I walked downstairs. He continued to talk in his sleep for over an hour. I was pretty sure right then that I had to break it off, or at least really slow down. I just didn’t feel right. And to be honest, I was a little creeped out.

\-



 I was drinking my coffee in the kitchen and thinking about what I was going to say when something caught my eye. Casey’s pictures of our family on the fridge looked different.I got up and took a closer look. James had been changed in every picture. He didn’t have short hair anymore, it was full and he was also wearing glasses. My heart skipped a beat and I felt a terrible lump in my throat. I wondered what this man had said to my daughter to convince her to remove her father from the pictures. I was done.

A few minutes later, he came downstairs in a rush. He was wearing a black Flogging Molly t-shirt. James’ favorite shirt. 

“What are you doing?”

“Good morning! I forgot to turn on the alarm! I’m going to be late for work!”

“Stephen, why are you wearing that shirt?”

“I found it in your closet.”

“But why are you wearing it?”

“Well in case you forgot, I ripped the one I was wearing last night.”

“That’s my husband’s shirt.”

“Oh come on, he’s not going to be wearing it anytime soon. I gotta go, I’ll see you after work.” He leaned in for a kiss, but I backed away. “What’s the matter?”

“I don’t think this is going to work out.”

“What?”

“I think we need to take a break.”

“Over a t-shirt?”

“There’s…there’s a lot of things Stephen.”

“Are you being fucking serious with me right now?” His voice raised, something I had not yet experienced with him. Something in my head told me to back away from him, so I did. I backed right up against the counter within reach of my knives. It made me feel better.

“I think so.”

“But I don’t want to do that. Tell me what I did and I’ll fix it. I’ll take off the shirt. Katherine…please.” I looked right into his eyes. I thought maybe I was overreacting, but the pictures, messing with my daughter to erase her father, that was the breaking point.

“Please leave.”

The kindness in his face fell away to an ugliness that made me start to tremble. He noticed it. A smile slowly started to rise and it looked like he was going to take a step closer. I rested my hand on the counter behind me, inches from the knife block. He halted and stood still.

“Feivel!” My dog ran into the kitchen at the sound of my voice and looked back and forth between us. I could tell that he sensed the tension. Feivel walked over to my side and just looked back at Stephen without making a sound.

“Are you going to sick the dog on me? Are you crazy or something?”

“Stephen, I just want you to leave.” 

“I thought I did everything right.” He let out a sigh. “I had all the answers. I know everything about you and I still can’t make it work. This cannot be my fault…it’s not…it’s your fault! Why are you doing this?!”

“Leave. Now.”

“Ok…I just…” He started laughing and looked down. He tapped my husband's shirt. “Well…shit… I tried to fuck Katherine, and all I got was this lousy tshirt…is that how this going to end?” He just stared at me. I wouldn’t answer him. “I don’t think so. You’re going to change your mind.” He turned and walked out of the door, slamming it behind him.

After he left, I locked all of the doors and called my mother. I told her what happened and not to take Casey to daycare. I told her that I would be able to pick her up in just a little bit. I called all my friends and let them know what happened. I basically wanted to hear other people tell me that Stephen was nuts and in the event that something happened to me, I wanted people to know where to look first.

I ripped all of Casey’s drawings off of the fridge and crumpled them up and threw them away.

I walked back upstairs to get dressed and I noticed other things.

I had only kept a few clothes that belonged to my husband and some of them were missing. I had a small jewelry box on the bathroom counter, and most of the rings and necklaces that James had given me were also missing. I walked through the house and began to notice random little things were missing here and there and the only thing they all had in common were that they were gifts given to me by James.

\-

Before I picked up Casey at my mother’s, I called the police to see if anything could be done, even though I was pretty sure that I knew the answer. Other than being a creep and a thief, Stephen actually hadn’t done anything. There was nothing the police could do.

I took Casey to the park to explain to her why Stephen wouldn’t be around anymore. Feivel was sitting next to her in the backseat. I started by asking her about her drawings.

“I didn’t change them.”

“Casey, honey, I saw them this morning. They’re changed. You changed the way daddy looks.”

“But I didn’t mommy. I wouldn’t do that. Maybe Stephen did it.”

“You think Stephen took your crayons and changed your drawings?”

“Maybe. He thought he was going to be my new daddy anyway, so maybe he thought it was a good idea.”

“Wait. Who said he was going to be your new daddy?”

“He did. He said it lots.”

When we got to the park, I made sure Casey stayed right next to me. We started throwing the frisbee down by the river so Feivel could play in the water if he wanted. I asked her some more questions about Stephen and anything else he might have said to her. It didn’t sound like he had said much more. 

We were about to leave when Casey started waving at something.

“Look Mommy, it’s Stephen!” 

He was standing on the other side of the river, and he was waving back to us. He was wearing a button up shirt and a pair of jeans that both belonged to my husband. He was smiling at me.

“Mommy?”

“Yes?”

“Are you mad at Stephen or something?”

“Yes honey. I don’t think we’re going to be talking to Stephen anymore. I think he needs to go away.” I reached down and scooped up my daughter and began to walk back toward our car. 

“We’re going home. Come on Feivel! Feivel?” My dog had been staring at Stephen and he still hadn’t moved. “Feivel, come!”

Stephen whistled and that was enough for Feivel. He jumped into the river and began swimming toward the other side. I called after him over and over, but he eventually made it to the other side and ran over to Stephen. He gave me one last wave before he reached down and clipped a leash onto Feivel’s collar. He turned around and started to walk away. 

I ran back to the car and put Casey in her car seat as fast as I could and I drove to the parking lot on the other side of the river, but by the time I got there, he was gone with our dog. 

\-

I filled out a report with the police and tried to get a restraining order.

“Ok, so here’s the problem. You said his name was Stephen Tasavo?”

“That’s right.”

“Ok look. This is not going to make you feel any better, but this man doesn’t exist.”

“What?!”

“He gave you a false name, Miss. Couldn’t find anybody by that name fitting his description. You got him on social media anywhere? Does he have any friends?”

“I…I don’t know. I don’t have any of that crap. Social media I mean. I guess I just…never asked him about any of it. We’ve only been seeing each other for a few months.”

“Well, from the pictures you took on your phone, we know what he looks like. We’re going to keep an eye out for him, whoever he is. I suggest you keep your doors locked and inform the people at your daughter’s school. If there’s anywhere else you can go, I don’t think that would be a bad idea.”



I went home that night anyway. Casey was a mess after Stephen took Feivel and I thought that it would be a mistake if I didn’t give her some sense of normalcy. I had four friends stay with me that night. 

\-

A month later I got a call from a number that I didn’t recognize.

“Hello?”

“Don’t hang up the phone Katherine. Feivel really wants to hear your voice.”

“You sick fuck! Give me back my dog!” He was quiet for a moment. 

“I've got you on speaker and you’re saying nasty things like that. He can hear everything you’re saying. Can’t you?! Can’t you?! Who’s a bugaboo doggie?! Who’s da doggie?!”

“Stephen…I’ll do whatever you want…please just give him back to me.”

“Come on Katherine. I know you know that’s not my name.”

“What is your name?”

“You know, I thought I had to become someone else to be with you. But I don’t think so. I’m going to like you getting to know the real me.”

“Please just give me my dog.”

“I’m going to make you see that it was destiny that your husband died. I’m going to make you see that his death was what it took to bring us together.”

“You son of a bitch!”

“Anyway, I’ll see you soon.” He hung up the phone.

I called the police, and after that night, I didn’t hear anything from Stephen for two months. Two months of looking over my shoulder. Two months of waiting.

I bought a gun. I kept it in the drawer of my bedside table. I wasn’t taking any chances.

\-

I woke up with a start in the middle of the night and I heard the sound of muffled whining. I sat up in bed and looked around my bedroom before I grabbed the gun and got up. I walked to my window and noticed that it was slightly open. I looked down into the backyard.

Smoke was pouring out from underneath the closed lid on the grill. It looked like something was tied around the handles in order to keep it shut. I ran downstairs to the patio door. I opened it and held the gun in front of me. The smell of something burning was making me sick to my stomach. Something was crying out inside of the grill, frantically trying to get out. My heart sank as I realized that it was Feivel’s collar tied around the handle.

I screamed and grabbed the hose and turned it on. I lunged for the lid of the grill and I burned my hands as I tore away the collar from the handles.

I threw the top to the grill open and sprayed the hose inside. Feivel leapt out of the grill and down onto the brick patio. I soaked him with the hose. A belt had been tied around his muzzle. I ripped it off of his face and kept the water on him. 

I turned to look back at the house. I didn’t want to leave him, but I realized that I had left my phone upstairs. I opened my mouth to scream for help, but then I had a hard time making any sound when I saw what was on the patio table. There was a bottle of whiskey on it with two glasses that had already been poured. There was a note on the table.

*“It’s Friday Night! Time to BBQ!”*

There was also something else on the table. A small fake rock. James and I had always kept it hidden amongst the other rocks in the [backyard.It](http://backyard.It) had a small compartment on the underside where we kept a spare key to our house. Stephen was in our house.

I looked back down to Feivel. I was left with the awful decision of having to leave my dog. He was gasping for air, but he was still alive. I had to get to Casey to make sure she was safe.

“Feivel, I’m sorry!” I left the hose laying across him and I ran back inside.

As I ran up the stairs, I saw that Casey’s door was closed and as I reached out for the knob, I heard a familiar noise coming from my room. The sound of a rocking chair. I cracked open Casey’s door and I could see that she was still asleep in her bed.

“Kaaaatheriiiiine…”

I closed the door and held the gun in front of me as I walked into my room.

The man I knew as Stephen was rocking in my husband's chair, wearing my husband’s clothes, and holding a house key that only myself and my husband knew about.

“I’ve missed you so much.” I raised the gun without saying a word. My hand was shaking. He was smiling and rocking back and forth. “You’re not going to shoot me.”

“Goodbye Stephen.” I pulled the trigger and nothing happened but a dry snap. I pulled the trigger again, but nothing happened.

“If you held that thing more often, you could probably tell that it’s just a little heavier when it has bullets in it.”

I lunged for my bedside table and pulled the drawer open. The small box of bullets was gone. 

“I unloaded it while you were asleep.” He stood up. I ran for Casey’s door, but he caught me before I could open it. I felt his hand go over my mouth and he picked me up by my shoulders. I struggled as he carried me closer to the top of the stairs.

“I’ve watched you sleep for so many nights now, just wondering how I could get you back. But I think there might not be any saving of what we had.” He hit me across the face and threw me down the stairs.

I heard my ankles snap when I hit the floor, and I screamed. His footsteps were quiet as he started walking down the stairs.

“We could have had a life together. I really wanted that. I even put something on the grill, but then you went and ruined that too.”

“Mommy?!” Casey had run out of her bedroom and was at the top of the stairs looking down on us. Stephen was just a few steps away from me. I started to crawl along the floor toward the kitchen.

“Go back to your room Casey. You’re mother and I are fighting.”

“Casey! Get Mommy’s phone and call for help!” I screamed, as I pulled myself along the floor and into the kitchen. All I could think of was getting to the block of knives.



“Where do you think you're going off to? Wait, I know…”

Stephen ran around me and to the kitchen counter. He picked up the block of knives and spilled them on the floor. “Come and get ‘em Katherine.”

He walked back over and stood over me while I crawled toward the knives. He was laughing.

“To think, if someone hadn’t killed your husband, none of this would have happened.”

I tried to shut his voice out of my head as I crawled forward. I was getting closer.

“You know the person who hit him did actually stop for a moment…just a moment…he opened his car door and almost ran over to help, but then something stopped him. Did you know that?”

He’s lying Katherine. Keep moving.

“I was there. If I close my eyes, I can still see the whole thing. If that guy had helped instead of just driving away, maybe James would have survived and what I’ve had with you and Casey… all that would never have been.” 

I was right in front of the pile of knives. I reached out and then he stomped on my hand. I felt bones break. He leaned down, grabbed me, and turned me over to look at him. He was crying.

“I still think it was destiny that brought us together, but I was wrong about you. You don’t have any place in our family. Me and Casey. I’m going to take her far away from here. She’s mine now.” Tears were pouring out of his eyes and he was trying to blink them away, but the tears wouldn’t stop.

“Son of a bitch! Stop it! Stop it!” He rubbed at his eyes with one hand. “She’s mine now!”

I brought my knee up as hard as I could between his legs and he dropped me to the floor. He fell to his knees right next to me. I could hear sirens outside.



I reached out and grabbed the largest knife. I raised it over my head, but before I could swing it down, he grabbed my wrist and started to squeeze. I felt my grip start to loosen and I was afraid that I was going to drop the knife. He started to laugh as the sirens were getting closer.

“Looks like it’s time we get things over with.”

I felt his body slam against mine, and at first I had no idea what had happened, but then Stephen began to scream and I could hear Feivel growling behind him. 

Feivel had managed to fit his jaws around the back of Stephen’s neck and buried his teeth to the gums. He was pulling Stephen away from me; blood poured down either side of his throat.

I tightened my grip on the knife and I pushed it into Stephen’s stomach over and over and over again. Feivel eventually let go of Stephen, and as I continued to plunge the knife into the mushy mess I had made, my dog limped over and started to whimper.

As Stephen lay there gasping for breath, I stared at his eyes. They were staring back at me and he was no longer weeping. I felt crazy, but his eyes looked kind. They looked happy.

\-

“How are you feeling now?” I remember the detective had this perfect voice. A Paul Winfield voice. Had the things he was about to tell me weren’t so terrible, I would probably only remember how beautiful that voice was.

“I can’t walk, but they’ve got me so drugged up that I don’t mind very much. I’m going to be able to go home tomorrow. Or…to my mother’s at least.”

“How’s your daughter doing?”

“She’s good. She’s staying with my mother.”

“I hear that hero dog is going to pull through.”

I smiled. Tears started coming up thinking of Feivel sitting somewhere without me while he was going through all this.

“He’s not going to be a hundred percent, but he’s going to have a good life. He deserves it.”

“Ok. Now for the unpleasant stuff. We finally got some answers on who this guy is. Was, excuse me. His name is Joshua Linder. He’s been keeping a small apartment only a mile away from your house for the last three years. It looks like he’s been watching you the whole time. All kinds of things all over his apartment.”

“Did he kill James?”

“No. He couldn't have. Up until three years ago he lived across the country from you. Even then, there was no way he was driving the car that killed your husband. He was legally blind.”

“What?”

“Not completely blind, but may as well have been. That is his connection to you, and to your late husband I’m afraid.”

“I don’t understand.”

“You said he knew things he shouldn’t have right?”

“Yes.”

“Where the spare key was, um… certain things you shared with your late husband, correct?”

“That’s right.”

“Katherine, there’s no easy way to say this, so I’m just going to say it. You are aware that your husband was an organ donor, were you not?”

“Yeah.”

“It seems that uh… Mr. Linder was the recipient of your husband’s corneas after your husband passed. Now how he found out about you, we have no idea. There’s some kind of phenomenon that’s called cellular memory that frankly I think is…”

He kept talking, but the only thing on my mind were Stephen’s eyes.

\-

My little family of three moved far away from home. We now have a house next to my husband’s parents where Casey can get to know her father’s parents and Feivel can go on walks with me while I pull him in his wagon when he gets too tired. I try not to think too much of what happened, but I still have trouble sleeping.

Some get used daily and earn their spot, while others slowly migrate into cabinets or the garage.

Lately I’ve been thinking about how people decide what stays out long-term. For example, I have a single-serve coffee machine (mine happens to be from Tastyle) that I use every morning, and it’s replaced a few separate items I used to rotate in and out. At the same time, I’m aware that more features usually mean more parts to clean and maintain.

I’m curious how other homeowners approach this. Do you prioritize simplicity and fewer appliances overall, or are you okay giving counter space to multi-function machines if they get used consistently?",3,1769607111.0,homeowners,8,0.71,False

Looking to make new friends.,"I will start with the most problematic part first, I am married. So if you don't want to do this, you shouldn't have to waste any more time. 

Well, this one is a bit unconventional, and I have never done this before. 

I am a 32 year old guy who is on a work trip to Mumbai and I am planning to stay here for a couple of weeks. Sounds simple, doesn't it ? 

But it isn't. I dont intend on spending my evenings alone walking down hotel lobbies or just meaninglessly wandering around the local roads. I need company. Someone to talk to. Someone who can show me around. Someone who could help me apartment hunting for a longer trip next time?

All this may sound like a dream, or a really unrealistic situation, but I am in my early thirties and most of my friends and colleagues are busy with life, kids and have moved on. And I do feel left behind sometimes. 

For starters, I am decent looking and well mannered. I like reading and spend my evenings mostly reading books or watching sitcoms. Friends and HIMYM are my guilty pleasure, but I also loved Seinfeld, B99 and The Big Bang Theory. 

I hope we can have conversations over coffee, strolling around or just casually hanging out. What I seek is good company and a chill time. I am alone in a new city with no friends. 

I do not know what else to write? Maybe you are curious about my post and have some questions on your mind ? Feel free to reach out and I will try to answer them honestly. If nothing comes out of it, I can atleast try to make the conversation worth your time. ",1,1769607039.0,SFWr4rIndia,0,1.0,False

1qpbdip,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1qpbdip/weekend_trip_to_chiapas_san_cristobal_sumidero/,Weekend trip to Chiapas / San Cristobal / Sumidero [Wall of text],"I live less than an hour from the San Diego - TIjuana Cross-Border Express bridge, and I finally took an opportunity to use it to explore a bit of Mexican hinterland.

The original plan was:

* Cross CBX early in the morning on Friday and fly to Tuxtla, then somehow get to San Cristobal
* Take a full-day tour of Sumidero Canyon on Saturday
* Look around the city some more on Sunday morning, then fly back, landing in Tijuana at 6 pm on Sunday

I paid $363 for the flight + seat upgrades, $158 for two nights in a hotel, $52 for the tour, and $55 for the CBX: $628 total, before travel expenses, restaurants, etc.

FRIDAY

I got to CBX at 5:50 on Friday, for the 7:50 AM flight. The walk across the border was fairly quick, except for the 20 minute wait in line for the immigration authorities. I was at the gate with tons of time to spare. I brought $300 USD in cash (which I ended up not needing at all), and I exchanged another $100 for 1700 MXN in the airport (which I ended up spending entirely.)

The airline (Viva) turned out to be the most budget / bare-bones of any airlines I ever flew on. Not only was carry-on luggage extra (the allowance was only for a single 'personal item' such as a backpack up to 10 kg), but there was no Wi-Fi at all (not even for purchase) and all snacks and drinks were extra. (I never got to find out how much extra, because, on all legs of my flights, the menu was missing from the pockets in front of my seats.)

I started to get apprehensive when the plane was still on the ground 30 minutes after the scheduled departure time.

The plane was scheduled to arrive at 12:45. We actually touched down around 1:05, and then spent a loooong time taxiing or just standing near the terminal. I was near the front (row 9) and I rushed for the connecting gate as soon as I could - which was around 1:25. The flight to Tuxtla was scheduled to leave at 1:40, and, of course, it was at the opposite end of the terminal. But I figured that the airline knew I was connecting and the plane could wait a couple minutes.

At the gate, the sign read “last call”, the gate itself was closed, and there was an airline attendant and two or three other passengers waiting. The attendant checked my boarding pass and asked us all to follow. I did, unsure where we were going.

We walked all the way back to the gate I arrived from, then to baggage claim, and finally to the Viva counter in front of the airport. Between her explanations and info from flight apps, I eventually learned that:

* My flight for Tuxtla actually left at 1:33
* The airline was going to send me there some other way, they had two possible routes (through Monterrey or through Mexico City)
* But, in either case, the earliest I could get to Tuxtla was Saturday afternoon, almost 24 hours late

At this point, I considered just aborting the whole thing, but decided to move the itinerary back one day. I got a hotel room in Holiday Inn Guadalajara Airport, messaged the hotel in San Cristobal, booked a new tour of Sumidero (for Sunday instead of Saturday), and set about figuring out how to get to the hotel.

The front of Guadalajara Airport was a zoo. I tried to get an Uber, but gave up when the driver started interrogating me about something over the phone in Spanish (I got the impression - possibly incorrect - that he was saying he could not drive into the airport and was asking where to meet me.) Instead, I went back inside, found the “Taxis” counter, and they sold me a ticket (310 MXN) which I gave to the driver of one of the official taxis. A short drive (could have been shorter if not for the stop-and-go traffic and massive construction) and I was in Holiday Inn. Here I was on a more secure ground, this was a perfectly conventional hotel and the front desk lady spoke English. I asked for a shuttle to the airport for 5 AM, got to my room and turned in.

SATURDAY

Next morning I was up early. For once, everything went smoothly, I was out of the hotel at 5, onboard the plane at 5:30, and walking off the plane in Mexico City just as the sun was rising at 7.

https://preview.redd.it/5qqsuxumd3gg1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=209e9457459fc94b8f58fac7e2e0c5c402864133

The NLU airport is very new, half of the retail spaces are still vacant. I wandered up and down the terminal for a time, ate breakfast in a taqueria, then dropped in to a lounge, just to see what it's like. Turned out that the lounge had a small free buffet and free coffee.

https://preview.redd.it/6am97vpod3gg1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7d5b996e15b699dca425b888f3656bbf48698751

And, at 11, was in line to board the next flight.

At 1:15, I was on the ground in Chiapas. The next stage was the source of some uncertainty - I was not clear how to get from the airport to San Cristobal. (There is no Uber or Lyft in that part of the country, and the OCC/ADO web site does not show any buses from the TGZ airport to either Tuxtla or San Cristobal.) Fortunately, it proved to be easy.  I simply followed the signs for ‘colectivo’, paid 300 MXN, and was directed to a waiting area and then to a microbus. There were around 20 seats on the bus and all were taken.

By 3 PM, I finally reached San Cristobal. The bus dropped everyone off a few blocks from the center and I walked to the hotel.

The city makes a generally favorable impression. The center is well-kept and has several pedestrian-only streets lined with shops and restaurants. It strongly reminded me of Antigua Guatemala, which I visited twice before: same narrow cobbled one-way streets, narrow sidewalks, one- or occasionally two-story buildings, and at least three cathedrals within five blocks from the central plaza. Like more or less everywhere outside the US, there is some problem with graffiti, but they manage to keep it out of the center. (Beyond the central district, it’s more hit-and-miss, with varying levels of scruff and neglect.) There were lots of people around, most were apparently locals or at least Mexicans. 

https://preview.redd.it/rwqvurjrd3gg1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a7a7e1bf5bc85298cd4302123db1abb2a404bc03

A side note: one thing not immediately apparent from the map is that Tuxtla/Chiapa/Sumidero are in the lowlands, but San Cristobal is quite high up in the mountains. In fact, it is at the altitude of 7000 ft (for Californians: same altitude as, say, Mammoth Lakes). As such, it is significantly cooler than Tuxtla. In January, despite its tropical latitude, air temperature drops into the 50s after sunset and into the 40s at night.

I was registered at ‘Casa Santa Lucia’. Though advertised as a “hotel”, in reality, and probably like 80% of “hotels” in the central district, it is probably best classified as a “B&B”. It is essentially a two-story spanish-colonial style house, with a central atrium and rooms around it. By my count, they have no more than 8 or 9 rooms. The place was nice, though. The room was not impersonal, it was very pleasantly appointed and decorated. The only oddities were that the window in the room opened onto the atrium and the dining area, and I had to ring the doorbell every time I went in or out, because the lobby (such as it was) was always kept locked.

I unpacked, went for a walk, found a place to eat dinner, and had an early night.

SUNDAY

The tour group met in front of a cafe on the central plaza. Around 20 people showed up. Some were local/Mexican, but probably half were clearly foreign tourists - there were people from the US, from Canada, and even one woman from Germany. We were shepherded into two microbuses and the buses set off down the mountain.

First, we visited two vista points along the rim of the canyon. At the second point, there was an open-air restaurant and a few tables with vendors, and we spent half an hour there. Then the buses went north out of the city to a river-side town by the hydroelectric dam. We all transferred into boats and the second part of the tour - up the river - began, while the buses went back without us.

The views up from the river are quite stunning, I took numerous pictures until my camera battery ran down. We spotted countless birds, a huge iguana, several crocodiles, and, in one tree, several spider monkeys (those, unfortunately, were shy and obscured by vegetation, and, even with a 400 mm lens, I did not manage to make any decent shots.)

The only downside was the rather depressing amount of floating trash in the river. It was concentrated mostly downstream, near our starting area, and uneven - areas of mostly clear surface interspersed with patches of garbage, mostly empty plastic bottles (and a nontrivial number of shoes.) We were told that they try to clean the river, but the government does not have enough money. The guide also said that it gets worse during the rainy season (I don't even want to imagine what it looks like when it's “worse”.)

We finally landed on the pier in Chiapa del Corzo at 3 pm and were given an hour to eat, explore and shop. I was not hungry so I just walked around, through 5+ blocks of vendors selling essentially identical blouses, carvings, bracelets, magnets (I really don't see how this arrangement makes any economic sense), in sweltering heat (it was easily over 90 F and not a cloud in the sky.) 

At this point I finally almost got bitten by my poor Spanish. The driver of our bus spoke rapid and not always very clear Spanish, and I was generally lucky to get half of what he was saying (there was a notable contrast with the boat's pilot, whom I understood fairly well.) I understood him to say that we would meet at 4:10 right there at the riverfront … and only much later, almost by accident, discovered that it was supposed to be 4:10 at “La Pila”, several blocks away! I rushed to the correct spot and managed to reunite with the group.

MONDAY 

I had a few hours to kill before heading for the airport. I grabbed the camera and headed back into the city.

North of the central park, the sketchiness level notably increased. On the near-empty Plaza de la Paz, several people with a banner and a loudspeaker were demanding justice for Oscar Trinidad Carbajal. On the north side of the plaza, there was a long line of people, by the looks of it, mostly indigenes, just standing and waiting. (They seemed to be waiting for the bank to open.) On the streets, there were virtually no apparent tourists, but lots of locals, many of them indigenous women, some leading young children or carrying infants on their backs (as seems to be the custom here.) Graffiti and occasional beggars reappeared. A poster on one wall asked for help locating a 12-year-old girl who went missing on January 1. I went two or three blocks before turning back.

Around 10, I finally checked out from the hotel and went to the bus station at the corner of 190 and Insurgentes.

The area there was more akin to the Mexico I was used to - noise, people going in all directions, busted up pavement, wandering vendors hawking everything from cut fruit to TV remote controls, a traffic jam… I got a bit overwhelmed and I got talked into paying my last 250 MXN for a colectivo going to the airport at 11:30. Minutes later, I discovered that I was right next to the OCC/ADO bus terminal, which had two buses to the airport listed on the departures screen. I cursed my gullibility for well over an hour, until I managed to pull up the ADO web site on my phone and discover that ADO charges 292 MXN for the same trip (and likely uses the same microbuses.) (By comparison, they only charge 88 MXN to go to Tuxtla, which is almost the same distance.)

A direct flight took me back to Tijuana, and, by 7 pm PST, I was back in the United States.

I clock that immediately. The way you apologize to the waiter for asking for water without ice. The way your eyes flick to the door every time it opens. You’re already half-gone, even while you’re here.

I chose this place because of the acoustics. Soft jazz, enough clatter to blur individual conversations. No one can overhear us clearly, but everyone can see us. That matters. You like to feel observed—validated—without being known. I learned that years ago.

The candle between us trembles when you laugh. You laugh easily. I made sure of that. I practiced the timing of my pauses, the angle of my smile. I wear the shade of blue you once called “dangerous” when you were drunk at a friend’s birthday party. You don’t remember saying it. I do.

“So,” you say, leaning back, finally relaxing. “This is… surprisingly nice.”

You mean me. You always mean me.

“I told you,” I reply. “First dates don’t have to be awkward.”

You nod, relieved that I’ve lifted the burden of discomfort from your shoulders. That’s what I do best—carry things for people until they forget they were ever heavy.

You don’t notice how carefully I avoid telling you anything verifiable about myself. You don’t ask where I grew up, only whether I like dogs or cats. Dogs, I say. You smile. You always smile at that.

You tell me about your job, your boss, your long commute. I already know the route you take home, the exact minute traffic slows near the overpass. I nod in the right places, ask the right follow-ups. You glow under the attention. People always do when they feel understood.

When the wine arrives, I don’t drink. I pretend to. You don’t notice. You’re too busy telling me about the time your college roommate stole your girlfriend.

I keep my expression sympathetic, but inside I catalog the details you get wrong. You always tell this story with yourself as the victim. The truth is messier. It usually is.

Halfway through dinner, your phone buzzes. You glance at it, then flip it face down.

“Sorry,” you say automatically.

“No worries,” I tell you. “I like when people are present.”

You flush. Another point scored.

You ask me how I know so much about your favorite films, your obscure music taste, the coffee order you swear no one remembers. I shrug lightly, like it’s coincidence.

“We just… click,” I say.

You believe that. People like you always do. You think connection is magic instead of math.

When dessert arrives—your idea, not mine—I let you insist on splitting it. You’ve always liked feeling generous when it costs you very little. I take exactly three bites. You take the rest.

Outside, the night air is sharp. You offer me your jacket. I decline, touching your arm just long enough to make your breath hitch. That was deliberate. You don’t pull away.

“Do you want to come back to my place?” you ask, too quickly.

I tilt my head, considering, like I’m weighing desire instead of inevitability.

“Maybe another time,” I say. “I don’t rush things.”

You nod, relieved and disappointed all at once. You like wanting. You just don’t like being wanted back with equal intensity. It scares you.

We walk toward the train station together. You keep matching your stride to mine. I slow down when you do. I speed up when you hesitate. It’s a dance you don’t know you’re dancing.

At the platform, you ask if you can see me again.

I smile. “Of course.”

You exhale, like you’ve been holding your breath all night.

—

I don’t go home after that.

I sit in my car two blocks away and watch you enter your apartment building through the lobby camera feed I installed last winter. You fumble with your keys, then stop, smiling to yourself. You replay the night, already revising it into something warmer, kinder than most of your memories.

You text me before you reach your floor.

*I had a really good time.*

I wait exactly six minutes before replying.

*Me too.*

That’s important. Too fast feels desperate. Too slow feels disinterested. Six minutes feels chosen.

—

Our second date is quieter. A bookstore café you love but haven’t visited in years because it reminds you of someone you hurt. I suggest it casually. You freeze for half a second, then laugh.

“I can’t believe you picked that place.”

“I have good instincts,” I say.

You don’t argue.

You talk more this time. About your childhood. About the house you grew up in. About the night you and your friends locked a girl in the locker room “as a joke.” You don’t name her. You don’t have to.

You say you’ve changed.

I let you believe I believe that.

—

By the fourth date, you’re leaving clothes at my place. I rearrange them while you sleep so you think you forgot where you put them. You apologize for being disorganized. I reassure you. I always reassure you.

I never sleep when you do. I watch the way your face slackens, how your mouth falls open. You snore softly. You talk sometimes. Names. Apologies you’ve never made while awake.

One night, you say my name.

It’s not my name.

I don’t correct you.

—

You tell me you love how “easy” I am. How low-maintenance. How I don’t make demands.

I don’t tell you that ease is just another form of control.

—

The first crack appears when you cancel plans with me to meet friends you swore you were done with. You text me last minute, adding a laughing emoji like it’s a cushion.

I respond kindly. Always kindly.

*Have fun.*

You don’t notice I stop sharing pieces of myself after that. You don’t notice when I stop asking questions. You’re too comfortable. You always get comfortable right before things fall apart.

A week later, you forget my birthday.

I never told you when it was.

But you should have remembered the date anyway.

—

I invite you over on a Sunday. I cook your favorite meal. The one your mother used to make before she got tired of trying. You comment on how authentic it tastes. You don’t ask how I learned the recipe.

After dinner, I ask you something simple.

“Do you ever think about the people you left behind?”

You laugh, uneasy. “That’s random.”

“Humor me.”

You shrug. “I mean… not really. Everyone moves on.”

I watch your reflection in the darkened TV screen as you say it. You look smaller there. Less certain.

“Do you think they forgive you?” I ask.

You frown. “Why wouldn’t they?”

I stand and clear the plates. I rinse them slowly. I let the silence stretch until it becomes uncomfortable.

When I return, you’re scrolling on your phone.

“I should go,” you say. “Early meeting tomorrow.”

“Of course,” I say.

You kiss me absentmindedly at the door. You don’t notice how stiff I am.

—

The next morning, your alarm doesn’t go off.

You oversleep. Miss the meeting. Your boss calls twice. You don’t hear it because your phone is on silent, a setting you didn’t choose.

By the time you arrive at work, flustered and apologetic, the narrative has already shifted. You feel it in the way people look at you.

Small things keep happening after that. Emails you swear you sent never arrive. Messages appear on your phone that you don’t remember writing. People mention conversations you don’t recall having.

You start drinking more. Sleeping less.

I stay calm. Supportive. The only stable thing in your life.

You cling to me.

—

One night, you tell me you’re scared.

“I feel like I’m losing control,” you say, voice shaking.

I stroke your hair. “You’re just tired.”

You believe me. You always do.

—

It ends on a Tuesday. Ordinary. Rainy.

You come home early, key scraping too loudly in the lock. You look pale.

“I need to talk to you,” you say.

I’m already sitting at the table.

“I know,” I reply.

You stop short. “How did you—”

“I know everything,” I say gently.

You laugh, sharp and brittle. “Okay. This isn’t funny anymore.”

I slide my phone across the table. On the screen is a folder. Videos. Messages. Photos.

Your face drains of color as you scroll.

“That’s not—” you begin.

“It is,” I say. “You just forgot.”

You stagger back, knocking into the counter. “You’re sick.”

“Yes,” I agree. “But not for the reasons you think.”

You try the door. It doesn’t open. You look at me, finally afraid.

“What do you want?” you whisper.

I consider that. Truly.

“I wanted you to remember,” I say. “I wanted you to feel seen. The way you made me feel when I couldn’t hide.”

Your mouth opens, closes. Recognition flickers, then dies.

“I don’t know you,” you say.

I smile. “That’s the problem.”

—

They find you three days later. Dehydrated. Disoriented. You tell them a woman did this to you, but you can’t describe her face. Every detail slips away when you try to hold onto it.

They tell you trauma does that.

I send flowers to the hospital. No note.

You never see me again.

But sometimes, late at night, when your phone lights up with a notification you didn’t expect, you feel it—that cold certainty that someone is watching, waiting, remembering for you.

You swipe. You search. You hope.

And somewhere, just out of reach, I’m still the perfect match.

Hello all, does anyone have any experience having purchased from a website called Crawford Espresso? [https://crawfordespresso.com/](https://crawfordespresso.com/)

I’m looking at buying a grinder for my coffee shop but cannot find evidence that this company is legit.

I’m also looking for other online retailers that have good support or if anyone has recs on a commercial espresso grinder. I have most experience with a range of Mazzers but have my eye on the Mahlkonig E65S grind by weight to pair with my La Marzocco Linea Classic EE 2 group. i like that it removes the step of weighing the grinds but am not sure about the reliability.

I’m currently building a small automation tool that uses the OpenAI API to parse messy, unstructured CSV data from a client and turn it into clean JSON. On paper, it sounds like AI 101. In practice, I was stuck in a nightmare.

Every time I ran my script, the model would start hallucinating keys that didn't exist or, worse, it would ""helpfully"" truncate the data because it thought the list was too long. I tried everything: I upped the temperature, I lowered the temperature, I wrote a 500-word prompt explaining exactly why it shouldn't be ""helpful.""

By hour four, I was literally shouting at my IDE. My prompt was so bloated with ""DO NOT DO THIS"" and ""NEVER DO THAT"" that I think I actually confused the poor thing into submission. It was outputting pure garbage.

I walked away, grabbed a coffee, and realized I was treating the LLM like a disobedient child instead of a logic engine.

I went back, deleted the entire ""Rules"" section of my prompt, and tried something I saw on a random forum. I told the model:

""Imagine you are a strict compiler. If the input doesn't map perfectly to the schema, return a null value and explain why in a separate log object. Do not apologize. Do not explain the weather. Just be a machine.""

I also added a ""Step 0"": I had it generate a schema of the CSV before it processed it.

I hit 'Run.' I held my breath.

It worked. Perfectly. 100/100 rows parsed with zero hallucinations.

It’s a humbling reminder that in prompt engineering, ""more instructions"" usually just equals ""more noise."" Sometimes you have to strip away the ""human"" pleas and just give the model a persona that has no room for error.

Honestly, calling espresso the ""king of caffeine"" might be a bit of a stretch when you look at the extraction physics of a 40–220 micron grind.

​In espresso, we fight for pressure and flow. In Turkish brewing, it's all about total immersion and surface area. Since we're grinding to basically ""coffee flour,"" the surface area for caffeine release is massive compared to an 18g puck. But the real kicker for me is the lack of filtration.

​Unlike the clean cup of a 9-bar shot, the unfiltered nature means we're consuming all the coffee oils and micro-dust (fines). In my experience, this leads to a significantly more sustained energy boost—less of a ""spike and crash"" and more of a ""clean burn"" for hours.
​For the gear nerds here: grinding for this is a literal torture test for most electric grinders. If your alignment is off by even a tiny bit, you don’t just get ""bad coffee,"" you get a clogged, bitter mess.

Stick to coffee/caffeine (tea, energy drinks, etc.) **only in the morning**.  
Let morning sunlight hit your face and take a brisk walk—preferably in the sun.  
Have a proper breakfast.  
Avoid alcohol after 2 PM.  
Stop eating after roughly 6-7 PM—no more food afterward.  
Drink your last glass of water by 8 PM.  
Stick to a consistent bedtime, and go to sleep at the same time every night.

Create a calming environment for bedtime, including scents, sounds, lighting and temperature.  
Play soft music, light a candle or aromatherapy oil, and set your air conditioner to a comfortable temperature—26°C is perfect.  
Steer clear of stressful activities, such as watching the news, mindlessly scrolling through social media, replying to work emails, or watching intense TV shows and movies.

Wear earplugs and an eye mask every night. If you train yourself to get used to them, you’ll sleep soundly on planes, in hotels, and in all unfamiliar places.  
Practice meditation at night to calm your mind: try breathing exercises like box breathing, or when lying down, take deep breaths through your nose, hold for a moment, then exhale through pursed lips.

Once you’ve done all the above, these key nutrients and plant compounds can make a **noticeable difference**, helping your body relax, recover and reset:  
GABA & L-Theanine – Calm the nervous system and shorten sleep onset time.  
Ashwagandha – Promotes relaxation and helps lower stress hormones before bed.  
5-HTP & L-Tryptophan – Support the production of serotonin and melatonin, two neurotransmitters that regulate mood and sleep cycles.  
Melatonin – Helps regulate circadian rhythms and improve sleep onset, especially when your sleep schedule is disrupted.

Magnesium – Plays a key role in muscle relaxation and nervous system regulation. Studies show it can improve sleep quality and reduce nighttime restlessness.

1qpb5xj,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtOfPresence/comments/1qpb5xj/how_to_help_a_depressed_friend_without_making/,How to Help a Depressed Friend Without Making Things Worse.,"

You notice your friend's been off lately. They're canceling plans, barely texting back, or when you do see them, they seem like a shell of who they used to be. You want to help, but every time you try, it feels awkward or like you're making it worse. Maybe you've said things like  just think positive  or  have you tried working out?  and watched them shut down even more.

Here's what nobody tells you: depression isn't sadness you can fix with good advice. It's a legit brain chemistry thing mixed with life circumstances, trauma, and a whole mess of factors. I've been reading research from neuroscientists, therapists like Esther Perel, and digging into books on mental health because honestly, we all suck at this. We think we're helping when we're actually making our depressed friends feel more alone.

So let's break down what actually works based on real psychology, not just good intentions.

## Step 1: Stop trying to fix them

Your instinct is to solve the problem. You see your friend suffering and want to throw solutions at them. But here's the kicker: depressed people have heard ALL the advice. They know they  should  exercise, eat better, get sunlight, think positive thoughts. Telling them this just makes them feel more broken because they can't do these  simple  things.

**What actually helps:** Just be there. Say things like  this sounds really hard  or  I'm here, no pressure.  The book Lost Connections by Johann Hari breaks down how depression is often about disconnection, not just a chemical imbalance. Your presence matters more than your advice.

When someone's drowning, you don't yell swimming instructions from the shore. You get in the water with them.

## Step 2: Ask the right questions

Don't ask  are you okay?  because that invites a reflex  I'm fine.  Depression makes people experts at hiding. Instead, get specific.

Try asking:

*  What's been the hardest part of your day? 
*  Is there anything making things feel heavier right now? 
*  Do you want to talk about it, or do you want distraction? 

Notice these aren't yes/no questions. They open the door without forcing it. And crucially, if they don't want to talk, respect that. Just knowing you asked can be enough.

Research from the National Institute of Mental Health shows that social connection is one of the strongest protective factors against depression. But connection doesn't mean forcing deep conversations. Sometimes it's just sitting together in silence.

## Step 3: Show up in tangible ways

Depression kills motivation. Even basic tasks feel impossible. Your friend might want to see you but can't muster the energy to shower, get dressed, and meet you somewhere.

**What works:** Make it easy. Say  I'm bringing coffee to your place at 2pm, you don't need to do anything.  Or  I'm doing laundry anyway, can I throw yours in too?  Offer specific help, not vague  let me know if you need anything. 

The app Ash is actually pretty solid for this. It's like a relationship coach in your pocket that helps you figure out what to say and how to support someone without being pushy. Way better than googling  what to text a depressed friend  at 2am.

## Step 4: Don't take the distance personally

Depression makes people withdraw. Your friend might stop responding to texts, cancel plans repeatedly, or seem distant when you're together. Your ego will tell you they don't care about you anymore. That's bullshit.

Depression lies. It tells your friend they're a burden, that nobody actually cares, that they should just disappear. When they pull away, it's not about you. It's the depression talking.

**Keep reaching out.** Send low pressure texts like  thinking of you  or  no need to respond, just wanted you to know I care.  Consistency matters more than grand gestures.

## Step 5: Learn the warning signs

Sometimes depression gets dangerous. You need to know when to escalate beyond just being supportive.

Red flags that need immediate attention:

* Talking about death or suicide, even casually
* Giving away possessions
* Saying things like  everyone would be better off without me 
* Sudden calmness after a period of deep depression (this can mean they've made a plan)

If you see these signs, don't keep it to yourself. Call a crisis line, tell a trusted adult if you're young, or in extreme cases, call emergency services. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 988. Better to overreact than underreact.

The book Reasons to Stay Alive by Matt Haig is insanely good for understanding what goes on in a depressed person's head. Haig writes about his own breakdown with brutal honesty. Reading it helped me understand my friend wasn't pushing me away, they were just trying to survive.

If you want to go deeper into understanding depression and mental health support, BeFreed is worth checking out. It's an AI-powered learning app built by Columbia grads and former Google experts that pulls from psychology research, expert interviews, and books like the ones mentioned here to create personalized audio content. You can ask it to build a learning plan around something specific like  how to support a friend with depression  and it generates structured episodes with adjustable depth, from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with real examples. The knowledge comes from vetted sources, therapists, clinical research, so it's actually reliable. Makes learning about mental health way more digestible than reading dense textbooks.

## Step 6: Encourage professional help without being pushy

Therapy can be life changing, but telling a depressed person  you need therapy  lands like telling someone with a broken leg to walk it off. Timing and approach matter.

Instead of  have you tried therapy,  try  I've been thinking about seeing a therapist myself, do you know anyone good?  or  there's this app called BetterHelp that does online therapy, way less intimidating than sitting in an office. 

Insight Timer also has free guided meditations specifically for depression. It's not therapy, but it's a low barrier entry point. Sometimes people need to dip their toes in before diving into full treatment.

Frame it as normal self care, not something only  crazy  people do. Half the stigma around mental health is this idea that asking for help means you're broken.

## Step 7: Take care of yourself too

Supporting a depressed person is draining. You're not a therapist, and you can't pour from an empty cup. Set boundaries. It's okay to say  I need to recharge, but I'll check in tomorrow. 

You're allowed to have your own life while supporting someone else. In fact, modeling healthy boundaries teaches your friend they don't have to sacrifice themselves either.

The podcast The Hilarious World of Depression sounds weird but it's actually brilliant. Comedians talk about their depression openly, which normalizes it and makes it less scary. Good reminder that depression doesn't discriminate and you're not alone in dealing with this.

## Step 8: Celebrate small wins

When your friend manages to shower, leave the house, or even just text you back, acknowledge it. Not in a patronizing way, but genuine  proud of you for getting out today. 

Depression makes everything feel pointless. Your recognition that they're trying, even when it's hard, can matter more than you think.

Recovery isn't linear. There will be good days and absolute shit days. Don't expect steady progress. Just keep showing up.

## The bottom line

You can't fix depression with love or good intentions. But you can make it less lonely. You can be the person who doesn't give up when things get hard. That consistency, that steady presence, can literally save someone's life.

Depression isn't a character flaw or weakness. It's a medical condition that thrives in isolation. Your job isn't to cure it. Your job is to make sure your friend knows they're not facing it alone.",1,1769606447.0,ArtOfPresence,0,1.0,False

The book is free and intended to help people who have no luck in dating, as I once did not, until I found TRP.

 Approx 75% of the content is stuff from TRP (and I actually mean TRP as in what I saw back when I found it in 2017, not whatever the fuck people calling themselves redpilled are today) with approx 25% being stuff from other sources or even stuff where I disagree with TRP.

The following will be a list of advice (a very brief overview, I go into more detail in the book) I give to men to help them find love. I have selected bits and pieces that I think even blue pillers will agree with, the actual book will contain more that would probably be controversial.

I would like blue pillers to tell me which of this advice they disagree with, if any, and explain in as much detail as possible why. I aim to make the book as good as possible and more perspectives will help with that.

I will not be responding to blatant troll comments, or comments which show a lack of reading comprehension or logical reasoning. For examples, if I was to say ""women are on average more emotional than men"" and someone responds with ""I am a woman and I regulate emotions much better than the men I know"" that is a clear example of not understanding averages, and a comment not worth responding to.

Anyway, the list of advice to men who want to improve their love life:

---

**Get your life in order.** You should be doing this stuff for your own sake, but it will help in dating.

- Hit the gym and work on your health. Don't aim to be Arnold buff, aim for healthy, fit, and practical.

- Get a good income. Don't be stuck in a dead end job at 35.

- Get a good social circle that you spend time with. Not only are humans social creatures, so this will improve your mood, you can also meet plenty of women this way, and being recommended by a friend makes it much easier to get a woman interested.

- Put yourself in a position to meet new women often. Even if you are the biggest Chad on the planet, if the number of women you meet is 0, the only thing you'll be fucking is your hand. Don't just masturbate and stay in your room playing games.

- Speaking of games, limit your time, as with any hobby. Don't let them become your lifestyle, and definitely don't play games which consume your life like a drug (Dota, Lol, WoW, Hearthstone or anything that relies on psychological tricks to keep you logging in every day). Playing an hour or two of BG3 a day when you're free is fine, spending your evenings awake until 4 AM cause you can't end on a loss in Dota is not.

- Groom yourself properly. Hair and beard is like makeup for men. This is the one thing you don't want to skimp out on, don't go to the same old barber you always went to as a kid because ""it looks fine"". Get an actual styled haircut/beard.

- Get good fitting clothes, and maintain proper hygiene.

- Don't be a coomer and jerk off every day. Limit porn.

---

**Improve your mindset.**

- Work on your mental issues if you have any, and be a stable person. Don't have massive mood swings.

- Don't blame others for your failures. Boohoo, your dad sucked and didn't teach you shit. You're a grown ass man now, with full access to internet. Take responsibility, become a leader of your life. 

- Fortitude/stoicism. You will fail, and you will fail a lot. Even if you master all of the ""game"", if you're just randomly approaching women, your success rate with a random girl will still be like 20% at best (it gets a lot better if it's someone you meet through a friend). Don't let failure discourage you. In dating or in life. Just keep on moving on. It is what it is.

- Understand that women LOVE sex and that sex is something enjoyable for both of you, rather than something that the woman ""gives"" the man.

- Get it out of your head that a woman having sex = a slut. Do not be judgemental. Understand that sex is a completely normal thing, and nothing to shame someone about.

- Respect her as a person. She's not a whore for having sex. 

- Respect her privacy. Do not kiss and tell. If she asks you about other girls you were with, just be like ""I'm not going to share stuff like that with others, I respect their privacy"". If you respect others' privacy, you'll respect hers too.

- Do not be jealous unnecessarily, but do set limits. Telling your girl not to wear something or not to go out without you is being jealous. Saying that no, she doesn't get to go drinking with her ex-boyfriend who randomly hit her up is setting limits.

- Don't put women on a pedestal. Put yourself on one, if anything. You know that phrase ""Fake it 'till you make it""? If you have no confidence, pretend that you do until you actually become confident. It will come naturally as you become a more complete and successful person.

- Understand that the Disney view on relationships you've been fed by the media and most people IRL is a complete lie. Women are not angelic creatures you need to constantly praise. They are people just like you, with flaws of their own

- Don't be a tryhard. If it's not going well with a woman, take the L and move on. This does not mean you should not be ""persistent"" and give up at the first hurdle, but your persistence needs to be done in a fun, attractive way and you need to recognize when it's time to stop.

- Don't agree with a woman just to agree and get her to like you. If you disagree, make it known. Being spineless is not attractive. Leading us to...

- Always be authentic. If you present yourself as an apple, and she likes apples, what's going to happen when she finds out you're a pear? 

- Understand that dating is a competition. Why should she choose you over anyone else? Merely being ""nice"" is not enough. There's tons of nice guys out there, what else do you bring to the table?

- Don't fall into the ""only money matters"" mindset. Money alone will get you gold diggers. Is that really what you want? Of course it's better to have it than not, but when it comes to seduction, personality and looks >>> money.

- Don't fall into the ""only looks matter"" mindset. On dating apps looks reign supreme, but 95% of men can reach a 5/10 look at a minimum through non-surgical means, most can be a 6 or a 7 (after years of hard work yes, nobody said it would be easy). Looks are just a barrier to entry. If you pass, and being a 5/10 is enough for most women, personality is the thing that shines through outside of dating apps. Sure, 10/10 Chad can fuck most women at the club or Tinder easily, but you're not 10/10 Chad, so why bother complaining about it rather than working on yourself? And that Chad cannot maintain a healthy long term relationship if looks are all he has.

---

**Learn how to be a fun, sociable person.** Incredible as it sounds, women are people, too. Most of the stuff that will get people in general to want to hang out with you is stuff that will get you women, too.

- Be interesting and be interested. Have a wide range of topics for conversation, and be interested in what other people are saying. Being a good listener will help out a ton. 

- Learn how to relax in social situations. If you're naturally shy, that is something you're gonna want to work on. A shy girl will often have men pining after her, a shy guy is not attractive to most women. This does not mean you have to force yourself to be the life of the party, just don't be the meme guy standing in the corner while everyone else is having fun.

- Get good at humor and improv. Humor is essentially a measure of social intelligence and relaxation. You can't be cracking jokes if you're tense and in your head. Someone telling jokes is relaxed, he's confident, he's not reactive, he's more on the leader side of things, and people love it.  If you make a woman laugh (with you, not at you), you're well on your way to making her panties drop.

- **How** you say something matters a lot more than what you say. Two identical twins could say the exact same things to the exact same girl, one could blow it, and the other could go home with her. Insert emotions in your conversations and talk about fun things, not politics or something.

- Don't speak in a monotone tone of voice. 

- Focus on inserting emotions rather than being boring and talking about day to day topics (movies, people you know etc) like most guys do.

- Do not put others down. Instead, lift them up. This will make you well liked by others, not just the girl you are trying to impress. Do you really want to be friends with someone that shit-talks others, let alone be in a relationship with that person?

---

While of course still people, understand that **women are different than men**. If there's anything I can see being controversial, even among this list, it is the following section. 

- Women are more emotional when it comes to dating, and emotions play a larger role than logic when it comes to partner selection for them. You could on paper be the perfect guy, if you don't have ""that something"" that she's looking for (if you don't know how to evoke emotions inside of her), you will not get her.

- Understand that attraction CANNOT be negotiated. It is either present or not, and it is your job to make sure it is. If it is not, don't try to force the girl to like you.

- Learn about preselection and why it matters. It is infinitely easier to get a girl through friends than cold approaching, and if women know other women have already ""vetted you"" they will be more attracted to you.

- Learn what push/pull is and why it matters. By this I do not mean negging or other ""PUA tricks"". Push/pull is a fun game between the two of you, teasing each other and stuff, not bringing her down.

- Learn what shit tests are, and why passing them matters not just for raising attraction, but also in life in general. Everyone shit tests, and once you keep an eye out for it you will see it everywhere. You just never noticed it.

- Make your intentions known (not verbally but through look, touch, and slipping things between the lines in conversation) from the very beginning. Do NOT try to ""be friends first"", it does not end well in most cases. She has to see you as a sexual person to want sex with you. Men fall in love with their female friends often, but the other way around is not that common.

- Compliment something about her personality that you genuinely like, not her tits and ass.

- Avoid interview style conversations (what's your name, how old are you, where do you work, where did you go to school etc.). You don't do that with friends, why do that with a girl you are trying to impress and potentially hook up with?

- Learn cold reading. Make assumptions and make a fun game out of guessing things about each other.

- Do not try to ""buy her"" by taking her out to an expensive place on the first date. Not only does it imply sex is transactional and you need to ""put enough kindness coins into the pussy machine"" to get it, it's also not good for your financials. Your first date should be a coffee or some other similar cheap place, where the two of you get to know each other.

- Many guys get caught up in trying to find the ""perfect approach"" and ""the perfect thing to say"". I want you to forget about all of that. Perfect is boring but to be Human is Beautiful. The perfect approach does not exist, and you shouldn't be stressing out over it because...

- The goal of dating is to have fun. Aim to have fun on the date, and you will naturally have more success with women, rather than staking your fun on whether or not you make it with her. If it didn't work out, so what, at least you had fun.

- Do not randomly try to kiss a girl. Kissing is just a higher level of touch. You don't start your car in fifth gear, do you? How do you expect her to react to a kiss if you did not even hold her shoulder previously? Start touching in socially appropriate areas first and gauge her reaction. If it is positive, proceed towards ""hotter"" areas, until you kiss her. The perfect kiss happens when both people know it's going to happen soon, not when one randomly launchers their face at another.

- Limit texting. It is better to get to know each other in real life, than over the screen. But if you do...

- Try to bring up multiple topics when texting. If you are only talking about one thing and she doesn't like it, or is bored of it, the conversation ends then and there. If there are several topics, she will reply to the one she is interested in, and the conversation keeps going.

- Foreplay is very important to girls, do not skip it.

---

And finally, **after you get into a relationship**...

- Be a leader, always be able to make choices, decide what you do and where you go on dates. Don't be the ""I don't know, wherever is fine"" guy. This does not mean you ignore her desires, if there's a place she wants to go to then it is fine to take her suggestion, but always have something in mind.

- Do not get complacent, do not stop going to the gym or having a life of your own. Do not become an unattractive person again.

- Do not let the girl become your entire life. While spending a lot of time with your partner is understandable, if she's your entire life, what happens if you break up?

- If she wants to break up, do not cry or beg. Your mindset must be that you like her (or love her) but you must never **need** her. Tell her what she means to you and that you want her in your life, but if she's dead set on leaving, let her go.

- You must always be ready to walk away from the girl, if the relationship no longer satisfies you. And not just from the girl, you need to be able to walk away from anything you are unsatisfied with in your life. From the people you're not satisfied with, from a job you're not satisfied with, from the woman you're not satisfied with.

Did the sensible thing: worked my way up from T1 to T4, learned the spawns, got comfortable, got cocky. At some point I thought: Alright, you know what you’re doing now.

Time to invest.

I pimped a Gila.T6 capable. I prepped everything, made a strong coffee, took a deep breath and jumped into my first ever T5.

On the other side of the filament…a room I had never seen before.

Enemies 100 km away. Lightning everywhere. Thick fog. Creepy music. The whole place felt wrong.

My brain immediately went: what the actual fuck is this?

I was so nervous that I didn’t notice:

* the UI telling me it’s only one room
* the exit gate already being open

Instead, full panic mode.



I fought for 16 minutes straight.

Overheated everything. Modules at \~85% heat damage. Sweating. Swearing. Heart rate through the roof.

In my head I was already writing the killmail for my 2.5b ISK Gila, thinking: There are two more rooms, I’m dead. This is it.

Finally, with absolute resignation, I jumped the gate — and suddenly I was back outside.

Alive.

Hands shaking. Coffee cold. Silence.

I’ve been gaming for decades, and I honestly can’t remember the last time a game made me feel like this: fear, panic, adrenaline, relief — all compressed into 16 minutes.

So yeah.

F\*\*\* you, CCP, for making my first T5 run the shipyard.

But also: thank you.

Because that experience was absolutely unforgettable.

Thanks for reading, just a story I wanted to share.

1qpb1o5,https://i.redd.it/dsssu56hb3gg1.jpeg,tested open-ear vs ANC in same hardware - sound comparison with switchable design,"found something interesting for comparing open-ear and anc designs directly, earbuds that physically swap between both forms using the same drivers. eliminates tuning variables since you're testing identical audio hardware in different acoustic environments

soundcore aerofit 2 pro uses dual modular design. open-ear form that sit outside canal vs semin-in-ear form with active noise cancelling.

**testing methodology,**

same source (FiiO BTR5, LDAC connection), same tracks (mixed genres, FLAC files), volume matched using SPL meter app to \~75dB, spent 2 days exclusively with each form to get real feel beyond quick A/B switching

**sound characteristics,**

**open-ear form:**

bass rolls off noticeably below 100Hz - physics of no seal means no sub extension, this is expected not a flaw

mids come forward, vocals clear and well-presented in the mix

treble slightly elevated, likely tuned to compensate for open design's natural rolloff

soundstage feels wider and more natural (open designs do this), but imaging less precise than sealed

**noise canceling form:**

bass extends down to roughly 30Hz region, adequate sub-bass response for most genres

mids sit slightly more recessed compared to open form - tonality shift is real

treble smoother and less fatiguing for long sessions

soundstage narrower as expected with seal, but imaging tighter and more focused

**distortion and dynamics:**

open form stays cleaner at higher volumes - venting prevents pressure buildup that causes distortion

ANC form shows slight compression at louder levels, though both handle fast transients well for consumer-grade gear

**noise cancelling performance:**

reduction feels in the 20-25dB range across mid frequencies from subjective testing on subway and coffee shop - decent performance though not flagship tier. worth noting these use a semi-open fit (like airpods 4) rather than silicone tips, so the ANC won't match true in-ears but gets the job done for noisy environments while staying comfortable.

some pressure sensation with ANC activated, standard for hybrid feedforward/feedback systems. fit matters more here as larger ear canals may get less quiet overall.

**practical use cases:**

open form better for: extended listening sessions, situations needing ambient awareness, all-day wear comfort

noise canceling form better for: commute isolation, bass-heavy music genres, focused listening when you want outside world blocked

neither form replaces proper over-ear headphones for critical listening or reference work

**build quality observations:**

hook swap between open ear and ANC forms stays secure through 200+ swaps over testing period, no loosening or wear visible

hinges feel solid and should hold up to daily use

driver housing uses TPU+LCP composite, TPU flexibility for bass response while LCP adds rigidity for better treble clarity

**compared to dedicated designs:**

open form vs bone conduction (Shokz comparison): significantly better sound quality across board, though still less bass impact than true sealed designs obviously

**conclusion:**

while dedicated open-ear or ANC earbuds might edge out in their respective specialties, it's the only product doing both in single package, which creates useful controlled comparison for understanding open vs ANC trade-offs with same audio source

hasn't replaced my main headphones but fills specific niche for portable use where I switch between needing awareness and needing isolation throughout the day

1qpb1hw,https://www.reddit.com/r/MensDiscipline/comments/1qpb1hw/the_truth_about_working_out_on_your_period_and_4/,the truth about working out on your period (and 4 legit supplements that actually help),"Most people have no idea how much your menstrual cycle affects your workouts. Like, you’re not “lazy” or “inconsistent” for dragging your body through a gym sesh on day one of your period. Hormones are literally sabotaging your energy, strength, and mood. Most mainstream fitness advice just ignores this. But the truth? Your cycle has four distinct phases and knowing how to train with them can change the game for energy, results, and sanity.

This isn’t bro-science. It’s from legit exercise physiology research, hormone studies, and female-focused training protocols. Think: Dr. Stacy Sims (""Roar""), the WHOOP podcast, and meta-analyses in the *British Journal of Sports Medicine*. Here’s what science actually says.

**1. Your strength peaks in the follicular phase (day 1–14)**  
Right after your period starts, estrogen rises fast. This boosts muscle-building, recovery, and pain tolerance. A 2020 study in *Frontiers in Physiology* found that women who strength-trained more in this phase saw better lean mass gains than those who trained evenly across their cycle. This is the time to lift heavy, push hard, try PRs.

**2. During your period, reduce intensity, not movement**  
You don’t need to skip workouts, but scale them. Light cardio, mobility work, or yoga can ease cramps and improve mood. A 2019 paper in *Sports Medicine* showed low-intensity movement can reduce prostaglandin levels (what causes cramps). Don’t expect your best HIIT session here. Be kind to your body.

**3. Skip caffeine, try magnesium for PMS and better sleep**  
In the luteal phase (the week before your period), progesterone spikes. This messes with sleep and causes mood swings. Instead of overdoing coffee, try magnesium glycinate (200–400mg). A study in *Journal of Women's Health* showed it reduces PMS symptoms, improves cortisol regulation, and boosts sleep quality.

**4. Supplement smart: these 4 actually help**  
Most “period supplements” are placebos in a bottle. But four have solid backing:

* **Iron** (especially if your flow is heavy) to maintain energy and prevent fatigue.
* **Magnesium** for cramps and sleep, like above.
* **Omega-3s** to reduce inflammation and mood swings.
* **Vitamin B6** for bloating and irritability. A 2017 review in *Nutrients* linked B6 to lower PMS severity.

BTW, training around your cycle isn’t just about comfort. it affects real gains. A 2021 meta-review in *BJSM* confirmed that aligning exercise with menstrual phases improves motivation and performance outcomes vs ignoring it.

No, you don’t need to obsess over every hormone shift. But understanding your body’s rhythm gives you more control. More progress. Less burnout. Less guilt.

The good thing is, it was a free ebook, so it didn't feel like a waste when I stopped reading after a few chapters. I thought I could suffer through it, but no. Every chapter had to be centered around not one, but the two single mum's children.

My actual book review for it was more polite and professional, so something I didn't mention was how...cheesy? the writing was. One of the lines was literally:

""Yep. That's mom life."" 

I wish I could have seen my eye roll.

You know what made the book worse? The male lead was a man who left his girlfriend, who he had a good relationship with, because he was scared about committing to a relationship. Then, he had the audacity to ask the single mum on a coffee date, knowing she had two small children.

If you couldn't stay in the good relationship you already had, do you really think you'll handle a relationship AND two kids?? 

Where's the logic in this!? 

Anyway, just reading about her child's elephant plush toy, picking them up from their new school, and a stupid argument between the two about some useless school project was enough for me.Oh, and her talking about her kids with every other character. Ugh.

I felt like I got tricked. I went into the book to read a thriller romance, and got a book about the main character's busy ""mom life.""

This is why I skip through any single parent romances I see. The fact that one of the characters already has kids just ruins it.",17,1769605953.0,childfree,10,0.87,False

The layout options are versatile, allowing for creativity while still prioritizing comfort and functionality. Let’s delve into some exciting layouts that cater to various lifestyles and needs.

### Open Concept Living

One popular layout for a five-bedroom barndominium is the open concept design. This layout typically features a grand living area that seamlessly connects to the kitchen and dining space.

- **Natural Light:** Large windows can fill the space with sunlight, enhancing the overall ambiance.
- **Modern Touch:** The contemporary style appeals to many and creates an inviting atmosphere.

### Split Floor Plan

An alternative that many families find beneficial is the split floor plan. This layout typically positions the master suite on one side of the barndominium, while the other four bedrooms are located on the opposite end. This design provides privacy for parents while keeping kids close by. Here are some advantages of the split floor plan:

- **Privacy:** Adults can enjoy their quiet space away from the hustle and bustle of children.
- **Noise Control:** Bedrooms are separated, minimizing disturbances during late-night study sessions or family movie nights.
- **Personal Space:** Each family member has a bit more independence with distinct sleeping areas.

### Multi-Generational Living

The multi-generational layout is dedicated to accommodating larger groups, such as extended families. This design often includes two master suites, each featuring an en-suite bathroom. With an emphasis on both communal and private space, this layout is gaining popularity. Here’s why:

- **Comfort for All:** With multiple living spaces, everyone can have their preferred area to retreat.
- **Shared Amenities:** Common areas can serve as a hub for family gatherings without sacrificing personal privacy.
- **Future-Proof:** Plan for potential needs by making space for elderly family members, ensuring comfort for years to come.

### Work-from-Home Friendly

### Back-to-Nature Retreat

- **Outdoor Living Space:** A spacious deck or patio can function as an extension of the home, great for outdoor gatherings.

</div>Modern Design Elements to Enhance Your Barndominium Experience
--------------------------------------------------------------

When you decide to embrace the barndominium lifestyle, you embark on a journey of spacious living combined with modern design. By incorporating contemporary design elements into your barndominium, you can transform a simple space into a stylish haven. Here are key ideas to enhance your living experience.

Large open spaces are one of the defining features of a barndominium. Their flexible layouts allow you to create the ideal environment that fits your lifestyle. Opt for an open floor plan that connects the living area, kitchen, and dining space. This approach not only maximizes sunlight but also provides a feeling of spaciousness. When you can walk freely between these areas, it invites interaction and warmth into your home.

A modern barndominium should highlight natural materials that connect the indoors to the outdoors. Consider using wood and metal in your interior finishes. Exposed beams add character to your ceiling while maintaining the rustic ambiance of barn structures. Pair this with sleek metal accents for a contemporary twist. The play of textures creates a warm and inviting atmosphere, making your space feel unique and comforting.

Lighting design is crucial in setting the mood for any room. Incorporate a variety of light sources such as pendant lights, floor lamps, and recessed lighting. Choose light fixtures that reflect modern design but maintain a cozy feel. Consider using Edison bulbs for an industrial touch, or go for minimalist styles that blend seamlessly into your decor. Additionally, maximizing natural light with large windows or skylights enhances your connection to nature while keeping your living space bright and inviting.

Color plays a significant role in modern design. Create a cohesive color palette that reflects your personal style. Neutral tones like grays, whites, and beiges can serve as a beautiful backdrop for your decor. From there, add pops of color through decor items such as cushions, rugs, and artwork. This approach will maintain a fresh feeling while allowing you the flexibility to change up your space as trends evolve.

While decor is essential, functionality should never be disregarded. Invest in multi-functional furniture that can adapt to your needs. For instance, consider a coffee table with built-in storage or a sofa bed for guests. This versatility is a hallmark of modern design, allowing your barndominium to not only look chic but also work for you. Maximizing storage options is also vital; think about utilizing vertical space with shelving and cleverly designed closets to keep everything organized.

Landscaping is just as important as interior design. Consider adding outdoor spaces that enhance your barndominium experience. Decks and patios allow for open-air living. You can create an outdoor dining area or a cozy nook for relaxation. Beautiful landscaping adds value and aesthetic appeal, inviting nature into your home. Choose native plants and sustainable designs to create a functional yet beautiful outdoor space.

Technology is an integral part of modern living, and your barndominium can embrace it seamlessly. Smart home features like programmable thermostats, energy-efficient appliances, and security systems are practical enhancements that make daily living easier. These modern amenities allow you to control your environment, contributing to a more comfortable and energy-efficient home.

Art and personal decor play a huge role in making your barndominium feel like home. Showcase artwork that resonates with you or exhibitions of local artists. Remember, the goal is to reflect your personality within the modern design framework. This mix of personal touch against a background of sleek design will create an inviting and enjoyable atmosphere.

Creating a modern barndominium involves thoughtful integration of design elements. From an open layout to the incorporation of natural materials, lighting, color, and technology, each aspect contributes to an elevated living experience. Embrace these concepts to truly enhance your barndominium, making it a stylish and comfortable retreat that reflects your unique lifestyle.

### Conclusion

Choosing a five-bedroom barndominium layout opens up a world of possibilities for spacious living while marrying rustic charm with modern aesthetics. The well-thought-out designs provide ample room for families to grow and interact, allowing for comfortable private spaces while fostering community in shared areas. Whether you lean toward a more traditional layout or a cutting-edge open concept, the flexibility in these designs can suit various lifestyles and preferences.

Integrating modern design elements into your barndominium can elevate your living experience significantly. From high ceilings and expansive windows that invite natural light to chic finishes that add a contemporary flair, the right touches can transform the rustic structure into a stylish sanctuary. Elements like open floor plans, sleek cabinetry, and smart technology not only enhance functionality but also create a welcoming atmosphere where comfort meets style.

These layouts and designs encourage you to envision a life that balances practicality with modern elegance. They can accommodate family gatherings, create serene personal retreats, or even serve as spaces for hosting events. By focusing on both spaciousness and contemporary style, the five-bedroom barndominium proves to be a unique solution for those seeking a home that truly reflects their lifestyles.

As you consider your options, remember that the key is to create a space that feels right for you and your family. Designing your dream barndominium is not just about constructing walls; it’s about crafting a lifestyle that blends love, laughter, and lasting memories in a spacious, modern environment.

I apologize for the long text, but I am loosing myself and my life and I don;t even know what is wrong. I am 48 years old and I am not sure if I am at the perimenopause phase but I have various symptoms that seem to fit. I did some hormonal tests and according to my doctor I should expect to enter menopause around 53-54 years old. I have periods more often than before, every 21 days and they are really heavy. But what troubles me most is some strange episodes of extreme fatigue that I get at various points in my day, every day for the last year. I did various blood tests and everything comes back normal, I only had low iron and ferritin in summer and I did IV infusion. Iron and ferritin increased quickly but these episodes did not stop at all. 

I am not sure if fatigue is the correct word to describe them actually. I feel it mostly at the head, while the rest of my body may be full of energy. It is not exactly dizziness nor sleepiness, it is not the dizziness we have when we have hypotension or the symptoms we have when we haven't eaten for many hours and our blood sugar drops. It is more the heavy head feeling we get if we take a drowsing medicine like Dramamine for example, but at an extreme level, that I cannot function anymore, I need to sit down, I feel like I cannot hold my head up, sometimes I feel I am actually dying. I cannot think clearly and I have a strong buzz in my ears. It seems to be irrelevant to food, sometimes it happens when I have not eaten but most often after food. When it is really bad I have light nausea as well. It strikes very suddenly, almost every day around noon and 1-2 more times later in the day. Caffeine does not help at all, sometimes I have the impression it triggers it. Strangely what seems to help is to force myself to do a physical activity at that moment. If I collect my courage and really push myself to do a chore or something, it starts go away after 10-15 minutes, not completely, but it turns to actual fatigue and sleepiness. I have not felt normal for almost a year now. 

Surprisingly,  the only period I didn't get any of these episodes at all was beginning of September, when I had to deliver something very urgent at work (thank God I work from home) and I was working on the pc for about 7-8 days non-stop, 16-18 hours per day, very little sleep, very little or non-at-all food, only coffees, fruit and chocolates, extreme situation. However it is the only few days I felt myself again, alive and strong and healthy. 

I really feel desperate, this thing has destroyed my life and that of my family, I am afraid to go out because I never know when it will strike, I cannot play with my daughter anymore, I cannot go out with my husband anymore, I cannot travel, I miss fantastic business opportunities, opportunities that I worked very hard for, because I cannot attend physical business meetings. The doctors say everything is OK, I am very healthy and it should not be perimenopause because it is still early and I should expect symptoms about a year before the menopause phase. Then what can it be? I feel so sick all the time, I mean really ill, that ""I will die tonight"" ill, it is absolutely impossible that I don't have a serious health problem, but why can't they find it? I am thinking it may be something from the nervous system, I don't know what else to search to be sincere. I don't believe either that it is perimenopause because I was watching all my life middle-aged women functioning normally, Ok maybe tired or in a bad mood or with joint pain or hot flashes, but they could function. Me on the other hand, I cannot function anymore. 

Besides that, there are 3 more things that have started in the last couple of years that I didn't have before: 1) I started getting car-sick which is very strange because I never had such an issue, not even as a child, I have done huge road-trips with any vehicle you can imagine in really bad roads while now I may get dizzy even in the first turn after home, 2) I cannot tolerate physical symptoms any more, even a light pain or dizziness or nausea or discomfort it makes me suffer and that causes me an extra stress, that if other health problems start as I am getting older I will not be able to live with them and 3) extreme brain fog and ADHD-like symptoms. I have studied at a high level, did a PhD working as a scientific researcher the last 25 years, started businesses the same time, had my family, I have travelled a lot, 6-8 trips per year, too many hobbies, I mean I was always very active mentally and physically and suddenly I cannot function anymore. What is wrong with me? Could it really be perimenopause and if yes, is it normal to be that bad? And what is coming next? Menopause will be even worst? And does it ever get better after some age or my life is over? Does any of it sounds familiar to anyone? ",10,1769605810.0,Perimenopause,2,1.0,False

I love the idea of freshly ground coffee, but in reality, anything that adds extra steps tends to get skipped once life gets busy.

Over time I’ve tried both setups. Most recently, I used a single-serve machine from Tastyle that works with pods and grounds and also has a detachable milk frother. What stood out wasn’t making the best coffee, but how easy it was to stick with. Being able to make a quick hot cup, an iced coffee, or fill a travel mug without pulling out multiple tools made a difference on workday mornings.

I’m still on the fence about machines that try to do everything, especially when it comes to durability, but I’ve noticed that convenience usually wins when time is limited. If something fits into the routine, it actually gets used.

Curious how other working moms feel about this, do you prefer a simple setup with separate pieces, or an all-in-one machine that saves time even if it’s not perfect?",9,1769605643.0,workingmoms,14,0.71,False

Since having my baby, I have barely been able to do my 20 minutes of PT exercises. I feel like the lack of exercise is killing my mental health. 

I told myself that I'll go back to the gym. Muay thai is out because every place does class at 6 or 7 and that's dinner and bed time. 

I've thought about doing power lifting as I also enjoy that and gyms have more flexible hours... but.... when? I do mornings and daycare drop off at 8ish. I then go home and walk my dog and if I'm lucky, make coffee and maybe shower before work at 9. I use my breaks to pump and walk my dog.

I finish at 5 and then make dinner, play with baby, bathe baby, put him to bed at 7.30. Get his stuff and my stuff ready for tomorrow. Pump at 8.30. Sleep at 9. Wake up to pump at 5. Baby is up at 5.45. Repeat. 

I do have a partner, but I can't imagine leaving the baby with him for two or three nights a week for an hour while I work out. It feels selfish but also... I just don't want to miss that time!! I already feel like I miss so much doing daycare. and to be clear, my partner is an excellent father. I just miss my baby! 

Working out after the baby is asleep seems impossible since I pump and then am exhausted and just want to sleep.

1qpaosw,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Hamster729/comments/1qpaosw/weekend_trip_to_chiapas_san_cristobal_sumidero/,Weekend trip to Chiapas / San Cristobal / Sumidero [Wall of text],"I live less than an hour from the San Diego - TIjuana Cross-Border Express bridge, and I finally took an opportunity to use it to explore a bit of Mexican hinterland.

The original plan was:

* Cross CBX early in the morning on Friday and fly to Tuxtla, then somehow get to San Cristobal
* Take a full-day tour of Sumidero Canyon on Saturday
* Look around the city some more on Sunday morning, then fly back, landing in Tijuana at 6 pm on Sunday

I paid $363 for the flight + seat upgrades, $158 for two nights in a hotel, $52 for the tour, and $55 for the CBX: $628 total, before travel expenses, restaurants, etc.

FRIDAY

I got to CBX at 5:50 on Friday, for the 7:50 AM flight. The walk across the border was fairly quick, except for the 20 minute wait in line for the immigration authorities. I was at the gate with tons of time to spare. I brought $300 USD in cash (which I ended up not needing at all), and I exchanged another $100 for 1700 MXN in the airport (which I ended up spending entirely.)

The airline (Viva) turned out to be the most budget / bare-bones of any airlines I ever flew on. Not only was carry-on luggage extra (the allowance was only for a single 'personal item' such as a backpack up to 10 kg), but there was no Wi-Fi at all (not even for purchase) and all snacks and drinks were extra. (I never got to find out how much extra, because, on all legs of my flights, the menu was missing from the pockets in front of my seats.)

I started to get apprehensive when the plane was still on the ground 30 minutes after the scheduled departure time.

The plane was scheduled to arrive at 12:45. We actually touched down around 1:05, and then spent a loooong time taxiing or just standing near the terminal. I was near the front (row 9) and I rushed for the connecting gate as soon as I could - which was around 1:25. The flight to Tuxtla was scheduled to leave at 1:40, and, of course, it was at the opposite end of the terminal. But I figured that the airline knew I was connecting and the plane could wait a couple minutes.

At the gate, the sign read “last call”, the gate itself was closed, and there was an airline attendant and two or three other passengers waiting. The attendant checked my boarding pass and asked us all to follow. I did, unsure where we were going.

We walked all the way back to the gate I arrived from, then to baggage claim, and finally to the Viva counter in front of the airport. Between her explanations and info from flight apps, I eventually learned that:

* My flight for Tuxtla actually left at 1:33
* The airline was going to send me there some other way, they had two possible routes (through Monterrey or through Mexico City)
* But, in either case, the earliest I could get to Tuxtla was Saturday afternoon, almost 24 hours late

At this point, I considered just aborting the whole thing, but decided to move the itinerary back one day. I got a hotel room in Holiday Inn Guadalajara Airport, messaged the hotel in San Cristobal, booked a new tour of Sumidero (for Sunday instead of Saturday), and set about figuring out how to get to the hotel.

The front of Guadalajara Airport was a zoo. I tried to get an Uber, but gave up when the driver started interrogating me about something over the phone in Spanish (I got the impression - possibly incorrect - that he was saying he could not drive into the airport and was asking where to meet me.) Instead, I went back inside, found the “Taxis” counter, and they sold me a ticket (310 MXN) which I gave to the driver of one of the official taxis. A short drive (could have been shorter if not for the stop-and-go traffic and massive construction) and I was in Holiday Inn. Here I was on a more secure ground, this was a perfectly conventional hotel and the front desk lady spoke English. I asked for a shuttle to the airport for 5 AM, got to my room and turned in.

SATURDAY

Next morning I was up early. For once, everything went smoothly, I was out of the hotel at 5, onboard the plane at 5:30, and walking off the plane in Mexico City just as the sun was rising at 7.

https://preview.redd.it/oldymequ73gg1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=11aba57630dc05449f955ec51a73863d1d378708

The NLU airport is very new, half of the retail spaces are still vacant. I wandered up and down the terminal for a time, ate breakfast in a taqueria, then dropped in to a lounge, just to see what it's like. Turned out that the lounge had a small free buffet and free coffee.

https://preview.redd.it/5uk51wvv73gg1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9d031f611267c4ce79bdbded2a65235f6a544ca7

And, at 11, was in line to board the next flight.

At 1:15, I was on the ground in Chiapas. The next stage was the source of some uncertainty - I was not clear how to get from the airport to San Cristobal. Fortunately, it proved to be easy.  I simply followed the signs for ‘colectivo’, paid 300 MXN, and was directed to a waiting area and then to a microbus. There were around 20 seats on the bus and all were taken.

By 3 PM, I finally reached San Cristobal. The bus dropped everyone off a few blocks from the center and I walked to the hotel.

The city makes a generally favorable impression. The center is well-kept and has several pedestrian-only streets lined with shops and restaurants. It strongly reminded me of Antigua Guatemala, which I visited twice before: same narrow cobbled one-way streets, narrow sidewalks, one- or occasionally two-story buildings, and at least three cathedrals within five blocks from the central plaza. Like more or less everywhere outside the US, there is some problem with graffiti, but they manage to keep it out of the center. (Beyond the central district, it’s more hit-and-miss, with varying levels of scruff and neglect.) There were lots of people around, most were apparently locals or at least Mexicans. 

https://preview.redd.it/ols9cbr283gg1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e5024b8dea08a5de6a64c8a51292a2301ddf2326

A side note: one thing not immediately apparent from the map is that Tuxtla/Chiapa/Sumidero are in the lowlands, but San Cristobal is quite high up in the mountains. In fact, it is at the altitude of 7000 ft (for Californians: same altitude as, say, Mammoth Lakes). As such, it is significantly cooler than Tuxtla. In January, despite its tropical latitude, air temperature drops into the 50s after sunset and into the 40s at night.

I was registered at ‘Casa Santa Lucia’. Though advertised as a “hotel”, in reality, and probably like 80% of “hotels” in the central district, it is probably best classified as a “B&B”. It is essentially a two-story spanish-colonial style house, with a central atrium and rooms around it. By my count, they have no more than 8 or 9 rooms. The place was nice, though. The room was not impersonal, it was very pleasantly appointed and decorated. The only oddities were that the window in the room opened onto the atrium and the dining area, and I had to ring the doorbell every time I went in or out, because the lobby (such as it was) was always kept locked.

I unpacked, went for a walk, found a place to eat dinner, and had an early night.

SUNDAY

The tour group met in front of a cafe on the central plaza. Around 20 people showed up. Some were local/Mexican, but probably half were clearly foreign tourists - there were people from the US, from Canada, and even one woman from Germany. We were shepherded into two microbuses and the buses set off down the mountain.

First, we visited two vista points along the rim of the canyon. At the second point, there was an open-air restaurant and a few tables with vendors, and we spent half an hour there. Then the buses went north out of the city to a river-side town by the hydroelectric dam. We all transferred into boats and the second part of the tour - up the river - began, while the buses went back without us.

The views up from the river are quite stunning, I took numerous pictures until my camera battery ran down. We spotted countless birds, a huge iguana, several crocodiles, and, in one tree, several spider monkeys (those, unfortunately, were shy and obscured by vegetation, and, even with a 400 mm lens, I did not manage to make any decent shots.)

The only downside was the rather depressing amount of floating trash in the river. It was concentrated mostly downstream, near our starting area, and uneven - areas of mostly clear surface interspersed with patches of garbage, mostly empty plastic bottles (and a nontrivial number of shoes.) We were told that they try to clean the river, but the government does not have enough money. The guide also said that it gets worse during the rainy season (I don't even want to imagine what it looks like when it's “worse”.)

We finally landed on the pier in Chiapa del Corzo at 3 pm and were given an hour to eat, explore and shop. I was not hungry so I just walked around, through 5+ blocks of vendors selling essentially identical blouses, carvings, bracelets, magnets (I really don't see how this arrangement makes any economic sense), in sweltering heat (it was easily over 90 F and not a cloud in the sky.) 

At this point I finally almost got bitten by my poor Spanish. The driver of our bus spoke rapid and not always very clear Spanish, and I was generally lucky to get half of what he was saying (there was a notable contrast with the boat's pilot, whom I understood fairly well.) I understood him to say that we would meet at 4:10 right there at the riverfront … and only much later, almost by accident, discovered that it was supposed to be 4:10 at “La Pila”, several blocks away! I rushed to the correct spot and managed to reunite with the group.

MONDAY 

I had a few hours to kill before heading for the airport. I grabbed the camera and headed back into the city.

North of the central park, the sketchiness level notably increased. On the near-empty Plaza de la Paz, several people with a banner and a loudspeaker were demanding justice for Oscar Trinidad Carbajal. On the north side of the plaza, there was a long line of people, by the looks of it, mostly indigenes, just standing and waiting. (They seemed to be waiting for the bank to open.) On the streets, there were virtually no apparent tourists, but lots of locals, many of them indigenous women, some leading young children or carrying infants on their backs (as seems to be the custom here.) Graffiti and occasional beggars reappeared. I went two or three blocks before turning back.

Around 10, I finally checked out from the hotel and went to the bus station at the corner of 190 and Insurgentes.

The area there was more akin to the Mexico I was used to - noise, people going in all directions, busted up pavement, wandering vendors hawking everything from cut fruit to TV remote controls, a traffic jam… I got a bit overwhelmed and I got talked into paying my last 250 MXN for a colectivo going to the airport at 11:30. Minutes later, I discovered that I was right next to the OCC/ADO bus terminal, which had two buses to the airport listed on the departures screen. I cursed my gullibility for well over an hour, until I managed to pull up the ADO web site on my phone and discover that ADO charges 292 MXN for the same trip (and likely uses the same microbuses.) (By comparison, they only charge 88 MXN to go to Tuxtla, which is almost the same distance.)

A direct flight took me back to Tijuana, and, by 7 pm PST, I was back in the United States.

I’m currently building a small automation tool that uses the OpenAI API to parse messy, unstructured CSV data from a client and turn it into clean JSON. On paper, it sounds like AI 101. In practice, I was stuck in a nightmare. Every time I ran my script, the model would start hallucinating keys that didn't exist or, worse, it would ""helpfully"" truncate the data because it thought the list was too long. I tried everything: I upped the temperature, I lowered the temperature, I wrote a 500-word prompt explaining exactly why it shouldn't be ""helpful.""

By hour four, I was literally shouting at my IDE. My prompt was so bloated with ""DO NOT DO THIS"" and ""NEVER DO THAT"" that I think I actually confused the poor thing into submission. It was outputting pure garbage. I walked away, grabbed a coffee, and realized I was treating the LLM like a disobedient child instead of a logic engine.

I went back, deleted the entire ""Rules"" section of my prompt, and tried something I saw on a random forum. I told the model: ""Imagine you are a strict compiler. If the input doesn't map perfectly to the schema, return a null value and explain why in a separate log object. Do not apologize. Do not explain the weather. Just be a machine.""

I also added a ""Step 0"": I had it generate a schema of the CSV before it processed it.

I hit 'Run.' I held my breath.

It worked. Perfectly. 100/100 rows parsed with zero hallucinations.

It’s a humbling reminder that in prompt engineering, ""more instructions"" usually just equals ""more noise."" Sometimes you have to strip away the ""human"" pleas and just give the model a persona that has no room for error.

Has anyone else found that ""Negative Prompting"" (telling it what NOT to do) actually makes things worse for you? I feel like I just learned the hard way that less is definitely more.",2,1769604806.0,aipromptprogramming,5,1.0,False

I get up and get him out of his pajamas and put a fresh diaper on. As soon as I closed the diaper, he let out the biggest and wettest fart of his life. Okay, no big deal, you gotta go, you gotta go. I give it 30 more seconds to make sure he’s done and then go to change him. 

I got him all cleaned up and put another fresh diaper on. Before I could even close it he began pooping again. Oh my goodness. So I close it and let him finish going. It seems like he’s finally done so I open the diaper back up and go to wipe him. On the first wipe, he pooped right into my hand. It seems like he’s finally done so I clean him up and get another diaper. 

When I turned around to grab another diaper, I heard another loud fart and a splat. I turn around and oh. My. God. He had projectile shit all over the changing table and the wall. I clean it up and put the fresh diaper on and it seems like he’s done for real. I got him dressed and went to make myself coffee.

1qpae8t,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qpae8t,Dark Red Extraction Site 14 Days Later. Normal?,"I, 31M, got all 4 of my wisdom teeth out on January 14th. It’s been a miserable, awful experience. On Friday the 23rd I checked in with my dentist, and he said there’s no more dry socket risk, but it’s healing “slowly”, without being able to explain why. I’m somewhat overweight with a bit of high blood pressure, but my A1C is good and I have no other health conditions.

There was one tooth, my lower left, that was particularly deep and a bit curved. It took a while to get out and needed a little drilling. I’m concerned about how the socket for that one looks in my mouth. It appears still like a dark red. What concerns me is that there previously was granulation tissue (puffy stable white that didn’t smell), but now it’s back to this red stuff. There’s a little bit of pain, like 2-3/10, made worse by moving my mouth around it (and sleeping on that side, which I inadvisably did last night). I’ve mostly stopped with the ibuprofen just to not overload my system with it, and switched to just one 500mg Tylenol before bed. I’m eating soft (but chewable) foods like soft pasta in a cream sauce, lukewarm coffee, hummus, potatoes in blended tzatziki, etc, and brushing my teeth (but not the extraction sites) and doing a warm saltwater rinse right after I eat.

My question is: should I be concerned about how this socket looks? This level of red doesn’t seem normal for 2 weeks. My dentist on Friday said to go back in a week if things aren’t right. Is this enough of a concern by itself? Should my pain be almost gone by now?",1,1769604364.0,wisdomteeth,0,1.0,False

I assembled it on the patio. It weighed a ton. It looked rugged.

Then the first heatwave hit yesterday. I went outside with my coffee and noticed the armrests were wet. I wiped them down, assuming it was dew. I touched the liquid. It was thick, black, and smelled like a Jiffy Lube.

The casting is apparently so porous and low-quality that they didn't bother cleaning the scrap metal before melting it down. The iron is saturated with old lubricants, cutting fluids, and engine grease. Now that it’s sitting in the sun, the metal is expanding and purging decades of dirty oil out through the pores. I tried to paint over it, but the paint just slid off. I essentially bought a solidified engine block that has been molded into the shape of a Victorian loveseat.

1qpa7eu,https://www.reddit.com/r/NevilleGoddardSuccess/comments/1qpa7eu/i_escaped_a_foreign_country_with_law_of/,I escaped a foreign country with Law of Assumption only,"It was 2011. My son was eleven months old, I had just learned I was pregnant with our daughter, and I was packing up thirty-two years of my life to move to my husband’s village in Serbia.  Everyone warned me not to go. The reluctance and concern from the people I loved made me question everything, but whenever I voiced my fears to my husband, he soothed them. And so I got on a plane in December 2011, believing I was stepping into a new chapter for our little family.  We had been there only a few weeks when my husband’s other personality began to emerge. It started with small things—criticizing the way I cleaned, the way I cooked. His father came to our apartment every morning like clockwork to pick him up, and my husband wouldn’t return until late afternoon. I was in a sixth-floor walk-up with no elevator, caring for a one-year-old, pregnant, and alone every single day.  But I refused to sit inside that apartment and wither. I’d strap my baby to my body, grab our 30-pound stroller, and make the trip up and down those stairs multiple times a day. Many trips included groceries on my back, a stroller in hand, a baby on my chest, and a growing belly.  My husband and his father were opening a small burrito takeout shop in town. I tried to be supportive, but the isolation swallowed me. I began slipping into what someone would call a mild depression—something I had never known. I was always deeply spiritual, full of light, positivity. I never understood how people could fall into darkness… until it happened to me.  As the months passed, my husband grew colder and more distant. When I finally told him how I felt—that this wasn’t what I imagined and that I wanted to go home—he looked at me with eyes so cold and calculating they didn’t even seem human. He told me my children would never step foot on American soil again.  Something inside me died in that moment. I felt my life force leave my body. I thought, Oh my God, what have I done?  From that moment forward, I didn’t recognize myself. I spent the next year and a half barely surviving. My husband blew through all of my money—the savings I had brought to Serbia—and left me with nothing. We sold the apartment and moved into a house where I hoped things would improve, but they only worsened. He stopped coming home at night. He told me I was disgusting. He brought women into our basement—nothing but a mattress on the floor—and I was not allowed to question any of it.  I called family in Los Angeles constantly, sobbing that I was a prisoner in Serbia and that my children and I would never get out. I repeated that story day after day after day.  Finally, I called the American Embassy for help. They listened, they cared, and together we devised a risky plan to escape. In February 2013, in the middle of the night, I fled with my two children in a taxi, beginning the three-hour drive to Belgrade. Because the embassy wasn’t open until morning, we stopped at a small motel to wait out the night. The children slept. I couldn’t.  When we arrived at the embassy, they told me that my daughter’s American passport—scheduled to arrive the day before—still hadn’t arrived. I would need to be placed in a safe house until it was in their hands.  We were driven deep into the woods to a shelter that felt like an orphanage for broken women. Some had been stabbed by their husbands. Some beaten black and blue. Everyone worked—cooking, cleaning, organizing donations. I barely spoke the language. I was of little use to anyone.  On the second day, someone who spoke a few words of English told me I had a phone call. In a tiny office crowded with diapers, donated clothes, and boxes of food, I answered the phone. It was an attorney my mother had found—someone who specialized in international child custody and kidnapping.  She asked how long we had been in Serbia. I told her: one year and two months.  She quietly explained that because the children had been there more than a year, Serbia was now considered their habitual residence. I had no rights. If I boarded a plane with them back to California, I would be detained immediately for kidnapping, and my children would be sent back to Serbia that same day.  Again, my life force drained out of me.  I had no choice but to call my husband. A car brought us back to the embassy. My husband and his father picked us up, and I returned to the village as the most hated woman there. I was villainized, treated like a criminal. His family wouldn’t speak to me. I was more isolated than ever.  But I needed to go home, even briefly, to see my family. My husband finally agreed—but said I could take my daughter only. Not my son.  I was terrified to leave him behind, but I knew he was safe, and I was desperate to be around people who loved me. My husband encouraged me to go, pretending it would help us fall back in love and repair our marriage.  So my daughter and I flew out of Hungary and landed in LAX in the summer of 2013.  The first few days were fine—my husband and I exchanged photos of the kids, pretending everything was normal. Then, about a week into the trip, he emailed me. He wanted a divorce. I should stay in Los Angeles with our daughter, he would stay in Serbia with our son, and we would “switch children” every summer—but I would never have both of my babies at the same time again.  He said if I returned to Serbia, I was not welcome in the home I had purchased. I could find my own apartment. And still, he said, I would never have both children together.  I was at my best friend’s house when I read that email. I collapsed on her marble bathroom floor with my daughter in my arms. Her nanny ran in and took my daughter so I could fall apart. I screamed. I sobbed.  And then something happened.  A surge of energy rose up through my feet, traveled up my spine, and burst out through the crown of my head. In that moment, something ancient and powerful inside me woke up.  I thought: Oh, this is ON.  I called a friend who owned a car service for celebrities and told him I needed a job I could do overseas. Without hesitation, he said, “The job is yours.” I trained with him for a few days, shortened my trip, and flew back to Serbia. I had to get to my son.  When we returned, I went straight to my mother-in-law’s house and demanded him. My two-and-a-half-year-old baby boy came running, glued himself to me, and didn’t let go for two straight weeks. He wouldn’t let anyone else near him. It was as if he felt the gravity of everything.  My husband’s attitude shifted—suddenly he wanted me in the house again. He wanted the family together. And now that I had a well-paying job, he became his old charming self again. I was useful to him.  I stayed in the house for the children, though I slept separately. Slowly, I started to feel myself again.  And then one afternoon while I was working at my desk, I felt something—silent but strong—say, Go find the book.  I remembered that back in 2011, I had packed one box of books when we moved. I had never opened it. It was still taped shut in the basement. I went downstairs, opened it, and there it was: Ask and It Is Given by Esther Hicks. I hardly remembered buying it. I didn’t even know who Esther Hicks was at the time.  But I took the book upstairs and started reading.  Within an hour, something miraculous happened—everything spiritual I had ever known came flooding back. My I AM-ness. My connection. My power.  I was on fire.  I rode my bicycle into town, bought a journal, came home, and wrote on a tiny piece of paper:  “Me and my children will be back in the United States, living happily and peacefully, in the spring of 2014.”  And then I went all in.  I grew up in the film industry, surrounded by imagination. Make-believe was second nature. So I began using that gift in the most deliberate way I ever had. Early each morning, I went onto our deck and gave full lectures at imaginary book signings. In my mind, I had written books on how I escaped Serbia with only my consciousness. I answered questions from the audience. I saw what people were wearing. I felt the energy in the room. I got goosebumps. Highs. Knowing.  I sat at the bottom of our long driveway with my eyes closed and imagined backing the car out, leaving forever.  I hid my journal because if my husband found that note—the declaration of my escape—he would have lost his mind.  I stopped asking him to go home. I didn’t want anything to disrupt my state. As far as he knew, I was happy and planning to stay. Meanwhile, I was weaving an invisible web he would never escape.  And then, everything around him began to collapse.  Within months, his business failed. He turned to petty crime to make money, which landed him in jail for a month. He lost our car, then bought another, which turned out to be stolen. We lost that one too. Within five months, he had nothing left.  I had a front-row seat to my manifestation.  On New Year’s Eve, as I sat at my desk, he called me from a party and said, “Natalie, book a ticket for you and the kids to go home. I’ll follow behind you, but I can’t stay here anymore.”  A gentle smile crossed my face.  This was my doing. I set the intention. I saw it clearly. I held unwavering faith.  And God—my Father, my Source—worked on my behalf and orchestrated a perfect exit for everyone involved.  And here is the most extraordinary part:  Without even realizing it, the day me and my children landed at LAX was the first day of spring 2014—exactly as I had written on that tiny piece of paper.  This story is over ten years old now, and so much has unfolded since. But I want this story to go viral—not for attention, but because I want people to know how powerful they truly are.  I kept myself trapped longer than necessary because of a victim mentality. I was a broken record, constantly saying, “I’m a prisoner here. I’m never getting out.” And that is exactly what my reality reflected.  But the day I remembered who I was—everything changed.  I became free inside. And the 3D world simply caught up.  I am now working on my next big manifestation. And even though this one is not for survival; it is just as big as escaping Serbia, if not bigger. 

And I say that because I want people to know that yes, you can say manifesting something “big” is just as easy as manifesting a cup of coffee but I don’t believe that is entirely true. Some manifestations require a lot of rearranging in other people’s lives and that takes time. I can tell you other stories of big things I’ve manifested and how I did it and I can tell you that sometimes they take a year or a little bit more. I think when we read stories, especially in Neville‘s work, we think things happen in two weeks. And so if a few weeks or a few months goes by and nothing has happened and it’s radio silence we get discouraged. So I want you to know that these things can take longer than you think. But I do not believe a desire is put in your heart if it’s meant to take years and years and years. My point is, just be patient. The appointed hour will come.

 I discovered Neville when I got home and realized I had been deliberately using my imagination to create everything; I just didn’t know it was an actual  “thing” I just thought I was a little crazy lol 

The desire I hold in my mind now is already alive in consciousness, and I’m aligning with it now. Not everyone is ready for this level of work. The word delusional scares people, but you must be a little delusional to create on this level. This work doesn’t happen in the 3D. It happens in the unseen. It is faith in its purest form.

He didnt ask me or anything he just announced we were leaving and I went along with it because what else was I gonna do.

It was a really long drive and by the time we got there I was completely drained and had a headache. He told me to wait in the car because hed just be a minute dropping off the paper. I figured okay fine two minutes.

Instead I look out and see him sitting outside with his coworkers smoking and laughing. He waves me over. I was already annoyed because I told him I wanted to go home but I had to get out anyway because our cat Eloise was in the car and it was way too hot to leave her in there. First thing everyone does when they see me is stare at my belly.

I told him again that I wanted to go home. He said just wait a bit I have something to tell them lets go upstairs for coffee. I said no Im just gonna head home on my own. He laughed and said well I have the car keys. His coworkers laughed too and then he goes shes just acting like this because shes tired.
I felt so humiliated standing there in front of people I dont even know.

He pretty much made me go upstairs with him to the office kitchen where everyone was hanging out. I thought maybe he had some actual work thing to deal with but nope. It was literally just gossip about two coworkers who had some big fight and got fired.

 They were reenacting the whole thing word for word and my boyfriend was eating it up asking a million questions like what did the team lead say and what happened in the group chat after.

I was just sitting there like a prop the whole time. And the worst part was he kept handing Eloise around to whoever wanted to hold her without even checking with me first. Some girl asked if she could pet her and he just handed her over like she was his to give.

I built an app to show you how much future money you’re losing out on,"I constantly wondered to myself: what would this money look like if I hadn’t spent it? Not in a guilt trip way, but more like genuine curiosity. I did the math on my wife and I’s “treat yourself” coffee purchases and it was kind of wild. $10+ a day over a few years isn’t just a few thousand spent, it’s also the money you didn’t get the chance to compound.

That’s how I ended up building SpentWorth. You upload bank or credit card CSVs (I didn’t want to do the whole Plaid or bank login thing, and it’s surprisingly expensive to integrate as a developer), it categorizes your spending, and then shows the opportunity cost of purchases based on an investment return assumption with real historical values.

For example, it will take a DoorDash transaction or a Netflix subscription, and show what that same amount could have grown to over 5, 10, or 20 years if it had been invested instead. I have a demo version to walk through all of this.

It’s not meant to shame anyone. Sometimes the convenience is absolutely worth it. For me, it just made certain “invisible” spending stand out so I could tighten up a bit without feeling like I was depriving myself. None of the budgeting apps out there, that I am aware of, directly show you your opportunity cost nor encourage you to change your habits, they only show if you met your budgeting goals.

There’s a free tier that covers the basics, plus an optional roughly $5 per month plan if you want more features.

Site: https://spentworth.com

I’d really love feedback from anyone willing to take a quick look:

•	⁠Does the opportunity cost framing feel helpful or?

•	⁠What would you want to see first after uploading, top merchants, top categories, subscriptions, or something else?

•	⁠How often would you realistically upload CSVs, weekly, monthly, or just occasionally?

•	⁠What is the biggest thing that would prevent you from using something like this again?

•	⁠What feature would make this feel worth opening regularly?

Thank you for reading our **Java Burn review** ...

Some mornings you feel like a soggy piece of toast—warm, useless, and just waiting to be rescued by coffee. Been there. It’s exhausting, physically and mentally.

Tired of energy crashes, random cravings, and a waistband that’s clinging on for dear life? That’s where [Java Burn steps in](https://theworldhealth.org/morning-coffee-ritual-official)—with zero flavor and, thankfully, zero drama.

# 📦 Product Overview

**Product Name:** Java Burn

**Overall Verdict:** 4.8/5

# 🔍 What is Java Burn & How Does It Work?

**Java Burn** is a **fat burning coffee powder** that blends invisibly into your morning cup. It supports fat loss, energy, and focus—all without adding calories.

It claims to **increase metabolism naturally** by working with your coffee’s caffeine, not against it. Think of it as a co-pilot, not a replacement.

Unlike pills or flavored drinks, this is a **healthy coffee enhancer** that won’t mess with your brew. It doesn’t clump, doesn’t float, and doesn’t judge your coffee habits.

This isn’t just one of the **best supplements to mix with coffee**, it might be the only one you’ll finish the pouch off without regret.

It’s marketed as a **coffee metabolism booster supplement** that makes your cup do more than just wake you up. And it actually follows through.

# 👤 Personal Experience with Java Burn (from Lisa)

Lisa and I used to share a co-working space back when I was freelancing full-time—she’s a freelance UX designer and full-blown coffee snob with a side hustle teaching yoga.

We bonded over burnt espresso shots and long rants about slow metabolism after 30.

She was the one who nudged me [toward Java Burn](https://theworldhealth.org/morning-coffee-ritual-official). “It’s not a miracle,” she warned, “but it *does* help me stay out of the snack drawer between client calls.”

Lisa started mixing **Java Burn** into her morning pour-over during a particularly intense stretch of back-to-back deadlines.

After about four days, she noticed her energy stayed more even—no 3 p.m. crashes, and her usual impulse to stress-eat a granola bar? MIA.

She didn’t change anything else—same yoga classes, same avocado toast obsession—but over the next month, she said her leggings started feeling just a bit looser. Nothing drastic, just a steady shift.

“It’s the first time I’ve lost weight without feeling like I was punishing myself,” she said, which coming from Lisa, is high praise.

Her only gripe? On mornings she skipped breakfast (usually after a late night prototyping marathon), it made her feel a bit too wired. Once she paired it with even a small snack, things leveled out fast.

So yeah—real person, real coffee, real results.

It’s perfect if you already drink coffee and want to **boost metabolism with your morning brew**—without adding another pill to your routine.

If you're after a **metabolism booster without jitters**, though, you’ll want to pair it with food. Caffeine still hits hard on an empty stomach.

One reviewer said it helped them **burn fat faster by making coffee more effective**, and that matches what Lisa and I noticed too.

It's a popular **coffee fat burner supplement** without any of the usual chemical nonsense.

# 🧯 How to Use It (Properly)

Use one packet a day, ideally with hot coffee and a little food. It dissolves fast and plays nice with any roast—light, dark, or ""I slept three hours.""

It's [super convenient](https://theworldhealth.org/morning-coffee-ritual-official) and definitely one of the **best weight loss powders to mix with coffee** ... it actually delivers on its promise. Skip the food and it might punch a little too hard.

Wondering **how to make coffee burn fat faster**? Stir in Java Burn consistently, stay active, and don’t chase it with a muffin the size of your head.

# ⚠️ Side Effects & Safety Notes

Let’s keep it real. There *are* possible **Java Burn side effects**—mainly jitters or a slight crash if you’re sensitive or forget to eat.

That said, most users who already drink coffee daily are fine. Just don't chug it like a frat boy with pre-workout and you’ll be good.

# 💸 Pricing Options

* **1 pouch (30-day supply):** $69
* **3 pouches:** $117 ($39 each)

1qpa3sr,https://www.reddit.com/r/istanbul_tips/comments/1qpa3sr/how_i_actually_shop_in_istanbul_eminönü_tahtakale/,"How I Actually Shop in Istanbul: Eminönü, Tahtakale, and What I Learned","https://preview.redd.it/yrftp4os33gg1.png?width=1585&format=png&auto=webp&s=0455255a0ae59918c896cba19d15f48e97975fee

Next up is Tahtakale and the local markets around Eminönü. These are places mostly visited by locals, and for some reason, many tourists completely miss them. If you’re not obsessed with brands, you’ll find bags, shoes, and clothes at prices that honestly feel unreal. Some shops are hidden inside old passages. Phone accessories, affordable tech, random useful stuff… you can find almost everything in Tahtakale and Eminönü.

This map shows an area where about 95 percent of the shops sell phone accessories and mobile-related products:  
[https://yandex.com.tr/maps/115707/fatih/?ll=28.968479%2C41.016185&z=21]()

Another key location is here:  
[https://yandex.com.tr/maps/11508/istanbul/house/hasircilar\_cad\_no\_25c/ZkEYfwFpTUACQFprfXxwdnxkYw==/?ll=28.969979%2C41.016675&z=18.47]()

Power banks, phone cases, chargers, basically anything phone-related is sold here. There are dozens of shops selling very similar items, so be selective. Ask prices, compare, and buy from whoever gives you the best deal. And remember, just because you enter a shop doesn’t mean you owe them a purchase.

Another well-known place in Eminönü is Dogubank. I’ll be honest, I’ve become a bit hesitant about recommending it lately. I’ve had a few bad experiences there, and I can’t fully explain why, but I feel cautious. Still, I don’t want to hide it from you.

Dogubank is a large building with four or five floors, each packed with shops. Lower floors are mostly phone sellers and accessory stores. Upper floors have branded eyewear shops, computer repair services, and tech stores. Once, someone tried to sell me a device that supposedly gave unlimited lifetime access to Netflix and hundreds of paid apps when plugged into a TV. I didn’t really understand how it worked, so I skipped it.

After my phone was damaged, it stopped turning on. Dogubank was recommended to me. I was called to pick it up after repair, but it shut down again on my way home and never turned back on. The repair guy said he fixed it and refused responsibility. This happened twice at the same place. That’s probably why I’m cautious. I left disappointed. I still mention Dogubank because it’s not only phone repair shops. There are many tech and eyewear stores, and maybe it’s useful for you to walk around for a few minutes.

Another place I recommend is Şarkhan in Tahtakale. It’s like an old-school mall with about five or six floors. Each floor has dozens of shops selling mainly gift items. Locals often come here for weddings, engagements, home decorations, and special occasions. Prices are competitive because of the location.

When I went to Şarkhan, I was looking for a few souvenirs before leaving Istanbul. I wanted to buy small gifts for people close to me. Some shops had wooden educational toys, and I bought one for my little cousin. You can easily explore the building from bottom to top. It’s usually not overcrowded, and I’m sure you’ll find something useful. Location here:  
[https://share.google/fOs294eZZGEKu2yTN](https://share.google/fOs294eZZGEKu2yTN)

For clothes and fashion, this is the exact area:  
[https://yandex.com.tr/maps/11508/istanbul/house/hasircilar\_cad\_no\_25c/ZkEYfwFpTUACQFprfXxwdnxkYw==/?ll=28.969979%2C41.016675&z=18.47]()

Shoes, clothes, all kinds of fashion items are sold around here. You can bargain and get good deals. Streets on the right, left, behind… dozens of sellers everywhere. And yes, it’s crowded.

There’s also a short street packed only with bag and clothing shops:  
[https://yandex.com.tr/maps/11508/istanbul/house/hasircilar\_cad\_no\_25c/ZkEYfwFpTUACQFprfXxwdnxkYw==/?ll=28.969979%2C41.016675&z=18.47]()

I once bought a vintage-style bag for 1000 TL in a touristy area and later saw the same kind here for 300 TL. You can imagine how that felt.

All these places are in the same Eminönü and Tahtakale area. If you don’t like crowds, go early, around 9, 10, or 11 in the morning. After noon, locals flood the area and it can get overwhelming. Pay attention to your belongings. Nobody is trying to harm you, but crowds are crowds. Avoid carrying valuables if you can. Just enjoy the experience.

If you want to buy Turkish coffee, this is the place:  
[https://google.com/maps/@41.0165152,28.9702839,3a,75y,295.37h,119.1t](https://google.com/maps/@41.0165152,28.9702839,3a,75y,295.37h,119.1t)

This is Kurukahveci Mehmet Efendi. Everyone comes here to buy Turkish coffee, not to sit and drink, but to take it home. I went there three times in one day. On my third visit, I noticed the line was always the same length, so I waited. Clearly, a lot of people think it’s worth it. The only downside is the line. The coffee is genuinely excellent.

Some personal notes. Make a shopping list before coming here. If you just wander around, you’ll get exhausted fast. You can find everything, but navigating through the crowd is a workout. Afternoon visits require patience and balance.

About shop workers, there’s no single rule. Some are friendly, some are distant. That’s normal everywhere. Asking for a price doesn’t mean you’re committing to buy. Don’t hesitate. I asked plenty of questions on purpose and survived. Check quality before buying. Inspect clothes and bags carefully. For tech, make sure the packaging hasn’t been opened. Bargaining is expected. Prices usually include a margin for negotiation.

To get here from Sultanahmet, take the T1 tram from Sultanahmet stop, ride three stops, and get off at Eminönü. Walk away from the seaside, not toward it. The links I shared are enough for navigation.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1qp9yaw,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheOdetteApp/comments/1qp9yaw/when_selfcare_gets_too_loud/,When Self-Care Gets Too Loud,"https://preview.redd.it/7vpnbcng23gg1.jpg?width=1400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d6af35b5484a27398adc8cf176e09513d5452f04

At some point, self-care stopped being caring. It became loud.  
  
Open any app and someone is telling you what you should be doing:

Wake up earlier.  
Drink more water.  
Stop drinking coffee.  
Add magnesium.  
Lift heavy.  
Stretch daily.  
Oil pull.  
Double cleanse.  
Absolutely do not skip sunscreen.  
Also, don’t forget your neck and hands!  
  
It’s not that any of this advice is bad. It’s that all of it is yelling at you at the same time.  
  
**The modern woman is drowning in instructions**  
  
Every corner of the internet has an opinion about how to live your life better: Wellness. Productivity. Beauty. Health. Mental health. Hormones. Longevity.  
  
Each voice is confident.  
Each voice is urgent.  
Each voice is convinced this is the missing piece.  
  
*So you listen. You save the post. You bookmark the video. You screenshot the routine. You buy the product. And slowly, quietly, something shifts.*  
  
Not inspiration. Pressure.  
  
**When good advice becomes noise**  
  
Advice is supposed to help you move forward. But when there’s too much of it, you stop moving at all.  
  
You don’t know where to start.  
You don’t know what matters today.  
You don’t know which rules apply to you.  
  
So instead of feeling supported, you feel managed.  
  
Your body becomes a project.  
Your routines become obligations.  
Your mirror becomes a checklist you’re already failing.  
  
No one tells you this part.  
  
**The invisible weight of “should”**  
  
Every “should” adds weight.  
  
You should be doing more.  
You should be consistent.  
You should want this badly enough to follow through.  
  
*When you don’t, the conclusion is never “this system is flawed.”*  
*It’s always, “what’s wrong with me?”*  
  
So you try again.  
And again.  
And again.  
  
Different advice. Same outcome.  
  
**This is not a discipline problem**  
  
*Women are not failing because they lack willpower. They are failing because they are being pulled in too many directions by too many voices.*  
  
Routines are built as if life is quiet.  
As if energy is unlimited.  
As if interruptions don’t exist.  
  
As if there is one right way to do things, and everyone else has already figured it out.  
  
That version of life is fictional.  
  
**The moment advice turns into avoidance**  
  
Eventually, the noise becomes so loud that you shut it all out.  
  
You stop watching.  
You stop experimenting.  
You stop trying.  
  
*Not because you don’t care. But because caring has become overwhelming.*  
  
Self-care becomes something you’ll “get back to” when life calms down. Spoiler: it never does.  
  
**What women actually need**  
  
Women do not need more tips.  
They do not need louder voices.  
They do not need another expert shouting from the sidelines.  
  
They need:  
  
Fewer decisions at once  
Clear sequences instead of endless options  
Permission to return without starting over  
A way forward that doesn’t punish inconsistency  
They need space to breathe.  
  
They need one calm voice saying:  
“This is enough for today.”  
  
*Beauty and care should feel like guidance, not pressure*  
  
Ritual is quiet.  
Ritual is grounding.  
Ritual meets you where you are — not where you should be.  
  
If you’ve ever felt overwhelmed by advice that was meant to help…  
If you’ve ever felt exhausted before a routine even began…  
If you’ve ever wondered why self-care feels harder than it should…  
  
You are not broken.  
  
You’re just tired of being yelled at.",2,1769603087.0,TheOdetteApp,0,1.0,False

I’m 26 and I spend most of my time looking at the world through a lens or a screen. I’m a photographer and graphic designer, which basically means I’m obsessed with aesthetics, lighting, and storytelling.
But enough about work I’m here because I miss those genuine, ""talk about everything and nothing"" kind of connections. I’m a big fan of deep conversations, obscure art, and finding beauty in the most random places.
A bit more about me:
 I can spend hours arguing about why a specific shade of blue is better than another.
 I love capturing moments that feel like they belong in a movie.
 I probably have a playlist for every possible mood.
 Coffee is my fuel, but a good conversation is what actually keeps me going.
What I’m looking for:
I don’t care where you’re from or what you do, as long as you’re down for some real talk. Tell me about your passion, your favorite travel spot, or even a weird hobby you have.
Slide into my DMs with your favorite photo you’ve ever taken (even if it’s just a blurry cat pic lol) or tell me a song that’s been on repeat for you lately.
