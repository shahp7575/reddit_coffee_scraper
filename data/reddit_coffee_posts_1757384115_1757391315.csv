1nc9atf,https://i.redd.it/o2ttcc3yd2of1.jpeg,"Looking for:  ""Her Pregnancy Trap"" — The husband seemed to be a good one in this story, I badly want to read it. 🙏🏻","Hi! I'm so invested in this story, the husband seems to be a green flag and I want to read how this one ends. Does anyone know a free link for this, please? 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻

Chapter 1
Over dinner, I was scrolling through X when a post stopped me cold.

[I’m pregnant and want my best friend’s husband to take responsibility as the dad. What should I do?]

I was about to type that the poster was out of her mind, but the replies were worse.

[It’s easy. If you’re close with the couple, just invite them on a trip.]

[Get them drunk at night, then ‘accidentally’ end up in her husband’s room. Boom, done.]

[Afterward, show him a positive test and pressure him to step up and claim the baby…]

I let out a disbelieving laugh, heat prickling under my skin. I was about to send the post to my best friend so we could roast it when Sarah looked up from her plate.

“Hey, Lily, you free this weekend?” she asked. “How about a trip?”

I froze.

“A trip?” I raised a brow. “Where did that come from? Isn’t a weekend kind of rushed?”

Sarah and I had been friends since college. We usually planned trips over long breaks; this was out of the blue, and two days barely covered the travel time.

She grinned like it was nothing. “I was just scrolling X and saw there’s an EDM festival in Las Vegas this weekend. Come on, Lily—we haven’t had fun in forever. Work’s been grinding us down. Let’s blow off some steam.”

I hesitated, nudging my food around. “I don’t know… Let me think it over tonight,” I said after a beat. “I don’t have plans this weekend, but I promised Ethan I’d run things by him. He gets anxious if I don’t.”

At the mention of my husband, Sarah’s eyes lit for a split second. Then she flashed a bright smile. “Easy fix—bring Ethan. It’ll be even safer with him there.”

Before I could answer, she pulled out her phone and opened Ticketmaster.

Unease slid under my ribs. A trip. The three of us. The timing. It looked a little too much like that post.

I watched Sarah tapping away, her face bright with excitement. A wild thought flickered: What if she was the one who posted it?

I shook my head at myself. No way. The world wasn’t that small. We’d been friends for five years. I knew her. She wouldn’t do something like that.

I took a breath, talked myself down, and told her to go ahead and buy the tickets.

A minute later, Sarah excused herself to the bathroom. As she stood, a waiter carrying a tray came up beside her. She didn’t see him, and they collided.

My heart stopped for a beat.

Sarah’s hands flew to her belly, shielding it on instinct.

A chill raced over my skin.

Was Sarah… pregnant?

Was she really the one who wrote that post?

Chapter 2
As soon as Sarah slipped away to the bathroom, I seized the chance to open the post I’d been reading. The original poster had updated it only seconds earlier.

[Score — I got her to agree! I told her to bring her husband, and she didn’t hesitate to say yes. Lucky we were so close—she didn’t suspect a thing. ]

My stomach dropped.

I scrolled down and saw a handful of new replies. After Sarah’s comment, the people who had been quietly following the thread finally spoke up. Several jumped in and tore into her.

“[ou’re supposed to be her friend, and you’re scheming like this? Are you even human?]

[Running into someone like you is the worst luck. I hope your friend sees this and learns who you really are. Gross.]

[Don’t push this kind of trash my way again — I’m so mad I’m going to get an ulcer! Dumbass!]

But the poster didn’t flinch; she shot back at every critic.

[You weren’t in my shoes. If you were, you’d have done the same thing.]

[I just can’t stand it. Why should some small-town nobody get to marry a city guy? She’s not as pretty as me, her family isn’t as good as mine—how is she worthy of her husband?]

[Anyway, I’m going to ruin her. If I can’t have what I want, she doesn’t get to live happily either. I can’t wait to see her face when her husband betrays her.]

[Haha, it’ll be epic. She’ll end up alone and unwanted.]

The more I read, the colder the room felt. There was no denying it—this poster was Sarah.

She had said it herself: I’d come from a small town. I was the only kid from my hometown who’d made it to college.

That background had left me feeling inferior through university; I’d kept to myself and didn’t have many friends.

Sarah had been the one who reached out—the one who stuck with me through freshman year, through graduation, and into these early years at work. I’d trusted her more than anyone.

I hadn’t expected her to be capable of something so dark. That she could look down on me and want to destroy my happiness—knowing all that—felt like a punch to the ribs.

My hands began to tremble around the phone.

Sarah stopped replying to the commenters. I realized she might be coming back.

I shoved the phone into my pocket, drew a slow breath, and smoothed my expression until it was neutral. I’d made up my mind. I wasn’t just going to decline her weekend invitation—I was done with her. For good.

She returned from the bathroom and slid back into her seat across from me, smiling.

“Lily, I already bought your ticket. I just need your husband’s email for his e-ticket and I’ll buy his now. Don’t worry about the cost — I’ve got it covered. Consider it my treat for you two coming with me.”

Her smile was bright. To me, it looked like a challenge, sharp at the edges.

I swallowed the anger bubbling beneath my ribs and forced my voice calm. “Sarah, you should refund the ticket. I’m not going.”

“What?” Her voice shot up before I could finish, loud enough that a few heads turned. She coughed and softened it immediately. “I mean… what? You’re bailing now? That’s so sudden.”

I put on an apologetic look.

“Sorry, I thought about it. The timing’s tight, and I’ve got a huge project that’s piling up — I’ll probably need to work through the weekend. Let’s plan a paid vacation later, when things settle down. For now, maybe find someone else to go with.”

Her smile dropped. Irritation slipped over her face. “But we already agreed. I bought the ticket, Lily. You can’t just back out now—that’s unfair.”

“I don’t care,” she added quickly, like a petulant command. “You’re coming with me this weekend, no excuses.”

In the past, whenever Sarah sulked or threw a fit, I had always been the one to give in.

If she wanted something, I found a way to make it happen; she was my best friend, after all. Now, knowing what I knew, I felt foolish for five years.

I forced a bitter little smile and kept eating, eyes on my plate.

Sarah fidgeted, anxious at my silence. She opened her mouth to say more, but I grabbed a napkin, wiped my lips, and stood up before she could speak.

“Sorry, Sarah, it’s getting late. My husband’s waiting for me. I have to go.” I offered a conciliatory smile. “I’ll make it up to you next time.”

I didn’t wait for her response. I turned and walked out—quick, deliberate steps—and I didn’t look back at her expression.

When I got home and opened X, a notification popped up: Sarah had posted again.

Chapter 3
I stared at my phone, thumb hovering, as Sarah’s latest post blew up with comments.

She’d posted that she’d backed out and was begging for help — the kind of panicked post that begged attention.

Underneath the flood of replies, one commenter stood out: the same person who’d given advice earlier.

The person asked, bluntly, whether Sarah really needed her best friend to step in this time. Couldn’t she find someone else?

Sarah’s answer landed like a blow. She wrote that there was no way — she was going to steal her friend’s husband.

She said she wanted to ruin her happiness.

She went on: at lunch that day the woman had kept bringing up her husband, and it had made Sarah sick. She wanted to see her cry, to watch her break.

My stomach turned. Whatever thin strand of affection I’d still had for my so-called best friend snapped in that instant.

Then the commenter went quiet. A minute later I noticed they’d taken the thread to private messages.

After my shower I checked Sarah’s post again. Her tone had flipped to smug. [It’s done,] she’d written. [I got her. I’ll bring good news to you all this weekend.]

Confusion prickled at me — had she switched targets?

Before I could sort it out, my phone started buzzing. A dozen Messenger notifications from Ethan. I’d been so wrapped up in Sarah’s feed that I hadn’t noticed.

I opened the chat. He’d sent a screenshot with a string of messages: [Babe, what’s going on? Why’s Sarah asking me for my email?]

[She said you wanted to go to the EDM festival — is that true? You didn’t reply and she kept harassing me, so I gave it to her.]

……

I felt cold. Sarah had gone around me and messaged Ethan directly — and she’d lied. I was furious.

I was about to call him and demand answers when I heard the front door open. Ethan was home.

I didn’t try to hide it. “Why would you agree to anything she said without checking with me first?” I asked in the living room.

He looked surprised and a little wounded. “You always trusted her, didn’t you?” he said.

“Sometimes it feels like you two are the couple, not us. You always take her side. She was blowing up my phone and you weren’t answering, so I figured it was okay.”

His words stung, but they weren’t wrong.

For five years I’d trusted Sarah blindly. When we traveled she’d set the budget and I’d Venmo her without question. At work, if she wanted a project I’d give it up without complaint just to keep the peace.

Thinking back on all those small concessions, I felt my stomach churn again — maybe my blind trust had made her feel she could do anything.

I told Ethan everything: the post, the hateful things she’d written, that she seemed intent on destroying us.

His face darkened with each detail. Without hesitation he pulled out his phone and blocked Sarah in front of me.

“If it wasn’t for you, I wouldn’t even have her contact,” he said, jaw tight.

“Tell her the festival’s off. I’m done with her. And you…” His gaze softened but stayed firm. “You’ve seen who she really is now. Stay away from her. No more contact.”

I nodded. My resolve hardened.

I opened my messages to Sarah and sent a short, final reply: [I wasn’t going.]

She answered immediately, slipping into her usual act.

[Lily, please,] she wrote. [I’m desperate. I can’t go alone. I just wanted Ethan to talk you into coming — the three of us would have fun. I couldn’t find anyone else. Come on, have a heart.]

I scoffed, my patience gone. I blocked her back.

The next morning at work, my boss, Luke Connor called everyone together and announced, casually, “Heads up — we have a team-building retreat this Friday and Saturday.”

Chapter 4
At first, I didn’t think much of it. Last week Luke had mentioned a company team-building outing. I just hadn’t expected it to fall on Friday and Saturday of the same week.

When Luke briefly described the destination, he flashed a grin. “We’re going to a resort this time,” he said. “We’ll be teamed up with another department for the activities.”

He chuckled. “The company doesn’t have an explicit policy forbidding office romances, so if you’ve got your eye on someone in another department, this is a good chance to mix and meet.”

Then he looked at me. “Lily, you’re lucky — you can go with your husband and take a company-paid trip.”

His words made me frown. I couldn’t help glancing at Sarah Mitchell, my so-called best friend. She was already looking back. In that instant our eyes locked and I saw a flash of smug satisfaction, as if she’d just pulled off some elaborate scheme.

No way. Could she have had something to do with pairing my husband’s department with ours?

After Luke finished and everyone returned to their desks, I opened the thread I hadn’t checked in a couple of days. Nearly five hundred new comments had been posted.

I scrolled through them, my anger building with every line. People were offering advice.

[If they’re not willing to go, find a way to make them have to,] one commenter said.

Another wrote, [Tell us more about your situation and I’ll help you come up with a plan.]

Sarah had laid out the details.

[We work in the same company and same department,] she wrote. [Her husband is in a different department. The company is planning a team-building event — could that be my chance?]

The thread exploded. [Yes! Absolutely!] someone answered. [Team-building is perfect. Everyone will know if you hook up — how could he not take responsibility after that?]

[But team-building is so random,] Sarah worried in the thread. [There will be tons of people and departments — I might not even get a chance to talk to him…]

[Don’t be dense,] another commenter shot back. [Team-building events are organized by someone. Find out who’s in charge of arranging groups and cozy up to them. See if you can get put in the same group.]

To break the ice, the company randomly pairs two departments to form a team each time, competing against other departments in team vs. team games during corporate events.

I kept scrolling until I hit Sarah’s follow-ups.

[Thanks, babes!] she wrote. [I tracked down the HR person organizing the event and brought her a coffee. I said there was someone I liked in that department and asked if she could pair us together — she said yes!]

A moment later she added, [Plan is moving along. Just got word — I’m in the same group as her husband’s department! Wait for my good news, everyone!]

Sarah was humming a cheerful tune across the room, completely oblivious to the storm boiling inside me. A cold fury settled over me.

I stood up and marched to Luke’s office. “Luke,” I said, forcing my voice steady, “can I skip this team-building event?”

Chapter 5
Luke shot down my request without hesitation. He even sent a announcement stressing that everyone had to attend the team-building retreat unless they had a valid reason.

With no other choice, I reluctantly agreed.

On Friday morning, we left the office. Once we arrived at the retreat, everyone headed straight to the hotel to check into their rooms. Ethan and I were assigned to the same room.

After dropping off our luggage, I stepped out and almost ran into Sarah Mitchell.

She was standing outside my door, fixated on the room number. The moment she noticed me, she quickly looked away, then brightened and grabbed my hand.

“Lily, are you still mad at me?” she pouted playfully. “I messed up, okay? Can you forgive me?”

Ever since I’d blocked her, Sarah had been clinging to me at work, constantly trying to smooth things over. The second we got off the bus today, she’d rushed over, apologizing nonstop.

If I didn’t soften, I worried she’d start sensing something was off.

So I turned my head, pretending to still be upset. “So you finally admit you were wrong?”

Seeing me soften, Sarah seized the moment. “I swear I didn’t mean it! I just really wanted to go.”

“I won’t push you anymore,” she added quickly. “If you don’t want to, that’s fine.”

I sighed heavily, pretending to give in reluctantly. “Fine. But there better not be a next time.”

Sarah nodded eagerly, her face lighting up.

Then came her real agenda.

She leaned in closer, her voice soft and almost pitiful.

“Since you’ve forgiven me, Lily… can we sleep in the same room tonight? I’ve never been good at sleeping alone, and you barely talked to me these past few days. Just keep me company, okay?”

Her grip on my arm was gentle but persuasive.

But my mind was elsewhere, replaying the post I’d just seen. Earlier in the room, I’d opened the app and noticed Sarah had posted an update:

[Just arrived at the retreat! What should I do next? Any advice?]

Some creep online had replied:

[Is your bestie sharing a room with her husband? If so, find an excuse to get her to sleep with you instead.]

[That way, you can separate them. Get everyone drunk tonight, and when no one’s paying attention, sneak into her husband’s room. That’ll do the trick. After that, it’s all up to you!]

Sarah had eagerly liked the comment and even promised a cash reward if the plan worked.

Sure enough, not long after, she appeared at my door—first softening me with apologies, then moving straight to her scheme.

Meeting her pleading gaze, a sudden idea sparked in my mind. If Sarah was willing to throw away our friendship and ruin my happiness, I’d make her taste regret herself.

I kept my expression calm, though inside I was smirking. I placed my hand over hers and patted it lightly. “Alright,” I said softly. “We can sleep in the same room tonight.”

“Really?!” Sarah’s eyes lit up. She hadn’t expected such an easy agreement.

She chattered excitedly as we headed downstairs together. On the hotel patio, everyone had gathered for a barbecue.

My eyes scanned the crowd and landed on a greasy, pot-bellied man in the corner—Timmy Brooks.

Timmy was a colleague from my department.

Older, unkempt, and with a reputation for harassing younger women, he’d made several uncomfortable advances toward Sarah. She’d once complained that his leering gaze made her skin crawl.

In my book, Timmy was trouble.

Just an hour ago, he’d approached me about swapping rooms.

“Lily, you and Ethan are sharing a room, right? Any chance you could switch with me?”

I frowned. “Why? Is something wrong with your room? Can’t you just ask the front desk?”

He scratched his greasy hair awkwardly.

“Nah… it’s too big. I prefer smaller rooms, but the front desk says they’re out. No one else wants to swap with me. But you and Ethan? That big room’s perfect for you two, right?”

At the time, we’d turned him down.

But now? Things had changed.

Let the creeps sort it out among themselves, I thought. I wanted to see Sarah’s face when she woke up in Timmy’s bed.

So I walked over to Timmy, flashing a friendly smile. “Hey, Tim, still want to swap rooms? I talked it over with Ethan, and we’re fine with it.”",1,1757391264.0,novelsfree,0,1.0,False

1nc96uj,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1nc96uj/the_dream_of_endless_golden_crosses_part_2/,The Dream of Endless Golden Crosses. Part 2,"Chapter 2:

Standing before the heart of the city, I stared into the golden glow of our fake sun. But it wasn't a ball of light when I first thought, the light goes on seemingly forever to each side. It's hard to tell if it's a mighty wall to protect what's inside, or a dome to keep something from escaping. It didn't stop me from entering nor leaving, the blinding light creates a challenge for the seeing if that's what counts as it's way to stop those who dares approach. Regardless of my sight or what this brilliant glow intends, I venture towards where my city should be. My footsteps were loud, being left in a deaf world makes creaks and rustle sound like thunder and earthquakes. My heartbeat was calm, beating like it should. But each pump feels like it could shake the world if the rhythm goes off even by a second. Even my breathing feels like it doesn't belong outside my lungs, my breath sounds like a hurricane ready to destroy no matter how slow I tried to exhale. I ponder if I should hold my breath but I do not believe in my ability to hold it so I tried everything I can to keep the storm calm with normal slow breathing. Giving up on my eyes to comprehend this strange world, I make my way towards the city center with the help of my hands. Hands with limited reach compared to the gift eyes give us every day that are taken for granted, feeling nothing till my eyes become of use when they make out an odd shape. It was a large shape, standing tall over my stature with ease. Even though this giant shape has been bathed in this warm fake sunlight, it feels cold when my outstretched hands close in. Mere steps away from one of the many questions I pondered, I can now confidently say what this strange shape truly is that has been plaguing my mind since the moment I first placed my eyes of its blurry misshapen form from afar. 
What stands before me is a golden cross.

*Gasp!!!* I woke up and shot straight up in my bed, covered in sweat and panting like I was holding my breath. 
“Another nightmare?!” I sat in my bed, pondering what had been haunting me last night. I was shaking with my hands holding my head, unable to think of what scared me other than I was scared. I need to get up and get ready, but I don't want to. There's been days, most days where I don't want to go but reason won me over. Today fear is winning me to stay still and not leave, I look at my clock that now says 7:34. I could easily make it if I get out now, but I don't want to. A memory of Rachel warm welcoming smile popped into mind, washing away any fear and doubt I had. Finding a reason to go to work, I got out of bed slower than usual. My morning went by quicker and in a total blur, I headed to the bathroom, shower, brushed my teeth, dress, ate breakfast and got ready to leave. I check my clock again which now says 8:06, I can still make it just fine. I took a second to reach for the door knob, not wanting to leave the safe place I needed to keep away the nightmare. I grabbed the door knob, and walked out into the new day, or into hell.
Walking down the familiar street I known felt wrong, as if I were being watch from the shadow. I feel exposed, I want to turn back and hide under the sheets of my bed, I don't want to be outside. I feel like there's hundreds of eyes on me and I hate it. I quicken my pace away from what hell is out here when my city should be. I might be going crazy now, I thought I saw a glow behind the buildings. That doesn’t matter now, Random Shack is up ahead, I went into a dash as fast as I could to go to my second home where I could hide away from the terror of which I neither know nor wish to know. Just a few more steps, just within reach, I reached for the door and forced myself inside and shut the door behind me and held it shut so nothing could come after me.
 “Oh? Good morning Ethan! Quit the entrance today. Are you that excited for work that you ran all the way here? Or do you think sprinting to work till get you that employee of the month?” Rachel said cheerfully after being surprised from my sudden entrance. I didn’t hear her greeting, more like I couldn’t. I stood there trying to catch my breath and with the pounding of my heart made it impossible to hear anything, and honestly I really didn’t want to hear. 
“Ethan?” Rachel asked but to no answer. Failing to calm myself, the fear that was outside continued as I forced the door behind me to stay closed even harder the more I thought about it. Beads of sweat now falling off my chin then to the floor where I stared, now fearing that something might crash through the doors where I stood now became a greater concern. Legs feeling like jello and needing to run again crept into my mind, now begging to run away was what my entire body was shouting at me to do. I closed my eyes tightly, seeking courage to let go of the closed door and make a run for it, getting a last few quick breaths in for my mad escape before suddenly…..
“Ethan!?” Rachel asked again while putting her hand on my shoulder. I open my eyes to see Rachel right in front of me. It was so warm and soothing for her to be so close to me, probably the only other time she was this close besides when we first met and I shook her hand. Staring right into her beautiful blue eyes washed away any fear I had brought with me into the store. After what anyone would agree to be way too long to be staring at anyone, I regained my consciousness which felt like I had lost since yesterday and finally answered the concerned women right in front of me.
“...Oh, s-sorry. Yeah. I’m fine, just. Had a bad morning, that’s all. I-I’m fine, really, sorry for worrying you.” I’ve said the most amount of words to Rachel in one go the entire time I’ve known her, and slowly let go of the door with aching hands relieved to do so.
“Alright, if you say so. Must be a terrible start to your day, then. You’re pale as a ghost and sweating like crazy. Either you saw a ghost, or you realized you were going to be late and were about to ruin your perfect attendance.” Rachel said, trying to cheer me up, and it worked. I don’t think there’s much she could do to make me feel worse than just a few moments ago.
“Everything alright over there? I heard the door being slam shut, and it’s way too early for that to be an angry customer storming out just yet.” Rick asked and he made his way from the back towards us.
“Ethan saw a ghost, or maybe he found a bug in his coffee? The scared little guy hasn’t said much, but I can’t help but to worry about what had spooked him this badly. He didn’t seem like the type to be scared this bad.” said Rachel.
“Well it is true that you didn’t show up like usual, but you never really showed up looking like you found $20 on the street. Tell you what, you can grab one of my snacks from my secret stash and you can have 5 extra minutes on your break!” Said Rick now trying to cheer me up. Not nearly as effective as Rachel, but I still appreciate it.
“Well aren't you lucky! Well, besides the whole having a not so pleasant morning, but Rick always has the best snacks. Maybe I should show up like you did to get me some free snacks! Everyone knows that college kids run off of snacks, coffee, and the cheapest meal plans we can find.” Rachel said like her usual cheerful self. 
“Let me know if you need anything. And take it easy, it’s best if you put what happened earlier behind you. Ok!?” Realising that not only that I haven’t moved from the same spot this entire conversation, but this is also the longest I had ever been in a conversation. Still be it her doing most of it, but progress. Both Rick and Rachel headed to where they are needed, leaving me alone at the door made the isolation feel worse than ever. That fear never left, making it hard to do anything. I don’t know how long or how I even did it, I made it behind the register. I felt better by being in a place I know quite well for a little bit, but being left alone with nothing but your thoughts and fears didn’t make being here any better. 
Opening the store and letting the early birds in as usual, but I couldn’t recognize anyone coming into the store. I couldn’t make out anyone, everyone’s face and body just looked like messed mashed blobs with no color to them. I tried to look for the two people I knew but they were nowhere to be found in the sea of colorless shaped and distorted voices. I didn’t know if I was working or doing anything, everything just went by so fast that I really couldn’t comprehend if anything happened or not. I stared out into the store with passing blurs going in and out, trying to grasp onto anything that I could understand but I always end up at the same isolated spot where I sat as everything at the store moves on without me. The buzz above me was loud, louder then ever. It sounds more like the screams of the damn, I might actually be in hell right now. I was going insane but I didn’t say a word. I don’t know if it was either because I didn't want disturbed what’s normal left of the store, or if I physically couldn’t. What felt like seconds to minutes passed, I felt like something within me was about to snap when-
“Alright, break time!” Rick said, patting my back and snapping me out of a trance I was stuck in. I don’t know how hours passed but I wasn’t worried about that, I now have an excuse to leave this suffocating prison for a chance to breathe.
“I’ll show you where I keep some of my good snacks if you wa-”
“No thank you!” I said rushing past Rick, probably too harshly. But at the time I didn’t care, I needed to get out of here. 
“O-Oh, ok. Guess he’s not a big snack guy?”
Again I sat in a spot where I should be fine, where I should be comfortable. My usual spot where I smoke away my  first half of the day and get ready for the next. Thinking of what I could be doing instead of this, but not now. I sat with my knees to head in a ball feeling like I’m being watched all over again. A looming fear crawling back inside where it shouldn’t belong. Now I sat hopeless not knowing what to do or why this was happening. I wanted to disappear, me or whatever was out there to go away. I tried to pray but I couldn’t get the words out, or think if I was even going to say it properly. I held myself tighter wishing for all of it to go away till I heard the door open beside me.
“Ethen?” It was Rachel, someone I hadn’t realized I wanted to see but was so grateful for her to be there right beside me.
“Is everything ok? You looked out of it the whole day and rushed out the moment you could. Clearly something is wrong and you’re not telling.” Rachel said as she made her way right next to me and sat quite close to where I’m currently curled up. 
“You may not like it, but you have people who would gladly hear your worries and help in any way we can. Rick is holding down the fort for now, so we have time to get anything off your chest if it’s really bothering you this much!” She really is such a sweet person, and honestly I’ve been waiting for this moment forever, one moment with just the two of us alone together. One chance to be alone with the prettiest, kindest, and most lovely individual I know. Open up to her and form a bond that will grow stronger with time. To have both sides to truly know and understand the other’s struggles and joys, one which I’ve dreamed and fantasized for quite some time. It would be so easy to tell her, so simple to say “I had problems sleeping”, or “I’ve been having the strangest day” anything. I didn’t even need to tell her the full story, one bit and she’ll understand and comfort me the best she could. More than what I needed, but what I craved deeply.
“......I’m sorry Rachel. I’ve probably worried both you and Rick today. It’s….something I’m dealing with. I don’t want to get either of you to get involved. Thank you for worrying about me so much, I really do appreciate it.” Those words came out so easily, the most I’ve said without fumbling my words. The most normal sentence I’ve been wanting to be able to say to her, but not the words I wanted her to hear.
“......Ok Ethen. But if you ever change your mind and want someone to talk to, you have two pairs of ears who will gladly listen.” Rachel said as she stood up. Before heading back inside she gave me one more reassuring smile. Not the smile I wanted, but it still warms me from the cold isolation that surrounds me.
I waited until Rachel's warm smile could no longer keep away the cold and fear before heading back inside. I walked past Rick who seemed a bit worn out from dealing with the store all on his own. When he saw me he quickly changed his tired look to that of worried concern. 
“You good, Ethen?” you now when someone like Rick means what they say when there’s no jokes or puns to what they are saying. He always cares but only in times like this does he show it in full force.
“Yeah, I’m good. Sorry.” I didn’t even look him in the eyes. I really felt bad for putting him through all of my crap, but I was still thinking about how I failed my one chance with Rachel that I couldn’t even properly say sorry to my only friend. I continued my way to the register, glad to know that one of the eyes that are on me are ones that I know and are glad that they are there. I was still paranoid and scared, but the rest of the day went on like normal. I could see the faces of the afternoon customers and I could hear their rants and sly remarks like usual. Time went by faster than normal, which I don’t know if it was a blessing or a curse. Both Rachel and Rick came by to check on me, I lied to them again and said “I’m fine”, keeping then at arms length for hopefully someones own good. End of the day was here and the three quiet employees of Random Shack did their last tasks of the day before closing.
“Ok Rachel, you can head on back and get some rest for school.” It’s not often to see Rick to act like a gentle father, but he would be a great dad to have growing up with.
“Thanks Rick, but I’ll stay around for a bit. Gotta make sure everything’s alright, I think it’s best for me to stay just a bit longer.” Even the kind Rachel never asked to stay past her work hours, I must be one hell of a mess for her to go out of her way twice for someone like me.
“If that’s what you want, then I’ll allow it. Just make sure you don’t do anything crazy, it’s already putting my boxers in a bind to make sure one of our employees is alright.”
“Don’t worry Rick, I’ll be out of the way.” Having Rachel in the last few moments of closing the store was a blessing I didn’t know that I wanted. She stood by the door quietly watching over me and Rick doing the last of the tasks for the night, asking if I needed help even though he still has stuff he needs to bo. I really do appreciate what both of them are doing, I wish I can return the favor in any way I can. With Rachel watching me work I didn’t get the sense of needing to look impressive or needing to be perfect in what I was doing when Rachel was there watching me, I just felt calm and at peace with her there. Like the sun peeking out over the clouds from a cold day to warm me up, probably the only time I enjoyed doing work in my life. After finishing the last of our nightly tasks Rick said his lines like a tradition that must be upheld, but with less enthusiasm then normal,
“And with that, the Shack is closed.” No one can blame him for not ending off with a high note, especially me who caused the whole awkward problem. But I was kinda hoping to hear Rick's usual self before parting ways for tonight.
 “Ethen. You're probably sick and tired of hearing this all day, but are you sure you don’t want either of us to walk you home. Neither of us mind for tonight, we’re more than happy to help in any way we can.”
“It’s true. I may not have anything fancy or a magic spell to cast away your problem, but I’ll gladly do what I can if you need it.” While it is true I was getting tired of hearing the same worried concerns the whole day, I did want to stay with them just a bit longer. Away from the impending fear I can’t bare to face, the unknown that haunts me. I so desperately want the three of us to be here as long as I can, but today my mouth and body refuse to listen to me, almost like it doesn't understand what’s about to happen when I leave the only pillars I can lean on.
“Thanks you two. I really do appreciate you saying that. But I’ll be fine, I don’t live too far from here. I’ll be home in no time. You guys head home and get some rest. I’m sure I’ll be back to normal by tomorrow.” That last bit was a lie, I knew that was a lie yet I still said it. I said so many lies today I might as well name a new sin after me. I hate it, and I don’t understand why I did that. I don’t want to leave, I don’t want to go back home, and I know for damn sure that I wont be ok tomorrow, if I can make it to tomorrow. Both Rick and Rachel looked at each other then looked back at me knowing there’s no point in arguing and will let me be.
“If you say so. But if you change your mind, you know where I live, yeah?”
“Goodnight Ethan, I hope a goodnight sleep will be what the doctor ordered.” I nodded my head then walked back home, I wished that of once they weren't such nice people and pressured me into saying what I been wanting to say this whole day. I didn’t look back, I wanted to but I didn’t. My body refuses to look back on the only people who care, slowly feeling their warm pressens fade away as I walked further away till it’s fully gone. Now standing in front of what should be my home, feels alien. I’ve never stood in front of anything that felt so unwelcoming. I made my way inside, how? I would like to know, my body has been doing everything all on its own to the point where I wouldn’t be surprised if someone else was controlling it. I did my nightly duties in a trance, like my mind was still processing how I managed to walked through the front door. It’s only until I stood in front of my bed where I was able to move my body the way I wanted to, only to be replaced by fear. I curled up back to a ball right next to my bed, not wanting to move or know what was about to happen. I subconsciously turned off the light like I was about to go to sleep, but that’s the last thing I wanted to do. Deep down I know that if I close my eyes, the worse will happen. That be it I never awake again or something else was anyone's guess. All I do know is that I should get up, turn on the light and wait out the night. But fear has a stronger hold than reason, holding me down in that one spot in the dark. Like it knows what will happen if I close my eyes and sleep one last time. I tried to make a last ditch effort and force myself with everything I had to get up and out of the bedroom, but failed miserably as I slipped and bumped on the side of my bed. Somehow my face brushing against the side of my bed was enough for me to succumb to fatigue and tiredness, my eyes grew too heavy to keep open as I fell asleep on my bedroom floor and faced whatever was in store for me……….

1nc96f8,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1nc96f8/the_swarm_chapter_49_acceleration/,The Swarm. Chapter 49: Acceleration.,"


Chapter 49: Acceleration.

Earth 2092 15 years since the Swarm arrival.

Several months had passed since the arrival of the Hive technician. Several months that, for the Guard's key research centers, felt like a jump into hyperspace. A time in which humanity, led by the hand of an extraterrestrial mentor, made a technological leap that would have taken another long half-century under normal, peaceful conditions.

Mike, as he asked to be called, proved to be an invaluable, though unsettling, catalyst for progress. He did not sit on committees, write reports, or participate in political councils. His methods were direct and absolutely effective. He wandered from one research center to another, from the orbital shipyards where the hulls of new battleships were being welded, to the terrestrial factories in Nevada and Siberia where quantum computer cores were produced in sterile conditions. His physical presence, a slender, pearlescent silhouette moving silently among human machines, was in itself a motivating factor. But it was his knowledge and his way of imparting it that broke down barriers.

He did not give traditional lectures. He would enter a laboratory where a team of the best physicists had been struggling for weeks with the problem of plasma instability in a new type of reactor, stand in silence, and his large, multifaceted eyes would seem to analyze each of them individually. And then, in a calm, synthetic voice that appeared directly in the minds of the engineers and scientists, he would personally explain the most intricate theories of trans-standard physics. He used no analogies or simplifications. He projected pure, elegant, terrifyingly complex equations and three-dimensional models of quantum fields into their consciousness. He showed them mental shortcuts, pointed out fundamental errors in their reasoning that stemmed from the limitations of their three-dimensional perception, and opened doors for them to perceive realities they never knew existed.

Most of Earth's greatest minds listened to him with a mixture of reverent awe and profound bewilderment. They were like first-grade students to whom a brilliant professor was trying to explain the theory of relativity. They could barely follow his train of thought, grasping only fragments, single concepts that in themselves were enough to make a breakthrough in their field. Working with Mike was intellectually humiliating, but incredibly productive.
But there was one exception.
The scene took place in the main auditorium of the research center in Nevada. The hall was filled to the brim with the world's leading physicists. Mike, standing on stage before a huge holographic screen, was presenting the concept of the fourth generation of fusion reactors, the so-called ""suns in a box."" The problem was no longer initiating and sustaining the reaction. The problem was the efficiency of energy conversion.

""Your current models,"" Mike's voice explained in their heads, ""are based on thermal heat exchange. The plasma heats a medium, which drives turbines. This method is primitive and wasteful. There is a possibility of direct conversion of gamma radiation and neutrinos into usable electrical energy. However, this requires the use of a medium that is both a superconductor and capable of a controlled quantum state change when bombarded with high-energy particles.""
An equation appeared on the screen. A long, beautiful, and, for almost everyone in the room, absolutely incomprehensible string of symbols that described the behavior of a new, liquid nano-silicon alloy that the Hive used in its reactors. The entire room fell silent in a sense of deep, intellectual helplessness. They saw the mountain peak, but they had no idea how to climb it.
And then, out of the silence, a single voice asked a question. It was not a question of clarification. It was a question of elaboration. Of implication.

""Mike… if this alloy is able to maintain quantum coherence in such extreme temperature and radiation conditions, does that mean we can completely bypass the thermal exchange phase? Can we, by modulating the reactor's magnetic field, induce a direct, controlled state change in the alloy itself, so that as it flows through the coils, it generates the current itself? Can your alloy be both the coolant and the generator?""
The voice belonged to Aris Thorne.
Mike stopped his presentation. His triangular head slowly turned toward the source of the question. His large, multifaceted eyes, which until now had swept across the entire room, focused solely on the admiral's brother. A silence so profound fell in the room that one could only hear the hum of the ventilation systems. At that moment, everyone understood that they were witnessing something exceptional. The two greatest physicists in the Solar System—one from Earth, the other from the stars—had established a connection that was inaccessible to anyone else.

""Correct, Dr. Thorne,"" Mike finally replied, and in his voice, for the first time, there was something akin to… interest. ""That is precisely the next logical step in this technology. I did not anticipate us reaching this topic for another three of your months. Your ability to extrapolate theoretical models is… highly non-standard. Please, come forward. Let us explore the implications of this solution for your battleship designs together.""

Aris Thorne, slightly stunned but with his eyes burning with excitement, stood up and walked towards the stage. He wasn't just keeping up. He understood. He saw the forest while others were still lost among the trees. He had an innate, natural talent for perceiving the fundamental laws of the universe, but now that talent was enhanced, accelerated. The Hive nanite treatment he had undergone to cure his radiation sickness after the incident on the ""Pioneer"" had not only halted his aging. It had optimized his neural network, increasing the speed and clarity of his thought, removing biological limitations. His mind had become a powerful tool, capable of operating on a level that was dangerously close to that of his new teacher.
From that day on, Aris Thorne became Mike's primary intellectual partner on Earth. They worked together, often in seclusion, in Aris's private laboratory in Nevada. But Aris was not alone. At his side, as an equal partner, stood his wife.

Elara, after passing the most rigorous security clearances in the Guard with flying colors, had joined his team as one of the project's first and foremost physicists. Her mind, though not as abstract and intuitive as Aris's, was incredibly analytical and pragmatic. She was an engineer at heart. She could take the most esoteric theories from Aris and Mike and forge them into working, practical solutions. Together, they formed a duo that drove the progress of the entire fleet construction program at a pace that made even Admiral Thorne's head spin.
Their laboratory was their sanctuary. A vast, underground space filled with holographic tables, intelligent glass walls on which they sketched equations, and the quiet hum of a private quantum computer connected directly to the Hive. They spent their days and nights there, often forgetting to eat or sleep, fueled only by coffee and the pure, unbridled joy of discovery.

Their work was like a dance. Aris would throw a new, wild idea onto the table, sketching complex patterns in the air. Elara would immediately catch its weak points, point out material problems, energy limitations. They argued, debated, finished each other's sentences, and then, in a sudden flash of insight, they would find a solution that was a synthesis of their two minds—brilliant in its theory and elegant in its execution.
It was a golden time for them. A time of professional triumph and rediscovered intimacy, cemented by a shared passion. But this triumph had its dark, personal price. A price they tried not to think about, but which always lurked in the background, like a quiet, ticking clock.

One evening, as twilight settled in the laboratory and they, in a state of elation, were just finishing sketching new equations on the holographic table—equations that, if their calculations were correct, could double the efficiency of the reactors in the ""Thor""-class battleships—a discreet, pulsing notification appeared on Aris's personal terminal. It was the quarterly progress report from the Guard Candidate Training Center.

Their joyous, excited conversations ceased immediately. Elara placed a hand on her husband's shoulder, and her smile vanished, replaced by an expression of concern. Aris hesitated for a moment, his finger hovering over the icon. Opening this report was like voluntarily inflicting pain upon himself. But he had to do it. He was their father.
He opened it. A short, several-minute video recording, devoid of sound, appeared on the screen.

The camera, likely from an observation drone, showed a brutal training ground, modeled after the rocky wastelands of one of Saturn's moons. The scenery was stark, in shades of gray and black, illuminated by the harsh, cold light of a simulated, distant sun. A group of twenty recruits in simple, gray Guard training uniforms was navigating a murderous obstacle course.

Aris and Elara immediately recognized two of them. Young people in their twenties, no longer the children they remembered. It was Kael and Lyra. Their children.
15 years and six months had passed since the Swarm arrival. Kael was now 28, Lyra was 26.
They were dirty, sweaty, their faces smeared with synthetic mud, and their bodies were covered in bruises and scrapes. They were exhausted to the limit, but in their movements, in the way they overcame each obstacle, there was a new, hard, relentless determination. This was no longer youthful energy. This was trained, brutal efficiency.

Aris watched as his son, Kael, whom he remembered as a slender, pensive boy with his nose in an Xbox 17 console, was now a lean, muscular young man. With incredible strength and agility, he scaled a high, icy wall, and then, without wasting a second, turned and extended a hand to his sister.
Lyra, his daughter, always small and stubborn, was climbing behind him, her bleeding fingers slipping on the cold handholds. Just as she was about to fall, Kael's hand grabbed her forearm and with a powerful jerk, he pulled her to the top. They stood there for a second, panting heavily, and exchanged a brief, emotionless nod. It was not a gesture of sibling love. It was the gesture of two soldiers from the same unit, helping each other survive another day in hell.

Beneath the recording was a short, text-based report. ""Cadet Kael Thorne: Progress in line with expectations. Demonstrates above-average physical strength and leadership abilities under combat stress. Still working on subordinating individual initiative to Guard protocols."" ""Cadet Lyra Thorne: Exceptional resistance to pain and fatigue. Marksmanship scores place her in the top five percent of her class. Exhibits tendencies toward solitary action; further work on team integration required.""

Aris looked at those words and at the image of his children, and his heart was torn between excruciating pain and a monstrous, shameful pride. He had forced them down this path. So they would have the chance to live for 1000 years. Fate had left them only one path to receive the nanites, to save them from time and disease—the infantry. The hardest, most brutal, and most dangerous service. And they were passing the test he had set for them. They were becoming strong. They were becoming tough. They were becoming soldiers. His brother's soldiers.

He slowly tore his gaze from the screen and looked at Elara. Her beautiful face was pale, and in her eyes, which just moments before had shone with the joy of discovery, tears now welled. Her smile was gone, replaced by an expression of boundless sorrow. She didn't have to say anything. He understood.
And then his gaze fell upon the complex equations shimmering on the holographic table. The equations that were meant to give his brother's battleships even more power. The equations that were supposed to help win the war. The war to which he was sending his own children.

He had achieved his goal. He was saving his family, giving them the gift of immortality. But he was doing it by transforming them into perfect, faceless cogs in the war machine he was so passionately helping to build. And looking at his wife's face and the specter of his children on the screen, for the first time in his life, this brilliant, rational man of science had no idea if what he had done was salvation, or the worst damnation imaginable.

1nc96bu,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/1nc96bu/had_to_call_the_ambulance_after_telling_my_mom/,Had to call the ambulance after telling my mom with dementia that she couldn't take another shower and she started freaking out and slapped me.,"Mom was diagnosed with dementia in May. Though it became apparent something was wrong with her in February when she had multiple seizures from drug withdrawal after she threw out her all medicine. She's had mental health issues for years. Depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety attacks and years of drug addiction. At first I wrote off her behavior as just a new form of the crazy manic behavior I've been dealing with my whole life. It wasn't till she threw out her medicine that I realized it wasn't just her usual crazy. 

Since February and the seizure incident, she has been a completely different person. Gone was the mother I grew up with. Instead I was left with a stranger who was in no way capable of caring for herself. She no longer wanted to watch the news, drink coffee or take naps. The woman has smoked weed my entire life, she would smoke from the moment she woke up till she went to bed. There was other substance abuse over the years but Marijuana was a constant. She came home and didn't even want to smoke anymore. Nothing drove the point home that this was more than just her usual manic behavior than that. 

I've had to call the EMS for her at least 10 times since that initial incident. At first it was panic attacks where she was short of breath and hyperventilating. Then it was drug interactions from her doctors trying to change her medicine. Last month it was more panic attacks where she was not just hyperventilating, she was shaking uncontrollably and basically incoherent. They kept her for a week and switched her medicine again. The past few weeks she has been getting worse and worse with her OCD behavior. I spoke with her doctors office and they said it was just her adjusting to the new medicine. 

She's been having these issues with these weird OCD compulsion since February. At first it was wanting to take walks or sit outside. Then it was chain smoking. Then it was using the bathroom. Now it's this intense desire for a shower. 

I quit working to stay with mom full time. My husband lives with us but we're in the process of getting a divorce (thats a whole other story) however he is the only one who is around to help. So we're staying together for her sake. Luckily things are amicable between us. Anyway. I get one day a week off from momsitting and I was gone most the day. I came home to a nightmare. 

Yesterday was bad but I managed to distract her from the shower obsession by making her sit downstairs with me and listen to music. Today, she just wouldn't stop. She had probably 50 showers today. Stands in there for a minute or two. Gets out and then says she needs to take a shower. He would tell her not, she said she needs to use the bathroom. Goes in the bathroom and then gets right back in the shower. This went on all day apparently. 

How do you tell someone not to shower or that they can't use the bathroom?

I came home and the bathroom was covered in water. Every towel was wet. I tried to get her out the shower and help her get dressed and she flipped. Smacked me in the face when I was trying to hug her and lead her to the bedroom.  I had my husband literally come hold her down and I called 911. The police showed up and my husband is trying to hold her down while she is kicking him and screaming at the top of her lungs. They literally had to handcuff her hands and feet. She was buck naked and carried out in a sling thingy still yelling and kicking. 

I just didn't know what to do. I know showers are not necessarily bad for you. But 50 in a day? I was literally scared the bathtub was going to fall through the floor. Or she was going to fall. I just couldn't get her to stop. When she started getting violent I gave up and called 911. The police showed up first to assess the situation and I'm sure they were the ones who had the ambulance come after they asked us to leave the room and she kicked the officer in the face. I'm sure the 911 dispatcher thought i was insane, who calls 911 over someone showering? The officers were probably seeing if an ambulance was really needed given the number of times I have had to call in the past few months. 

So that was my day. The fun never ends over here. 

So anyone else have any similar problems or any idea what I should have done differently. ",1,1757390872.0,dementia,0,1.0,False

**RECAP**

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/bxVVhHt3hq): **June 16, 2025**

I'm 98.7% sure that I am not the AH here, but I'm wrong I'm willing to admit it and learn from my mistakes.

Our little boy will be one late this summer, so this was the first mothers day and fathers day for both me and my husband. My husband asked what I wanted for mothers day. I didn't want/need anything big or expensive. What I asked for is:

* For husband to get up with the little guy and get him fed while I pumped and chilled
* Breakfast in bed - just toast, scrambled eggs and coffee
* For us to take the little guy to the zoo for the first time. This was the main thing I was looking forward to.
* Go to my fav taco place for dinner

Between morning and afternoon naps we have about 4 hours of awake time. The zoo is abt 30 min away so I had figured if we left as soon as he got up from his nap and ate, we'd have a couple hours at the zoo and worst case he could sleep in the car on the way home.

We took my mom and my MIL out to brunch the prior weekend to celebrate them- his mom on Saturday and my mom on Sunday. I also got them each a thoughful little present and flowers to celebrate their first mothers day as grandparents. I arranged everything and told my mom and MIL that we'd be celebrating on the actual day with just our little family and sent them a group chat (which included husband, my dad and FIL) just to make sure everyone is on the same page. My MIL is very pushy and overbearing so I didn't want there to be any surprises or confusion.

The Saturday before Mother's Day, FIL sent my husband a text with a picture of all the mulch he just had delivered and said something like ""gonna be a busy weekend!"" or something like that. Apparently he had 300 bags of mulch (they have a big yard with lots of flower beds). That night my MIL called my husband and asked him to come over first thing in the morning to help his dad move the bags of mulch to where they were going to be used. She said since we weren't going to the zoo until after little guy's nap, that husband could go over and help for a couple hours and then come pick us up to go to the zoo. I was obviously not happy but she guilted him and said FIL was going to end up hurting himself if he moved all that by himself and that its not a big deal and should only take an hour or two. I told him his mom was doing this to try and get us to skip our plans and spend the day with them but he kept saying it's not a big deal, saying his mom promised it would only take a couple hours, etc etc.

I think most people know what happened - husband went over first thing, which means no breakfast in bed and I had to get up to feed the little guy. I was kinda pissed, but whatever. Spent time with the little guy then when he went down for his morning nap I texted my husband to let him know he should start wrapping things up. Then when little guy woke up 2hrs later I called husband to tell him I'd be ready to go as soon as I finished feeding the little guy. He told me it was taking longer than he expected but that he'd hurry. Like an hour and a half later husband called and said they weren't done but he was getting ready to come home. It's 15-20 minute drive from MIL/FILs house. At that point we'd missed the window to make it to zoo so I told him to just stay there and finish and not worry about Mothers Day since he hadn't done a single thing I asked for. I don't think there wasy any doubt in his mind how pissed I was. A little later his mom called and said since we decided not to go to the zoo, that me and little guy should go hang out with her while ""the boys"" finished with the mulch. I admit that I was pretty pissy and told her I had no interest in spending time with the people who decided to ruin my first mothers day. I ended up staying home and ordering a pizza and binging Netflix.

When husband got home he was all apologetic and asked how he could make it up. I was still pissed and told him he could make it up by not ruining my first mothers day. I also told him he should plan on spending Fathers Day with his mom and dad bc me and the little guy were going to go celebrate Fathers Day with my mom and dad.

Since Mother’s Day MIL has been texting and calling but I've been keeping conversations short and just giving very bland generic responses.

My husband has been apologizing and asking what he can do but honestly I don't want to bother. I know it's just a day and we can celebrate any time, like we did with my mom & MIL. But it was my first ever Mothers day. And it's not like I asked for anything expensive or difficult. The only difficult thing is he's incapable of setting boundaries with his mom. And she's incapable of considering anyones feelings but her own.

This past Saturday he asked if I was still going to my parents then said he'd like to go with us. I told him he could do whatever he wanted but since I hadn't done anything for his dad he might want to go see him or something. We did both end up going to my parents and spending the day with them. It was actually a nice day. My dad insisted on grilling because of course he did but the weather ended up being nice and we spent a lot of time hanging out on their deck playing with the little guy.

I'm not sure what if anything my husband did for his dad. I know he was getting a lot of texts during the day, I assume from his mom. She did send me a snippy text saying it was hurful to spend the day with my family at the expense of husbands but I told her she got to spend Mothers day with her baby boy so it's only fair that I spend Fathers day with my family.

I know my husband was hurt that we didn't acknowledge him for Fathers Day but I told him while we were driving to my parents house that I'm just matching his energy. I admit that I haven't done anything to de-escalate the drama but I'm still just so hurt he continues to prioritize his mom's feeling over our little family. This isn't the first time his mom has done crap like this and I'm just so tired of it. She always oversteps and insists on doing what SHE wants. I'm doing better at keeping her at arms length and holding my own boundaries but my husband is absolutely incapable of it.

[Update #1](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/tAW2NQyTJc): **June 23, 2025 (six days later)**

I posted here last week, you can find it in my profile if you want the backstory. I wanted to thank everyone. I've had a lot of people asking for an update, so here we go.

This weekend the husband and I sat down and talked about everything. I expressed to him how incrediably upset and disappointed I was at how both Mother's Day and Father's Day went down. I really wanted to recognize and celebrate my husband for FD everybit as much as I hoped he would recognize and celebrate me for MD. He said he knew he shouldn't have gone to his parents on MD but didn't know what to do since his mom was pressuring him and saying if his dad got hurt it would be husbands fault. He admitted that he knew he messed up and has been terrified that I was going to ask for a divorce.

Since he cut to the chase, I told him that if this is how our life is going to be, I don't want to stay married to him. I explained to him that I realized that while yes, I was upset about what happened on Mother's Day, that isn't what is making me feel this way. That was just the straw the broke the camels back. This kind of behavior from his mom has been happening since we before got engaged and has just escalated. This has been happening for YEARS. As someone here suggested, I had listed all the times/events (that I could remember) that she had overstepped or just completely ruined. For our freaking honeymoon, she called him TWICE A DAY. Every monrning to find out our plans for the day and then every evening to hear how the day went. Plus the constant texting, asking for pictures, telling him how much she missed him. I don't know how I thought this was acceptable. She tried to make our wedding about herself, tried to make my pregnancy about herself, tried to take over when we brought our son home, just constantly inserting herself and overstepping.

I told him that I don't really want to get divorced right now, but it's going to happen anyway, I'd rather get divorced now while we can still do it amicably. Because if nothing changes I'm going to end up so angry and resentful that it would make divorce very contentious and I don't want that for our son. At this point we were both crying, upset and emotional. So I told him that I'll give him some time to decide what he's going to do but if I don't see clear effort being made to start prioritize me and our son that I'd move forward with the divorce. And the change has to continue. Everytime we've fought about this in the past, he's promised he'll change and sometimes he has, but then his mom pulls him back into her orbit.

If we are to stay married - these are some of the things I'm insisting on in no particular order:

* We each own the relationship with our own parents. That means I'm not planning anything for his parents anymore. No cards, no presents, no burnches or parties, no pictures, nothing. If his parents reach out to me I'm going to redirect them to him.

* I'm not entertaining or visiting with his parents when he's not around. I'm not taking our son over to theirs by myself. And if they ""drop by"" I'm not inviting them in unless my husband is there.

* I'm not changing my plans at the last minute just because they decided to drop by without coordinating with us in advance or because they want us to do something with them.

* Neither of us makes plans with our parents or accepts invitations until we discuss with our partner. And if we don't both agree the we don't do it. And we don't throw each other under the bus, we just say something like ""we checked our schedule and we're not available"".

* Holiday's like Christmas, Halloween, Easter, etc are at our house. We can discuss inviting our parents but we're not going to someone else house to celebrate something involving our son when we can do it at home. This includes his 1st bday which MIL is trying to take over and plan.

* Other holidays we're alternate between our parents. And we will focus on being present. That means no more texting/talking to his mom non-stop when we're with my parents.

* No more oversharing with MIL. She doesn't need to know about our finances or health/medical issues or vacation plans or anything unless we both agree its something we want to share.

* His visits to his parents can't be at the expense of spending quality time with me and our son. I don't mind him visiting his parents, but he's over there a couple times a week. We are his immediate family now, we should get priority.

* We're not doing things just because she said we should. And we're not changing our plans just because she doesn't like them. She really doesn't understand that ""Wrong"" and ""Different"" are not the same thing. In her mind, if we're not doing what she wants, HOW she wants, then we are in the wrong.

* He needs to go to therapy with someone specializing in enmeshment. And we need to start going to couples therapy. I didn't even realize I have so much pent-up resentment that I can't look at my husband the same anymore. I'm just angry at him all the time and I hate being this way.

* When it comes to our son, our word (husband and me) is law. If she disregards or minimizes our decisions for our son, then she loses access until she learns to behave.

* When me or my husband say ""No"" to either set of parents, the other person will support them and back them up. That means my husband has to stop trying to get me to agree with his mom all the time.

I can tell he's freaked out and really stressed about the idea of putting hard boundaries in place or distancing from his parents. And I do feel for him. He said he feels like he's caught between a rock and a hard place and that me and his mom are both putting a ton of pressure on him and both have conflicting expectations. And that's fine. He just needs to understand that I'm not tolerating this anymore. I know this will cause an absolute shit storm with his parents but I feel like if we don't do it now, it'll just be harder down the road.

What does everyone think? Am I being unreasonable? Are there other boundaries we should put in place?

#----NEW UPDATE----

[Update #2](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/Phm2FPE1ac): **September 2, 2025 (2.5 months later)**

UPDATE 2: AITAH For not planning anything for fathers day after my husband ruined my first mothers day

I've had a lot of folks asking for an update, so here goes!  First off, thank you all to everyone who commented on my earlier posts, good and bad, it has been so helpful.

Couple things I want to mention first. A lot of commenters have been saying that I knew what I was getting into when I married DH so this whole thing is as much my fault as anyone elses and if I didn't want a mama's boy, I shouldn't have married one. Yep, you are 100% correct. I ignored all the red flags, constantly told myself it would get better once we were engaged, then once we were married, then once we got pregnant, then once we had kids. And I think part of the issue is she's gotten worse over the years. It feels like one of those frog-in-a-pot-of-boiling-water situations. I don't deny I put myself into this situation but the fact is we're here now so we need to get it figured out. A lot of other commentors said my ""list of rules"" was crazy and I'm just as bad as his mom. Maybe I am (more on that later), but I don't think there is anything about my boundaries that is unreasonable and there is nothing there that I expect from him and his parents that I don't also expect from myself and my parents. I've said repeatedly, they all boil down to the same basic thing: showing each other respect and consideration. I'm not saying he can't see his parent or that they can't come visit or anything like that. I'm saying that his parents don't get to have priority over us and our little family, and neither do my parents. 

First the good. My husband ended up surprising me with a trip out of town. He took me and LO down to San Antonio for a long weekend. We had been pre-kid and really enjoyed staying on the riverwalk and doing all the touristy stuff even though we only live a few hours away. DH ended up really stressed and kept apologizing because obviously this trip was much different. It felt more like a military expedition with all the gear we took for LO and it wasn't nearly as romantic since we had a pack-and-play next to the bed. But I kept reminding him that what was important (to me at least) was that he took the initiative to plan something on his own and try to make up for Mother's Day. Even though it wasn't exactly what hubs was hoping for, I had a really really good time and enjoyed spending time with my two guys and I expressed that to him. And to his credit, DH didn't answer when his mom called or spend all day texting her. I know he paid for it when we got back because I heard them on the phone and it sounded like she was reading him the riot act for not telling them we were going, not inviting them along, and not answering when she called. I'm going to do something for him as a belated fathers day and we're going to try to build different, better memories of our first MD/FD, even if it's after the fact. 

More good stuff, DH and I both have individual therapists we've been seeing weekly for the past several weeks as well as a couples therapist we have been seeing weekly together. And I'm going back to work full time next week so LO has been going to daycare part time to help him acclimate. The first day was pretty traumatic, more for me than for LO! But, he's been adjusting well and seems happy when I pick him up after lunch (this is a huge point of contention with MIL b/c she wants to baby sit but I've said absolutely not because she won't respect any of our rules or boundaries). I've also been following through on my list of boundaries on my last post. I'm not NC, but I guess the term is I've dropped the rope. 

Now the bad. For LOs first birthday I was planning something small and casual at our house. Just our parents, and a few close friends. Like, 10-15 people max, counting me and DH. I was going to make a smash cake for LO and more grownup type food/snacks/desert for us and guests. I was planning some low key decorations because lets be honest, this kind of party is for the adults. Kiddo isn't going to remember any of it so I didn't want to go overboard. MIL hated everything about it and wanted to do it at her house, invite all her friends and relatives, serve more kid-centric food, get a store bought cake with all that super sweet icing, and go nuts with decorations. I told her 'no, absolutely not. Our kid, our house, our plans'. She went crying to DH and he tried to talk me into letting her have her way. This has been a constant theme. MIL oversteps, I complain, DH puts up boundaries, and then just as quickly DH forgets about the boundaries.

We were able to talk about this in one of our early couples sessions and it was pretty enlightening. I'm sure all the people saying DH just ended up marrying some just like his mom will be gratified to know our counselor said ""OP can have a forceful personality"". So yea, I'm bossy/pushy/opinionated/etc. How it came up is we were talking about the party and I was saying what I wanted to do and why I didn't want to let my MIL take over, etc and DH was trying to explain why we should accommodate MIL. The therapist interrupted us and ask DH what ***HE*** wanted to do. DH started talking about my plan vs his mom's plan and the therapist stopped him and asked again what ***HE*** wants. Based on his reaction, I don't think anyone has ever seriously asked him that. He had a complete deer in headlights look and I really though he was going to bolt or start crying or both. 

How we ended it is, if he truly doesn't have an opinion or doesn't care then he should probably defer to my (his wife) approach. He shouldn't delegate his right to decide to his mom. If he really want to do it her way, then he needs to express that and say he wants to do it her way because he really wants to do it her way as opposed to doing it her way just to avoid upsetting her. Or if he wants something completely different, he needs to express that. But his mom's opinion is not and cannot take precedence. Nothing wrong with her expressing her opinion and him agreeing but that needs to be an active process as opposed to him just doing something because she said so. 

That was followed up by a conversation about how I have strong thoughts and opinions and I need to give him room to have his own. So rather than saying: ""I want to do x"" and then expecting him to agree or disagree I need to say something like ""For LOs birthday, I have some ideas but I'd like to hear what you think first so we can decide together"". 

We did end up doing the party the way I wanted because DH took the therapists advice and deferred to me since he didn't have an opinion. MIL was super pissy about the whole thing and ended up bringing a sheet cake despite me telling her multiple times not too. We didn't serve it during the party (because boundaries) which pissed her off. DH and I have been munching on it as a late night snack after putting LO to bed and because of how insanely sweet the icing is, I'm glad I stuck to my guns. 

I feel better because I've put distance between myself and MIL and I'm not worrying about pissing her off so I'm not walking on egg shells any more. But I don't know if I'm any more confident about whether our marriage will survive. I'm realizing that DH has deferred to other people (MIL and me) for so long he has a hard time having his own thoughts and opinions. I do still love him very much, and I'm not as mad as I was when I first posted. Now I'm more sad for him and I'm starting to understand him better. But I don't know if he can change. I know she is complaining to him because I haven't been kowtowing to her and I haven't been visiting on my own or changing plans when they drop by unexpectedly but I'm not pushing him to establish his own boundaries yet. I think he needs to do more work so he can decide what **HE** wants out of all this.

All that to say, we're still working through it and I don't know what's going to happen.

**Top Comments**

**Commenter 1:** It sounds like he has some wonderful growth opportunities ahead. With you supporting his forays into the world of opinions, and with MIL held a safe distance away, I have hope that he can find out what he wants.

**Commenter 2:** Progress not perfection. Glad to see you guys headed in a positive direction. Hope it continues getting better.

**Commenter 3:** 

> DH started talking about my plan vs his mom's plan and the therapist stopped him and asked again what HE wants.

He doesn't have an opinion because his mom has steamrolled him on everyone all his life. That's why he defaults to siding with his mom, she's his decision making faculty. Glad your therapist shown a light on this.

he still needs a lot of therapy to cut that cord. But it looks like you're on the right track with this therapist. Good luck.

This morning, I was charging my EV at a public charger and left momentarily to grab a coffee across the street. When I returned, somebody had parked illegally in the ADA space next to the charger, pulled it out of my car, and plugged it into theirs. 

Of course this pissed me off, so I snapped a picture of their car in case I could report them to the charging station or something. The driver of the other car instantly flew into a rage. He and his passenger both jumped out of the car and ran at me. They boxed me in between my car and a fence and started screaming at me and recording me on their phones. 

I'm a woman, so I'm not trying to fight two obviously hysterical guys and give them fuel for their recording, so I just waited for them to step back then jumped in my car and locked the doors. 

They then went to either side of my car and started banging on the windows and trying to pull the doors open. I turned on my car and just grey-rocked them until they got bored and walked back to their own car.

Even though I felt like I was in danger, I didn't call 911. I've had bad interactions with cops in the past and thought they'd probably either not show up at all or eventually show up but say it was my fault for taking a picture of the other car. But I still want to report the driver & passenger because they really freaked me out. I looked into the non-emergency online report, but all it will let you report online is vandalism and theft. For anything else, you have to call the cops. I really, really don't want cops showing up at my house and having all my personal information. Is there any other way to report incidents like this anonymously?",2,1757390210.0,legaladvice,3,1.0,False
1nc8y65,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastroparesis/comments/1nc8y65/grieving_my_normal_life/,"Grieving my ""normal"" life","I've been having a hard time the past few months and am realizing I need to set more strict boundaries with plans involving food. I got diagnosed with gastroparesis in the past year, but have had stomach problems my whole life. 

So event #1 was that I was going to a friend of a friends (as a plus 1) bday dinner, and they set the dinner reservations for 8pm. I felt weary about it because I don't do well eating that late, it can lead me to being dizzy or having anxiety since its such a large gap between when I eat lunch vs dinner (usually eat lunch around 11am-12pm and dinner around 6-7). And surprise surprise, I felt like shit while waiting for the food to come (probably didnt actually get appetizers until around 8:30-8:40pm). Dizziness, anxiety, stomach discomfort, the works. Event #2 was a vacation with a family member, their eating schedule was basically morning coffee (no food for breakfast), eat lunch at work, and then have a small snack (fruit) for dinner. This does not work for me, I need to eat small meals dispersed across the day to prevent dizziness. This wouldn't be such a problem but they have hardly any food in their house 😭 and getting food here wasn't accessible. 

Anyways, these things happening is making me realize I don't have the same food habits as most of my loved ones and I need to pack my own food or reject plans that don't fall within my habits. It sucks to have to do this, it makes me feel worse about being a type A person. It feels like doing this makes me look like a control freak, but the reality for me is, is that not having my food habits under control can lead to several days (or worst case weeks) of discomfort to accommodate someone else. If you've gotten this far thanks for reading. I need to start grieving and get back in touch with my therapist to discuss these things. I'm sure many of you have already gone or are going through the same. I appreciate this community and having a network here ❤️",3,1757390178.0,Gastroparesis,1,1.0,False

I’m 19, running a marketing agency, working with a US company, and helping with an NGO + school. On paper, it all looks good—but inside I’m realizing how heavy the mind can get. Depression and anxiety don’t care about achievements.
I’ve learned that life isn’t about stacking tasks—it’s about finding the people who make those days worth living. I want real conversations: late-night calls where we talk about the meaning of life one moment and laugh at the dumbest memes the next.
I’m more mountains & coffee than clubs & shots. Into classic movies, story-driven games, books, poetry, and currently learning German.
If you’ve felt the same weight and kept pushing forward, drop your age, gender, and a random fact about you. Maybe we’ll understand each other better. Bonus if you’re up for late-night chats.

My weekday routine is supposed to be simple: swing by, grab something quick, and make it to school before the first bell.

Ideally, that means an extra-large tea, two slices of Casey’s breakfast pizza, and maybe a canned cold coffee. The problem? Except for the very first week of school, this Casey’s hasn’t had food ready when I stop by. Not even pizza. One day I asked how long it would take. “Seven minutes,” said the cook. Twenty minutes later—plus some grumbling from the cook—I finally got my food and showed up late to work.

Since then, I still drive through the lot and peek at the hot food rack through the window, but I usually end up at QuikTrip instead. Their food’s always ready, checkout is faster, but it’s not as good—and their new tea machines are not my favorite.

Here’s where I’m stuck:
Since school started, this Casey’s has lost over $400 in sales from me alone. As a manager, is that even noticeable, or just a drop in the bucket?

That if he was so concerned about money then he would cut buying lunch every day. 

I am a paid caretaker for our disabled child. So essentially get paid to be a SAHM to our disabled son. He says that because I am home and not busy, that I can pack his lunch. I am far from not busy. I clean the house daily. Laundry and dishes daily. Pack lunch and backpacks and taxi drive our children everywhere as well as multiple meetings, Dr's appt, therapy appts etc for our disabled son. I dont feel that I should be packing a lunch for this grown ass man. He is perfectly capable. Hes just unwilling and feels thats its my job to do this. He works out of the house and commutes over an hour each way. To say that i handle everything on the homefront and with our kids would be an understatement. I do not purchase coffee or lunch or anything of the sort. When i do, he points out how im home and have access to cook my own food at home.

1nc8veu,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1nc8veu/social_clubs_still_open_to_applicants_prelaw/,"Social Clubs Still Open To Applicants (Pre-Law, Engineering, Volunteering)","Miss out on a consulting club this semester? I recently graduated from Cal and was a member of a consulting club, but a lot of my closest friends were in non-business orgs. Looking back, I realized they often had a much healthier balance: friendlier communities, lower time commitments, and (surprisingly often) solid career outcomes too. So I wanted to share some honest thoughts on those clubs from what I’ve heard — the ones that still have applications, but are much easier to join and a lot less intense than consulting or finance orgs. 

**Most importantly, most of the clubs in this list still have applications open as of today!**

# Pre-Law

**ASUC Legal Clinic** – Members help students and local residents with free legal advice and tax prep! First semester is training and getting IRS-certified; second semester, you volunteer at least 3 hours per week at the clinic. Super tight-knit group that goes on retreats and parties well. Legend has it the last five presidents all ended up at Ivy League law schools.

**The Berkeley Forum** – Student-run org that brings famous speakers to campus (Dylan O’Brien, Anthony Fauci, Jaylen Brown, Peter Thiel). Surprisingly strong placement across finance, law, and tech (they send a few people to Goldman, McKinsey, FAANG, JPM each year). Members are close, with different committees to apply to, a reasonable time commitment (4–6 hrs/week), and a strong social culture with retreats and plenty of socials. Straightforward application open to all majors and interests.

# Engineering and STEM

**Space Exploration @ Berkeley (SEB)** – Members are insanely talented and dedicated. Every semester they design and launch liquid-fueled rockets in the desert, with the long-term goal of reaching the Kármán Line (the edge of space). Has a bunch of departments covering engineering and non-engineering work (sponsors, publicity, etc.). Almost all the upperclassmen have NASA, SpaceX, or defense contractor internships. Not the biggest party club, but everyone seems genuinely great.

**Formula Electric @ Berkeley** – Lower time commitment compared to SEB, with departments for building, racing, and marketing an electric-powered race car. Stronger party culture, fun members, and cool merch.

# Arts & Entertainment

**CALX** – Over 200 members run Berkeley’s radio station. Departments include special events, radio archives, music curation, publicity, and more. Less tight-knit because of the size, but they throw big parties and socials. No app required, just show up to intro meetings and put in a few hours a week.

**SUPERB** – The entertainment branch of ASUC. They host free concerts, movie screenings, game nights, and other events for all students. Don’t know anyone in it personally, but it looks like a blast for people into music, cinema, or arts.

**BAMPFA Student Committee** – Works with BAMPFA to get students involved with events like poster galleries, film exhibitions, opening nights, and art festivals. Full of art/film lovers. You can apply to different departments like marketing, film, or art curation.

# Volunteering

**Habitat for Humanity** – Huge club of volunteers. Not the most social unless you’re on exec, but they put effort into making meetings fun (skits, pranks, etc.). Leadership is solid and from all kinds of majors. Hard to track placements since most members join casually.

**Berkeley FeelGood Club** – Volunteers make grilled cheese sandwiches on Sproul, with proceeds going to Feeding America. Low commitment, fun vibe. Each semester, execs get an all-expenses-paid trip to Feeding America’s NYC conference. No application—just show up.

**BEAM** – STEM-heavy club where students teach local elementary and middle schoolers. Very wholesome, filled with kind and sharp people who genuinely care. Apps for this semester just closed (Sept 5), but they recruit every term.

# Other

**The Environmentalist Magazine** – For students interested in nature + journalism. Student-run magazine that produces 1-2 online issues per semester. Has different departments for art, photo, design, about 40 members total. Relatively new, but seems to have a good amount of socials like hiking trips, cookouts. Good exposure and practical reporting experience in a social group with low time commitment. 

**Caravan Magazine** – Travels each semester to a new city to document and write pieces for their magazine. Small and very competitive, but that makes the group extremely close.

**Berkeley Coffee Club** – Upperclassman-heavy club of coffee fanatics. They check out cafes weekly and sometimes host free tastings with their own brews. Low commitment, mostly just feels like a big group of friends.

**Poker @ Berkeley** – Hosts weekly poker nights with low-to-mid buy-ins and also runs the Poker decal. Chill way to meet new people, with a lot of overlap with business clubs and frats.

* Preparation time: This recipe takes about 35 minutes to prepare, assuming you have the ingredients to hand.
* Servings: I made 9 patolis with this mixture, but this may vary depending on the size of your patolis.
* 3 fresh turmeric leaves (this may vary depending on the size of the leaves).
* 1 cup of rice flour. I made the flour by grinding the rice in the mixer, but I recommend using the ready-made flour, as grinding the rice in the mixer does not give a clean result.
* ¾ cup of water.
* 1 pinch of salt
* ½ cup freshly grated coconut. I used desiccated coconut as I didn't have fresh coconut, but fresh coconut is ideal.

* 2 tablespoons of piloncillo or grated brown sugar
* ¼ teaspoon of finely grated sarrapia or tonka. The original recipe does not call for sarrapia, but for cardamom seed powder.
* 1 teaspoon of margarine. The original recipe contains ghee.
* 1 teaspoon of vegetable oil (to oil the turmeric leaves).
* Enough water to wash the leaves and steam the patoli.
* Bowl, cauldron, measuring cups, spoons, plates, napkins, a steamer or tamalera, etc. .



# THE PROCEDURE



Put the margarine in the cauldron, then add the grated coconut and the jaggery or piloncillo. Stir, cover and cook on a low heat for about 8 minutes. Stir occasionally to prevent the mixture from burning.

  
Then add a pinch of salt to the rice flour and gradually add the water, mixing with a spoon. Reserve.

  
Finely grate the sarrapia or tonka seeds and add to the coconut and piloncillo mixture. Stir and cook over a low heat. Cardamom powder is ideal. I went to the spice shop and couldn't find any, so I used sarapia.

  
Once the turmeric leaves are clean, cut them. I divided them into three parts and removed the leaf stem from each leaf.

  
Check that the piloncillo and coconut mixture is well incorporated. Remove from the heat. Using a napkin, oil the turmeric leaves. Do this on the top of each leaf. Then coat this surface with the rice flour and water mixture, which is quite soft. This can be done with your hands or with a spoon, the important thing is that this layer of dough is thin.

  
Place a small amount of the coconut and piloncillo mixture in the centre of the leaf. Fold the leaf over itself to make little packets, these are the patoli.

  
Place the patoli in a steamer and cook over a high heat for 20 minutes. As I don't have a steamer or a tamalera, I had to make do, as you can see in the photos. It is important to check that the water does not run out so that they steam properly.

  
After 20 minutes, remove from the steamer and allow to cool before serving. The patoli are ready.

  
The appearance of the patoli is not very neat, in fact I have seen several videos and photos of this recipe and obviously the shape of these will not be regular or exact as the shape is given by each piece of leaf. When I suggested using store-bought rice flour, I did so because I find that grinding rice at home results in something coarse. It may be my inexperience making this snack, the quality of the flour, or perhaps the size of the leaves, which influenced obtaining a not so neat result. The flavour of these snacks is very interesting. The turmeric is obvious, but it harmonises very well with the filling, which is delicious. The dough is rather neutral, but it serves as an amalgam between the turmeric and the delicious coconut and piloncillo filling. It is a snack that can be eaten with coffee, tea, horchata, infusions, it is very versatile. It only remains to say: Bon appetit!

“You have no idea how good it is to see you right now,” she said, stepping in with a grin.

He wrapped his arms around her before she could say another word. That first hug; a warm, tight, familiar feeling, yet forien, lingered a few beats longer than usual. Her body melted into his like it belonged there, her face nuzzling against his neck, and suddenly the hum of a simple lunch break felt like something far more electric.

She pulled back just enough to look up at him, her smile lazy, eyes searching. “You smell like coffee and trouble.”

“Only the second one’s intentional,” he whispered, brushing a kiss against her temple.

One kiss turned into two. Then three. Then his hands were at her waist, hers fisting in the back of his shirt, and before either of them could think better of it, they were pressed against the kitchen counter. Her lips were urgent, hungry, and so was the way she pulled him closer like the clock didn’t exist.
He broke the kiss just long enough to lift her onto the edge of the counter, his hands sliding over her scrubs, fingertips grazing the curve of her hips.
“You sure we’ve got time for this?” he murmured against her mouth.

This is a pretty big revelation for me since it means Campbell’s owns invaluable household name brands in Goldfish crackers and Milano cookies. Makes it much more interesting to me than just canned soup. 

Just like how Clorox owns Hidden Valley Ranch (acquired in 1972)!

Some snippets from the 1960 acquisition news: 

*“The Campbell Soup Company is expanding its food line into the bakery products field with the acquisition of Pepperidge Farm, Inc., of Norwalk, Conn. Under arrangements complet- ed yesterday, Campbell Soup agreed to exchange 357,413 shares of its common stock for Pepperidge Farm, a privately owned concern. Based on yes- terday's closing price for Camp- bell Soup of $78.75 on the New York Stock Exchange, the mar- ket value of these shares would be about $28,200,000.”*

*“The baking company (Pepperidge) has six plants, in Norwalk, Conn.; Downington, Pa., and Downers Grove, Ill. Its fifty-eight prod- ucts, which include bread, rolls, poultry stuffings, coffee cake and fancy cookies, are sold through 500 distributors and 50,000 retail stores across the country. It employs 1,700 people. Started in Home Kitchen Pepperidge Farm started twenty-three years ago, when Mrs. Margaret Rudkin hit upon the idea of selling a special bread she had been baking in her kitchen to help her son overcome some allergies.“*

*“W. B. Murphy, president of Campbell, said that Pepperidge Farm would continue to oper- ate with its own employes and officers as a separate company within the Campbell organiza- tion, Campbell, which has nine- teen plants in the United States and nine in foreign countries, turns out 104 food products. It also markets V-8 cocktail vege- table juice and Franco-Ameri- can and Swanson products. The Swanson line includes frozen pies. Campbell, which became pub- licly owned in 1955, has about 10,000,000 common shares out- standing. The Campbell shares to be used in the Pepperidge exchange, effective about Jan. 1, will come from authorized but unissued stock.“*

1nc86u8,https://www.reddit.com/r/scorpiomoon/comments/1nc86u8/linguine_arc_matrix/,Linguine arc matrix,"Saturn woke up the morning after his ceremony with mixed feelings. He looked marvelous, however felt guilty about denouncing his daughter's soul. She was peacefully sleeping in the other room of his family's treehouse and had yet to be informed of her fate. Saturn has always struggled to uphold promises and integrity.  

Saturn's wife, Storm, loves him to pieces, while he periodically messes around with other lemurs. She has known for years, but refuses to do anything due to deeply held beliefs on the sacred nature of marriage. His daughter, named Elsa, works hard in school and has a loving heart. So, what’s Saturn's role in his family trio?  He “works hard” to bring home the bacon by selling coffee beans to merchants from the city. 

A lovely aroma of French roast filled the air of the kitchen as Elsa woke up. She walked into the room to find Saturn sitting down and reading the Banana Bulletin. 

Politely, she interrupted him and asked for a cup of coffee. Saturn obliged. Sitting together, they waited for Storm to return with breakfast from the local bistro. Following a long pause, Saturn had to tell Elsa what he’d done. 

He explained that she means the world to him but he felt pulled by his intense obsession with his own appearance. He then told Elsa how this caused him to spend his savings on acquiring special scrolls to achieve his agenda. Finally, as Elsa began to doze off; Saturn laid out the fate her soul faced. To his surprise, she was furious! 

Slamming her fists on the counters in a bout of rage, she ran into the kitchen and grabbed a large wooden bat. Next, she started to charge towards Saturn! He felt immediately uneasy and even had to dodge Elsa's blow and grab the knife from her hands.

Saturn raised his hands in surrender, his chest rising and falling as Elsa swung the bat wildly..
“Elsa!” he shouted, his voice breaking. “Please stop. I know I’ve failed you, but you have to believe me, I never meant to hurt you.”

His words cut through her rage. Elsa’s grip trembled on the handle of the bat, her breath ragged, her eyes brimming with tears. Saturn gently reached forward, inch by inch, until he placed his hand over hers. Slowly, she lowered the weapon.

The air was heavy with silence when the door creaked open. Storm stepped inside, carrying a woven basket of fresh pastries, Elsa’s warm smile faded the instant she felt the tension in the air. She set the basket down, her eyes scanning between Saturn and Elsa.

“What happened here?” Storm asked, her voice sharp but quivering beneath the surface.
No one spoke. Saturn glanced down at the wooden floor, while Elsa’s tears spilled freely. Storm’s gaze hardened as the truth unraveled from her daughter’s trembling lips.

“He… 
he gave up my soul, Mama.”

Storm almost had a heart attack. For years, she had endured Saturn’s vanity, his affairs, his broken promises.

Without a word, she turned and stormed out of the treehouse. Elsa quickly ran after her, calling through sobs, “Wait!”

And then Saturn was alone.

He slumped into his chair, staring at the half-empty cup of coffee growing cold on the table. The silence pressed down on him, heavy and suffocating. 

His mind drifted back to his childhood, to the nights his mother trudged home from the factory, her fur covered in soot and her voice weary. 

She would look at him with disappointment, shaking her head.

“You’re turning into a horrible lemur, Saturn,” she would say, her words laced with a bitterness that never softened.

Back then, he had thought if he became beautiful enough—radiant enough—he could prove her wrong. He had spent his life chasing that illusion, sacrificing everything, even his family.

A rich aroma of French roast lingered in the background. Saturn buried his face in his paws, his reflection in the polished knife blade staring back at him, more hollow than handsome.

For the first time in years, Saturn felt the full weight of his choices & the love he had lost.

One piece of advice was to write down the things you want from a partner, and then give yourself those things. But I’m quite confused. What if the things you want (or the things that speak to your love language) are only things someone else can do? 

For example, I feel really loved when someone occasionally picks me up a small gift on the way home from work, or buys me a pen I was eyeing the previous weekend and gives it to me, or sends me a $5 gift card for coffee that morning. Nothing extravagant or too often. I also LOVE doing that kind of thing in return. But none of my partners have ever done that and my current one doesn’t either, but I also am not sure I can do it for myself necessarily?

For this kind of example - how would you implement loving yourself in this way? Or other examples such as a certain kind of intimacy that you can’t give yourself etc. ",1,1757387666.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

So we make plans for a second real date. We saw Weapons because we're both into thrillers (it was kickass) and then had a light dinner with drinks before we went back to her apartments. So things look like they're going really well when all of the sudden she gets a phone call that she says is really important and has to take but should be over fast. So she goes to her bedroom and leaves me in the living room watching Netflix. Well something you should know about me is that because of my ADHD I get really bored fast and like to snoop. So I resisted for a really long time trying to wait it out but after about 5 minutes I start walking around snooping through her bookcases and photos. I noticed one picture in particular looked weird and so I started trying to open up the back to see if there was any part cutoff by the frame or if it had any secret note.

Well of course she comes out mid me plying her picture open and acts like I'm being a complete psycho for being curious.

I am 1000% in full awareness that what I am about to say from my heart is irrational and goes against everything I stand by, as well as the poignant message of this show. But I also think I need to express a real, human feeling, one I am sure many of us are still experiencing to this very day. It would be a disservice not to remind each other that we are not droids. We are breakable, as breakable as the human spirit can be, at least. And it is fragile.

I am losing my faith. In good. In rebelling against fascist people and institutions. In raising awareness about causes that amplify humanitarian efforts. And more depressingly, in having even a fraction of faith that people are capable of change. Some people are just like Partagaz, or debatably Mon's driver, Cloris, in 2x9. That is why I am grateful for this show, because it does not always follow the “villain to hero” redemption arc. Fascists will remain fascists no matter what. And yet… surely that cannot be true for everyone? Yes, brainwashing is difficult to shed. If you have grown up in occupied Palestinian territories and you are an Israeli Zionist, you have been conditioned to perceive indigenous Palestinians as inferior. You’ve been told that land was granted to you centuries ago by “God,” for pillaging and taking, and that because your grandparents suffered one of the worst genocides in human history, inflicting one of your own is somehow justified, even if it means spitting on their graves and dishonoring their memory. This propaganda can’t be shed overnight.

And yet... we are living in an age more saturated than ever with access to information. Access to dissent. Access to perspectives that can help us discern whether the beliefs we grew up with should be discarded. And still, these people— fascists — are adamant in their hate, adamant in wanting innocent human beings dead. Why???

It has reached the point where I have to remind myself that what I am doing is only venting and is not making much difference. I am not on the Gaza flotilla, which was, just today, struck by an Israeli drone. What have I done but vent lately? Because the truth is, I am tired. And now I am tired even of the one thing I can do all day if I wanted to: I am tired of venting. Of explaining to people why a Palestinian child does not deserve to be radicalized because he or she grew up without parents who were murdered. Why that child, that baby, does not deserve to be bombed and tortured. Why anyone who believes otherwise is a venomous human being. Sick to the brim.

I am losing it. I am losing my faith. And I know it is irrational. As Kleya would tell me: “Let me guess… it's too hard 😢.” But I will get over it. Maybe after another cup of coffee. I have been through a lot this week anyway, but people are going through genocide. They are going through far worse. And in a twisted way, that gives me solace, that I am not enduring it. But it also means I must sober up and not take my privilege for granted. I'm tired, but who isn't? As Norman Finkelstein would say: boo fucking hoo. Does that make me exempt? No! Should I let that shatter whatever is remaining of my faith? I hope not. I'm not trying not to let it.

Come to think of it, I feel much better now. Thank you for letting me spitball. I am going to go outside again; doom scrolling has a tendency to be counterproductive (no scratch that, it *is* counterproductive). I hope you all have a great day. Much love and appreciation to you all.

1nc83mn,https://www.reddit.com/r/AeroPress/comments/1nc83mn/proscons_of_xl/,Pros/Cons of XL?,"Hi All! I'm considering upgrading to an XL from an original Aeropress. Is the quality of the cup the same? I do not weigh my grounds or measure my hot water temperature, just go by a coffee measure and when the  electric kettle has stopped boiling. So the perfect cup is not necessarily the point, but the ease of use.

Does clear vs original matter? Should I expect it to be any different from using the original other than making more extract? Can I still use the inverted method (I've never had an explosion)? 

Main reason to make the purchase is to simply make more and better coffee at one time. My husband makes himself french press coffee and drinks two cups about an hour before I get up. I get the last cup that he sets aside for me when I get up, and french press coffee does not do that well sitting in the mug. I don't mind that it usually gets cold, though. Usually prefer it, honestly. But the Aeropress cuppa is just much superior IMHO and we'd get the bonus of fewer oils using a paper filter.

1nc83ap,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1nc83ap/should_i_reach_out_to_a_friend_after_falling_out/,Should I reach out to a friend after falling out?,"One of my best friends and I had a falling out about two years ago. We’ve been friends since we were 15, and now we’re both in our early 30s. It’s been a long friendship, and not the first time we’ve had issues, but usually we resolved them. This time we didn’t. For some context: we grew up in the same city but went to college in different places. Even then we stayed close, writing letters and spending time together during breaks. After college, she moved back home and I stayed in my city. Later, she moved to a different town and I visited her there. In 2022 she moved to my city, and I helped her find an apartment. From the day she arrived, I was at her place helping her unpack. I introduced her to my friends, some of whom she already knew from past visits. That’s when a lot of our issues started.

We had never lived in the same city as adults before, and I think she was frustrated that I wasn’t always available. I was living with my now fiancé, but I felt responsible for showing up whenever she wanted to hang out. She started spending time with my friends without me, which didn’t bother me, but sometimes I felt left out and jealous when they made memories together. Most of the time we all hung out as a group. At the same time, I felt like our personalities were drifting. We argued because I felt she was virtue signaling or being overly general in ways that felt polarizing.

There was one party where a friend of my fiancé’s yelled at her for the above, which was not okay. I suggested we leave - I felt so bad and he did later apologize but she then held onto resentment that I had not argued with him on her behalf after he yelled, and instead suggested that we go home. When I was apartment-hunting in her neighborhood, she helped me, but later, in fights, said she felt used because she thought we weren’t as close anymore. I think both of us avoided sharing frustrations directly, which meant resentment built up.

The major falling out happened on her birthday trip abroad. Before the trip we had argued but seemed to be repairing things. I even got coffee with her to ask if she really wanted me there. She said yes and I apologized for my part in our earlier tiff. On the trip, though, things unraveled. She had planned poorly and was upset about how it was going. One night at karaoke, I sang first and then stepped outside for air. My two friends followed me, which upset her. She thought I was trying to make everyone leave. I explained I wasn’t, but she didn’t believe me. At the next bar she began ignoring me. I left early that night because I didn’t want to be blamed for something I hadn’t done. The rest of the trip was tense. She didn’t speak to me directly, only to others. I tried to keep the peace, but on the way home I learned she had been talking badly about me to her other friends, saying she only invited me so that my two friends would come. After the trip, we never spoke again. She did reach out to my two friends, but when she tried to bring me up, they changed the subject and wouldn’t engage.

The issue is that I’m getting married in a month. This whole year of wedding planning has me feeling extremely nostalgic, and given me a lot of perspective on the people in my life, my true friendships and those that don’t matter as much anymore. I’m torn by how awfully things ended with me and this friend. I’ve had two years to think about all the reasons why she wanted to blame me for how badly the trip went, the trying to connect and talk badly about me to my other friends, the resentment, and I concluded everytime that we were frustrated with how our friendship was developing but I still have a lot of love for her. It makes me so sad to think she won’t be there for my wedding, and I want to reconnect but then when I think about what all went down I get frustrated and upset again.

Should I even bother to reach out, or were we just fighting for a friendship that has naturally seen its course? When I think about her now, I can only remember the good times, the memories we made when we were 15 and silly, not the frustration in our early 30s.",1,1757387497.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

1nc7xp1,https://youtu.be/ua7bcbQ0psA,4 Very Scary TRUE Remote Farm Property Horror Stories,"# ""The Farm Gate"":

I pulled up to the old farm gate around dusk, my truck rumbling over the gravel like it was chewing rocks. The place was way out in the countryside, miles from the nearest town, surrounded by nothing but fields and woods that seemed to swallow the light. I'd known Jake from high school; he was that rich kid who always had cash and connections. Lately, he'd been texting about good deals on weed, saying he had a hookup on his family's property. Sounded easy enough—buy a couple ounces, head home. My buddy Ryan came along, figuring we'd split the cost and smoke later.

Jake waved from the porch of the big barn-like house, his smile wide under that messy hair. He looked the same as always, tall and broad, wearing a faded t-shirt and jeans covered in dirt. ""Alex! Ryan! Get in here,"" he called, his voice carrying across the yard. We parked and hopped out, grabbing our backpacks. The air smelled like hay and engine oil, and the farm equipment loomed in the shadows—tractors, a backhoe, piles of tires stacked like forgotten toys.

We followed him inside the house, which was more like a workshop than a home, with tools scattered on tables and empty bottles on the counter. His cousin Ben was there, lounging on a couch with a beer, nodding at us. Ben was quieter, skinny with sharp eyes, the kind that watched everything without saying much. ""You guys want a drink first?"" Jake asked, cracking open sodas from the fridge. We said sure, settling at the kitchen table. Ryan pulled out the cash, counting bills while Jake talked about how his folks owned all this land, how he ran the place now that they were away.

The conversation started normal. Jake bragged about fixing up an old ATV out back, showed us pictures on his phone of him riding it through the fields. Ryan laughed, asking if we could take a spin later. Ben just smirked, sipping his drink slowly. But then Jake's tone shifted a bit. He leaned in, lowering his voice like he was sharing a secret. ""You know, this farm's got spots nobody knows about. Buried treasures and all that."" We chuckled, thinking he meant junk from years ago. He went on about how he'd dug up old stuff once, bones from animals or something, and how it made him feel powerful, like he controlled everything out here.

I glanced at Ryan, who raised an eyebrow but kept smiling. Jake pulled out a baggie from a drawer—decent green, smelled strong. ""This is top stuff,"" he said, weighing it on a scale. We haggled a little on price, Ryan pushing for a discount since it was just us. Ben stood up then, pacing to the window, looking out at the darkening yard. ""Hurry it up,"" he muttered to Jake. Jake shot him a look, then turned back to us with that grin again. ""No rush. We're good here.""

That's when I noticed the gun. It was on the counter, half-hidden under a rag, a shiny revolver that caught the kitchen light. My stomach tightened, but I told myself it was for protection—farms had coyotes or whatever. Jake saw me looking and laughed. ""Don't worry about that. Just in case."" He slid the baggie over, taking the money. Ryan pocketed it, standing to leave. ""Cool, man. Thanks. We'll hit you up next time.""

But Jake didn't move. He blocked the door a little, his body filling the frame. ""You sure that's all? I got more if you want."" Ryan shook his head, polite but firm. ""Nah, we're set."" Ben stepped closer now, his hands in his pockets, eyes locked on Ryan. The room felt smaller, the air thicker. Jake's smile faded just a touch. ""Come on, stay a minute. I wanna show you the back field. Got a fire pit going.""

I didn't like it. Something in his voice, the way Ben hovered—it wasn't right. ""Maybe next time,"" I said, edging toward the door. Ryan nodded, following me. Jake put a hand on Ryan's shoulder, squeezing. ""Relax, dude. We're friends."" Ryan shrugged it off, but Jake's grip tightened. ""What's your problem?"" Ryan asked, voice steady but annoyed.

In a blink, Jake shoved Ryan hard against the wall. The soda cans rattled off the table. ""You think you can just take my stuff and go?"" Jake snarled, his face twisting. Ben lunged, grabbing Ryan's arms from behind. I froze for a split second, then yelled, ""What the hell? Let him go!"" Jake turned to me, eyes wild, pulling the gun from the counter. ""Shut up, Alex. You saw too much.""

Ryan struggled, kicking at Ben. ""Get off me!"" he shouted. The gun went off—bang, deafening in the small space. Ryan jerked, blood blooming on his shirt. He gasped, sliding down the wall. I backed up, heart racing, hands up. ""Jake, stop! We're leaving!"" But he aimed at me next, finger on the trigger. Ben was on the floor now, wrestling Ryan, who was wheezing, trying to crawl away.

I didn't think—I just ran. Shoved past Jake, burst through the door into the yard. Footsteps pounded behind me. ""Alex! Get back here!"" Jake bellowed. I sprinted for my truck, keys fumbling in my pocket. Another shot cracked the air, whizzing past my ear. I dove into the cab, slamming the door, engine roaring to life. Tires spun on gravel as I peeled out, glancing in the mirror. Jake stood there, gun raised, Ben dragging something—Ryan?—back inside.

I drove like mad, hands shaking on the wheel, not stopping until I hit the highway. Called the cops from a gas station, words tumbling out. They found Ryan's body later that night, shot twice, dragged to the barn. Jake and Ben confessed days after, talking about how it started over the money but spiraled. They'd done it before, luring guys out here for deals that turned deadly. Buried the others in shallow graves behind the fields, using the backhoe to cover their tracks. The farm was their trap, isolated enough that screams didn't carry.

I still drive by that road sometimes, can't help it. The gate's chained now, house empty. But at night, I hear that bang in my dreams, see Ryan's face. Out there, alone, nobody hears you.





# ""Footsteps in the Attic"":

I took the job at the old farm because it paid steady, and I needed work after losing my spot in town. The place sat way out in the country, miles from any neighbors, just fields and woods closing in around it. The owner, Mr. Gruber, was a sturdy man in his sixties with a face like weathered wood. He shook my hand firm when I showed up and said, ""You'll sleep in the loft above the barn. Earn your keep with the chores."" His wife nodded from the doorway, her eyes sharp but quiet. Their daughter, Viktoria, lived there too with her two kids—a girl about seven and a little boy just learning to walk. The family kept to themselves, but they seemed solid enough.

My first week went smooth. I fixed fences, hauled hay, and milked the cows before dawn. The attic above the main house creaked sometimes at night, but I figured it was the wind or mice. One evening, as I shoveled out the stalls, Viktoria came by with a basket of bread. ""You settling in?"" she asked, her voice soft. I wiped my hands and took a piece. ""Yes, ma'am. Quiet out here."" She smiled a bit. ""Too quiet sometimes. Father found footprints last winter, leading right to the back door. Thought it was a tramp, but nothing missing."" I nodded, not thinking much of it. Farms get wanderers now and then.

A few days later, Mr. Gruber called me over while I was mending the roof. He held up a newspaper, crumpled and old. ""Look at this,"" he said, his brow furrowed. ""From the city, Munich. None of us get that here. Found it under the porch steps."" I took it, scanning the headlines about city folk and politics. ""Strange,"" I replied. ""Maybe the wind blew it from the road."" He shook his head. ""Road's too far. And the lock on the machine shed—it's busted now. Someone's been poking around."" His wife overheard from the kitchen window and added, ""We heard steps in the attic last night. Like boots on the boards."" I felt a prickle on my neck but kept my face steady. ""I'll check the doors tonight, make sure they're latched.""

That night, after everyone turned in, I grabbed a lantern and climbed to the attic in the main house. The air up there was thick with dust, and the beam swung shadows across old trunks and tools. Nothing moved. I called out, ""Anyone there?"" My voice echoed back empty. Just as I turned to go, a soft thump came from the far corner—like something shifting. I held the light high, but saw only cobwebs. Heart racing a little, I hurried down and bolted the hatch. Back in the barn loft, I lay awake, listening to the house settle. No more sounds, but sleep didn't come easy.

The next morning, Mr. Gruber seemed on edge. Over breakfast in the kitchen—porridge and cheese—he said to me, ""Keep an eye out today. That newspaper bothers me. And the footprints—I'll show you."" After eating, he led me to the edge of the property, where snow from a recent flurry still clung to the ground. Sure enough, boot prints trailed from the woods straight to the machine room door. Fresh ones, deeper than mine. ""See that?"" he muttered. ""Not ours. Someone's watching the place."" Viktoria joined us, holding her son's hand. The boy babbled and pointed at the tracks. ""Like a game,"" she said, but her laugh was forced. ""Maybe it's just the neighbor kids."" Mr. Gruber grunted. ""Kids don't break locks.""

I spent the day patrolling the fences, rifle slung over my shoulder—just in case. The woods felt thicker, like eyes peered from the trees. Around noon, the little girl ran up while I was splitting wood. ""Uncle,"" she called me that already, ""come see the attic. Mama says there's a secret up there."" I set down the axe. ""What kind of secret?"" She tugged my hand. ""Noises. Like whispering."" Her mother called from the house, ""Cäzilia, leave him be!"" But I followed her inside anyway, curiosity pulling me. Up in the attic again, the girl pointed to a loose board. I pried it up, finding only dirt and a rusted nail. No whispers, but as we descended, a faint scrape echoed from above—like nails on wood. I glanced back, but the ladder was still.

That evening, the new maid arrived. Her name was Maria, a woman in her forties with a tired smile. Mr. Gruber introduced us at the door. ""She starts tonight,"" he said. Maria nodded. ""Glad to be here. Heard the farm needs help."" We all sat for supper—stew from the pot, bread fresh baked. Talk was light at first, about the cows and the coming spring. But then Mrs. Gruber leaned in. ""You know about the attic?"" she asked Maria. The maid paused. ""The old one quit over it, they say."" Mr. Gruber waved it off. ""Nonsense. Just old house settling."" But Viktoria looked at me across the table. ""You heard it too, didn't you?"" I admitted, ""Something up there, yes. But probably rats."" Maria shivered slightly. ""I'll stay in the downstairs room, thank you.""

Sleep evaded me again that night. Around midnight, a low moan carried from the house—like wind through a crack, but steadier. I sat up in the loft, straining to hear. Then footsteps. Slow, deliberate, crossing the attic floor. Thump, thump. Not rats. I slipped on my boots and grabbed the lantern, heart thumping hard. Creeping to the barn door, I peered toward the house. A figure? No, just the outline of the chimney. But the steps continued, fading then returning. I thought of waking Mr. Gruber, but what if it was nothing? What if I looked foolish?

By morning, tension hung thick. Mr. Gruber gathered us in the yard. ""We're not imagining this,"" he said, voice low. ""Someone's been in the attic. I found straw from up there on the floor below."" Maria wrung her hands. ""Should we call the sheriff?"" He shook his head. ""Too far out. Takes a day to get here. We'll handle it."" Viktoria hugged her kids close. ""What if they come down?"" The little boy whimpered, and she shushed him. I spoke up. ""Let me sleep in the house tonight. Guard the stairs."" Mr. Gruber agreed. ""Good. Rifle ready.""

As dusk fell, I moved my things inside, bedding down near the attic hatch with the gun across my lap. The family retired early, lights out one by one. Hours passed in quiet, the clock ticking on the wall. Then it started—a soft rustle from above, like clothing brushing floorboards. I gripped the rifle, whispering to myself to stay calm. The rustle grew to pacing, back and forth. Closer to the hatch. A creak, as if weight shifted on the ladder. I raised the barrel, finger on the trigger. ""Who's there?"" I called, voice barely above a breath.

Silence answered. Then a knock—three slow raps on the wood from above. My blood ran cold. Not wind, not rats. Someone was up there, playing with us. I fired a warning shot into the ceiling, the bang echoing through the house. Shouts came from the rooms—Mr. Gruber yelling, ""What is it?"" Viktoria crying out for the kids. I yelled back, ""In the attic! Get out!"" Chaos followed. Doors banged open, feet pounded down the hall. I kicked the hatch wide, lantern high, but the attic gaped empty, dust swirling. No one.

We all huddled in the kitchen, lanterns flickering. Mr. Gruber clutched his own gun. ""You saw nothing?"" I shook my head. ""Heard knocking. Like he wanted me to know."" Maria sobbed quietly. ""I can't stay. This place is cursed—no, wait, not cursed. Just wrong."" Viktoria comforted her son. ""We leave at dawn. Pack now."" But Mr. Gruber stood firm. ""No. This is our home. We'll board the attic and wait for light.""

I couldn't shake the feeling that eyes watched from every dark corner. As the night dragged, whispers seemed to drift from the walls—not words, but breaths. Close. Too close. When the first gray light crept in, I bolted for the door. ""I'm going for help,"" I told them. Mr. Gruber nodded grimly. ""Hurry."" I ran down the path, not looking back, the farm shrinking behind me. Miles later, I reached the nearest town and fetched the law. But by the time we returned, it was too late. The family—gone. Bodies in the barn, stacked like cordwood, struck down with the mattock from the loft. The killer had waited, fed the animals, even lit the fire. And the attic? Empty, but for a single boot print in the dust.

I still wake to those footsteps sometimes, wondering if he ever left.





# ""The Burn Pile"":

I drove up that long dirt road one afternoon, figuring the farm job would be a fresh start. My truck rattled over the ruts, and the place came into view—a big old house with barns scattered around, horses grazing in the fields. The ad had promised room and board for hard work, and I was low on cash after losing my last gig. A woman stepped out onto the porch as I parked, waving me over. She looked to be in her forties, tall and slim, with sharp eyes and a smile that seemed too wide.

""You must be here for the help position,"" she said, extending her hand. ""I'm Sheila. Come on in, let's talk.""

Her grip was firm, almost too tight. Inside, the house smelled of hay and something sweeter, like old perfume mixed with smoke. She led me to the kitchen, poured coffee without asking, and sat across from me at the table. We chatted about my background—I told her I'd worked on ranches before, knew how to mend fences and care for animals. She nodded, her eyes never leaving my face.

""I run this place alone now,"" she said. ""My husband passed years ago. It's a lot, but I manage. You seem strong. Can you start tomorrow?""

I agreed right then. The pay was decent, and the isolation didn't bother me. I liked the quiet. She showed me to a small room upstairs, sparse with a bed and a dresser. ""Make yourself at home,"" she said. ""Supper's at seven.""

That first night, I ate with her in the dining room. She talked nonstop—about the horses, the neighbors who kept to themselves, how God had guided her to this life. Her voice had an edge, like she was reciting lines from a script. I kept my responses short, focusing on my plate of stew and bread.

The work started early. I mucked stalls, fed the animals, fixed a broken gate by the back pasture. Sheila watched from the porch most days, calling out instructions. ""Over there, by the fence. That's it."" She praised me when I did well, but her compliments felt off, like they hid something sharper. One morning, as I hauled water to the troughs, she walked up close.

""You're doing good,"" she said, her hand brushing my arm. ""Most boys run off after a week. But you... you stay.""

I nodded, uncomfortable with how she lingered. ""Just need the job,"" I replied.

By the end of the first week, I noticed odd things. Tools left out of place, like someone had been in the barn after me. Footprints in the soft dirt near the house that weren't mine. I mentioned it once over lunch.

""Probably raccoons,"" she said, laughing it off. ""This place is full of critters. Don't worry about it.""

But her laugh didn't reach her eyes. That night, I heard noises—scraping sounds from downstairs, like metal on wood. I lay in bed, listening, but when I got up to check, the house was still. Sleep came slow after that.

A couple weeks in, another guy showed up. He was younger than me, maybe twenty, with a backpack and a nervous look. Sheila introduced him as Ken, said he was here to help too. We shook hands in the yard.

""Glad to have company,"" I said.

He smiled faintly. ""Yeah. She seems nice.""

We worked side by side that day, repairing a shed roof. Ken was quiet at first, but as we nailed boards, he opened up. ""I answered her ad online. Said she needed hands for the farm. My folks kicked me out, so...""

I understood. ""It's steady here. Just watch the burn pile out back—she's always adding to it.""

He glanced toward the field where smoke sometimes rose. ""What's she burn?""

""Trash, mostly. Old papers, farm waste.""

That evening, Sheila cooked a big meal for the three of us. She sat between us at the table, pouring wine she insisted we drink. ""To new friends,"" she toasted.

Ken took a sip and coughed. ""Strong stuff.""

She leaned toward him. ""You'll get used to it. Tell me about yourself, Ken. What brings a boy like you here?""

He shifted in his seat. ""Just need work. Like he does."" He nodded at me.

Sheila's smile tightened. ""Everyone has secrets. God sees them all.""

The conversation turned strange after that. She talked about her past—modeling in New York, a bad marriage, how faith saved her. Then she fixed her gaze on Ken. ""You ever do wrong to little ones? Be honest now.""

Ken's fork paused midway to his mouth. ""What? No, ma'am.""

""Good,"" she said, patting his hand. ""I can't abide that. It's why I'm here—to set things right.""

I exchanged a look with Ken, but he just stared at his plate. After dinner, she sent him to the barn for a task, then turned to me. ""He's troubled. I can tell. But I'll help him, like I help you.""

Her words stuck with me. That night, the scraping sounds returned, louder, from the direction of the basement. I got up, flashlight in hand, and crept downstairs. The kitchen was empty, but the door to the cellar stood ajar. A faint smell wafted up—burnt meat and chemicals. I called out softly. ""Hello?""

No answer. I shone the light down the stairs. Shadows played on the walls, but nothing moved. Heart racing, I closed the door and locked it, then went back to bed. Morning came, and Ken was gone from his room. Sheila said he left early for town, but his backpack still sat by the door.

Days passed without word from him. I asked Sheila about it while we fed the horses. ""Ken coming back?""

She didn't look up from the bucket she carried. ""He wasn't right for this place. God told me.""

Her tone chilled me. I started paying closer attention. The burn pile grew higher, smoke curling up in thin wisps even when she wasn't adding to it. One afternoon, I found a wallet in the barn loft—Ken's, with his ID inside. I pocketed it, unsure what to do.

That evening, Sheila called me to the porch. ""Sit with me,"" she said. The sun dipped low, painting the fields gold. She sipped her drink, staring out. ""You've been here a month now. Do you like it?""

""It's work,"" I said carefully. ""But yeah.""

She turned to me, eyes intense. ""I see things in people. Sins they hide. Like with Ken. He confessed to me—touched kids, hurt them. I had to stop him.""

My mouth went dry. ""What do you mean?""

""God's work,"" she whispered. ""I burn away the evil. You understand, don't you?""

I stood up slowly. ""I think I should go.""

Her hand shot out, grabbing my wrist. ""No. You're good. Stay.""

I pulled free and backed toward the door. ""I need to think.""

Inside, I grabbed my things, heart hammering. As I headed for the stairs, I heard her voice from below. ""Don't leave me alone here.""

I didn't answer. In the yard, I threw my bag in the truck and drove off fast, gravel flying. But halfway down the road, I stopped. Ken's wallet burned in my pocket. I turned back, parking out of sight behind the trees.

Creeping to the burn pile, I waited until dark. Sheila went inside, lights flicking on. The pile smoldered, embers glowing. I poked at it with a stick, and something hard emerged—a bone, charred but human-sized. Then another. My hands shook as I dug deeper, finding a ring that matched one Ken wore.

Sirens wailed in the distance—someone must have called. I ran to my truck and got away, driving straight to the police station two towns over. I handed over the wallet and told them everything. They went to the farm that night.

Sheila was arrested. They found remains in the burn pit, and more in the basement. Ken's body, and another man's from before. She confessed to killing them, said God commanded it because they were bad. They think she did more, boys who came and never left.

I still see that farm in my dreams—the smoke, her eyes. I got out, but the fear stays.





# ""The Silence"":

I woke up that morning with the usual list of chores running through my mind. The farm had been our life for over four decades, just me, my wife, and the endless rows of maize stretching out from our house. My parents lived in the smaller place down the path, close enough to walk but far enough that it took a few minutes. They were getting older, but still stubborn about handling things on their own. That Sunday was Mother's Day, and we'd planned a simple lunch together. Nothing fancy, just some meat on the braai and time to talk.

My wife and I started the day early, like always. She was in the kitchen, chopping vegetables, while I checked the irrigation lines outside. Around ten, I called my parents to confirm they'd be over after church. My father picked up, his voice steady as ever. ""We'll see you at noon, son,"" he said. ""Your mother is looking forward to it."" I could hear her in the background, laughing about something small. It felt normal, the kind of call that happens every week.

But as the morning dragged on, a quiet worry started to creep in. Church usually ended by eleven, and they were only a short drive away. By eleven-thirty, my wife noticed too. ""Where are they?"" she asked, glancing at the clock while setting the table. I shrugged it off at first. ""Traffic, maybe. Or they stopped for something."" But deep down, I knew better. The area had been tense lately. We'd heard stories from neighbors—strangers lurking near gates at night, gates left open, tools missing from sheds. Farm attacks weren't rare here; they happened too often, and everyone whispered about them over coffee. My father had even installed extra locks last month, muttering about how things were changing.

Noon came and went. The food was ready, but the table stayed empty. My wife paced a little, her hands twisting a dishcloth. ""Call them again,"" she said. I did, but the phone just rang and rang, no answer. That knot in my gut tightened. ""I'm going to check on them,"" I told her. She nodded, her face pale. ""Be careful. Take your phone."" I grabbed it and headed down the path, the dirt crunching under my boots. The farm was quiet, just the rustle of leaves in the breeze and the distant hum of a tractor from another property. Our place was isolated, miles from the main road, which was why we loved it—and why it scared me sometimes.

As I walked, I scanned the area. My father's car was there, parked right by the house, like he'd come straight home from church. That didn't make sense. Why hadn't he called? The front door was ajar, just a crack, but something about it looked wrong. I pushed it open slowly, calling out, ""Dad? Mom? It's me."" No response. The living room was a mess—cushions knocked over, a lamp tipped on its side. My voice echoed a bit, too loud in the stillness. I stepped further in, my shoes sticking slightly to the floor. That's when I saw it: a dark smear on the wall, like paint, but thicker. Blood. My mind raced, but I pushed forward, telling myself it could be anything.

The kitchen was worse. Drawers pulled out, papers scattered. Then I noticed the back door—splintered, like someone had forced it with something heavy. An axe, maybe, from the shed. ""Dad!"" I shouted again, louder. Still nothing. I moved to the hallway, my breath coming short. The bedroom door was closed, but a faint metallic smell hung in the air, sharp and wrong. I turned the knob, and it swung open.

What I saw next will stay with me forever. My parents lay on the floor, not moving. My father on his back, eyes staring at the ceiling, his shirt soaked red. My mother face down beside him, her hair matted. Their hands were bound behind them with cord from the curtains, twisted tight. Blood pooled around them, thick and dark, soaking into the rug. I dropped to my knees, reaching for my father first. His skin was cold, no breath. Then my mother—still a little warm, but her neck... oh God, her neck was cut deep, an iron cord wrapped around it like a noose. I touched her wrist, searching for a pulse, but there was none. Flies were already buzzing in from the open window.

I backed away, my hands shaking, covered in their blood. Who could do this? Robbers, maybe—they'd taken his guns from the cabinet, some cash from the drawer, his laptop. But this wasn't quick. They'd tied them up, made them wait, terrified. I could picture it: my parents coming home, hearing the noise, thinking it was an animal or wind. Then the door breaking, men rushing in, masks or no, demanding things. My father would have fought, I know he would. ""Get out,"" he'd say, voice firm. But there were probably more than one, overpowering him. My mother screaming, ""Fanie, help!"" as they dragged her. The sounds—grunts, thuds, her pleas cut short.

I stumbled out of the room, dialing the police with bloody fingers. ""My parents... they're dead,"" I choked out when they answered. The operator asked questions, but I could barely speak. My wife met me halfway down the path, running. ""What happened?"" she gasped. I pulled her close, not wanting to say it. ""They're gone. Someone got in."" She cried then, hard, and we waited together for the sirens, which seemed to take hours.

The police came, then detectives. They said it looked like the attackers waited inside, ambushing when my parents returned. No fingerprints, no clear tracks—the maizefields swallowed everything. Days later, they caught two men nearby, with some of the stolen items. But the trial dragged, and the full story never came out. Why our farm? Was it just opportunity, or something more? We'd heard talk of land grabs, anger boiling over. My father had voted a certain way, spoken out at meetings. Did that make us targets?

That night, after the bodies were taken, my wife and I sat in our kitchen, doors bolted, lights on. Every creak made us jump. ""What if they come back?"" she whispered. I held her hand. ""They won't. But we can't stay like this."" The farm felt poisoned now, every corner hiding threats. I sold it months later, moved to town. But the images don't fade—the blood, the cord, their bound hands. And the questions: What did my parents feel in those last minutes? Did they know help wouldn't come in time?

Years on, I still check locks twice, avoid isolated roads. That day stole more than lives; it stole peace. And in quiet moments, I wonder if another family is walking that path right now, calling out unanswered.",1,1757387013.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

Idk if the NSFW tag was super necessary for this post, but better safe than sorry!
	
I used to love leaf-cutter ants. I grew up on a farm in the southern United States, and I would watch those little critters carry leaves all the way from a tree back to their colony. At the time, I didn’t know about their symbiotic relationship with certain species of fungi, but I found it intriguing nonetheless. Now, they just bring an uneasy feeling to my stomach. I ran away from that place long ago, but sometimes I still see him when I close my eyes. I still see the ants. I still see it.
	
My father was a working man. A corn farmer specifically. He was certainly far from perfect, but he valued family and was an incredibly driven worker. ”Someone’s gotta do it dammit.” That was his not-so-silent mantra he would half mutter to himself over coffee every morning. Sometimes, I could swear I saw some sort of remorse in his eyes, which always confused me. Was he so concerned for the fields he would plow? Did he hold sorrow in his empty heart for the ears of corn he would husk and shill off at the next farmer’s market? Of course, I know now it’s not the field he would pre-emptively mourn.
	
My mother was chronically ill. She would faint often. Her spouts were bi-polar in nature, and immensely concerning for the young boy I was. She would seem on the brink of a grisly, feverish death one night, fainting so often she was conscious as long as she was unconscious. Then she’d be as chipper as the songbirds the next morning. She had these swings constantly throughout my entire memory of her. The times she wasn’t sick were amazing. She was a wonderful mother, even though you could see the sickness gripping her measly, starved body even in her healthier moments. Her stature combined with my father’s grisly attitude made our household cold and uninviting to outsiders. We never did have many guests.
	
This is how I became friends with the ants. There were a lot of species out where we lived, but my favorite was by far the leaf-cutters. My fascination grew to such extremes that it was all I would ask my science teachers at school about, all my parents would hear about when they asked what I was doing outside, and most of what I read about. My fascination with these insects was almost irrational. Oddly enough, the fascination seemed two sided. All around our little farm there were hundreds of leaf-cutter colonies. 

They especially loved our barn. To my young mind, that made no sense. Why would these ants, who depend on leaves for existence, prefer to reside in a place with so few leaves? My father didn’t like whenever I asked him such questions. He said it was pointless to be so curious about the goings-on of bugs. He never allowed me to do my own research either, seeing as the barn was off limits. “That’s where I keep my tools ya’heer? If I catchya in there, you’ll be real sorry, boy.”

One night I awoke to a wretched, wheezing moan coming from down the hall. It was a sound I knew all too well. My mother was sick again. This time it seemed like it might really be her last. The fever had been ravaging her for days and the nearest doctor was at least a day's ride away, if she’d even survive the ride there. I heard my father grumbling something I couldn’t make out fully before I heard their bedroom door open and then quietly shut. I watched through a crack in my door as he slowly tip-toed down the hall, a motion so unfamiliar to his large frame. He quickly glanced in my direction, and I scurried back under my sheets as carefully as I could, hoping he didn’t see me. I didn’t see anything else that night, but I could swear I heard the lock of the barn door clicking open right as I was falling asleep.

Many of my early years passed by just so. My mother would fall ill, each time seeming to get worse. My father would grumble and head out to the barn, and then my mother would be better the next morning. In my childish view of the world, I simply assumed that my mother would only get sick at night. That all changed when I was 14 and she began getting sick during the day.

We were out on our porch, drinking sun tea that my mother had been brewing all day, when she fainted. By this point in her life, she resembled a walking cadaver. Her skin was pulled tight against bone, her fingers resembled string beans tied loosely to marbles. I swear I could see the tendons in her flex and stretch every time she moved. Her hair had almost all fallen out, leaving nothing but a few patches, and towards the end of my time on the farm you could actually see her eyes beginning to sink into her skull. Despite all this, she only acted frail when she was sick. My father and I still loved her dearly, and I didn’t understand completely how abnormal this was.

After I helped my father get her into bed, I watched as he spoon fed her something vile. He pulled it out of a jar labeled “emergency” from his bedside table. It resembled semi-liquified rotten meat, and did not smell much better than it looked. He seemed to have forgotten I was there. I stood and  watched as he tenderly fed her every drop on the spoon, making sure none fell to waste on the sheets below. Every loose, fleshy chunk accounted for. Every rogue hair pushed into her hinged-open jaw. Every cough covered with a napkin to prevent unnecessary loss of nourishment. My mother was dead. That’s what I realized at that moment. She should be dead, at least. Standing there, watching her be fed this unholy amalgamation, with her mouth hung open, and her body unmoving except to cough. That cough, the one I had heard my whole life. I was now seeing the origin of it, as if the very depths of her soul were rejecting the bile my father was now forcing into her. She should be dead. I slowly closed the door and walked outside.

I didn’t get far. I found myself near the shed, entranced by a trail of leaf-cutter ants heading under the towering, locked doors. I sat there for what must have been hours, listening to that bone-shattering cough erupt from the house. The trail of ants seemed never-ending. I wonder if they felt tired? I wonder if they felt remorse each morning for the trees they would shred? I had a thought then that I had somehow never realized. The ants were trading life. They had the power to end the life of a plant, stripping it of every single leaf. They would then feed that plant to another organism. For the first time in my life I saw the ants as something other than harmless, driven workers. I slept outside that night.

The next morning I went to confront my father. I found nobody but my mother inside.
”Helloooooo, son!” Her cheery voice cooed from the kitchen

The smell of breakfast serenaded my senses. I rounded the corner to see her famished frame standing cockeyed over the burner. She beamed when I entered. Where I once saw a mother’s love, I now saw wrinkled, fragile skin pulled taught across blackened teeth. I saw bowed legs, barely holding what little weight was left above them. I saw a gut, bloated with the fumes of death, ready to be released. She looked worse now than ever. What was once excusable in my adolescent mind as a grave sickness, was now clearly something worse.

“Where is dad?” I asked, stepping closer.

”Oh! He had some errands to run. He’s down in town for now, ought to be back this evening.”

I heard her voice as I always had, but the closer I got, the more I noticed a distinct, rattling raspiness. The same raspiness that I hear in our old dairy cows before they pass. My father always called it the death rattle.

”One second Ma, I gotta grab something from my room. I’ll be right back” I said, hurriedly leaving the kitchen.

”When you get back, I need you to toast the bread!” I heard her wheeze as I left the room.

I was looking for one thing. The keyring my father keeps in his room. I needed to know what was really in our barn. I needed to know what he had been feeding the corpse of my mother to keep her alive. I rummaged as quietly as I could, anxiety gnawing at the back of my brain. I could hear my mother calling to me from down the hall, probably asking what was taking me so long. I found the keyring hidden under a book in my father’s bedside table, right next to the empty emergency jar.

I left the room and was headed for the front door when I heard her.

”Son?” She said in an inquisitive, yet serious tone. “What do you have there?” She asked, eyes falling downwards in their socket to glance at the keyring in my hand.

I began backing away, fully revealing my intentions to investigate the barn.

”Now you know, that barn is OFF LIMITS” she coughed up, gasping for air. “Your father would be beside himself if you ruined any of his nice equipment”

I turned and ran out the front door. I didn’t expect my mother to run after me. I quickly made it past the porch and hopped down off the steps. I landed awkwardly and twisted my ankle. Behind me I saw the scrawny frame of my mother hobbling after me at an unnatural pace. I watched in horror as she wretched and lurched forward, so desperate to stop me from reaching the barn. So desperate to stop me from seeing whatever was in there. I crawled backwards as my mother’s corpse gained ground on me. I saw her foot land half on the first step, twisting sideways with a wet pop. She yelped and fell hard. Her attempt to catch herself on her other leg produced a louder snap and I watched as her femur snapped out from under her skin, tearing it like dry paper. The bone was beyond yellowed and nearly black with rot. She landed on her arm, and with one last crack she was settled into place on the ground.

I began crawling backwards again, finally snapping out of my trance. I pulled myself up on a fence post, and turned again to look at my mother on the ground. I saw her lift up her arm at the shoulder, only for the tendons to snap at the elbow as her arm gave out. I watched her begin to drag herself through the grass of our front lawn. Each pull only giving her a quarter inch of progress, accompanied with cries of agony gargled up through bloodied coughs. I saw her try to dig her fingers into the dirt to gain leverage just to have the bones of her fingers crackle and snap. She reached up at me again, and everything from the elbow down hung limp and useless. She continued her desperate crawl.
I turned back towards the barn one last time. I gripped the key ring in my hand and stilled my restless nerves. It’s time to learn my family secret.

Surprisingly, the barn looked to hold nothing of note. All I saw was sunflower-colored beams of light coming through the gaps in the construction to coat the room in a natural light. But the smell was something else. A sweet smell almost, but combined with spoiled meat. It was so faint, yet it was the only thing my mind could focus on. I closed and latched the door behind me, and quickly searched for the origin.
	
Minutes later I found myself standing over a hatch that was nearly perfectly aligned with the seams of the wooden floor. I had to move a few hay bales to get to it, but I found it. My ant friends led me there. Lines and lines of hundred or even thousands of leaf-cutters poured into it through the nearby seam. I prepared myself for the worst and swung it open.
	
Nothing

Nothing that I could see at least. No ladder, no floor, no lights, just that awful smell. The smell and a faint voice repeating the same nearly silent, rattly whisper that I could never forget.

”Pater noster, qui es in caelis, sanctificetur nomen tuum…”
	
The Lord’s Prayer. At least that’s what I would come to find later. There are some denominations of Catholicism that still say the prayer in the original language. One of which was host to a religion-central group therapy session I tried to attend later in life. The words, the words that haunted my nightmares, had forced me to leave that meeting.
	
I tried my best to talk myself out of doing what I was about to do. I had little success though. I needed to know what was down there. I lowered my legs down first, searching for some foothold to no success. Then I lowered myself until I was only clinging to the very edge of the hatch. When I found no footholds there either, I let go, plunging myself into the abyss held beneath the barn.
	
I landed on what felt like sopping wet cobblestones. My landing was accompanied by a loud groan, but not from me. The floor itself seemed to have gotten the wind knocked out of it by my fall. There was nearly no light save what little was left above me from the hatch. I crawled along the wet stones to the edge of the wall. It had the same texture as the floor. I pulled myself upright and carefully searched for some clue, a light source, anything. I stumbled about for what felt like hours until I found it.
	
I found a man. At least, it felt like a man. I still couldn’t see anything, but my other senses felt more keen in the absence of one of the five. I ran my fingers along arms covered in hair, musculature similar to my own, but of a grown adult. I could feel a face, I felt eyes and eyelashes, a head of hair, ragged clothes with many holes in it. I felt him breathing. I felt his lips moving, attempting to form words. I felt him covered in fleshy stones and leaves. There were only two conflicting points that led me to believe it may not be a man. One was that he was completely soaking wet and warm to the touch despite being unresponsive. The other was that I could not find a point at which he ended and the floor began. I ran my hands along where his body should have ended and the floor should have begun, but I found no seam. It’s as if he had sunk into the floor, as if he was being consumed by it.
	
Just then, I heard the barn doors open. I heard my fathers familiar sounding footfalls rapidly approaching the place where I was now hiding. Fear gripped my stomach, whatever nerves I thought were fried beyond use were now firing again at high speed. He threw something down the hatch, and it landed next to me with a meaty thud, and the snap of bone breaking. The same gasp accompanied it as when I had landed.
	
My father then stomped away from the hatch, the illogical part of my brain thinking that he somehow didn’t see my mother, mangled and crawling through the lawn. Hoped against hope that he hadn’t noticed that the hatch was already open, and that the hay bales had been moved.
	
Of course, I was wrong. I knew I was wrong even before I heard the other hatch open. I heard the click of a door lock, and before I could even move I was blinded by the ruthless light of the sun. 
	
“Son” I heard the deep, grisly voice of my father say. “I told you that I had better never, EVER catch you in this damn barn.” I had never heard him speak so clearly. His southern drawl was still present, but the words were spoken with a seriousness unbeknown to me my entire life.
	
That’s when I saw what he had thrown in before coming down to fetch me. It was another man. He was covered in bloodied stab wounds, and his neck was bent backwards to reveal vertebrae sticking out through his neck, his head violently strewn to the side. Funny enough though, that’s not what caught my attention. I was more disturbed by the floor he had landed on.

Illuminated now by the light of the open door, every inch of the room that I could see was covered in a thick, firm viscera and a thin coating of leaves. Fragments of bone were mixed into the floors and walls, calcifying the room into place, acting as a foundation for the horrid creature. That’s what it was I realized. A beast. A horrid, living, breathing beast. I saw the outline of the first man I had found, his body completely engulfed by the room, with the thinnest, most recently formed layer being over his mouth. 
	
”DAD WHAT THE HELL IS THIS” I yelled at him.
	
”Watch your tone boy, and your mouth.”
	
“FUCK YO-“ I was cut off by him stepping forward and striking me across the face in one smooth motion.
	
”I don’t need to explain myself to you son. This is the way things are, like it or not” He said plainly, walking over to the edge of the wall and cutting a piece of it off with his knife and putting it into a large bowl.
	
”THIS? THIS IS WHAT YOU-“
	
“I feed it. It keeps her well.” He interrupted me again, motioning me to be quiet with his hand. “You’ve seen it. I know you have. That day she fainted in front of you and I forgot to close the door. It’s just the way things are. Someone has to do it.”
	
I stood there in shock, not sure what to say to my own father. Is this what he has felt remorse about each morning? How many innocent people has he fed to this monster?
	
”Now son, I know this may be hard to wrap ‘yer mind round” he said, his normal drawl coming back in “but I HAVE to do this. Yer ma, she’s… she ain’t well.”
	
”She’s dead, dad. She should have been dead a long time ago! This is unnatural. This isn’t right.”
	
“WHO GIVES A SHIT” he said, surprisingly upset by my previous statement. “Yer mother, I love her. I NEED her, son” I saw tears beginning to form in his eyes. “Not like ya’d really understand. Don’t have a wife of ‘yer own yet.”
	
”But I would never do this to her”
	
”You would” He barked “Think of it like cattle, son. You feed the cow, cow grows, ya eat the cow. This ain’t no different.”
	
”This is different dad. You are feeding this thing innocent people.”
	
“That man behind you is a rapist. The one behind him? Catholic priest, killed a member of his own congregation. Jesus, son. You think I’d do this to innocent people? Do you think I’m some kind of monster?”
	
”Yes” I sneered
	
”Well, sorry you see it that way” He sighed as he began to close the door, intending to leave me inside. Maybe he will come back for me later. Maybe not. I couldn’t take that risk.
	
As he turned I grabbed a lump of a jawbone I could see sticking out from the floor. Snapping it in half, I lunged forward and dug it into my father’s hamstring. He yelled and twisted around, hitting me across the head hard. We both rolled. I stood first and found the bowl he had been using to gather chunks of fleshy meat from the wall. I used it as a bludgeon and struck my father over the head. I kept hitting him until I could tell he was unconscious, his nose bent out of place and blood plastering the wet floor beneath his head. He was still alive, he was breathing at least. I turned and walked up the stairs he had come down to retrieve me. I locked the door on my way out. I followed the leaf-cutters up the stairs, each of them carrying a small, fleshy chunk.
	
I left home that day. I was 14 and it was hard living on my own at such a young age. I made it work though. Finding places to employ me as cheap labor and pay me under the table was surprisingly easy. I grifted like this for most of my teens and early twenties. I eventually met the most amazing woman and settled down in a house of our own. We had a daughter. Life treated me well, outside the PTSD and panic attacks any time anyone would get sick. Life was good.
	
Then the ants came back. First, just a few. I figured it was a new colony just starting up outside of our little house. Then within a week there were thousands, all flocking to our untouched tool shed in the backyard. I brushed it off as some odd coincidence. Probably some form of denial. Then, my wife began having fainting spells. I opened the shed to find a small viscera of misaligned bug legs and rat skulls. I knew what needed to be done. I knew I needed to feed it.",3,1757386789.0,creepcast,2,1.0,False
1nc7u9m,https://i.redd.it/digrqo9112of1.jpeg,A scar that reminds me of my first job,"I worked at Tim Hortons when I was 15 (I’m now 21), it was my first job. I worked there for a year and by far this was the most memorable moment among many. 

It was the middle of summer on an incredibly hot day and the line up was out the door. So what we do at a time like that is tag team at the counter, one person taking orders and doing cash, and the other preparing coffee/drinks/baked goods. I was on cash and my supervisor (let’s call her Jen) was on coffee. Jen was moving at lightning speed trying to get the orders done and so she was pulling filter baskets (the baskets that hold the coffee grounds) and pouring coffee two at a time, trying to get everything done efficiently. 

Jen put the big garbage can on her right and I was on her left, whereas usually we have the garbage can underneath the counter in front of us. I guess this was her way of making it easier and more efficient for her. 

So I’m taking orders and all of a sudden I feel a burning hot sensation all over my legs, ankles and feet… it was even in my underwear. Jen was moving so fast that she accidentally dumped two fresh HOT (78 degrees Celsius or so) baskets of coffee grinds all over my pants instead of into the garbage on her other side. The grounds spilled into my shoes and my burning hot pants stuck to my legs further allowing the heat to stick to my skin. 

I’m 15 and shocked so I start hyperventilating in pain in front of all the customers so the manager of the store comes out of her office, pulls me into the back and immediately pulls my pants down and starts running ice cubes down my legs, further damaging my skin. 

They gave me a short break, I filled out an incident report and went right back to work with bloodshot eyes from crying, having to face every coworker and customer that just witnessed what happened. I now have a big scar on my left leg that’s completely lost all feeling and a story to tell at family gatherings… I also didn’t get much of an apology from Jen.

I work long hours and the coffee shop just feels like a lifesaver to get through the day. By the time I get home, I’m too tired to cook or even think about a proper snack, so it keeps snowballing.
I’ve tried making coffee at home, prepping snacks, and even batching drinks for the week, but it never lasts more than a couple of days before I fall back into the same routine. Part of me wants to feel proud that I can treat myself, but another part just sees the numbers stacking up and panics.
I’ve started using little tools to help track spending and find small savings — things like FrugalFox AI, Honey, and Rakuten. It’s not a magic fix, but it helps me see where I might be overspending and makes me feel a bit more in control without giving up everything I enjoy.

I may be crazy, but I think there is something a bit hidden at the center of this. We all love a twist, don't we? The best, most satisfying twists are the ones where you look back and it all suddenly makes sense. It doesnt come out of nowhere. There are signs along the way that totally make sense in retrospect. I mean how great was The Usual Suspects? Pulp Fiction?One of the most masterful ones, and one of my favorite movies, is Memento. You've seen it, right? 

A few sly messages seem to be popping out the more I keep making maps and charts and graphs. 

And some funny (haha style and hmm, strange style) connections are appearing as well. Maybe they are in my head and I've cut them from whole cloth, but they seem to be reminiscent of a story we've already been told. 


Reminiscent, shiny, slippery, iridescent, playing in the light and casting shadows on the wall. A rainbow in a puddle of oil. The shimmer of Mother of Pearl in a shell. The sound of the ocean when you hold a conch up to your ear. A sign or signal that you can see but not hear, but maybe you can learn to understand. Things creeping at the edge of your vision, but seeming to disappear the moment you glance in their direction, or they scatter when you flip on the light. 


I have fully embraced the rabbit hole and fallen down the well. Haha. 


Perhaps the heart of what matters is a reason to be? The thing that moves us, that motivates us. 


A person or people to whom the book is dedicated, and perhaps whose words are also winking out at us from under JP's umbrella. I think a rose by any other name smells just as sweet, right? A rock, an anchor, a guiding star, a compass rose, and a way to get there. And the right gear to get us there as well. Something rising above the noise if we listen carefully. A grand old Victorian dame perched up on the mountain beckoning us home. A signal meted out deliberately and maybe patiently, that has to be picked up with the right equipment, so to speak. A rule book to guide us, and a web site where we can see the laws and regulations that can help us narrow things down. 


Maybe we have a bit of a confession, and a request that we read the confession and understand what the book is asking for, maybe forgiveness. After all if you're returning your tickets to get a prize, that's a redemption arc, isn't it? 


He broke his leg right before all this started. Is it the game we are playing, or is the game in play? 


I've got more notes than you could shake a stick at, and I think there are definite layers here, perennial, everlasting, hopefully infinite ans immemorial. It's all wrapped around what has grown from experience, careful tending, and patience, and time. It comes back every year, just like a reunion. 


A mixed up, shaken, not stirred story about bonds forged between brothers, of engineers of software and hardware, and the things that tie it all together which sprout from a single source. 


One test for alzheimers is to have the person draw a clock. It seems very simple, as we all understand clocks, don't we? We can draw them from memory. But not with alzheimers or dementia. It's a very difficult task, and often the person is unaware that they have not   passed. 



Are we not all spending our days trying to make sense of a clock? Maybe unaware of what is going on around us? The pendulum keeps swinging and the bells keep ringing and still we keep looking to the clock and to symbols to try to make sense of it all, only to feeel confusion, frustration, overconfidence, and even despair. It's just a clock! Why can't we figure it out? There is something missing. Hidden until found. 


If they are lost in their memories, in time, unmoored, then they may not be aware of why they are in a particular place, or why they are doing what they are doing. The brains response is to connect what IS familiar, and we have the remarkable ability to sort of create our own reality when dissociated either by disease or trauma or severe illness. 


Ive mentioned this before. When someone is close to death, they frequently will do the same. We flip back through our memories to frantically try to make sense of all the transmitters being released in our brains, and it seems like reality, just as valid and normal and sure as you or I or anyone still in full capacity would believe and perceive. But often it comes out very nonsensical, despite the person's insistence that they are totally fine and aware. 



This is the insidiousness of death and loss encroaching. They say that you're only dead after the last person who remembers you forgets or passes. Stories and legends help keep the people we love alive. 


But, as we would do with anyone struggling with memory loss and dissociation, I think maybe we have to connect not dots but maybe...wheels? Sort of. A clock, of sorts. Graphs with anchor points that all eventually relate back to a center hub, and maybe that will help us make sense of what the poem is asking us to do? 


But meanwhile, they are experiencing a different reality and misremembering details even though they are absolutely certain it's truth. And they just go with the flow, trying to make sense of why they are going here or there or being shuttled to and fro, what this new place is, and so on. So the brain sort of copes by creating almost a green screen type mental CGI, mostly to protect itself. But it's lost the capacity to perform validation checks on what is true, what is/is not. What is and/or. Kind of like a computer system that isn't indexed properly and can't reach the right path, because things are corrupted or there's just too much to sift through and like the cache needs to be cleared but it can't clean anything up. 


Sometimes that's how it feels trying to do research, you know? All this generative AI, lots of hallucination, an inability for it to perform exacting research and it floods major search engines without the ability to turn it off. And the SEO is crippled (or, well, in this case, buttressed to a very biased degree so that only certain information is easily found, by design.) Google and Microsoft have both been very seriously guilty of this monopolization, and it only gets worse and worse. People rely on this new AI tech to do their thinking for them and lose critical thinking skills for the sake of convenience, and a lot of folks just take it at its word despite most of them being basically really fancy autocorrect. Meanwhile the more searches are performed, the more discussions are had--ironically it starts to limit us to an invisible echo chamber where the keywords that folks accumulate and focus on stand in the way of forging our own paths. 



I don't know if any of this is right or wrong, but there do seem to be some stories hidden within stories, some hidden word play to discover, and maybe some secrets hidden within the layers. Like an onion--or whichever metaphor you may choose. 


But I do believe there is some wordplay to give you hints, even when not explicitly talking about particular geography, maybe? 


I think we are looking for the anchor in the ocean of time, a constant that keeps us on an even keel. Maybe at the center of this unsolved web of mystery lies one thing from which the rest of it sprawls? What is at the center of the spiral? What's in the eye of the storm?


I think now that we are looking to find a place where the beyond touches the map ever so delicately. A quiet place that connects eternity and now where one can put down what they are carrying and rest. I haven't found that place physically yet, although I do think there is one particular clue that stands out on this iteration that I'm going through now. This is probably just ine of many and i will have to aoply a different tactic ince and if i manage to smwade through it all. But I don't think I will get there by starting with what I think the clues mean as they are stated in the poem. If I've decided I'm looking for a noble fir, what am I forgetting at the edge of my mind that tells me why this feels like a mistake? 


No one starts by grid searching, surely. But maybe we can take some lessons from the abstract masters and make a map of sorts of where all these things converge. A curious confluence, maybe? The sweet sweet candy that gives us consequences and cavities may be a clue as to how to move the needle. Maybe embracing the rabbit hole, feeding the ""obsession""  is the way to go, even though we've been dissuaded from that in so many words? 


Yes, focus on the poem--but really focus on it. Keep talking myself through it and letting the things I've learned sort of by osmosis float up to the top, rather than forcing it. Chewing on the words, digesting them slowly, thinking about how they relate to other things, even not explicitly stated? Diving head first into the red sea, parting it to find the Gracie grail. Splitting the atom. 



Then again, maybe I'm just a robot, and this is all but a dream. Sometimes it feels that way. Maybe that's the point. I don't know yet, but I'm giving myself over to it and not trying to fight my own mind or outsmart myself or the author. Just going with the flow. Walk as a river. Not a bull in a China shop. See what rings a bell. Find the ironic and the funny and the silly and the serious, and where all the threads eventually all wind up. The tension before the present is unwrapped, when something is camouflaged, latent, mysterious, full of wonder. Someone hiding with Groucho Marx glasses and a mustache that hides how much they must ache, and tries to cover up their mistakes. Who wouldn't want to be Indiana Jones? 

And if you're looking for an Indiana Jones, where do you even find him? Haha. In movies? The web? Somewhere on the map? Or somewhere else? What ties this together? Who is the mascot with an ascot of this journey that Fred and Shaggy and Scooby-Doo (and we!) have spent their time hoping to unmask, waiting for a return on all the time we've invested? Who is the Bandit King, and why? How do we read the smoke signals and the signs, look for the torches on the mountain to lead us? It is a fun challenge, and I don't feel embarrassed to give into it whole heartedly. 


I dug a hole and keep Indiana Jonesing and trying to connect it to a treasure. Certain things rose to the top, but I haven't dug all the way through the earth to the core and hit China yet so I'm still safe for now! Haha. It's so fun to just get lost in this sometimes. Mimes and rhymes and bandanas and things to invest in for a return. A regency, a domain, a realm, a holiday, a doctor, a puppet master pulling the strings, and something to color it all vividly. What is something that means eternity, ephemeral, but solid somehow, nodes on spokes on wheels and having fun getting derailed. 


And then, for me, comes the dissection to try and figure out the real place that's playing dress up in some of the stories, and which characters have been replaced by their understudy, and which order the scene changes come. Break a leg! Play the game, read the program to follow the acts in the right order, and keep track of who is who and what is what. Find the trash and sift through it for the good stuff like a thrifty raccoon. That's how I'm spending my evening, staring out into the garden at some late blooms, with a cup of tea, looking at the clouds in my coffee, so to speak. Haha. Having so much fun. If you made it this far, thanks for your time. I always appreciate feedback.

- I took Tylenol PM semi regularly in the 3rd trimester to help with my headaches and get to sleep. Also spoke about this with my OB.
- I gained 47 lbs throughout my pregnancy and constantly got shit for my weight gain from my OB, although my tests were never concerning and I remained very healthy. I’m currently 25 lbs down just from giving birth, breastfeeding, and stroller walks with my baby. Please don’t sweat the weight gain (I guess unless there’s some medical issue.)

My husband and I will be in Ireland end of September. I want to preface this with while we know this is busy, we’re coming to Ireland to explore the scenery and mingle with locals - we love a relaxing vacation, but we will save that for another trip. This is our current (very detailed) plan:

Day 1
Land 10am, pick up car, early check into hotel, Trinity College Library/Book of Kells, Guinness Tour, end at Cobblestone

Day 2
Kilkenny Castle, St Canice Cathedral and Roundtower, Rock of Cashel (have been advised to have lunch here also), Cahir Castle (only if we have time), drive to Cork, dinner at Elbow Lane Brew and Smokehouse, Sin E for drinks/music

Day 3
English Market for coffee and snacks for the day, Blarney Castle by 930am, then onto Mizen Head Bridge/walk, Barley Cove beach stroll, Hackett’s Pub, stay in Schull

Day 4
Ring of Beara - focus on Healy Pass/optional Hungry Hill hike weather/time permitting, Dzogchen Buddhist Temple on the terrace for coffee and cake, Allihie’s Loop, Eyeries, Ardgroom Stone Circle, end at Airbnb in Tuosist. Undecided on dinner at An Sibin or go into Kenmare, will depend mostly on timing. 

Day 5
Uragh Stone Circle, Gleninchaquin Park. No other in-stone plans, keeping it open. If we have the energy for it, will do Gap of Dunloe. If not, probably chill in Tuosist and maybe go to No 35 in Kenmare for dinner and/or Roughty Bar. 
	
Day 6
Ring of Kerry - focus on Coomanaspig pass, Kerry Cliffs, Skellig Ring, Bray Head then head to Dingle. Dinner at Out of the Blue. Probably Dick Mack’s after.

Day 7
Coffee at My Boy Blue, then do Slea Head Drive. If weather is good, drive Conor Pass. Reel Dingle Fish and pubs after. 

Day 8
Hike Mount Brandon in the morning, Murphy’s Pub in Brandon afterward, then Dingle Distillery. 

Day 9
Drive to Cliffs of Moher. Most of the hiking trails are shut down so this won’t take more than 90 min. Then head back to Dublin. I know this is a long driving day. There’s no way around it.

Day 10
Bread 41 in the morning, then tattoos. No other plans, open to suggestions. Flight home next morning.

I (21F) am starting to work at a restaurant here in Sac soon, but it's about a 45 minute commute from home. This is not ideal for days where I have dinner plans in the city after an opening shift (which happens a few times a week). I'm torn between going home, showering, and driving to and from over and over, OR just roughing it and hanging out at a coffee shop and changing in my car... you get the jist. Not a fan of either option. 

I was thinking about getting a planet fitness black card membership so I can shower and change at my leisure, and even lay down in their little massage beds. I just want somewhere to /unwind/ for a bit (and not have to pay for anything like food, drinks, or parking). The problem here is it's sort of awkward to just... hang out at a family fitness for a few hours. I don't think I would super know what to do with myself, and there's not really a lounge. There's the pricey gyms that come with those lounge areas... but I can't afford them. 

I know people are going to recommend libraries, but I don't know the extent of which I could unwind at a library, and they close at 6, which could leave me stranded for a few hours after anyways. 

Any suggestions? A country club for The People I don't know about? A pay-by-the-hour room somewhere that isn't bug-infested? Let me know!

It's 4 in the morning and I feel like I'm losing my goddamn mind.

I've been having the same nightmare every night for exactly five years now. I had hoped the change of scenery might help me get my mind off of everything, but for the past couple of months it's been slowly... deteriorating. Tonight was special. Tonight it was so, so much worse.
Happy Fucking Anniversary.

The most immediate difference from the regular dream is the hardest one to describe. If the original dreams were like sitting alone in a dark, creepy movie theater, these ones had been like having a moldy View-Master fused to my skull. The scene was choppy and stilted, the images in my head looked like they had been covered in bacon grease and deep fried. Everywhere I looked seemed to writhe and twitch as if in agony, and some details kept changing on the peripherals of my vision.

The various cords and tubes almost seemed to be blossoming from the bed, constantly moving and melding together in an ever shifting latticework that seemed to encompass the cramped room. The screens displayed increasingly jumbled messes of numbers and lines, some of the smaller screens skittering around and changing size when I looked away.

Her skin constantly changed color and texture, going from leathery orange to sickly green and all the way back around to deathly pale. Her teeth crowded behind her emaciated lips, moving aggressively past each other like tourists late for their connecting flight, and the number of them kept changing. That I can no longer make out her garbled speech as she claws at an ever larger tumescent, shifting mass of flesh and hairs on her midsection is a blessing these days. This is where the dream usually ends, but tonight my torment had yet to reach its peak.

Suddenly there was a high pitched tone that threatened to split my head in two and the screens started flashing angrily. The cords shuddered and pulsed as distended lumps formed at the edges of the room and traveled down the quivering lines towards the pitiful creature in the bed. Her head slammed backwards into the headboard with a sickening crack as she convulsed in ways that shouldn't be possible for the human body. Her joints constantly shifted positions and angles, and at some points she had more or less than she should.

She sits up suddenly and reaches towards me, her emaciated arms crossing the distance impossibly fast as hordes of spiders with far too many limbs come pouring out of her mouth. Her mouth opens impossibly wide, row upon row of misshapen teeth revealing more of the same. The sounds of scuttling limbs is deafening and I don't even realize I'm awake and screaming until I have to stop to take a breath. The skittering doesn't die out with my voice.

If anything, the maddening scrabble of tiny legs seemed even louder now that I was awake.

I should have known something like this would happen today.

The rumbling, oppressively dark clouds that seemed to hang exclusively over my apartment building were a perfect mirror of my state of mind as I approached the front door. I had considered taking the day off, but the idea of explaining why to my nosy boss seemed too high a mountain to climb today. When I got home, however, I found myself blissfully alone. Ruth seemed to have gotten the message, for now, and Darla seemed to be keeping her own company. Sweet Pea was acting more entitled than usual, I actually had to bring her food bowl into the bathroom since she refused to leave, but she quietly kept to herself in the tub all night.

I stared down at the phone in my hand for a long time. I knew I had to feed myself, but the idea of talking to another person today seemed almost impossible. I relegated myself to raiding the fridge, and when I found the foil wrapped homemade blueberry pie sitting in the back I actually had the gall to think to myself, darkly, *Today must be my lucky day!*

I deserve everything that's happening to me right now.

God only knows what ingredients Ruth might have used, and that was before it had spent weeks at the back of the fridge. I have to admit it was delicious, but before I had even finished I was starting to see things.

I turned to look at a sound I was worried was Ruth unlocking my door, but something made me pause and look back towards the sink. It looked like my favorite mug was sitting precariously on the edge of the counter, the same mug whose shards I had plucked from my heel last night. I rubbed my eyes in disbelief, but when I looked again the counter was bare.

At the time, I thought I was just having a bad day. I always do on this particular day. I thought the guilt over losing the mug had been the straw that broke my back, and I had finally lost my mind. I thought about knocking on Darla's door and seeing if she wanted to wipe out the rest of the day together, hell we could even just go out to the movies. God help me, I even thought about going and talking to Ruth. Just unburdening my soul and dumping all of my woes at her feet.

Ultimately I decided none of it was worth the effort, the quicker I could sleep through the day the quicker it would be tomorrow.

The scuttling, skittering madness was so loud when I woke up I couldn't hear anything else. Clutching my hands tight to my ears to try to drown it out I stumbled towards the door to the bedroom. The moment my hand made contact with the doorknob the scratching cut out, leaving only the agitated grumbling of a looming storm. I don't even hear any of my neighbors through the paper-thin walls.

Stepping into the hallway I strained to hear anything over the sound of my own pounding heartbeat in my ears. I don't remember even turning the TV on today, yet the living room was once again awash in a cold blue glow that only made it seem lonelier, more claustrophobic. The piles of trash and sad, disheveled furniture seemed to be crowding me in, crushing me under the weight of so many nights spent circling the drain. I couldn't put my finger on it but something just seemed wrong, my home for some reason ringing false in my eyes. Unfamiliar. Unwelcoming.

My heart almost leaped straight up into my throat when my eyes locked onto the small ceramic cup sitting on the edge of the sink. It can't be the same mug that had gone down the trash chute before its time, but I don't own any others. The more I stared at it the more sure I was that it couldn't be the same. The handle on this one was a little smaller, and sat a bit too high. The text, which had fooled me on a quick glance, no longer said World's Greatest Dad. It no longer said anything, really, as the strange symbols only bore a passing resemblance to english letters. I had picked it up to get a closer look when suddenly it sprang to life in my hand.

It's hard to describe, but it kind of looked like the mug was a foil balloon that had been suddenly and violently deflated. The smooth, round ceramic slumped into hard edges and sharp points. It very briefly resembles a small, white tumbleweed before the center blossomed into innumerable thin, white needles that sank deep into the fleshy pad of my palm.

My favorite coffee cup had fucking bitten me.

I whipped my arm around reflexively, thankfully before it had gotten a good grip, and I felt a strip of skin tearing off as the little ceramic freak went sailing across the room. The sound it made when it smashed into the wall was absolutely exquisite, sending far more twitching ceramic legs than should have been possible spraying in all directions like a popped boil full of white-gloved fingers. That's when all hell broke loose, just as a flash of lightning from the kitchen window gave me my first good look at the room.

Suddenly, the apartment erupted into life, furniture and piles of trash shifting and twitching as the deafening sounds of tiny scurrying appendages swallowed me whole. The wallpaper almost seemed to be bubbling and popping, until I saw the hundreds of small insects doing a poor job of imitating moldy paint chips. Another couch, just like the one on which I had spent so many nights trying to just fade into oblivion, came crawling out from behind the coffee table, blocking the light from the TV as its cushions parted like a fat bulldog's jowls to reveal hungry rows of gnashing leather-bound teeth. A second coffee table emerged from underneath the first and lurched between me and the front door, seeming to almost grow towards me as one of it's legs split in two and the top morphed into a pentagonal shape.

Backing towards the hallway I grabbed one of the dining room chairs to defend myself, but when my fingers slip into the pattern carved in the back the holes suddenly constricted, burying rough wooden needles into my fingers from all angles. Gritting my teeth so hard I tasted blood, I hoisted the chair-thing above my head and savagely smashed it against the table, sending strangely soft chunks of twitching wood and particle board flying.

Whatever fleeting moment of hope I felt at my barbaric victory against the dining room set was swiftly dashed when the couch took its place at the entrance to the hallway. I was considering an escape through the bedroom, the window slats should open just wide enough to squeeze out, when I heard a mournful cry from behind me.

Sweet Pea was still in the bathroom.

No time to think, I immediately went charging around the corner and came to a stop so hard I could swear I slid a little on the floor. I didn't even notice at first that the bathroom door was closed. I finally saw the source of the flood of tiny insect-like things infesting my apartment. The closet door was open again. A small, unremarkable cardboard box lay across the threshold, upturned slightly as a writhing mass of old clothes that should have been donated or thrown away years ago spilled out into the hallway. The permanent marker scrawl on the side was mostly legible, and it almost spelled her name correctly.

I realize I've stepped back into the corner of the hallway when I hear the couch redouble it's efforts to reach me. Turning my head to look I see it stuffing itself into the hallway, bulging and morphing as it slowly oozes down the hallway. I find myself frozen staring at it as hundreds of tiny, square couch legs sprout from its sides and dig deep into the plaster of the walls. The frantic scraping of the couch's thick wooden legs is deeper than the low buzz of scrabbling legs from before, more urgent and powerful, as it desperately dragged itself towards me.

I definitely won't be getting out through the bedroom.

Sweet Pea let out another small, muffled cry and I don't even realize I'm moving until I feel the impact of the box against my foot and the cool metal of the knob mixed with a burning itch in my palm as I slam the closet door shut. The pile of clothes crushed under the door squealed in a chorus of pain and rippled as dozens of fabric fingers shot out, tapping frantically on the floor like a piano concerto.

Dazed, I looked down at my hand to see a large wooden splinter with three joints sprouting from my palm, twitching and writhing like a severed roach leg or lizard tail. Without stopping to think about it I ripped it out with my teeth and spat the wriggling hunk of wood to the floor, wrenching my foot away from the gradually slowing fabric appendages as I closed the distance to the bathroom. The moment I opened the bathroom door Sweet Pea bolted between my legs and through the closet door that had reopened behind me when I wasn't looking. Before I could even think of giving chase the bulky, misshapen form of the couch came lumbering around the corner and I swiftly locked myself in the bathroom.

That's where I've been for the past half an hour or so while the thunderous pounding of rain intensifies against the window, typing this up with bloody toilet paper wrapped around my arm while a couch tries to fit through a quarter-inch thick gap between the door and the floor. The worst part is, it's starting to get somewhere. The old lady who lives next door might have drugged me, and that was the best case scenario. A part of me is sure this is just a bad dream, a terrible reaction to the wrong kind of ""special"" dessert from an out of touch old bat who probably meant well. A bigger part of me wants to accept it, to just sit here and wait while my sad, empty apartment gets sadder and emptier, to let the couch swallow me whole. Something stronger rising from the deepest depths of my soul can still hear Sweet Pea calling from down the hall, and thinks the heavy porcelain toilet tank lid could probably do a lot more damage than a wooden chair. Ruth's going to be pissed, she just installed it last week.

If I don't make it... shit, I don't know. I have nothing to give and nobody to give it to. Just take my advice. Go wash your damn dishes. Go hug your loved ones. Go tell her you're sorry.

We have been planning to have family over once we are settled, but aren’t sure how we should handle inviting his dad’s wife/her kids.

For context, my partner and I just met her less than a year ago. Our communication with her has been extremely minimal considering she only speaks Spanish and we can’t communicate very well in Spanish (we’re slowly learning but it’s not good enough to really hold any type of conversation). Anyways, it’s not really the fact that we don’t know her as much as it is the fact that we find her to be a bit disrespectful.

For example, on multiple occasions, she would not acknowledge me, but would acknowledge my partner (saying hi/bye to him, but not me, offering him a plate of food during gatherings but completely avoiding me) The first time she somewhat acknowledged me was to ask me if I was interested in purchasing anything from this website (makeup, coffee, etc). She was having my partners grandma relay this to me, and even had her send me the link. It was basically one of those storefront links. I buy, and she gets commission off of it. I’m all for a girl getting in her bag, but this just seemed sooo distasteful because it just felt like she saw me as someone that she could potentially get money from??

Prior to this, she had my partners dad text him a picture of something she made to ask if I liked it, and said it was $30 if I was interested.

However, the first, and biggest indicator that she had no shame/care, was BEFORE we had even met her. My partner was living across the country, and was planning to move back to our very expensive state. His dad was living in a studio w his wife/her kids, so my partner decided to ask if he would be interested in renting out a house since we could combine income and it would benefit all of us.

His dad told us that she could only pay $600 for rent. My partner and I found multiple houses that could fit us all, with all of us being able to pay the same amount ($600), however each one of these houses, she had a problem with (too close to the Main Street, didn’t like the layout, location was “too ghetto”). Her choices? Houses that would require everyone else to pay around $800-$1000 while she would only stick to paying $600. We didn’t end up moving in with them thankfully, but considering this was our first introduction to her, and then everything else up to this point has just made it extremely hard to like her.

It’s our space, and I know we decide who is welcome, but neither my partner and I want to come off rude. My partner is worried that his grandparents will be upset if we intentionally disinvite her, as we are planning to have them over for dinner as well.

AITAH for not wanting her in our home? Is this one of those things you just kinda accept, and play nice to keep the peace??",13,1757384642.0,AmItheAsshole,11,0.81,False
1nc74qw,https://imageditingai.com/,I Built an AI Tool to Finally Make Editing Text in Images Easy! (No More Text-on-Image Headaches!),"If you've ever tried to generate an image with text using current AI models, or even just edit text on an existing photo, you know the pain. Typos, weird fonts, text in all the wrong places, impossible to align... it's a nightmare. I got so fed up with these limitations that I decided to build a solution.

[https://imageditingai.com/](https://imageditingai.com/)

  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_HPfzCz7Q00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HPfzCz7Q00)  


**So, what does it do?**

My tool uses a conversational interface to give you incredible precision over both your images and any text you want to put on them. Think of it like having a super-powered graphic designer you can just chat with.

Here's how it generally works:

1. **Start with an Image (Yours or Mine):** You can either upload an image you already have, or you can generate a brand new one using a detailed text prompt. Want a ""dark, moody background with a coffee mug and steam""? Just ask, and it'll create it.
2. **Edit Images with Simple Commands:** This is where the conversational magic truly begins. Want to ""move that coffee mug to the bottom right""? Done. Need to ""remove that watermark from the corner""? Poof, it's gone. No more fiddling with selection tools or cloning – just tell the AI what you want.
3. **Add Text with Unprecedented Control:** This is the game-changer.
   * **Draw a Box:** You physically draw a rectangle on the image where you want your text to appear. This tells the AI exactly where to focus.
   * **Speak Your Text & Style:** Then, you simply tell the AI what words to put there, and how you want them to look. ""Add the words 'Daily Grind Cafe' in a bold, white, sans-serif font, centered in that box."" The AI understands and places the text perfectly.
   * **Refine Iteratively:** Want to change the font to Times New Roman? Or make the main headline yellow and the prices green? You just keep chatting with it, and the AI makes the adjustments in real-time. It handles complex layouts too, like creating a neatly formatted menu or a list, just from your conversational input.
4. **Download Your Masterpiece:** Once everything looks perfect, you can download your image in high quality (PNG, PDF, etc.) ready for whatever you need it for.

Was gifted this nice journal by a rather strange gentleman I met on my way out of town. He shared his fire and a fresh pot of coffee with me and aside from basic pleasantries, all he told me was he was over in this part of the country for the spring. A man of few words, I guess, and I reckon since we share that in common neither of us were too bothered by the lack of conversation. It was nice to have the company, odd as he was, at least in this bit of country he was. Looked like he just stepped off a train from New York, or Chicago, or one of them places. 

He may have.

When the sun was a bit higher in the sky he broke the long silence - it was time for him to move on - to only him and God knows where. Aside from the old livestock town full of drunkards and lowlifes I'd just ridden out of, there was nothing but harsh, wild country for weeks. 

I helped pack his wagon and in return got this journal, then watched the man slowly shrink into the brightening horizon, though I thought I saw him turn and tip his hat one last time before disappearing.

Something about him felt familiar yet I cannot quite put my finger on what.

It's been a couple weeks since I met that strange man and still he lingers in the back of my mind. Plain idiot or just naive, more likely a combination of the two, he was certainly out of place with his fancy clothes and wagon and I often find myself worrying that he's only gone and gotten himself lost or killed in this harsh land. But some small part of me gets the feeling that he is more than fine, and that is enough to keep me from up and risking my own life trying to track down the fool. 

I haven't wandered too far from the old livestock town since leaving that day, moving my camp around when and wherever I pleased. Always far enough from the drunken scuttle of life there but close enough to stop in for supplies or odd end jobs to make what little money I need. So far, life has been nice and comfortable here.

Except for the sky.

Back in Wyoming where I spent the majority of my life I saw all manner of weather, all that Mother Nature had to offer, so I thought. But the skies here - some stretch of wild between Cheyenne and Oklahoma - they are bigger, almost towering over you in a way that makes men feel small. Like an old force too great for understanding. 

At first I was in love with this heavy, imposing blanket of blue and stars that the mountains back home would in parts obscure. Now I find myself longing for those great mountains, those old, earthly protectors of Cheyenne. 

In the plains, nothing can protect you from the fingers of God.

The Shawnee and Caddo tell legend of the Cyclone Person - some sort of being with long, thrashing hair that twists and devours what land it touches. I've only ever heard tell of 'cyclones' since coming down to these parts, and from what little the locals feel like sharing, it sure ain't nothing good. 

If it weren't for my own eyes, I'd say they were all full of horseshit.

1nc72eb,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1nc72eb/esophagitis_vomiting/,Esophagitis & Vomiting,"28 M diagnosed with esophagitis a few years ago. Been on omeprazole 40 for the past 3 years (only helps a bit) 

I’ve had this issue since I was a boy but if I overeat or eat specific foods such as bananas, yogurt, ice cream, etc I feel it getting stuck in my esophagus and it’s the most uncomfortable feeling. I started inducing vomiting at a young age & grew up thinking it was normal. It got worse in high school & I was vomiting almost every day. I don’t vomit every meal it’s mainly when I overeat. 

I still induce vomit about 5x a week. Not sure if it’s an esophagus or stomach issue. Food feels stuck, bloated, burning sensation, feels like food is being pressed or pushing stomach / esophagus. The pain and discomfort goes away right after vomiting. 

The only meal I don’t vomit is breakfast & it’s because breakfast is light. Two waffles, an egg, & water. I used to drink coffee but it caused burning and cramping. 

Dinner is mixed throughout the week but mainly baked fish with rice. Some days curry. I also eat a lot of fried foods which I know I should probably stop. 

I’ve visited multiple GI docs and they all do the same things; endoscopy & omeprazole. My last recent endoscopy came back normal. The esophagus was inflamed from the vomiting, but normal. The last treatment i received was dupixent and an oral medication that’s supposed to coat my esophagus. The doc thinks I have food allergy. I stopped the dupixent since I was having allergic reactions (mostly boils on body & itching), those all went away once I stopped dupixent.

Does anyone else have this issue? I still continue to vomit & sooth my stomach with waffles or bread. Not sure why that helps but it does. Not sure how I can fix this issue.

I put my coffee in the freezer to preserve its freshness, but whenever I make a shot of espresso, the crema is very thin when compared to the caffeinated espresso that I've made in other machines, and especially compared to the crema that I see in Youtube videos. Is this a decaf thing, a freezer thing, is my technique bad, or is my machine just not very good? I use the Ninja Luxe 601, and the machine I make regular espresso from is the Breville Bambino (not mine) for context.",1,1757384426.0,espresso,1,1.0,False
1nc71a9,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1nc71a9/i_accidentally_became_the_office_tech_guy_because/,"I accidentally became the office ""tech guy"" because I googled one thing six months ago","# This is so stupid, but I need to get it off my chest.

Back in April, our printer started making a horrible grinding noise and displaying an error code. Everyone's freaking out, calling IT, and IT's like ""yeah, we'll be there sometime this week,"" which obviously means never.

I literally just googled the error code on my phone while everyone else stood around panicking. Took maybe 30 seconds. Turns out you just had to adjust this one paper tray thing. Fixed.

Now somehow, I'm the unofficial IT support for literally everything. ""Hey, can you look at my computer?"" ""My email's being weird."" ""The coffee machine is blinking - you're good with technology, right?""

Here's the thing - I know absolutely nothing about technology. I'm in MARKETING. I write Instagram captions and plan events. But apparently being the only person here under 40 who's willing to try turning something off and on again makes me some kind of wizard.

The worst part? Last week, our actual IT guy showed up to fix something and asked me how I solved all these tech issues so fast. I wanted to be like ""dude, I just Google everything,"" but instead I said some nonsense about ""systematic troubleshooting,"" and he nodded like I was a genius.

Now management's noticed. They're talking about adding ""IT responsibilities"" to my job description in my next review. I coordinate marketing campaigns! I don't know what a server is! But apparently I'm about to become responsible for keeping our entire digital infrastructure running.

I keep meaning to tell everyone I'm just googling stuff, but... everyone's so grateful when I fix things. And honestly, it's kinda nice being the person who solves problems instead of the person who creates them (looking at you, quarterly budget presentations).

I'm just dreading the day someone asks me to do something that can't be solved with ""Did you try unplugging it for 10 seconds?""",13,1757384357.0,confessions,7,1.0,False
1nc70q5,https://i.redd.it/8kqn8xitt1of1.jpeg,Humacology Yellow CBD oil,"First time using a CBD only oil during the day and I have found this to be excellent for treating anxiety and ADHD, usually I don't have higher CBD than THC during day time but have found this to be the best oil so far for my conditions, it also feels a little energising almost and helps with focus. Highly recommend this oil the only problem I really have with this is with previous balanced oils I would use in my bullet coffee in the mornings however the flavour in this oil almost tastes like it's from a essential oil diffuser definitely very strong flavour which I'm assuming is because of the added terps?
