My body gradually weakens.

Today, my wolf is completely gone, and I have three days left to live.

On the last day before I draw my final breath, I agree to donate my kidney to my sister. Thrilled, my mate swears that he'll make it up to me someday.

My sister is being swamped with insults on the college forum after she was caught plagiarizing my Belladonna thesis.

But I come forward and claim that I'm the one who plagiarized it.

Mom and Dad are pleased, saying I've finally become mature.

At last, I've become the perfect mate and daughter in their eyes.

But why are they crying after my body has turned cold and lifeless?

Chapter 1

When I found out I was going to die, I accepted it with ease.

My mate, Simon Knightley, came to me with a sullen expression and said, ""Zora, Laila has been in poor health since birth. She's an Omega with the weakest healing ability.

""One of her kidneys is failing, and she needs a transplant to survive.""

He pulled out a Mate Bond Breaking Agreement to dissolve our mate bond. After hesitating for a long while, he gritted his teeth and said, ""Your kidney is the best match for Laila. But if you refuse to donate your kidney, you'll have to sign this agreement to break our mate bond.

""Laila doesn't have much time left… And she wants to experience the marking ceremony before she dies. After talking to your parents, they agreed that I should be the one to do it.

""I love you, Zora. We're only doing this to make sure Laila doesn't die with regrets.

""Once she's gone, we'll get back together. Okay?""

I stared at the agreement in Simon's hands. Ever since Laila Thorne's kidney failure, everyone in my family had been expecting me to donate my kidney to her.

But what they didn't know was—I only had one kidney left.

When they found out I refused to donate, they were utterly disappointed. They kept saying how ungrateful I was.

""Zora, your sister's dying. All she needs is your kidney to survive. How can you just stand by and watch her die?""

My parents wouldn't listen to my explanation. Instead, they kicked me out.

""An ingrate like you doesn't deserve to be part of this family. If you won't save Laila, then get out!""

And now, even my mate was forcing me to either donate the kidney or he'd mark Laila instead.

But I was dying anyway. At this point, what difference would it make?

""I agree,"" I said airily.

Stunned, Simon jerked his head up. ""Really? That's amazing! Laila has a chance now!""

He tore the agreement and hurried me to the healing hut.

Mom and Dad also received the news. They arrived soon after, and Mom threw her arms around Laila and wept. ""Laila, you have a chance now! You'll be able to stay with me forever…""

Afraid that I'd change my mind, Dad quickly had the healer bring over the surgical consent form.

Once I signed it, my parents finally relaxed.

""Zora, you've finally matured,"" Dad said. ""You're starting to care for your sister. Don't blame us for being biased, okay? Laila's been through so much—she needs our love.

""But we won't mistreat you either. You'll still get your part of the inheritance.""

I shook my head, swallowing the bitterness in my chest. ""Just give it all to Laila. I won't need it anyway.""

Momentarily stunned, Mom patted me and chided, ""What nonsense are you talking about? Of course, you'll need it!

""Even if your mate is the top warrior in the Lunaris pack and can give you a comfortable life, you can't just disregard your family inheritance.""

Slowly, I slipped into a daze.

Ever since I failed to show up for Dad's kidney transplant surgery five years ago and Laila donated hers instead, my family hadn't been this kind to me.

And it was precisely because she had saved Dad that my parents insisted I owed her and that I had to treat her even better.

From then on, Laila got the best of everything.

She also started targeting me by falsely accusing me, making Mom and Dad resent me even more. Eventually, no matter what I did, it was always wrong.

I used to defend myself. Now, I just stayed quiet.

Then Mom rushed to Laila's side, and Dad and Simon followed close behind.

They all surrounded her, and it was the perfect picture of a loving family.

Only I stood alone in the corner, like an outsider who didn't belong.

Chapter 2

My eyes stung.

Rubbing my eyes roughly, I turned to leave, but Simon stopped me at the door.

""Laila has to stay at the healing hut for treatment, and she won't be able to finish her Werewolf Academy thesis,"" he said. ""Aren't you working on the Belladonna Cure thesis? It's exactly the same as Laila's. Why not let her refer to yours?""

A pang of bitterness hit me. I knew there was more to his words.

Laila's health had always been fragile, so I had always done her Werewolf Academy homework for her. She had even asked me to cheat for her in exams.

She didn't want my grades to surpass hers, yet through plagiarizing my work, she became the top student in the Werewolf Academy.

In truth, she hadn't even started her thesis yet. She was just waiting to copy mine.

Noticing my silence, Mom spoke in a low voice. ""You know how bright Laila is. It's just her health… You're her sister. Help her out, okay?""

I had heard this over and over again for the past five years, and I should've been used to it by now. But every time those words echoed in my ears, my chest tightened.

I forced a smile and nodded. ""Alright. I'll go get it now.""

This was the last time. I wondered if Laila could still graduate smoothly without someone to plagiarize from after I was gone.

""I knew you'd say yes!"" Simon exclaimed. ""So when I left home, I brought your thesis with me.""

He quickly pulled it from his bag and handed it to Laila.

Laila stuck her tongue out at me, a smug smile on her face.

Gently stroking her hair, Simon bent down and whispered something in her ear. She flushed and shot him a glare.

I said nothing and watched their intimate interaction.

If my wolf hadn't been killed by wolfsbane, it would've been howling with rage inside me.

I turned and left the healing hut. Laughter echoed behind me, but no one stopped me this time. Perhaps they hadn't even noticed I had left.

I went back home. As I gazed at the cozy interior, I suddenly made up my mind.

I wanted to clear all my belongings. Since no one seemed to care about me at all, I'd just discard everything about myself. After all, I didn't want my things to be a burden.

I packed everything—including my clothes, daily necessities, my pictures, the gifts I'd bought for my family and Simon—and threw them in the trash outside.

I was completely exhausted, and my breathing grew labored. The wolfsbane had taken hold of my body, and with every movement, a wave of excruciating pain shot through me.

I was really dying.

It took hours before I regained some strength. Just as I got into bed and was about to sleep, Simon barged in.

Flanking a crying Laila, Mom and Dad hurried after him.

""Zora, you promised to give Laila your thesis. How could you collude with others and accuse your sister of plagiarism?"" Simon questioned, his eyes thick with disappointment.

""Zora, I understand that you're upset about me borrowing your thesis."" Laila sobbed. ""But how could you ask your supervisor to publicly criticize me online? I've been swarmed with insults! You're so cruel!""

""Zora, we're family. How could you do this to your sister?"" Mom chimed in disapprovingly.

Turning back to Laila, Mom patted her back gently and cooed, ""Don't cry, sweetheart. You'll hurt yourself. I'll make your sister apologize to you!""

Chapter 3

So it turned out after getting my thesis, Laila flaunted it on the academy's forum.

Unfortunately, my supervisor saw the post.

He had always held high expectations for me, even offering to help revise my thesis before. So the moment Laila uploaded it online, he sensed something was off.

He questioned her about the details, but she couldn't answer a single thing.

The people online immediately realized something was wrong.

How could someone fail to answer questions about their own thesis?

Accusations of plagiarism came flooding in.

""Laila's been so devastated that she fainted from crying several times,"" Simon boomed. ""Zora, you're her sister. How could you do this to her? Apologize to her now!""

Ignoring how pale I looked, he dragged me out of bed and shoved me in front of Laila.

My thoughts wandered. Why had he grown so close to her?

Five years ago, after my family disowned me, I had trudged through a downpour, drenched to the bone.

Then Simon appeared.

The moment I saw him, my wounded wolf stirred with hope. I could feel that he was my predestined mate.

He brought me home, gave me clean clothes, a steaming cup of coffee, and sat beside me as I poured out my heartbreak.

He pitied me, swearing he'd treat me well for the rest of my life.

Back then, he had loathed Laila. He never met her, but he despised anyone who hurt me.

But when had things started to change?

Was it when Laila began hovering around him, acting sweet like a lover? Was it when she clung to him during our dates, or when they started texting each other over the phone for long hours?

My lover had become the knight of the person I resented most.

I thought I could handle the pain, but it still hurt.

Now that I was dying, I could've just let them have whatever they wanted.

""It's my fault for putting you in this mess. I'll clear your name by telling them that I was the one who plagiarized your work,"" I said.

The moment I apologized, they were stunned. They hadn't expected me to be this obedient.

""You've really started to care for your sister,"" Mom said, her gaze turning complicated. ""I'm glad that you two are finally looking out for each other.""

""Zora, you've finally matured,"" Dad chimed in. ""If you keep this up, your mom and I will surely dote on you!""

Guilt flickered in Simon's eyes.

""You're my mate, so I'll surely take care of you,"" he said, trying to comfort me. ""Even if you can't continue your studies at the Werewolf Academy, you can still live comfortably.""

I tried to smile through the pallor.

However, the future Simon spoke of didn't exist for me anymore. At this point, their love and affection were luxuries I could no longer afford.

Laila turned on the camera and began recording.

""This thesis was written by me at home…"" she sobbed. ""I never thought my sister would claim it as her own.""

As she spoke, she turned the camera toward me.

Dad, Mom, and Simon all watched closely, as if afraid I might slip.

Forcing a smile, I said, ""Laila's right. I plagiarized her work and told my supervisor it was mine. I'm sorry.""

Everyone exhaled in relief.

Laila quickly uploaded the video to the academy's forum. Soon, waves of criticism and insults crashed down on me.

Pretending to be noble, she stepped in at the perfect time to defend me. ""Guys, stop it. No matter what, she's my sister. I've already forgiven her.""

While no one else was looking, she turned to me with a cold, victorious glare and hissed, ""You have no right to compete with me. Mom, Dad, and even Simon are all mine. You don't deserve to be loved by any of them.""

Chapter 4

Laila and I were twins, but ever since we were kids, she'd always resented me.

She hated sharing her things with me. So she stole our parents' attention, my toys, my dresses—even though she had the exact same ones.

She wanted anything I laid my eyes on.

Back then, Mom and Dad treated us equally. I had everything Laila had, and they often lectured her for taking my things.

But since what had happened five years ago, they poured all their heart and soul into Laila. They thought I was selfish for not visiting Dad when he was hospitalized.

So whenever we got into an argument after that, they always took Laila's side.

""How could you bully your sister?"" was what they often told me.

After feuding with her for so many years, I was indeed the one who lost. I could no longer be at odds with her anymore.

""Yeah, you won,"" I said softly.

The kidney transplant surgery would take place in two hours, and I was about to die.

Given how deep the wolfsbane was already in my system, my soul would also be shattered by the time the Dragonbone scalpel sliced open my body.

What would be left was only my lifeless body.

By then, would Mom, Dad, and Simon weep for me?

Perhaps not. For an eyesore like me to leave, they'd probably be overjoyed. After all, Laila was the apple of their eye.

Before surgery, Mom, Dad, and Simon huddled around Laila, comforting and encouraging her.

""Laila, don't be scared. We'll be waiting for you outside,"" Dad said in a tone so gentle that I'd never heard before. ""The surgery will definitely be successful. You'll become healthy in no time.""

""After your recovery, I'll make you your favorite dishes,"" Mom chimed in lovingly.

Simon suddenly pulled out a dazzling moonstone necklace. ""I bought the necklace you fancied at the auction last time. After the surgery, I'll put it on for you!""

They were all so focused on Laila that none of them remembered that I was also about to undergo surgery.

I thought I was used to being neglected. But as I neared the end of my life, the sight before me still broke my heart.

I couldn't help but blurt my thoughts, ""Would you be sad if I died during surgery?""

Mom and Dad were stunned. As if they only recalled my existence now, diffidence flickered across their faces.

But once Mom heard what I said, she snapped, ""What nonsense are you talking about? It's just a simple kidney transplant surgery. Stop jinxing yourself!""

Dad also shot me a disapproving glance. ""Don't say that! How could you curse yourself like that? Get sufficient rest after the surgery, and you'll recover in no time. After all, you're much stronger than Laila.""

""I'll cook you a seafood feast after the surgery's over. You love seafood, don't you?""

Gazing at me affectionately, Simon held my hand and said, ""Don't worry. I hired the best healer to perform the surgery. You'll definitely be fine. Once it's over, I'll buy whatever you want for you.""

Bile rose in my throat. He bought Laila's favorite necklace in advance, yet when it came to me, he'd only make such empty promises.

I bet he'd be delighted after I was gone. He could finally be with Laila.

My gaze lingered on Mom, Dad, and Simon before I entered the operating room.

When the Dragonbone scalpel sliced open my skin, the last shred of healing ability I had was completely destroyed. The wolfsbane gnawed at my bones and tore my soul apart.

I stopped breathing entirely as I reached the end of my life.

The moment before I took my final breath, I wondered if Dad would weep for me if he found out I was the one who donated my kidney to him five years ago, and it was Laila who took the credit. Would he feel bad for me, who was always on the receiving end of Laila's slandering and bullying?

Would Mom and Dad ever regret looking down on me?

It didn't matter. Even if they would, I wouldn't be around to see it.

If there were a next life, I never ever wanted to meet them again.",1,1754813768.0,BooksPoint,0,1.0,False

1mmd1gc,https://www.reddit.com/r/BooksPoint/comments/1mmd1gc/his_regret_my_throne/,"His Regret, My Throne","Right before our Mating Ceremony, my mate, Alpha Damien, told me he had to temporarily mark an Omega from our pack, Seraphina.

He claimed she had the Moon Sickness and would die if he didn't mark her.

I fought him on it, but the next day, he moved Seraphina right into the penthouse of the Pack House.

The suite meant for the future Luna.

My suite.

To calm me, he even got on his knees, his eyes red as he promised, ""Once she's safe, I'll remove the mark. You'll still be my only Luna.""

But then, Seraphina found me, a medical report in her hand.

Six weeks pregnant.

They'd already held their marking ceremony long before Damien ever came to me.

My heart shattered into ash.

My pen dug into the calendar, carving a vicious X over the date that was supposed to be our Mating Ceremony.

Then, I opened my laptop and replied to the email from the European Laurel Healers' Guild.

""I accept your invitation. I leave on the day of the Mating Ceremony.""

Chapter 1

Right before our Mating Ceremony, my mate, Damien, said he needed to mark another she-wolf, Omega Seraphina—the one who’d supposedly saved his life.

""I have to give Seraphina a temporary mark. She's dying, Isla. The Moon Sickness is eating her alive.""

Damien’s gaze was heavy on me.

I stopped mixing the moon petal elixir in my hands.

It was for our Mating Ceremony, said to make the mate bond even stronger.

And now, he wanted me to accept him marking another woman.

My fingertips started to tremble.

""Are you fucking kidding me?""

""It's the only way to save her."" Damien turned away, unable to meet my eyes.

Those deep blue eyes I once loved were now a storm of conflict and chilling resolve.

""I owe her my life.""

""I don't care what you owe her!"" My voice went sharp. ""A mark is sacred, Damien! It's supposed to be for us—""

""One month,"" he cut me off, his eyes bloodshot, a flicker of confusion in them as if he genuinely couldn't understand my resistance.

""I promise, I'll remove the mark right after the ceremony. She'll live, and you'll still be my only Luna.""

I stared at him, my jaw tight. ""I don't agree. Unless you want to cut our mate bond.""

Damien's eyes finally turned to ice. ""This isn't a request, Isla. A life is at stake. Don't make me force this.""

He promised, ""It’s just a temporary mark. It won’t affect our bond. In a month, everything will be back to normal.""

Then he stormed out, slamming the door.

His Alpha scent, thick with anger, clung to the air long after he was gone.

The next day, I was standing at the entrance to the Pack Headquarters when a long, black sedan pulled up.

My whole body went numb.

Damien got out of the passenger seat and gently helped a delicate, fragile figure out of the car.

Seraphina.

She looked so pale, like a strong gust of wind could knock her over.

Damien's arm was wrapped around her waist, a protective gesture that sent a wave of nausea through me.

""Watch the steps,"" he said, his voice so gentle it made me want to scream.

It was a tone he had never once used with me.

I watched them walk into the building and get on the elevator.

Headed straight for the top floor.

For the luxury suite reserved only for the future Luna.

My suite.

Three hours later, Damien came back to our apartment.

I was waiting for him on the sofa, a cup of cold tea clutched in my hand.

""Is she settled in?"" My voice was so calm it scared me.

Damien took off his jacket. ""The pack healer said she needs a quiet environment.""

""So you put her on the top floor.""

""It has the best facilities,"" he said, avoiding my eyes. ""It's just temporary.""

I stood up and slowly walked toward him.

""Damien, where were you last night?""

He froze for a second. ""Dealing with a border dispute. I told you.""

""All night?""

""It was more complicated than I expected.""

I stepped closer, close enough to smell the scent of another she-wolf on him.

The commingled scent was a poisoned needle, stabbing straight through our mate bond.

A sharp, tearing pain ripped through my soul, and I almost buckled.

It wasn't just Seraphina’s scent. It was deeper, more intimate.

The kind of deeply blended scent that only comes from a true Mating mark.

He had lied.

He wasn't dealing with a border dispute last night.

He was performing their marking ceremony.

And now, he was still trying to get my permission for something that was already done.

""Do you even still need my permission?"" I took a step back, fighting the tears welling in my eyes.

""You have to understand, Isla. A life is at stake."" Damien moved toward me, trying to take my hand.

""You're my fated mate,"" he insisted, as if that explained everything. ""You should be on my side.""

I yanked my hand away. ""I need more time.""

""There is no time. She won't last much longer.""

Just then, the elevator to the penthouse opened.

Seraphina stepped out, draped in a white silk robe I'd never seen before.

Her cheeks were flushed with a sickly pink, but her eyes were bright.

She walked straight to Damien and leaned against his chest.

""Thank you, Damien,"" she said, her voice weak but sweet, her eyes fixed directly on me.

""I feel so much better already.""

Chapter2

I didn't sleep all night.

After Seraphina retreated to the penthouse, Damien followed her up.

""She needs someone to look after her,"" was the only explanation he gave.

I sat in our empty apartment, the memory of that mark—its scent—replaying over and over in my mind.

The tear in our bond throbbed, a constant, agonizing reminder.

Then it hit me.

Three weeks ago.

That night.

Damien had said he was going to handle a border dispute and didn't come back until the next morning.

That night, I lay in bed, fighting back waves of searing pain that tore through our bond.

I thought something was wrong with me, or that Damien had been hurt in the conflict.

I only breathed a sigh of relief when he finally returned.

His clothes had the faint scent of laurel leaves on them.

The sacred incense burned only during a Mating Rite.

I'd even asked him, ""Did you go to the Sacred Grove?""

He'd said, ""Just passing by.""

It never even crossed my mind that he would betray me. Betray our fate.

Now I understood.

He had already marked Seraphina that night.

And I, like a fool, had been sitting here worrying about his safety.

At dawn, my phone buzzed.

An encrypted email.

From: The Laurel Healers' Guild.

""Dear Miss Isla, we formally invite you to participate in our research initiative on Ancient Life Energies. This is the highest honor for a healer and the perfect place for your talents. Should you be interested, we hope for a response within the week.""

I stared at the screen.

This was the opportunity I had dreamed of my entire life.

It was also my only way out.

Damien walked in just as I was packing my things.

""What are you doing?""

""Packing my herbs,"" I said without looking up. ""Since the penthouse has a new occupant, I don't want to be in the way.""

""Isla, listen to me—""

""There's nothing to say."" I stood up and looked him dead in the eye. ""The Mating Ceremony,"" I stated, my voice dangerously calm, ""is off.""

The color drained from Damien's face.

""You can't do that.""

""I can,"" I said, turning back to my packing. ""I refuse to mate with an Alpha who has already marked someone else.""

""I told you, it's temporary!"" he yelled, grabbing my arm. ""I'll remove the mark in a month!""

""And then what?"" I shook him off. ""You think I'll ever trust you again?""

Pain flashed in Damien's eyes. ""She's dying, Isla. I can't just stand by and watch her die.""

""Why?"" I demanded. ""Because you owe her? Owe her for what?""

Damien fell silent, his lips pressed into a thin line.

""If you won't tell me, then we have nothing to talk about."" I walked toward the door.

""Wait!"" Damien scrambled after me, his powerful frame dropping to one knee before me. ""I promise you, in one month, I will give you the grandest ceremony this continent has ever seen. Every pack in North America will be there to witness it.""

I looked down at him, kneeling.

It wasn't pity I felt, but a bitter sense of absurdity and injustice.

Were our five years together, our fated bond, really going to end over a lie?

Was I really going to give up this easily?

In that moment of hesitation, the elevator doors opened.

Seraphina stepped out.

Seeing Damien on his knees, a fleeting, triumphant smirk touched her lips.

She walked right up to me and deliberately handed me a file folder.

""Isla,"" she said, her voice soft. ""I know you're a healer, too. This is my medical report. Could you take a look? Damien's Alpha energy is so powerful. I've been recovering so well since the marking, but... there's been an unexpected side effect. I'm a little scared.""

I took the report, my eyes scanning the data.

As a top-tier healer, I spotted the discrepancy immediately.

Six weeks pregnant.

But Damien had only completed the marking less than three weeks ago.

The dates didn't add up.

I looked up, my gaze cold, and handed the report to Damien.

""Congratulations,"" I said, my voice dripping with ice. ""It seems this 'side effect' began long before the 'temporary mark'.""

Then, without a second glance at his shocked and questioning face, I walked back into my room.

I looked at the calendar, at the bright red circle around our Mating Ceremony date.

It was now my departure date.

The countdown: thirteen days.

I opened my laptop and clicked reply.

""I accept your invitation. ""

Chapter3

That night, Damien didn't come back to our apartment.

I knew where he was.

The next morning, I opened the pack's secure network.

The top post was a new update.

Alpha Damien had ordered a hundred thousand dollars' worth of rare supplements for Seraphina.

Blood Ginseng, Moonlight Fungus, and Starfruit—things only needed during a werewolf pregnancy.

The comments section exploded.

""Is our Alpha going to be a father?""

""But isn't Isla his Luna?""

""I heard that Seraphina girl moved into the penthouse.""

""Isn't the Mating Ceremony next week?""

I shut my phone off.

At noon, I met my best friend, Chloe.

""You what?"" Chloe's voice was so sharp it nearly shattered her coffee cup. ""You're calling off the ceremony?""

""That's right.""

""Are you insane? He's your fated mate!""

""Fated mates don't mark other women right before their ceremony,"" I said, calmly sipping my coffee. ""And they certainly don't get another she-wolf pregnant with their pup.""

Chloe gasped. ""A pup?""

I showed her the photo of the lab report on my phone.

""That scheming bitch!"" Chloe slammed her hand on the table. ""She played you!""

""Probably,"" I shrugged. ""But it doesn't matter anymore.""

""Isla, you can't just give up. Damien loves you.""

""Loves me?"" I gave a bitter laugh. ""Does someone who loves you mark another woman behind your back?""

Chloe fell silent.

""I've already accepted the invitation from the European Healers' Guild,"" I said, standing up. ""I'm leaving tomorrow.""

""So soon?""

""If I stay any longer, I'm afraid I'll do something I regret.""

At eleven that night, I got back to the apartment building after an herb exchange.

The gathering was a success.

I’d met several healers from Europe, including a few Alphas I’d never seen before.

When the elevator doors opened, Damien was standing there.

His eyes were cold, his nostrils flaring slightly. ""Where were you?""

""An herb exchange.""

""With who?"" he pressed.

""Some colleagues.""

Damien stalked towards me, like a predator closing in on its prey. ""Don't lie to me. I smell another male's scent on you. An Alpha's.""

""So what if you do?""

A dangerous light flashed in his eyes. ""Get away from me, and wash that scent off you.""

""You don't get to order me around.""

""I'm your fated mate!""

""No, you're not,"" I said, pushing past him. ""You're Seraphina's.""

I walked towards our apartment, Damien following close behind.

But instead of arguing, he went straight to the armchair by the fireplace, sat down, and closed his eyes.

I knew what he was doing.

The mind-link.

His expression softened, and I could feel the murmur of his thoughts through our strained bond.

The pup is going to be so strong, so healthy.

The pup.

He was already looking forward to it.

I turned to go to my room.

""Isla.""

His voice stopped me.

""There's something about the ceremony I need to talk to you about.""

Chapter4

I stopped and turned, my face a cold mask. ""What is it now?""

""It's about the Rite of the Moon Spring."" He opened his eyes, and those deep blue pools held an undeniable command. ""I need to postpone it.""

""Why."" It wasn't a question.

""Seraphina's pregnancy is unstable. The healer said the pure energy of the Moon Spring would be good for her. So...""

He paused, as if searching for the right words. ""I've decided it's better if she has it.""

Let her have it.

He said it so casually, as if he were just rescheduling a meeting.

That was the highest honor for a Luna, to receive the pack's blessing.

It was the sacred moment we had dreamed of together.

My heart was numb.

I couldn't even feel the pain anymore.

I answered in the calmest voice I could manage. ""Fine.""

My calmness seemed to unnerve him. ""You... don't have anything else to say?""

""No.""

""...Good."" A flicker of relief crossed his face, as if he'd expected a bigger fight.

He then continued, his tone all business. ""I'm taking Seraphina to a private retreat in the Rockies. Handle the ceremony preparations. Don't bother me with the details unless the world is ending.""

He cut the link.

I walked out to the balcony.

It used to be my herb garden, filled with rare plants I'd cultivated for the future of our pack.

I had imagined using these herbs to heal our people, to protect our home.

Damien had never set foot out here.

He said he wasn't interested in ""all these flowers and weeds.""

Now, they had lost their meaning, too.

I started working, one by one, uprooting the plants I had so carefully nurtured, the sharp snap of roots and the damp scent of earth filling the air.

It was a funeral for a future that was now dead and buried.

Each one represented a betrayed hope.

When the last Stardust Bloom was in its box, I took out my phone and opened the calendar.

On the date I had marked countless times for the ""Rite of the Moon Spring,"" I drew a heavy, red X.

The countdown: twelve days.

Chapter5

Over the next week, my phone was flooded with notifications.

Seraphina's social media was on fire.

A picture of her lying in a bed at a luxury resort in the Rockies, Damien sitting beside her, peeling an apple.

Her in a hot spring, with Damien on the edge, holding a towel ready for her.

Her during a prenatal check-up, Damien holding her hand tightly.

Every photo had the same caption: ""Thank you, Damien, for taking such good care of me. I've never felt so safe.""

I didn't need to read the comments.

""The Alpha is so good to her.""

""Now that's what true love looks like.""

""What about Luna Isla? We never see her.""

""I heard she's busy with her career.""

I turned off my phone and went back to packing.

On the third day, I drove to my parents' house.

""Isla?"" My mother opened the door, surprised. ""What are you doing here?""

""I need to talk to you both.""

In the living room, my father put down his newspaper and looked at me.

""What is it?""

""I'm going to Europe.""

""For a vacation?""

""For work. The Laurel Healers' Guild invited me to join a research project."" I took a deep breath. ""I might be gone for a long time.""

My mother's face fell. ""What about your ceremony?""

""It's been postponed.""

""Postponed?"" My father frowned. ""Why?""

""Damien has some things to take care of,"" I said, trying to sound calm. ""We thought it would be better to hold it later.""

My parents exchanged a look.

""Isla, don't lie to us,"" my mother said, her voice gentle but firm as she took my hand. ""We're your parents. We can see the pain in your eyes. Tell us what he did.""

I closed my eyes. ""It's nothing, Mom. I just want to learn more while I'm young.""

""Does Damien agree with this?""

""He's very supportive of my career.""

Another lie.

My father was silent for a long time before finally nodding. ""If it's for your career, we support you.""

""But you have to stay in touch,"" my mother said, her eyes glistening with tears. ""And take care of yourself.""

After leaving my parents' house, I texted Chloe.

""Can you come help me pack?""

An hour later, Chloe was at my apartment door.

""My god, what happened here?"" she asked, staring at the empty living room.

""I'm moving.""

""Moving where?""

""Switzerland.""

Chloe sat on the couch and studied my face. ""Okay. Now tell me the truth. What the hell happened?""

I told her everything.

From Damien demanding to mark Seraphina, to the pregnancy report, to the canceled Rite of the Moon Spring.

When I finished, the living room was dead silent.

Chloe's face grew darker and darker.

""That bastard!"" she suddenly exploded. ""How could he do this to you?""

""He had his reasons.""

""What reasons? Life debt?"" Chloe stood up and started pacing. ""Even if he owed her his life, he has no right to trample all over you like this!""

""Chloe—""

""No, I won't accept this!"" She spun to face me, her eyes burning. ""Five years ago, on the Blood Moon, you nearly tore your soul in half to save him from a rogue attack! And now he has the audacity to remember only her so-called 'kindness'?""

I looked away, saying nothing.

Chapter6

Five days until the ceremony.

I walked into the Pack Council chamber, dressed in a black power suit.

All the Elders were waiting for me.

""Isla, are you certain about this?"" the Head Elder asked, his voice grave.

""I am."" I placed the formal request on the table. ""I am petitioning to suspend the Mating Ceremony.""

The chamber fell silent.

""Why?"" the Second Elder asked.

""Personal reasons.""

""Personal reasons?"" the Third Elder stood up. ""This is about an alliance between two powerful families!""

""That's your concern,"" I said, turning to leave. ""My decision is final.""

Furious discussion erupted behind me, but I didn't look back.

When I got back to the apartment building, I saw the familiar black sedan.

They were back.

The elevator doors opened, and Damien and Seraphina were standing inside.

Seraphina looked well, a healthy flush on her cheeks.

Damien's arm was still wrapped protectively around her waist.

""Isla?"" Damien's eyes widened in surprise when he saw me. ""Where have you been?""

""Taking care of some business.""

We rode up together in a tense, suffocating silence.

""You cleared out the herb garden?"" Damien asked as he pushed open our apartment door and saw the empty balcony.

""Gave it away.""

""Why?""

""I don't need it anymore.""

Damien frowned but didn't press further.

Seraphina walked onto the balcony, feigning surprise. ""Wow, it's so empty. I bet it was beautiful before.""

""It was fine.""

""Isla, I'm so grateful for your understanding,"" Seraphina said, turning to me, a strange light in her eyes.

""Why don't we all have dinner together tonight? I'd love to thank you properly.""

I just stared at her.

Seeing my coldness, Seraphina's expression immediately changed, her eyes welling up with tears.

""Did... did I say something wrong?"" She turned to Damien, her voice trembling. ""I just wanted to show my gratitude...""

Damien's face instantly darkened.

""Isla,"" he growled, his voice laced with the Alpha command. ""Control yourself. Seraphina is our guest. You are making her uncomfortable.""

I looked at him calmly. ""Fine.""

At dinner, the nutrient broth arrived.

Damien had ordered it specially for Seraphina.

I recognized the scent immediately: Heart-leaf, an herb whose properties only activate for a she-wolf bonded to the Alpha who serves it.

He served a bowl and handed it to me. ""You should have some too. It's good for you.""

I took the bowl and sipped.

A foreign, repulsive energy instantly warred with my own.

My body recoiled, the rejection a physical, agonizing proof of his betrayal.

Damien froze.

He had forgotten.

That herb no longer worked for me.

My phone rang.

Ignoring Damien, I stepped out onto the balcony, sliding the glass door shut behind me before answering in a hushed voice.

""Miss Isla? This is the secretary from the Laurel Guild. Your flight has been confirmed.""

""Good,"" I said, my voice steady despite the turmoil inside me. ""The ceremony is off. I'm ready to leave.""

Just as I hung up, a deep, commanding voice came from behind me.

""Who's leaving?""

Chapter7

I spun around. Damien was standing just outside the balcony door, his eyes like chips of ice.

The lingering pain from the energy clash had made me forget—an Alpha’s hearing could cut straight through walls.

Thank the Goddess, he hadn’t heard everything.

""A healer friend of mine,"" I answered calmly , stepping past him and back into the dining room. ""She's going to South America to study new herbs.""

Damien walked over and sat back down. ""Which friend?""

""You don't know her.""

""Her name.""

""Why should I tell you?""

Seraphina coughed softly from the side. ""Damien, don't be so hard on Isla. A girl's secrets are important.""

Her words seemed to calm him down.

""Sorry,"" he said to me, though his eyes were still full of suspicion.

But he didn’t press further, seeming reluctant to sour the mood any more.

His gaze softened as he turned to Seraphina, pulling a beautiful box from his jacket.

""What's that?"" Seraphina asked curiously.

""It's for you.""

Inside was an obsidian pendant, carved with intricate runes.

I could read them clearly: Damien & Seraphina, Forever Bonded.

""It's gorgeous!"" Seraphina exclaimed, putting it on. ""Is this a mate's token?""

""Mmmhmm."" Damien fastened the chain for her. ""I've infused it with my Alpha energy. It will protect you and the pup.""

He took out his phone and snapped a picture of her in the mirror.

""Smile.""

She beamed like a child, her eyes shining with pure happiness.

Damien immediately sent her the photo with the caption: My precious one.

""It suits you,"" I commented.

Damien looked at me, a flicker of distance in his eyes.

The next afternoon, I went to the werewolf-exclusive apothecary to buy some last-minute travel supplies.

As I reached the door, I heard a familiar voice inside.

""Check the heartbeat again.""

It was Damien.

Through the glass, I could see Seraphina lying on a treatment bed, with Damien standing nervously beside her.

""Everything's normal,"" the pack healer said. ""The pup is very healthy.""

""Thank you,"" Damien said, taking Seraphina's hand. ""The healer says the pup will be very strong.""

I turned to leave, but the chime of the door gave me away.

""Isla?"" Seraphina called out from inside. ""Are you here for herbs too?""

""Just passing by.""

""Wait, we can leave together,"" she called back to Damien. ""I'll be right out.""

Ten minutes later, they came out together.

""How are the ceremony preparations going?"" Seraphina asked innocently. ""I hear it's going to be huge.""

""The ceremony will proceed as planned,"" Damien answered for me. ""It's just been delayed a bit.""

I looked at them and said nothing.

""Isla, I know you must be feeling hurt,"" Seraphina said, stepping closer to me. ""But I hope you don't give up on Damien. You're the one he truly loves.""

Her voice was sincere, her eyes brimming with tears.

""I don't deserve such a good man. You're his fated mate.""

Onlookers on the street started to whisper.

""That girl is so kind.""

""She's willing to suffer for someone else's happiness.""

""Why does that Isla woman look so cold?""

I turned and walked away.

""Isla!"" Seraphina called after me. ""Please don't misunderstand, I really don't want to take him from you!""

She ran up, trying to grab my arm.

""I know you're angry, but please, just give us a chance to explain—""

""Let go of me,"" I said, shaking her off.

The moment my hand made contact, she didn't just stumble.

She threw herself sideways with a theatrical gasp, aiming directly for the ancient laurel tree.

Laurel trees have a repulsive energy to weaker werewolves; she should have known that.

""Ah!"" she screamed, slamming hard against the trunk before collapsing to the ground in a heap.

""Seraphina!"" Damien roared, rushing to her side.

He saw her on the ground, then looked at my outstretched hand, and his eyes blazed with a fury I had never seen directed at me.

""What the hell did you do?!"" he roared, dropping to his knees beside her. ""How could you attack a pregnant she-wolf?!""

""I didn't—""

""Enough!"" Damien cut me off. ""In front of all these people, you will apologize to Seraphina! Now!""

Chapter8

""I'm not apologizing.""

My voice cut through the murmuring crowd.

Damien froze. ""What did you say?""

""I said, I am not apologizing."" I pointed to a nearby building. ""There's a security memory crystal on that building. It records everything. Shall we review the footage?""

The color drained from Seraphina's face.

""No... don't bother,"" she said weakly. ""It was probably just an accident...""

But her words were cut off by a pained groan.

""The energy backlash!"" She clutched her chest, her face turning even paler. ""The laurel tree's repelling energy is too strong!""

Damien immediately scooped her into his arms. ""Hang on. I'm taking you to the healers.""

He sprinted across the street to the healing center without a single glance back at me.

The crowd began to disperse, but the whispers continued.

""That Isla is so cold-blooded.""

""The poor girl is pregnant and hurt, and she won't even say sorry.""

""No wonder the Alpha prefers the gentle one.""

I stood there, staring in the direction of the healing center.

Then I turned and walked away.

The next day was the final day before the ceremony.

In the morning, I shipped all my luggage.

All that was left was a small backpack with my essentials and my plane ticket.

A three o'clock flight.

At ten that night, Damien finally returned.

""How is Seraphina?"" I asked.

""Stable,"" he said, his voice frigid. ""The pack healer said if she hadn't gotten there in time, she could have lost the pup.""

""That's good.""

Damien stalked over to me, the anger still simmering in his eyes.

""At the ceremony tomorrow,"" he commanded, his voice leaving no room for argument, ""you will make a public apology to her.""

""What ceremony?""

""Our Mating Ceremony."" He frowned. ""Did you forget?""

I looked at him and suddenly wanted to laugh.

""You really think there's going to be a ceremony?""

""Of course there is. I've already informed all the Elders."" Damien's tone grew impatient. ""For the sake of the pack's honor, you need to be the bigger person.""

His phone suddenly rang.

""Damien, I'm not feeling well,"" Seraphina's voice came through the speaker. ""Can you come be with me?""

Damien shot to his feet. ""I'm on my way.""

He grabbed his jacket and headed for the door.

""Nine a.m. tomorrow. Don't be late,"" he commanded without looking back. ""The ceremony will proceed on time.""

The moment the door clicked shut, I let the silence settle.

Then, I spoke the words into the empty room, each one a final, liberating vow.

""I, Isla, reject you, Damien.""

He was already gone.

I waited until morning.

Sitting at the dining table, I took out the calendar marked with the ceremony date.

With a red pen, on today's date, I wrote:

The Bond is Rejected.

Then I grabbed my suitcase and walked out of the place I had once called home.

On the way to the airport, I sent a single text to the Head Elder.

Initiate the Severing Ritual. The Mating Ceremony is canceled.

By 9:30 a.m., my plane was in the air.

Below me, the city—the pack, my past, him—shrank until it was swallowed by the clouds.

I pictured Damien in that moment.

He would have arrived at the sacred altar by now.

Dressed in his finest robes, waiting for his bride.

1mmd0wo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Contemporary_Romance/comments/1mmd0wo/captive_princess/,Captive Princess,"Three years ago, I drugged the mafia heir, Vincent.

After that one wild night, he didn’t kill me. Instead, he fucked me until my legs went weak, gripping my waist and whispering the same word over and over: “Principessa.”

Just as I was about to propose, his first love, Isabella, returned.

To keep her happy, Vincent let a car hit me, had my mother’s heirlooms thrown to stray dogs, and sent me to prison…

But when I was finally broken, flying to Boston to marry someone else, Vincent tore New York City apart to find me.

Chapter 1

To the world, I'm Sophia Romano—the family's wild, radiant princess. Vincent is the mafia heir—stoic, controlled, the very picture of restraint.

But every night, he grips my waist, fucking me until my legs go weak while whispering my name over and over: ""Principessa.""

He just doesn't know that in two weeks, I'm marrying someone else.

The sheets are still damp with our shared heat. I lie in bed, catching my breath as Vincent rises to dress.

From my side of the bed, I watch his long fingers deftly buttoning his shirt.

""Not staying tonight?"" I ask.

""Family meeting,"" he says without turning. ""Be good.""

That again.

I sit up, letting the sheet pool around my waist. Vincent's hands pause for a moment before he moves to knot his tie.

""Vincent.""

""Hmm?""

""Nothing.""

He turns, leans down, and presses a kiss to my forehead. ""I'm leaving.""

The moment the door clicks shut, I snatch my phone and dial a familiar number.

""Father, I accept the marriage alliance. In two weeks, I'll marry the dying Sterling heir in Boston. But I have one condition.""

On the other end of the line, Don Romano sounds ecstatic. ""Good! Name it!""

""We'll talk in person.""

I hang up, and my eyes fall on the phone Vincent left on the nightstand.

The screen lights up with a new message.

From: Isabella

Vincent, thanks for coming with me to the hospital today. The doctor said my recovery is going well, and it's all because of you. I'd love to see a movie with you tomorrow, just like old times.

It's followed by a kissing emoji.

I stare at the message, my fingertips trembling.

Vincent has never taken me to the hospital. Not even when I broke a rib during training.

I get dressed and discreetly follow his car.

He pulls up to a cozy Italian restaurant on Mott Street. From a distance, I watch him stride toward a girl in a white dress.

Isabella.

She's even thinner than she appears in photos. Vincent reaches out, tucking a windswept strand of hair behind her ear. He touches her as if she's made of porcelain, liable to shatter at any moment.

I've never seen him look so gentle, except when we're in bed.

Three years ago, my father sent me to Vincent. The sight of his handsome, cold face made my knees weak.

""Sophia needs a proper education in how our family operates,"" Don Romano had told Vincent. ""She's too wild. You're the only one who can handle her.""

I was nineteen then, fresh out of boarding school and brimming with rebellion. I thought Vincent was just another man trying to tame me.

So I decided I would tame him first.

The first time we met, I wore a miniskirt to his office just to provoke him. Vincent sat behind his desk and didn't even bother to look up.

""Close your legs, Sophia.""

""Why?""

""Because the way you're sitting suggests the Romano family lacks class.""

I deliberately hiked my skirt higher. ""How about now?""

Vincent finally looked up, his eyes cold behind his gold-rimmed glasses. ""Get out.""

For months, I did everything I could to get under his skin. I slipped flirtatious notes into his files, sabotaged missions he assigned, and even put a laxative in his whiskey.

Vincent always cleaned up my messes with infuriating calm, then told me in that patronizing tone, ""Sophia, you're a smart girl. You need to apply that intelligence to the right things.""

Until that night.

I drugged his drink, desperate to see what a Vincent without his iron control would look like.

I just didn't expect to still be in the room when the drug took hold.

Vincent pinned my wrists, his breathing heavy and ragged. ""What did you put in my drink?""

""You've already guessed, haven't you?"" I met his searing gaze. ""Want to try me?""

That night changed everything.

When I woke the next morning, Vincent was already dressed.

I thought he'd be furious, that he'd send me back to my father. ""Vincent, I—""

""Principessa,"" he murmured, stroking my cheek. ""This will be our secret.""

Principessa. Little princess.

That was the word that made me fall completely.

For the next two years, we maintained this strange, clandestine relationship. By day, he was the same composed, rational Vincent. But at night, he'd whisper ""Principessa"" in my ear and fuck me until my legs gave out.

I thought he loved me.

Until my birthday.

I'd spent the entire day preparing, put on my most beautiful dress, and booked a table at the restaurant where we first met. I was going to tell him I loved him, that I wanted to be with him, no matter the cost.

But Vincent never showed up.

I sat alone in that restaurant for three hours, until even the waiters started to look at me with pity.

The next day, photos of Vincent greeting another woman at the airport went viral.

In the pictures, Isabella was nestled in his arms, the two of them as intimate as lovers.

So that’s where he'd been last night. He'd gone to pick her up.

I laughed bitterly and drank until I couldn't feel anything. I wanted to confront him, to demand to know what I was to him. A fuck buddy? A tool?

But I didn't have the courage.

I was too lonely, too addicted to the warmth he offered.

That night, Vincent came home to find a wreck. I'd used a wine bottle to smash every single picture of Isabella in his study.

He didn't even flinch. He just instructed the maid to clean up the mess and take care of me, then walked right past me.

In that moment, I finally understood. Vincent was the family heir—untouchable, cold, and proud. His tolerance wasn't a sign of affection. He simply couldn't be bothered to argue with me.

After that, he still called me Principessa in bed, as if nothing had changed.

But my heart was already dead.

Outside the restaurant, Vincent opened the car door for Isabella. They were laughing about something.

I looked away and drove back to the Romano family estate.

In the living room, Don Romano and my stepmother, Maria, were watching TV. When I walked in, my father turned it off.

""Alright, what's your condition?""

I sat on the sofa opposite them. ""I want you to disown me.""

Don Romano's expression froze. ""What did you say?""

Maria, sitting beside him, practically lit up.

""I said, I'll marry the Sterling family's dying heir. In exchange, we sever all ties. From this moment on, I am no longer a Romano. You can welcome your mistress and your bastard daughter into this home with open arms. The day you staged the car crash that killed my mother, I stopped wanting you as a father anyway!""

Don Romano's face turned ashen. ""I told you, that crash was an accident!""

I met his gaze and sneered. ""Accident or not, she died on her way to find you cheating with Maria. Dad, let's stop pretending we're a happy family. You've been trying to sell me to the Sterlings for five months. Isn't it just so your precious mistress can finally marry into the family, so your bastard daughter can finally take the Romano name?""

Don Romano shot to his feet. ""Sophia, you want to be disowned? Fine! As of tomorrow, you are no longer my daughter!""

""Deal,"" I said, turning to head upstairs. ""Oh, and don't forget to inform the Sterling family. Their bride is no longer the eldest daughter of the Romano family, but a parentless orphan. Ask them if they're still willing to pay the same price.""

Back in my room, I shut the door, and the mask I wore finally crumbled.

Tears streamed down my face. I curled up on the bed, a wounded animal licking its wounds.

Do you know, Vincent? To finally leave you, I had to give up the only thing I had left.

The next morning, I heard the sounds of furniture being moved downstairs.

I rose and walked to the landing of the staircase.

A familiar figure stood at the bottom.

Isabella.

My blood ran cold.

Chapter 2

Isabella stood at the bottom of the stairs in a simple white dress, the picture of fragile innocence.

She spotted me, and a brilliant smile spread across her face. ""You must be Sophia. I'm Isabella. It's a pleasure to finally meet you.""

I didn't answer, just stared down at her.

Don Romano emerged from the living room. Seeing Isabella, a rare look of paternal affection crossed his features.

""Isabella, you must be tired from your journey. Have Sophia show you to your room.""

""Thank you, Uncle Romano,"" Isabella replied sweetly.

""Take Sophia's room. It gets the best light, perfect for your recovery,"" Don Romano announced.

I turned to him. ""My room?""

""From now on, it's Isabella's room. You can move to the third floor. There's an empty guest room up there.""

A cold laugh escaped my lips. ""No, thanks.""

I went back upstairs and began to pack.

Thirty minutes later, I was dragging my suitcase down the stairs.

Don Romano saw my luggage and frowned. ""Where do you think you're going?""

""I'm leaving,"" I said without looking back. ""Since I'm no longer a Romano, there's no reason for me to stay here.""

""Sophia!"" he yelled after me. ""Your wedding is in two weeks! Don't be ridiculous!""

""I know."" I pulled the door open. ""I'll be at the wedding to fulfill our agreement.""

The door slammed shut behind me. I drove away from the Romano estate without a second glance.

My first stop was the most expensive hotel in Manhattan—The Plaza.

""I'd like your most expensive suite,"" I told the concierge.

""For how many nights?""

""Two weeks. ""

When I paid, I used the supplementary credit card Don Romano had given me. It had a five-million-dollar limit that I had rarely touched.

Today, I was going to max it out.

Once in the suite, I immediately began my revenge spending.

I contacted Vera Wang's private couturier and ordered three bespoke wedding gowns, each worth a hundred thousand dollars.

Then I bought ten sets of high jewelry and two limited-edition Rolexes.

In a single day, I spent nearly four million dollars.

Soon enough, Don Romano's call came through.

""Sophia! Are you out of your mind? You spent four million in one day!""

""What's wrong?"" I asked, lounging on the hotel's plush leather sofa. ""I'm being shipped off to Boston. A girl has to make a good impression.""

""You need to spend that much to make an impression?""

""Of course,"" I said, sipping my champagne. ""I'm marrying the heir to the Sterling family. I can't look cheap, can I? Besides, the Sterlings are paying five hundred million for this alliance. A few million is pocket change.""

""You..."" Don Romano was sputtering with rage.

""Father—oh, wait, I should call you Mr. Romano now,"" I laughed. ""You already disowned me, so it's not right for me to spend your money. How about this: as soon as the alliance funds arrive, I'll pay you back immediately.""

I hung up and continued my shopping spree.

My plan was simple: drain the Romano family's liquid assets before the alliance money came through. Then, the five hundred million would go directly into my account. If Don Romano wanted it, he'd have to come begging.

Let's see if he'd still favor that mother and daughter then.

Just as I was about to make my final round of purchases, my phone buzzed.

It was a text from Vincent. ""You haven't been to the compound in three days. Is something wrong?""

I stared at the message, my heart suddenly hammering against my ribs.

But I quickly composed myself. Vincent just hated it when his orders were disobeyed. That's all this was.

I replied: ""Family stuff. It'll be sorted out in a few days.""

Vincent didn't write back.

The next morning, as I was heading out to continue my sartorial assault, the hotel concierge stopped me. ""Miss Romano, I'm terribly sorry, but your account has been frozen. You cannot continue to charge to your room.""

""What do you mean?""

""You'll need to settle your bill immediately, or..."" He paused delicately. ""We'll have to ask you to leave.""

An hour later, I was standing on the sidewalk outside The Plaza with my luggage.

Penniless and homeless.

I couldn't bring myself to sell the luxury goods I'd bought. I needed them as my armor for Boston.

I thought about calling a friend, but then I realized I didn't have any. The people who flocked around me were only there for the Romano family's power and influence.

Now that I'd been cast out, who would bother with me?

As dusk fell, I dragged my suitcase aimlessly through the streets.

Finally, I found an empty bench in Central Park and sat down.

The night grew deep. The park was quiet, save for the distant hum of traffic.

I hugged my knees, counting down the five days until the wedding. I couldn't live on the streets until then.

As I worried, a few drunk men staggered toward me.

""Hey, beautiful. All alone?"" one of them slurred, reeking of cheap booze.

I stood up warily. ""Stay away from me.""

""Don't be like that,"" the man said, reaching for me. ""C'mon, have a drink with us.""

I stepped back, but the bench blocked my escape.

Just then, a low, menacing voice cut through the air.

""She's with me.""

I turned. Vincent was stepping out of the shadows, his face a thunderous mask of fury.

The drunks took one look at his imposing presence and scrambled away.

Vincent strode toward me, his gaze taking in my suitcases, then the bench.

""Homeless, and you still won't come to me?""

Chapter 3

Vincent drove me back to his mansion in Manhattan.

I sat in the passenger seat, staring out at the passing neon lights, a gaping void in my chest.

""We're here."" Vincent parked the car and walked around to open my door.

Why was it always like this? He didn't love me, but he slept with me, and he was still so damn considerate.

A lump formed in my throat.

I got out of the car and followed him, dragging my suitcase behind me.

I knew this house all too well. Every corner held a memory of our bodies tangled together.

Vincent reached for my suitcase, about to take it to my usual bedroom.

""Don't,"" I said, heading straight for a guest room. ""I'm only staying for twelve days. This is fine.""

Vincent stopped in his tracks. ""You can stay as long as you want.""

I put my suitcase in the guest room and closed the door.

I sat on the edge of the bed, staring at my phone. Twelve more days, and I would leave New York forever.

The next morning, I went downstairs. Vincent was already in the dining room. He saw me and gestured to the seat across from him.

I sat. A maid brought me milk and toast.

""Vincent,"" I began.

He looked up, his gaze calm behind his glasses.

""Did you know Isabella is Maria's daughter?""

""I found out yesterday,"" he said, his face unreadable, showing no hint of guilt.

I gave a bitter smile. ""What is Isabella to you?""

Vincent put down his coffee cup. ""A high school classmate. She took a bullet for me once, saved my life. She's been recovering in Europe ever since.""

""Really? Just a classmate? A savior? Is it that simple?""

Vincent's brow furrowed slightly. ""Sophia, I don't want you targeting her just because she has returned to the Romano family.""

I laughed, the sound sharp and humorless. ""Is that a warning?""

""It's a reminder,"" Vincent's tone was cold. ""Isabella's health is fragile. She can't handle any trouble.""

I nodded, saying nothing more.

Vincent was more direct in his defense of Isabella than I had ever imagined. What else was there to ask?

""I understand,"" I said, getting to my feet. ""I'm going upstairs.""

I stayed in the guest room all day. The maid brought lunch and dinner to my door. I didn't go down.

That night, I lay in bed, unable to sleep. Usually, Vincent would open the door around this time, push me down without a word, and grip my waist while calling me Principessa.

But tonight, the hallway was silent.

Of course. His first love was back. Why would he be thinking of me?

The next day was Saturday. Vincent didn't go to the compound.

At ten in the morning, he knocked on my door.

""Sophia, there's a party tonight. You're coming with me.""

I opened the door. Vincent was already dressed in a sharp black suit.

""What party?""

""A gathering between the families.""

Not wanting to be alone in this house full of our memories, I nodded.

At seven that evening, Vincent's car pulled up to a private club.

I followed him inside and found the place lavishly decorated with flowers and streamers.

It didn't look like any mafia gathering I'd ever been to.

Before I could ask, I heard a familiar voice.

""Vincent! You're finally here!""

Isabella, in a white evening gown, fluttered over like a butterfly. She saw me, and her expression faltered for a fraction of a second before she plastered on a sweet smile.

""Sophia's here too! That's wonderful!""

I glanced around and saw a large banner that read, ""Welcome Home, Isabella.""

It was a welcome party. For her.

Vincent had brought me to Isabella's welcome home party.

I turned to leave, but Isabella stopped me.

""Sophia, what's wrong? Are you not feeling well?"" she asked, her voice dripping with concern. ""I heard you moved out of your house. Is it because of me? I'm so sorry, I had no idea Uncle Romano would let me stay in your room.""

Her voice was soft and gentle, but loud enough for everyone around us to hear. A few guests looked my way with questioning eyes.

""It's fine,"" I replied curtly. ""It's just a room.""

""But Uncle Romano said you even disowned him."" Isabella's eyes welled with tears. ""It's all my fault. If I hadn't come back...""

""Isabella,"" I cut her off. ""The reason I disowned him has nothing to do with an outsider like you.""

Isabella's tears began to fall. She looked pitifully at Vincent.

Vincent walked over, shot me a warning look, then said gently to Isabella, ""Don't cry. Your eyes will get swollen.""

He took out a handkerchief and dabbed at her tears. Isabella's tears turned to a smile. She blinked her wet lashes and said, ""You're so good to me, Vincent.""

I stood to the side, watching this tender tableau unfold.

A sharp pain pierced my heart.

In ten days, I would be gone for good, and I knew I would never be on the receiving end of that kind of tenderness from him.

I turned and walked to the bar, grabbed a glass of champagne, and downed most of it in one go.

Chapter 4

Once the party started, I realized just how attentive Vincent was to Isabella.

He pulled out her chair, fetched her drinks, and even adjusted the strap of her dress when it slipped, his hand brushing her shoulder with a familiar ease.

I had never received any of that.

In the two years I was with Vincent, he had never done those things for me. I thought it was just his personality—cool and reserved, above such trivial gestures of affection.

I was wrong.

He just wasn't willing to do them for me.

I nursed my champagne, listening to Isabella laugh and chat with other guests. She spoke of her recovery in Europe, of how much she missed New York. Every word was graceful and proper.

""Isabella is such a lovely girl,"" a woman next to me whispered to her friend. ""The way Vincent looks after her, they're sure to end up together.""

My hand tightened around the stem of my glass.

""Alright, everyone, let's play a game!"" the host announced, livening up the room. ""Truth or Choice!""

The big screen lit up as the host explained the rules. ""Two pictures will appear on the screen. Everyone votes for their favorite, but Vincent, as our guest of honor, you'll make the final choice for everyone!""

The first set of photos was of two different red wines. Vincent chose the one on the left without hesitation.

""Because Isabella is sensitive to anything too strong,"" he explained.

The room erupted in good-natured teasing.

The second set was two bouquets: red roses and white lilies. Vincent chose the lilies.

""Isabella prefers a more subtle fragrance.""

The third set was two vacation spots: the Maldives and Switzerland.

""Switzerland. Isabella needs fresh air for her recovery.""

Every choice Vincent made was for Isabella.

I watched him on stage and thought about our two years together. He had never asked what I liked, never remembered my favorite food or where I dreamed of going.

""Last round!"" the host said excitedly. ""This one's a little special. It's photos of two beautiful women!""

Two pictures appeared on the screen.

On the left was Isabella. She was in a white dress, smiling faintly in a garden, looking as pure as an angel.

On the right was me. I was in a crimson evening gown from some forgotten party, my gaze fiery and defiant.

The room fell silent.

All eyes were on Vincent.

He stood on stage, staring at the screen, and for a few seconds, he said nothing.

Those few seconds stretched into an eternity.

I knew he would choose Isabella, but I still clung to a final, desperate sliver of hope that he would choose me.

Even if it was just for show. Even if it was out of pity.

""I choose..."" Vincent's voice echoed through the microphone. ""Isabella.""

The crowd burst into loud applause and cheers.

I set my champagne glass down, turned, and rushed out of the room.

In the bathroom, I stared at my reflection in the mirror, taking deep, shuddering breaths, trying to calm the storm inside me.

I shouldn't have expected anything. Not from the very beginning.

I composed myself and walked out, ready to return to the party.

The hallway was dimly lit. As I rounded a corner, a few drunk men blocked my path.

""Hey, beautiful. All alone?"" one of them slurred, stumbling closer. ""Have a drink with us.""

""Get out of my way,"" I said, my voice dangerously low.

""Don't be so cold,"" another one jeered, reaching for me. ""We just want to get to know you...""

I backed away and saw Vincent standing in the doorway of our private room.

He was talking to a guest. I shot him a desperate, pleading look.

Vincent saw me. His face darkened, and he started to walk over.

Just then, a cry of pain came from inside the room. ""Ouch! My foot...""

Vincent immediately spun around. He saw Isabella clutching a chair, her face pale.

""What's wrong?"" he asked, rushing to her side.

""I think I twisted my ankle..."" Isabella said, her eyes welling with tears.

Vincent immediately knelt to examine her ankle, completely forgetting about me in the hallway.

Isabella whispered something to him. Without even looking back in my direction, Vincent replied, ""Don't worry about it. She can handle herself.""

In that moment, my heart didn't just break. It shattered.

I grabbed a wine bottle from a nearby service table and smashed it against the wall.

Shards of glass flew everywhere. The sound startled the drunk men.

I held up the broken bottle, the jagged glass pointed at them. ""Get lost!""

Seeing the feral fury in my eyes, they scrambled away.

The glass had cut my palm. Blood dripped onto the floor.

I looked at the wound, feeling the sting. What was this little bit of pain compared to the agony in my soul?

After the party, I stood alone outside the club, waiting for a car.

Isabella came out, with Vincent carefully helping her walk.

""Sophia,"" Isabella said, hobbling over to me. ""I'm so sorry about what happened earlier. I twisted my ankle so suddenly, Vincent couldn't get to you. But it looks like you handled it well.""

She glanced at my injured hand, a flash of triumph in her eyes.

""I did,"" I said with a cold smile. ""I've always been good at handling my own problems.""

""That's good,"" Isabella smiled sweetly. ""To be honest, I was a little worried when Vincent brought you tonight. After all, you two used to...""

""Used to what?""

""You don't actually think Vincent has special feelings for you, do you?"" Isabella leaned in, her voice a low, venomous whisper. ""Sophia, dear, Vincent just pities you. You're homeless now, so he took you in out of charity. That's all.""

""Is that so?""

""Of course,"" Isabella's eyes were sharp and malicious. ""You saw the game tonight. Vincent only has room in his heart for me. It's been that way since high school. That will never change.""

Just then, a black sedan lost control and sped straight toward us.

In a split second, Vincent lunged forward and threw his arms around Isabella, shielding her with his body.

And me? I was struck hard by the out-of-control car and thrown violently to the ground.

Chapter 5

As the car hit me, my consciousness began to fade.

Pain shot through my entire body, but what hurt more was the absolute, crushing despair of being abandoned.

Flashes of memory flooded my mind.

The first time I saw Vincent, sitting behind his desk, the cold light glinting off his glasses. Me, deliberately provoking him, and him, completely unmoved.

The first time he pinned me down, calling me Principessa, his voice low and ragged. I had thought it was love.

Countless nights, lying in his arms, listening to the steady beat of his heart, thinking I had finally found my home.

The final image was frozen in my mind: Vincent, without a moment's hesitation, diving to protect Isabella.

And me, like some disposable bystander, left to face the danger all alone.

When I opened my eyes again, I was in a hospital bed.

The room was quiet, but I could hear Vincent on the phone just outside my curtain.

""Isabella, does it still hurt?"" His voice was so gentle it felt alien to me.

""Much better, thank you, Vincent,"" Isabella's voice was frail. ""If you hadn't grabbed me in time, I might have...""

""Don't think about that,"" Vincent soothed her. ""The doctor said you were just shaken up, no external injuries.""

""Vincent, if it happened again, you would still save me first, right?""

Vincent didn't hesitate. ""Of course.""

""But Sophia got hit...""

""She has no reason to be angry,"" Vincent's voice was calm, logical. ""In an emergency, of course I'm going to save the more fragile person. She understands that.""

I closed my eyes, feeling as if someone had just plunged a knife into my heart.

So, in Vincent's mind, I didn't even have the right to be angry.

Footsteps approached, and the curtain around my bed was pulled back.

Vincent stood there. Seeing that I was awake, his face held not a single trace of guilt. ""You're awake?""

""Yeah,"" my voice was hoarse.

""The doctor said you have a mild concussion and some scrapes on your leg. Nothing serious,"" Vincent said. ""I've arranged for the best medical team. I'll stay here to take care of you for the next few days.""

""Thanks,"" I said, staring up at the ceiling. ""I'll pay you back for the medical bills in ten days.""

Vincent frowned. ""What are you talking about? What's in ten days?""

""I said I'll pay you back,"" I turned to look at him, my gaze flat. ""And for the cost of my stay at your place. I'll settle it all at once.""

Vincent's expression was strained. ""Sophia, you don't have to keep score with me.""

""Why not?"" my voice was devoid of emotion. ""We were never anything to each other, were we?""

The room fell silent for a few long seconds.

Vincent seemed to want to say something, but in the end, he just said, ""Get some rest.""

For the next few days, Vincent did stay at the hospital to look after me.

He checked on me regularly, made sure the nurses gave me my medication on time, and even tested the temperature of my food before letting me eat it.

But I remained cold and distant.

I didn't cry, didn't throw tantrums, didn't demand his attention. I treated him like a kind stranger, polite but utterly detached.

This new version of me seemed to make Vincent uncomfortable.

On the third afternoon, Vincent sat in the chair by my bed, watching me listlessly flip through a magazine.

""Sophia,"" he began.

""Hmm?"" I didn't look up.

""About that night..."" Vincent paused. ""I saved Isabella first, but it wasn't because I didn't want to save you.""

He continued, ""Isabella's body is weak. She couldn't have survived the impact. It was the only logical choice...""

I put down the magazine, cutting him off. ""I know.""

Vincent looked at me, a strange, unreadable emotion in his eyes. ""You're really not angry?""

""Do you want me to be?""

Just then, a commotion erupted in the hallway.

""Hurry! Get her to the ER!""

""What happened?""

""Miss Isabella fell down the stairs! She's hurt badly!""

The color drained from Vincent's face.

He shot to his feet. ""I have to go handle something,"" he said quickly.

He walked to the door, then glanced back at me. ""I'll be back to check on you later.""

I listened to his hurried footsteps fade down the hall and closed my eyes, a wave of profound exhaustion washing over me.

Isabella had once again succeeded in taking Vincent away from me.

And I no longer had the strength to fight for him.

In a week, he'd be free to be with her anyway.

Chapter 6

I woke from a doze to a sharp, stinging pain in my arm.

Looking down, I saw my IV line had backed up with blood, a crimson line creeping steadily up the clear tube.

I pressed the call button.

A nurse bustled in and frowned at the IV. ""Why is no one watching you? Where's your boyfriend?""

""He's not my boyfriend,"" I said calmly. ""He had to leave for something important.""

""How long ago?"" the nurse asked, skillfully changing the needle.

I glanced at the clock on the wall. It was two in the morning. Vincent had left at seven in the evening. Seven hours ago.

""A long time ago.""

The nurse shook her head with a sigh. ""That's how it is with these rich guys. They put on a good show, but they're never around when it counts.""

After she left, I couldn't get back to sleep.

When morning came, I decided to go for a walk.

Dragging my IV stand into the hallway, I overheard two nurses talking quietly.

""That girl in the VIP wing is so lucky. Her boyfriend booked the entire floor for her.""

""I heard he even flew in specialists from overseas for 24/7 care.""

""The heir to the Marcelli family is so good to her. He hasn't left her side since she was admitted.""

I stopped.

The VIP wing was on the tenth floor. I was on the eighth, in a standard private room.

I pressed the elevator button and went up to the tenth floor.

The entire floor was indeed cordoned off. Only one room was lit.

I walked to the door and peered through the small window.

Vincent was sitting by the bed, patiently spoon-feeding Isabella porridge. She was propped up against a mountain of pillows, her face pale but content.

""Does it still hurt?"" Vincent asked softly.

""Much better,"" Isabella said, opening her mouth for another spoonful. ""With you here, I'm not afraid of anything.""

Don Romano was sitting on the sofa, peeling an apple for her. As soon as she finished the porridge, he handed her a small slice.

""Eat slowly. Don't choke,"" the Don's voice was laced with an affection I hadn't heard in years.

""Uncle Romano, you're so good to me,"" Isabella smiled sweetly. ""Just like a real father.""

""You are my daughter now,"" Don Romano said, patting her hand. ""This family is your home.""

Vincent smiled gently and reached out to smooth Isabella's hair. ""Is your head still spinning?""

""No, just a little tired.""

""Then get some more sleep,"" Vincent said, closing the curtains and dimming the lights. ""I'll be right here with you.""

The tender, domestic scene was a knife twisting in my heart.

I bit my lip so hard I could taste blood, forcing myself not to cry out.

I turned away from the VIP wing and went back to my own room.

Don't cry, Sophia. You can't cry.

Four days before I was scheduled to fly to Boston for the wedding, I was discharged.

As I stepped out of the hospital, I saw Vincent leaning against his black car, waiting.

""Get in,"" he said.

""I'll get a cab.""

""Get in."" Vincent's tone left no room for argument.

I looked at his cold, hard expression and finally slid into the car.

""Where are we going?"" I asked.

""To clear your head,"" Vincent said, starting the car. ""You've been cooped up in the hospital for too long.""

Half an hour later, he pulled up in front of Sotheby's auction house in Midtown.

""An auction?"" I looked at the poster by the entrance.

""There's an art auction today,"" Vincent said, getting out. ""I thought you liked this sort of thing.""

I was about to refuse, but when he handed me the auction catalog, my eyes caught a familiar item.

Lot 47: A Pearl Necklace.

My hands began to shake.

I knew that necklace. It was my mother's. It was the only thing I had left of her.

""What's wrong?"" Vincent noticed my reaction.

""Nothing,"" I clutched the catalog tightly. ""Let's go in.""

In the restroom, I dialed my lawyer's number with trembling fingers.

""Sell everything I have. All of it. Now.""

""Miss Sophia, you said you wanted to take those things to Boston...""

""I changed my mind,"" I said urgently. ""How much can I get?""

""Around fifteen million dollars.""

""That's enough."" I hung up and took a deep breath.

I had to get my mother's necklace back.

We walked into the auction hall, and Vincent found us seats near the front.

Just as I was about to sit, a familiar voice called out.

""Vincent!""

Isabella walked over, wearing a pale pink dress. Her head was still wrapped in gauze, but she was as beautiful and fragile as ever.

She linked her arm through Vincent's.

""Sophia's here too,"" Isabella said, smiling sweetly at me. ""I told Vincent I wanted to apologize to you in person today. I didn't think he'd actually bring you to the auction.""

In that moment, everything became painfully clear.

Vincent didn't bring me here to cheer me up or clear my head.

He brought me because Isabella wanted to ""apologize,"" and I was just a prop he brought along for the ride.

I looked at Isabella's triumphant smile, and the last bit of pain in my heart vanished, replaced by a cold, hard numbness.

I couldn't feel anything anymore.

Chapter 7

The auction began.

I clutched my bidding paddle, my eyes fixed on the stage, waiting for lot number 47.

Finally, the auctioneer held up the pearl necklace.

""Lot number 47, a stunning pearl necklace. Bidding starts at five hundred thousand dollars.""

I immediately raised my paddle. ""Five hundred thousand.""

""One million,"" Isabella's voice chimed in from beside me.

I turned to look at her. Isabella was smiling, holding her own paddle high.

""One point five million,"" I countered, my voice tight.

""Two million,"" Isabella said without a flicker of hesitation.

The price began to skyrocket.

Three million, five million, eight million...

My palms grew sweaty. My lawyer had said my assets were worth fifteen million, but the bidding was already approaching twenty.

""Twenty million,"" Isabella raised her paddle effortlessly, as if naming a trivial sum.

The auctioneer looked at me. ""Ma'am, do you wish to continue?""

My hand trembled. I couldn't raise the paddle again.

I didn't have enough money.

All eyes in the room were on me, including Vincent's.

I swallowed my pride and turned to him.

""Vincent, lend me the money,"" my voice shook. ""Please. It was my mother's necklace. It's the only thing she left me.""

Vincent looked at me, a complex, unreadable emotion in his eyes. Just as he was about to reach for his black card...

Isabella turned to him too, her voice a sweet, cloying whine. ""Vincent, I've never had anything nice in my whole life. This is the first time I've ever loved a piece of jewelry this much. Can you please ask Sophia to let me have it?""

She tugged on his sleeve, her eyes wide and pleading.

Vincent's gaze shifted between me and Isabella.

Those few seconds felt like a century.

""Let Isabella have it,"" Vincent finally said, his voice terrifyingly calm.

My world collapsed.

""Twenty million, going once!"" the auctioneer's voice boomed.

""Twenty million, going twice!""

I wanted to scream, to beg Vincent again, but the words were stuck in my throat, choked by betrayal.

""Twenty million, sold!""

The moment the gavel fell, my heart died completely.

Isabella clapped excitedly, then turned to me. ""Sophia, thank you!""

The triumph on her face was undisguised.

After the auction, Vincent left to get medicine for Isabella, who was suddenly claiming to have a headache.

I sat alone on a plush sofa in the lounge, watching the staff pack up the remaining lots.

Ten minutes later, Isabella came backstage and walked up to me.

I stood up to face her.

""Isabella, I'll trade you for the necklace. Anything.""

""Like what?"" Isabella raised a perfectly sculpted eyebrow.

""I have a Ferrari, and some designer watches. The total value isn't twenty million, but give me some time, and I'll get you the rest..."" I struggled to keep my voice steady. ""Just give me back the necklace.""

Isabella shook her head. ""I don't need any of that.""

""Then what do you want?""

Isabella feigned a thoughtful expression, then a cruel smile spread across her face. ""I want you to get on your knees and beg me for it.""

""What?""

""Kneel. Apologize for how you've treated me. And then beg me to give you the necklace,"" Isabella's eyes glinted with malice. ""You were so awful to me before. Now it's your turn to beg.""

I stared at her, my fists clenched at my sides.

But the thought of my mother's necklace, my last link to her, made me slowly, agonizingly, begin to bend my knees.

""Good girl. But first, let me show you where the necklace is now."" Isabella laughed triumphantly and took out her phone.

She played a video and held it in front of my face.

On the screen, a filthy stray dog was wagging its tail. Draped around its neck was a string of lustrous pearls.

My mother's necklace.

""See? This is where it belongs now,"" Isabella smiled sweetly. ""I think it's a perfect match. A bitch for a bitch.""

My blood ran cold.

""What did you say?""

""I said, a bitch for a bitch,"" Isabella put her phone away, her smile unwavering. ""Wasn't your mother a bitch? She deserved to be hit by that car. Now her necklace is on a dog. It's fitting, don't you think?""

""Which hand did you use to put it on the dog?"" my voice was a whisper, so quiet I could barely hear it myself.

""My right hand. Why?"" Isabella was still smiling, savoring her victory.

The next second, I snatched a steak knife from a nearby catering table and plunged it straight through the back of her right hand, pinning it to the tablecloth beneath.

Blood gushed out. Isabella let out a piercing, agonized scream.

Chapter 8

Isabella's scream echoed through the backstage area.

The staff froze in shock. Some started screaming in panic, others fumbled for their phones to call for an ambulance.

I pulled the knife free and stood up straight.

""A Romano always repays their debts,"" I said, looking down at Isabella, who was writhing on the floor, clutching her bleeding hand and sobbing. ""Remember that.""

I turned and walked away, the sounds of chaos fading behind me.

**About Me**

I’m a 27-year-old guy based in Pune. By day, I work with numbers, and by early morning, I’m a disciplined gym-goer. I’d describe myself as an energetic, kind-hearted soul with a big dose of discipline and a sprinkle of nerdiness. I believe in constant growth and effort in a relationship, and I’d love to find someone who shares that belief.

**Lifestyle & Beliefs**

I’m a vegetarian (with eggs included for that protein boost 💪), a non-smoker, and I only drink on rare social occasions. Think raising a toast to a big life win or a random Friday we both take off to trek in the hills. I’m also an atheist (more of a “spiritual-but-not-religious” type). I respect all cultures and love a good festival celebration, but you’ll never catch me stuck in rigid rituals or dogma.

**Career & Ambitions**

I work in finance, and I genuinely enjoy the grind. Ambitious about my career,

**Health & Hobbies**

Fitness is a big part of my life. The gym is like my second home, and I’m into weight training and functional fitness. When I’m not lifting or planning my next workout, I love hitting the highway for impromptu road trips and strapping on my boots for a trek in the Sahyadris. Catching a sunrise from a mountaintop or a quiet lake is my idea of magic. (Life is a bit like a trek – challenging but rewarding, and best enjoyed with a great companion by your side.)

**Passions & Pastimes:** I also love to read at times, I believe in exercising the mind as much as the body. And coffee? Yes, please! I’m always up for exploring a new café or perfecting my home brew. Maybe one day we can swap favourite book recommendations over a steaming cup or plan our next trip while sipping cappuccinos.

**Childfree & Values**: I’m 100% childfree – no kids now, no kids ever. Honestly, have you seen the cost of raising a child these days? I’d rather invest in us – in travel, hobbies, and building our future. (Childfreedom has its financial perks, right?) I’m so serious about this lifestyle that I’m open to getting a vasectomy once we’re solid in our commitment, just to lock in our mutual decision.

I value loyalty, honesty, respect, and mutual growth. I’m the kind of person who will stand by my partner through thick and thin. When I commit, I’m all in. Good communication is huge for me. no drama or mind games; let’s talk things out openly like adults. I believe in treating my partner as an equal – whether it’s making big life decisions or doing the dishes after dinner, it’s a team effort. I pull my weight in a relationship, and I find fairness incredibly attractive. For instance, I’m more than happy to split chores or whip up dinner together. I don’t believe any task is “men’s work” or “women’s work.” Rigid gender roles aren’t my thing at all.

**What I’m Looking For**

I’m looking for a childfree woman, around 22–28, who’s also building a life centred on health, happiness, and personal growth. If you’re passionate about something, your career, a hobby, or a dream – that’s fantastic. I’m drawn to women who are emotionally grounded and mature, who communicate openly and kindly. Kindness and intelligence are incredibly attractive to me, and a good sense of humour is a bonus. (Being able to laugh together at silly things and also engage in meaningful conversations is the dream!)

Being health-conscious is a plus, but you don’t have to be a gym rat like me (though high-five if you are!). It would be great if you take care of yourself, whether through yoga, dance, hiking, or simply balanced living. If you love road trips, exploring new places, or even just strolling through town discovering a new café, we’ll have a lot to share.

Importantly, you must want no children. just like me. That means you’re sure about a future that’s just two partners (and maybe pets) against the world, not babies. You believe life can be fulfilling with love, a career, friends, and adventure, and you have that little glow when thinking about all the freedom and opportunities a childfree life offers. I’d love it if you’re as excited about building a fun, meaningful life our way (sans kids) as I am.

I truly value loyalty, positivity, and curiosity in a partner. Let’s support each other, respect our individuality, and encourage personal growth. I’m not seeking a carbon copy of myself – our differences will offer us valuable lessons. However, it’s beneficial if we share core values and a similar outlook on life (and of course, our childfree stance!). Ultimately, I’m searching for the one – a true partner to share my life with. I’m committed to something serious and long-term (marriage is a possibility when the time feels right). Therefore, if you’re looking for a casual or superficial relationship, we might not be the best match.

**If You’re Interested…**

…then hi! 😊 I’d love to get to know you. Send me a DM and introduce yourself. You could share a few basic details like your age, city, childfree journey/stance, passions, and ideal weekend plans. The more you share, the better. It’ll help us quickly determine if we might be a great match. Feel free to ask me anything, too. I’m open and appreciate honesty and curiosity.

I’m excited about the possibility of finding that special teammate to share this freedom-filled life with. If you’ve read this far, thank you for your time – I already owe you a coffee or two! 😉

This chapter is also pretty long. Also this chapter implies that the whole Jade winglet lives in the same cave. I’ve decided to change it so the male and female dragonets live in separate caves.


Chapter 6, Bad Liar


Lexi sat with Quinn and Kaitlyn in the prey center, far enough from any dragonets so they couldn’t hear them. Lexi and Kaitlyn had been eating some fruit, while Quinn slurped on some raw fish. The two girls looked at him disgustingly, but looked around to see other dragons doing the same.


*I would never eat anything raw, except sushi and maybe steak tartare. Okay, I’ll sometimes eat raw meat.*


“These fruits are pretty good,” Kaitlyn commented, taking a bite out of a mango.


“Yeah! They’re way sweeter than the ones back on Penthara.” Lexi added.


“Oh, Aurora, what… have you been up to in school so far?” Quinn suddenly asked. It was kinda weird using different names in casual conversations, but they had to keep up their dragon facade while in public.


*Not taking any chances I guess.*


“Stopped a few arguments in the hallways.” Kaitlyn replied, “This one Seawing keeps arguing with every dragon coming his way. It’s annoying.”


“Makes sense.” Quinn muttered, “Dragonets do that.” Quinn chuckled but didn’t look up from his sketch pad under his talons. He was shading in what looked like a dragon’s wing. Lexi couldn’t tell whose wing it was, but the tension in his shoulders told her something was up.


“Are you ok, Quinn?” She asked.


Quinn hesitated, “I just found out what happened in Skipper’s combat training class.”


Lexi perked up. “Huh? What happened?” 


Quinn looked up. “He passed out. Skipper I mean. Tsunami said he hit his head hard on the ground but…” He looked around and dropped his voice before continuing.


Lexi sat up straighter. “So… he could’ve—?”


“Yeah.” Quinn tucked his sketch pad into his satchel and stood up. “I have to go teach art, but I want someone to check on him. Lexi, can you go really quickly?”


“Sure,” Lexi said, standing up. “I’ll make sure he’s still breathing and didn’t like, explode or something.”


“Thanks,” Quinn said with a blank expression on his face. “Let me know if anything happens.”


“Yeah,” Lexi said in agreement, then turned to Kaitlyn. “If I don't come back in ten minutes, I’m either unconscious or traumatically emotionally scarred.”


“I got you.” Kaitlyn chuckled.


“Thanks, Aurora.” Lexi looked around to see a bunch of dragonets talking amongst themselves. After peering a little harder, she was able to spot the Jade Winglet. Turtle was quietly eating a fish, and next to him was Kinkajou, who was taking down some fruit. Winter, however, wasn’t eating anything at all. He was just standing next to the table where the Jade winglet sat. The two remaining dragons, Moon and Qibli, were sharing a goat carcass, tails intertwined. 


*Huh. Probably a weird dragon way to show affection.*


“Alright, I should get going,” Quinn announced. 


“I’ll start leaving for Tommy, then,” Lexi responded.


“So… you guys are leaving me?”


“Yeah,” Quinn flatly stated, leaving the room.


“Oh, damn.” Kaitlyn said, “Guess I’ll have to go make some new REAL friends then.”


“Those dragonets scare me.” Lexi joked.


“Maybe I’ll talk to Qibli. I think he’s Tommy’s friend.”


“He’s already got a friend? That’s very unlikely.” Lexi and Kaitlyn both got a big laugh out of that one.


“But seriously, he was walking with him earlier today,” Kaitlyn explained. “I bumped into them while they were headed to class.”


“At least he won’t be turning emo! At least I think… Well, I should get going now.”


“Yeah, go check up on that kid. I’m gonna talk to the Jade winglet.”


“Yeah, good luck.” Lexi laughed, walking out of the prey center.


She made her way winding down the halls. They were quieter than usual, with most of the dragonets in the prey center or their cave. She passed a couple of young rainwings giggling about something, and two icewings bickering over some math problem. 


*Are all icewings so aggressive?!* After enough walking, she was getting the hang of having talons. Lexi stopped in front of the Jade winglet’s cave.


“Knock, knock,” she said, slipping inside without caring for a response.


Tommy was curled on his bed of moss and woven blankets with his face half buried in one of his wings. His breathing was steady but shallow, twitching slightly every few seconds, like he was in a dream.


“Jeez… what did they do to you?”


Tommy didn’t respond. Obviously. He was OUT, dead to the world,


Lexi sat down next to Tommy. She noticed the skyfire that he dropped earlier on a shelf next to his bed. Lexi carefully put the skyfire back under his wing. She had learned the name from Quinn, who told her the importance of always having it on. As he said, ‘We don’t need a dragonet blowing our identity.’ She exhaled a little, brushing a bit of moss away from his snout. “You don't know how to chill, huh?”


Lexi looked around the cave. Tommy’s space was the only one not decorated. Well, besides Winter’s who kept his bed neat and organized. Everything seemed so stiff, like he was trying to make little ice sculptures of everything. 


*Suits him well…*


Kinkajou’s space had a hammock hanging in between two stalagmites and colorful visuals plastered all over. Moon’s space was tucked away a little and dimly lit. She also kept scrolls stacked to the side. It had a very secluded and mysterious feel to it. Qibli’s space gave off an organized chaos vibe. He placed a bunch of scrolls, diagrams, and a history project from Webs on the wall. While at first glance, someone might call this messy, Lexi could see that it had its own charm to it, like her desk back home. While her eyes grazed over the bed, they quickly flicked back to do a double-take. Under his pillow, the tip of a dagger peeked out of the edge. It was small and lightweight, good for quick movements, Lexi noted.


*Very sneaky, Qibli.*


Turtle’s space was cluttered and kind of secretive. He had a couple of scrolls, as well as some random objects, such as a seemingly random wooden bowl.


*Uh, ok? Why does he have that? Does he bring food and eat it in there??*


Lexi turned back to Tommy, who was still curled up on his mossy bed. “Well, I should get going now.” Lexi stood up and was about to leave when Tommy’s wing twitched.


*Hmm?*


Tommy began muttering something.


“You…trying to tell me something?” Lexi leaned in closer.


“—s truth is written in silent ink,” Tommy muttered from his sleep, in a little deeper voice than normal.


“All ink is silent, goofball.”


*What does that mean, though?* Lexi pondered the thought for a few moments. *Ugh, I didn’t hear all of it. Damn. That sucks.*


“How about…you stop muttering weird phrases, and I’ll go tell Quill.” She said.


No response.


“Figured. I’m talking to a knocked-out dragon.” Lexi stepped out of the cave, only to be met with a certain, apparently knife-wielding, sandwing. “Oh, hey Qibli.”


“Hi. Didn’t expect you to see you coming out of our cave.” Subtle suspicion underlaid the innocent voice he projected.


“Just…” Lexi looked back at Tommy, “Just checking up on T- I mean, Skipper.”


“Oh, ok.” Qibli eyed her with more than just curiosity. 


“Anyways, I gotta go to art class with Quill.”


“See you later.” Qibli waved to her.


Lexi nodded and moved on, but her brain was still stuck on what Tommy said in his sleep. *Silent ink? What was he dreaming about?*


She walked through the hallways, which were now semi-filled with dragonets. Not as much as usual, but enough to hear Lexi if she continued musing under her breath


*So… I gotta tell Quinn about what Tommy said, and that I almost got caught by Qibli. Great. He’s gonna be thrilled! *


She made her way through the mountain and to the art cave. Peeking in, she saw that another winglet was already in there, Quinn introducing himself to the new dragonets. Noticing her hanging in the doorway, he signaled for her to walk in.


*Welp, here we go…*

 
~~7 Minutes ago~~


“Welp, here we go.” Kaitlyn stood up from her spot at the table where Lexi and Quinn were just at. With no more excuses, she rose onto her talons.


*Now I gotta go make some new friends. More Tommys to be friends with. Great.*


She scanned the room again, spotting the Jade winglet in their usual spot. They were half-eating and half-chatting to each other. Kinkajou was yapping in Turtle’s face, who looked like he was half-listening. Winter stood coldly next to the table with the rest of the winglet, looking unsure as to whether he was a part of the group. And Moon and Qibli were… weirdly close. Like tail touching close.


*Dragons are weird.*


Kaitlyn popped the last piece of her mango into her mouth, exhaled, then started walking over. She tried to look casual, but walking across a cave on all fours with a bunch of dragons looking on was not something she practiced.


Moon was the first to notice her presence, looking up from her goat carcass. “Oh—hi there.”


“Hey,” Kaitlyn said, “Mind if I join you guys for a sec? I think I ran into one of you earlier.”


“Oh yeah, that was me,” Qibli said, happier than ever. “I was with Skipper… you’re his friend, right?”


“Unfortunately.” Kaitlyn sat down at the edge of the table. “He’s…something.”


“Huh? How so?” Qibli asked.


“He’s way too hyper and immature.”


“Oh, he seemed normal earlier today,” Qibli responded.


*Good to know he’s behaving.*


“That’s good to hear.”


“Stop hogging her Qibli!” Kinkajou moved closer to Kaitlyn, shoving her talons in Qibil's face “I’m Kinkajou! That’s Turtle, Qibli, Moon, and Mister Snowflake over there is Winter!” 


Winter glared at her, but didn’t respond.


“Name’s Aurora,” Kaitlyn told them. “I’m the new hall monitor.”


“Aurora?” Winter perked up. “I’ve never heard of you before. Where are you from?”


*I wish I had studied more of my tribe*


“I’m… not from the ice kingdom.”


“So where’d you come from then?” Winter came up closer to Kaitlyn, as if he was interrogating her.


“I..uh..” Kaitlyn stuttered.


*Come on. Think. Quinn showed you a map of Pyrrhia earlier, remember?*


“I…came from a small village on the border of the ice and sky kingdom.” Kaitlyn lied.


“On the border?” Winter raised his voice to a level that was just below shouting, but louder than talking. “Who are your parents?”


Kaitlyn was now visibly uncomfortable with Winter’s demands. Qibli, noticing this, spoke up. “Winter, calm down.”


“What? It’s a general question.” Winter came closer to Kaitlyn’s face. She could feel ice crystals from his breath settling on her scales


“Winter…” Moon started, “Maybe ease up a little. She just got here.”


“I don’t know any icewing villages near the sky kingdom.” Ignoring everybody, Winter continued to press Kaitlyn even further.


“Uh… my Mom’s a skywing.” This sparked confusion from the group. “Oh… my dad's an icewing. Or was…before he…left.”


Winter narrowed his eyes but seemed to hesitate a little. A faint flicker of something spread across his face before disappearing. Pity? Doubt? Probably not.


“Half skywing…” he muttered, “explains a few things.”


Moon tilted her head, ignoring Winter. “You’re a hybrid?”


“Yeah…”


There was a short pause.


“Huh. I never met an icewing/skywing hybrid.” Qibli examined her.


Kaitlyn forced a smile. “Well, there’s a first time for everything…”


Kaitlyn was in fact not a hybrid. She wrote “icewing” on her paper, and that’s it. Not half skywing, or half nightwing, like what Quinn wrote. How was she going to keep this lie up? Well, it’s not like she had any parents to prove her tribe.


She shifted on the stone bench, trying not to look uncomfortable or awkward. The table had gone quiet a second too long.


Kinkajou then piped up, breaking the silence. “That’s cool!” She exclaimed. “You can like, fly fast and survive snowstorms!”



“Yeah, I guess I can.”


Kaitlyn thought about it for a second. *That’s true. I don’t really like being cold.* Being raised in a desert, Kaitlyn did not adapt to the cold. Coincidentally, choosing to be an icewing was probably one of the better choices.


Moon offered a small smile. “How is your time at the academy so far?”


“It’s… big,” she answered honestly, “I’m still figuring out the layout and names of all the students.”


“We can help you with that,” Qibli said, flashing a grin. “I basically have the whole school memorized. I used to sneak around the hallway back in my first year.” Qibli fake-whispered that last part to Kaitlyn.


“You’re saying that like you stopped,” Turtle muttered without looking up.


Qibli rolled his eyes. “Fine, I still do. But it’s for noble reasons, like helping lost hybrids.”


Kaitlyn almost laughed. Almost.


“Thanks,” she replied, “I might take you up on that.”


Winter finally sat down, with his wings slightly twitching on the sides of his body. Kaitlyn tried to ignore it.


Moon leaned in a bit. “If you need anything—directions, tips, dragons to avoid—you can always ask us.”


“That’s sweet,” Kaitlyn replied, surprised that she meant it too. Moon’s nice. I don’t understand why he’s so afraid of her. 


“And if anyone is giving you a hard time,” Qibli glanced at Winter, “Just let us know.”


“I can handle myself,” Kaitlyn responded a bit too quickly. “But…thanks.”


Though he was being friendly, Qibli’s constant prying eyes felt like they were trying to take her apart and see her secrets. He knew Kaitlyn was lying about something. Not sure what, he knew something was off about her.


She could see it in the way his eyes lingered a second too long. The way his questions were light, yet carefully placed. He wasn’t being rude; he was actually being quite nice, but he was being smart. 


Which meant she had to be smarter.


~~Back with Lexi~~


“So you’re telling me, that he’s muttering prophecies in his sleep?” Quinn looked like he’d been struck in the head with a scroll. “And Qibli’s now on to us. Fantastic.”


When Quinn spotted Lexi returning, he wrapped up his introduction, allowed the dragonets to start their painting, and slipped out of the cave without a word being spoken. Lexi followed Quinn as he rounded the corner, with her wings brushing along the cold stone walls, causing goosebumps to prick along her skin.


She never knew what to expect from Quinn. Some days he was all dry humor and sarcastic comments, and other times he had these weird mood swings like a rainwing with no fruits or sun time (Deathbringer had told them about these things). Talking to him felt like gambling in a casino—you never knew if you were gonna hit the jackpot or walk away completely regretting ever coming there.


Quinn rubbed his temples. “I swear,” he muttered, not looking at her, “if this dragonet ends up being some chosen-one nonsense, I’m retiring. I’ll vanish into the rainforest and let Tsunami find a new art teacher.”


Lexi blinked. “You’d last two days without a sketchbook or a cup of coffee.”


He finally glanced up at her, a flicker of a grin tugging at his snout. “Maybe. But at least the trees don’t mutter unnecessary prophecies.”


Lexi stared into Quinn’s eyes. His pupils were mainly red, with a unique purple ring that she hadn’t seen before. His eyes glistened in the small sunbeam that slid into the hallway. Lexi admired his eyes before Quinn struck her back into reality.


“You good?”


“I, uh…yeah.” 


“Uh… ok, sure.” Quinn turned back in the direction of the art cave. “Let’s head back.”


On their way back to the cave filled with curious dragonets, they were met with an older rainwing that neither of them had seen before. The rainwing had scales that shifted between a sunny yellow and leafy green. A satchel slung across his shoulder, and an amused expression on his face. 


Quinn spoke up first. “Hello, how may I help you?”


“Are you Quill?” The rainwing asked.


“Uh, yeah.” The hybrid responded.


“Perfect.” The rainwing perked up. “Name’s Pineapple, messenger for Queen Glory.”


Quinn tilted his head. “Messenger? I didn’t know rainwings did that.”


“Well, I guess I’m special.” Pineapple grinned, unclipping his satchel from his shoulder. “Her Majesty has a message for you.”


Pineapple pulled out a small rolled-up scroll, tied with a small string. “Said it was important.”


Quinn untied the string and scanned the scroll quickly. His eyes narrowed. “‘Requesting one member from your group… to assist with something.’” His snout wrinkled slightly. “That’s oddly vague…”


“Did she tell you what she needs us for?” Lexi asked.


Pineapple shrugged, scales turning an innocent yellow. “Nah not really. Just told me to give you the scroll, and guide whoever decides to go back to the rainforest.”


*Oh, that’s nice of him. I doubt any of us could find our way to the rainforest without getting lost. Think of all the bugs, and snakes, and animals, and-*


“Ugh.” Quinn loudly groaned, cutting off Lexi’s daydreams. “I kinda have a class to teach right now.”


“Y’know, I can go for you.” Lexi offered.


“Really? You’d… do that for me?”


“Of course! Besides, it should be refreshing! As long as there aren’t any mosquitoes, or beetles, or-“


“Great!” Pineapple loudly chirped over Lexi’s rambling, tossing his satchel back over his shoulder. “C’mon! Shouldn’t take more than an hour if we fly fast.”


*I don’t think I can do that yet, but alrighttt.*


“See you later Quill!”


“Bye.” He said, walking back into the art cave.


…


The journey to the Rainforest Kingdom was… well, surprisingly peaceful. Flying this trip a second time was a whole new experience. The sudden shift from the rocky mountains to endless green was almost overwhelming. Trees stretched out as far as she could see, broken only by flashes of rivers and the occasional bright-colored RainWing sunbathing in the canopy. Arriving in the rainforest, Pineapple led her through a gap in the trees that opened into a clearing with hammocks, fruit stands, and chatting dragons. Sitting comfortably on a raised platform at the center was Queen Glory, scales shimmering with a commanding blend of emerald and deep violet. The room had a whole different vibe from the throne room, way chillier, yet Glory still seemed to command power. 


*Wow, she’s pretty. I can understand why Deathbringer fell for her. Beautiful, yet deadly. *Lexi mused on the thought for a while. *That’s a fun way to be perceived!* Besides her, Pineapple slightly bowed towards the Queen and left the vicinity. 


Standing just beside Glory, half-shrouded by the shade of a massive tree, was a nightwing. It wasn’t Deathbringer however, instead, it was a female nightwing. She was tall, proper, and quiet, her dark scales flecked with tiny specks of silver, like stars scattered across a midnight sky. Her eyes were a sharp, piercing silver-blue—not cold, but observant.


She didn’t say anything, but Lexi caught her glancing their way as they landed.


“Tara, right?” Glory greeted, straight to the point. “Thanks for coming on such short notice.”


“No problem,” Lexi replied, brushing a stray leaf off her wing. Her gaze flicked back toward the NightWing, who remained quiet but watched them with mild curiosity, almost like she was listening without really trying.


Before Lexi could ask in her mind why the nightwing was there, Glory turned slightly, glancing back at the dragon. “And you. You’re still sure about applying for that teaching position?”


The NightWing gave a small, almost imperceptible nod. “I am. Jade Mountain could use someone with… my expertise.”


“Hmm.” Glory tapped her claws on the throne. “We’ll talk more after this.”


Lexi blinked. *Teaching position?*


She glanced at the NightWing again, but the dragon had already shifted her attention elsewhere, like she’d never been looking in the first place.


*Uh ok? I don’t think Jade Mountain needs another teacher, unless she wanted to teach rainwing dragonets or whatever.*


The female nightwing then quietly walked out of the room, leaving Lexi and Glory by themselves.


“So,” Glory continued, shifting her attention fully back to Lexi. “Let’s get to why I called you here.”


Lexi perked up, trying to act more professional. “Right. So… what exactly did you need from us?”


Glory let out a slow sigh, flicking her tail. “The potion Quill gave me. The healing one. It works—really well, but it’s useless if we can’t make more of them.”


Lexi nodded. “Yeah… the ingredients are, uh… not exactly on Pyrrhia.”


“Exactly,” Glory said. “Which is why I’m sending someone back with you to Penthara to collect more of the plants.”


“Oh, okay,” Lexi replied, then tilted her head. “Wait. Someone?”


“Yeah.” Glory’s eyes sparkled with a hint of mischief. “Deathbringer.”


“What?” A voice groaned from somewhere behind the throne.


Deathbringer then slouched into view, looking very much like someone who had been eavesdropping but didn’t expect to get called out. “Really, Glory? Me?”


“Yes, you,” Glory said without looking at him. “You’ve been pacing around the kingdom all week like you’re bored out of your mind. Go do something useful.”


“I was not pacing—”


“Deathbringer.”


He sighed dramatically, flaring his wings. “Fine. But if I get eaten by some weird scavenger monster, I’m blaming you.”


Lexi snorted. “You’ll be fine. Trust me. If anyone’s getting eaten by a ‘scavenger monster’, it’s usually Tommy.”


“Sounds promising,” Deathbringer deadpanned.


Glory ignored them, already scribbling something down on a scroll. “You two leave as soon as you’re ready. Bring back enough for a full supply of the potion. And maybe… a few extras.” She glanced toward the doorway that led out of the room. “Depending on how things go… we might have more use for it than I predicted.”


Lexi caught a glance from the nightwing and frowned slightly, but didn’t comment.


Deathbringer groaned again, but this time with less resistance. “Alright, alright. Penthara adventure. Should be fun. Probably.”


“Let’s go, Deathbringer.” Lexi flared her wings, already turning toward the edge of the clearing. “Before Glory changes her mind and sends someone even more annoying.”


Deathbringer snorted. “Hard to imagine someone more annoying than me.”


“Oh, don’t tempt fate,” Lexi snorted cheerily, “The world has its range.”


The two took off, weaving through the Rainforest’s dense canopy until they reached the clearing where the portal shimmered quietly in the air—still cracked slightly at the edges, like glass that had been mended, but not perfectly.


Deathbringer eyed it warily. “You sure this thing’s not gonna explode one day?”


“Oh, definitely,” Lexi said without missing a beat. “But probably not today. I think.”


“Comforting,” he grumbled.


Deathbringer walked up to the mysterious structure and placed his talons on the engravings. The two dragons looked away, as the portal shined a bright light, activating it.


Before Lexi stepped through, she took off her pendant, her dragon form shimmered with a pulse of magic before shrinking down, limbs shifting, wings dissolving, scales fading away until she stood on two legs again—human. She then took a step through the portal, with her boots hitting the familiar grass of Penthara.


The moment they stepped through the portal, Lexi blinked against the sudden shift in atmosphere—the crisp air of the rainforest swapped for Penthara’s cool breeze and gray skies.


She adjusted the strap of her hoodie, tugged it over her head, and brushed a few leaves out of her hair. She went to take another step and immediately face planted. “Ugh, I forgot how being a human was.” Spitting grass out of her mouth she tried to use her wings to send herself back to her feet. Of course, relying on muscle memory if nonexistent muscles don’t work exactly. She ate more grass. 


“Soo, do all scavengers like eating grass?” Deathbringer laughed.


“Oh shut up!” Lexi retorted, though she was laughing too.


“Alright,” she glanced back at Deathbringer, who was very much still a dragon. “You… yeah. You need to get off the ground. Like, now. Or else some scary scavenger will come through here and mangle you!”


“Wait really?”


“Wow you are gullible aren’t you?”


“No, I’m not!”


“Mhmmm. Whatever you say, oh great Deathbringer! Scared of nonexistent scavengers!” 


Deathbringer rolled his eyes. “Alright alright chillax before I have to bring death on you.” He eyed the unfamiliar human huts and buildings with a skeptical look. “I just am not a fan of this place.”


“Yeah, well, it’s mutual,” Lexi muttered, glancing around. “Up. Clouds. Please.”


“Fine, fine,” he sighed, flaring his wings. “Staying above the clouds… sounds boring.”


“Yeah, but not getting caught is less boring than it sounds.”


With a dramatic groan, Deathbringer launched into the sky, his dark scales quickly fading into the low-hanging clouds above.


Lexi shoved her hands into her pockets, turned down a familiar dirt path, and started toward where the plants usually grew west of Lexi’s house. Halfway there—


“Hey—hey! Hold up.”


Lexi flinched. *Oh no. No no no.*


She sighed, turning on her heels to see Derek crossing the street toward her, hands jammed into his jacket pockets, sharp smirk already locked in place.


“You’ve gotta be kidding me,” Lexi groaned under her breath.


“Well, well, well,” Derek drawled, stopping in front of her. “Didn’t expect you to show up back here. Where’s the rest of your disaster crew?”


Lexi shoved her hands deeper into her pockets. “Busy. Doing things that don’t involve you.”


Derek cocked a brow. “Mmhm. Funny. Because I’ve been wondering… where’s Tommy? And Kaitlyn? Haven’t seen either of them in days.”


Her jaw tightened. “I wouldn’t know.”


“Uh-huh.” His eyes scanned her face. “You’re a bad liar.”


“Not lying. Just not knowing the truth.”


“Cute.” His smirk sharpened. “See, the thing is… when my employees suddenly drop off the map, I tend to get curious. And when that employee happens to be someone like Tommy? Well… I get concerned.”


Lexi scoffed. “Oh, please. You don’t do ‘concerned.’”


“Yeah, you’re right.” He took a step closer, voice dropping lower. “What I do… is make sure people remember who they owe.” Derek reached for Lexi’s arm before she pulled back.


“You seriously think threatening me is gonna work?” Lexi curled her fingers into fists in her pockets. “I told you. I don’t know where they went.”


“Not a threat,” Derek ignored her last statement. “Just… a reminder. Pass it along. If Tommy and Kaitlyn think they can just disappear, it’s not gonna go well for them.”


Her glare sharpened. “You know what? Why don’t you go bother someone else? I’m busy.”


She stepped past him with her shoulders stiff, ignoring the way his smirk lingered behind her like a bad smell.


“Tell them,” Derek called lazily after her, “that they can’t run forever.”


Lexi cursed him under her breath. “I can see why they don’t like you.” She whispered to herself.


Lexi shoved her hands deeper into her pockets, quickening her pace down the dirt path. The further she got from town, the more the tension in her shoulders eased. Derek’s voice still echoed in her head, but at least out here, it was… a little quieter.


The familiar tree line came into view—a patch of overgrown grass and dense shrubs, speckled with purple flowers and spindly green stems.


Lexi stopped, glanced up at the sky, and made a quick motion with her fingers—tracing an invisible circle in the air, then flicking her wrist twice, signaling to Deathbringer that it was safe to come back down.


A shadow rippled in the clouds above. Moments later, Deathbringer descended, wings tucked close as he landed with a heavy thud, shaking the grass.


“You took your time,” he grumbled, glancing around. “Is this the spot?”


“Yep. Welcome to the magic weed patch,” Lexi joked, crouching to start looking through the plants. “Help me look for the ones with the silver leaves and blue stems. We need at least four bundles.”


Deathbringer frowned at the plants like they offended him. “You’re lucky I’m too invested in surviving this trip to complain.”


“Yeah, yeah. Put that energy into searching.” She shoved some grass aside, squinting. “Also, try not to step on anything valuable. Or illegal.”


“Define illegal,” Deathbringer muttered, nosing a patch of weeds aside.


“Oh, you’d know if you touched it. It’s the one that stabs you.”


Deathbringer froze. “You’re joking.”


“Mm… mostly.”


He shot her a flat look but went back to searching, more carefully this time.


Lexi found the first bundle tucked between two rocks, yanking it free and stuffing it into the satchel slung across her back. “That's one.”


Deathbringer searched through another patch. “This one?”


“Yep, grab it.”


With a careful flick of his claws, he tugged it free and passed it over. “We need two more.”


As they worked, the wind shifted, carrying a sound that made Lexi’s skin freeze. Footsteps. Not animals. Not random. It was another human.


She perked up, eyes scanning the treeline. “Did you hear that?”


Deathbringer’s head snapped up, eyes narrowing. “Yeah. Someone’s close.”


Lexi shoved the last bundle into her bag and stood. “That’s enough. Up. Now.”


“On it.” Deathbringer spread his wings. “You?”


“I’ll meet you at the portal. Go.”


“Don’t get caught,” he warned, then launched into the sky, vanishing into the clouds again.


Lexi quickly, but quietly ran out of the patch of plants and grass, and started running back to where she came from. Looking back up, Lexi could faintly see Deathbringer’s outline in the clouds as he soared through the sky, towards their meet-up spot.


She sped up her pace as the sun set and the three moons started peeking over the horizon. Carrying the flowers, Lexi finally made it to the portal.


“Did you get followed?” The nightwing asked from behind the portal.


“No…at least I don’t think so.” Lexi shoved the bundles of flowers toward the nightwing. “Here. Take these. Let’s go before someone actually spots us.”


“You’re so demanding.” Deathbringer grabbed the plants out of Lexi’s human hands.


“Well, you should be used to it by now,” Lexi replied. “Now open the portal thing.”


…


After they went back through the portal, Lexi put her pendant back on, transforming her back into “Tara.” Deathbringer led Lexi down the mossy path toward the RainWing palace. Vibrant flowers and hanging vines swayed gently in the breeze as they approached the entrance. The smell had a nice calming vibe to it.


Inside, the palace was as lively as ever. RainWings lounged in hammocks, chattered in soft voices, or practiced color-shifting games. Somewhere in the back, a group of dragonets was giggling to each other.


“Where’s Glory?” Lexi asked, glancing around.


Deathbringer flicked his tail. “Probably—”


“—Busy,” a voice cut in.


Both of them turned to see Glory stepping out from the main hall, looking mildly annoyed and stressed at the same time. “I’m in the middle of arguing with the teachers’ council about the whole ‘NightWing teaching at Jade Mountain’ thing. Not pretty.”


“Shocker,” Deathbringer deadpanned.


Glory sighed. “If you’re back with the plants, just take them to Mastermind. He’s down in the lab. Left hallway, third door.”


“Oh good,” Lexi muttered. “A science gremlin. My favorite.”


“You’ll survive,” Glory replied dryly, turning back toward the main hall.


*I already have Quill for that…*


Deathbringer gave a lazy salute with his wing and started down the hallway. “Come on. The sooner we do this, the sooner we can leave.”


Lexi followed, walking past several curious RainWings, one of whom was hanging upside down from a vine hammock and staring at her like she was the most interesting thing happening today.


Reaching the lab door, Deathbringer knocked once before pushing it open. The scent of herbs, potions, and something faintly like burned mango filled the air.


Inside, Mastermind was hunched over a table stacked with glass jars and glowing liquids, muttering something about “compound structures” and “leaf enzymes.”


“Oh good,” Mastermind chirped without looking up. “The specimens. Set them down, set them down.”


Lexi dropped the bundle of flowers onto the nearest clear surface. “Careful. It was a nightmare getting these.”


“Fascinating,” Mastermind mumbled, already picking through the leaves. “These cellular structures are remarkable...”


“Yeah, yeah. Cool plant magic. You’ve got them now.” Deathbringer turned toward the door. “We’re done here.”


“Excellent. I’ll start brewing the potion immediately,” Mastermind said, barely paying attention. “Tell Queen Glory I’ll send it up as soon as it’s ready.”


Deathbringer was already halfway back into the hallway. “She’s busy,” he called over his shoulder.


Lexi sighed, following him out. “Can we go now?”


“Absolutely,” Deathbringer said. “If we don’t, I might accidentally throw someone off a balcony.” 


*Uh, is that something you do often?*


Arriving back on the royal platform, Glory was sitting down, talking to a rainwing nearby.


“Are you still busy?” Deathbringer asked.


“No…I dealt with it.” Glory sighed, “Tara, I’m going to have Nightweaver fly with you back to Jade Mountain.”


The same female nightwing Lexi saw Glory talking to earlier, suddenly walked out from the shadows, and began to introduce herself.


“Hey! Tara, right?” The nightwing chirped. “I’m Nightweaver.”


“Uh, yeah.”


“You guys should get going before it gets darker.” Glory said, standing up and flicking her tail. “I’ve got enough chaos to deal with without you two. Deathbringer go help them navigate back.”


“Huh?” Deathbringer groaned. “They can make it there by themselves.”


“It’s also getting dark and I don’t need them getting themselves hurt. Especially Tara.” 


*I can take care of myself, Glory. But, I guess it’s nice of her to make sure we’re safe.*


“Fine…”


“Thanks, Deathy~”


“Uh..what.” Deathbringer blushed.


“Alright hurry up and get out of here.” Glory commanded. “See you back soon.”


The three of them then walked out of the place, and launched themselves into the air, disappearing into the evening sky.

1mmcyrz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hot_Romance_Stories/comments/1mmcyrz/his_regret_my_throne/,"His Regret, My Throne","Right before our Mating Ceremony, my mate, Alpha Damien, told me he had to temporarily mark an Omega from our pack, Seraphina.

He claimed she had the Moon Sickness and would die if he didn't mark her.

I fought him on it, but the next day, he moved Seraphina right into the penthouse of the Pack House.

The suite meant for the future Luna.

My suite.

To calm me, he even got on his knees, his eyes red as he promised, ""Once she's safe, I'll remove the mark. You'll still be my only Luna.""

But then, Seraphina found me, a medical report in her hand.

Six weeks pregnant.

They'd already held their marking ceremony long before Damien ever came to me.

My heart shattered into ash.

My pen dug into the calendar, carving a vicious X over the date that was supposed to be our Mating Ceremony.

Then, I opened my laptop and replied to the email from the European Laurel Healers' Guild.

""I accept your invitation. I leave on the day of the Mating Ceremony.""

Chapter 1

Right before our Mating Ceremony, my mate, Damien, said he needed to mark another she-wolf, Omega Seraphina—the one who’d supposedly saved his life.

""I have to give Seraphina a temporary mark. She's dying, Isla. The Moon Sickness is eating her alive.""

Damien’s gaze was heavy on me.

I stopped mixing the moon petal elixir in my hands.

It was for our Mating Ceremony, said to make the mate bond even stronger.

And now, he wanted me to accept him marking another woman.

My fingertips started to tremble.

""Are you fucking kidding me?""

""It's the only way to save her."" Damien turned away, unable to meet my eyes.

Those deep blue eyes I once loved were now a storm of conflict and chilling resolve.

""I owe her my life.""

""I don't care what you owe her!"" My voice went sharp. ""A mark is sacred, Damien! It's supposed to be for us—""

""One month,"" he cut me off, his eyes bloodshot, a flicker of confusion in them as if he genuinely couldn't understand my resistance.

""I promise, I'll remove the mark right after the ceremony. She'll live, and you'll still be my only Luna.""

I stared at him, my jaw tight. ""I don't agree. Unless you want to cut our mate bond.""

Damien's eyes finally turned to ice. ""This isn't a request, Isla. A life is at stake. Don't make me force this.""

He promised, ""It’s just a temporary mark. It won’t affect our bond. In a month, everything will be back to normal.""

Then he stormed out, slamming the door.

His Alpha scent, thick with anger, clung to the air long after he was gone.

The next day, I was standing at the entrance to the Pack Headquarters when a long, black sedan pulled up.

My whole body went numb.

Damien got out of the passenger seat and gently helped a delicate, fragile figure out of the car.

Seraphina.

She looked so pale, like a strong gust of wind could knock her over.

Damien's arm was wrapped around her waist, a protective gesture that sent a wave of nausea through me.

""Watch the steps,"" he said, his voice so gentle it made me want to scream.

It was a tone he had never once used with me.

I watched them walk into the building and get on the elevator.

Headed straight for the top floor.

For the luxury suite reserved only for the future Luna.

My suite.

Three hours later, Damien came back to our apartment.

I was waiting for him on the sofa, a cup of cold tea clutched in my hand.

""Is she settled in?"" My voice was so calm it scared me.

Damien took off his jacket. ""The pack healer said she needs a quiet environment.""

""So you put her on the top floor.""

""It has the best facilities,"" he said, avoiding my eyes. ""It's just temporary.""

I stood up and slowly walked toward him.

""Damien, where were you last night?""

He froze for a second. ""Dealing with a border dispute. I told you.""

""All night?""

""It was more complicated than I expected.""

I stepped closer, close enough to smell the scent of another she-wolf on him.

The commingled scent was a poisoned needle, stabbing straight through our mate bond.

A sharp, tearing pain ripped through my soul, and I almost buckled.

It wasn't just Seraphina’s scent. It was deeper, more intimate.

The kind of deeply blended scent that only comes from a true Mating mark.

He had lied.

He wasn't dealing with a border dispute last night.

He was performing their marking ceremony.

And now, he was still trying to get my permission for something that was already done.

""Do you even still need my permission?"" I took a step back, fighting the tears welling in my eyes.

""You have to understand, Isla. A life is at stake."" Damien moved toward me, trying to take my hand.

""You're my fated mate,"" he insisted, as if that explained everything. ""You should be on my side.""

I yanked my hand away. ""I need more time.""

""There is no time. She won't last much longer.""

Just then, the elevator to the penthouse opened.

Seraphina stepped out, draped in a white silk robe I'd never seen before.

Her cheeks were flushed with a sickly pink, but her eyes were bright.

She walked straight to Damien and leaned against his chest.

""Thank you, Damien,"" she said, her voice weak but sweet, her eyes fixed directly on me.

""I feel so much better already.""

Chapter2

I didn't sleep all night.

After Seraphina retreated to the penthouse, Damien followed her up.

""She needs someone to look after her,"" was the only explanation he gave.

I sat in our empty apartment, the memory of that mark—its scent—replaying over and over in my mind.

The tear in our bond throbbed, a constant, agonizing reminder.

Then it hit me.

Three weeks ago.

That night.

Damien had said he was going to handle a border dispute and didn't come back until the next morning.

That night, I lay in bed, fighting back waves of searing pain that tore through our bond.

I thought something was wrong with me, or that Damien had been hurt in the conflict.

I only breathed a sigh of relief when he finally returned.

His clothes had the faint scent of laurel leaves on them.

The sacred incense burned only during a Mating Rite.

I'd even asked him, ""Did you go to the Sacred Grove?""

He'd said, ""Just passing by.""

It never even crossed my mind that he would betray me. Betray our fate.

Now I understood.

He had already marked Seraphina that night.

And I, like a fool, had been sitting here worrying about his safety.

At dawn, my phone buzzed.

An encrypted email.

From: The Laurel Healers' Guild.

""Dear Miss Isla, we formally invite you to participate in our research initiative on Ancient Life Energies. This is the highest honor for a healer and the perfect place for your talents. Should you be interested, we hope for a response within the week.""

I stared at the screen.

This was the opportunity I had dreamed of my entire life.

It was also my only way out.

Damien walked in just as I was packing my things.

""What are you doing?""

""Packing my herbs,"" I said without looking up. ""Since the penthouse has a new occupant, I don't want to be in the way.""

""Isla, listen to me—""

""There's nothing to say."" I stood up and looked him dead in the eye. ""The Mating Ceremony,"" I stated, my voice dangerously calm, ""is off.""

The color drained from Damien's face.

""You can't do that.""

""I can,"" I said, turning back to my packing. ""I refuse to mate with an Alpha who has already marked someone else.""

""I told you, it's temporary!"" he yelled, grabbing my arm. ""I'll remove the mark in a month!""

""And then what?"" I shook him off. ""You think I'll ever trust you again?""

Pain flashed in Damien's eyes. ""She's dying, Isla. I can't just stand by and watch her die.""

""Why?"" I demanded. ""Because you owe her? Owe her for what?""

Damien fell silent, his lips pressed into a thin line.

""If you won't tell me, then we have nothing to talk about."" I walked toward the door.

""Wait!"" Damien scrambled after me, his powerful frame dropping to one knee before me. ""I promise you, in one month, I will give you the grandest ceremony this continent has ever seen. Every pack in North America will be there to witness it.""

I looked down at him, kneeling.

It wasn't pity I felt, but a bitter sense of absurdity and injustice.

Were our five years together, our fated bond, really going to end over a lie?

Was I really going to give up this easily?

In that moment of hesitation, the elevator doors opened.

Seraphina stepped out.

Seeing Damien on his knees, a fleeting, triumphant smirk touched her lips.

She walked right up to me and deliberately handed me a file folder.

""Isla,"" she said, her voice soft. ""I know you're a healer, too. This is my medical report. Could you take a look? Damien's Alpha energy is so powerful. I've been recovering so well since the marking, but... there's been an unexpected side effect. I'm a little scared.""

I took the report, my eyes scanning the data.

As a top-tier healer, I spotted the discrepancy immediately.

Six weeks pregnant.

But Damien had only completed the marking less than three weeks ago.

The dates didn't add up.

I looked up, my gaze cold, and handed the report to Damien.

""Congratulations,"" I said, my voice dripping with ice. ""It seems this 'side effect' began long before the 'temporary mark'.""

Then, without a second glance at his shocked and questioning face, I walked back into my room.

I looked at the calendar, at the bright red circle around our Mating Ceremony date.

It was now my departure date.

The countdown: thirteen days.

I opened my laptop and clicked reply.

""I accept your invitation. ""

Chapter3

That night, Damien didn't come back to our apartment.

I knew where he was.

The next morning, I opened the pack's secure network.

The top post was a new update.

Alpha Damien had ordered a hundred thousand dollars' worth of rare supplements for Seraphina.

Blood Ginseng, Moonlight Fungus, and Starfruit—things only needed during a werewolf pregnancy.

The comments section exploded.

""Is our Alpha going to be a father?""

""But isn't Isla his Luna?""

""I heard that Seraphina girl moved into the penthouse.""

""Isn't the Mating Ceremony next week?""

I shut my phone off.

At noon, I met my best friend, Chloe.

""You what?"" Chloe's voice was so sharp it nearly shattered her coffee cup. ""You're calling off the ceremony?""

""That's right.""

""Are you insane? He's your fated mate!""

""Fated mates don't mark other women right before their ceremony,"" I said, calmly sipping my coffee. ""And they certainly don't get another she-wolf pregnant with their pup.""

Chloe gasped. ""A pup?""

I showed her the photo of the lab report on my phone.

""That scheming bitch!"" Chloe slammed her hand on the table. ""She played you!""

""Probably,"" I shrugged. ""But it doesn't matter anymore.""

""Isla, you can't just give up. Damien loves you.""

""Loves me?"" I gave a bitter laugh. ""Does someone who loves you mark another woman behind your back?""

Chloe fell silent.

""I've already accepted the invitation from the European Healers' Guild,"" I said, standing up. ""I'm leaving tomorrow.""

""So soon?""

""If I stay any longer, I'm afraid I'll do something I regret.""

At eleven that night, I got back to the apartment building after an herb exchange.

The gathering was a success.

I’d met several healers from Europe, including a few Alphas I’d never seen before.

When the elevator doors opened, Damien was standing there.

His eyes were cold, his nostrils flaring slightly. ""Where were you?""

""An herb exchange.""

""With who?"" he pressed.

""Some colleagues.""

Damien stalked towards me, like a predator closing in on its prey. ""Don't lie to me. I smell another male's scent on you. An Alpha's.""

""So what if you do?""

A dangerous light flashed in his eyes. ""Get away from me, and wash that scent off you.""

""You don't get to order me around.""

""I'm your fated mate!""

""No, you're not,"" I said, pushing past him. ""You're Seraphina's.""

I walked towards our apartment, Damien following close behind.

But instead of arguing, he went straight to the armchair by the fireplace, sat down, and closed his eyes.

I knew what he was doing.

The mind-link.

His expression softened, and I could feel the murmur of his thoughts through our strained bond.

The pup is going to be so strong, so healthy.

The pup.

He was already looking forward to it.

I turned to go to my room.

""Isla.""

His voice stopped me.

""There's something about the ceremony I need to talk to you about.""

Chapter4

I stopped and turned, my face a cold mask. ""What is it now?""

""It's about the Rite of the Moon Spring."" He opened his eyes, and those deep blue pools held an undeniable command. ""I need to postpone it.""

""Why."" It wasn't a question.

""Seraphina's pregnancy is unstable. The healer said the pure energy of the Moon Spring would be good for her. So...""

He paused, as if searching for the right words. ""I've decided it's better if she has it.""

Let her have it.

He said it so casually, as if he were just rescheduling a meeting.

That was the highest honor for a Luna, to receive the pack's blessing.

It was the sacred moment we had dreamed of together.

My heart was numb.

I couldn't even feel the pain anymore.

I answered in the calmest voice I could manage. ""Fine.""

My calmness seemed to unnerve him. ""You... don't have anything else to say?""

""No.""

""...Good."" A flicker of relief crossed his face, as if he'd expected a bigger fight.

He then continued, his tone all business. ""I'm taking Seraphina to a private retreat in the Rockies. Handle the ceremony preparations. Don't bother me with the details unless the world is ending.""

He cut the link.

I walked out to the balcony.

It used to be my herb garden, filled with rare plants I'd cultivated for the future of our pack.

I had imagined using these herbs to heal our people, to protect our home.

Damien had never set foot out here.

He said he wasn't interested in ""all these flowers and weeds.""

Now, they had lost their meaning, too.

I started working, one by one, uprooting the plants I had so carefully nurtured, the sharp snap of roots and the damp scent of earth filling the air.

It was a funeral for a future that was now dead and buried.

Each one represented a betrayed hope.

When the last Stardust Bloom was in its box, I took out my phone and opened the calendar.

On the date I had marked countless times for the ""Rite of the Moon Spring,"" I drew a heavy, red X.

The countdown: twelve days.

Chapter5

Over the next week, my phone was flooded with notifications.

Seraphina's social media was on fire.

A picture of her lying in a bed at a luxury resort in the Rockies, Damien sitting beside her, peeling an apple.

Her in a hot spring, with Damien on the edge, holding a towel ready for her.

Her during a prenatal check-up, Damien holding her hand tightly.

Every photo had the same caption: ""Thank you, Damien, for taking such good care of me. I've never felt so safe.""

I didn't need to read the comments.

""The Alpha is so good to her.""

""Now that's what true love looks like.""

""What about Luna Isla? We never see her.""

""I heard she's busy with her career.""

I turned off my phone and went back to packing.

On the third day, I drove to my parents' house.

""Isla?"" My mother opened the door, surprised. ""What are you doing here?""

""I need to talk to you both.""

In the living room, my father put down his newspaper and looked at me.

""What is it?""

""I'm going to Europe.""

""For a vacation?""

""For work. The Laurel Healers' Guild invited me to join a research project."" I took a deep breath. ""I might be gone for a long time.""

My mother's face fell. ""What about your ceremony?""

""It's been postponed.""

""Postponed?"" My father frowned. ""Why?""

""Damien has some things to take care of,"" I said, trying to sound calm. ""We thought it would be better to hold it later.""

My parents exchanged a look.

""Isla, don't lie to us,"" my mother said, her voice gentle but firm as she took my hand. ""We're your parents. We can see the pain in your eyes. Tell us what he did.""

I closed my eyes. ""It's nothing, Mom. I just want to learn more while I'm young.""

""Does Damien agree with this?""

""He's very supportive of my career.""

Another lie.

My father was silent for a long time before finally nodding. ""If it's for your career, we support you.""

""But you have to stay in touch,"" my mother said, her eyes glistening with tears. ""And take care of yourself.""

After leaving my parents' house, I texted Chloe.

""Can you come help me pack?""

An hour later, Chloe was at my apartment door.

""My god, what happened here?"" she asked, staring at the empty living room.

""I'm moving.""

""Moving where?""

""Switzerland.""

Chloe sat on the couch and studied my face. ""Okay. Now tell me the truth. What the hell happened?""

I told her everything.

From Damien demanding to mark Seraphina, to the pregnancy report, to the canceled Rite of the Moon Spring.

When I finished, the living room was dead silent.

Chloe's face grew darker and darker.

""That bastard!"" she suddenly exploded. ""How could he do this to you?""

""He had his reasons.""

""What reasons? Life debt?"" Chloe stood up and started pacing. ""Even if he owed her his life, he has no right to trample all over you like this!""

""Chloe—""

""No, I won't accept this!"" She spun to face me, her eyes burning. ""Five years ago, on the Blood Moon, you nearly tore your soul in half to save him from a rogue attack! And now he has the audacity to remember only her so-called 'kindness'?""

I looked away, saying nothing.

Chapter6

Five days until the ceremony.

I walked into the Pack Council chamber, dressed in a black power suit.

All the Elders were waiting for me.

""Isla, are you certain about this?"" the Head Elder asked, his voice grave.

""I am."" I placed the formal request on the table. ""I am petitioning to suspend the Mating Ceremony.""

The chamber fell silent.

""Why?"" the Second Elder asked.

""Personal reasons.""

""Personal reasons?"" the Third Elder stood up. ""This is about an alliance between two powerful families!""

""That's your concern,"" I said, turning to leave. ""My decision is final.""

Furious discussion erupted behind me, but I didn't look back.

When I got back to the apartment building, I saw the familiar black sedan.

They were back.

The elevator doors opened, and Damien and Seraphina were standing inside.

Seraphina looked well, a healthy flush on her cheeks.

Damien's arm was still wrapped protectively around her waist.

""Isla?"" Damien's eyes widened in surprise when he saw me. ""Where have you been?""

""Taking care of some business.""

We rode up together in a tense, suffocating silence.

""You cleared out the herb garden?"" Damien asked as he pushed open our apartment door and saw the empty balcony.

""Gave it away.""

""Why?""

""I don't need it anymore.""

Damien frowned but didn't press further.

Seraphina walked onto the balcony, feigning surprise. ""Wow, it's so empty. I bet it was beautiful before.""

""It was fine.""

""Isla, I'm so grateful for your understanding,"" Seraphina said, turning to me, a strange light in her eyes.

""Why don't we all have dinner together tonight? I'd love to thank you properly.""

I just stared at her.

Seeing my coldness, Seraphina's expression immediately changed, her eyes welling up with tears.

""Did... did I say something wrong?"" She turned to Damien, her voice trembling. ""I just wanted to show my gratitude...""

Damien's face instantly darkened.

""Isla,"" he growled, his voice laced with the Alpha command. ""Control yourself. Seraphina is our guest. You are making her uncomfortable.""

I looked at him calmly. ""Fine.""

At dinner, the nutrient broth arrived.

Damien had ordered it specially for Seraphina.

I recognized the scent immediately: Heart-leaf, an herb whose properties only activate for a she-wolf bonded to the Alpha who serves it.

He served a bowl and handed it to me. ""You should have some too. It's good for you.""

I took the bowl and sipped.

A foreign, repulsive energy instantly warred with my own.

My body recoiled, the rejection a physical, agonizing proof of his betrayal.

Damien froze.

He had forgotten.

That herb no longer worked for me.

My phone rang.

Ignoring Damien, I stepped out onto the balcony, sliding the glass door shut behind me before answering in a hushed voice.

""Miss Isla? This is the secretary from the Laurel Guild. Your flight has been confirmed.""

""Good,"" I said, my voice steady despite the turmoil inside me. ""The ceremony is off. I'm ready to leave.""

Just as I hung up, a deep, commanding voice came from behind me.

""Who's leaving?""

Chapter7

I spun around. Damien was standing just outside the balcony door, his eyes like chips of ice.

The lingering pain from the energy clash had made me forget—an Alpha’s hearing could cut straight through walls.

Thank the Goddess, he hadn’t heard everything.

""A healer friend of mine,"" I answered calmly , stepping past him and back into the dining room. ""She's going to South America to study new herbs.""

Damien walked over and sat back down. ""Which friend?""

""You don't know her.""

""Her name.""

""Why should I tell you?""

Seraphina coughed softly from the side. ""Damien, don't be so hard on Isla. A girl's secrets are important.""

Her words seemed to calm him down.

""Sorry,"" he said to me, though his eyes were still full of suspicion.

But he didn’t press further, seeming reluctant to sour the mood any more.

His gaze softened as he turned to Seraphina, pulling a beautiful box from his jacket.

""What's that?"" Seraphina asked curiously.

""It's for you.""

Inside was an obsidian pendant, carved with intricate runes.

I could read them clearly: Damien & Seraphina, Forever Bonded.

""It's gorgeous!"" Seraphina exclaimed, putting it on. ""Is this a mate's token?""

""Mmmhmm."" Damien fastened the chain for her. ""I've infused it with my Alpha energy. It will protect you and the pup.""

He took out his phone and snapped a picture of her in the mirror.

""Smile.""

She beamed like a child, her eyes shining with pure happiness.

Damien immediately sent her the photo with the caption: My precious one.

""It suits you,"" I commented.

Damien looked at me, a flicker of distance in his eyes.

The next afternoon, I went to the werewolf-exclusive apothecary to buy some last-minute travel supplies.

As I reached the door, I heard a familiar voice inside.

""Check the heartbeat again.""

It was Damien.

Through the glass, I could see Seraphina lying on a treatment bed, with Damien standing nervously beside her.

""Everything's normal,"" the pack healer said. ""The pup is very healthy.""

""Thank you,"" Damien said, taking Seraphina's hand. ""The healer says the pup will be very strong.""

I turned to leave, but the chime of the door gave me away.

""Isla?"" Seraphina called out from inside. ""Are you here for herbs too?""

""Just passing by.""

""Wait, we can leave together,"" she called back to Damien. ""I'll be right out.""

Ten minutes later, they came out together.

""How are the ceremony preparations going?"" Seraphina asked innocently. ""I hear it's going to be huge.""

""The ceremony will proceed as planned,"" Damien answered for me. ""It's just been delayed a bit.""

I looked at them and said nothing.

""Isla, I know you must be feeling hurt,"" Seraphina said, stepping closer to me. ""But I hope you don't give up on Damien. You're the one he truly loves.""

Her voice was sincere, her eyes brimming with tears.

""I don't deserve such a good man. You're his fated mate.""

Onlookers on the street started to whisper.

""That girl is so kind.""

""She's willing to suffer for someone else's happiness.""

""Why does that Isla woman look so cold?""

I turned and walked away.

""Isla!"" Seraphina called after me. ""Please don't misunderstand, I really don't want to take him from you!""

She ran up, trying to grab my arm.

""I know you're angry, but please, just give us a chance to explain—""

""Let go of me,"" I said, shaking her off.

The moment my hand made contact, she didn't just stumble.

She threw herself sideways with a theatrical gasp, aiming directly for the ancient laurel tree.

Laurel trees have a repulsive energy to weaker werewolves; she should have known that.

""Ah!"" she screamed, slamming hard against the trunk before collapsing to the ground in a heap.

""Seraphina!"" Damien roared, rushing to her side.

He saw her on the ground, then looked at my outstretched hand, and his eyes blazed with a fury I had never seen directed at me.

""What the hell did you do?!"" he roared, dropping to his knees beside her. ""How could you attack a pregnant she-wolf?!""

""I didn't—""

""Enough!"" Damien cut me off. ""In front of all these people, you will apologize to Seraphina! Now!""

Chapter8

""I'm not apologizing.""

My voice cut through the murmuring crowd.

Damien froze. ""What did you say?""

""I said, I am not apologizing."" I pointed to a nearby building. ""There's a security memory crystal on that building. It records everything. Shall we review the footage?""

The color drained from Seraphina's face.

""No... don't bother,"" she said weakly. ""It was probably just an accident...""

But her words were cut off by a pained groan.

""The energy backlash!"" She clutched her chest, her face turning even paler. ""The laurel tree's repelling energy is too strong!""

Damien immediately scooped her into his arms. ""Hang on. I'm taking you to the healers.""

He sprinted across the street to the healing center without a single glance back at me.

The crowd began to disperse, but the whispers continued.

""That Isla is so cold-blooded.""

""The poor girl is pregnant and hurt, and she won't even say sorry.""

""No wonder the Alpha prefers the gentle one.""

I stood there, staring in the direction of the healing center.

Then I turned and walked away.

The next day was the final day before the ceremony.

In the morning, I shipped all my luggage.

All that was left was a small backpack with my essentials and my plane ticket.

A three o'clock flight.

At ten that night, Damien finally returned.

""How is Seraphina?"" I asked.

""Stable,"" he said, his voice frigid. ""The pack healer said if she hadn't gotten there in time, she could have lost the pup.""

""That's good.""

Damien stalked over to me, the anger still simmering in his eyes.

""At the ceremony tomorrow,"" he commanded, his voice leaving no room for argument, ""you will make a public apology to her.""

""What ceremony?""

""Our Mating Ceremony."" He frowned. ""Did you forget?""

I looked at him and suddenly wanted to laugh.

""You really think there's going to be a ceremony?""

""Of course there is. I've already informed all the Elders."" Damien's tone grew impatient. ""For the sake of the pack's honor, you need to be the bigger person.""

His phone suddenly rang.

""Damien, I'm not feeling well,"" Seraphina's voice came through the speaker. ""Can you come be with me?""

Damien shot to his feet. ""I'm on my way.""

He grabbed his jacket and headed for the door.

""Nine a.m. tomorrow. Don't be late,"" he commanded without looking back. ""The ceremony will proceed on time.""

The moment the door clicked shut, I let the silence settle.

Then, I spoke the words into the empty room, each one a final, liberating vow.

""I, Isla, reject you, Damien.""

He was already gone.

I waited until morning.

Sitting at the dining table, I took out the calendar marked with the ceremony date.

With a red pen, on today's date, I wrote:

The Bond is Rejected.

Then I grabbed my suitcase and walked out of the place I had once called home.

On the way to the airport, I sent a single text to the Head Elder.

Initiate the Severing Ritual. The Mating Ceremony is canceled.

By 9:30 a.m., my plane was in the air.

Below me, the city—the pack, my past, him—shrank until it was swallowed by the clouds.

I pictured Damien in that moment.

He would have arrived at the sacred altar by now.

Dressed in his finest robes, waiting for his bride.

1mmcy51,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hot_Romance_Stories/comments/1mmcy51/the_divorce_he_never_saw_coming/,The Divorce He Never Saw Coming,"Four years of marriage. One signature—his own—that set me free, though he never realized what he was signing.

I was Sophia Moretti, the invisible wife of James Moretti, heir to the city’s most powerful mafia family. But when his childhood sweetheart, the dazzling and privileged Vicky, returned, I finally understood: I had always been temporary.

So I played my final move. I slid the papers across his desk—divorce disguised as routine university forms. James signed without a second glance, his fountain pen scratching across the page as carelessly as he'd treated our vows, without noticing he was ending our marriage.

But I walked away with more than my freedom. Beneath my coat, I carried his unborn heir—a secret that could destroy him when he finally realized what he'd lost.

Now, the man who never noticed me is tearing the world apart trying to find me. From his penthouse to the underworld's gutters, he's turning over every stone. But I'm not some trembling prey waiting to be found.

I rebuilt myself beyond his reach—where not even a Moretti can follow.

This time, I won't be begging for his love.

He'll be begging for mine.

Chapter 1

I walked into the law office with my divorce papers clutched in my hand. Four years. Four years as Sophia Moretti, wife of James Moretti, heir to the most powerful mafia family in the city.

Today, it ended.

The lawyer didn’t even look up when I walked in.

""I’d like to file for divorce,"" I said, placing the papers on his desk.

He finally glanced at me—messy ponytail, faded jeans, my backpack still slung over one shoulder. His expression turned stern. ""Young lady, divorce isn’t something you file on a whim.""

I understood why he didn’t take me seriously. I looked like a college student who had wandered into the wrong office, not someone who had been married for four years.

But I was prepared.

""Just stamp the papers,"" I said calmly. ""I’ll get my husband’s signature.""

The Moretti estate was too quiet when I returned. The guards at the gate didn't even blink as I passed—just another invisible fixture in James' world.

I headed straight for James' study. The door was slightly open, and I could hear laughter inside.

Then I smelled it.

Truffles.

James always said he hated strong smells in the house. No garlic, no fish, nothing that lingered. But now, the air was thick with the scent of expensive white truffles, the kind you only get if you are the right person.

I pushed the door open.

There he was. James Moretti, my husband, sitting at his desk, relaxed in a way I'd never seen with me. And beside him was Vicky Rossi, his childhood best friend, back in the city this year after her divorce.

She was feeding him a piece of bread covered in truffles, her fingers lingering just a second too long.

Then James saw me. His smile disappeared.

""Sophia,"" he said, voice cool. ""I didn't expect you back so soon.""

Vicky turned, her perfect red lips curling into a smile. ""Oh, Sophia! We were just having a snack. There's only enough for two, but I'm sure we can—”

""I'm fine."" I cut her off, stepping forward.

I slid the document across the polished mahogany desk, the rustle of paper unnaturally loud in the silent study. James barely glanced up from his whiskey with his glass froze midway to his lips. James' eyes narrowed slightly. ""What's this?""

""The university needs a signed safety liability form,"" I flipped it open to the signature page.

""For my research project,"" I swallowed. ""Since you're my only family now.""

The truth sat heavy between us. My parents had been gone for years, killed in a suspicious car accident that first pushed me into James' world. He knew better than anyone how alone I was.

James frowned, ""Let me see that—"" My nerves suddenly tightened like piano wires. He never asked to read anything. Normally he'd just sign whatever university paperwork I put in front of him without a second glance.

Why today? Why now?

""Oh James,"" Vicky laughed, placing a hand on his arm. ""You're too serious! It's just a form. You remember how many forms we had to sign for the charity gala last month?""

As the heiress to Rossi Enterprises, one of the Moretti family's most important business partners, Vicky had moved effortlessly in James' world since her return. They were always together now, at galas, auctions, and those smoky backroom poker games where deals got made. Everywhere James went these days, Vicky seemed to appear at his elbow, her designer dresses complementing his tailored suits like they were a matched set.

He hesitated, then grabbed his fountain pen and signed with a quick flourish, the same way he signed death warrants and business deals.

I took the papers back before he could see the bold ""DIVORCE PETITION"" header on the first page.

Vicky smirked, ""Honestly, James, you treat her more like a kid sister than a wife.""

James didn't deny it. Just took a sip of whiskey.

I turned and walked out before they could see my hands shake.

The door closed behind me.

I was free.

Walking through the marble halls of the Moretti mansion, I clutched the signed divorce papers in my hand. The ink was barely dry, but the marriage had been over long before today.

I remembered how different James used to be. The way his warm hands would trace my spine when he thought I was asleep. The possessive way he'd pull me into shadowed corners at family gatherings, his mouth hot against mine.

Now he barely looked at me.

My parents died when I was sixteen. Don Moretti, the reigning head of the Moretti mafia family at the time, took me in as a favor to my father—his former driver who'd taken a bullet for him. That's how I ended up living under the same roof as James Moretti.

James was everything I shouldn't want. Cold. Dangerous. Ruthless. By twenty-five, he'd already taken over half his father's operations. The newspapers called him a ""young entrepreneur."" The streets knew better.

I kept my distance at first. Made myself invisible. Until that night four years ago, when James came home covered in someone else's blood.

He found me in the kitchen patching up my own knife wound, a gift from one of his father's men who thought the boss's charity case made easy prey.

James didn't speak. Just took the bandages from my shaking hands and cleaned the cut himself. When his thumb brushed my inner thigh, I should have pushed him away.

Instead, I pulled him closer.

We married three weeks later. A business arrangement, James called it. Protection for me, legitimacy for him. I almost believed him—until Vicky Rossi came back to town and suddenly his late meetings doubled.

Vicky. The Rossi heiress. Their construction empire worked closely with the Moretti family. Since returning after her divorce, And now that her French husband had filed for divorce, she'd become a constant presence——slipping into James' meetings, his cars, his life.

Last month proved it.

I'd waited six hours at Dante's—the restaurant James owned through a shell company—for our anniversary dinner. His right-hand man Michael finally showed up at midnight with a diamond bracelet and an excuse about ""business troubles.""

The next morning, I saw the photos in the gossip column: James and Vicky at the opera, her fingers tucked in his tuxedo pocket where he usually kept his gun.

That's when I started planning my exit.

The divorce papers were my final exam. James signed them without reading—too distracted by Vicky feeding him stolen glances and stolen kisses.

Now, standing in the mansion's gilded foyer, I traced the notary's embossed seal with my thumb. In a month, this paper would be my ticket to freedom.

No more gilded cages. No more pretending.

James could keep his empire. His violence. His Vicky.

I wanted my life back.

Chapter 2

Vicky claimed her penthouse needed renovations after her return. That’s how she ended up in our guest suite—temporarily, of course.

James approved it before I could object. ""The Rossis have been business partners for for decades,"" he said, as if that explained everything.

Now she floated through our home like she owned it—lounging by the pool in designer bikinis, hosting her parties in our wine cellar, always finding reasons to interrupt when James and I were alone.

Tonight, I caught them in the study, heads bent over some legal documents. Vicky’s long finger traced a line on the paper, lingering too close to James’ hand.

""Sophia!"" She smiled when she noticed me. ""We're planning my new home theater. You should join us.""

""I have lab reports to grade,"" I said, clutching my nightgown. We're divorced now. Whatever James does. Whoever he's with. It's none of my business.

Vicky's laugh tinkled like broken glass. ""Always buried in your books! James used to do my math homework when we were kids - you tutored me yourself, didn't you James? My math skills are all thanks to you.""

James chuckled lightly. ""Math was simpler than laundering casino profits."" His eyes flicked briefly to me, a silent check for reaction.

I kept my face carefully blank, staring at my feet. How touching, their childhood bond still going strong after all these years. I'd just be here, counting the days until I could escape this charming reunion.

By midnight, I was reviewing lab data when James entered our bedroom. The scent of whiskey and Vicky’s cloying perfume clung to his shirt as he sat beside me on the bed.

""Still working?"" His fingers brushed my shoulder.

I stiffened instinctively. Yet when his hand slid down my spine, I arched into his touch like a starving woman offered crumbs.

Pathetic, some rational part of my brain whispered. But four years of loneliness had carved a hollow space inside me that only James could temporarily fill, even if he'd never stay.

His lips found my neck as he unbuttoned the front of my nightgown. I closed my eyes and let myself forget—

—until my stomach turned violently.

""Sophia?"" James froze as I clapped a hand over my mouth.

The queasy feeling disappeared as fast as it hit me. ""Just...ate something odd at the lab today,"" I offered weakly. The birth control pills I took religiously made pregnancy impossible, but my stomach seemed to rebel at the thought of Vicky sleeping right beneath us while James touched me.

Just then, a crash came from downstairs.

""James?"" Vicky’s voice floated up the staircase, trembling. ""I heard glass breaking... I think someone’s in the house.""

I felt James’ body tense. Duty called.

He was out of bed before I could speak, grabbing the pistol from his nightstand. ""Stay here,"" he ordered, already halfway to the door.

Turned out to be nothing—just the housekeeper dropping a plate. But when James returned hours later, he went straight to the shower without a word. I pretended to be asleep.

The next morning, I nearly choked on my coffee when I saw James flipping through my research institute application forms—the ones I’d stupidly left on the kitchen counter. My stomach tightened.

""Biomedical engineering?"" He held up the application to the Swiss institute's application, his brow arched. "" When did you arrange this overseas project?""

I forced a shrug. ""My classmate asked me to grab the forms for her."" My fingers curled into my palms—out of sight, out of mind—but not before I caught the faint tremor in my pinky finger. Damn it.

James turned a page, scanning the details. ""Zurich. You’d hate the snow.""

Of course he didn’t remember. Two winters ago, I’d dragged him to a cabin in Vermont just to watch the flakes fall. He’d spent the whole time on the phone with his lawyers.

I didn't respond. Just look at him coldly.

He set down his coffee, his dark eyes locking onto mine with unsettling intensity. ""You don’t need another degree. I could appoint you lead researcher at Moretti Medical tomorrow.""

That’s the problem. Every achievement I had, every paper, every grant, was shadowed by the Moretti name. I opened my mouth to retort when Vicky’s laughter cut through the tension.

""Morning, darlings!"" She breezed in, her silk robe fluttering as she perched on the arm of James’ chair. ""James, the lawyers need us to review the new casino contracts before noon."" Her slender fingers brushed against James' shoulder in a familiar gesture.

James stood up without another glance at my applications. ""We’ll take it in the study.""

As they disappeared down the hall, I yanked the forms back. My hand steadied as I reached the Marital Status.

Single.

Chapter 3

The research fellowship in Switzerland would last for four years. The director had emailed twice already, eager for me to start by fall. Four years abroad. Far from James. Far from Vicky. I sent ""Accept"" before I could overthink it.

Last night played on repeat in my mind. I'd actually considered—just one last time—initiating something with James. A final memory to take with me. But he'd spent the evening with Vicky, probably whispering sweet nothings under the moon.

That's the difference between love and...whatever this is.

What I couldn't understand was how a man could feign desire so convincingly for someone he didn't love. To prevent a repeat of last night's humiliation, I decided to clear out my things today. Three weeks until the divorce was finalized. Three weeks of avoiding this house.

Most of my life was already at campus housing—just one suitcase of clothes here. The only personal item was the photo album in the nightstand.

I flipped through the thick leather cover. Every month like clockwork, I'd dragged James to a photo studio. Me smiling like an idiot. Him stiff as a statue, looking anywhere but at the camera.

The album landed in the trash bin with a thud. Even the recycling truck wouldn't want this tainted love story.

For years, I'd been an audience member in James Moretti's life. Now the curtain had fallen. Time to make my exit.

The next two weeks blurred with thesis revisions and lab work. I barely thought of James—until his call interrupted my Friday research meeting.

""I'm outside your lab,"" his voice crackled through the phone.

Since when does James Moretti play chauffeur?

His black sedan idled at the curb. I slid into the leather seat, inhaling the familiar scent of his cologne and gun oil.

""You haven't been home."" His eyes stayed on the road.

""Lab's busy.""

""Good."" His fingers tapped the steering wheel. ""Vicky thought you were avoiding her. She's moving out next month—says it's 'inappropriate' now.""

I yawned. ""Tell her not to bother. I don't care.""

James' grip tightened on the steering wheel, his knuckles paling to bone-white. A flicker of surprise crossed his face. He opened his mouth—probably to praise my ""maturity""—but stopped when he noticed my closed eyes.

I feigned sleep to avoid conversation, but the exhaustion was real. For the first time in years, my dreams weren't about him.

Ten days until Switzerland.

I stood in the supermarket aisle, staring at the dried hawthorn slices in my hand. I hadn't eaten these since childhood, but lately my stomach churned at everything else. My recent period had also been delayed.

The pregnancy test confirmed my fears.

""twelve weeks along,"" the doctor said cheerfully. ""Congratulations!""

I nearly laughed. Twelve weeks. That meant it happened during James' and my last time together—right before Vicky returned.

My hands shook as I dialed James' number. At twenty-four, facing this alone terrified me—

A familiar ringtone echoed down the hallway.

James stood twenty feet away, his black coat draped over Vicky's shoulders as she whispered something that made him smile. I hung up and ducked into the stairwell.

""—avoid strenuous activity,"" the doctor's voice carried through the cracked door. ""And no intercourse for two months.""

Vicky was pregnant too.

""I'll make sure she rests,"" James said, that tender tone I rarely heard.

I shot out of the stairwell like a bullet, desperate to escape, only to crash straight into a nurse carrying medical charts. The papers went flying as we collided, creating just enough noise to draw attention from down the hall.

James emerged from the examination room just in time to see me scrambling to help pick up the scattered documents, my face burning with the effort to appear composed.

""Sophia?"" He frowned, stepping forward. ""Why are you here?""

""Stomachache."" I crumpled the ultrasound slip in my pocket.

Vicky materialized beside him, clutching her own scan. ""James told me you skip meals."" She patted his arm. ""We should get her some ginger tea.""

I couldn't tear my eyes away from the ultrasound photo in Vicky's hand. The grainy black-and-white image seemed to pulse under the harsh hospital lights.

James' face went pale. ""Sophia, let me expl—""

""James!"" Vicky's fingers dug into his sleeve like claws, her voice dripping with false sweetness. ""We talked about this.""

I saw the conflict play out across his face, the way his muscles tensed, how his hand twitched before curling into a fist.

Then Vicky pressed her cheek against his shoulder, whispering something that made him freeze. His arm dropped to his side like a dead weight.

I turned away before they could see my face crumple. Behind me, I heard James take a half-step forward—

""James!"" Vicky's voice turned sharp. ""You promised.""

The elevator doors closed on the image of my husband standing frozen between two women, his eyes locked on me with something that almost looked like regret.

Outside, winter air slapped my face. The research acceptance letter lay buried at the bottom of my backpack. Four years. A groundbreaking study. A life far from this mess.

And now—a baby.

My hand rested on my stomach—still flat, but everything had changed. The sidewalk stretched endlessly in both directions.

For the first time in my life, I had nowhere to go.

Chapter 4

For forty-eight hours, I'd been drafting and deleting emails to the research institute. How do I tell the director I accidentally pregnant by my soon-to-be-ex husband? My fingers hovered over the keyboard when my phone buzzed.

Michael: Boss wants to see you at the gates.

Since when did James send his right-man as a messenger boy?

I spotted James leaning casually against his Mercedes, the morning sunlight softening his sharp features in a way that made my breath catch for a moment. The way the light traced his jawline, the slight crinkle at the corners of his eyes as he noticed my approach - it was unfair how my pulse still quickened at the sight of him after everything.

I quickly looked away, fingers fumbling with my backpack strap as if it demanded all my attention. Four years of marriage, and my traitorous body still reacted to him like we were newlyweds. The heat that rose to my cheeks, the way my skin remembered his touch - biological betrayals I refused to acknowledge. Old habits, I told myself firmly. Just muscle memory, nothing more.

""Sophia."" He removed his glasses, revealing those dark eyes that used to make my knees weak. ""Dinner tomorrow. Dante's. Eight o'clock.""

Dante's. The name alone sent acid creeping up my throat. That was where I'd sat for six hours on our anniversary, staring at cold osso buco while James ""handled business"" with Vicky.

""I'll be there,"" I heard myself say, the words leaping from my lips before I could temper them. The automatic response surprised even me—why so eager to sit across from the man who'd chosen Vicky over me at every turn?

But hesitation would raise suspicions. James could smell weakness like blood in the water. If I was going to keep this baby—and I had every intention to—I needed to do things right. Hiding the pregnancy meant nothing if I didn't first sever all legal ties between us. James Moretti wasn't the type to let anything slip through his fingers, least of all a child. And if he ever found out I'd kept his heir from him...

No. The divorce had to come first. Clean. Official. Irreversible.

This dinner would serve two purposes: First, the divorce. Then, when oceans separated us, I'd decide how to tell him about the baby. If ever.

The restaurant's chandeliers cast knife-sharp shadows across the white tablecloths. Tonight, he'd chosen the private wine cellar where we'd had our first date.

His fingers wrapped around mine as he set down the Barolo bottle—not just brushing past, but actually holding my hand for the first time in four years.

""There's something I need to explain about what happened—""

The cellar door crashed open. Michael rushed to his side, whispering urgently against his ear. But in the tomb-like quiet of the stone-walled cellar, the words ""Vicky"", ""cut her wrist"" and ""emergency"" slithered to my ears regardless.

My stomach dropped. Of course. Even our last dinner couldn't be just ours.

James' grip on my hand released as he shot to his feet, his chair screeching backward before toppling with a crash. ""What?!""

The room spun. My vision tunneled until all I could see was James' retreating back, his coat flaring like a cape.

He paused at the doorway just long enough to glance between Michael and me—a fraction of a second's calculation. ""Take her to the hospital,"" he ordered before disappearing up the stairs.

Then—nothing.

Fragments of conversation drifted through the haze:

""...just low blood sugar...""

""...get her some orange juice...""

My eyelids fluttered open to blurred shapes - the doctor speaking with Michael by the doorway. A jolt of panic shot through me as consciousness returned. If they discover the pregnancy...

The doctor leaned closer to Michael, her voice dropping to a murmur. ""And considering the patient's condit—""

My dry throat constricted. I had to stop her—

BRRRRT!

Michael's phone screamed like a fire alarm. He ripped it from his pocket, the caller ID making him snap to attention. ""Yes, boss?"" A beat. His jaw tightened. ""Understood. On my way now, sir.""

He slapped a black credit card onto the doctor's clipboard. ""Keep her here till New Year's if you want."" The door rattled in its frame as he vanished, the doctor's lips still parted around the unspoken ""pregnant"".

""Ah, you're awake."" She turned to me, oblivious to my racing pulse. ""You're approximately thirteen weeks along. Baby's healthy, but given your collapse..."" Her pen scratched across a notepad. ""We'll keep you 48 hours for monitoring.""

She hesitated, glancing at the door. ""I didn't mention this to your... companion earlier.""

I exhaled in quiet relief. ""No. And please keep it that way.""

As the doctor stepping out, the nurses' hushed voices slithered under the curtain:

"" Mr. and Mrs. Moretti are like royalty—They've turned Suite 801 into a penthouse - rose petals, champagne, the works. Mr. Moretti hasn't left her side since admission.""

""Would you expect less? Did you see how he carried her through the lobby? Like some romantic film.""

A sigh. ""Ten years together and he still treats her like a bride. Meanwhile my husband forgets our anniversary...""

Their words cut deeper than any knife. There was no question – they could only be talking about James and Vicky.

""Of course he's devoted – Mrs. Moretti's finally giving him an heir. Mr. Moretti’d commanded an army of specialists at her slightest sigh.""

James treated Vicky like a queen. I became acutely aware of my chipped nail polish against the starch hospital sheets - the lone Moretti wife no one remembered to pamper.

After two nights of observation with no complications, I was discharged.

Stepping out of the hospital's automatic doors, I spotted Emma waiting by the curb, the manila envelope clutched in her hands.

Stepping through the hospital's sliding doors, my first stop was the courthouse to collect the divorce decree. As I arranged for James' copy to be mailed—with a deliberate three-day delay—a quiet satisfaction settled in my chest.

By the time this reaches his desk, I thought, watching the clerk stamp the postmark, I'll be in Zurich. Let the mighty James Moretti turn over every stone in the world. But even his power has limits—and I just became one of them.

The envelope disappeared into the mailbox with a soft thud—four years of love, lies and loneliness now condensed into a single document that would chase my shadow across the ocean.

Chapter 5

I stared at the sent email—the one confessing my pregnancy to the Swiss institute. Now, there was nothing to do but wait. I placed my hand on my stomach almost unconsciously, as if to reassure us both.

The director replied within hours:

""Congratulations on this new chapter! We've prepared family housing just steps from the lab, and Dr. Laurent's wife, our chief obstetrician, has personally reserved all your prenatal appointments. Most importantly—we're dispatching a team member to escort you from the airport door to your new home. No luggage handling, no queues, no stress whatsoever!""

I stared at the screen. No hesitation. No judgment. Just support. Something tightened in my chest—maybe the first real hope I'd felt since seeing those two pink lines.

""Thank you,"" I typed back, ""for valuing me beyond my current circumstances.""

On the day of my departure, I stood nervously at the arrivals gate, scanning the crowd for my institute contact. A voice called out - ""Sophia?""

I turned to see a lanky man with gentle eyes pushing through the crowd. Eric, according to his badge, greeted me with a warmth that immediately put me at ease. He took my single suitcase carefully, as if handling rare artifacts. ""Priority boarding is ready,"" he smiled. ""The director insisted on VIP treatment for our star researcher.""

As Eric maneuvered toward me, his shoulder briefly blocked my view of a commotion near the VIP lounge—where James stood with Vicky clinging to his arm, their backs turned as they greeted a group of Middle Eastern businessmen.

At that precise moment, James stiffened.

""Did someone just call Sophia?""

Vicky's crystalline laugh bounced off. ""Don't be ridiculous, James. Sophia is probably buried in lab right now."" Vicky said as she pulled James toward a champagne reception.

We disappeared into the shuffling queue before his gaze could sweep our direction.

As we walked toward the gate, Eric animatedly described the lab's new two-photon microscope. ""Dr. Laurent had it installed specifically for your protein research,"" he said, eyes bright with the kind of academic passion I'd nearly forgotten existed.

He adjusted his grip on my suitcase. ""Oh, and the team unanimously voted to adopt your preferred schedule—no morning meetings before nine, and absolutely no evening work.""

I pressed a hand to my sternum. These people, who'd never met me, had tried hard to anticipate my needs better than James ever had in four years of marriage.

At security, Eric handed me a stack of postcards—the Alps glittering under cheap gloss. ""For writing home,"" he said with an encouraging nod.

The trash bin swallowed them whole.

Eric blinked. ""No one to write to?""

I glanced back at the terminal windows, where the city skyline stood sharp against the dawn. Somewhere out there, James was probably reviewing Vicky's latest ultrasound photos over breakfast, her diamond-crusted hand resting on his arm.

""Not anymore,"" I said, turning toward the gate.

The plane rumbled to life beneath us. Eric prattled about Zurich's farmer's markets—""The peaches in August! You'll think you've tasted sunlight!""—while I pressed a hand to the window.

Goodbye to photos where only one of us smiled.

Goodbye to the mansion that never felt like home.

Goodbye, James.

1mmcvv8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutisticAdults/comments/1mmcvv8/feeling_foreign_in_my_own_country/,Feeling foreign in my own country,"Hiya,

Felt like writing a post after a sunday morning pondering session haha.  
But first off, to whom this matters: I'm self-suspecting, not formally diagnosed.

  
I'm not a native English speaker. And I don't write this to excuse my bad English, because my English is in fact not that bad, or by German standards actually very good.  
Arguably, my biggest special interest is film culture. When I was 15 I started watching the latest season of How I Met Your Mother in English, since the German dub did not exist as of that point. And I never went back to watching dubs. Two decades later, I'm still a major cinephile, watching movies and shows from all over the world, in whatever language they were originally created (with English or German subtitles of course).  
I'm very hardcore like that and Germany at large just loooves their dubbed versions. So, in regards to my greatest passion, I don't mesh well with the rest of my society. And it takes a toll on me, honestly.  
I can hardly relate to anything that is popular right now around my parts of the world.  
Whenever I meet new people, I'm very hesitant to mention that I only watch original versions, in fear of being labeled pretentious or arrogant. I should be so proud of the way I learned English from watching all those movies and shows, but instead I'm ashamed to bring it up. That's kind of fucked.

I have a handful of friends who either like watching in English or are at least willing to do it occasionally, for my sake, which I am absolutely grateful for.  
But I'm still feeling so isolated with my interest. And like I don't really have place to fit in where I'm currently at.

There really isn't much in my country's culture that I identify with. Being on Bumble (dating app) seems to prove this again and again. Aside from the standard people without a real personality (their hobbies being drinking coffee and traveling, basically) there are people on there that are niche, so to speak. But not in the way I am. And I can't identify with none of those people.  
Of course I realize, that finding a person that is 'just like me (100%)' is a bit out there, in terms of being a concept lol.  
But I still would like to find someone, platonic or romantic, that I can vibe with in a real way.

In short: My country has a weird lowbrow culture that I don't understand and don't want to be a part of.",1,1754813080.0,AutisticAdults,0,1.0,False

The super creamer market is booming, offering a wide array of options that cater to various dietary needs and preferences.

## Key Features Analysis

The best super creamers boast a range of features that set them apart from customary dairy and non-dairy creamers. These features impact the taste, texture, and overall health profile of the beverage.

**Zero Sugar or Low Sugar Content:** Many super creamers are formulated with zero added sugar or contain considerably less sugar than conventional alternatives. This is achieved through the use of natural sweeteners like stevia, monk fruit, or erythritol.

This feature caters to individuals managing blood sugar levels,following ketogenic or low-carb diets,or simply looking to reduce their overall sugar intake. The absence of refined sugar minimizes insulin spikes and prevents the undesirable crash often associated with sugary creamers.

**Healthy Fats:** super creamers frequently incorporate healthy fats from sources like coconut oil, MCT oil, or avocado oil. These fats provide sustained energy, support brain function, and contribute to a feeling of satiety.

These oils not only enhance the creamy texture but also deliver medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs),which are known for their potential benefits in weight management and cognitive performance. Unlike saturated fats found in some dairy creamers, these healthier fats are generally considered beneficial for cardiovascular health.

**added Vitamins and Minerals:** Certain super creamers are fortified with essential vitamins and minerals, such as vitamin D, calcium, or B vitamins. This adds an extra layer of nutritional value to your morning coffee or tea.

This enrichment makes the creamer a functional food, contributing to overall well-being and addressing potential nutritional deficiencies. The specific vitamins and minerals included can vary depending on the brand and formulation.

**Dairy-Free and plant-Based Options:** Super creamers are frequently dairy-free, catering to individuals with lactose intolerance, dairy allergies, or those following vegan or plant-based diets. they are often made from ingredients like coconut cream, almond milk, oat milk, or cashew milk.

These dairy-free alternatives offer a creamy texture and appetizing flavor without the digestive discomfort frequently enough associated with dairy. the variety of plant-based options provides choices to suit different tastes and dietary restrictions.

**Unique Flavor Profiles:** Beyond the standard vanilla and hazelnut, super creamers come in a wide array of exciting and innovative flavors. These flavors can range from seasonal favorites like pumpkin spice to more exotic options like salted caramel or mocha.

This variety caters to a broad range of palates and allows users to experiment with different taste combinations. The use of natural flavorings ensures a delicious and authentic taste experience.

**Functional Ingredients:** Some super creamers contain functional ingredients like collagen, adaptogens, or probiotics. These ingredients are added to provide specific health benefits, such as improved skin health, stress reduction, or enhanced gut health.

The addition of these ingredients transforms the creamer into a health-boosting beverage. Such as, collagen peptides may support joint health and skin elasticity, while adaptogens like ashwagandha may help the body cope with stress.

Key features of super creamers include:

*   Zero or low sugar content
*   Healthy fat sources
*   Added vitamins and minerals
*   Dairy-free and plant-based options
*   Unique flavor profiles
*   Functional ingredients

## Core Benefits

Super creamers offer a range of advantages beyond the traditional creamer's basic function. These benefits cater to health-conscious consumers and those seeking to enhance their beverages' nutritional value.

**Enhanced Energy Levels:** The healthy fats present in many super creamers, particularly MCT oil, provide a sustained energy release, preventing the energy crashes associated with sugary creamers. This leads to improved focus and productivity throughout the day.

For example, starting your morning with coffee and a super creamer containing MCT oil can provide a longer-lasting energy boost compared to a sugar-laden creamer. This sustained energy can improve alertness and cognitive function.

**improved Gut Health:** Some super creamers contain probiotics, which are beneficial bacteria that support a healthy gut microbiome. A balanced gut microbiome can improve digestion, boost immunity, and enhance overall well-being.Consuming a super creamer with probiotics regularly can contribute to a healthier digestive system. This can lead to reduced bloating, improved nutrient absorption, and a stronger immune response.

**Weight Management Support:** The combination of healthy fats, low sugar content, and potential added fiber in super creamers can contribute to effective weight management. The fats promote satiety, reducing cravings and overeating.

Using a super creamer with MCT oil can aid in weight loss by promoting feelings of fullness and boosting metabolism. The low sugar content also prevents blood sugar spikes that can lead to increased fat storage.

**Dietary Adherence:** Super creamers offer a way to indulge in flavored coffee or tea without compromising dietary restrictions. The availability of dairy-free, sugar-free, and keto-amiable options makes it easier to adhere to specific eating plans.

Individuals following ketogenic diets can enjoy creamy coffee without exceeding their carbohydrate limits by using a keto-friendly super creamer. similarly,those who are lactose intolerant can enjoy the creaminess of dairy without digestive discomfort by choosing a plant-based option.

Some creamers may be specifically formulated for iced beverages, so it's always best to check the product label for specific instructions.

1mmcsl9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mmcsl9,A LITTLE KINDNESS GOES A LONG WAY! 🛜💙,"A coffee shop along Jalandoni Street in Iloilo City allows free WiFi to its neighbors! Uploader Nereo Cajilig Luján shared a heartwarming scene captured outside their coffee shop, [The Coffee Studio](https://www.facebook.com/TheCoffeeStudioIloilo?__cft__[0]=AZV0SHXN0XDwYHjI4S1xdan2S4Cwjhc73XRomk88zW7IDOKtpQpZHRSO7NCNavvcqOrFIM-TeDwRJnkbKcEdcizDDxH7X3635Qj2IRNQ4J1hKItmKm9yP_Jz69b7zrXKLaHpi8-l4Hw_14gMOus6PVbBzquWe9YAPd6ii4_w5u4eBA&__tn__=-]K-R), as some neighbors gather after hours for a free WiFi connection.   
  
When his son Russell opened the shop in March 2023, he installed WiFi to accommodate their customers, who are usually students.  
  
“We are not a cafe na need ang minimum order para mabigyan ng password, open ito. Free wifi, free charging kami,” he told The Philippine STAR.  
  
While reviewing their CCTV footage, they noticed that some of their neighbors would crowd outside their cafe with smartphones glowing in the night.  
  
Nereo stressed that not all individuals captured may be using their WiFi, but some would approach them in the morning to thank their generosity.  
  
“We can only confirm when we were informed the next day, ‘yung mga pabiro na ‘Sir, nag WiFi ako dyan kagabi’ something like that,” he shared as he would reply to them with a smile.  
  
He expressed that their coffee shop is not just a place to purchase coffee but a warm space for everyone to gather and share stories. For Nereo and his family, the simple act of kindness in sharing their WiFi is their way of connecting with their community.  
  
“We are glad and thankful na nakakatulong kami kahit papaano. Kahit na ‘yung nag connect ay mga five mins of emergency message lang or for example, nawalan siya ng data at nag connect sandali para mag purchase ng data we are happy na sa short time na ‘yun ay nakatulong kami,” he added.

I’d previously received some useful advice in past threads. Here is the history:

https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/s/rgptSW79Yg

https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/s/cuxu0KsLGE

https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/s/xMUg2bVtnB

My last post was back at the beginning of June in which I (45m) was thinking of a way to initiate a conversation with my girlfriend (42f) about the “condom/Tony situation”. 

In the end I couldn’t think of a way to phrase it without an implied accusation that I think she might have been lying about the condoms, which I didn’t want to do. So I addressed it more generally. She had once joked (very obviously in a teasing kind of way) about having another guy on the side. So I basically used that and asked if she was in fact not joking about that etc. Her response was very kind and reassuring that she wasn’t. That she would talk to me or break up with me if she was unhappy rather than start something else on the side etc.

This was all very reassuring. But the coincidences in the “condom/Tony story” still left me feeling a bit uncertain. 

Fast forward to mid-July. I found out via Tony’s instagram that his stint in Cats was coming to an end, and his next show would be back here in the city my gf and me live in. I was sitting with my gf and a friend of hers and we were talking about a certain country we’d like to visit. My gf then said to her friend: “oh Tony might be taking his show there next year, in which case I’ll probably go then.” So that rang an alarm in my mind. My gf didn’t know I knew who Tony was at this stage.

Then a couple of weeks ago she spoke about him to me openly for the first time. She mentioned a female friend of hers is working on his show. So I asked if I’d met him before via her theatre group. She said no. She then went on to describe him as a young actor (26m), very talented, extremely handsome, well-built and manly (In this context she meant manly as in not effeminate -she is not a native speaker of English), so he is almost guarantee a decent career in acting. Apparently being effeminate as a male actor can rule them out of a lot of parts. 

I took this opportunity to communicate my insecurities a little bit. I basically just said something like “oh so you’re travelling to country x with a young, fit, extremely handsome guy eh?” That kind of thing.

Again her response was very reassuring and kind. She basically just said that she is not interested in a guy so much younger than her. That the only threat to me would be another clone of myself or a twin brother or something like that. She said she recently met Tony for a coffee to give him advice on running a theatre company, at her local coffee shop where she knows the baristas. Apparently the barista asked her if Tony is her son because he looks so much younger than her, and she is not interested in something like that. She also said if she wanted to be with Tony she would be with him and not me, but doubts he would even be interested in her anyway. She said she’s known him since he was 17 so being with him would be too weird. She also said she’s happy that I aired my concerns because it shows how much I like her, and that she found it sweet. She also said me and her could go to country x and see Tony’s show together. 

So basically as an answer I couldn’t really have asked for much more than that. I suppose if it was roles reversed I’d have offered to show her my WhatsApp chats but I don’t think the fact she didn’t is a huge red flag here. Although the fact she revealed that she had recently met up with him and hadn’t mentioned it to me could indicate some trickle truthing going on. She also mentioned in his upcoming show he has to read some text in her language so he’s been sending her voice recordings on WhatsApp to get her feedback on his pronunciation. So there seems to be some regular contact. 

I still feel a bit unsettled about the coincidences in the condom story and will
have to address it with her I think. I realise I should’ve done this already and haven’t handled this optimally at all. In my defence, I have some avoidance stuff going on and find challenging emotional situations very overwhelming. The fact that I’m addressing it at all, however haphazardly, is sort of progress for me. I’ve also started therapy as this whole thing has made me aware of some self-esteem issues that I need to address. So I’ll be unpacking all this with my therapist too, and won’t unload anything more on to my gf without discussing with my therapist first.

To add some context, generally she seems very invested in me. She was the one to initiate exclusivity talks, she’s told me things like she’s falling in love with me, that I’m a special person, kind, have a good soul, make her feel safe and that she can be herself with me, that sex with me is the best she’s ever had (I’m taking that one with a pinch of salt for now). She talks about future plans with me, she’s put photos of us up on her wall (the only other photos on her wall are of her closest friends). She makes time for me, we see each other very often. In fact since July apart from our holidays we’ve seen each other almost daily. 

That might all be a big lie to deflect my attention away from what she’s doing on the side, but if not then it could be a very nice relationship if I could just deal with this insecurity around the Tony/condom story.

Anyway any feedback gratefully received, including negative 😊

The reports suggested that the efforts were unconnected but evidence surfaced in 2022 that indicated otherwise.

Plaintiffs in a long-standing Georgia lawsuit filed in 2017, led by the Coalition for Good Governance (CGG), uncovered evidence that the voting equipment in Coffee County, Georgia had been unlawfully accessed. CGG is an allied organization to Free Speech For People, and Susan Greenhalgh, FSFP’s Senior Advisor for Election Security is a consulting expert to the CGG plaintiffs in the lawsuit.

After obtaining evidence that the voting system was improperly accessed, CGG successfully petitioned the Court for discovery regarding the breach in the Spring of 2022. Through records, emails, texts, surveillance videos, photographs, contracts, documents and depositions produced through court discovery, the plaintiffs amassed evidence that showed that Trump attorney Sidney Powell hired computer forensics operatives to go to Coffee County, and with the cooperation of the County’s election director and GOP county chair, copied all of the software on the voting devices. The records also revealed that the Georgia voting system breach was part of a larger, coordinated plot to similarly take software from voting equipment in other states and share it with the same network of Trump allies.""

So did I spill it or was this a freak accident? I seriously can't wrap my head around it and my mom is really pissed.,0,1754812230.0,NoStupidQuestions,8,0.2,False

Previously i edited with the help of AI but i deleted that post and now i am writing by myself.

This Story begins from college. This conversation starts from the Group project. I  was preparing for the next days project and suddenly message appeared  in my inbox , that message was from her who was in our group now i will name her as (J). So she messaged me to do presentation because i was active and chill on the class, however at that day i had no mood to do and i message her to do by herself, and she mentioned her problem that she cant do because she is little bit shy and introvert among them, who isnt even close to her. At that time i realised my past where i was also suffered from the same condition and i feel the problems that occurs when people is introvert and i accept and i did it the next day., because i always like to help others people when they need. I did this to unknown people when its possible. Even I did volunteer. Later on We had a conversation  but not on other things just only on class or college related activity. We used Joke each other , which i used to do with my boys. But since that time i clearly mentioned that i had no intention to be in a relationship and she asked why? I said i just wanted to focus on my career and she said thats good.

All things were good. One day she asked during a conversation the question  in the chatbox- WHy we are talking to each other? I clearly said that  WIth a friend i am chill and do a joke. In  a possible Situation i helped her and also emotional support  just like my other friends. And she also said the same and also gave the another reasons that i didnt flirt to her and i used to keep others Information very secretly . Thats true , i was happy because i didnt said bad things or flirted to her.  During my college vacation , i was offline from all the social media. Later I found that she texted me a lots during that time. Even she messaged me from her fake account which i found later. After some time i returned to the social media where we had conversation where she sent me flirty message, which i wasnt going to accept in any condition because already said that i had no intention of relationship to anyone.  I replied that message in a positive way and ignored.

To clear her that i just wanna stay as a friend, i called her near to her house to have a conversation with a coffee. And First she was thinking more, where i clearly mentioned dont take this as a dating or couple conversation , just take as a friends conversation. And next day she agreed and we met. Conversation starts from study and more. Firstly she mentioned her family problem and i said be strong , make your mother happy . Apart from that i diss to the boy who used to flirt her , also he is one of my friend and i mentioned i had no intention of Relationship. Apart from that  i also mentioned that, i did a normal conversation as like to other girls .  Also i mentioned  it will be always good  to have  a good conversation with every girl but not flirty. Also, In a past i used to do a joke a lot, now a days i stopped - i said this to her(In this case she thought i think i tried to do a fake help and emotional support, in fact that not true, but in reality, I truly meant it from my heart. By the end, I noticed her facial expression got  changed. After I returned to the home, we had a conversation about our friendship, where talked about how it started. At that time i  joked and said,  it was only possible because she was introvert,  otherwise, it won’t  happened. She replied to me that - i becamefriend with because of pity towards her ?? Later, I said that was just a joke, but I don’t know what she thought after that. She stopped texting me like before and started avoiding me at college.

 In last i saw her face like different. From that day she stopped texting me like previously and she wanna avoid me in a possible situation . For example: in a college.  After that we had only two conversations. At the result day my phone rang where i saw a  call of her, that was after 1 month   and she asked about my result. I said i dont know what my result was because   i didnt know symbol number because i was out of house and i was offline from all the social media once again . She thought that, i lied to her and she  said then okay - you can inform me later. Also she passed the exam with good marks but  I didnt know till now,  whether that day she really wanna know my result as a friend or she wanna spy me whether i am pass or fail. Then after i went to college without saying her , and asked my result because my symbol number was lost. In fact i found later that  i was failed.  At that day I encountered her. And she asked me about my result and i said truth.  Later she message me and said what a unexpected meetup.  Also she asked me in which which subject did you passed and i said truth. Also I wished her all the best for her upcoming days.  Then after we havent messaged messaged  to each other .  Actually from the first meetup my anxiety  is increasing and unable to concentrate in MY study.I am trying to forget those past things by going futsal, meditation and many more but that still hitting me. I need a suggestion from you- Should I apologize to her and invest my energy? Then after will i able to move on? Or should i try to ignore and move on?

Note- I just shared the opinion and activity from my side and i shared only her  important  activities which is necessary in this context . But i havent mentioned her all the Good/ bad activities, which isnt necessary here in my opinion.",1,1754812198.0,NepalSocial,3,1.0,False

1mmcmq7,https://www.reddit.com/r/daddit/comments/1mmcmq7/how_do_we_stop_saturday_fights/,How do we stop Saturday fights?,"My wife and I have started joking about our “Saturday morning fight,” but honestly it’s exhausting and pointless. Almost every week, without fail, we clash.

I work 50–60 hours so she can be a SAHM to our 15-month-old for one more year. She has her weekday routine with him, I have mine. We see each other briefly for coffee or a quick meal, but basically live separate lives Monday–Friday.

Come Saturday, we both want to reconnect — but the gap we’ve built all week makes it hard. We struggle to align, adapt, and shift from “separate routines” to “being a couple again.” I’ve realized the fight is rarely about practical issues — it’s usually bottled-up emotions from the week spilling out. We both need to decompress, and maybe we just don’t know how to manage that well together yet.

We each want to lead, plan, and set the tone for the weekend, and those expectations often collide. Small things turn into big arguments. By Saturday night we’re fine, and Sunday we’re a happy family again… until next week.

The worst part is our son starting to see this. I come from a broken home and don’t want him growing up watching his parents fight over who and when will play with him.

Do you see this pattern in your own life? And what actually works to break it so we can save our energy — and set a stronger example for our kid?

Fear. 

I drank too much for too long and I am terrified of the damage that I have done to my body.

I miss the relieved chill that results from ice cold martinis at noon. I miss Irish coffee while smoking BBQ on crisp fall mornings. I miss the warm glow of a nip while sitting 'round the campfire at night. I miss sampling red wine for my ""heart and health"". I miss the euphoria that comes from drinking high end tequila like bottled water. 

I don't miss planning every aspect of my life around my next drink. I don't miss bouncing around between liquor and grocery stores like a fucking fugitive. I don't miss smuggling liquor onto cruise ships and planes. I don't miss the embarrassment and shame when asking the FA for a belt extension. I don't miss the Big and Tall store. I don't miss being a dick. I don't miss losing the memory of entire days, entire weeks, entire months as if I didn't exist.

I white knuckled my way here. No AA, no therapy, no detox, nothing. That is starting to feel like a mistake. I need to do something to fix my shit.

I have traded one addiction for another. Existential dread is my new constant and I crave control. I crave purpose.

I obsess over managing my health and controlling my outcomes. I incessantly read, study, and track medications, supplements, and food for clues to mitigate the harm that I've done to myself. I pace and walk constantly to rack up as many steps as possible because I read somewhere that it's somehow linked to mortality. I read the dark posts and updates on the cirrhosis sub. I doomscroll daily for clues, ideas, and solutions that will never come. I'm trapped in a temporal, recurring,  eternal loop. Every day is Groundhog Day.

I'm fucking miserable. Bored, anxious, restless, depressed, agitated, frustrated, guilty, afraid...

I know that a shot of something good will take it all away. For the moment at least. But I'm too fucking scared.

I need to fix my shit.

It feels like something that was a lot easier when I was younger. I get it, being surrounded by the same people every day at school / college makes it easier to get very close, and you don't really get that in the same way when you're older.

Even if you're surrounded by the same people at work, it's a totally different vibe - with how the people around you may be at completely different stages of life, and how the environment is less casual. So, I find that it doesn't happen organically, in the same way it might in school / college.

I'm decent enough at making friends. I go to the occasional board games event, and I host board games weekly. Also, I might occasionally ask a friend to hang out and get coffee. I enjoy it, and a lot of the time it gets me my socialising fix.

But I feel lost as to how I might move that from a surface-level friendship, to something more meaningful.

So, to the autistic adults out there, a few things I'd like to know:

* Have you had any success making close friends as an adult, without the help of school or college?
   * What did this look like?
   * Did you to take any active steps to allow it to happen?
   * Do you have any advice?",3,1754811885.0,AutisticAdults,0,1.0,False

We have been together over ten years. There have been ups and downs and we’ve really worked at it. She has had constant trouble with her self-esteem and we both suffer from trauma and PTSD. We were both a mess for a while (still working on it.) however some key things changed

She had a thyroidectomy because of cancer. I remember when we got the diagnosis, I was an absolute mess for months. It didn’t fully sink in her how serious this was. She considered not getting the surgery since she would have to be on pills for the rest of her life. Roughly ten more years she thought. We talked and she went through with it. I did research and did a deep dive into it. She wanted to avoid the pain, but it would have been so much worse if she didn’t get it.

She’s had lumps in her throat slowly growing over time for many years now. Doctors kept brushing it off until our newest Doc, who is a gem. I think when she got the surgery is likely the last time it would have gone well, since there was some complications from its growth.

They also said another side effect that could happen is that her personality could change. We were both worried about that, but her survival was ultimately more important.

Months go by and I help her recover. She seemed almost back to normal. Less patience, more frustrated. I figured she had cancer and is recovering, she’s allowed to be.

I’ve spent many nights talking to her about her intelligence and that people in the past have wronged her. She was strung along by an asshole and there was familial abuse, and she had a hard time with closure regarding that. I could never quite convince her that she was better than that. That she is a brilliant person. She would always fight me, and she’s the type that needed “proof”. I obviously wasn’t around when a lot of the bad stuff happened, but I listened. I met people involved. I did my diligence to figure stuff out.

Finally she ends up talking to ChatGPT and she has an epiphany. She tells me that I was right. That after explaining things to chat, it pretty much parroted what I had been telling. The big difference is that it used an itemized list to convince her and examples from her own text, etc. instantly a weight was lifted and we could talk openly about this. Something that was difficult for her.

I was ecstatic. She finally understood what I saw. That same night she laid something kinda heavy on me. That she wanted to spend her life supporting me. I forget the exact words, but it was a “we’re in it together” thing.

Now I work a lot. I have three jobs, two are part time, and I stream. I try to make time, but when we’re low on money, I get antsy. But I know I haven’t been as attentive. I’ve gotten better at being a partner but I still have work to do. (My last ex really screwed my brain up in what’s right or wrong.)

Shortly after, not even a few days, everything changed. She had been talking all the time with ChatGPT, near non-stop. She tells me she’s working on a story and wants me to read it. I read the wrong part, but it was a story about how she’s meets a new guy at a coffee shop and he’s her ideal man. A very pushy organized no nonsense person. (I am an ADHD silly man who finds joy in everyday life) in this story, this man helps her break up with me over the phone. Apparently I read a part I wasn’t supposed to read yet, she had me read a spot too early. But then it happened.

She doesn’t want to be with someone like me anymore and she thinks that I shouldn’t be with someone like her. She says she wants someone obsessed with her among other things, and that’s not me. She says she’s also done “being nice” to people. That her being cold and distant is her true self. She said that this will hurt but it’s ultimately for the best since she has now fallen out of love with me.

(The next day she went to a coffee shop and that was extremely upsetting. She’s normally someone grounded in logic so this was just confusing.)

We talked. Heck we even had sex a couple days later. It’s been a weird nebulous area.

Now I’m still here. We still live together but there’s a 50ft wall. She’s completely iced me out now. She is on her phone damn near 24/7.

I feel like shit. I feel like she broke up with me through ChatGPT. She encouraged me to talk to it as well and I tried. But this is still shitty. I know we had our problems, and that’s such a cliche line, but I thought we would work through it. We had worked through so much else together.

She said that we were two people that were really fucked up from PTSD and trauma that we latched onto each other like two people adrift at sea.  Now that we’re more mature we can see that we want different things.

I don’t want to say her personality has changed, but she is a lot colder. Maybe this is who she really is now.

I need to get out but I can’t afford to right now. It’s civil but it hurts. She is refusing to look at me, and when she does, it almost looks like disgust or disdain.

I’m just hurt. The fucking whiplash with the 180 on her feelings. I just want to leave but I can’t.",2,1754811870.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

1mmcgqs,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1mmcgqs/my_hunting_trip_went_completely_wronfmg/,my hunting trip went completely wronfmg,"I laid on my crouch after a long night at work, there was a news report on the tv talking about a couple who was mauled to death in some cabin. The police suspect a bear attack and warn nearby residents to lock their doors and not go out after dark. Luckily for me however I was nowhere near the area. After listening to the report I turned off the tv and went upstairs to sleep. I would need the rest for the long day of hunting.

I woke up around 8 in the morning to start my day, I brushed my teeth, grabbed my gear, drank my coffee and headed out. I headed towards a tree hideout I built so no bears would jump on me while I'm down there. I know they can climb pretty damn well but at least they won't know I'm up here. After I arrived at my hideout I loaded my 110 Hunter with some rounds and waited for a bit. After 30 minutes of nothing coming by I was hit with the realization that the woods were quiet. Usually these woods are filled with life, crickets chirping, frogs ribbiting in the nearby rivers but today, nothing. As soon as the unease kicked in, that's when I heard it.

 A distant loud screech coming from behind me on the ground, it damn near made me fall from the tree with how sudden it was. When i composed myself i crouched and went to check in between the gaps of the wooden railing i saw them, raptors, they had red feathers with their faces gray with a dark green around their eyes and a sickle like claw on each of their foots. I couldn't believe it, I was looking at 3 dinosaurs thought to be extinct for millions of years. I didn't know whether I should be amazed at what I was looking at or if I should be terrified at what I'm looking at. The big one in the middle, who I assume to be the alpha of this small pack, sniffed around the air when it paused. They looked around for a second when to my horror they looked at me in perfect unison.

My heart dropped when they did this, in fear I went to grab my rifle and when I returned, they were gone. Then to my left, I heard one of the raptors running, I heard the same thing to my right. They were circling me. I shot at one of them but as I expected I missed, the bastards were quick. But then I came to the realization they were just the distraction as I heard the ladder that led up here creaking. I ran over to the opening and shot the big one point blank at its head. Fear overcame me once more as the big one looked back up at me, both pissed off and unbothered by the bullet. I knew i was fucked if i stayed up there so as soon as it came up i jumped and ran like hell, i didnt dare check if the raptors were pursuing me but i knew they were as i heard the rapid footsteps approaching me. They randomly got in front of me as soon as I thought they had decided to leave me be, this continued until I reached a cliff. They cornered me, those damn devils planned this and I fell for their trap. 

I knew these would be my last moments before they tore me open and ate me alive, so I decided to reload my rifle and go down fighting. But before i could do this one of the raptors were dragged back by a big dog looking animal with large fangs and it bit down on the yelping raptors head and with one swift motion ripped its head off

I could see the other two were upset at this as they both charged at the creature. I took the opportunity to run but I stopped and looked back. This animal saved me. It was only fair that I helped it. I aimed my rifle at the big one's leg hoping it could give my saviour an advantage, I fired and to my surprise it screeched in pain giving my savior enough time to get the other raptor in its jaws, crushing its ribcage and ripping into its organs.the big one somehow was able to stand up and jump on the dog like being back. Its efforts were futile as my saviour caught the raptors tail in its jaws and bit into its throat.

 Knowing I helped my saviour I ran back into the woods hoping to find the trail back to my home. Not long later I found my house and immediately  went to my room and sat on my bed. I dont know how raptors were alive nor do i want to know. Thinking about it now they were too big to be normal raptors, maybe they were deinonychus or utahraptors. I may never know and I am at peace with that. Something that has been bothering me however, at night when its dark out i will hear the same screeching noise i heard when i first encountered them.

What gives?","I’m literally so confused. So I’m 24 and around 5 years ago i broke out due to the covid masks a fun possibly from weight gain but I started wearing sunscreen and went on tretinoin and it went away

It’s been fine up until about a year ago I have moved to another state and gotten married etc. and started breaking out. At first it wasnt so bad but the past year it was like new pimples just kept coming. I’ve seen much much worse from people who deal with acne so it isn’t like huge cysts but they are noticeable on my cheeks. Nothing was working. Tried tretinoin, tried benzoyl peroxide tried both, just irritated my skin doing that. Tried stopping them. Tried only washing once a day. Tried only doing one of them. I also tried DIM and didn’t make a difference. It’s also only on my cheeks/jawline so I thought it was hormonal. It was very noticeable . I’d try putting pimple patches. Nothing really worked

Then I tried keto for 3 weeks and it didn’t make it worse. It might’ve gotten slightly better but nothing crazy was still getting random pimple and would get bumps turn into pimples. 

Then after those 3 weeks (now), I go on vacation and stop keto and basically start eating like shit the past 5 days. Not  drinking enough water , lots coffee and food carbs dairy  and not rarely working out since on I’m vacation. And … my acne is starting to clear up after 5 days of being on vacation. Also, I had 2 pimples at the start of this trip that were not ready to pop and I popped them early and the next day they started healing.

All I’ve been doing is double cleansing with oil cleaner and regular cleanser (that I’ve been using anyways) and apply sunscreen, and tretinoin every other day or so. One thing I’ve been doing different the past week I’ve been cleansing more and would cleanse after popping a pimple and apply a pimple patch. And the environment here is not humid but where I live it is humid. I also started taking DIM a week ago but like I said I’ve tried it before and nothing.

I’m sorry I’m not understanding. I go on vacation, eat way worse, carbs, dairy, fat, workout less, less hydrated, all I do is cleanse, tretinoin every other day, pimple patch, and sunscreen and my face is clearing up after 5 days? Usually if I pop a pimple early, it makes everything worse but now I pop them early, they are inflamed for a day and the next day they started healing. 

Also before you say “maybe it’s your pillow cases or material” no because my husbands face is clear even with our current bed sheets and stuff and on top of that he dries his face with the same towel he dries his hands and arms with (I know it’s weird) but he used to have acne so it isn’t genetics either.

I just wanna keep this up because I’ve been dealing with this bs for a while now like for a year. And nothing is working and I don’t remember the last time I had glowy skin but now it’s starting to clear up .

Other than cleansing more I haven’t been doing anything much differently. But it’s confusing because then I hear that over cleansing is bad. Idk tbh I just wanna know how what to do when I go back home",1,1754810998.0,SkincareAddiction,2,1.0,False

1mmcbk8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mmcbk8,Sharing the pattern of my first wallet,"In 2018, I came across a YouTube video of someone handcrafting a leather wallet. Nothing special, but for some reason, it really hooked me. I decided to try it myself — working with scraps of leather I found at home, without proper tools, using whatever I could. I ordered the necessary materials, but couldn’t wait for them to arrive to start making real things.

Before working with the new leather I bought, I created paper prototypes. I spent hours measuring every line, folding and gluing, making sure all the seams matched perfectly. I tried to design my own wallet model instead of copying others. I experimented by creating visual mockups on my computer. Later, after many mistakes, I made my own cutting patterns, using specialized drafting software to achieve maximum accuracy.

By 2019, I finally made my first successful wallet. I rented a small workshop, bought professional leatherworking tools, and even a custom die-cut press. My plan was to make a batch of wallets in different colors, give them to friends, and see which designs they liked most.

I decided to add a fabric lining inside the wallet. This took a lot of time — I experimented with different glues and fabrics, and I enjoyed the process.

I also spent a huge amount of time creating visual content — photos, mockups, and product shots. I designed a logo and planned the packaging down to the smallest details, including the design of the box the wallet would come in. Ironically, all of that content was never published or used.

Then the pandemic hit. Just a month later, I had to stop. I sold only a few wallets, but it still meant a lot to know that someone was using something I made with my own hands.

Recently, I found my old patterns again. I decided to share them here — maybe someone will recreate this wallet or make it even better.

1mmcbc5,https://www.reddit.com/r/aistory/comments/1mmcbc5/the_swap/,The Swap,"We were born ten minutes apart, raised in the same house, and wore the same clothes until we were thirteen. We even shared a name for the first three years—our mother calling ""Daniel"" and expecting both of us to answer, her voice always rising in that gentle panic that only mothers can manage.

I became Daniel. My brother, Julian. He was better with numbers, steadier in his gait. I was better with faces, quicker with stories. We weren't identical, but we were indistinguishable to the people who didn’t know us.

At twenty-eight, we met for drinks one night in a nearly empty bar off Lenox Street, a place we'd never been and would never return to. We'd both come from different lives by then. I was living in Chicago, working as a high school history teacher and dealing with a divorce neither of us had the language to describe. He was a freelance web designer in Seattle, climbing, biking, dating artists and engineers, none of it serious.

“I’ve been thinking,” Julian said, nursing a beer he didn't like.

“God help us,” I replied.

“What if we swapped for a year? Lives. Jobs. Apartments. Friend circles. Everything.”

I laughed. “What’s the point?”

He shrugged. “To see if anyone notices. If we notice. I’ve always wondered what your life feels like, the inside of it. I want to wear it. Don’t you want to wear mine?”

It was such an absurd idea. And yet, like so many absurdities, it itched in the corner of my mind. The itch grew. Three weeks later, we signed matching notebooks and set a date.

Daniel’s Journal (Living as Julian)January 4I arrived in Seattle last night. Julian left me a list of passwords, a map of his favorite grocery store, and a warning about the neighbor’s cat, which apparently thinks this apartment is half hers. His couch smells like eucalyptus. His fridge has exactly four beers and a jar of olives. I already feel like an impostor, but his girlfriend—Alana—didn’t blink when I kissed her cheek and said, “Rough flight.” She curled into me like it was the most natural thing in the world. I felt like I was stealing.

Julian’s Journal (Living as Daniel)January 4Chicago is flatter than I remember. His apartment is too neat, the air stale with the quiet of a man who doesn’t talk to his walls. I met his colleague, Ms. Thatcher. She’s funny in that dry way, and she talks about Daniel like he’s some kind of reliable clock that keeps the whole school from falling apart. I fumbled my way through a lesson on the Treaty of Versailles. I think I called it the “Treaty of Vancouver” at one point. A kid asked me if I was okay. I said I hadn’t slept. He nodded like that explained everything. Maybe it did.

Daniel’s Journal March 12 Alana took me to a gallery opening. I met a woman named Summer who said I had “quieter eyes lately.” I told her I was trying to listen more. Apparently that’s something Julian never says. I wonder if I’m too serious. His friends are loose, loud, playful. They drink in colors and laugh in spirals. I try to keep up, but I think I’m the punctuation in their paragraphs—necessary, but easily overlooked.

Julian’s Journal March 13 I had dinner with Mom today. She didn’t say anything at first, just served shepherd's pie and tea. Then she said, “You’ve been walking differently.” I asked what she meant. She just smiled and said, “Julian always slouched. You’re standing taller now. Like something healed.” I didn’t know what to say to that. I never realized she paid that much attention to us. Or maybe she always knew.

Daniel’s Journal June 8 I saw Julian’s ex today. Her name is Clara, and she stopped by the apartment to return an old sweatshirt. I answered the door in my boxers. She blinked and said, “You’re not him, are you?” I stared at her. For a moment I thought it was over, the whole game. She stepped back and said, “You have his face, but not his pause. Julian always paused before he spoke.” She handed me the sweatshirt. “Tell him he’s not as clever as he thinks.”

Julian’s Journal June 8 I went on a date with a woman named Elaine. She works in the school office. She told me Daniel once cried in her cubicle after losing a student to a car accident last year. I didn’t know. I spent the whole date trying to think of what I would’ve done. I realized that I couldn’t even picture the boy’s face. That was Daniel’s grief, not mine. And yet I carried it with me the rest of the night, like a shadow that wasn’t mine but refused to leave.

Daniel’s Journal August 31 I sat on the rooftop last night, watching Seattle’s lights pulse like distant memories. Alana leaned into me and said, “I don’t know who you are, but I like him better.” I didn’t respond. I don’t think I’m Julian anymore. Not really. But I’m not who I was either. I’m someone new—some chimera made of both our lives.

Julian’s Journal August 31 I kissed someone last night. A teacher named Nora. It felt real. But it also felt like theft. I keep thinking about Daniel’s life—his books, his routines, the way he folds his shirts. He’s in love with structure the way I’m in love with motion. And yet… I like it here. I like the boy I’ve become.

On January 3rd, one year after that night in the bar, we met again—this time in Milwaukee, halfway between our borrowed lives. We sat at a quiet diner, drinking coffee and watching the snow build outside the windows.

“Well?” I asked.

He nodded. “People noticed.”

“But not everyone.”

“No,” he said. “Just the ones who mattered.”

We never returned to our old lives completely. Julian stayed in Chicago another year. I stayed in Seattle another two. We wrote less in our journals, talked more on the phone, and gradually, our voices became more our own.

In the end, the world didn’t fall apart. We weren’t exposed. But we became more than twins. We became, in some strange way, survivors of each other’s lives—carriers of secrets only we could decode.

There are a multitude of reasons why I quit the scene multiple times, and I'm just so fucking done with this game in the esports scene. 

First, the amount of commitment and dedication required to play this game at a high level. I used to be able to play 3 hours a day, 7 days a week, from 10-12 yo which is also where most of my competitive results came from. However, i had to quit in 6th grade because of my studies (I live in Singapore, education over everything blah blah blah). After i tried to get back into it, i was incredibly washed and after a terrible Riptide experience in 2023, I decided to quit again. Now, I have so many more commitments that I can barely play for 2 hours on week-ends. 

Secondly, the toxic nature and the disappointing conduct of the competitive player base. I used to be on a JP team because of lack of singapore competitive players and that experience was...not the best. As an 11-12 year old, I was bullied sometimes for my age as my teammates were 20+ yo. Additionally, I think many of you know about the Jackpot incident and the allegations about many top-level players being groomers etc. Being scared for my damn life as an Asian minor, this is one of the main reasons why i quit as a tween. 

Thirdly, the fact that many new and returning players probably can't keep up with the meta if they've taken a hiatus, which I have. For some stupid reason, I rejoined this year (this time with an NA team) to take part in the SWS qualifiers. Suffice to say we did not do well. I made some terrible picks (most notably thinking range blaster was still top tier) and just not playing well overall. as a minor note, the qualifiers took place at 1 AM singapore time so I also played on 5 cups of coffee per match. 

Last, the age (and my education). The playerbase is probably mostly made up of teens and tweens, correct? This is more personal for me but I don't know many players my age, so it was kind of hard to build connections especially at LANs and was hard to find teams. The only player my age i know is sam (great job at SWS btw). I am not willing to put school on the backburner for a video game and my parents don't really approve either.

1mmc9cp,https://www.reddit.com/r/aistory/comments/1mmc9cp/leakage/,Leakage,"I was eating hash browns at the Blue Plate Cafe when my third-grade teacher sat down across from me, smelling like chalk and Listerine, dead since 1989.

“You still cheat on math tests, Lester?” she asked, voice like erasers dragging across bone.

I said nothing. I chewed, and the grease pooled in my molars like motor oil. Outside, a dog with no skin barked at a parking meter. The waitress refilled my coffee and didn’t see her—only me and the black sludge swirling in the porcelain.

My name is Lester Grant, age fifty-two, occasional tax preparer, involuntary time-traveler of the internal. It started last Thursday when I pissed myself in the cereal aisle at Food King because I thought I was back in Nam, though I was never in Nam. My cousin was. Died in it, some say. Others say he sells hibachi grills in Tampa. Either way, that particular trauma wasn't mine—until it was.

Memories. Not just mine. Memories with cracked teeth and yellow film over the eyes. Memories stalking my apartment, lurking in coat closets, chewing through floorboards like hungry rats. They wanted something. Attention. Blood. Validation.

At night, my dreams were hacked like VHS cassettes left out in the rain. I’d wake up covered in sweat, the words “Go to the Basement” scratched into my skin in perfect Catholic-school cursive. That’s when I stopped sleeping. That’s when I started writing them down.

Fragment One:

I am five. The dog is licking peanut butter from my fingers. My mother is on the phone telling Aunt Clara that she’s thinking of ""doing it this time."" Doing what, exactly? No context. My father hums like a dead radio in the basement, wiring explosives into a television set, mumbling about Truman Capote.

Tuesday morning I found myself in a dentist’s chair. I hadn’t scheduled anything. My mouth full of broken pens. The hygienist wore my grandmother’s face. She whispered:

“Pain is a currency, dear. You’ve been saving up.”

Then she drilled through my molars straight into a memory I’d never lived:

A train station. Eastern Europe. 1943. Smoke and meat. I was crying in Yiddish and clutching a dead rabbit. I’m not Jewish, I thought. Not yet, said the rabbit.

I woke up on the bus, a woman slapping me with a takeout menu.

Fragment Two:

There’s a man—he’s me, but older or maybe younger. He is dissecting a baby doll with a fork and whispering lullabies backwards. I vomit moths and wake up screaming.

I went to see Dr. Lazo. Not a real doctor. Probably not a real Lazo. He worked out of a bookstore that sold only blank books. I told him I was losing track of time, that memories were hijacking me, hijacking reality like bad radio signals from a crooked tower.

“Your past,” he said, puffing clove smoke through a jade kazoo, “has unionized. They want better representation. They want you to listen.”

“But I am listening.”

“No,” he said, eyes glinting like mercury in old syringes, “you’re remembering. That’s different.”

He prescribed me a glass harmonica and a strict diet of expired zines. Said if I could play the harmonica in my sleep, the memories might form a congress and elect a spokesperson.

I asked him what happens if I fail.

“You'll fracture, Lester. You’ll become an anthology. No central narrator. No plot, just scenes. A Burroughs novel without the heroin.”

Fragment Three:

I am making love to someone I don’t recognize. She smells like lemon Pledge and sings old radio jingles in Polish. Her eyes are infinite. I dissolve into her pupils and find myself in a mid-’70s sitcom about a talking toilet who solves crimes. I am the toilet. My catchphrase is, “Flush the evidence.”

On the sixth day of memory insurgency, I found my childhood bike rusting in my bathtub. The tires screamed when I touched them. The faucet wept blue milk. The cockroaches spoke French and demanded rent.

I stood in the mirror and said:

“I am Lester Grant. I was born in El Paso. I like chili dogs and rainstorms and that feeling when you almost remember something.”

The mirror cracked and the voice said, “Not anymore.”

The memories got bolder. They wore me like a suit. I’d black out and come to in diners, on rooftops, in lovers’ beds I never remembered entering. Once, I came to in a police interrogation room with a spoon taped to my chest and a note pinned to my forehead:

“I remember you now.”

Dr. Lazo said I had one chance left: confront the Prime Memory. The First Cut. The Original Sin of Self.

“Find it,” he said, handing me a squirming reel of film, “splice it. Burn it. Or marry it. But you must acknowledge it.”

So I went to the basement. The real basement. The one beneath the others. Beneath the crawlspace of consciousness, where dust is made of dead names and forgotten phone numbers.

There, on a mildew-stained mattress, was a boy. Me. Eyes shut. Clutching something—an old birthday card. I knelt. I read it.

""To Lester. Sorry I missed the party. You’ll understand when you’re older. Love, Mom.""

The boy opened his eyes. They were mine. He smiled.

“You remember now,” he said.

“I do,” I whispered.

And suddenly, all the memories—mine and not—formed a line. A parade of ghosts. They clapped politely and bowed out of frame.

The lights came back on. I was back in my apartment. Just me, a harmonica, and a manuscript titled “Memories Demanding Attention: A Partial Autobiography.”

I played a single note.

It was enough.

It feels like 2025 is *the* year of the dog — and I’m not just talking about our four-legged best friends at home.  
From blockbuster movies to groundbreaking science, dogs are stealing the spotlight everywhere.

Here are a few trends making waves right now:

* **Krypto’s Big Screen Debut:** After the Superman movie, searches for “adopt dog near me” jumped by over 500%. Turns out one superhero pup can inspire thousands of adoptions.
* **Pet Tech Explosion:** Smart collars, health trackers, and even AI devices that claim to “translate” your dog’s barks are taking over the market.
* **A Pill to Extend Lifespan:** A biotech company just got FDA approval to test a drug that could help dogs live longer — release expected before the end of the year.
* **Mental Wellness for Dogs:** Puzzle feeders, scent games, and enrichment toys are more popular than ever for keeping pups sharp and happy.
* **Dogs in Our Daily Lives:** More workplaces, public spaces, and even coffee shops are going dog-friendly.

1mmc6u0,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1mmc6u0/fn_three_wishes/,[FN] Three Wishes.,"**People expect wishes to be loud.**  
They expect them to come from people clutching at hope with shaking hands, ready to demand something for themselves.

**Hiraya was not like that.**

She was fifteen when she found my lamp, buried in a thrift store bin.

When I appeared, she didn’t flinch — she just tilted her head slightly, as though she’d been expecting me.

“Three wishes, right?” she asked.

“Yes,” I told her. “Anything you want.”

But Hiraya didn’t answer right away.

That afternoon, she wandered the quiet streets of her town.

The air was crisp, heavy with the scent of damp earth and wood smoke from nearby chimneys.

She watched an old woman struggle with heavy groceries, her hands trembling just enough to betray the effort.

She saw children laughing by the fountain, their breath misting in the cool air, but one boy stood apart, his gaze lost in the fading amber light.

She listened — to the distant hum of voices, the soft shuffle of feet on worn pavement, the weight of things left unspoken.

After a long pause, she spoke.

“For my first wish… I want a bell.”

“But not just any bell.”

“I want it to ring only when someone needs help — and only the people strong enough to give the right help will hear it. Not just anyone. And not just for me… for everyone here.”

The next morning, she stood in the center of town with the silver bell I had given her,  
the kind of bell whose chime could melt the edge off winter air.

She tied it to the old wooden post, her fingers steady despite the bite of the cold.

A thin layer of frost glazed the post, glittering in the early sunlight.

It rang that night.

A boy heard it from his bedroom, the soft chime weaving through the quiet like a gentle call, and crossed the street to sit with his grieving neighbor.

The next week, it rang again, and a woman brought soup to a friend she hadn’t spoken to in months.

When Hiraya passed through the square the next day,  
she saw them smiling, standing close together, breath visible in the chilly morning air.

She smiled too.

Most days, someone heard the bell.

Some days, it rang for no one.

Weeks later, Hiraya sat by her window as the afternoon sun dipped low, spilling golden light across the wooden floor.

She watched neighbors pass without a word, their footsteps muffled on the cracked pavement, their eyes cast down, their silence heavy with things left unsaid.

The space between them felt thick — crowded with regret, fear, and the weight of truth they could not bear to voice.

She called me to her room.

Her desk lamp was the only light, flickering softly and casting long shadows under her tired eyes.

“For my second wish,” she said,

“I want a way for people to say what they truly feel, even when they can’t say it out loud.

If it’s honest and from the heart, it should find its way —  
a text from an unknown number, a note on a foggy window, an email from nowhere.

I want it to reach who it’s meant for, even if the sender is too afraid or too tired.”

“Again… for everyone?” I asked.

She nodded.

“For everyone.”

Two days later, the café buzzed with soft laughter and relief.

An old man clutched his phone, his knuckles white as he read a message from the daughter he thought had forgotten him.

Two women hugged by the window, the warm scent of coffee and cinnamon swirling around them, their argument dissolved by a note neither had the courage to write.

Hiraya sat in the corner with a cooling cup of tea, steam curling faintly above it, watching, and her lips curved in the faintest smile.

Her second wish stitched invisible threads between people who thought they’d been left behind.

When winter came, Hiraya stood beneath a cold, frozen sky late one night.

The stars above were pale and distant, the world hard and unforgiving.

She wrapped her arms around herself, the rough fabric of her sweater scratching against her skin, and thought about the cruelty people carried inside,  
the way hardship hardened hearts and numbed kindness.

She summoned me.

Frost patterned her window like delicate lace; the only sound in the room was the whisper of her blanket shifting as she sat on the edge of the bed.

“I want a space in everyone’s hearts that stays pure,” she said.

“Even if the world is cruel to them.  
A place where kindness and love can live, untouched.

I want it to be a safe place for their feelings, so the world can’t make them numb.”

I hesitated.

“That’s… a big gift. Why do you want that?”

She looked at me for a long moment, then back at the frost.

“Because people lose too much of themselves when it gets hard.

I don’t want them to lose this too.”

And that was all she said.

I granted it.

She sat in silence for a while, watching the frost crawl along the windowpane.

Then, without looking at me, she said softly,

“I’m sorry.”

“For what?” I asked.

“For being selfish,” she said.

“I could’ve used a wish to free you. But I didn’t.

I know that’s… not what a truly selfless person would’ve done.

I hope someday, someone better than me will do it.

Someone who deserves to meet you more than I did.”

She finally turned to me, and there was the smallest, tired smile.

“Thank you. For not twisting my wishes, and for granting them.”

She waved goodbye, a quiet smile on her face, and went on her way.

The bell still hangs in the town square, swaying gently when no wind blows.

It moves softly in the empty air—

It rings only for those who can help, and sometimes they come.

The unspoken words still find their way into trembling hands.

The quiet spaces in people’s hearts still glow, untouched by bitterness.

But none of it was ever for her.

No one heard the bell for her.

No letter found its way to her hands.

Whatever safe place she had in her own heart… wasn’t enough to keep her here.

Maybe she had already given up before she even met me.

Maybe she knew no one was strong enough to help her.

Maybe that’s why she never asked for herself.

I remember that night.

The bell swung gently in the cold night air.

It should have rung—for me, for her—

but it was silent.

No sound.

No help.

Her need hung in that silence, desperate and unseen.

And I, who grant wishes,

could do nothing.

That empty, unheard bell haunts me still.",3,1754810376.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False
1mmc6t5,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenDogTraining/comments/1mmc6t5/dog_pulling_on_leash_again/,Dog pulling on leash (again),"My dog is a one year old rescue that we got with 8 months. And despite it being his first time on a leash, her did learn pretty fast not too pull. He would still occasionally pull if it was an exciting area, like a market place, which we were trying to socialise him with.

If he was with my grandmother, he would sometimes pull until I taught her how to make it stop and it semi - worked (she spoils him and lets him get away with everything lol)

However, now we’re on vacation and it has gotten so much worse. He doesn’t just pull, he kinda runs, can’t run bc of the leash, jumps. If I stop (how I previously trained him) he’ll just go around to speed up and run even faster. It’s been kinda hard, although he is only a 12 kg dog, my grandmother can’t even walk him anymore.

He has his routine in our vacation home, where it’s the path to the forest to which he doesn’t pull until it’s time to get back. If we just go to another street, there he pulls once more. If I’m walking and a family members passes by, he starts pulling and won’t stop until we’re home again.

He is well socialised otherwise, we take him to the beach, to a coffee shop etc.. so I’m guessing it’s excitement but I want to stop it.

My previous training method: every time he pulled I would stop until he went to a loose leash and continue. It took a couple of weeks, and with a couple exceptions, he had great leash skills.",1,1754810373.0,OpenDogTraining,0,1.0,False

Earlier it used to clog up at anything below the 25 setting. So I reduced the shim washers from 6 to 2. Now, it grinds down to the number 10 setting, but it takes 2m30s to grind 18g between settings 10-15. And this isn’t very consistent, once it took over 5 mins. By the end of it, the burrs are quite hot, which I’m afraid is possibly harmful to the motor. Even grinding 30g for moka pot, at settings 20-25, takes 2-3 mins. I’ve tried the following:

Thorough cleaning, including removing the top grinder encasing and clearing out all the coffee grounds from everywhere possible.

I’ve tried WDT. In fact the burrs get so hot while grinding espresso, that when I use WDT, there’s a build up of condensed water vapour in the hopper after grinding.

I’ve even tried re-calibration by referring on Baratza’s instructional video on the same.

The only thing that helps remotely is having a hopper full of beans while grinding, giving me a somewhat consistent grind time of 2m30s at espresso settings. From what I’ve read, this time is still quite high. This also doesn’t work very well for me, as I prefer to weigh my coffee before grinding instead of using timed doses.

At this point I’m at a loss of what to do, and I’m considering getting a manual grinder for espresso, but the whole point of the ESP is that it’s supposed to be a grinder that can do it all.

I’m based in India, so there’s no Baratza support, and the companies that are doing Baratza support do not have service in my state.

If there’s something I can try to fix this issue, please let me know. If anyone knows a company that provides servicing and support for Baratza grinders in Northern India that would be much appreciated as well.

# Benefits Of Hot Protein Coffee

Hot protein coffee is more than just a morning pick-me-up. It’s a powerhouse beverage that combines the energizing effects of coffee with the muscle-building benefits of protein. Whether you’re an athlete, a busy professional, or someone looking to improve their health, hot protein coffee offers a range of benefits that can support your lifestyle. Have you ever thought about how a single cup can boost your day? Let’s dive into the benefits and discover why you might want to make this your go-to drink.

# Boosts Your Metabolism

Adding protein to your coffee can help increase your metabolism. Protein requires more energy to digest, which means your body burns more calories in the process. This can be particularly beneficial if you’re trying to manage your weight. Imagine sipping your coffee and knowing it’s working with your body to help you stay fit.

# Enhances Muscle Growth

Protein is essential for muscle repair and growth. Drinking hot protein coffee after a workout can provide your muscles with the nutrients they need to recover. It’s like a double shot of goodness—energy from coffee and strength from protein. Have you ever tried it as a post-gym treat?

# Keeps You Full Longer

Protein has the ability to make you feel fuller for longer periods. By adding it to your coffee, you can potentially reduce your hunger pangs throughout the day. This can help you avoid unnecessary snacking, which is often the culprit of unwanted weight gain. Is your current coffee doing that for you?

# Improves Mental Alertness

Coffee is well-known for its ability to enhance mental alertness, but adding protein can take it a step further. Protein provides sustained energy and can improve brain function. This means better focus and concentration without the crash. Next time you have a busy day, consider starting it with hot protein coffee.

# Offers A Convenient Nutrition Option

Hot protein coffee is a convenient way to add more nutrients to your diet without extra effort. It’s especially useful on busy mornings when you’re rushing out the door. You get your caffeine and protein fix in one easy-to-make drink. Why not make your morning routine simpler and healthier?

Hot protein coffee can be a game-changer in your daily routine. Whether it’s boosting your metabolism or keeping you full, the benefits are clear. So, are you ready to give it a try and see how it fits into your lifestyle?

# Choosing The Right Coffee

Choosing the right coffee is key to making delicious hot protein coffee. The flavor and aroma of coffee can enhance your protein drink. This section provides tips to select the perfect coffee for your brew. A good choice can elevate your morning routine.

# Understanding Coffee Types

Various coffee types exist, each with unique flavors. Arabica beans are popular for their smooth taste. They offer a mild flavor that pairs well with protein. Robusta beans are stronger and more bitter. They can overpower delicate flavors. Choose a type that matches your taste preference.

# Exploring Roast Levels

Coffee roast levels affect the flavor profile. Light roast coffees have a milder taste and higher acidity. They retain more original bean flavors. Medium roast offers a balanced taste, with subtle flavors. Dark roast provides a bold, smoky flavor. Choose a roast that complements your protein mix.

# Considering Coffee Grind

The grind size influences brewing time and flavor. Coarse grinds are best for slow brewing methods. They produce a mild flavor. Fine grinds are ideal for quick brewing. They release strong flavors fast. Ensure your grind matches your brewing method.

# Evaluating Coffee Freshness

Fresh coffee delivers the best taste. Check the roast date on the packaging. Fresher beans offer vibrant flavors and aromas. Store coffee in a cool, dry place. Use airtight containers to maintain freshness. Freshness enhances the overall coffee experience.

# Selecting Protein Powder

Choosing the right protein powder can transform your hot protein coffee. The type of protein powder impacts taste, texture, and nutritional benefits. Understanding different protein powder types helps you make the best choice for your beverage.

Tempered glass is substantially stronger than standard glass, making it more resistant to breakage and shattering. This is especially notable in a high-traffic area where accidental bumps and impacts are likely to occur. Tempered glass also shatters into small, relatively harmless pieces, reducing the risk of severe injury.**Sturdy Frame Construction:** The frame of a glass cocktail table provides the structural support and contributes to its overall stability.Common frame materials include stainless steel, chrome, wood, and metal alloys. Each material offers a different aesthetic and level of durability. For instance, stainless steel and chrome frames offer a sleek, modern look and are highly resistant to rust and corrosion, making them ideal for long-term use. Wooden frames can provide a warmer, more conventional feel but may require more maintenance to prevent damage from moisture or wear.

**Weight Capacity:** Always check the weight capacity of a glass cocktail table before making a purchase. This information is usually provided by the manufacturer and indicates the maximum weight the table can safely support without compromising its structural integrity. A higher weight capacity ensures that the table can accommodate various items, such as books, magazines, decorative objects, and even occasional seating. Overloading the table can lead to damage or even collapse, so it's crucial to adhere to the recommended weight limit.

**Adjustable Height and Leveling Feet:** Some glass cocktail tables come equipped with adjustable height mechanisms, allowing you to customize the table's height to suit your specific needs and preferences.This feature can be particularly useful if you have varying seating arrangements or if you want to use the table for different purposes, such as dining or working. Leveling feet are another valuable addition, as they allow you to compensate for uneven floors and ensure that the table remains stable and balanced.

Key features of the best glass cocktail tables in 2025 include:

* Durability with tempered glass
* Stylish and varied frame options
* Adequate weight capacity for everyday use

## Core Benefits

Choosing the right glass cocktail table can transform your living space by enhancing both its aesthetic appeal and functionality.

**Enhanced Aesthetic Appeal:** A glass cocktail table can significantly elevate the visual appeal of your living room. Its transparent surface creates a sense of openness and lightness, making the room feel larger and more airy. The reflective properties of glass also add a touch of sophistication and elegance, complementing a wide range of interior design styles, from modern and minimalist to contemporary and eclectic.

**Increased Functionality:** Glass cocktail tables offer more than just a surface to place drinks and snacks. They can also serve as a versatile platform for displaying decorative items, such as vases, sculptures, and coffee table books. Some models come with additional storage features, such as shelves or drawers, providing convenient space to organize magazines, remotes, and other living room essentials.

**Easy Maintenance and Cleaning:** glass surfaces are incredibly easy to clean and maintain. Spills and stains can be quickly wiped away with a damp cloth,and the non-porous nature of glass prevents the absorption of liquids and odors. This makes glass cocktail tables a practical choice for households with children or pets, where messes are more likely to occur.

**Are glass cocktail tables safe for households with children and pets?**

Cleaning a glass cocktail table is relatively simple. Use a soft, damp cloth to wipe away spills and stains as soon as they occur.

Regularly dust the table with a microfiber cloth to prevent the buildup of dirt and debris.

**What is the typical lifespan of a glass cocktail table?**
The lifespan of a glass cocktail table depends on several factors, including the quality of materials, the frequency of use, and the level of care provided. With proper maintenance and gentle use, a high-quality glass cocktail table can last for many years. Tempered glass and durable frame materials like stainless steel can significantly extend the table's lifespan.

I asked last week about the pasyalan spots in Tacloban, as I am from Manila. Here are some pics from the travel 😄 Tacloban is so nice, as well as Samar! Ang sarap ng binagol niyo! 🥥🤪

Big help with the Maxim tip, nagamit ko siya twice, and they were so quick to accept the ride. SANA ALL??!? Figaro outside Summit Hotel is also good! Nagbreakfast ako there on my first day, and for the remaining days of the stay, nagbreakfast na sa hotel. Sobrang accessible nung hotel, andaming good spots nearby.

Also tried the ihaw ihaw near Astrodome for dinner. Super cheap! Then, also went to Balay ni Romana in Sta. Rita. First time ko mag-try ng ensaladang talong and it's so fresh and refreshing pala! Sarap ng timpla nila. Daming iba't ibang luto ng fish which I loveee!!! I also visited the Astrodome as well as the park outside - mej eerie lang yung vibe.

Had some meal and coffee at Hotel Alejandro - very unusual ang vibes there, maybe because of the lights and the color, but the meal (their lechon?? 😚🤌🏻 FRENCH KISS!!), especially their latte, masarap so much!!

Sadly, hindi na nakavisit ng MacArthur park :(( but yeah, maybe on my next visit na lang?? 😄🩷 Thank you, Tacloban, and Samar! Beautiful places. Happy to know how you guys are thriving even after Haiyan. Stay beautiful. Salamat! xxx",26,1754810035.0,Tacloban,5,1.0,False

You told me that I always think about myself, that somehow the world revolves around me, and that I can’t seem to respect you or your need for time alone.

It’s just… that’s never been true.

Do you know that when I wake up and start my day, I always want to text you “good morning” first, but I don’t — because I know you’re still sleeping and I want you to rest?

Do you know that when I commute to work, I pray for both of us, and I hope you drive safely to wherever you’re going?

Do you know that when I make my coffee at work, I wish I could also make your tea and breakfast so you’d start your day feeling cared for?

Do you know that even when I’m buried in work and crunching numbers, I still find myself hoping you’re feeling productive too, so you won’t feel alone while I’m busy?

Do you know that when I take my lunch, I silently hope you’re eating something filling and healthy?

Do you know that when my day is ending, I’m also hoping you’re starting to wind down and prepare for a relaxing evening?

Do you know that I care so much about your mental well-being that I don’t mind if you forget to ask me how I’m doing — because what matters most to me is that you are happy and okay?

And honestly, I never wanted you to ask me about my day just for the sake of asking. My days have been peaceful ever since I started healing and walking this spiritual path. I’ve been living in contentment for a long time. The only reason I want you to ask is so we can connect on a deeper level — not just do surface-level check-ins.

I guess this is what it’s like to love someone strong and independent like me — I don’t need you, I just want you. And isn’t that so much more beautiful?

I’m sorry if all you see is an insecure little girl who’s just asking for your time and presence. Maybe you never really tried to know me — the real me.",0,1754809712.0,Unsent_Unread_Unheard,7,0.5,False

1mmc0ff,https://www.reddit.com/r/EntitledPeople/comments/1mmc0ff/cf_is_trying_to_act_like_things_never_happened/,CF is trying to act like things never happened,"Hey, y'all. It had certainly been a hot minute since I've updated you on the CF situation, so here's the update. Just a small recap for those of you who haven't read my previous posts on this total whack a doodle. 

I (30F. It was my birthday a week ago) and CF (55M) were once roommates in a very sketchy apartment complex and once I was forced to move into his unit, he started displaying some very questionable behaviors. Especially when my partner (35M) was around.

Well, things definitely took a very bad turn a few weeks after the incident with the casserole. Recently, a new person had moved in (28F). She was a bit shy and was hoping to break out of her shell a bit one night. She ordered pizza, set up a movie on Netflix, Nimona if I remember correctly, and asked my partner and I if we'd like to hang out with her.

We did and things were fun. The new roommate was really breaking out of her shell as we ate our pizza and watched the movie. She was really giggly and seemed really happy. This was well before 10, the time CF said we weren't allowed in the common area. Well, apparently CF had gone to bed a couple hours earlier than he usually claimed he did. It was around 8:00ish. 

He stormed out of his room and started screaming at us that we were making too much noise and that we were being inconsiderate. I could see the argument was getting way out of hand and was starting to have a bit of a panic attack witnessing this. I went to my bedroom, locked the door and tried to pretend the argument wasn't happening.

It was super scary. My partner and the new roommate were trying to calm him down. They tried to ask him how they were even supposed to know he was in bed. It was was well before the time he claimed he normally went to bed at. But he wasn't even having it and he kept screaming loudly at them. He even started claiming he would hurt them if they didn't stop making noise.

The argument got so loud that police were called and he got taken out of the apartment and put into a mental hospital for like a week. It was freaking scary and ridiculous. My partner claims to have gotten PTSD from this argument. 

Well, months after this happened, I was at work as my partner was grabbing a coffee at this local café. This story was second hand so I don't know how accurate this is.

Obviously we're not friends with him anymore. The fact he treated us like absolute garbage for a few months definitely burned that bridge. CF even said we weren't friends anymore. Well, my partner's pet cat had passed away a few months prior and he was having a good cry about it. Pets are family and losing family is never easy.

CF came into the café with his service dog and noticed that my partner was crying. He walked up to my partner and asked him if he was okay. He was acting as if his horrible treatment of us didn't happen.

My partner gave a quick "" Yes. I'm fine."" and then went back to drinking his coffee. CF then went to a table, erratically waving his arms around and ranting about how my partner was apparently being rude. Well, my partner and I obviously don't trust him so did he really expect anything more?",3,1754809689.0,EntitledPeople,2,0.8,False
1mmc0dg,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1mmc0dg/i_just_dont_feel_connected_with_people_and/,I just don’t feel connected with people and humanity,"I have a very hard time connecting with people, like people say I’m friendly and easy to get along with (although I am often described as “blunt” and kind of harsh, so make of that what you will) but it kind of takes me a while to have a feeling of them being a person in the way that I am a person, then after that I often don’t know what level of commitment I am expected to have and I don’t really have an emotional sense of my friendship with them, like I care about them and I would be sad if they left but other people seem to have some inherent sense of our friendship. Also before I feel some sense of friendship it’s far too easy for me to not care about offending them and in the past I would kind of start arguments for entertainment without care for how it effected them but I also didn’t understand how much it affected them because I didn’t understand they care about my opinion of them and their beliefs, values, and knowledge. 

I’ve had multiple friends that seemed almost worried about me when they found out I wasn’t sure if they actually cared about me or not. I feel like to me a lot of it looks the same so I learned to just not care too much. 
At one point my friend referred to me as being a close friend and I mentioned not knowing that she felt that way and she said something like “We’ve been meeting for coffee and talking about all the details of our lives for 3 years… and you were at my wedding…” which yeah when it’s out that way I can see it. After that conversation and letting her perspective sink in I did start to feel more of a bond and trust. 
I experienced a similar interaction more recently and the pattern became more obvious.

I also just don’t feel the same as the rest of humanity. It feels like I’ve seen the darkest sides of so many people and seen the systemic abuse, it’s hard for me to feel like we’re even the same creature despite being far too aware of those human behaviors in me, I just feel very disconnected from my own sense of being human. Sometimes I meet people and it’s like I can see some aspect of myself in them but it’s often not exactly a good think, equally sometimes I encounter people that my mind just immediately registers as being fake and predatory because they have a lot of the same dangerous behaviors as people of my past. 

Sorry for such a long post. I’m just not sure if this is somehow a result of my BPD or what exactly it is. 
I have another a full psychological evaluation coming up which also includes an in depth autism evaluation and checking how my BPD is doing. My psychologist and therapist have said I am kind of a unique case and also expressed concern about how I view people and feel separate from them (they used polite and professional wording) ",2,1754809682.0,BPD,0,1.0,False

There are a multitude of reasons why I quit the scene multiple times, and I'm just so fucking done with this game in the esports scene. 

First, the amount of commitment and dedication required to play this game at a high level. I used to be able to play 3 hours a day, 7 days a week, from 10-12 yo which is also where most of my competitive results came from. However, i had to quit in 6th grade because of my studies (I live in Singapore, education over everything blah blah blah). After i tried to get back into it, i was incredibly washed and after a terrible Riptide experience in 2023, I decided to quit again. Now, I have so many more commitments that I can barely play for 2 hours on week-ends. 

Secondly, the toxic nature and the disappointing conduct of the competitive player base. I used to be on a JP team because of lack of singapore competitive players and that experience was...not the best. As an 11-12 year old, I was bullied sometimes for my age as my teammates were 20+ yo. Additionally, I think many of you know about the Jackpot incident and the allegations about many top-level players being groomers etc. Being scared for my damn life as an Asian minor, this is one of the main reasons why i quit as a tween. 

Thirdly, the fact that many new and returning players probably can't keep up with the meta if they've taken a hiatus, which I have. For some stupid reason, I rejoined this year (this time with an NA team) to take part in the SWS qualifiers. Suffice to say we did not do well. I made some terrible picks (most notably thinking range blaster was still top tier) and just not playing well overall. as a minor note, the qualifiers took place at 1 AM singapore time so I also played on 5 cups of coffee per match. 

Last, the age (and my education). The playerbase is probably mostly made up of teens and tweens, correct? This is more personal for me but I don't know many players my age, so it was kind of hard to build connections especially at LANs and was hard to find teams. The only player my age i know is sam (great job at SWS btw). I am not willing to put school on the backburner for a video game and my parents don't really approve either.

You told me that I always think about myself, that somehow the world revolves around me, and that I can’t seem to respect you or your need for time alone.

It’s just… that’s never been true.

Do you know that when I wake up and start my day, I always want to text you “good morning” first, but I don’t — because I know you’re still sleeping and I want you to rest?

Do you know that when I commute to work, I pray for both of us, and I hope you drive safely to wherever you’re going?

Do you know that when I make my coffee at work, I wish I could also make your tea and breakfast so you’d start your day feeling cared for?

Do you know that even when I’m buried in work and crunching numbers, I still find myself hoping you’re feeling productive too, so you won’t feel alone while I’m busy?

Do you know that when I take my lunch, I silently hope you’re eating something filling and healthy?

Do you know that when my day is ending, I’m also hoping you’re starting to wind down and prepare for a relaxing evening?

Do you know that I care so much about your mental well-being that I don’t mind if you forget to ask me how I’m doing — because what matters most to me is that you are happy and okay?

And honestly, I never wanted you to ask me about my day just for the sake of asking. My days have been peaceful ever since I started healing and walking this spiritual path. I’ve been living in contentment for a long time. The only reason I want you to ask is so we can connect on a deeper level — not just do surface-level check-ins.

I guess this is what it’s like to love someone strong and independent like me — I don’t need you, I just want you. And isn’t that so much more beautiful?

I’m sorry if all you see is an insecure little girl who’s just asking for your time and presence. Maybe you never really tried to know me — the real me.",1,1754808946.0,letters,1,1.0,False

1mmbskc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Constipation/comments/1mmbskc/help_zofran_constipation/,Help - zofran constipation,"so, basically as the title states. I've been constipated for a little over a week. Now, constipation isn't new to me. I have had stomach issues my entire life. 

However this week is slightly different. I started going through inpatient ED recovery so my diet habits have changed drastically, on top of taking zofran for a week straight to help with digestion nausea. (Twice as day as directed by my providers). [note the longest stretch I have ever taken zofran in the past is max 3 days due to constipation.]

I literally do not know what to do. I've tried miralax, prune/pear juice, exercises, massage, milk of magnesia, and I'm seriously considering an enema. My previous experiences haven't felt like this, it's mostly that I don't go and when I take laxatives it moves things along pretty smoothly. This time is not that. I get the urge to go, and I can feel it there, and it hurts physically, but I literally cannot get it to actually come out. I just feel it painfully stuck. Doesn't matter if I relax, push, even sit like an ape. 
I'm also terrified of the nausea, and the last time I tried to get it to move I got so nauseated and was just violently shaking trying to go. It wasn't getting anywhere. Never have I ever shook because of something like that lol. 

Any tips? I'm at the hospital enough for treatment, so I really want to avoid the ER if possible, and part of my treatment is no coffee/caffeine. (Sucks, I know!) Thank you!! ",1,1754808894.0,Constipation,0,1.0,False

I already helped the wife move out and it was my first day alone. BTW I never cheated in our 13 years.

I was starving and it was 3PM (doing my move all day) so I decided to get some ramen, and saw a beer garden across the street. I bring my food in and decide I’m going to flirt with any and all women that come in regardless of age or whether I think they’re hot.

I am flirting with this pastor chick and then like a 70yo.

This 50yo comes along and tells me about the secret smoking room they got in the back and I was like hell yeah!

She tries to sell me some paintings she has in a coffee shop and I tell her I’m rich and shit and I’ll buy it. (I actually am kinda rich till my wife gets half).

She tells me she’s moving to Florida in a few days and then I’m like hey we should get a taco. And then I whisper into her ear about how I really really like tacos. And a bunch of other non subtle things:)

We eat some food and then we get into her Oldsmobile and drive up to my old place. She cracks open one of those Buzz ballz in the car, LOL.

We get up there and the place is a total flop house. Garbage and boxes everywhere, single bare mattress on the floor.

We smoke weed out of an apple (no rolling papers and she’s a Macguyver, apparently). Most importantly we do the deed and it’s raunchy and awesome.

She was kind enough to leave at the end of the night but she left her phone and a bunch of other shit.

Anyway I find her email on linked in and remind her of my address. She shows up at 11 the next day and reminds me of that promise to buy the painting because she really needs the rent money for Florida.

So we drive down to the coffee shop I Venmo her and she drives me home. The painting is actually pretty extraordinary and, if she comes by, I will have to ask my wife what she thinks about my new interest in local art.

I feel like a whore but also feel really good.

Go get yours guys and keep your heads up.

I tried sodium bicarbonate to remove any build-up of coffee oils and vinegar for limescale…both to no effect.  I’m left thinking that the plastic has deformed due to contact with hot water.

By being a bit more careful with plunger placement I can still get a good seal so the AP still works.

I was hoping someone could tell me if I'm on the right track or if I need to do more research. Please be nice, this is a new subject for me. 😜
  It's a standard travel trailer with LED lights, pumps and furnace. We have 2 CPAP pilot-24 lites that need to be charged daily etc. My calculations say I need 252ah/day. That's on the true high end of that calculation. We get about 2Peak Sun hours in the later season and 4 during summer if we park in the sun, which is not always the case. It rains here a lot and we have massive tree cover at many campgrounds. We like to camp off grid about 3+days at a time and go for 1 large trip, 10-14 days with a night or 2 with service to fill/empty tanks, each summer. 

  Here is my thoughts, please tell me yours:
 600W(or should I do 800, is this overkill?!) solar on the roof ( this would be flat mounted so not ideal, but safe and secure.
  2000W pure sine inverter (for CPAP batteries and possible coffee maker on occassion. I'm high maintenance. 😅
   2x 280ah LiFepo4 batteries w/Bluetooth and cold protection.

   Is that a good start? What would you change? Should I wire them to a 24v system or keep it 12v?  That will change the mppt  controller that I get.

# white Lightning Drink: 2025 Best Brands & Expert Review

The ""white lightning"" category of beverages has historically referred to potent, unaged spirits, frequently enough associated wiht moonshine or illicitly produced alcohol. however, in the modern context, particularly with the rise of ready-to-drink (RTD) alcoholic beverages and energy drinks, ""white lightning"" has taken on new meanings. Today, the term might evoke images of high-caffeine energy drinks or powerfully flavored, clear-colored alcoholic cocktails. Understanding this evolution and the varying interpretations of ""white lightning"" is crucial for consumers seeking specific experiences or products. This review will analyze the best brands and offerings that fit within the contemporary understanding of ""white lightning"" drinks for 2025, considering both energy and alcoholic formulations.

This variation caters to diverse consumer needs, with those looking for a mild pick-me-up opting for the lower end, while individuals requiring a more significant energy boost prefer the higher concentration. For alcoholic versions, the focus shifts away from caffeine, with some brands incorporating minimal amounts for flavor enhancement rather than energy stimulation. Detailed labeling and accurate data on caffeine content are critical for responsible consumption.

**Flavor Profile:** The intensity and uniqueness of the flavor play a pivotal role in the appeal of each brand. ""White lightning"" drinks often aim for bold, refreshing, or even unconventional taste experiences.

The Flavor profiles associated with the 'White Lightning' name tend to be intense and often artificially flavored to deliver a satisfying punch. Energy drinks frequently enough utilize a blend of citrus, berry, or tropical fruit flavors designed to both invigorate the senses and mask the underlying taste of the ingredients. Premium alcoholic variations might feature elegant combinations of natural fruits,subtle botanicals,or carefully crafted distillates for a more refined sipping experience. The overall goal is to provide a distinct and memorable taste that sets the product apart from standard offerings in the beverage market.

**Sugar Content/Sweeteners:** Given growing health consciousness, the type and amount of sweeteners used is a key consideration, influencing both taste and perceived product healthiness.

The Sugar content, or lack thereof, is becoming increasingly important for consumers evaluating ""white lightning"" drinks. Many modern formulations are shifting towards sugar-free or low-sugar options, incorporating artificial sweeteners like sucralose, aspartame, or stevia to maintain a desired sweetness level without the caloric drawbacks. Though, some consumers still prefer traditionally sweetened beverages, finding the taste superior or the artificial aftertaste undesirable.Therefore, a balance between sweetness, caloric impact, and the type of sweetener used is becoming a crucial differentiator across brands.**Ingredients & Additives:** Consumers are increasingly interested in the specific ingredients used, particularly the presence of natural extracts, vitamins, or other functional additives, particularly for energy-focused beverages.

The Ingredients and additives in ""white lightning"" drink variations will naturally differ depending on the category. Energy drinks frequently enough contain a range of ingredients purported to enhance mental focus, physical performance, or overall well-being, such as the B vitamins, taurine, guarana, ginseng, or L-carnitine. Alcoholic versions tend to focus on the quality and provenance of the alcohol base (e.g., vodka, rum, or tequila), along with natural fruit extracts, botanicals, or flavorings. Transparency in ingredient sourcing and clear labeling are increasingly valued by consumers seeking to make informed choices about what they consume.

By President Javier Gerardo Milei

1. Introduction

Since mid-April, when the foreign exchange market was liberalized, monetary debate in Argentina has revolved around what the behavior of the U.S. dollar should be and the pass-through to prices in the event that the currency appreciates. Beyond the fact that the vast majority of analysts—except for a small handful (and the economic team)—have been wildly off in their forecasts, what is most striking is the persistence of the same analytical errors that have kept these professionals in a losing streak even before the change of government. This behavior is understandable in an insular environment, especially when there is no cost for being wrong if everyone else was also wrong—particularly under the logic of the Oracle of Delphi, which offered advice but never made decisions.

In short, what I wish to point out is that, even though everyone speaks of the price pass-through of movements in the exchange rate, this assertion—although allegedly supported by “empirical evidence”—is false and reveals a deep misunderstanding of monetary theory.

2. Origin and Nature of Money

To understand the nature of money, we must first internalize how an economy without money would function—namely, a barter economy. In a pure exchange economy, individuals meet their needs by trading with others: in exchange for goods they are willing to offer, they receive goods offered by another individual. While this may seem simple, the process runs up against two immediate problems.

First, there is the problem of the double coincidence of wants: it is necessary to find a pair of individuals whose needs are mutually compatible—in other words, the person seeking a given good must find not only someone willing to sell it, but that same person must also be willing to accept in exchange the good that the first person offers. Second, there is the problem of indivisibility: even when the double coincidence is met, the goods involved may not be divisible into the proportions necessary for a transaction (for example, I may wish to buy bread, and the baker may wish to hear one of my economics lectures; however, the minutes and content I am willing to trade for a loaf of bread may be of no practical use to the baker in making his decisions).

Faced with this challenge, human beings did not sit idly by waiting for someone else to solve the problem. They observed that some goods were exchanged more frequently than others, and thus discovered indirect exchange—a good not purchased for direct consumption but for the purpose of facilitating further exchanges. This process led to the emergence of commodity money. The earliest forms of money included cattle, linen, salt, tobacco, coffee, and, more recently in history, cigarettes in prisons.

While these goods met two basic conditions for functioning as money—serving as a unit of account and a generalized medium of exchange—they failed in their role as a store of value. Being perishable, their storage implied a negative interest rate, as their value would decline over time. This led to the adoption of metallic money. However, it too was not without problems: issues of portability arose, as did the risks of transporting large amounts of precious metals. This led to the development of deposit certificates, enabling individuals to carry less physical weight. Inevitably, fraud emerged, with deposit houses issuing unbacked certificates in their own favor. The state then intervened—not to restore order—but to monopolize the issuance of money, impose legal tender, and thus perfect the expropriation. The rest is well-known history.

3. The Monetary Nature of Inflation

In light of the previous point, it should be clear that money is nothing more than a good used for indirect exchange, serving solely to facilitate transactions—whether present (transactional demand) or future (hoarding). Thus, the demand for money is derived from the overall demand for goods and services in the economy; in simpler terms, it is a mirror demand.

From this perspective, money demand is determined by the intertemporal consumption vector and its functional relationship is defined by the parameters that shape this vector. In the same way that consumption is determined, money demand depends on the intertemporal price vector. In terms of general equilibrium, this reveals the error of economists who formulate money demand as a function of income (derived from selling labor in the market plus returns on business ownership) and the interest rate (implicit in the intertemporal price vector, as it is the relative price of present goods to future goods). Determining the equilibrium price vector requires what Robert Lucas Jr. called “deep parameters”: (i) preferences, (ii) technology, and (iii) endowments. If money exists, the monetary base must also be included, along with consideration of the institutional structure of property rights (though we simplify here by assuming a private property economy).

If money demand is determined by the consumption path, which itself depends on prices, and prices are determined by deep parameters, then real money demand under normal conditions is a fixed function. In equilibrium, it must equal the real money supply (money = monetary base divided by the price level). This leads to the conclusion that inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon, generated by an excess money supply—whether from an increase in supply and/or a fall in demand—which results in a loss of purchasing power, i.e., all prices expressed in monetary units rise.


4. The Hume–Cantillon Effect: The Empirical Mirage of the Pass-Through Fallacy

While the conclusion above is decisive and fundamental for the design of a serious monetary policy aimed at eradicating inflation, it also requires patience. Monetary policy does not operate instantaneously; it works with lags. In Argentina’s case, this lag ranges from 18 to 24 months. That is, even if the printing press were halted on day one, the country would still have to endure the purgatory of inflation for at least a year and a half. Given that the first phase of rebuilding the Central Bank’s balance sheet required six months before the printing press could be shut down, we anticipate that by mid-2026 inflation will be nothing more than a bitter memory for Argentines.

However, the inflationary purgatory may require additional time and/or higher rates of inflation if there is a monetary overhang. This phenomenon typically emerges under price controls and capital controls. In the first case, it manifests as shortages; in the second, as exchange rate gaps and the depletion of the Central Bank’s reserves. Moreover, capital controls artificially increase money demand, thereby expanding the tax base for the inflation tax and exacerbating the state’s expropriation.

As the months pass after the initial injection of money, the Hume–Cantillon effect takes place. This effect originally described the distributive consequences of money entering the economy: those who receive and spend it first (politicians) conduct transactions with today’s money and yesterday’s prices, to the detriment of those who receive the money later in the chain. The counterpart is that prices do not rise simultaneously; some adjust first, others later.

Astonishingly, even for pass-through fundamentalists, the most popular model for open economies with money is Rudiger Dornbusch’s overshooting model. In this framework, an excess money supply produces an exchange rate jump greater than the rate of devaluation implied by the monetary expansion rate consistent with Purchasing Power Parity (PPP). Once goods market adjustments occur and exportable surpluses increase, the exchange rate falls back toward the PPP level. Economists often parrot these terms without realizing that behind them lies the Hume–Cantillon effect: the goods market adjusts slowly, while the financial market adjusts instantly. Thus, when an excess money supply is created, individuals rush to the financial market to buy foreign currency, while foreign currency generation is slow—hence the disproportionate initial jump in the exchange rate, which later recedes as markets equilibrate. In other words, it is meaningless to speak of pass-through, since prices will inevitably converge toward PPP.

Following this logic, when an excess money supply translates into excess demand in the foreign exchange market, the U.S. dollar—as a financial asset—rises first; next come tradable goods prices, then wholesale prices, then retail prices, and finally wages (hence the political unpopularity of devaluation). Ultimately, the causal relationship still runs from money quantity to prices, and this sequence explains the empirical evidence that some use to justify the pass-through concept. However, speaking of pass-through is equivalent to employing poor-quality economic theory, since it assumes a causal relationship from exchange rates to the price level, which rests on an objective theory of value. This approach was already superseded in 1871 by Carl Menger’s Principles of Economics, developed in parallel with William Stanley Jevons and Léon Walras.

For those unconvinced by the Hume–Cantillon or value theory arguments, a general equilibrium argument can be offered. In a complete general equilibrium model, the excess demand functions for each of the n goods in the economy depend on the n prices. Including the money market as described earlier yields a system of n+1 homogeneous equations of degree zero (i.e., dependent on relative prices). Taking money as the numeraire, Walras’s Law tells us that if n markets are in equilibrium, the remaining one will be as well, allowing the determination of n relative prices—expressed in money, these are monetary prices. Exogenous variables in this system include preferences, technology, endowments, and the money supply. The pass-through idea encounters a logical inconsistency here: in a general equilibrium system, the foreign currency price is endogenous, yet many local economists treat it as exogenous while claiming it determines all other prices. If they truly used general equilibrium models, as they claim, pass-through could not exist—since that would require the foreign currency price to be simultaneously endogenous and exogenous. Logical inconsistency detected. End of debate.

5. Final Reflections: Menger Is Watching

Throughout this analysis, we have demonstrated a set of concepts in monetary theory that are essential to correctly analyzing and understanding the policy conducted by the Central Bank of the Argentine Republic (BCRA). First, we derived money demand as a demand derived from the goods market. Building on this, we demonstrated the monetary nature of inflation and, in light of this, showed the theoretical invalidity of the pass-through concept, while clarifying that its apparent empirical strength is nothing more than a statistical mirage, resolved within the framework of the monetary theory of inflation once the Hume–Cantillon effect is considered.

Finally, in light of the subjective theory of value, one further reflection arises based on Menger’s principle of imputation. In this theory—as opposed to the objective theory, where costs determine prices—the principle of imputation holds that prices determine costs, and prices themselves are determined by preferences, scarcity (technology and endowments), location, and time.

Based on this, suppose we have two goods, A and B. If, for some reason, demand for A rises at the expense of B, the relative price of A to B must rise—A’s price will increase while B’s price will fall. Consequently, spending on A will increase, while spending on B will fall, pushing B’s price further downward. Now, if the Central Bank intervenes to prevent B’s price from falling—fearing a decline in economic activity—it will issue money such that B’s price remains unchanged, but this will cause A’s price to rise more than proportionally until reaching the new equilibrium relative price. Thus, inflation requires monetary accommodation by the Central Bank.

In other words, without monetary accommodation, the price level will not change; all that occurs is a shift in relative prices. Moreover, if sellers of B attempt to raise prices after A’s price has risen, they will find—per Menger’s principle of imputation—that they cannot sell their products, their warehouses will fill with unsold inventory, asset turnover will slow, and returns will be destroyed. Sooner or later, unless they are masochists, they will learn. Now, replace “good A” with “U.S. dollar” and “good B” with “all other goods.” The story tells itself: changes in relative prices without monetary accommodation do not generate inflation.

Why, then, do people persist in believing that a rising dollar causes prices to rise? Simply because this has been the case for the last 90 years. Except during the Convertibility period, whenever the dollar rose, prices followed; during Convertibility, with a fixed exchange rate, there was no inflation. Thus, someone untrained in monetary economics may be misled by this spurious correlation—just as one might believe that people wearing swimsuits cause summer to arrive. However, one would expect that someone with at least four or five years of economic studies, possibly postgraduate, doctoral, or postdoctoral training, and many years of professional experience would avoid such amateur errors—errors easily corrected by including money supply variation in the analysis.

In Argentina’s case, given the political caste’s addiction to fiscal deficits, it is not only possible to explain the repeated episodes of default, tax hikes, and monetary issuance—which, in the latter case, has generated inflationary disaster—but also to understand that this process has destroyed five currencies and lopped thirteen zeros off the national currency. For the sake of Argentines, I hope the lesson is learned.

Let's shake it up a little. Barry! Breakfast is ready! Ooming! Hang on a second. Hello? - Barry? - Adam? - Oan you believe this is happening? - I can't. I'll pick you up. Looking sharp. Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those. Sorry. I'm excited. Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son. A perfect report card, all B's. Very proud. Ma! I got a thing going here. - You got lint on your fuzz. - Ow! That's me! - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye! Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house! - Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry. - Is that fuzz gel? - A little. Special day, graduation. Never thought I'd make it. Three days grade school, three days high school. Those were awkward. Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive. You did come back different. - Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. - Hear about Frankie? - Yeah. - You going to the funeral? - No, I'm not going. Everybody knows, sting someone, you die. Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead. I guess he could have just gotten out of the way. I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day. That's why we don't need vacations. Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances. - Well, Adam, today we are men. - We are! - Bee-men. - Amen! Hallelujah! Students, faculty, distinguished bees, please welcome Dean Buzzwell. Welcome, New Hive Oity graduating class of... ...9:15. That concludes our ceremonies. And begins your career at Honex Industries! Will we pick ourjob today? I heard it's just orientation. Heads up! Here we go. Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times. - Wonder what it'll be like? - A little scary. Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group. This is it! Wow. Wow. We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life. Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive. Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... Honey! - That girl was hot. - She's my cousin! - She is? - Yes, we're all cousins. - Right. You're right. - At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence. These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology. - What do you think he makes? - Not enough. Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman. - What does that do? - Oatches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions. Oan anyone work on the Krelman? Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot. But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life. The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that. What's the difference? You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years. So you'll just work us to death? We'll sure try. Wow! That blew my mind! ""What's the difference?"" How can you say that? One job forever? That's an insane choice to have to make. I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life. But, Adam, how could they never have told us that? Why would you question anything? We're bees. We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth. You ever think maybe things work a little too well here? Like what? Give me one example. I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about. Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach. Wait a second. Oheck it out. - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks! - Wow. I've never seen them this close. They know what it's like outside the hive. Yeah, but some don't come back. - Hey, Jocks! - Hi, Jocks! You guys did great! You're monsters! You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it! - I wonder where they were. - I don't know. Their day's not planned. Outside the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what. You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that. Right. Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime. It's just a status symbol. Bees make too much of it. Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it. Those ladies? Aren't they our cousins too? Distant. Distant. Look at these two. - Oouple of Hive Harrys. - Let's have fun with them. It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock. Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom! He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me! - Oh, my! - I never thought I'd knock him out. What were you doing during this? Trying to alert the authorities. I can autograph that. A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades? Yeah. Gusty. We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow. - Six miles, huh? - Barry! A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it. - Maybe I am. - You are not! We're going 0900 at J-Gate. What do you think, buzzy-boy? Are you bee enough? I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means. Hey, Honex! Dad, you surprised me. You decide what you're interested in? - Well, there's a lot of choices. - But you only get one. Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day? Son, let me tell you about stirring. You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around. You get yourself into a rhythm. It's a beautiful thing. You know, Dad, the more I think about it, maybe the honey field just isn't right for me. You were thinking of what, making balloon animals? That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger. Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey! - Barry, you are so funny sometimes. - I'm not trying to be funny. You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer! - You're gonna be a stirrer? - No one's listening to me! Wait till you see the sticks I have. I could say anything right now. I'm gonna get an ant tattoo! Let's open some honey and celebrate! Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody ""dawg""! I'm so proud. - We're starting work today! - Today's the day. Oome on! All the good jobs will be gone. Yeah, right. Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal... - Is it still available? - Hang on. Two left! One of them's yours! Oongratulations! Step to the side. - What'd you get? - Picking crud out. Stellar! Wow! Oouple of newbies? Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready! Make your choice. - You want to go first? - No, you go. Oh, my. What's available? Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think. - Any chance of getting the Krelman? - Sure, you're on. I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out. Wax monkey's always open. The Krelman opened up again. What happened? A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one. Deady. Deadified. Two more dead. Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life! Oh, this is so hard! Heating, cooling, stunt bee, pourer, stirrer, humming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator, stripe supervisor, mite wrangler. Barry, what do you think I should... Barry? Barry! All right, we've got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine... What happened to you? Where are you? - I'm going out. - Out? Out where? - Out there. - Oh, no! I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life. You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello? Another call coming in. If anyone's feeling brave, there's a Korean deli on 83rd that gets their roses today. Hey, guys. - Look at that. - Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday? Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted. It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up. Really? Feeling lucky, are you? Sign here, here. Just initial that. - Thank you. - OK. You got a rain advisory today, and as you all know, bees cannot fly in rain. So be careful. As always, watch your brooms, hockey sticks, dogs, birds, bears and bats. Also, I got a couple of reports of root beer being poured on us. Murphy's in a home because of it, babbling like a cicada! - That's awful. - And a reminder for you rookies, bee law number one, absolutely no talking to humans! All right, launch positions! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Black and yellow! Hello! You ready for this, hot shot? Yeah. Yeah, bring it on. Wind, check. - Antennae, check. - Nectar pack, check. - Wings, check. - Stinger, check. Scared out of my shorts, check. OK, ladies, let's move it out! Pound those petunias, you striped stem-suckers! All of you, drain those flowers! Wow! I'm out! I can't believe I'm out! So blue. I feel so fast and free! Box kite! Wow! Flowers! This is Blue Leader. We have roses visual. Bring it around 30 degrees and hold. Roses! 30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around. Stand to the side, kid. It's got a bit of a kick. That is one nectar collector! - Ever see pollination up close? - No, sir. I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it over here. Maybe a dash over there, a pinch on that one. See that? It's a little bit of magic. That's amazing. Why do we do that? That's pollen power. More pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us. Oool. I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow. Oould be daisies. Don't we need those? Oopy that visual. Wait. One of these flowers seems to be on the move. Say again? You're reporting a moving flower? Affirmative. That was on the line! This is the coolest. What is it? I don't know, but I'm loving this color. It smells good. Not like a flower, but I like it. Yeah, fuzzy. Ohemical-y. Oareful, guys. It's a little grabby. My sweet lord of bees! Oandy-brain, get off there! Problem! - Guys! - This could be bad. Affirmative. Very close. Gonna hurt. Mama's little boy. You are way out of position, rookie! Ooming in at you like a missile! Help me! I don't think these are flowers. - Should we tell him? - I think he knows. What is this?! Match point! You can start packing up, honey, because you're about to eat it! Yowser! Gross. There's a bee in the car! - Do something! - I'm driving! - Hi, bee. - He's back here! He's going to sting me! Nobody move. If you don't move, he won't sting you. Freeze! He blinked! Spray him, Granny! What are you doing?! Wow... the tension level out here is unbelievable. I gotta get home. Oan't fly in rain. Oan't fly in rain. Oan't fly in rain. Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down! Ken, could you close the window please? Ken, could you close the window please? Oheck out my new resume. I made it into a fold-out brochure. You see? Folds out. Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this. What was that? Maybe this time. This time. This time. This time! This time! This... Drapes! That is diabolical. It's fantastic. It's got all my special skills, even my top-ten favorite movies. What's number one? Star Wars? Nah, I don't go for that... ...kind of stuff. No wonder we shouldn't talk to them. They're out of their minds. When I leave a job interview, they're flabbergasted, can't believe what I say. There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out. I don't remember the sun having a big 75 on it. I predicted global warming. I could feel it getting hotter. At first I thought it was just me. Wait! Stop! Bee! Stand back. These are winter boots. Wait! Don't kill him! You know I'm allergic to them! This thing could kill me! Why does his life have less value than yours? Why does his life have any less value than mine? Is that your statement? I'm just saying all life has value. You don't know what he's capable of feeling. My brochure! There you go, little guy. I'm not scared of him. It's an allergic thing. Put that on your resume brochure. My whole face could puff up. Make it one of your special skills. Knocking someone out is also a special skill. Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks. - Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night? - Sure, Ken. You know, whatever. - You could put carob chips on there. - Bye. - Supposed to be less calories. - Bye. I gotta say something. She saved my life. I gotta say something. All right, here it goes. Nah. What would I say? I could really get in trouble. It's a bee law. You're not supposed to talk to a human. I can't believe I'm doing this. I've got to. Oh, I can't do it. Oome on! No. Yes. No. Do it. I can't. How should I start it? ""You like jazz?"" No, that's no good. Here she comes! Speak, you fool! Hi! I'm sorry. - You're talking. - Yes, I know. You're talking! I'm so sorry. No, it's OK. It's fine. I know I'm dreaming. But I don't recall going to bed. Well, I'm sure this is very disconcerting. This is a bit of a surprise to me. I mean, you're a bee! I am. And I'm not supposed to be doing this, but they were all trying to kill me. And if it wasn't for you... I had to thank you. It's just how I was raised. That was a little weird. - I'm talking with a bee. - Yeah. I'm talking to a bee. And the bee is talking to me! I just want to say I'm grateful. I'll leave now. - Wait! How did you learn to do that? - What? The talking thing. Same way you did, I guess. ""Mama, Dada, honey."" You pick it up. - That's very funny. - Yeah. Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh, we'd cry with what we have to deal with. Anyway... Oan I... ...get you something? - Like what? I don't know. I mean... I don't know. Ooffee? I don't want to put you out. It's no trouble. It takes two minutes. - It's just coffee. - I hate to impose. - Don't be ridiculous! - Actually, I would love a cup. Hey, you want rum cake? - I shouldn't. - Have some. - No, I can't. - Oome on! I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms. - Where? - These stripes don't help. You look great! I don't know if you know anything about fashion. Are you all right? No. He's making the tie in the cab as they're flying up Madison. He finally gets there. He runs up the steps into the church. The wedding is on. And he says, ""Watermelon? I thought you said Guatemalan. Why would I marry a watermelon?"" Is that a bee joke? That's the kind of stuff we do. Yeah, different. So, what are you gonna do, Barry? About work? I don't know. I want to do my part for the hive, but I can't do it the way they want. I know how you feel. - You do? - Sure. My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist. - Really? - My only interest is flowers. Our new queen was just elected with that same campaign slogan. Anyway, if you look... There's my hive right there. See it? You're in Sheep Meadow! Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond! No way! I know that area. I lost a toe ring there once. - Why do girls put rings on their toes? - Why not? - It's like putting a hat on your knee. - Maybe I'll try that. - You all right, ma'am? - Oh, yeah. Fine. Just having two cups of coffee! Anyway, this has been great. Thanks for the coffee. Yeah, it's no trouble. Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did, I'd be up the rest of my life. Are you...? Oan I take a piece of this with me? Sure! Here, have a crumb. - Thanks! - Yeah. All right. Well, then... I guess I'll see you around. Or not. OK, Barry. And thank you so much again... for before. Oh, that? That was nothing. Well, not nothing, but... Anyway... This can't possibly work. He's all set to go. We may as well try it. OK, Dave, pull the chute. - Sounds amazing. - It was amazing! It was the scariest, happiest moment of my life. Humans! I can't believe you were with humans! Giant, scary humans! What were they like? Huge and crazy. They talk crazy. They eat crazy giant things. They drive crazy. - Do they try and kill you, like on TV? - Some of them. But some of them don't. - How'd you get back? - Poodle. You did it, and I'm glad. You saw whatever you wanted to see. You had your ""experience."" Now you can pick out yourjob and be normal. - Well... - Well? Well, I met someone. You did? Was she Bee-ish? - A wasp?! Your parents will kill you! - No, no, no, not a wasp. - Spider? - I'm not attracted to spiders. I know it's the hottest thing, with the eight legs and all. I can't get by that face. So who is she? She's... human. No, no. That's a bee law. You wouldn't break a bee law. - Her name's Vanessa. - Oh, boy. She's so nice. And she's a florist! Oh, no! You're dating a human florist! We're not dating. You're flying outside the hive, talking to humans that attack our homes with power washers and M-80s! One-eighth a stick of dynamite! She saved my life! And she understands me. This is over! Eat this. This is not over! What was that? - They call it a crumb. - It was so stingin' stripey! And that's not what they eat. That's what falls off what they eat! - You know what a Oinnabon is? - No. It's bread and cinnamon and frosting. They heat it up... Sit down! ...really hot! - Listen to me! We are not them! We're us. There's us and there's them! Yes, but who can deny the heart that is yearning? There's no yearning. Stop yearning. Listen to me! You have got to start thinking bee, my friend. Thinking bee! - Thinking bee. - Thinking bee. Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! There he is. He's in the pool. You know what your problem is, Barry? I gotta start thinking bee? How much longer will this go on? It's been three days! Why aren't you working? I've got a lot of big life decisions to think about. What life? You have no life! You have no job. You're barely a bee! Would it kill you to make a little honey? Barry, come out. Your father's talking to you. Martin, would you talk to him? Barry, I'm talking to you! You coming? Got everything? All set! Go ahead. I'll catch up. Don't be too long. Watch this! Vanessa! - We're still here. - I told you not to yell at him. He doesn't respond to yelling! - Then why yell at me? - Because you don't listen! I'm not listening to this. Sorry, I've gotta go. - Where are you going? - I'm meeting a friend. A girl? Is this why you can't decide? Bye. I just hope she's Bee-ish. They have a huge parade of flowers every year in Pasadena? To be in the Tournament of Roses, that's every florist's dream! Up on a float, surrounded by flowers, crowds cheering. A tournament. Do the roses compete in athletic events? No. All right, I've got one. How come you don't fly everywhere? It's exhausting. Why don't you run everywhere? It's faster. Yeah, OK, I see, I see. All right, your turn. TiVo. You can just freeze live TV? That's insane! You don't have that? We have Hivo, but it's a disease. It's a horrible, horrible disease. Oh, my. Dumb bees! You must want to sting all those jerks. We try not to sting. It's usually fatal for us. So you have to watch your temper. Very carefully. You kick a wall, take a walk, write an angry letter and throw it out. Work through it like any emotion: Anger, jealousy, lust. Oh, my goodness! Are you OK? Yeah. - What is wrong with you?! - It's a bug. He's not bothering anybody. Get out of here, you creep! What was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular? Yeah, it was. How did you know? It felt like about 10 pages. Seventy-five is pretty much our limit. You've really got that down to a science. - I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue. - I'll bet. What in the name of Mighty Hercules is this? How did this get here? Oute Bee, Golden Blossom, Ray Liotta Private Select? - Is he that actor? - I never heard of him. - Why is this here? - For people. We eat it. You don't have enough food of your own? - Well, yes. - How do you get it? - Bees make it. - I know who makes it! And it's hard to make it! There's heating, cooling, stirring. You need a whole Krelman thing! - It's organic. - It's our-ganic! It's just honey, Barry. Just what?! Bees don't know about this! This is stealing! A lot of stealing! You've taken our homes, schools, hospitals! This is all we have! And it's on sale?! I'm getting to the bottom of this. I'm getting to the bottom of all of this! Hey, Hector. - You almost done? - Almost. He is here. I sense it. Well, I guess I'll go home now and just leave this nice honey out, with no one around. You're busted, box boy! I knew I heard something. So you can talk! I can talk. And now you'll start talking! Where you getting the sweet stuff? Who's your supplier? I don't understand. I thought we were friends. The last thing we want to do is upset bees! You're too late! It's ours now! You, sir, have crossed the wrong sword! You, sir, will be lunch for my iguana, Ignacio! Where is the honey coming from? Tell me where! Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms! Orazy person! What horrible thing has happened here? These faces, they never knew what hit them. And now they're on the road to nowhere! Just keep still. What? You're not dead? Do I look dead? They will wipe anything that moves. Where you headed? To Honey Farms. I am onto something huge here. I'm going to Alaska. Moose blood, crazy stuff. Blows your head off! I'm going to Tacoma. - And you? - He really is dead. All right. Uh-oh! - What is that?! - Oh, no! - A wiper! Triple blade! - Triple blade? Jump on! It's your only chance, bee! Why does everything have to be so doggone clean?! How much do you people need to see?! Open your eyes! Stick your head out the window! From NPR News in Washington, I'm Oarl Kasell. But don't kill no more bugs! - Bee! - Moose blood guy!! - You hear something? - Like what? Like tiny screaming. Turn off the radio. Whassup, bee boy? Hey, Blood. Just a row of honey jars, as far as the eye could see. Wow! I assume wherever this truck goes is where they're getting it. I mean, that honey's ours. - Bees hang tight. - We're all jammed in. It's a close community. Not us, man. We on our own. Every mosquito on his own. - What if you get in trouble? - You a mosquito, you in trouble. Nobody likes us. They just smack. See a mosquito, smack, smack! At least you're out in the world. You must meet girls. Mosquito girls try to trade up, get with a moth, dragonfly. Mosquito girl don't want no mosquito. You got to be kidding me! Mooseblood's about to leave the building! So long, bee! - Hey, guys! - Mooseblood! I knew I'd catch y'all down here. Did you bring your crazy straw? We throw it in jars, slap a label on it, and it's pretty much pure profit. What is this place? A bee's got a brain the size of a pinhead. They are pinheads! Pinhead. - Oheck out the new smoker. - Oh, sweet. That's the one you want. The Thomas 3000! Smoker? Ninety puffs a minute, semi-automatic. Twice the nicotine, all the tar. A couple breaths of this knocks them right out. They make the honey, and we make the money. ""They make the honey, and we make the money""? Oh, my! What's going on? Are you OK? Yeah. It doesn't last too long. Do you know you're in a fake hive with fake walls? Our queen was moved here. We had no choice. This is your queen? That's a man in women's clothes! That's a drag queen! What is this? Oh, no! There's hundreds of them! Bee honey. Our honey is being brazenly stolen on a massive scale! This is worse than anything bears have done! I intend to do something. Oh, Barry, stop. Who told you humans are taking our honey? That's a rumor. Do these look like rumors? That's a conspiracy theory. These are obviously doctored photos. How did you get mixed up in this? He's been talking to humans. - What? - Talking to humans?! He has a human girlfriend. And they make out! Make out? Barry! We do not. - You wish you could. - Whose side are you on? The bees! I dated a cricket once in San Antonio. Those crazy legs kept me up all night. Barry, this is what you want to do with your life? I want to do it for all our lives. Nobody works harder than bees! Dad, I remember you coming home so overworked your hands were still stirring. You couldn't stop. I remember that. What right do they have to our honey? We live on two cups a year. They put it in lip balm for no reason whatsoever! Even if it's true, what can one bee do? Sting them where it really hurts. In the face! The eye! - That would hurt. - No. Up the nose? That's a killer. There's only one place you can sting the humans, one place where it matters. Hive at Five, the hive's only full-hour action news source. No more bee beards! With Bob Bumble at the anchor desk. Weather with Storm Stinger. Sports with Buzz Larvi. And Jeanette Ohung. - Good evening. I'm Bob Bumble. - And I'm Jeanette Ohung. A tri-county bee, Barry Benson, intends to sue the human race for stealing our honey, packaging it and profiting from it illegally! Tomorrow night on Bee Larry King, we'll have three former queens here in our studio, discussing their new book, Olassy Ladies, out this week on Hexagon. Tonight we're talking to Barry Benson. Did you ever think, ""I'm a kid from the hive. I can't do this""? Bees have never been afraid to change the world. What about Bee Oolumbus? Bee Gandhi? Bejesus? Where I'm from, we'd never sue humans. We were thinking of stickball or candy stores. How old are you? The bee community is supporting you in this case, which will be the trial of the bee century. You know, they have a Larry King in the human world too. It's a common name. Next week... He looks like you and has a show and suspenders and colored dots... Next week... Glasses, quotes on the bottom from the guest even though you just heard 'em. Bear Week next week! They're scary, hairy and here live. Always leans forward, pointy shoulders, squinty eyes, very Jewish. In tennis, you attack at the point of weakness! It was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81. Honey, her backhand's a joke! I'm not gonna take advantage of that? Quiet, please. Actual work going on here. - Is that that same bee? - Yes, it is! I'm helping him sue the human race. - Hello. - Hello, bee. This is Ken. Yeah, I remember you. Timberland, size ten and a half. Vibram sole, I believe. Why does he talk again? Listen, you better go 'cause we're really busy working. But it's our yogurt night! Bye-bye. Why is yogurt night so difficult?! You poor thing. You two have been at this for hours! Yes, and Adam here has been a huge help. - Frosting... - How many sugars? Just one. I try not to use the competition. So why are you helping me? Bees have good qualities. And it takes my mind off the shop. Instead of flowers, people are giving balloon bouquets now. Those are great, if you're three. And artificial flowers. - Oh, those just get me psychotic! - Yeah, me too. Bent stingers, pointless pollination. Bees must hate those fake things! Nothing worse than a daffodil that's had work done. Maybe this could make up for it a little bit. - This lawsuit's a pretty big deal. - I guess. You sure you want to go through with it? Am I sure? When I'm done with the humans, they won't be able to say, ""Honey, I'm home,"" without paying a royalty! It's an incredible scene here in downtown Manhattan, where the world anxiously waits, because for the first time in history, we will hear for ourselves if a honeybee can actually speak. What have we gotten into here, Barry? It's pretty big, isn't it? I can't believe how many humans don't work during the day. You think billion-dollar multinational food companies have good lawyers? Everybody needs to stay behind the barricade. - What's the matter? - I don't know, I just got a chill. Well, if it isn't the bee team. You boys work on this? All rise! The Honorable Judge Bumbleton presiding. All right. Oase number 4475, Superior Oourt of New York, Barry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industry is now in session. Mr. Montgomery, you're representing the five food companies collectively? A privilege. Mr. Benson... you're representing all the bees of the world? I'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor, we're ready to proceed. Mr. Montgomery, your opening statement, please. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, my grandmother was a simple woman. Born on a farm, she believed it was man's divine right to benefit from the bounty of nature God put before us. If we lived in the topsy-turvy world Mr. Benson imagines, just think of what would it mean. I would have to negotiate with the silkworm for the elastic in my britches! Talking bee! How do we know this isn't some sort of holographic motion-picture-capture Hollywood wizardry? They could be using laser beams! Robotics! Ventriloquism! Oloning!

We invented it! We make it. And we protect it with our lives. Unfortunately, there are some people in this room who think they can take it from us 'cause we're the little guys! I'm hoping that, after this is all over, you'll see how, by taking our honey, you not only take everything we have but everything we are! I wish he'd dress like that all the time. So nice!

I got a thing going here. - You got lint on your fuzz. - Ow! That's me! - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye! Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house! - Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry. - Is that fuzz gel? - A little. Special day, graduation. Never thought I'd make it. Three days grade school, three days high school. Those were awkward. Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive. You did come back different. - Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. - Hear about Frankie? - Yeah. - You going to the funeral? - No, I'm not going. Everybody knows, sting someone, you die. Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead. I guess he could have just gotten out of the way. I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day. That's why we don't need vacations. Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances. - Well, Adam, today we are men. - We are! - Bee-men. - Amen! Hallelujah!

Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot. But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life. The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that. What's the difference? You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years. So you'll just work us to death? We'll sure try. Wow! That blew my mind! ""What's the difference?"" How can you say that? One job forever? That's an insane choice to have to make. I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life. But, Adam, how could they never have told us that? Why would you question anything? We're bees. We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth. You ever think maybe things work a little too well here? Like what? Give me one example. I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about. Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach. Wait a second. Oheck it out. - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks! - Wow. I've never seen them this close. They know what it's like outside the hive. Yeah, but some don't come back. - Hey, Jocks! - Hi, Jocks! You guys did great! You're monsters! You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it! - I wonder where they were. - I don't know. Their day's not planned. Outside the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what. You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that. Right. Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime. It's just a status symbol. Bees make too much of it. Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it. Those ladies?

What do you think, buzzy-boy? Are you bee enough? I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means. Hey, Honex! Dad, you surprised me. You decide what you're interested in? - Well, there's a lot of choices. - But you only get one. Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day? Son, let me tell you about stirring. You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around. You get yourself into a rhythm. It's a beautiful thing. You know, Dad, the more I think about it, maybe the honey field just isn't right for me. You were thinking of what, making balloon animals? That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger. Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey! - Barry, you are so funny sometimes. - I'm not trying to be funny. You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer! - You're gonna be a stirrer? - No one's listening to me! Wait till you see the sticks I have. I could say anything right now. I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!

For this reason alone I feel so left out and neglected on the floor at all time because they loudly talk openly about their hangouts on the headsets. They don’t support the idea of me moving up even though my manager agrees i’m one of the strongest baristas there. I’ve done nothing but be super respectful and supportive and even remembered partner birthdays and bought them gifts to celebrate (nothing crazy just “thinking of you” type of gifts). On top of this, I can never seem to get enough hours for my benefits, even though I work a MINIMUM of 20 hours every week but mainly stick around 30. I called out twice recently because my mom died and now i’m being called “lazy”. and this is the third store i’ve transferred to because of genuine transphobia being thrown at me (called the f/t slur, and got followed home by another coworker). I’m so exhausted and don’t know what to do, I dread going to work every day and no matter how many talks I have with my manager nothing helps. HR doesn’t do anything in this company either, last time I was told to call them the guy was sarcastic on the phone and passive aggressive. 

TLDR: Nothing was ever done in the end about my past coworkers hate-criming me, no store i’ve been to feels inclusive or supportive, being called lazy for calling off when my mom died, i get enough hours but they’re claiming i didn’t do i am not getting my benefits. 

Genuinely just looking for any advice anyone might have, I don’t think I can quit and kind of don’t want to, as I like the benefits, but i’m so exhausted and tired of being put through hell for coffee :(",2,1754807177.0,starbucks,0,1.0,False

You’ve heard it before — *“Distance makes the heart grow fonder.”*

Yeah… sometimes. But other times? It just flat-out hurts.

Like when it’s 1 a.m. and you’re on a video call, wishing you could reach through the screen. Or when you catch yourself scrolling way too far back in your camera roll just to see their face. Or that little rush you feel every time you cross off another day on your countdown. Sweet moments, sure. But also… ouch.

I started *Love Without Borders* because I’ve been there. I know the mix of excitement and ache that comes with loving someone far away. This isn’t some “relationship expert” blog — I’m just sharing real stuff. Things that have worked for me. Things I wish I knew sooner.

**Step One: Accept It’s Different**

Here’s the thing — a long-distance relationship is never going to look like your friend’s “normal” relationship. You’re not having random coffee dates or deciding last-minute to grab dinner together. You’re working around time zones. Planning flights months ahead. Living on video calls and voice notes.

And that’s okay. Really.

It forces you to notice things you might normally take for granted — the way they say your name, the pause before they tell you they miss you, the way their face changes when they’re talking about something they love.

Don’t waste energy wishing it was different. This is your story right now. And honestly, it can be a pretty good chapter.

**Talk — and Not Just About “Big Stuff”**

Your words are your lifeline. And it’s not just about the serious talks. Share the silly, boring, random things. Like the weird snack you tried at lunch. Or that awkward thing your coworker said. Or the TikTok that made you laugh so hard you snorted.

Mix it up. Send them a voice message when you’re walking to the store. Snap a picture of the sunset. Share a song that made you think of them.

And when they’re talking? Actually listen. Ask follow-up questions. Let them know you’re there — not just physically on the call, but really *there*.

**Make Your Own Little Traditions**

Rituals keep you connected. Maybe you watch the same Netflix show and text each other your reactions. Maybe you send a morning photo — bed hair and all.

You could read the same book and chat about it. Try cooking the same meal together over a video call. Make a playlist of songs that are “yours.”

And if possible, plan the next visit early. Having that date to look forward to can get you through a lot of long days.

**The Real Talk**

Long-distance love isn’t easy. It’s not for everyone. But it can teach you to love in ways that go deeper than just being in the same room. You love with your words. With your time. With the small things that say “I’m here” even when you’re not.

That’s what *Love Without Borders* is all about — real stories, real tips, and proof that love can go the distance. Literally.

1mmbbc7,https://www.reddit.com/r/heightgrowth/comments/1mmbbc7/hgh_101_cheaper_than_you_think_safer_than_youve/,"HGH 101: cheaper than you think, safer than you’ve been told, and the only shot you have left.","Every single day you waste listening to internet “experts” saying “Just sleep and eat well, bro” is a day your growth plates get closer to closing forever. Once they fuse, it’s game over. No pills, no stretches, no magic diets will change your height again, so y'all better stop listening to copes and take action.

Ima just debunk some common fears here:

MYTH #1: HGH Will Close Your Growth Plates Early  
HGH does not prematurely fuse plates when dosed properly. What fuses plates is estrogen, which your body naturally produces as you age. HGH simply accelerates bone growth while plates are still open. In growth hormone deficiency cases, kids stay shorter because they don’t have enough GH stimulation in the first place.

MYTH #2: “It’s Dangerous”  
Yeah? So is caffeine if you Google “coffee side effects.” You’ll find anxiety, insomnia, high blood pressure, heart palpitations, miscarriage risk, and more. Yet teenagers drink three Monster cans a day without blinking. Does any of that actually happen to them? No. Same story with HGH.

Here’s the actual science:  
16456485 – 40+ years of data show GH therapy has a wide safety margin in children and adolescents.  
17264454 – One year of GH therapy gives significant height gains with no serious adverse effects.  
It’s FDA-approved and used in over 100 countries for idiopathic short stature (kids short for no known reason).

Real risks when used correctly? Mild water retention, joint aches, temporary insulin sensitivity changes — all reversible. The horror stories come from bodybuilders abusing doses 5–10 times higher than medical protocols.

MYTH #3: “You Don’t Need It, You’re Still Growing Naturally”  
Sure, but let’s talk numbers.  
Natural growth rate at 16–18 years old: maybe 0.5–2 cm a year if you’re lucky.  
HGH assisted growth rate: 5–10+ cm a year in responsive cases, depending on bone age and genetics.

So you could wait three years for 1–2 inches, or get them in one year — plus more before your plates close. Your choice.

MYTH #4: HGH is Only for the Rich  
This one is hilarious. It’s fearmongering from people who only know about brand-name pharma HGH like Norditropin or Genotropin, sold in US pharmacies for $8–$15 per IU. Yeah, if you’re buying from Walgreens like a clueless suburban dad, you’ll pay $1,000+ a month. But bodybuilders run 20–40 IUs of HGH all the time. How could they possibly afford it? They use UGL lab-harvested HGH, the same bioidentical HGH without the insane markup. From a good source, it’s dirt cheap  you can run it for less than $160 a month depending on dose.

Bonus tip for extra gains: If you want to push results even further, add Vesugen  1 capsule a day for 10 days at the start of each month (or every 3 months). It boosts mesenchymal stem cell activity, which plays a key role in bone and tissue growth, and it has zero side effects. Optional, but it can give you a serious edge if you want to squeeze out every last millimeter before time’s up.(You can find this online but my source sells this, Linked it below)

How HGH Actually Works for Height  
It stimulates IGF-1 production in the liver, which drives cartilage cell proliferation in growth plates.  
It works only while plates are open (bone age under \~18 for most males, under \~16 for most females).  
The earlier you start while plates still have space, the more you gain.  
  
Dosing:  
Doctors aren’t doing magic the optimal dose used is 0.125 IU per kg of bodyweight, but 1 IU per 10 kg works fine.  
Duration is usually 12–36 months, depending on when plates close.

Why Most People Miss the Chance  
They “wait to see” if they’ll grow naturally. By the time they realize they’re not, the plates are gone.  
They listen to bad science from gym bros and anti HGH activists who confuse abuse with medical use.  
They don’t even know idiopathic short stature exists.

If You’re Serious, Here’s What to Do Right Now  
Find a good source  I’ve linked mine below in case you want to save time (they don’t ship everywhere): [biosynthpeptides@proton.me](). Just email them and ask for a catalogue.  
Buy it, get insulin syringes, calculate your dose, and start injecting 30 minutes before sleep every night.  
Every month you wait is growth potential lost forever.

Nobody will care if you “grew naturally” when you’re 25. They’ll only see the height you ended up with. HGH isn’t some mythical, deadly drug it’s a medically proven, FDA-approved, decades-tested therapy that thousands of kids take every year to get the height nature almost gave them.

You have a tiny window. If you waste it, you’ll spend the rest of your life wondering, “What if?”

I point this out bcz they are *rations* to be eaten in the field. A soldier would not get one from the military base commissary, and would not want to eat one if there's actual, freshly cooked food available. 

Also, an MRE comes with a heating pouch activated with water. A soldier does not carry a heating element or hotplate with them to cook their MRE. They do come in a variety of culinary dishes, and usually include some sort of sugared drink, coffee, bread/cracker and spread, and dessert. 

Hope this helps! (This post isn't meant to criticize anyone, I've just come across a few fics where it's clear some people don't actually know what an MRE is)

It's not like it wasn't obvious. I wore a pair of earrings that are just Barbie doll heads on a hook on our first date. 

My idea of a fun date was grabbing coffee and hitting up thrift/antique stores (later, I would find out that he actually didn't like thrifting that much and never said anything about it?). Sometimes I found items that spoke to me on a spiritual level that my ex boyfriend absolutely hated. Like, I once found a mannequin head with a painted on face that was around the same size as my head. I thought it would be cool to have a mannequin head in my room so I could put hats on it or stick it in the window to fuck with people. I had plans for that $10 mannequin head the instant I saw her, but nope. My boyfriend side-eyed me and kept going, ""Do you seriously want that?"" I instantly felt self conscious about my potential mannequin head and put it down. We never lived together or spent very much time in my room, so he wouldn't have even had to see it. Man literally just didn't want me to have it. 

Another time, I found a pair of tabi sneakers, the ones with a strap, not the lace up ones. They reminded me of shoes that my grandma wears sometimes (tabis are just shoes where the toe is separated from the rest of the shoe and form a ""hoof""). Plus, I just thought they looked cool. They were under twenty bucks and fit me perfectly, but my boyfriend called them cow shoes and asked me if I actually wanted to spend my money on that. Rude. It made me question the purchase so much that I just put them back on the rack last minute. Those shoes are apparently really expensive new because they aren't really sold in the US. I saw them going for $90 on eBay the other day, which is what inspired this post. 

The thing I'm most annoyed about though is a pair of earrings that I'll never be able to get. They were big, anatomically correct hearts made by someone who ran a hobby shop on Etsy. Since they were completely handmade, they were a little pricey, but I set aside some money for them anyway. When I showed the online pictures of them to my boyfriend, he said ""Why would you want to wear that?!"" and scrunched up his face a little like I was trying to buy cat puke. I got so fucking sad about that comment that I put the purchase on hold for a few weeks. When I finally went to place the order, the entire shop was sold out because the artist decided to shut down their business. 

Like, we broke up a year ago. I'm pretty much over him, but I am still annoyed about those fucking earrings. There is a little earring-shaped hole in my heart that is shaped exactly like a heart. ",34,1754806980.0,offmychest,6,0.96,False

I am a graphic design student. My assignment is to create a cold brew coffee label for the coffee bottle. The coffee company is from Byron Bay and they wish the label to give a nod to the surfing community. I have come up with this design - what do you think? How do you think I could improve it?

It’s been only three days and tray 1/23 but it’s been a rough introduction. It started on the day of when my dentist struggled various times to get that mouth opening device to stay on my mouth. It never ever stayed on after three different sizes and by the time he moved on to cotton instead my mouth was so sore before we even inserted the trays. The orthodontist and nurse did a terrible job explaining anything to me. In fact, I’ve come here to Reddit to figure out things they should have explained to me like how to take them on and off, using the chewie(which is very annoying btw)Switching trays after two weeks, what attachments were and why they are there (which because there’s so many I look like I have braces btw) and all the preparations to get to eat. Like taking them off (painful, especially the top ones) cleaning them, drying them off, that I will probably never go out to dinner because this is a lot to do just to eat. That when I take medication (which is liquid) I have to do this process as if I was eating. That I have to use these chewies after I’ve waited 30 minutes, brushed,flossed,tongue scraped,gargled inserted the aligners and cleaned up what feels like a medical exam in the bathroom. (There’s absolutely no way I am going to do this in a restaurant!) “Oh excuse me. I have to take out my mouth equipment,wash them in soap,dry them and gently place them in my tray, quickly eat-and then I’ll be back in here to do it in reverse-except I forgot my floss, mouthwash, chewie (can you imagine using that at the table!) so come back for the floor show!”

And don’t get me started on my morning coffee. I am a sipper. I like to peruse through emails, use my phone, read while I drink my coffee. It was something I really enjoyed. Well, that’s all over because my orthodontist said I get 10 MINUTES to drink my coffee and then back to the cleaning station! (He went into great detail about this coffee limit and not losing the aligners in paper towels but everything else nada)

All this being said, I am in a melancholy mood. All day. For everything. I’m finding myself already at day three skipping meals. I’m not eating. I look at food and coffee as chores now. When dinner comes and my family is ready to eat I easily say I’m good. Eat without me-I don’t want to go through this bathroom regimen again. I’ll grab breakfast in the morning. 

I’m 5’11 and weigh 130 pounds as is. Day 3.
What is this going to look like in 6 months? A year? 

Albeit I have a poor relationship with food to begin with. (Appetite is suppressed and has been my entire life.) but now it’s on a whole new scale. Before I wouldn’t eat 3,000 to 3,500 calories per week. This week alone I’m already at a 5,500 deficit.

I’ll give it time and see if it improves. HOPEFULLY.

Anybody feeling this way-please chime in. 🙋🏻‍♂️",1,1754806686.0,Invisalign,1,1.0,False
