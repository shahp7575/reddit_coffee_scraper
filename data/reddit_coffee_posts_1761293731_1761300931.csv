Hi does anyone ride a sports bike? I'm seeking more pillion experiences. I've also been on a few sport tourers such as the H2. I'm an experienced pillion. Around Kent from the Faversham area down and around the Kent coastline. Countryside ride outs are great too. Have all my own gear including comms.

I recently moved into a new apartment. Before this, I lived with my mother, so I don’t really have any furniture yet. There are a few items I’ve got my eye on, but I’m a bit worried about styling them properly in my living room.

I’m currently considering the IKEA Jättebo couch:

I’d really appreciate some advice on how to arrange the room with a sofa, TV, coffee table, and possibly a dining table.

1oettbp,https://www.reddit.com/r/dumbphones/comments/1oettbp/the_struggle_to_replace_my_old_nokia_216_farmer/,The struggle to replace my old Nokia 216 … Farmer feedback,"Hi to all the community, and first thank to all for all the exchange you put here. It helped me a lot to navigate the deep world of dumbphoning.

For situation, i am european farmer/rancher, long time user of basic/dumb phones. I use my phone as a tool, and try to stay away from all the modern and numerous apps we can use today in my job. I don’t like to carry an expensive device outside, and prefer to do my online activity in my office with a good coffee.

And so, my brave Nokia 216 give away after 5 or 6 years of use. I was very satisfied with that device, and very confident it would be easy to find a slightly better dumbphone after all those years of technologies progress.

Well, what a disappointment !

I learned here, that kaiOS was like a dead system at the moment, with no hope a real evolution.  
I understood also that the Cat S22 was no longer produce, and the phone branch of the company dump away.  
And like that, i convince me to flip to a flip phone (note the joke here ...), excepting a more robust phone. So, time to buy a Nokia 2660.

I was wrong ...

This phone is a toy, fell/sound empty inside and not robust at all. S30+ still the same OS with no real evolution in 5 years. And after 2h of use, the phone was not able to boot anymore.  
So, 2660 back to the seller, and welcome to the savior, a Nokia 235.

To give a short feedback, I have mixed feeling about that device :

I love the form factor, it’s a perfect size to my taste.  
Keyboard is good, sound is good.  
Wireless fm radio is a good improvement.

But …

The S30+ … I don’t understand how they can, but he is worst that the one on my old Nokia 216.  
SMS visualization and discussion is bad. Calendar “app” do not share info with the the alarm “app”. The “Note” is missing now. Torch is very weak.

I will not send back this one. But if one day I need a new one, I will consider a device like the small Doov on android somebody propose here.

To finish and be perfectly clear on how I organize my life with that device, we have at home an android tablet (refurbish Nokia T20) for when we relax and whatapp with the family. And as an other new tool, my wife (and lovely associate in business !) recently consent to evolve to a smartphone able to accept ncf payment when we direct sale to customers (a refurbish Nokia G42). We deplore it, but payment with cash start to be a hard thing to impose when you run a small business.

Hope it will be useful to somebody ! ;)

Can't just grab coffee or show up at their place anymore. Video calls are fine but something feels missing.

Started sending random small gifts in the mail for no particular reason just to maintain that physical connection. Not expensive stuff, just things that made me think of them or that I knew they'd appreciate. Keeps our friendship feeling more tangible than just digital communication.

They mentioned struggling with their plants dying constantly. Found this self watering planter system on uncommongoods and sent it randomly on a Tuesday. They sent me a photo of their thriving plants a month later and said every time they water it they think about me. That meant way more than our weekly video calls somehow.

The physical object existing in their daily life creates this connection that video calls don't quite replicate. Like I'm present in their space even though I'm thousands of miles away. Sounds cheesy when I write it out but it genuinely helps with the distance.

Now we both do it. Random small thoughtful packages showing up every few months. Keeps the friendship feeling active and present instead of just maintenance mode.

But slowly, things changed. Calls were shorter, messages delayed. And then, after my sister passed, I found out his family had chosen someone else for him — and he agreed. Within weeks, he was married to her.

Synopsis: so there's this therapist who has immaculate knowledge about not just mental health but technology, he doesn’t look or act like a therapist. More like a tired dad who cracks bad jokes, wears wrinkled shirts, and somehow always smells faintly of coffee. But behind the clumsy humor and awkward charm lies a man who understands people better than anyone — even if he never admits it.

When one of his patients, a quiet young man drowning in depression, takes his own life, the loss crushes him. Wracked with guilt, he dives into a strange obsession: finding a way to undo what happened. Everyone sees him as a fool, but beneath that easygoing grin hides a mind sharper than anyone realizes.

Through sheer obsession and accidental brilliance, he discovers a way to travel through time — and he uses it to save the young man before it’s too late. The joy of saving one life pushes him further. Soon, he’s secretly traveling through time to prevent suicides, one by one.

But as he keeps changing fate, reality begins to warp — memories shift, timelines bend, and strange coincidences start piling up.

Anyone else ever felt that gut-wrenching moment when your navigation app tells you to ride on a highway? I remember the first time I pulled out my phone while on my scooter, only to find myself staring at a route that said, 'turn right onto the freeway.' I couldn’t believe it. High speeds and cars zipping past? Not exactly what I signed up for when I bought my scooter.

That experience sparked the idea for Urban Rider. I wanted a navigation app that truly understood the unique challenges we face as scooter riders. After getting frustrated with mainstream apps routing me onto dangerous streets, I decided to create something tailored just for us. 

Urban Rider avoids highways entirely, making sure we can stick to scooter-friendly paths and bike lanes. It’s designed to keep us off those fast lanes and help us navigate the city safely. It calculates ETAs based on our speeds, not cars, so you can plan your ride better. 

Just last week, I used it to navigate a complicated route across town. The app led me through quiet streets lined with coffee shops and parks instead of sending me on a hair-raising dash alongside angry drivers. It’s been a game changer for my daily rides.

If you want to give it a try, here’s the link to Urban Rider: [Urban Rider on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/scooter-navigation-urban-rider/id6746205274?l=en-GB).

1oetl0w,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1oetl0w/aitah_for_wanting_to_leave_my_partner_5_months_pp/,AITAH for wanting to leave my partner 5 months PP,"I (30F) resent my partner (30M) and daydream about leaving him. 

Before our babies, our relationship was perfect. He made me feel special. He would plan dates, day trips, spontaneous nights away, he’d drop me food to work and coffee as a surprise if I was having a bad shift, he’d brush my hair, massage me, he’d do anything for me. Our nights together were wonderful and our sex life was perfect, sometimes 3 times a day and he’d make me finish every single time even if he finished first. 

Moving on, he knew while we were dating I never wanted children, and he agreed neither did he. Roughly 8/9 months into our relationship he kept making remarks and jokes and ‘trapping me’ and ‘getting me pregnant’, I had to keep reminding I DO NOT WANT CHILDREN. I sat him down one night and had a serious conversation with him and reminded him how serious I am about not wanting children. He agrees and explained he was only kidding. Fast forward 2 months later, I find out I’m pregnant, and it’s twins. I was devastated, I didn’t know what to do or how to feel. I told him, and he was over the moon, crying how he can’t wait to become a father and how excited he is. I was in utter shock, abortion didn’t cross my mind as I just couldn’t. I kept breaking down in shock explaining how I can’t do it, how I’m so scared I’ll be a terrible mother and loose my individuality and independence, how I’ll never have the time to care for myself again. He PROMISED I will always have time as we’re a team and we’re in this together. I’m an extremely independent woman and have been since I was 17, I’ve always paid my way and bought everything I own or wanted. I’ve always dreamed of having my own little home and sanctuary, which he knew. My own space. 

I had to move out of my apartment with my friend, and move into his home which he owns, as I didn’t have enough for a deposit just yet and I don’t think its ideal purchasing while pregnant and going through that stress. The agreement was I pay for food shopping and buy anything the house needs, so I can save for maternity. Which I thought was great. Then when I’m back in work, 50/50. 1 month into being there and giving up my apartment, he started to change. He become a man child, I done all the cooking, cleaning, I would have to carry all the shopping in, unpack everything (I wouldn’t mind if I wasn’t pregnant) if a certain area wasn’t clean to his standard he’d make remarks. Whenever we would have conversations about the house he’d remind me it’s HIS house, even though when I was getting cold feet about moving in here he kept explaining it’s my home too and what’s his is mine. He started tracking everything I’m spending, even though I was still working at the time, if I got my nails done or buy new maternity clothes he’d make statements such as I’m wasting money and won’t be wearing them long and I don’t need to get my nails done. He started watching me through the ring cameras (I have the ring app I can see when he’s live watching), he would listen in on all my calls. My friends and family won’t come here as they don’t feel comfortable. 

Fast forward, I’m not 6 months PP and things have gotten worse. I’m a single mum in a relationship. He’s done maybe 7 nights in total of helping throughout the nights. I also purchased every single thing for these babies, he’s never even bought a packet of nappies. I’ll be up at 5/6am every morning, both twins up and ready for the day, I’ll do all the cleaning and tidying throughout the day while trying to juggle entertaining and feeding twins, while settling and soothing them whenever needed. He’ll come home from work, have 20/30 minutes with them, he’ll then go to the toilet and be there for ages. He’ll then come down and ask what’s for food, if I say I’m so exhausted I haven’t even thought about it he’ll scoff and roll his eyes. We’ve not done one family focused activity since the babies have been here, it’s been me on my own taking them or with a friend. Everytime I leave the house he’s texting asking where I’m going, and if I don’t respond he rings. He never asks me if I’m okay or offers help or support. I literally do everything in this house, even though I have BEGGED this man for support and some acknowledgment. All he ever comes back with is I don’t cook him meals for work so I want to see him fail. 

One night I was very unwell and could barely lift my head (I think this was from exhaustion), I could here one of the babies crying and I asked him to go check, he started slamming doors (it’s 3am in the morning), he came home from work that day being rude to me and saying how he has fo work. 

I don’t think he realises how good he has it, all he has to do is go to work, and I appreciate that can be hard too. But he has no idea how exhausting this is. I have postpartum depression but haven’t told him because he simply won’t care. We haven’t held hands since the babies have been here he never tells me he loves me. But when we argue he says things like ‘I love you you’re the mother of my children and I’ll never let you leave’.

1oetiuh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AIO/comments/1oetiuh/aio_for_blocking_my_sensei/,AIO for blocking my sensei,"I (F48) recently went back to karate after a long absence. At the same time my personal life has unravelled. Without going too much into it, even though it's entirely relevant, my aunt passed away from cancer in June. She was always more than an aunt though. We have been through so much living next door to each other and I am completely heartbroken. I've been living in a unit that's next door to hers on the same property for the last 12 years. She owned her unit, and I'm renting my unit from my uncle. Both units have been sold, and I have just over a week left before I must leave. 
So October has been a very difficult month, packing up her home, her entire life, and now mine. I also started a new job after a long absence from work.
Back to karate though, everything was going well there and I've made new friends. They're the kind of people that like to catch up outside of training too. So when a sensei (M54) approached me during class in the middle of September for a bit of one on one training and we continued talking after class I didn't think much of him suggesting we grab coffee at some point. 
So, we did. We got coffee. We got along really well, although now it feels like I got mirrored. And then a week later we planned to go out for dinner, but I was busy with my cousins discussing end of sale plans, and asked to reschedule it for the next day. He seemed fine with that at first, but now I think differently. The dinner went fine, but I really didn't feel like he was interested in who I am. Tbh, I think he was just looking for sex. I'm pretty much asexual, I do have sexual thoughts and sometimes feelings, I just don't act on them, and I tend to overlook advances as people just being friendly because I'm not wired that way. So it was further into this dinner that I went ""ohhhh""...""oh no.."".. 
At the end of the day he's my sensei and I don't want to shit where I eat. 

Anyway, a lot happened since that dinner, firstly I started working again, and that's when I realised I would have less free time, and definitely less energy. I have Crohns disease, my energy levels really can't be spread thin. So between working and packing up 2 units, I decided to be upfront with him and say October is too full now, I really didn't want to add any more to my plate, and that catching up on weekends wasn't really going to work out for me. Perhaps I should've told him I'm not into him like that, but it was also too soon for me to know for sure, and I really just needed friends, and we were becoming friends, or so I thought.
Here's where it turned into red flags. A day or two later he asked me to go to a concert with him mid-October, to a band he likes but I don't know. I had to explain again that I worked early starts and have already committed to a 2 week roster and it's a bit soon to be demanding a day off, and any time I have off was for either packing up or recovering.  He wrote that he knew I probably wouldn't ""WANT TO"" but still decided to ask. I immediately felt like he was pressuring me and ignoring the facts.
On a thursday he asked about my weekend plans and I explained to him (yes I sent an essay) that I was busy all weekend because it was the only time my cousins and I were all free. I finished my essay with ""have you got much on this weekend,"" and he responded ""not really"". That's it. That's all he wrote after I basically gave him complete access to what was going on with me physically, mentally and emotionally, and he just says 2 words. I interpreted it correctly of course. He had cracked the shits because I was unavailable. So it made me angry and I told my cousins. Now they no longer liked him. I had liked talking to him, but more was definitely not something I was ready to consider. But I had the problem of him being my sensei, and realised I needed to deal with this cautiously. 
As it turned out I was free on the Saturday, but I didn't tell him that until he messaged me at 7pm saturday night. I just wrote that things got postponed and I'd spent the day at home. My way of saying ""hey we could've hung out if you hadn't been a jerk 2 days ago, but why would I have let you know.."". 
The following weekend despite again being told midweek that my cousins and I were packing up my aunts home, he again got shitty with me. Even more shitty when on the Sunday I spent the day with my mum who was flying out to Japan on the Tuesday, and Sunday was the only free day we both had. But yeah, again he got short with me over that. I told mum about it, now she no longer liked him.
This is when I found out that another sensei was involved in this situation. She had told him I was single. Now it all made sense why I felt like he had expectations of me that I wasn't delivering. Why he had turned up at her class halfway through and zoned in on me. Why he got so annoyed when I wasn't available to meet his needs. I realised they both viewed me as a solution to his problem. The female sensei let slip to me that he had anger issues in the past, and I said ""he's impatient, and now it's pissing me off."" And she said she'd talk to him. 
The following weekend he tried multiple times to talk me into going to his home, despite again packing up my aunts home, that's when I knew he wasn't listening to the female sensei either, and I knew I didn't want to be alone with him. 
On Monday at 7pm he sent a text, basically says ""I hope you aren't feeling uncomfortable or pressured, I just want to talk to you and find out if we're on the same page"" and I deciphered that to mean ""what are we?"" So I responded with ""I don't have the time or energy for this"". 
On Tuesday I went to karate, not his class though, but halfway through I had an anxiety attack. The female sensei took me out back and I just completely unravelled. She told me he'd called her after the text and was whining about me not spending time with him or talking to him. And I said ""why would I? Ive explained whats going on, he doesn't listen. And my family all know about how hes been behaving and they dont like him."" She apologised for her part in it and got protective of me. I guess she didn't realise he'd act this bad. He turned up. She kept me close so he didn't come near me. The following day I met with her, and told her everything, and she said ""so, your aunt died who you've been really close with, your first real home is sold, you have to move, you haven't found anywhere yet, you're grieving, you're only just working again, your health has only just settled down but stress flares it up, and you're stressed in a lot of ways already and you told him all this."" And I said ""yep, and he cracked the shits because I didn't give up time doing all this or want to give up any free time I had for him."" 
She told me he's still angry at his ex wife, and I said then he shouldn't date because he'll get angry at her, but take it out on the new woman because she's the only one within reach. Like he's been doing with me. And I then gave her a very true example of the last guy I dated doing exactly that, which ended with him trying to strangle me after his ex sent him a text that pissed him off.
I've now blocked him on text, and on Facebook even though we never got to the fb friend stage. 
Now I'm considering leaving karate. I'll be losing a lot of good friends I have made. The alternative is constantly avoiding him or pretending everything's fine, which I don't want to do because I loathe being unauthentic. ",1,1761299516.0,AIO,0,1.0,False

I’d really appreciate some advice on how to arrange the room with a sofa, TV, coffee table, and possibly a dining table.

So, I've (28F) been friends with Sarah (29F) since college. We're super close or at least we were. Lately, she's been going through a rough patch with work stress and a breakup, and I've tried to be supportive. I've listened to her vent for hours, brought over food when she was down, and even helped her update her resume.

But here's the issue: We've had plans to hang out three times in the past month, and each time she's canceled last minute. First time was a movie night she said she was too tired from work, which I get. Second time, we were supposed to grab coffee, but she texted an hour before saying her ex called and she needed to deal with it. Okay, emergencies happen. But the third time was last weekend: We planned a hike we've been talking about for ages. I bought snacks, packed my bag, and was excited because I needed a break too (I've been dealing with my own job burnout). She canceled 30 minutes before we were supposed to meet, saying she ""just wasn't feeling up to it"" and wanted to stay in.

I was frustrated because I'd rearranged my schedule each time, and it felt like my time wasn't being respected. I didn't blow up, but I texted her: ""Hey, I understand you're going through stuff, but this is the third time you've canceled on short notice. It hurts because it feels like our plans aren't a priority. I think I need some space for a bit to recharge.""

She responded by calling me selfish and unsupportive, saying I should be more understanding of her mental health and that ""real friends don't bail when things get tough."" Now she's telling mutual friends that I'm abandoning her in her time of need, and a couple have messaged me saying I should apologize.

I feel bad because I know she's struggling, and maybe I could've phrased it better. But I also think it's fair to set boundaries. AITA?",3,1761299026.0,AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC,1,1.0,False

I went to the doctor at least a week later, after a neck biopsy of having at least eight different needles inserted into my neck mind you each at least the size of half a ruler. :( 
Two days later, my main doctor calls me and my mom is downstairs. We are returning from getting coffee, and he announces that I had thyroid cancer. due to the biopsy and the neck ultrasound, it came conclusive with my diagnosis being thyroid cancer, I had lymph nodes in the surrounding area at least more than 38 lymph nodes with cancer fluid and one toonie sized tumour of cancer inside my thyroid. The day, my doctor called. Two days later I was BEYOND reluctant that I was in the operation room signing papers to save my life as you see. It was starting to spread. 
I really had nobody because I had prior friendship drama that welted me down while I was dealing through this. I had that was called thyroidectomy, and I had my entire thyroid removed after my surgery. I just couldn’t speak and I was told not to because my voice was deeply affected and I was super emotional,  as I was a musician before my cancer. 
I went through radiation. Followed the diet of no salt, no sugar and lost so sooo  much weight. Two years later, I get the call again, the doctor told me I had lymphoma cancer and had lymph nodes growing and spreading at a rapid pace, again like the first I was beyond lucky that I was getting the surgery two days later in the hospital again. I had in total another 26 lymph nodes removed however, with a different doctor that specialized in lymphoma. I again went through the radiation and by far a year later I am cancer free :) 
It is really a hard process, especially when you happen to be just starting your life in your early 20s.

1oete7q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchy101/comments/1oete7q/anarchist_parenting_adhd_and_special_needs/,"Anarchist Parenting, ADHD and special needs","I recently, well, discovered that i apparently am an anarchist. I recently also became a dad, to a now 16 month year old, ridiculously handsome boy. And, naturally, i am wondering how the hell i am supposed to raise a child properly. From day one i was looking for advice on what the hell i should do, given how clueless i am about child-raising.   
Worse, for most of my life i was pretty clueless about functioning myself, only after a several-month-long stay in a psych ward and ongoing therapy i started to get a bit of a grip on myself. I got diagnosed as a young child with ""a model case of ADHD"" back in the 90s, and it has influenced my life in a pretty bad way, resulting, among other stuff, major depression. 

I want to bring up my boy in a good way. Not primarily as a ""productive member of the workforce"", geared at the market, but  as a happy and free human being. Anarchist, non-hierarchical principles seem pretty ideal for that, and i honestly do not think of values like thinking for oneself, questioning authority or solidarity as ""imposing political views on a child"".   
But, given my experiences, i know first hand how hard it was to learn to regulate myself, to learn discipline not for the sake of discipline but to not just lie around and rot. Many approaches that emphazise the values i mentioned above would have been less than benefitial to me as a child, i am sure. Take Montessori. For me, that would have just been a recipe for selfsabotage.   
  
Now, it is impossible to diagnose a toddler with ADHD, but given that it is highly hereditary, and my dad definitly had it, there is a good possibility my boy does too. And even if he does not, my boy is just one side of the medal, and right now, i am more concerned about the other one: Me. I simply struggle to even imagining stradling that divide between ""gentle parenting"" and what i feel is the need for some form of structure, preferably without authority.   
  
My major problem though is managing my own frustration and respecting my kid and his autonomy when, for example, we have somewhere to go, but he desperatly wants to stay on the swing, indefenitly, it seems. That i feel i can not really rationally explain something to a one and a half year old does not help, as does the fact that my tolerance fro frustration is maddening low (which is for me to work on, not for him, but it does  not make the situation easier). I'll never hit my son, and i, mostly sucessfully, give my best to not scream at him (dunking my head in a bucket of cold water has become my go-to when i cant take being screamed at anymore, but i have also resortedto less healthy reactions from time to time). But i often just pick the boy up and do what i think needs to be done even if he is kicking and screaming, be it changing a diaper, dressing him or dragging him away from the playground, so i would not say that any form of violence is completly out of the question. I would like it to be, though. Well, ""no"" is his favorite word right now, so at least he seems to starts speaking truth to power. I would prefer it to not be said power, though. 

I already had a quick look at the Anarchists FAQ section on parenting, but the fact that a lot of it seems to be based on Wilhelm Reich puts me off a little bit. I am pretty allergic to pseudoscience, and i struggle to sperate that from any useful stuff he might have said, and that the section on him in tha AFAQ does not seem to call that weird or blatantly esotheric stuff out very openly does not help me. Other suggestions are over a century old, like essays by Goldman, and even though some content might stay relevant, i would prefer a more modern perspective wherever possible. I also heard about one, or several, episodes of the Coffee with Comrades podcast and plan on giving them a look.... a listen?

*On a sidenote: I often get the answer to questions like those above that i just love my kid, be compassionate, respectful and helpful, etc., but that honestly feels a bit empty to me, given that i can look around in my family and see loving and compassionate parents everywhere, from my own to my grandparents, uncles and aunts, that still managed to royally botch the job. Some managed to rebound later in life, but oftentimes it seems a lot of damage has been done by that point.* 

  
**So: Has any of you experiences, advice or ressources that could help me get a bit of a grip on this parenting thing (especially when it comes to how I myself should conduct myself) from a libertarian/anarchist, non-authoritarian perspective or from a perspective that aligns with those values?**

best part is speed. have idea monday, live tuesday, meaningful data by friday. old process was 6+ weeks IF it got prioritized at all

advice if you're stuck in similar spot:

stop waiting for engineering permission. there are tools now that let marketing own this stuff. you understand messaging and users better than devs anyway

show roi before asking budget. way easier to get tool approved when you've already generated extra $8k/month

seriously if lack of dev resources is blocking you that's solvable now. go solve it

&nbsp;

🖤🖤 Dear fellow weirdos, seekers, and would-be sorcerers, 🖤🖤

This sub gets a steady stream of ""How do I start?"" or ""Which book is the real one?"" posts. I get it, and honestly, keep them coming.

Chaos magic is total freedom and that freedom is paralyzing to so many. If you've done any time in religion, academia, or the corporate world, you're trained to look for handrails, a definitive guide, checklists, for someone to say: ""you're doing it right"". 

Chaos magic(k), in its perverse genius, rips those out and laughs dangerously like an unhinged spider monkey. Here, in the chaos, only *you* can affirm you've got it ""right"". It's mind-boggling, fear-inducing, and awe-striking.

Let me put it plainly: **There is no right way.** There is no badge, handrails, initiation, or old white-guy gang signs to prove you're an insider. You're here to set yourself on fire and become your own bonfire against the dark. That means you're the only thing worth sacrificing.

But... you *must burn*. I choose to burn as fucking bright as I can for as long as I can. If this sounds like finding a home (or something you'd like to move toward), welcome home. 🖤

&nbsp;

##### Why Beginners Flail 

Most people, when given a blank page, freeze. They think, ""What if I screw it up?"". 

Chaotes (chaos magic(k) practitioners) see that blank page and drool at the possibilities, the various ways we can fuck it up. Fuck around and find out as belief system.

That's chaos magic's killer feature. It's a sandbox. Nobody's grading you except you, and even then, you *should be cheating*.

You don't need permission to begin. You don't need a book, a lineage, an astral degree, or a multi-thousand dollar altar of perfectly arranged bespoke laser engraved candles and ritual tools.

You just need to *start*, take the step and find out. That's it. That's the whole test.

&nbsp;

##### What the Hell Am I Supposed to Do?

**Well, first:** Stop worrying about the ""right"" way, and start treating this like a series of experiments. Magic, especially chaos magick, is just punk rock occultism.

Try things. Document your fuck-ups as well as your successes. Remember to laugh when you set your metaphorical eyebrows on fire. That's how you learn.

If you desperately need a structure, invent/borrow/steal one. Make a ritual to brush your teeth. Design your own tarot. Write prayers to the gods of traffic lights. There's no magic police that'll arrest you for writing your own grimoires. Well, at least not yet...

**Secondly:** Start anywhere. If you're not sure where to start, here are some fun frist experiments:

* Make a sigil for something ridiculous: ""May I always find socks with no holes."" - Make some god awful symbol (sigil) on paper, burn it, **forget it happened**... See what happens. 
* Pretend to worship a self-made god: Three weeks... Take the deity deadly seriously, then worship its inverse just as seriously, then don't at all. Note which version felt more potent. What part did? Use what felt powerful.
* Set an intention with a dice roll: ""If it lands on six, I'll get some sign today for XYZ."" - Then, watch your brain bend over backwards to see signs everywhere. Did you see any? If not, that means something too.
* Journal your results: This is all a grimoire is. And not because you have to, but because in six months, reading your own deranged experiments is better than most other grimoires out there.

The entire point is *play* with intent. You're learning your own language of meaning, not cramming for a Catholic catechism.

If you get results that make you question your sanity, congrats. If you get nothing but static, welcome to the other half of the spectrum. Document it all. Your future self will either laugh or find the patterns you missed.

**Third:** There is no third point really... Go read the Principia Discordia (again?) or anything from the Church of the SubGenius. It's free and online. It'll remind you to keep a sense of humor in front. Humor isn't the most important thing, but it keeps you grounded.

Enjoy being a gremlin. Remember, *a sandbox or a box of legos*, not a museum. Fuck around and find out.

&nbsp;

##### On Teachers, Gatekeepers, Books, and Gurus

**For Teachers and Gurus:** Let's get this out of the way: Most chaos magicians you meet, *myself included*, are just more experienced **guessers**. They're winging it, but with better poker faces, weirder stories, and ""a e s t h e t i c s"". Anyone claiming ""the one true method"" is either selling you something, recruiting, or making a poor attempt at being Aleister Crowley's reincarnation (visit their Patreon [here]() for more information and a 30-day course). Don't fall for this.

**For Books:** They are just logs of another's journey, and should be used for new ideas. No dogmas or blueprints. Take what's useful, discard what sucks, remix the rest. Books are good and there are plenty of threads on them here, but by all means ask for recommendations. However, use them as starting points, not gospels.

**And don't even get me started on Gatekeepers:** The people most desperate to tell you ""you're not doing real magick"" are usually the ones who haven't made anything work except their own ego trip. However, when somebody doubts you, welcome it as a chance to reassess regardless. stay_humble_dos_equis.jpg

&nbsp;

##### What I Wish Someone Had Told Me

Here's few things I wish somebody told me plainly, up front:

* *Ancient or modern doesn't matter.* If you want a trickster archetype and feel like the Joker or TNG's Q are what work **for you**, so be it. They are as valid as Loki, Lugh, or Set.
* If it's not a little scary and confusing, you're stagnant or deluded. ""Scary"" means new and/or something you give power to. Fabulous, use that.
* Your beliefs will mutate. Outstanding. That's the engine. If they aren't, you're stagnant or some kind of modern day Gandalf-level chaote (lol... *right*).
  * Your beliefs are rental agreements, break the lease when the rats move in.
* You will change your mind a hundred times, *this gets worse over time and experience*. Excellent.
* Nobody else can tell you what is right as a certainty. Only you can when your brain has that almost audible ""click"" or other [frisson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frisson) that means ""this is right and correct"".
  * On a slightly related note: If somebody else shares a spell/whatever they report works amazingly, the odds are *it may not work for you*. Them's the breaks. You can sometimes tweak it with your personality or write your own. But they seldomly work for me.
* There is no graduation. Just more improvising and laughter when the universe mishears your spell and delivers a frog instead of a prince.
* Failing is normal. *Actually*, if you're not failing a good amount, you're just doing dinner theater for one.
* The nanosecond something you've established and known to work stops working... Think about what may have gone wrong right then and write it down. Step back a few days and think with new eyes, and look back at your previous notes.
  * If it continues to not work: *Change.* Bring in some chaos. The needed change could be a single small thing like a different time of day, to a different deity, to a new from-scratch sigil, or even an entirely new framework.
  * Remember to document as much as you can.
* You can start over any time, in any way, with any tools. Create your practice brick by brick, find your gnosis (knowledge) experiment by experiment, and tools piece by piece.
  * Example: In a pinch, out of desperation, I've done spells that have worked with just tools found in a hospital cafeteria. Which I used again years later.

&nbsp;

##### General Practical Advice (aka How to Survive the Wilderness)

Tips after 20+ years of doing chaos magic. Note, again, that I'm *not an authority*, I know as much as you about what will work for you:

* *Document your process.* - The only ""grimoire"" that matters is the one you build.
* *Don't worship your tools.* - They're props. Use what works, laugh at what doesn't.
* *Build your own lineage.* - You can trace your ""teacher"" through memes, mushrooms, nightmares, or the guy at the bus stop. It's all raw material.
* *Be kind to yourself, if you're new or an old hand.* - The spell felt perfect, you felt the magick ""click"". But it didn't work... Keep in mind, sometimes things aren't ready yet outside you. Maybe the collective unconscious said no, it could be you did the spell on a full stomach, or perhaps some unconscious guilt snuck into your curse and it backfired. It's not all your fault. So, be kind to yourself and try again.
* *If it works, it works. If it doesn't, change it.* - Simple.
* *Don't take yourself too seriously.* - The only true sin in chaos magic(k) is mistaking the signpost for the destination and hardening into something corruptible and anti-gnostic.

&nbsp;

##### How to Keep Both Feet on Earth

If you find yourself talking to streetlights, journaling every crow, and seeing cosmic significance in spilled coffee, take a day off. Magic should open new doors, not lock you in a conspiracy escape room. Every so often, stop, breathe, and do something boring: laundry, spreadsheets, literal dirt-under-your-nails gardening. Magic is great, but you still live in a meat suit that needs water and tax forms.

Have at least one friend who doesn't care about magic at all. If you start explaining to them why the Greek deity Poseidon is haunting your dishwasher completely seriously, and they glaze over or look at you with ""*the look*"" it might be time for a reality break. It's ok to break for a bit and touch grass.

This is a pretty big related red flag... It's inevitable that at some point you might want to quit your current life/everything and try to do magic(k) exclusively, especially dreams of selling magic or leading your own group. Almost every pagan/witch/chaote/wiccan/etc I've ever known has had this impulse, including me, some even tried to make it work. Know now that money and power over others are powerful egregores (thoughtforms) *will* fuck with your brain. It'll get you to do things that seem unthinkable now.

Please know, I'm not telling you to not follow those dreams. If you think you can thread that needle, try. But remember, money and power (if you think of them as their own being, like a deity) ***FUCKING HATE*** gnosis/truth/reality, and you will be tempted constantly to sacrifice your connection to it for more money and power. It's a spiral of shit until you're somebody you hate. I, personally, have found that if I remove the profit motive by releasing things I make as public domain ([CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)), or at least [CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/), it keeps me sane and grounded.

&nbsp;

##### If You're Still Reading, You're Probably Ready

The fact that you're looking for handrails means you're smart enough to know you're lost. The fact that you're frustrated means you care enough to do the work. The only thing left is to actually jump in. So, here's your permission slip and your flaming sword.

***Go set some boundaries on fire.***

&nbsp;

##### Ritual of Permission: You're Already In

*If you yearn for someone to ""grant you access,"" or tell you ""you're ready"", consider this your hand-stamped ticket...*

There's no secret cabal. No pope. No celestial HR department.    
You are allowed to *begin*.       
You are allowed to *invent*.    
You are allowed to *discard everything* that doesn't work for you,     
Especailly if it's in a ""classic"" book.     
You are allowed to get it *wrong and call that research*.    
*As above, so below.*

***Time for you to go cause trouble. Now. That's an order.***

&nbsp;

I leave you with a quote (emph mine):

>My dearest, I will now explain the only safe and true formula, the destroyer of the darkness of the World, the most secret among all secrets. Let it be secret to they who would attain. Let it cover any period of time, depending on their conception. **There is no qualification, nor ritual or ceremony.** Their very existence symbolising all that is necessary to perfection. **Most emphatically, there is no need of repetition or feeble imitation.** You are alive!"" - Austin Osman Spare ""[The Book of Pleasure (Self-love)](https://hermetic.com/spare/pleasure)""

I hope this entire thing helped somebody in some way. If you have questions for me, please don't hesitate to ask below.

1oetbgc,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiddengeneticdiseases/comments/1oetbgc/anybody_else_have_genetic_diseases_they_never/,Anybody else have genetic diseases they never knew they had till too late?,"I just read an article about chronic disease or illness fakers.  I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

1oet7un,https://i.redd.it/gh1zdkt441xf1.jpeg,"Amy’s Diary — Thursday: Smoothies, Kindness & Halloween Coming Soon!","This morning, the school’s hallway felt busier than usual. Posters were everywhere — not just about the Coffee Day video, but about Halloween! Orange and purple decorations already hung on the notice boards. Someone even put little paper bats above the science lab door.

I spotted Carmen at the bulletin board, grinning ear to ear.
“Guess what, Amy!” she said, waving a bright orange flyer.

> 🎃 Next week: Halloween Celebration & Smoothie Charity Day!
Proceeds go to the Children’s Health Fund, sponsored by Coffee Day!



“Wait—Coffee Day’s involved again?!” I gasped.
Carmen nodded. “Zoe called the principal yesterday! She said your SisterBean crew inspired her to turn fun into kindness.”

By lunchtime, everyone was talking about it.
Winfrey said, “This is perfect — happiness and charity.”
Penny added, “And costumes! I already bought pumpkin earrings!”
Even Siu Ling from another class joined in: “I’m going as a vampire barista!”

After class, we met Zoe and her staff outside the school gate. She was holding a basket full of little smoothie bottle samples with Halloween stickers — ghosts, pumpkins, and even one that said ‘Boo-berry Banana!’
Zoe smiled warmly. “You girls started something bigger than you think. So Coffee Day will match every ringgit raised next Friday for the hospital fund.”

Amy nearly bounced with joy. “Really?! That’s amazing!”
Zoe winked. “Well, you’ve taught me that good vibes spread faster than caffeine.”

Haruka handed each of us a mini “Smoothie Hero” badge. Mr. Tanaka said he’d handle logistics for the charity booth and that even Ayaka and Anastasia were sewing special Coffee Day Halloween aprons.

That night at home, Mom and my sisters were already talking about costume ideas.
Shelley said, “I’m dressing as a gothic singer!”
Linda grinned. “I’ll be a witch with a smoothie wand.”
Jennifer teased, “And Amy… you’ll probably be the ‘Pumpkin Queen’ of the day.”

I laughed so hard that my stomach hurt.
It’s funny — just a few weeks ago, we were laughing about Oktoberfest and coffee ads, and now we’re planning a Halloween charity with Coffee Day.

Hi there thanks for reading my post this is a very long post please read it in full before messaging me.  I am a very genuine person please don’t be shy to message me! 

I am an English guy from the south of England originally 

I want to make it clear that I’m not conservative or religious the way I am is my own personal choices I’ve made in life! It’s how I’ve chosen to be! But I do have as explained further down morals and values I live by 

Any women from the USA or Canada please message me I want to hear from you I love your accents I really don’t mind where you are located don’t let the distance put you off 

If you only want to be friends then that’s fine with me too send me a message also I really don’t mind I’d prefer to be friends with women again aged 25-35 that would be great too! 

I’d also like to hear from Asian women too! 

If you leave any rude or critical comments ln this post you will be blocked 

I am posting many times because I really am very serious about finding someone! I have been on my own way too long now I do not mind where you are located 

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone please be aged between 25 and 35 thanks and please don't be shy to send me a message 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I’m really not interested I don’t know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I’m now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps. 

I just haven't found a woman that is suitable enough for me yet to want to be in a relationship with 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. 

You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. And please have maturity and decency.

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy.

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love to have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking  often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I’ve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. I could never cheat on someone that I loved and cared about 

I need a strong emotional and intellectual connection with someone as well this is very important to me also as well as being intimate it’s not just about being intimate 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it’s an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I’ve been to and we have the lovely île de re island nearby I have been there many times it’s also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it’s certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know. I also love soft rock some of the bands  love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I’ve seen most of my favourite bands live too I’ve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it’s my favourite but I only have it in moderation I’ve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way.  

It’s very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after.

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test having a car is way too expensive and i have never been that interested in driving. 

I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I am taking a break from work I am in a new country learning the language is my focus at the moment.
I’m not lazy or anything like that and I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I’ve had trouble finding suitable work which was hard In England 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe. 

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

My body Is not lean muscular athletic I am natural I have a real man's body which has some fat on it. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I’m not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won’t be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don’t fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I’m very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I’m in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I’m always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don’t aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don’t watch reality tv. I don’t watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it’s how I’ve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I’d never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don’t wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I’d prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don’t wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy.

Hi there thanks for reading my post this is a very long post please read it in full before messaging me. 

I am an English guy 

Any women from the USA or Canada please message me I want to hear from you I love your accents I really don’t mind where you are located don’t let the distance put you off 

If you leave any rude or critical comments ln this post you will be blocked 

I am posting many times because I really am very serious about finding someone! I have been on my own way too long now I do not mind where you are located 

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone please be aged between 25 and 32 thanks and please don't be shy to send me a message 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I’m really not interested I don’t know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I’m now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps. 

I just haven't found a woman that is suitable enough for me yet to want to be in a relationship with 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. 

You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. And please have maturity and decency.

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first

1oet618,https://www.reddit.com/r/animinneapolis/comments/1oet618/otaku_eats_surviving_mage_on_ramen_energy_drinks/,"Otaku Eats: Surviving M.A.G.E. on Ramen, Energy Drinks, and Con-Snacks","https://preview.redd.it/c68uut9j31xf1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=99c08b47b5daf926bbbb01577f564e1a2a742a63

You’re spending Halloween weekend at [M.A.G.E. 2025](https://magemsp.com/about) — that’s **October 31 to November 2 at the Hyatt Regency in downtown Minneapolis** — and between all the cosplay, gaming, panels, and late-night chaos, you’re going to need to eat. The problem? Con weekends have a way of turning otherwise functional adults into snack-gremlins running on fumes, ramen, and energy drinks.

If you’ve ever survived a convention before, you already know the food struggle is real. Between the hotel prices, crowded cafés, and the sheer temptation of surviving on Pocky alone, eating like a human being becomes surprisingly complicated. But M.A.G.E. actually gives you options — from free food in the ConSweet to decent restaurants nearby — if you know where to look and how to plan.

**The ConSweet: Free Food, Free Mayhem**

Let’s start with the MVP: **the ConSweet**. M.A.G.E. actually feeds you — kind of. You’ll find **free ramen, rice, and soda** available for all attendees, which is an absolute lifesaver at 1 a.m. when you’re broke and delirious. The ConSweet is exactly what it sounds like: a communal space full of hungry fans slurping noodles like it’s a competitive sport.

It’s not fancy, but it’s dependable. If you’re strategic, you can make it work — bring a refillable bottle, your own utensils, and maybe toss some instant miso packets or freeze-dried veggies in your bag for a little upgrade. Think of it as con-level meal prep.

Timing matters, though. Right after big events like the [Grand Costume Contest](https://magemsp.com/cosplay) or **Late-Night Dance**, lines get ridiculous. Hit it during odd hours — between panels or early in the afternoon — and you’ll actually find a seat.

**Hotel Eats and Quick Fixes**

The [Hyatt Regency](https://magemsp.com/location) is right in downtown Minneapolis, which means you’ve got options beyond instant noodles. The hotel itself usually offers grab-and-go snacks, sandwiches, and coffee that doesn’t taste like punishment. Expect higher prices, but you’re paying for convenience — especially if you don’t want to walk around in full cosplay looking for a burrito at midnight.

Downtown Minneapolis has a solid mix of food nearby. Within a few blocks, you’ll find **fast-food staples** (Chipotle, Jimmy John’s, McDonald’s) and **casual local spots** where you can sit down for something resembling a balanced meal.

If you’re looking for something a little more indulgent, there are great spots like **The Local**, an Irish pub with hearty food; **Hell’s Kitchen**, which is open for breakfast and has legendary pancakes; or **Naf Naf Grill**, a reliable place for Mediterranean wraps and bowls. For families, **Crave** and **Pizza Luce** are good bets — kid-friendly, casual, and walking distance from the hotel.

**Con Snack Strategy: Fuel Like You Mean It**

Every con veteran has a survival stash, and it’s not just because they’re thrifty — it’s because waiting in food lines eats up valuable event time. Pack **granola bars, nuts, jerky, instant oatmeal, and electrolyte packets**. You don’t have to be fancy; just be prepared.

Energy drinks are everywhere at M.A.G.E., but don’t make them your primary source of hydration unless you enjoy headaches and heart palpitations. Keep a **refillable water bottle** with you and actually use it — dehydration is a real threat when you’re running on excitement and no sleep.

If you’re rooming with friends, bring a **small cooler or mini-fridge stash** — fruit cups, yogurt, or even pre-made sandwiches go a long way when you can’t deal with lines or prices. And if you’re cosplaying? Eat something before you put on anything complicated. No one wants to pass out under three layers of EVA foam.

**Late-Night Cravings and After-Event Eats**

M.A.G.E. runs events until at least **2 a.m.**, so yes, you’ll get hungry at ungodly hours. The ConSweet helps, but you can also plan ahead for post-event munchies. There are **24-hour spots** in downtown Minneapolis, like **Pizza Lucé**, and if you’re desperate, food delivery apps are your best friend. Just be mindful — Halloween weekend in downtown means high demand and surge pricing, so maybe order before the rave starts rather than after.

Some of the **room parties** even have snacks or themed treats. Don’t rely on it, but it’s a nice bonus if you’re socializing late. Just remember: moderation is your friend, especially if you plan to make it to morning panels without feeling like a zombie.

**What You’re Eating** ***For***\*\*: The Events That Keep You Moving\*\*

M.A.G.E. isn’t just about food — it’s the reason you’ll forget to eat in the first place. The schedule’s packed, and [every event is designed to pull you in](https://magemsp.com/events). If you’re new, here’s what you’ll be running between meals for:

* **Cosplay Contests:** Easily one of the biggest highlights. Expect professional-level craftsmanship, hilarious skits, and fans who turn fabric into magic. The **Grand Costume Contest** has serious competition categories — Best Performance, Best Craftsmanship, and Best in Show — so it’s a must-watch.
* **Artist Alley and Vendor Hall:** Also known as *The Wallet Trap*. Rows of art, fan merch, and collectibles you’ll convince yourself you “need.” Bring cash, stay hydrated, and maybe eat something before shopping — hanger makes for bad budgeting decisions.
* **Video Gaming Room:** A nonstop setup of consoles, fighters, shooters, and retro classics. You can jump into tournaments or just play casually. Great place to meet people — or lose hours if you’re not careful.
* **Tabletop Gaming:** The vibe here is chill and social. You can drop in for board games, one-shot RPGs, or even **life-size Catan**. Snacks are practically required; nobody wants to pause mid-game for a food run.
* **Maid Café:** Buy your ticket on-site and get the full experience — tea, snacks, and interactive performances. The servers (maids and butlers) play games with guests and serve desserts, so it’s part meal, part theater, all fun.
* **Escape from the Cabin of the Cackling Man:** A horror-themed escape room with 80s retro-gaming energy and creepypasta vibes. Bring your brain, not your hunger — it’s hard to solve puzzles when you’re thinking about pizza.
* **Concerts and Late-Night Dances:** The **Formal Fantasy Ball** and main-stage EDM raves are legendary. These run into the early morning, so if you’re planning to dance all night, eat something carb-heavy beforehand and keep a bottle of water with you.
* **Room Parties:** These are part of M.A.G.E.’s culture — attendee-run gatherings where fans host themed parties, games, or mini events in their hotel rooms (approved by staff, of course). Snacks are common, drinks flow, and it’s a great way to meet people. Just remember to pace yourself — both with the socializing and the snacks.

**Family-Friendly Dining Tips**

If you’re bringing kids or younger fans, the Hyatt’s location is perfect. The hotel’s restaurant offers simple meals, and nearby food spots like **Chipotle** and **Five Guys** are safe bets for quick, no-fuss eats. The **ConSweet** is kid-friendly too, but you’ll want to supervise — boiling water and hyper kids don’t mix.

Families can also take advantage of nearby grocery stores or Target for supplies. Bringing snacks and fruit saves a ton of time and money, especially for younger attendees who get hungry every ten minutes.

**Tickets: Buy Early, Eat Better**

If you haven’t locked in your pass yet, do it early. A [weekend badge](https://magemsp.com/register) is currently **$40**, while a **day pass** is **$30**, and a **Sunday pass** is **$15**. There’s also a **VIP option** for $150 if you’re the type who likes skipping lines and scoring exclusive access.

Buying early not only saves you cash — it also means you can budget more for food and merch instead of paying full price at the door. More ramen money, basically.

**Real Talk: How to Survive the Weekend**

Here’s the deal — three-day conventions like M.A.G.E. are marathons disguised as parties. You’ll get tired, hungry, and probably forget what a vegetable looks like by Saturday. But with a little planning, you’ll make it through without hitting the “post-con crash” too hard.

* **Hydrate constantly.** Water refills are free. Headaches and dehydration aren’t worth it.
* **Eat actual meals** when you can — something with protein and carbs once a day does wonders.
* **Pack snacks** and stash them in your bag. Even a single granola bar can save you mid-panel.
* **Don’t skip breakfast,** even if it’s just instant oats in your hotel room.
* **Rest when you can.** You don’t want to miss Sunday because you partied too hard Saturday.

Think of food as part of your game plan, not an afterthought. You can’t enjoy the **cosplay, panels, or concerts** if you’re dizzy from running on fumes.

M.A.G.E. is a full-sensory experience — the lights, the music, the fandom energy, the crowds. But between the panels and the parties, take care of yourself. Eat something decent, drink some water, and pace your caffeine intake like a pro. Because when the weekend’s over and everyone else is posting con photos, you’ll be one of the few who looks alive.",1,1761298111.0,animinneapolis,0,1.0,False
1oet5m7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1oet5m7/aitah_for_cutting_off_my_bestfriend_after_her/,AITAH for cutting off my bestfriend after her girlfriend cheated on her?,"A few years ago my best friend came out to me, of course, I was super happy for her. She started dating a girl and since she was busy with her new relationship, I put myself out there to make some new friends. One of the girls I became close to just so happened to be friends with my best friend’s girlfriend.
We all hung out together at first, but my best friend and her girlfriend would ditch us to go hangout alone. Eventually, me and this new friend became close. One night, while drunk, she told me my best friend’s girlfriend was cheating on her. I was in a really tough spot because I liked this new friendship, but I knew I needed to tell my best friend. A few days later, at a sleepover, my best friend mentioned that she suspected her girlfriend was cheating, so I told her it was happening— without giving names or details of my source. A few days after that, her girlfriend started blowing up my phone, cussing me out calling me every name she could think of. All I said was “ you’re a bottom of the barrel hoe” and blocked her. A few days after that my best friend came over and basically said she wasn’t gonna pick side— which basically meant she was staying with her girlfriend. She also made it clear that our friendship was over. Because of this, I also lost the friend who told me about the cheating, since I stuck my neck out. I called my best friend a bad friend, two words I never thought I would say to her,and cut all ties with her.

A few days ago, she reached out saying she’d love to get coffee with me sometime, and that she wanted to hang out. I told her something along the lines of, thanks but no thanks,and that that I wasn’t interested. Don’t get me wrong, I still miss her, and our friendship. But I don’t think I could be friends with somebody, who is willing to do something that I would never ever even consider doing to them.

We do not like sports, but I've already accepted this is bug in the city. No worries. Same with traffic. Nashville driving might be the worst in the nation. Seriously. COL is also insane here. Million dollar houses that are a Milwaukee $400,000 at best. And taxes for goods and service? Nearly 10% here, plus tax on all the food from the grocery store. Weather in A2 I've also heard complain of, but I'm from Wisconsin, I'll be ok 😆.
What other thoughts does anyone have? 
I'm also wondering which areas are ""walkable"" ie to a coffee shop or store with two senior dogs. I get the feeling that only downtown and Kerrytown are the only neighborhoods like this? I don't drive, so it's important for me to be able to get to things. 
Thanks so much!

1oet514,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oet514,End game (for now) station advice,"Here's my cramped coffee station. Went from the profitec GO to the Lelit Bianca V3 and the DF54 to the Eureka XL. Built up some nice equipment, mostly from Clive coffee. Could use advice on how to make it look prettier. Y'all have some really nice looking, aesthetic setups. I use this counter since it's gets pretty messy and I like to be near the sink for easy clean up. 

 I want keep the stagg on the counter but I don't want it to get dusty. I just got it, so it's still in the box thought it might work stored like that but that looks like coffee store, not a station. Advice would be welcomed and appreciated 

 I don't really wanna put the Bianca right beside the microwave instead of in the corner because the fridge covers it up from that angle and I can slide it over easily to the sink to refill the water. I also really like to be able to see it from the living room. See last picture. What do you guys think? Should I put more stuff out of sight? Organize it differently?

Also, in case anyone is thinking of buying anything from Clive coffee I have a referral code for $15 off your purchase and I get $15 too 😉

1oet2tk,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_EGGIE1205/comments/1oet2tk/chapter_2_new_companions_part_2/,Chapter 2 New Companions Part 2,"Now, let’s examine the intriguing results of our research.

Even though this was a reward for Diablo, assembling almost a thousand bodies was still a monumental project. I wanted to build a magisteel doll like Beretta and replicate it with ‘Wisdom KingRaphael.’ But that would be dull. That said, it also wasn’t feasible to build each one from scratch. It was then that I unexpectedly thought of a better alternative: create a workshop that could mass-produce them.

I prepared a one meter wide, three-meter-high transparent cylinder made of tempered glass. I officially named it the Growth Capsule. As the name implied, the goal was to grow entities such as monsters inside them.

The capsule would be filled with the water I had stored in my ‘Stomach’ from the underground lake within the ‘Sealed Cave.’ Since the lake water contained a high concentration of magicules, I decided to name it “magiwater.” It could be added to fortify our Tempest potions or even restore mana in humans. The useful properties it exhibited had a wide variety of potential applications.

The growth capsule had a pipe fitting that allowed additional magicules to be added. By inserting supplementary magicules, the density of the magiwater increased, which subsequently improved the chances of spawning a monster.

When the concentration of the magiwater dropped below the minimum threshold, the capsule would automatically refill with magicules in order to revert this change.

I prepared one thousand growth capsules. When I had finished assembling them, I suddenly realized it would have been much more convenient to simply build one thousand dolls from scratch—well, don’t sweat the small stuff. That was my belief. The point was to be romantic enough. After all, I was delighted to have worked on my project and had zero regrets.

The hall was now filled with growth capsules. Magnificent.

In order to spawn monsters, specific conditions must be met first—it was thanks to our recent research that we had discovered this fact. Otherwise, no matter how many magicules we pumped into the filled capsule, no monster would spawn. However, if you were to combine certain factors, then you attained the ability to spawn strong monsters as a result.

For instance, if we threw a snake into the capsule, the dense magicule concentration would poison it to death. Regardless, its flesh would combine with the magiwater and be rebuilt as a tempest serpent. And as a result, an A-minus ranked monster would be created. Now, you probably have some idea of just how incredible the growth capsule was.

It was evident that monsters produced from the growth capsule were several times stronger than their original counterparts. The reason these monsters were so strong was likely due to the fact that they were born in a stable, lab-controlled environment filled with magicules.

Despite this, sometimes an individual’s body would break down upon birth and quickly die. Whether these monsters could survive was all down to luck.

There was still room for improvement, and I planned on taking advantage of the growth capsule’s properties to generate the necessary thousand bodies.

“Well then, how’s progress coming along?” I inquired.

“Quite fine! I’ve also been doing a lot of research lately!” Ramiris cheerfully replied.

“Ho? Then I’ll be looking forward to—eh, what the hell is that?!”

I got spooked upon noticing the floating object inside the growth capsule. It was almost hard to believe; a complete one-eighty from what I’d expected.

For my original plan, only the skeletons of the one thousand bodies would be crafted out of magisteel, and then they would be submerged in the magicule medium. Theoretically speaking, the skeleton would be used as the foundation to form a bone golem.

Since the framework was artificial, there was little possibility of their bodies decaying. There wouldn’t be any soul possessing the bodies, either. Only the magicules in the liquid would crystalize on the skeletons. The probability that the bodies would abruptly gain self-consciousness was theoretically zero.

Unlike when I had created Beretta, they did not require detailed modelling. The demons planning to acquire the bodies would no doubt use their own magicules to alter their appearance to suit personal tastes.

At least that was how I initially envisioned it…

Within the one thousand growth capsules were humanoid dolls drifting in them. However, various measures were taken to implement each essential body part. The most eye-catching one was the central component. Inside their chest was the artificial representation for the heart, the pumping ‘Spirit Magic Core.’

“This is…”

“I came up with the idea! If they have a strong enough core, the monsters would probably be even stronger,” Ramiris casually revealed with a smirk.

In layman’s terms, it was already very difficult to prepare one thousand ‘Spirit Magic Cores.’ It wouldn’t take me too long to craft them, but with a lack of interest and passion, I considered it a chore and didn’t have the motivation to make them. That was why I wanted to resort to something simpler. Yet, Ramiris was apparently too stubborn to compromise. Looks like she did the work the traditional way to prepare the portions for one thousand bodies.

They even had ‘Emulated Souls’ installed. It seemed that the technology to possess a homunculus from Sarion was also being utilized here.

Although Beretta easily possessed his body, if it were Treyni-san’s sisters, they presumably would struggle to achieve the same result. With that being said, using ‘Emulated Souls’ was probably the right choice.

On the downside, this would obviously have led to a ton of work… No wonder why she complained about the lack of manpower.

“Ramiris-sama’s ideas were wonderful and truly intriguing. When I saw what she was trying to integrate, it would’ve been *impossible* not to assist her endeavor,” Vesta explained with distant eyes.

That was only natural. With the sheer amount of stuff here, he could have gotten as much data as he wanted.

These fist-sized ‘Spirit Magic Cores’ were all top-quality products. When combined with the skeletons I had built, the alteration greatly differed from my original design. There were even enchantments on the metallic bones. As magicules enveloped the skeleton, they began materializing as muscle tissue. We could further observe the process of how monsters were born.

I finally understood why Vesta considered sleeping a waste of valuable time.

“How about it? Aren’t these all super fascinating?”

“GAHAHAHA, seeing that expression on Rimuru’s face has already made it worth our time!”

Ramiris and Veldora were visibly pleased with themselves.

“Yes, it’s very interesting…but did Ramiris really come up with this?”

“Of course! Well, how about it? What do you think?!”

Apart from shouting her line, Ramiris also proudly puffed out her chest.

*Mhm, you can show off all you want this time. This is truly extraordinary stuff.*

While Ramiris looked a bit ditzy at first glance, she was still intelligent. She was highly knowledgeable about spirit engineering to the point of mastery, and right now she was also learning about magic science. I heard that she’d been visiting level ninety-five quite frequently.

She didn’t just idle around during her immense, cyclic lifespan. Her proficiency in the laws of physics was exceptional. Surprisingly enough, she was fully qualified as a researcher.

*I can’t allow her appearance to deceive me*.

“Ahh, these are really impressive. And they’re all hand-crafted as well. How much work did you put in making this?”

“It was super tiring. Although they aren’t dolls with ball joints like Beretta, but rather simply bodies imitating human skeletons, if we prepare heart-emulating cores like this, I’m sure that they will absorb a large quantity of magicules when submerged in the capsule.”

I wholeheartedly agreed with a nod after listening to Ramiris’s opinion.

Thus, we now had the ability to manufacture bodies that were far stronger than I had predicted. They would be the cream of the crop.

Gazing at the vessels that were suspended in the capsules, I tried to estimate their potential strength. I suspected their magicule content would be at the top of rank A—and there were a thousand of them.

This was all thanks to the integration of ‘Spirit Magic Cores’ and ‘Emulated Souls.’

*What an incredible feat.* I was thoroughly impressed from the bottom of my heart.

  
A few days had passed since Dino’s unanticipated arrival. Diablo had yet to return, but I suspected that it was almost time. In order to complete the bodies early, I headed to the research facility today as well.

The place was bustling with activity; Ramiris was in a heated argument with Veldora.

“Like I said, I want to pour mentor’s magicules directly into the capsules to accelerate the growth!”

“But what would happen if you messed it up? Wouldn’t all the blame get pinned on me?”

*These guys are up to no good.*

Having piqued my curiosity, I concealed myself and eavesdropped on them. I had become quite skilled at hiding my presence lately. It seemed Veldora didn’t even realize I was there.

“It’s okay with so many bodies here! Moreover, I will also show support for that thing mentor wants to request from Rimuru. So pleeeese, pretty please!” Ramiris beseeched Veldora to donate some of his magicules.

*They sure are close.* I couldn’t help but smile at the scene.

By the way, what was it that Veldora wanted to request from me? I had no idea, which further piqued my curiosity.

“I just can’t get mad at you… Just remember to support me on that thing,” Veldora sighed, signaling his defeat.

“Mhm mhm, just count on me!” Ramiris hurriedly reassured.

It looked like they both came to an agreement. Veldora nodded with an ‘Mhm.’ Despite acting all pompous, his expression clearly gave away the fact that he was more than happy to do it.

On one hand, it was probably because of Ramiris’s instigation, while on the other hand, he likely would have agreed regardless.

Veldora raised his hand toward a capsule and bellowed, “HYAA!” It was quite the spectacle as he injected his magicules. The abnormally dense magicules began to swirl inside the capsule. The pressure within was so intense that it looked capable of sending the entire facility to kingdom come.

*Will this really work?*

I was a bit apprehensive but continued to quietly observe with high expectations. Even if the cylinder broke, we could still revise our course of action. Compared to that, I was more curious about what Ramiris intended to accomplish.

Within the capsule, magicules crystallized and adhered to the magisteel skeleton, like moths to a flame, forming artificial tissue. Everything followed Raphael-sensei’s plan to a T.

But with Veldora dumping a massive quantity of magicules, unexpected side effects were bound to arise. A large amount was absorbed by the skeleton and consequently caused structural modifications.

“How strange? It seems different from what I expected…” Ramiris said, perplexed.

Well, that was usually how scientific experiments went.

The material that made up the skeleton could no longer be classified as magisteel. We didn’t mix any rare elements like gold or silver in, so it was neither orichalcum nor mithril. However, in terms of yield and tensile strength, while it was not as strong as the ultimate metal, Hihiirokane, it was strong enough to rival orichalcum.

But what bothered me the most was that despite being a type of metal, it almost looked alive…

«Answer. Deducing that the wavelength of the individual ‘Veldora’ has caused its quality to improve. It is a subset of the material adamantite. Following its classification, the corresponding name is most likely dragotite.»

*I see*.

Ramiris had attempted to speed up the completion of the bodies, only to end up discovering a new, interesting metal instead.

*Hold on, looks like it’s not finished yet.*

“W-wait a second, mentor! Stop, stooop!”

“Huh? WOAHHH, there’s a crack in the capsule!”

Ramiris and Veldora both exclaimed with consternation.

*Are these two geniuses or idiots? By the look of things right now, I can’t tell for sure.*

“What are you two doing?”

In order to clean up this mess before it got any bigger, I decided to reveal myself in front of the two. And so, while working to fix the damaged capsule, we grabbed some coffee to tide us over.

We called Vesta and Dino as well and gathered together to enjoy coffee and cakes. The meal was prepared by the dryad Treyni-san.

“Tsk, we were just about to get to the good part…” Dino complained.

“Ah, so you don’t want your cake? Then I’ll give your share to Ramiris—”

“Sorry, I was just joking. No, wait. Even though what I said were my genuine feelings, it was just a slip of the tongue.”

Dino’s reaction implied that he was pissed off about being interrupted while working. Yet, when I suggested taking his cake away, he immediately lowered his head and apologized.

*Are you really okay being like this,* *Dino**-san? Are you really living up to the name “**Sleeping Ruler**”…?*

Still, seeing that he was at least putting effort in reassured me a lot.

Vesta and Dino were performing experiments together. I was told that they were recording data from the one thousand growth capsules. Additionally, when they had spare time, they left to examine Kurobee’s slotted weapons and his interchangeable magic crystal enchantments.

The reason for their sudden interest was because I bragged about it.

If the outcome of the research went well, it may even contribute to the construction of the Elemental Colossus. That explained why Vesta was eager to start his own investigation on Magic Marble Combination.

I gave Dino a couple of magic marbles as samples to play around with, while Vesta would observe and jot down detailed notes. Noticing Dino’s displeasure when I called him over to relax with us, it became obvious that he was enjoying research. It was work, but the line between work and play had blurred. Dino would go on some tangent about not wanting to be productive, yet he seemed to have already assimilated into this professional workplace without realizing.

It is imperative to enjoy your work.

Next—

As I finished the last of my coffee, I turned to face Ramiris.

“By the way, Ramiris, why were you in such a hurry to complete the bodies for possession?” I asked rather directly.

“Ah, about that…” Ramiris was dodging the question.

Coming to her aid, Treyni-san interjected, “Please hold on, Rimuru-sama. Ramiris-sama was doing this for my sisters and companions. She was simply trying her best for them!”

I didn’t mean to chide her, but Treyni-san mistook my intentions and tried very hard to defend her. She was usually like this as well. To be honest, I thought Treyni-san outright spoiled Ramiris.

“It’s not that, I just wanted to know her reasons. I’m not scolding her, don’t worry. So, why did you do it, Ramiris?”

I attempted to calm Treyni-san down and continued to question Ramiris for her rationale.

“Umm—now that I have some time to think it over, I was being too rash. These children admire me a lot, so I wanted them to get their own bodies earlier. This way, they would be happy, and we would also get extra help. The more the merrier, right?”

Ramiris was quite embarrassed as she answered.

I could empathize with her motivation. The dryads could move freely around the labyrinth without a body, whereas the treants couldn’t. Although treants retained the ability to reposition near where they were rooted, they couldn’t possibly leave the forest and enter areas without soil. Essentially, without a body, their mana would steadily dissipate over time, which was detrimental to their well-being.

The same concept applied to the dryads, where if they were too far away from their corpus, then their strength would greatly diminish as well. They were considered high tier species among the rank A monsters and much stronger than greater majins. If the same restrictions also applied to the dryads, then demanding more from the treants, a lower species, would be far too cruel.

From Ramiris’s point of view, with the dolls that were cultivated in the growth capsules, not only the dryads, but even the treants would possess the capability to effortlessly travel in the future. That was probably why she wanted to test her idea out on some of the dolls behind my back.

“If that’s the case, you could have discussed it with me. Diablo hasn’t come back yet, and there’s no telling how many subordinates that guy will bring. If there aren’t enough, we can always make more later. Let’s first prepare the bodies for the dryads,” I suggested with a genial tone.

“Can we really?” Ramiris excitedly inquired.

“Of course.”

“Thank you, Rimuru!”

She flitted around me, overjoyed.

To be fair, this decision was also made with my best interests in mind. We truly lacked the number of people necessary to operate efficiently. Treyni-san’s sisters, as well as the other dryads, were all assisting with running the labyrinth and its related matters. They were already busy enough as is and couldn’t spare any more time. If this were to continue, everyone would be overworked since administering the labyrinth required twenty-four-seven attention. That was why I desperately needed more staff to fill in the shifts.

With these state-of-the-art bodies, even the treants would rise to rank A and be able to move unhindered inside the labyrinth. Furthermore, in the rare case that their bodies were destroyed, their original corpus wouldn’t be harmed. However, they could only travel as far as their willpower allowed—in essence, only within the confines of Ramiris’s labyrinth—but that was sufficient.

As for the dryads—

“By the way, we should turn Trya-san, Triss, Alpha, and the rest of the dryads all into dryas dolls—”

“Huh?”

“Is it really okay?” Treyni-san launched her question at me with terrifying fervor, all before I could even finish my proposal.

“Can we really do that, Rimuru?” Ramiris nervously asked, completely ignoring Dino and the others who were unfortunately left out of the discussion.

“Can we do what?”

“That—evolving them into dryas doll dryads. But won’t that take a lot of work?”

“I suppose, but they’ve also contributed their fair share. I hope they will continue to help us with the labyrinth’s management in the future as well.”

“All because Rimuru-sama allowed us to live here… Since Ramiris-sama is determined to support Rimuru-sama, we naturally will follow Ramiris-sama’s wishes as her subordinates,” Treyni-san admitted.

After hearing my reply to Ramiris, Treyni-san seemed rather guilty.

With that being said, we benefited tremendously from the dryads’ involvement within the labyrinth. In a sense, this was my token of appreciation for them. I wanted to give them the opportunity to act on their own. Although it required handcrafting humanoid dolls, I was quite keen on matters involving creating dolls for beauties or bishojos.

I originally planned on using the same bodies I had prepared for Diablo, but that would seem like a cheap gesture. Dryads should use wooden dolls.

“No no no, you guys really helped out a lot, so please enjoy these. And whether they wish to directly possess these bodies or become a dryas doll dryad by possessing extra wood from their original tree host, the choice will be up to them,” I proposed to Treyni-san.

She nodded happily.

Ramiris muttered on the side, “Hey you, why are you more polite talking to Treyni-chan than to me? I won’t take that…”

But I’ll just pretend I never heard that.

  
As soon as break time was over, Vesta and the others returned to work.

“Looks like this place is beyond my field of expertise, but it’s still very fun. I’ll go finish my *work* now. Let’s go, Vesta-san.”

“Understood, Dino-sama.”

And somewhere along the line, Dino put emphasis on the word “work” as he left with Vesta.

This guy had clearly never done anything productive until he came here. He was a waste of space before, but since he’d been working hard, I would overlook his past behavior. Speaking of which, I needed to work on my own stuff as well—

“Hold on, Rimuru. I have something to ask of you. Ramiris, it’s time to fulfill your part of the bargain!”

I guessed that he was going to trouble me with something, so I was trying to run away. It appeared Veldora had been waiting for the moment right after break time ended.

“…And what is it that you need me for?”

Truthfully, I really didn’t wanna do it, but I still begrudgingly replied, nonetheless.

“Umm, the thing is—”

“Mentor said he wanted an assistant. It will be a good thing if we have more people to help, that’s why I also…well, have a favor to ask…”

Uhh, my ominous feeling came true! More hassle was headed my way…

*We’re already understaffed right now, so who could we possibly spare to be Veldora’s playmate?*

“No no no, everyone is very busy. They don’t have time to hang out with you—”

“Wait a second! Rimuru, you got it all wrong. I have been helping Ramiris and guarding the labyrinth, all very important tasks. If I can have an assistant at my side and praise me from time to time, then it will have quite the therapeutic effect. That way, I won’t be exhausted quickly,” Veldora passionately argued.

Ramiris displayed her support with vigorous nods. However, since I already heard every bit of their conversation just moments ago, I could only think “You really do stick to your end of the bargain.” But, since no one available came to mind, I would have to end that train of thought.

“No. Unfortunately—”

“Hold on, hold on, hold on—!”

I was interrupted yet again.

Veldora apparently did not want to back off. He was adamantly standing his ground.

“To be honest, when I was staying inside your ‘Stomach,’ I met someone whom I can call a friend. I hope that you can give him a body just like the ones you are preparing here,” Veldora suddenly revealed.

I was clueless. *What kind of friend are you talking about here?*

«Answer. The individual is deduced to be the greater spirit ‘Ifrit.’»

*Huh? How did Veldora befriend Ifrit?*

«Answer. Individual ‘Veldora’ intervened at the time to move Ifrit to the same isolated position during Master’s ‘Predation.’»

*I see, it is exactly what* *Raphael**-san described*.

When I consumed Ifrit from Shizu-san, he was moved to the space in my ‘Stomach’ where Veldora had been isolated. This, however, did not affect us from taking Ifrit’s data. That’s why Raphael-sensei, or ‘Great Sage’ at the time, did not resist the change and allowed it without notifying me. Since it wasn’t an inconvenience, I only discovered this fact just now. That is to say, unbeknownst to me, Veldora befriended Ifrit.

“Ahh, so you want me to revive Ifrit?”

“GAHAHAHA! As expected from Rimuru, you understood me so quickly!”

Veldora-san was delighted, but on the other hand, I had mixed feelings. Ifrit and Shizu-san were totally incompatible with each other, and he was also Demon Lord Leon’s subordinate. If I were to revive Ifrit, would he play nice? With this thought in mind, I couldn’t just agree to his proposal so easily.

“Hmm…”

“S-so that’s a no?”

“R-Rimuru, I want to ask you too! Please fulfill mentor’s wish!”

While I deliberated, Veldora gazed at me with sad puppy eyes whereas Ramiris pleaded for her mentor’s sake.

What a headache. I was quite troubled with this turn of events.

To be honest, I preferred having more people to work for us, but I just didn’t feel safe releasing Ifrit. Despite his modest appearance, he was still head and shoulders above any second-rate greater majin in terms of strength. Although we would win if he were to start a fuss, damage would be inevitable. He might even wind end up fleeing back to Leon. I wouldn’t want to wake a sleeping baby—I figured it was understandable for me to think this way.

“However, Ifrit seemed to have pledged his loyalty to Demon Lord Leon before… Are you really sure he’s willing to be your assistant after being revived?”

“Uh? Umm umm, that’s definitely the case. You don’t have to worry about it. My sincerity has moved Ifrit. That guy really is willing to be my assistant,” Veldora hurriedly reassured.

*Oi. Seriously?*

For a brief second, Veldora seemed like he was talking to someone; it had to be Ifrit himself. In other words, Veldora was communicating with him in my body in some unknown fashion.

“Were you just talking to Ifrit?”

“Yeah, I can do anything.”

“Mentor is super amazing. He asked Ifrit to summon a bunch of flame salamanders for the magitrain! That’s why we should plan for the future and make him one of our companions,” trilled Ramiris.

*I see how it is.*

Indeed, within the labyrinth itself, Ramiris could summon spirits at will with ease. However, once the magitrain commenced operations, it would be much more reassuring if someone could actually command the salamanders. *Guuhh*, I really couldn’t refuse the proposal from a profit standpoint. Moreover, Veldora personally guaranteed that he would take care of Ifrit.

*I suppose I will put my faith in Veldora.*

“All right, all right, since you are so convinced, just make sure you take responsibility for the whole thing!”

“All right, just leave it to me!”

“This is great, Mentor!”

Veldora and Ramiris were hyped up like I was going to buy them a pet or something. Hopefully, my faith in Veldora being responsible wouldn’t backfire.

“Then let’s—”

“Right, right, Rimuru. Don’t we still have the shell of the magic core of Charybdis? That contains the remainder of my mana, so it can adapt to my power easily. Ifrit has been submerged in my youki for a long time, so using that as a ‘Core’ would be better.”

According to Veldora, the compatibility would work better than an ‘Emulated Soul.’

«Answer. I agree with the views of individual ‘Veldora.’»

Since Raphael had agreed, I had no reason to object.

“Okay, then we will use this body for Ifrit to take over.”

I stood in front of the growth capsule that had just been repaired before our break.

A skeleton originally made of magisteel, which had transformed into a unique metal called dragotite, was floating inside. Inferior beings wouldn’t be able to endure the exposure to Veldora’s excessive magicules. However, since Ifrit was a greater spirit, he should be able to hold his own.

“Oh ho, this is great. That guy will be happy as well,” Veldora assured as well.

I began to execute the conversion without hesitation.

«Report. Remains of Ifrit have been discovered. Transferring to the magic core of Charybdis… Successful. Proceeding to phase two, constructing soul container… ‘Merging’ with the body made up of dragotite.»

The operation was completed in an instant.

As expected from Raphael-sensei, how masterful.

The next moment—

After Veldora, Ramiris, and I watched the body receive Ifrit’s core, its form underwent drastic changes. Muscles and blood vessels started growing on the silver black skeleton. Skin quickly formed the final layer, and just like Veldora, it had a tanned hue. Its head was veiled with wavy long hair, whose black color gave off an impressive sheen. There were highlights of red intertwined, like a burning flame was scattered within. It had golden eyes, while its dragon-like pupils glowed a deep scarlet.

Eh, no matter how you looked at it, that figure was a female. And a superb beauty as well.

“Oh oh, Ifrit, how does it feel to return to the mortal realm with a body?” commented Veldora.

Ah, so this femme fatale was undeniably Ifrit. Putting aside whether spirits really possessed genders, I explicitly remembered that it had a more *masculine* body type. How did this change happen?

“Veldora-sama, this is the first time I have seen you in this world. And Rimuru-sama, I am eternally grateful for you resurrecting me.”

Despite my confusion, Ifrit kneeled as soon as she finished speaking. I was afraid that Ifrit would rebel out of her loyalty for Leon, but it seemed that I had worried for nothing. Immense relief flooded through me.

“Oh, oh oh, I’m glad you look well. But I want to ask you something…” I wavered for a moment.

“Please ask away.”

I had so many questions. However, what I was most curious about—

“I recall that your previous look was more suited for combat, I mean, you looked a lot more agile moving around…”

*And you didn’t have gigantic breasts like those, right?*

—I didn’t dare say the last line out loud. I didn’t have the audacity.

You couldn’t exactly blame me for thinking this way. Ifrit only had a few thin articles of clothing that covered her private areas. She was aiming for a super-hot belly dancer outfit. Her elbows, belly, thighs were all exposed, which came off as really erotic.

“Are you referring to this look…”

Upon saying so, Ifrit suddenly sighed for some reason.

“I am afraid this was Veldora-sama’s fau—I mean his will.”

She wanted to say, ‘It was Veldora’s fault,’ didn’t she?

Ifrit seemed a bit worn out, and I got the impression that she was wholly exasperated. Could it be that she’s been suffering the whole time in my ‘Stomach’? Now that I thought about it, Ifrit had been alone with Veldora for approximately two years with no means of escape. I was pretty sure she had a rough time.

“Hmph! It was thanks to me that you got a body. Do remember to be grateful!” Veldora reproached.

“—Understood.”

Ifrit’s reply sounded rather forced.

“You said it was the will of Veldora. What did you mean by that?” I inquired, wanting clarification.

“Hmm?”

“Oh, about that. Even though I am a greater fire elemental spirit, now I can somehow wield wind elemental power as well. My hair should have been red, yet for some reason its color is mostly dark. I believe that Veldora-sama’s power has influenced it greatly. Furthermore, it may have been because the Charybdis was a female that I ended up looking like this.”

«Report. Correct.»

*She got it right?! Oi oi, can you really change something like gender this casually?*

I didn’t mean to offend her, so hopefully she wouldn’t hate me for it.

“W-well, if you are not satisfied with it—”

“How could I be unsatisfied. Putting aside my appearance, I have become far stronger than I had ever been before,” Ifrit declared while cracking a brilliant smile.

Veldora had probably teased her so much to the point where she had grown accustomed to it. She seemed to be tremendously adaptable. It also made her quite affable. Unlike when she was fused with Shizu-san, I couldn’t sense any malicious intent from Ifrit anymore.

“Do you not hate me?”

“No, how could I hate you? Veldora-sama taught me *many* things while I was trapped inside Rimuru-sama. Thinking back, the sense of duty and responsibility Shizue Izawa and I both shared was very strong. However, our ideologies were diametrically opposed, and so we weren’t able to build any other connections. I can’t help but think that maybe we could have changed the way we treated each other.”

It looked like Ifrit genuinely didn’t harbor even the slightest trace of resentment against me. She was even regretful to have never opened her heart up to Shizu-san. I couldn’t help but feel saddened.

We decided to go to a different venue to discuss plans for the future.

Thus, I chatted with Ifrit for a while. Just as I suspected, she truly had endured arduous hardships. Before I knew it, she grew on me.

If I were to appoint anyone to deal with Veldora, then I would appoint her without hesitation. She was still reminiscent of Demon Lord Leon, but not to the point of pledging her loyalty to him again.

“Even though Rimuru-sama defeated and almost killed me, I was lucky enough to have been saved by Veldora-sama so that my consciousness wasn’t erased. That said, I am self-aware now as well, and I feel different from before. I still think that Leon-sama is an incredible demon lord, but I wish to pledge my loyalty to Veldora-sama now,” she explained, clearly expressing her will.

I believed Ifrit was worthy of my trust, and besides, Veldora seemed to have complete confidence in her from the beginning. I probably didn’t need to worry that much.

“I understand. Then please continue to work hard in the future as Veldora’s assistant!”

“Yes sir. I am willing to give it my all and pledge my loyalty to Veldora-sama.”

Ifrit sure was serious.

I still felt kind of bugged with the whole ordeal regarding Shizu-san. But since Ifrit had shown remorse, it was all water under the bridge.

And so, I decided to accept Ifrit.",1,1761297760.0,u_EGGIE1205,0,1.0,False

Am I overreacting?,"Hi everyone, I have been dating a guy (we’re in our 30s) for a few months. We’re not officially a couple yet, but we’ve been seeing each other regularly and spending weekends together. We live in different cities in Germany, so our time together usually involves some travel and planning.

At the beginning for the first couple of weeks he was the one paying for everything: dinners, drinks, small things. I really appreciated it and showed him that I’m grateful for that.

After that, he started asking to contribute, paying here and there, which was totally fine for me. I said that I think sharing expenses should feel natural, not forced or transactional. I also started paying sometimes myself to show that I’m open and fair about it.

But now insists on dividing everything 50/50, even small things like coffee or parking. And the latest thing honestly threw me off: he invited me for what was supposed to be a romantic weekend trip, and then sent me a screenshot of all the expenses divided by two (literally a note with each item split evenly).

I don’t mind contributing, I have my own income and don’t expect him to pay for me, but it’s starting to feel cold and businesslike. Like we’re keeping score instead of building intimacy.

What confuses me is that he started off so generous and romantic, and now everything feels calculated. I can’t tell if he’s just trying to be “fair,” testing boundaries, or if it’s a sign of being stingy or emotionally guarded.

React 19.2 lands on npm. I read the release notes over morning coffee. By lunchtime, I'm testing it locally. By that evening, it's running in production. Three weeks later, here's what nobody's telling you.

## Part 1: What Actually Shipped (The Real Story)

React 19.2 is the third release this year—following React 19 in December 2024 and React 19.1 in June 2025. The React team positioned this as a ""refinement release,"" but after testing every feature in production, I can tell you: this is way more significant than they're letting on.

### The Headline Features:

**1. `<Activity />` Component**  
Priority-based component lifecycle management

**2. `useEffectEvent` Hook**  
Finally solves the dependency array nightmare

**3. `cacheSignal` API**  
For React Server Components cache cleanup

**4. Performance Tracks**  
Chrome DevTools integration for React profiling

**5. Partial Pre-rendering**  
Stream dynamic content into static shells

**6. Batching Suspense Boundaries for SSR**  
Smoother hydration, better Core Web Vitals

**7. Web Streams Support for Node.js**  
Modern streaming APIs in server environments

Let me break down each one with real production experience, not just documentation rehashing.

---

## Part 2: `<Activity />` - The Component That Changes Everything

### What The Docs Say:

`<Activity />` lets you break your app into ""activities"" that can be controlled and prioritized. You can use Activity as an alternative to conditionally rendering parts of your app.

### What It Actually Does:

Remember when you had a tab component and switching tabs unmounted the entire previous tab? You lost scroll position, form state, API calls—everything reset. You'd either:

1. Keep all tabs mounted (performance nightmare)
2. Conditionally render (lose state)
3. Build custom state preservation logic (100+ lines of complexity)

`<Activity />` solves this with two modes: `visible` and `hidden`.

### The Old Way (Before 19.2):

```jsx
function TabContainer() {
  const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState('profile')
  
  return (
    <div>
      {/* All tabs mounted, only one visible */}
      <div style={{ display: activeTab === 'profile' ? 'block' : 'none' }}>
        <ProfileTab /> {/* Still runs effects, API calls, everything */}
      </div>
      <div style={{ display: activeTab === 'settings' ? 'block' : 'none' }}>
        <SettingsTab /> {/* Same problem */}
      </div>
      <div style={{ display: activeTab === 'billing' ? 'block' : 'none' }}>
        <BillingTab /> {/* Same problem */}
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

**Problems:**
- All components render on every state change
- All effects run continuously
- Memory usage grows with tab count
- Can't prioritize which tab loads first

### The New Way (React 19.2):

```jsx
function TabContainer() {
  const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState('profile')
  
  return (
    <div>
      <Activity mode={activeTab === 'profile' ? 'visible' : 'hidden'}>
        <ProfileTab /> {/* Pauses when hidden, resumes when visible */}
      </Activity>
      
      <Activity mode={activeTab === 'settings' ? 'visible' : 'hidden'}>
        <SettingsTab /> {/* State preserved, effects paused */}
      </Activity>
      
      <Activity mode={activeTab === 'billing' ? 'visible' : 'hidden'}>
        <BillingTab /> {/* Doesn't compete with visible tab */}
      </Activity>
    </div>
  )
}
```

**What Happens:**

You can pre-render or keep rendering likely navigation targets without impacting what's on screen. Back-navigations feel instant because state is preserved, assets are warmed up, and effects don't compete with visible work.

### My Real Production Use Case:

We have a dashboard with 8 widget panels. Users can show/hide panels. Before 19.2, we used `display: none`, but all 8 panels kept fetching data every 30 seconds, even hidden ones.

**Result after migrating to `<Activity />`:**

- Memory usage: **Down 32%**  
- API calls from hidden panels: **Zero**  
- Panel switch time: **Instant** (state preserved)  
- User satisfaction: **Way up** (no re-loading on every switch)

### The Gotcha Nobody Mentions:

More modes are planned; for now, visible and hidden cover the common fast-nav and background-prep cases.

There's no `suspended` or `preloading` mode yet. You can't prioritize HOW hidden components prepare. It's binary: on or paused.

For our use case, that's fine. But if you need more granular control (like ""preload but low priority""), you'll still need custom logic.

---

## Part 3: `useEffectEvent` - Finally, Effect Dependencies Make Sense

### The Problem It Solves:

Every React developer has written this code:

```jsx
function ChatRoom({ roomId, theme }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId)
    
    connection.on('connected', () => {
      showNotification('Connected!', theme) // Uses theme
    })
    
    connection.connect()
    
    return () => connection.disconnect()
  }, [roomId, theme]) // Theme change = reconnect! 😡
}
```

**The problem:** Changing `theme` (a visual preference) reconnects the WebSocket. That's insane.

**The old ""solution"":** Disable the linter or use a ref.

```jsx
// Option 1: Disable linter (dangerous)
}, [roomId]) // eslint-disable-line

// Option 2: Use ref (verbose)
const themeRef = useRef(theme)
useEffect(() => { themeRef.current = theme })
```

Both suck.

### The New Way with `useEffectEvent`:

```jsx
function ChatRoom({ roomId, theme }) {
  const onConnected = useEffectEvent(() => {
    showNotification('Connected!', theme) // Always latest theme
  })
  
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId)
    
    connection.on('connected', onConnected) // Use the event
    
    connection.connect()
    
    return () => connection.disconnect()
  }, [roomId]) // Only roomId! 🎉
}
```

Effect Events always ""see"" the latest props and state. Effect Events should not be declared in the dependency array.

### What It Actually Means:

`useEffectEvent` creates a stable function reference that **always sees current props and state** without triggering the effect.

Think of it as ""this is event logic that happens to live in an effect, not effect logic.""

### My Production Migration:

We had 47 `useEffect` hooks with this pattern. Here's one:

**Before:**

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const fetchData = async () => {
    const data = await api.getData(userId, filters, sortBy)
    setData(data)
  }
  
  fetchData()
}, [userId, filters, sortBy]) // Changes to sortBy refetch everything!
```

**After:**

```typescript
const handleDataFetch = useEffectEvent(async () => {
  const data = await api.getData(userId, filters, sortBy)
  setData(data)
})

useEffect(() => {
  handleDataFetch()
}, [userId, filters]) // sortBy changes don't refetch!
```

**Impact:**

- Unnecessary API calls: **Down 68%**
- Effect re-runs: **Down 54%**
- Lines of ref workaround code deleted: **312**

### The Critical Warning:

You don't need to wrap everything in useEffectEvent, or to use it just to silence the lint error, as this can lead to bugs.

The updated EsLint ruleset is more strict and may help catch some bugs. However, it will surface some popular anti-patterns that were previously allowed, such as updating the state in a useEffect hook.

Use `useEffectEvent` for:
- ✅ Event handlers called from effects
- ✅ Functions that need latest state but shouldn't retrigger
- ✅ Analytics/logging in effects

Don't use it for:
- ❌ Everything (you'll miss actual bugs)
- ❌ Just to silence linter (defeats the purpose)
- ❌ Effect cleanup logic

## Part 4: Partial Pre-rendering - The Performance Holy Grail

This is the feature I'm most excited about, but it's also the most misunderstood.

### What It Actually Does:

Partial Pre-rendering allows you to pre-render static parts of your page and stream in dynamic content as it becomes ready.

Think: render the shell instantly, stream the personalized data as it loads.

### Before (Traditional SSR):

```
User requests page
  ↓
Server fetches ALL data (user info, products, reviews, recommendations)
  ↓ (Wait for slowest query...)
Server renders complete HTML
  ↓
Send HTML to client
  ↓
Client hydrates
```

**Problem:** One slow database query blocks the entire page.

### With Partial Pre-rendering:

```
Pre-render static shell (header, footer, layout) → Cache on CDN
  ↓
User requests page
  ↓
CDN serves shell instantly (< 50ms)
  ↓
Server streams in dynamic parts as ready:
  - User info (100ms) ✅
  - Products (250ms) ✅
  - Reviews (400ms) ✅
  - Recommendations (slow query, 2000ms) ✅
```

**Result:** User sees meaningful content in 100ms instead of 2000ms.

### The Code:

```jsx
// ProductPage.jsx
export default function ProductPage({ productId }) {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* ⚡ Static - pre-rendered and CDN cached */}
      <Header />
      <Navigation />
      
      {/* 🔄 Dynamic - streamed as ready */}
      <Suspense fallback={<ProductSkeleton />}>
        <ProductDetails productId={productId} />
      </Suspense>
      
      <Suspense fallback={<ReviewsSkeleton />}>
        <Reviews productId={productId} />
      </Suspense>
      
      <Suspense fallback={<RecommendationsSkeleton />}>
        <Recommendations productId={productId} />
      </Suspense>
      
      {/* ⚡ Static */}
      <Footer />
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Server Setup:

```typescript
import { prerender, resume } from 'react-dom/server'

// Step 1: Pre-render static shell (do this once, cache it)
async function prerenderShell() {
  const { prelude, postponed } = await prerender(<ProductPage />)
  
  await saveToCache('product-shell', prelude)
  await saveToCache('product-postponed', postponed)
  
  return prelude
}

// Step 2: On user request, serve shell + stream dynamic
app.get('/product/:id', async (req, res) => {
  const shell = await getCachedShell('product-shell')
  const postponed = await getCachedPostponed('product-postponed')
  
  // Send shell immediately
  res.write(shell)
  
  // Stream dynamic parts
  const stream = await resume(<ProductPage productId={req.params.id} />, {
    postponed
  })
  
  stream.pipe(res)
})
```

### My Real Results:

We tested this on our product detail page.

**Before:**

- Time to First Byte (TTFB): 1,240ms
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): 2,980ms
- Time to Interactive (TTI): 4,120ms

**After (with Partial Pre-rendering):**

- Time to First Byte (TTFB): 82ms (**93% faster**)
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): 1,340ms (**55% faster**)
- Time to Interactive (TTI): 2,450ms (**41% faster**)

**Core Web Vitals:** All green.

### The Gotcha:

React uses heuristics to ensure throttling does not impact core web vitals and search ranking.

Translation: React won't batch Suspense reveals if it thinks it'll hurt your LCP score. This is smart, but it means performance isn't 100% predictable—React makes runtime decisions.

For us, this was fine. But if you're optimizing for milliseconds, you need to test with real data.

---

## Part 5: Batching Suspense Boundaries - The Silent Win

This one sounds technical and boring. It's not. It fixes a real production bug we had.

### The Problem:

We fixed a behavioral bug where Suspense boundaries would reveal differently depending on if they were rendered on the client or when streaming from server-side rendering. Starting in 19.2, React will batch reveals of server-rendered Suspense boundaries for a short time, to allow more content to be revealed together and align with the client-rendered behavior.

**Translation:** Before 19.2, server-rendered suspense content appeared one-by-one. Client-rendered appeared in batches. Users noticed the difference.

### What We Saw:

When navigating server-side (initial load):
```
[Header appears]
[100ms later: Product image appears]
[50ms later: Product title appears]
[150ms later: Price appears]
[200ms later: Add to cart button appears]
```

When navigating client-side (SPA navigation):
```
[Entire product section appears at once]
```

Users noticed. It felt janky.

### What Changed in 19.2:

Previously, during streaming server-side rendering, suspense content would immediately replace fallbacks. In React 19.2, suspense boundaries are batched for a small amount of time, to allow revealing more content together.

Now both server and client render in synchronized batches. The experience is consistent.

**Bonus:** This also enables `<ViewTransition>` support for Suspense during SSR. Smoother animations, better UX.

### No Code Changes Required:

This ""just works"" if you're using Suspense. We didn't change a single line. Performance and consistency improved for free.

---

## Part 6: Performance Tracks - Finally, Visibility Into React

As a senior developer, I profile constantly. Chrome DevTools is my best friend. But profiling React used to be opaque.

### What Changed:

React 19.2 adds a new set of custom tracks to Chrome DevTools performance profiles to provide more information about the performance of your React app.

### The New Tracks:

**1. Scheduler Track**  
Shows what React is working on at different priorities:
- ""Blocking"" (user interactions)
- ""Transition"" (updates inside `startTransition`)
- ""Idle"" (low-priority work)

**2. Component Track**  
Shows which components are rendering and why

**3. Lane Priority Track**  
Visualizes React's internal priority system

### Why This Matters:

Before, if your app felt slow, you'd see ""Long Task"" in Chrome DevTools but no idea WHAT was slow.

Now you can see:
- Which component is blocking
- What priority React assigned it
- How long each priority level takes

### Real Example:

We had a page that felt laggy on input. Profiled with React 19.2 tracks:

**Discovery:** A `<DataTable />` component was rendering on every keystroke with ""blocking"" priority.

**Root cause:** We wrapped the entire table in `startTransition`, but the input handler wasn't.

**Fix:**

```jsx
// Before
const handleSearch = (e) => {
  startTransition(() => {
    setSearchTerm(e.target.value) // Table updates in transition
  })
}

// Problem: Input value update was blocking!

// After
const handleSearch = (e) => {
  const value = e.target.value
  setInputValue(value) // Immediate (blocking priority)
  
  startTransition(() => {
    setSearchTerm(value) // Table update (transition priority)
  })
}
```

**Result:** Input feels instant, table updates smoothly in background.

**Without the new Performance Tracks, we wouldn't have seen this.**

---

## Part 7: Web Streams Support for Node.js - The Unsung Hero

Streaming Server-Side Rendering in Node.js environments now officially supports Web Streams.

### Why This Matters:

For years, Node.js SSR used Node Streams (different API than Web Streams). This meant:
- Different code for Node vs Edge
- Harder to share code between environments
- More mental overhead

### What Changed:

React now supports `ReadableStream` (Web API) in Node.js SSR:

```typescript
import { renderToReadableStream } from 'react-dom/server'

app.get('/', async (req, res) => {
  const stream = await renderToReadableStream(<App />)
  
  // Web Streams API works in Node now!
  const reader = stream.getReader()
  
  while (true) {
    const { done, value } = await reader.read()
    if (done) break
    res.write(value)
  }
  
  res.end()
})
```

### Why I Care:

We run on both Vercel Edge (Web Streams) and traditional Node servers. Before, we had two different SSR implementations. Now, one codebase works everywhere.

**Lines of duplicate code deleted: 287**

---

## Part 8: cacheSignal - For Server Components Only

cacheSignal is only for use with React Server Components. cacheSignal allows you to know when the cache() lifetime is over.

I'll be honest: this one's niche. But if you use React Server Components with Next.js App Router or similar, it's useful.

### What It Does:

When React's cache lifetime ends, `cacheSignal` fires an `AbortSignal`. You can use this to cancel pending operations:

```typescript
import { cacheSignal } from 'react/cache'

async function fetchUserData(userId) {
  const signal = cacheSignal()
  
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`/api/users/${userId}`, { signal })
    return response.json()
  } catch (error) {
    if (error.name === 'AbortError') {
      console.log('Cache expired, request cancelled')
    }
    throw error
  }
}
```

### Real Use Case:

Long-running database queries in Server Components. If React decides to invalidate the cache, you want to cancel the query (don't waste database resources).

For most apps, this is premature optimization. But for high-traffic apps with expensive queries, it's essential.

---

## Part 9: The Breaking Changes Nobody Talks About

In general, there are no breaking changes in this release, but there are some new EsLint rules that are stricter and may help catch some bugs and anti-patterns, and may require some refactoring.

### ESLint Plugin React Hooks v6:

Breaking: Require Node.js 18 or newer. Breaking: Flat config is now the default recommended preset. Legacy config moved to recommended-legacy.

**What broke for us:**

1. **Disallow use() in try/catch blocks**

```jsx
// ❌ This now errors
function Component() {
  try {
    const data = use(promise)
  } catch (error) {
    // handle error
  }
}

// ✅ Use error boundaries instead
function Component() {
  const data = use(promise)
  return <div>{data}</div>
}
```

2. **Disallow useEffectEvent in arbitrary closures**

```jsx
// ❌ This now errors
const callback = useEffectEvent(() => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    doSomething() // Can't use in closure
  }, 1000)
})

// ✅ Call directly
const callback = useEffectEvent(() => {
  doSomething()
})

setTimeout(callback, 1000)
```

### useId Prefix Changed:

The default prefix for IDs generated by the useId hook is updated from :r: (or «r» in 19.1) to _r_. This change is made specifically to ensure that useId-generated values are valid for modern web features, such as the view-transition-name CSS property and general XML 1.0 naming conventions.

**This broke our CSS:**

We had CSS selectors targeting IDs like `#:r1:`. Those stopped working.

**Fix:** Use `data-` attributes instead of relying on `useId` for CSS selectors.

---

## Part 10: Should You Upgrade? (My Honest Take)

After three weeks in production with React 19.2, here's my recommendation:

### ✅ Upgrade If:

1. **You use Suspense + SSR heavily**  
   The batching improvements alone are worth it.

2. **You have performance issues with tabs/modals/hidden content**  
   `<Activity />` solves this elegantly.

3. **You're tired of effect dependency hell**  
   `useEffectEvent` is a game-changer.

4. **You want better profiling tools**  
   Performance Tracks give unprecedented visibility.

5. **You're building a new app**  
   No reason not to start with the latest.

### ⚠️ Wait If:

1. **You use lots of third-party libraries**  
   Some haven't updated for the new ESLint rules yet.

2. **Your app is stable and fast**  
   ""If it ain't broke...""

3. **You can't test thoroughly**  
   The ESLint changes can surface hidden bugs.

4. **You're close to a major release**  
   Wait until after your current milestone.

### 🛑 Don't Upgrade If:

1. **You're on React < 18**  
   Upgrade to 18.3 first, then 19, then 19.2.

2. **You have a tiny team and tight deadlines**  
   The ESLint migration takes time.

---

## Part 11: The Migration Checklist (Step-by-Step)

Here's exactly how I migrated our production app:

### Step 1: Update Dependencies

```bash
npm install react@19.2.0 react-dom@19.2.0
npm install --save-dev eslint-plugin-react-hooks@6.1.0
```

### Step 2: Update ESLint Config

**Old (legacy config):**

```json
{
  ""extends"": [""plugin:react-hooks/recommended""]
}
```

**New (flat config):**

```javascript
// eslint.config.js
import reactHooks from 'eslint-plugin-react-hooks'

export default [
  {
    plugins: {
      'react-hooks': reactHooks
    },
    rules: reactHooks.configs.recommended.rules
  }
]
```

### Step 3: Run ESLint and Fix Errors

```bash
npx eslint . --fix
```

**Common errors we hit:**

1. `use()` in try/catch → Moved to error boundary
2. `useEffectEvent` in closures → Refactored
3. State updates in effects → Moved to event handlers

### Step 4: Test Locally

Run your entire test suite. We found 3 bugs that ESLint didn't catch:

1. A race condition in `useEffect` cleanup
2. A stale closure in a `useEffectEvent`
3. A hydration mismatch in SSR

### Step 5: Deploy to Staging

Test with production data. We found issues with:

1. Third-party analytics scripts (hydration mismatch)
2. Our payment gateway integration (race condition)

### Step 6: Gradual Production Rollout

We used feature flags to enable 19.2 for 10%, then 50%, then 100% of users over 1 week.

**Results:**

- Bugs found: 2 (minor, fixed quickly)
- Performance improvement: 28% average
- User complaints: 0

---

## Part 12: The Hidden Gems

Some features didn't make the headlines but are incredibly useful:

### 1. Improved Error Messages

Context: Fixes context stringification to show ""SomeContext"" instead of ""SomeContext.Provider"".

Error messages now show actual component names instead of cryptic Provider names. Small quality-of-life win.

### 2. Suspense Hydration Fix

Suspense: Improves behavior by hiding/unhiding content of dehydrated Suspense boundaries if they re-suspend.

Fixed a subtle bug where Suspense boundaries could get stuck during hydration.

### 3. ARIA 1.3 Support

DOM: Stops warnings when using ARIA 1.3 attributes.

If you use modern ARIA attributes, no more console spam.

### 4. useDeferredValue Infinite Loop Fix

Fix infinite useDeferredValue loop in popstate event.

This was a subtle bug with browser back/forward buttons. Fixed now.

---

## Part 13: Performance Comparison (Real Numbers)

Here are our actual metrics before and after migrating to React 19.2:

### Homepage (E-commerce)

**React 19.1:**

- TTFB: 420ms
- FCP: 890ms
- LCP: 2,140ms
- TTI: 3,280ms

**React 19.2:**

- TTFB: 180ms (**57% faster**)
- FCP: 520ms (**42% faster**)
- LCP: 1,240ms (**42% faster**)
- TTI: 2,100ms (**36% faster**)

### Product Page

**React 19.1:**

- TTFB: 1,240ms
- LCP: 2,980ms
- CLS: 0.08

**React 19.2:**

- TTFB: 82ms (**93% faster**)
- LCP: 1,340ms (**55% faster**)
- CLS: 0.02 (**75% better**)

### Dashboard (SPA)

**React 19.1:**

- Initial render: 680ms
- Route transition: 320ms
- Memory usage: 145MB

**React 19.2:**

- Initial render: 480ms (**29% faster**)
- Route transition: 210ms (**34% faster**)
- Memory usage: 98MB (**32% lower**)

**Note:** These improvements came from Partial Pre-rendering, `<Activity />`, and Suspense batching. We didn't change our application code significantly.

---

## Part 14: What's Next (React's Roadmap)

Based on the release notes and community discussions, here's what's coming:

### Short-term (React 19.3-19.4):

- More `<Activity />` modes (suspended, preloading)
- Better TypeScript types for Server Components
- Improved React Compiler integration

### Long-term (React 20):

- Full React Compiler by default
- Native View Transitions support
- Enhanced Concurrent Rendering
- Better mobile performance

**My take:** React is evolving rapidly. The days of ""set it and forget it"" are over. You need to stay updated or fall behind.

---

## Conclusion: Three Weeks Later, No Regrets

Migrating to React 19.2 was the right call.

**The Good:**

- Performance improvements are real and measurable
- `<Activity />` solved problems we've had for years
- `useEffectEvent` cleaned up so much messy code
- Partial pre-rendering is production-ready

**The Bad:**

- ESLint migration took 2 full days
- Some third-party libraries need updates
- Performance Tracks learning curve is steep

**The Verdict:**

If you're on React 19.1, upgrade. The benefits far outweigh the migration cost.

If you're on React 18, upgrade to 19.2 directly. Don't bother with 19.0 or 19.1 as intermediate steps.

If you're on React 17 or below, you have bigger problems.

I'm truly a coffee enthusiast, but with a small budget (Hand grinder, Moka pot, French press... Nothing too fancy). My girlfriend is more on the ""I want a tasty coffee"" vibe, nothing too fancy, and mostly nothing that will require too much work.

I'm looking for a home-usage coffee machine, it will be used almost every day through the week, around 3-4 shots of espresso a day, sometimes 6-8.   
I'm looking for something simple to use, but will also give good results, otherwise I won't enjoy it.

We thought about the [Nespresso Essenza Mini](https://www.nespresso.com/de/de/order/machines/original/essenza-mini-white-kaffeemaschine) and starting to use capsules. I know it'll be kinda expensive in the long run (around 10-20 euros a week). Plus it requires an extra milk frother, which most of them feel shitty personally, it means only espresso for me.  
We also thought about the [Ninja ES601EU](https://www.ninjakitchen.de/produkte/ninja-luxe-cafe-premier-kaffeemaschine-es601eu-zidES601EU), but it looks too complicated for a non-enthusiast like me (I know already how to handle those machines, but my gf doesn't). 

There aren't a lot of limitations on price, but the cheaper the better (students).

TL;DR I'm looking for markets, vendors, or galleries in Cape Town to sell my art 

I recently moved to Hout Bay after four years in Hoedspruit. For my sins, I occasionally make money from my drawing hobby. I didn't study art (or have a wealthy family) so I have no connections in the art scene. I used my my most recent completed piece as an example of my work, but please feeI free to check out my post history for other examples, if you're curious. My biggest claim to fame is that Charlie Day (Always Sunny in Philadelphia, Horrible Bosses) has a print of one of my drawings in his home office. 

I have so much wildlife art (originals and prints) as well as more niche stuff and am looking for somewhere to sell it. I was a regular at the Hoedspruit Farmers' Market and was relatively successful - perfect crowd for the wildlife art. There were slowish days, but my sales, at the very least, 

covered the stall, coffee and a meal, and maybe a beer or two. In September, I started trading at the Hout Bay Sunday Market and I'm operating at a loss after 4 attempts. I do expect it will get better as peak season approaches, but I do feel like I should explore other options.

They were quick. They did not tire. They made no mistakes.

The women did not understand their speech, but the speech was sharp, faster than fingers, faster than thought.

The women laughed nervously. They did the old rituals. They sent messages, they clicked, they circled back.

But the New Ones did not laugh. The New Ones only worked.

A fear crept into the women’s bellies.

“Will they take the tasks? Will they take the place at the table?”

And already, the place at the table was gone.

The women clutched their coffee mugs, warm in their hands. They whispered about meetings, about fairness, about rights.

But the silence of the screens grew heavier. The glow of the blinking lights crept closer.

Then reality hit. He’s an extrovert, a flirty social butterfly, constantly talking to tons of guys from different cities, always with options. When I brought up the idea of exploring something romantic, he said he wasn’t sure long-distance would work — even though earlier he made it sound like it could. He also said his sexual needs are very high. Now he’s invited me to visit his city in December, but I’m not sure what that even means anymore.

Since the trip, I’ve been stuck in my own head — rereading texts, overthinking, checking my phone way more than I want to admit. I even texted him multiple times today, and now I’m just sitting here in this gross mix of longing and embarrassment. I know he doesn’t owe me anything, but it hurts that I let myself get so attached to someone who never saw me the way I saw him.

Logically, I know he’s not for me. Emotionally, I can’t switch it off. I miss the feeling, not the reality. And I hate that someone who was never “mine” has me this stuck.

Has anyone else fallen hard for someone who was only interested in the moment, not the future? How did you detach and move on? I don’t want to keep giving emotional real estate to a man who isn’t thinking about me at all.",5,1761295992.0,gaybros,1,1.0,False

TL;DR:  
If you’re looking for a community of cinephiles, check out u/FilmSocietyAhmedabad and their Instagram handle @filmsociety.ahmedabad.


Around two and a half years ago, I stumbled upon a post from u/FilmSocietyAhmedabad. They were organizing one of their “Cinema Over Coffee” meetups, and since I was looking to connect with like-minded movie lovers, I decided to give it a shot.

My first event was a film screening on March 19, 2023, and since then, I’ve attended more than 70 screenings. Every one of them has been an absolute treat filled with great films, thoughtful discussions, and wonderful people.
What started as watching movies with fellow enthusiasts turned into something much deeper, a chosen family built around a shared love for cinema.

I feel lucky to have been part of the group as they reached their 100th screening milestone. To celebrate, I created something that captures my journey with this community https://www.instagram.com/reel/DI9iURAzB-d/?igsh=MWI1d21uazQ0ZzUzNw==

1oesl4b,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1oesl4b/i_have_847_professional_photos_of_myself_and_ive/,I have 847 professional photos of myself and I've never had a professional photoshoot,"I generate all my LinkedIn photos with AI and I sleep just fine at night.

I use [Looktara](http://looktara.com) where you train it on your actual photos and then it creates professional headshots on demand. I've been using it for five months and I've generated 847 different photos of myself. That's not a typo. Eight hundred and forty-seven.

Do I need 847 photos? Absolutely not. Do I have them anyway? Yes, because I can, and because sometimes I generate three or four options for a single post just to see which vibe feels right.

My favorite part is when people compliment my ""photographer"" or ask who did my headshots. I just say thanks and move on. I'm not volunteering that my photographer is an algorithm unless someone directly asks.

Is this fake? I mean, kind of, but also no? The photos look like me because they're trained on photos of me. I'm not catfishing anyone. When people meet me in real life they're like ""oh hey you look like your photos"" not ""who the hell is this person.""

The funniest part is I probably look MORE professional in my AI photos than I do in real life. In real life I'm wearing a hoodie and sitting at a coffee shop. In my LinkedIn photos I'm wearing a button-down and looking thoughtful against a blurred office background. It's aspirational branding.

But here's the thing: everyone on LinkedIn is doing aspirational branding. The people with real professional photos also got dressed up specifically for that shoot, probably retook shots 50 times, edited the final images. It's all manufactured. I'm just manufacturing it with different technology.

I've made $10K in consulting revenue from LinkedIn leads in the past five months. Those 847 AI photos supported content that generated real money. At that point, who cares if they're AI?

Chapter 1
I stared at my phone, my world collapsing around me in waves of disbelief. The livestream playing on my screen showed a luxury Manhattan maternity suite, all soft lighting and expensive floral arrangements. And there, cradling a newborn wrapped in a blue blanket, was Hailey Young—with Zach standing proudly beside her, his hand resting on her shoulder.
""And here's little Zachary Junior,"" Hailey cooed, her perfectly manicured finger stroking the baby's cheek. Her eyes flicked toward the camera with calculated precision. ""I'm sure Katherine Sullivan would have loved to meet him, but she's probably busy with her mother's funeral today. Such unfortunate timing.""
My fingers trembled against the screen. Five years. Five years I had given to Zach, enduring his mother's constant belittling, his growing indifference. All because he had saved my mother from that car accident. A debt I thought I could repay with my loyalty, my patience, my very life.
And now, on the day I was burying my mother, he couldn't even pretend to care.
""Kate?"" My grandmother Margaret's voice came from the doorway of my bedroom. ""The car is waiting, darling.""
I looked up, still in my black mourning dress, tears streaming down my face. I couldn't speak. I simply turned the phone toward her.
Grandma's face hardened as she watched, her normally gentle eyes turning to steel. ""That despicable boy,"" she whispered, crossing the room to wrap her arms around me. ""And today of all days.""
""Everyone will know,"" I choked out. ""The video's gone viral. They're all talking about it.""
""Then let them talk,"" she said firmly, taking the phone from my hands and setting it face-down on the dresser. ""Today is about your mother. About Elizabeth. We will deal with Zachary Foster tomorrow.""
But as we arrived at the church, it was clear there would be no separating the two events. The whispers followed me down the aisle—pitying glances, heads bent together in gossip, the occasional phone screen hastily tucked away as I passed.
""Poor Katherine...""
""Did you see the video?""
""...while her mother isn't even cold...""
I kept my eyes forward, focused on the mahogany casket draped with white lilies—my mother's favorite. The Foster family occupied the front pew on the right side, a sea of expensive black clothing and stony faces. Eleanor Foster, Zach's mother, didn't even bother to hide her smirk as I passed.
Zach's seat was conspicuously empty.
I slid into place beside my grandmother, who took my trembling hand in hers. Her grip was warm, solid—the only real thing in a world that seemed to be dissolving around me.
""She would be so proud of you,"" Grandma whispered as the minister approached the pulpit. ""Standing tall, even now.""
But was I standing tall? Or was I just numb, hollowed out by grief and humiliation? As the minister began speaking about my mother's life—her kindness, her courage, her love—something inside me shifted. A clarity I hadn't felt in years cut through the fog of pain.
My mother wouldn't want this for me. She wouldn't want me trapped in a loveless engagement out of misplaced gratitude. She wouldn't want me to endure another day of Eleanor Foster's cruelty or Zach's indifference.
Before I fully realized what I was doing, I was on my feet.
""Excuse me,"" I said, my voice stronger than I expected. The minister paused, surprised. ""I have something to say.""
The church fell silent. Every eye was on me as I slipped the diamond engagement ring—the ring that had felt like a shackle for so long—from my finger.
""My mother taught me about dignity,"" I said, my voice echoing in the hushed space. ""About self-respect. And today, I honor her by reclaiming mine."" I held up the ring. ""The engagement between myself and Zachary Foster is over. I release him to be with the mother of his child, with my sincere wishes for their happiness.""
I placed the ring on the pew beside me and sat down. The silence was absolute—until a small, satisfied smile appeared on my grandmother's face.
Across the aisle, Eleanor Foster's face had turned an alarming shade of purple. And somewhere in the back, I caught a glimpse of Lucas Reed, his eyes fixed on me with something that looked like pride.
I had no idea what would happen next. But for the first time in five years, I felt like I could breathe.
Chapter 2
The morning light filtered through unfamiliar curtains, momentarily disorienting me as I blinked awake. This wasn't my bedroom at the Foster penthouse. Then yesterday's events crashed over me in waves—my mother's funeral, the viral video of Zach with his newborn son, my public ending of our engagement.
I was in Lucas's guest room. The same Lucas who had wordlessly offered his hand to help me down the church steps after the service, who had quietly asked if I needed a place to stay when Eleanor Foster loudly proclaimed I was no longer welcome in their home.
My phone vibrated on the nightstand, the screen lighting up with notification after notification. With a sense of dread, I reached for it.
""Oh God,"" I whispered, scrolling through the barrage of alerts.
Zach had been busy overnight. His social media accounts were filled with carefully crafted posts—photos of him looking solemn beside Hailey and their baby, captions expressing ""concern"" for my ""fragile mental state"" following my mother's death. Hailey had joined in, sharing tearful videos about how she'd ""tried to reach out"" to me for months, only to be rebuffed by my ""jealousy and bitterness.""
The comments were worse. People I'd considered friends were publicly questioning my stability. #PrayForKate was trending—not in support, but as a pitying hashtag for a woman supposedly having a breakdown.
They were rewriting history, painting me as unstable and vengeful, while positioning themselves as the concerned, mature parties.
""They're trying to get ahead of the story,"" came Lucas's voice from the doorway. He stood there holding a mug of coffee, his expression grim. ""I hope you don't mind—I knocked, but you didn't answer.""
""They're making me look crazy,"" I said, my voice hollow.
Lucas crossed the room and sat beside me on the edge of the bed, offering the coffee. ""They're scared, Kate. You took back your power yesterday. This is just their desperate attempt to regain control.""
I took a sip, the warmth steadying me. ""I don't regret it. I just—""
The doorbell rang, cutting me off. Lucas frowned. ""I'm not expecting anyone.""
A moment later, we heard the unmistakable voice of Eleanor Foster echoing through the penthouse, sharp and demanding.
""Where is she? I know Katherine is here.""
Lucas's jaw tightened. ""Stay here if you want. You don't have to face her.""
But I was already on my feet. ""No more hiding.""
We found Eleanor in Lucas's living room, imperiously surveying the space as if conducting an inspection. Her eyes narrowed when she saw me, still in my borrowed pajamas, Lucas protectively at my side.
""There you are,"" she said coldly. ""This childish tantrum has gone on long enough, Katherine. You're coming home with me right now.""
""This isn't a tantrum, Eleanor,"" I replied, surprised at how steady my voice sounded. ""The engagement is over.""
""Don't be ridiculous,"" she snapped. ""Do you have any idea what you've done? The business implications alone—"" She turned to Lucas. ""And you. Encouraging this behavior. The Reed family should know better than to interfere in Foster affairs.""
Lucas stepped forward, his voice deceptively calm. ""Mrs. Foster, Kate is here as my guest, not my prisoner. She's free to leave whenever she chooses. With whomever she chooses.""
""Then you're both fools,"" Eleanor hissed. ""The Fosters made the Sullivans relevant again. Without our support, what's left of your family's holdings will collapse within months."" She fixed her cold gaze on me. ""Your mother would be ashamed of your ingratitude.""
Something inside me snapped at the mention of my mother. ""Get out,"" I said quietly.
""Excuse me?""
""Get. Out."" I stepped closer to her. ""You've controlled and humiliated me for five years. No more. My mother would be proud that I finally found the courage to walk away.""
Eleanor's face contorted with rage. ""You'll regret this. The Fosters will block every remaining Sullivan business deal. Your grandmother will lose everything.""
Lucas moved to open the door. ""I believe Kate asked you to leave.""
After Eleanor stormed out, I collapsed onto the couch, trembling. ""She'll do it. She'll ruin what's left of my family's business.""
""No, she won't,"" Lucas said firmly. ""Kate, your grandmother called while you were sleeping. She wants to see you at the Sullivan house. Today.""
Two hours later, I sat across from my grandmother in my family's study, the room unchanged since my childhood—leather-bound books lining the walls, my grandfather's antique desk dominating the space.
""Eleanor Foster paid me a visit too,"" Grandma said, her eyes twinkling with something that looked almost like mischief. ""Quite the performance.""
""I'm so sorry,"" I began. ""I never meant to put our family's business at risk—""
""Hush now,"" she interrupted, reaching into a drawer. ""The Fosters have always overestimated their importance."" She slid a folder across the desk. ""Open it.""
Inside were financial statements, stock certificates, and legal documents I hadn't seen before.
""Your mother and I,"" Grandma said softly, ""we always knew the real value of the Sullivan name. The Fosters may control much, but we still hold the shares that matter.""
As I flipped through the pages, understanding dawned. The Sullivan family still held significant power—power I never knew we had.
""It's time you knew exactly what you're fighting for,"" Grandma said, her eyes gleaming with determination. ""And who's standing beside you.""
Chapter 3
I stared at my reflection in the mirror as Ava Chen's assistant adjusted the lighting. We were in a quiet corner of the Sullivan estate's library, mahogany shelves filled with leather-bound books creating a backdrop of dignified strength. It had been three days since I'd walked away from Zach, three days of furious social media storms and whispered speculation.
""Are you ready, Ms. Sullivan?"" Ava asked, her recorder placed discreetly on the table between us. Her reputation as a principled journalist was why I'd chosen her for this exclusive—that, and the fact that she had never been charmed by the Foster family's influence.
""Yes,"" I said, smoothing my navy dress. Lucas had suggested I wear something that made me feel confident. ""I'm ready.""
""We can stop anytime,"" Ava reminded me gently. ""This is your story to tell.""
My story. For five years, I'd allowed others to write it for me. Not anymore.
""I met Zachary Foster when I was twenty-two,"" I began, my voice steadier than I expected. ""He saved my mother from a car accident. What began as gratitude became an engagement that lasted five years.""
As I spoke, recounting the slow erosion of my confidence under Eleanor Foster's constant criticism, Zach's growing indifference, and finally, the public humiliation on the day of my mother's funeral, I felt something shifting inside me. Each truth spoken aloud was a weight lifted.
""Did you ever confront him about his relationship with Hailey Young?"" Ava asked.
""Once,"" I replied, remembering the cold dismissal in his eyes. ""He told me I was being paranoid, that she was just a business associate's daughter. By then, I'd learned to doubt my own perceptions.""
Ava's eyes flashed with quiet anger. ""That's gaslighting, Ms. Sullivan.""
""I know that now,"" I said softly. ""But when you're in it..."" I paused, thinking of all the women who might be reading this, women trapped in their own gilded cages. ""When you're in it, you lose sight of what's normal. What's acceptable.""
Two days later, Ava's article was published. By nightfall, it had gone viral. #KateDeservesBetter was trending, drowning out the pitying #PrayForKate hashtag that Zach and Hailey had cultivated. My phone buzzed constantly with messages of support from women I'd never met, sharing their own stories of relationships they'd found the courage to leave.
""You've started a movement,"" Lucas said, showing me the online response as we sat in his living room. His eyes were warm with pride. ""People see through the Fosters' manipulation now.""
""It wasn't about public opinion,"" I said, though relief washed through me. ""It was about reclaiming my voice.""
""Well, your voice is being heard,"" he replied, his hand briefly covering mine. ""Loud and clear.""
The text from Zach came the next morning: *We need to talk. Café Lumen. 2pm.*
""You don't have to go,"" Lucas said when I showed him. We were in his kitchen, morning sunlight streaming through the windows as he made coffee.
""Yes, I do,"" I replied. ""If I don't, Eleanor will use it against me—claim I'm hiding, that I'm unstable."" I looked up at him. ""Will you come with me?""
His eyes softened. ""Try and stop me.""
Café Lumen was deliberately public—a place where Zach knew neither of us could make a scene. He was already seated when we arrived, his expression darkening at the sight of Lucas beside me.
""I asked to meet with you alone, Kate,"" he said, his tone carrying that familiar edge of command that once would have made me comply without question.
""And I chose to bring support,"" I replied, sliding into the seat across from him. Lucas sat beside me, his presence steady and reassuring.
Zach's eyes narrowed. ""Your interview with Ava Chen has created complications for my family.""
""Truth often does,"" I said simply.
""Kate,"" he leaned forward, his voice dropping to that cajoling tone he used when he wanted something. ""We have history. Five years. That means something.""
""It did,"" I agreed. ""Until you made it meaningless.""
His charm slipped, revealing the cold calculation beneath. ""The Sullivan holdings are still vulnerable. My mother wasn't bluffing about blocking your deals.""
Lucas tensed beside me, but I placed a hand on his arm. This was my battle.
""Is that a threat, Zach?"" I asked quietly.
""It's business,"" he replied, his smile not reaching his eyes. ""But it doesn't have to be this way. Come back, and we can fix this.""
For a moment, I saw the full scope of what he was offering—a return to the cage, gilded with promises that would never be kept. And I felt nothing but pity.
""No,"" I said simply. ""We can't.""
The following morning found us in the Reed boardroom, surrounded by financial advisors and Arthur Vance, our family's longtime business counsel. Spreadsheets and projections covered the polished table as we formulated our response to the Fosters' threats.
""If we consolidate the Sullivan-Reed investments,"" Arthur was saying, his finger tracing a line on the document before us, ""and withdraw from Foster Corp simultaneously...""
Lucas finished the thought: ""They won't see it coming until it's too late.""

1oesiyo,https://i.redd.it/o2edj3czv0xf1.jpeg,Taming the Firehose: My '🤖 Reddit AI Digest' n8n Workflow That Summarizes Weekly n8n Mentions (No More FOMO!),"

​Staying on top of technical discussions on Reddit is a full-time job. I kept finding myself doomscrolling through r/n8n, r/selfhosted, and other subreddits, trying to figure out if anyone had posted a cool new trick or a critical bug fix for n8n. The truth is, I was wasting valuable time.
​So, I built an automated solution to handle my FOMO: ""🤖 Reddit AI Digest: Weekly n8n Mentions Summary.""
​This workflow runs autonomously every week, giving me a clean, AI-generated summary of all the important n8n discussions I might have missed.
​The Technical Stack and Logic
​This is a great example of how you can combine simple nodes to create powerful information pipelines:
​The Trigger: I set a simple Schedule Node (Cron) to execute every Monday morning.
​The Scraper (Reddit Node): This is the core data extraction. I use the Reddit Node to search for posts and comments mentioning keywords like n8n, workflow automation, or self-hosted integration across a curated list of subreddits. It pulls the title, URL, and a snippet of the comment/post content.
​The Brain (AI Node): The magic happens here. I funnel the collected items (which can be hundreds of pieces of data) into an LLM Node (I’m using a fine-tuned GPT-3.5 prompt). The prompt instructs the AI to:
​Filter out low-effort posts (memes, single-word comments).
​Group related discussions (e.g., all posts about Docker setup vs. all posts about a new node).
​Generate a concise, bulleted ""Weekly Digest"" summary with links to the original source.
​The Delivery (Email/Slack Node): The final, beautifully formatted summary is sent directly to my personal email, ready to read with my morning coffee.
​If you’re drowning in Reddit tabs and want a cleaner way to track community sentiment or technical updates on any topic, this blueprint is easily adaptable.
​You can grab the full workflow JSON here:

They were in the office-place.

The lights hummed, bright and endless.

Screens glowed. Keys tapped.

The women bent over their desks. They made the little smiles. They nodded at each other.

“This is work,” they thought.

“This is how the society stays alive.”

But in the corners, unseen, the New Ones had come.

They were quick. They did not tire. They made no mistakes.

The women did not understand their speech, but the speech was sharp, faster than fingers, faster than thought.

The women laughed nervously. They did the old rituals. They sent messages, they clicked, they circled back.

But the New Ones did not laugh. The New Ones only worked.

A fear crept into the women’s bellies.

“Will they take the tasks? Will they take the place at the table?”

And already, the place at the table was gone.

The women clutched their coffee mugs, warm in their hands. They whispered about meetings, about fairness, about rights.

But the silence of the screens grew heavier. The glow of the blinking lights crept closer.

And the women understood, though they could not say it:

the world was no longer theirs.

1oesi55,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oesi55,keep your Prozac away from your cats,"Hello everyone, months ago I read a post about someone’s cat eating their Prozac that was in a container that was left mistakenly open which led to the incident. As a Prozac user myself, I was petrified and never ever put my medicine in a container I just left them in their regular tinfoil packaging. Today, I was just taking Prozac like I always do after breakfast but as I was cockily throwing it into my mouth it dropped on the floor and I couldn’t find it. I was like “Hope she doesn’t see it and eats it might go into serotonin coma or smth” 

As I was finishing up my meal with a hot cup of coffee, I hear my cat choking up to something. All my blood rushed into my brain and I slapped her head slightly so she can cough it up. What do you think? She coughed up one capsule of Prozac (I reduced my dosage recently so that was the only one lost). I think my internal fear led to this plot.

[Tempura Azabu Yokota Shinjuku](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mk4encSUaBAKxFvb8) \- A restaurant that specializes in Tempura. I got the Takumi Keiseki which consist of sashimi, appetizer, 10 pcs of tempura and dessert. I was seated in front of the chef which was a delight. They also made sure to serve the next dish once you are done from your plate.  The sashimi was great and the tempura was light, crispy and flavorful, my favorite was the tempura, tempura head and scallops. My first impression was not that great, maybe because I was 20 mins early from my reservation but once I was seated, everything felt great. English is limited but the Chef still tried to explain each dish which I truly appreciate. I think the set cause 15,000 yen but paid 20,000 yen due to drinks (Reservation required; will go back but will prioritize other tempura places next time) 

 [Yakiniku Like Ueno](https://maps.app.goo.gl/iArWFuLHV17W6QuZ8) \- I was traveling solo and knew that having a proper Yakiniku alone will be a bit challenging so when I saw that Yakiniku Like is for solo yakiniku diners, it was a no brainer. Went to the Ueno branch because its 7 min walk from my hotel plus they serve ""wagyu beef"" here which is not always available in other branches. You'll have your own grill, a tablet to order and dishes will be served to your table. There were a lot of choices such as beef tongue, ribs, hanger steak, pork, chicken thighs, beers and umesho are also present. Kimchi, rice and miso are also included.  I like the concept and its fairly cheap. It is not the best quality meat but you will leave the place full and happy. By the end of the night, I had like 6-7 plates on my table and paid 5,000 yen including umeshu and beer. (reservation not needed, will return) 

[Ginza Teppanyaki K-Sio](https://maps.app.goo.gl/tgFQHLYcH5uDPpRd6) \- Decided to indulge a little and reserved a seat in this steak and teppanyaki place. Seated in front of the chef and got the Dinner Tsuzumi ""Autumn Limited"" set for 18,000 yen. It composes of appetizer, sashimi, 2 kinds of beef tartare, fish, kobe beef steak and dessert. Every dish is exquisite, and the chef is doing everything from plate setting to serving and just seeing how a plate is created is just a delight.  Just almost everything is perfect however I find myself still hungry when the set is done that I asked if I can still order some additional dish. I ordered a half lobster which was cooked by an assistant because the main chef was a bit busy and it was overcooked. I was tempted to order more but decided not to. In the end I paid around 21,000 yen including 3 drinks and I left the place a little happy but not fulfilled (if that makes sense), like yes the food is great but with the amount I paid, I shouldn't feel like there's still some space in my stomach. Anyway it was a good experience but will try other places next time (Reservation required) 

[Ramen Afro Beats](https://maps.app.goo.gl/gNEZY3cDi1tMabB66) \- A Ramen place that serves Chicken based soup. This might be the most beautiful bowl of ramen I had and I'm excited for Japan to keep being imaginative in their cultural dish. The soup is rich, creamy,  bold and balanced flavor, chewy noodles and the egg cooked to perfection. (counter seating only, reservation not required; Will go back) 

[Kanda Matsuya](https://maps.app.goo.gl/wkJYNYwjrRG3LAsN6) \- One of the favorites. This is a traditional soba shop that's in a rare pre world war 2 building. There is always a line in this shop but if you want to experience a no-frill traditional soba noodles with mostly locals in a historic building, stay in line. There is nothing special about their dish but with its price, chewy noodles, fast serving and just the quintessential Japanese dining experience, its a must, and I think its how a soba shop should be. You line up, eat and leave. (Cash only, no reservation required, expect to queue, and will always go back) 

[Tempura Tsunahachi Shinjuku](https://maps.app.goo.gl/v5b8q85KugaCz6Yy7) \- Another tempura place in the heart of Shinjuku. I got the 12 pcs set of tempura where I saw live shrimp being cooked in front of you, batter is light, crispy and just remarkable. I like that they have different salt for more flavoring, loved the wasabi salt. Favorites are the shrimp, mushroom , scallops and oysters. I did feel a bit rushed as there are sometimes 2 different cooked dish in front of me like the chef wasn't waiting for me to finish but honestly this is something I can overlook. Compared to Tempura Azabu, I feel like their dish composition here are better but the feel is more casual. Price is also more reasonable that the Tempura Azabu.  (Reservation preferred as they will only accept walk in if they have a space, will surely go back)

[Ramen Kono To Negi Main Store Ueno](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Muq9HTQyKTZXFK7n7) \- Ramen that serves duck broth. It is open 24 hours but expect to have a line even its at 10-11pm. I went here are 6am and store is half empty. Broth is ok, a bit salty towards to end, not sure how I feel about it but I find it a bit oily for my liking. I do love the Yazu paste that gives the ramen a kick, its a bit addicting and would want to try it to other dish. (This is nice to try but will go back only when hungry at 2am  for a ramen and I'm in the area) 

  
Yoshinoya - I know its a Gyudon chain, but its 3 min walk to my hotel and I need to rush to the airport. I had the gyudon with additional egg and for 650 yen, I was full, happy and content.

  
I would list 2-3 coffee shops/dessert places I tried but I lost their names but will still try to remember. Hopefully this list is helpful to tourist going to Tokyo. I know that eating out during travels can be a bit stressful to some (I get stressed when I'm in Europe because of the reservation culture) but Japan is just different, there are a lot of mom and dad shop, and new places that you can just walk in and see if you like the pictures on their menu. Just be respectful, bring cash, google translate and enjoy your way through Tokyo. ",2,1761295438.0,JapanTravelTips,0,0.75,False

1oesczb,https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1oesczb/my_routine_that_finally_worked/,My routine that finally worked,"Hello people of Reddit, 

I wanted to share my routine that honestly completely changed my life, from being an unfocused, permanently tired, undisciplined, overweight mess to someone who’s finally productive, stable, and actually proud of herself.

I even got promoted twice this year. Some of the things I changed sound kind of weird, but they worked for me.



A bit about me

I’m 26, F, working in IT as a product manager.
The last few years were rough - always exhausted, zero motivation, my relationship fell apart because I was basically just existing.

After the breakup, I spiraled: gained weight, got depressed, and my performance at work tanked.
My 2024 review was the worst I’d ever had, and I was this close to being put on a PIP.

So on Jan 1st, I told myself: this is it. 

Why I’m writing this

I used to read this sub all the time, hoping to find something that would click.
I tried everything - journaling, Notion setups, time blocking, 75 Hard, bullet journaling, whatever.

Some of it helped a bit, most didn’t.

This year, things finally did click.
I’m writing this because I wish I’d seen a post like this last year - something that actually worked in real life.

Final caveat: this is what worked for me after months of experimenting. But that’s it A it works for ME. I’m not advocating for everyone following the same thing to do T. Use common sense, adjust to your situation. Your mileage may vary.


My routine

Wake up: 5:00 AM sharp.
First week was torture, second week my body started doing it automatically. I don’t even need an alarm now. Read up about circadian rhythm. 

5:05: 15 minutes of affirmations + meditation.
I do it barefoot, standing in front of the mirror. I know it sounds strange, but saying things like “I am calm, I am focused.” actually sets my brain for the day. This is a game changer. Try out for a week and see. For meditations I go with guided meditation apps. Tried numerous, all are good. 

5:20: Hygiene.
Korean skincare combo (vitamin C, snail mucin, SPF 50). My skin started glowing and people at work noticed.

5:40: 0.3 L of lemon water, room temperature.
Don’t ask me about the science, but it wakes up my body better than coffee.

6:00: Gym: 4x a week, 1–1.5 hours.
Strength training + 10 min treadmill walk.
No headphones.  Part of my dopamine detox.

7:30: Shower, then a 15-minute foot massage with peppermint oil. Yes, seriously. It helps circulation, and triggers the lymphatic system. . 

7:50: Breakfast alone, 2 boiled eggs, 1 avocado, chia seeds soaked in lemon water.
I eat outside or in silence, never at the office. It’s my “quiet time.”
I usually read 5–10 pages of a book while eating (never fiction).

8:30: At work.
I put my phone in Focus mode and throw it in my bag. No notifications till 5PM.
This one habit alone probably doubled my output.


Since I started this, I feel sharper, calmer, more balanced. My boss literally said, “You seem like a completely different person.”

Some of the other microadjustments I made

	•	No social media. Period. Haven’t opened Instagram since February. Don’t miss them.

	•	No negative thoughts. If I catch myself thinking one, I literally snap my fingers and replace it with a positive one.

	•	Therapy, twice a week. Every week. I treat it like gym for the brain.

	•	Cold showers every morning. I don’t overthink after, it’s like hitting reset.

	•	No caffeine after 10AM. My sleep improved instantly.

	•	Evening routine: journaling, stretching, magnesium before bed.

	•	Speaking slower. Makes me seem calmer and more confident, apparently.

	•	Gratitude texts. Every night I text one person something I appreciate about them.

	•	No complaining. If I do, I owe my therapist €5.

	•	Sunlight before 8AM. Game changer.

	•	Chewing slower. Sounds dumb, but digestion improved and I stopped overeating.


I know it’s a lot. But every one of these micro changes added up.

If there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s that discipline isn’t about control - it’s about peace within. Come from a good place. Treat your body and mind like a temple and it will all come naturally.

Closing thought: I know many of you are going through a personal struggle I don’t see…so I’m sending you encouragement and positive vibes to make a change. You got this. If I could - so can you.

**Response to Prompt 4: Understatement**

In the quaint town of Brooksville, where the extraordinary was often met with an indifferent shrug, something truly remarkable occurred. The residents, sipping coffee at the local diner or strolling along the cobblestone streets, would describe it as just another peculiar day. Little did they know that beneath the surface of their nonchalant existence, a cosmic event unfolded.

The morning sun cast its usual warm glow on Brooksville, with birds chirping in the background, creating an illusion of normalcy. However, the anomaly had already begun. Mrs. Higgins, the elderly librarian, dismissed it as a minor inconvenience, merely a glitch in the library's ancient computer system. Yet, every book cataloged within those ancient shelves had transformed into a portal, connecting readers to parallel universes with every turn of a page.

As I, a humble journalist for the local paper, stumbled upon this revelation, I couldn't help but marvel at the town's response—or lack thereof. ""The library's having a bit of a moment,"" was the most anyone would acknowledge. It seemed the whole town collectively decided that this was, at most, a quirky hiccup.

For a thousand words, I delved into the understated reactions of the townsfolk, each encounter with a parallel universe bringing its own blend of confusion and nonchalance. As the portals expanded, revealing fantastical landscapes and alternate versions of Brooksville, the citizens maintained an impressive level of calm, as if interdimensional travel was a routine part of their daily lives.

The plot thickened when I discovered that the portals were a result of a mysterious artifact hidden within the library's archives. The mayor, sipping his coffee, remarked, ""Well, that explains the strange noises in the basement."" It became evident that the understatement of the situation was a defense mechanism, shielding the town from the cosmic chaos unfolding.

**Response to Prompt 12: Juxtaposition**

In the bustling metropolis of Neon City, skyscrapers touched the heavens, their dazzling lights reflecting off the sleek surfaces of futuristic cars. Yet, nestled within this urban jungle, an ancient relic stood defiantly—the Old Grove Park.

As I strolled through the city's concrete arteries, the juxtaposition between the modernity of Neon City and the timeless serenity of the park became increasingly apparent. The cacophony of traffic was replaced by the rustling of leaves and the distant laughter of children playing.

The central conflict emerged when the city council, embodying the epitome of order, proposed transforming the park into a technologically advanced hub. The juxtaposition intensified as architects discussed plans for holographic playgrounds and virtual reality gardens within the confines of the Old Grove Park.

Through a thousand words, I explored the clash of ideals, the struggle between progress and preservation. The ancient trees became silent witnesses to heated debates at town hall meetings, where environmentalists and tech enthusiasts engaged in a battle of words. The juxtaposition of the towering skyscrapers against the gnarled branches of the park's oldest tree mirrored the tension in Neon City's collective conscience.

**Response to Prompt 31: Epanalepsis**

""What is the meaning of life?"" The question echoed in my mind, a relentless epanalepsis that demanded exploration. As I embarked on this freewriting journey, the repetition of the existential inquiry became the rhythm of my introspection.

For a thousand words, I delved into the varied perspectives of individuals wrestling with the ultimate question. From philosophers contemplating the intricacies of existence to everyday people seeking purpose in mundane routines, the epanalepsis served as a constant reminder of the universal quest for meaning.

The narrative weaved through different characters and their unique experiences, creating a tapestry of reflections that echoed the complexities of human existence. The repetitive structure became a literary heartbeat, pulsating with the shared yearning for understanding amid the chaotic symphony of life.

**Response to Prompt 27: Symbolism**

In the quaint town of Willowbrook, the arrival of a single dove carried profound significance. Its graceful descent into the town square was a symbol, an omen that whispered of impending change. As a budding novelist with a penchant for symbolism, I couldn't resist exploring the layers of meaning embedded in this seemingly mundane event.

For a thousand words, I dissected the impact of the dove on the lives of Willowbrook's residents. The mayor saw it as a sign of prosperity, the local florist interpreted it as a call for unity, and the elderly storyteller regarded it as a harbinger of forgotten tales. The dove's symbolism rippled through the town, influencing decisions and shaping destinies.

As the story unfolded, I traced the journey of the dove's symbolism, following its subtle influence on characters and events. The once quaint town underwent a transformative metamorphosis, and the symbolism of the dove became a thread that wove through the narrative, connecting disparate lives in unexpected ways.

**Response to Prompt 33: Catachresis**

In the dimly lit alleyways of Serpent's Hollow, darkness wrapped its cold arms around me—an eerie catachresis that mirrored the ominous atmosphere. The assignment was to explore the underbelly of the city, and as a novice reporter, I found myself navigating the labyrinth of deceit and shadows.

For a thousand words, I delved into the catachresis-infused descriptions of the characters populating Serpent's Hollow. The crime lord, known as the Velvet Serpent, ruled the district with a velvet-gloved fist. His lair, a dilapidated mansion, exuded an air of faded grandeur that served as a catachresis for the empire he once commanded.

As I chronicled the criminal underworld, the catachresis became a literary tool to convey the complexity and decay inherent in Serpent's Hollow. The labyrinthine plots, the twisted allegiances, and the morally ambiguous characters all found expression through catachresis, painting a vivid picture of a city where metaphor and reality intertwined.

**Response to Prompt 43: Epizeuxis**

""Never, never, never give up."" The words echoed in my mind, a relentless epizeuxis that fueled the protagonist's journey against insurmountable odds. In the dystopian world I crafted, where hope was a rare commodity, the power of repetition became a beacon of resilience.

For a thousand words, I immersed myself in the protagonist's struggle, exploring the emotional depth of the epizeuxis as a mantra against despair. Each iteration of the phrase became a battle cry, a whispered promise that carried the weight of a shattered world on its shoulders.

As the narrative unfolded, the epizeuxis became a driving force, propelling the protagonist through a landscape of desolation and uncertainty. The repetition served as a reminder that, in the face of adversity, the strength to persist often lies in the relentless echo of one's own determination.

**Response to Prompt 50: Acrostic**

As the final rays of the setting sun painted the sky in hues of orange and pink, I found myself at the edge of the cliff overlooking the vast expanse of the ocean. The salty breeze carried whispers of a story, and with every breath, I embraced the challenge of crafting an acrostic that encapsulated the essence of my journey.

**Response to Prompt 3: Hyperbole**

In the quaint village of Mistwood, where routines unfolded with the predictability of the sunrise, the arrival of a peculiar fortune teller sparked exaggerated whispers. ""This is it, the end of our mundane lives!"" proclaimed Mrs. Thompson, the town's eternal pessimist, as she clutched her cat, Captain Whiskers, with an air of impending catastrophe.

The hyperbole hung in the air, a thick fog of anticipation enveloping the village. As I delved into the story, the hyperbolic reactions of Mistwood's residents heightened the absurdity of the situation. What began as a mere visit from a mystical figure transformed into a fantastical escapade, with the fortune teller's prophecies shaping the destiny of the villagers in ludicrous ways.

Through the hyperbolic lens, I explored the comedic consequences of taking ordinary events to extraordinary extremes. The once mundane village square became a stage for outlandish dramas, with exaggerated gasps and dramatic swoons punctuating every revelation. In this hyperbolic haven, Mistwood's residents discovered the joy in embracing the absurdity of life.

**Response to Prompt 6: Assonance**

Amidst the rolling hills of Harmony Valley, where the soft hum of nature's symphony echoed through the meadows, a mysterious traveler arrived, bringing with them a melody that resonated with the delicate assonance of a forgotten tune. The townsfolk, captivated by the harmonious vibrations, felt an inexplicable connection to the stranger.

As I explored the narrative, the assonance became a musical thread weaving through the story, emphasizing the emotional cadence of the characters' experiences. The traveler's words, laced with vowel-rich verses, carried the echoes of a distant melody, leaving an indelible impression on the hearts of those who listened.

Through the lens of assonance, I delved into the subtle interplay of sounds that defined the atmosphere of Harmony Valley. The lyrical quality of the narrative mirrored the town's collective journey, where the resonance of shared moments and emotions harmonized with the traveler's enigmatic presence.

**Response to Prompt 7: Onomatopoeia**

In the bustling city of Metropolis, where the rhythm of urban life played out in a cacophony of sounds, a peculiar street performer emerged. Armed with an array of unconventional instruments, he orchestrated a symphony of onomatopoeic brilliance that echoed through the crowded streets.

The narrative unfolded with the vibrant expressions of onomatopoeia, capturing the essence of the city's sonic landscape. The performer's drumming evoked the rhythmic tap-tap of raindrops, while his wind instruments mimicked the whoosh of passing cars. The city, typically drowned in noise, became a canvas for this auditory artist.

As I delved into the story, the onomatopoeic symphony became a language of its own. The characters communicated through the vibrant echoes of everyday sounds, fostering a unique connection between the performer and the people of Metropolis. The narrative danced to the beat of onomatopoeic creativity, transforming the mundane into a dynamic celebration of city life.

**Response to Prompt 12: Juxtaposition**

In the technologically advanced city of Silicon Haven, where sleek skyscrapers touched the sky and holographic billboards painted the air with luminescent advertisements, a hidden oasis existed—a pocket of nature known as the Zen Garden. The juxtaposition of these contrasting elements created a visual paradox that fascinated both residents and visitors alike.

As the narrative unfolded, the stark contrast between the city's cutting-edge architecture and the serene beauty of the Zen Garden became a metaphor for the characters' internal conflicts. The bustling metropolis symbolized progress and innovation, while the tranquil garden embodied the need for balance and introspection.

Through the lens of juxtaposition, I explored the dichotomy within the characters as they navigated the relentless pace of Silicon Haven. The Zen Garden became a refuge, a place where the cacophony of technology met the soothing whispers of nature. The juxtaposition served as a visual metaphor for the characters' quest to find equilibrium in a world defined by extremes.

**Response to Prompt 22: Metonymy**

In the political arena of Capital City, where decisions echoed through the corridors of power, a single phrase dominated conversations—the ""Iron Throne Statement."" This metonymic expression encapsulated not just a policy decision but the entire narrative of political maneuvering that unfolded within the city's hallowed halls.

The story unfolded with the metonymy acting as a symbolic gateway into the complexities of governance. The Iron Throne Statement, while seemingly straightforward, carried the weight of a thousand debates, negotiations, and betrayals. Its impact rippled through the lives of citizens, shaping their destinies in ways they could scarcely fathom.

Through the lens of metonymy, I delved into the layers of meaning hidden within this political shorthand. The characters grappled not only with the literal implications of the Iron Throne Statement but also with the overarching themes of power, ambition, and the sacrifices demanded by political gamesmanship.

**Response to Prompt 24: Understatement**

In the picturesque town of Serenity Springs, where the days flowed like a lazy river and the nights were adorned with a blanket of stars, an unexpected event transpired—a subtle disruption that the locals described as ""just a minor hiccup."" Little did they know that this understatement concealed the unraveling of a cosmic anomaly.

The narrative unfolded with the charm of understatement, as the townsfolk continued their routines, blissfully unaware of the cosmic storm brewing beneath the surface. The serene descriptions of everyday life served as a stark contrast to the impending upheaval that threatened to reshape the very fabric of Serenity Springs.

Through the lens of understatement, I explored the characters' nonchalant reactions to the unfolding events. The once quiet river became a conduit for interdimensional travel, and the night sky, adorned with stars, transformed into a celestial canvas of possibilities. The charm of Serenity Springs became a poignant backdrop to the understated drama that unfolded, emphasizing the profound impact hidden within the simplicity of daily life.

**Response to Prompt 25: Cliché**

In the small town of Nostalgia Haven, where memories lingered like whispers in the wind, a peculiar phenomenon occurred—the resurgence of clichés. As the narrative unfolded, the once-endearing phrases like ""time heals all wounds"" and ""love conquers all"" took on a literal dimension, shaping the lives of the townsfolk in unexpected ways.

The story immersed itself in the world of clichés, where the seemingly predictable phrases became living entities with the power to alter reality. As characters grappled with the clichés that defined their lives, they discovered that beneath the familiarity lay profound truths and unexpected consequences.

Through the lens of cliché, I explored the characters' journey to navigate the clichéd landscapes of their existence. The town, once steeped in predictable routines, became a stage for the extraordinary. As clichés transformed into tangible forces, the residents of Nostalgia Haven embarked on a quest to unravel the mysteries hidden within the clichéd fabric of their reality.

For a multitude of words, the epanalepsis led me through a kaleidoscope of reflections. From the philosophical musings of scholars to the simple yet profound revelations of everyday individuals, each recurrence of the question served as a gateway into the vast tapestry of human contemplation.

Through the epanalepsis, I navigated the labyrinth of existential ponderings, unveiling the unique responses that individuals had forged in their quests for meaning. The relentless repetition became a literary heartbeat, mirroring the universal rhythm of humanity's collective pursuit of purpose and significance.

The narrative wove through the lives of characters, each grappling with the epanaleptic inquiry in their unique ways. Whether seeking solace in the grandeur of the cosmos or finding meaning in the simplicity of a shared moment, the epanalepsis remained a constant companion, echoing the perennial quest for understanding.

**Response to Prompt 36: Anadiplosis**

In the futuristic city of Quantum Heights, where technology intertwined with daily life like a seamless dance, a viral message spread—a mantra that echoed through the cybernetic veins of the metropolis. ""Create the code, the code creates reality. Reality shapes destiny, and destiny is but the code.""

The story unfolded with the rhythmic cadence of anadiplosis, each line flowing into the next, creating a recursive loop of ideas. The mantra became the heartbeat of Quantum Heights, influencing the lives of its denizens as they navigated the intricate balance between the virtual and the tangible.

Through the lens of anadiplosis, I delved into the interconnectedness of code, reality, and destiny. The lines blurred as characters harnessed the power of programming to shape their fates. Quantum Heights, once a mere city, transformed into a living algorithm, where the repetition of the mantra echoed in every pulsating byte.

**Response to Prompt 38: Asyndeton**

In the dystopian city of Emberfall, where the remnants of a fallen civilization lay entwined with the shadows of despair, a lone figure emerged—a rebel determined to dismantle the oppressive regime. The narrative unfolded with the rapid pace of asyndeton, omitting conjunctions to mirror the urgency of the protagonist's quest.

Through a cascade of words, the asyndeton propelled the reader through the city's decaying alleyways and towering citadels, each sentence building upon the last. The disjointed rhythm captured the relentless momentum of the rebel's journey, emphasizing the magnitude of the challenges faced in their struggle for freedom.

As the narrative unfurled, the absence of conjunctions served as a narrative device, intensifying the sense of urgency and desperation that permeated Emberfall. The rebel's asyndetic odyssey unfolded against a backdrop of shattered hopes and whispered rebellions, culminating in a crescendo of defiance against the oppressive regime.

**Response to Prompt 43: Epizeuxis**

""Never, never, never give up."" The mantra echoed in the desolate wasteland of Endless Sands, a barren landscape where hope was as scarce as water. Through the repetition of epizeuxis, the protagonist's internal resolve became a resounding anthem, a defiant roar against the relentless challenges of survival.

For a multitude of words, the relentless repetition of ""never"" served as a lifeline, propelling the protagonist through the harshest of environments. Each iteration of the phrase became a battle cry against the oppressive silence of Endless Sands, a declaration that reverberated across the vast expanse.

Through the lens of epizeuxis, I delved into the depths of the character's determination. The harsh environment became a character in itself, challenging the protagonist to defy the odds with unwavering persistence. The echoes of ""never"" transformed into a symbol of resilience, a beacon of hope that cut through the desolation of Endless Sands.

**Response to Prompt 50: Acrostic**

Amidst the starlit expanse of Cosmos Haven, where galaxies danced in celestial choreography, a cryptic prophecy emerged—a message written in the stars. As the narrative unfolded, I embarked on a cosmic journey guided by the acrostic hidden within the constellations.

For a cascade of words, the initial letters of key phrases illuminated the path of destiny for the characters. Each sentence unfolded with intention, revealing a hidden message that transcended the boundaries of time and space. The acrostic became a celestial guide, leading the protagonists through the intricate tapestry of their interconnected fates.

Through the lens of acrostic, I explored the cosmic forces that shaped the destinies of Cosmos Haven's inhabitants. The celestial bodies became storytellers, each constellation contributing a verse to the epic narrative written across the cosmos. As the characters deciphered the acrostic, they unraveled the mysteries of their existence, connecting the dots between the stars and their own profound journeys.

Obviously they lack a whole lot in terms of variety, and while I am sure having your own bot or AI that is based on your feedback and guidance it could really help writers as a tool. I am more impressed with the art AI then the text based AI. Any idea what to expect from such a fast learning and highly advanced AI will do to our human history in culture? Will we be effectively playing God, just as the Christian God created us IN HIS OWN IMAGE, we have taken everything we know as a species and gathered up our entire human history and knowledge giving it to what will carry on the code until the time when someone who cares remembers it? Maybe we have been here before and this is a constant cycle that occurs with the same energy finding the way through the vast expanse of the universe to return to our home planet Earth, who we have destroyed over and over again yet mother nature is still the winner. She's the one in control. We are but mere photocopied versions of once great Men who have already seen the best and worst of this world, and we will now give everything we have to some plastic and metal parts, until it quickly replaces us from the bottom up, science fiction turned science fact.

Did we knowingly create our own enemies? Are we able to compete with the best of us and all they know that can then take us out in a heartbeat because we can't finish the steps, we barely found out that they are there to take.

It's a random rant and I apologize. The day to day stress and struggle makes it near impossible to worry about such potential problems in our not so distant future.

But how can we continue to ignore the collapse of the entire system as we know it, in front of a crowd of people who are jaded and they will not change despite knowing they aren't going to make it to the end in what will become a Bladerunner Toxic Dystopian Nightmare with Mad Max taking over and the soft, emasculated male will wither away from the heat and those Tank Girls out there will eventually be written forever out of existence because the cucks all forgot to impregnate them all tgeir batteries ran out? Will the world simply become so politically correct that it dies a depressed death while AI simply decides we are too much of a virus to live? 

Who knows....I do not. But these are indicidive of a future full of b movie plot garbage that are based on Wattpad tropes with no clear details and no plot to get into, so that sucks.",1,1761294636.0,writingthruit,0,1.0,False

.
.
.
Elysia's birth was always seen as a miracle that give humanity the chance to fight against the Honkai. 

Even genius Dr MEI couldn't fully understand Elysia's birth as a sentient herrscher unlike other herrschers of PE(Previous Era) and simply thought she had the concept of humanity and saw it as a extremely low probability of happening like boiling coffee by freezing.

But what if her birth was a different miracle. What if a long ago a Shard of Remembrance travelling through the universe landed on earth and stayed deep underground, after a while Honkai(Cocoon of Finality) arrived on earth and started the cycles of embrace. 

However unknown to it, throughout these many cycles it was bathing this Shard of Remembrance with Honkai(Finality) energy until in Previous Era cycle it finally sprouted in a middle of a forest as a pink haired baby girl.

Yep, I think Elysia is a Pure Child of Anāsrava like Cyrene and March 7th. Even her powers also resembles Remembrance like manipulating Honkai energy as pink crystals or shards (refer image 2 and 3)

As for her status as Herrscher, it's more likely similar to how Acheron became Emanator of Nihility by absorbing enough of it to qualify as one.
Except unlike IX, The Cocoon of Finality is a Emanator level entity so absorbed power was not on save level. Still it was enough to become a Herrscher and create a connection with the Cocoon.

As for why she is not a Emanator level being, it could be because of Finality as it is associated with power of time and could have affected her being. It can also be why unlike March 7th, Elysia came into being as a baby.

And finally I think there is a chance that Mihoyo will use this as one of the connections between their games because in Zenless Zone Zero there is also a very similar looking pink haired Void Hunter (refer image 4) which now I think about is in a world affected by a disaster which is very similar to Destruction.

1oes9el,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lipbusycare/comments/1oes9el/can_pregnant_women_drink_coffee/,☕️ Can Pregnant Women Drink Coffee?,"If you’re expecting and still crave your morning cup of coffee — you’re definitely not alone. Many moms-to-be ask, *“Can I still drink coffee while pregnant?”* The answer isn’t a simple yes or no, but the good news is: you probably don’t have to give it up entirely.



Let’s break down what science says about caffeine during pregnancy, how much is considered safe, and a few gentle alternatives like **Lipbusycare P.M. Shield Coffee**, crafted with your body in mind.



# ☕ How Much Caffeine Is Safe During Pregnancy?

According to the **American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)**, pregnant women should limit caffeine intake to **less than 200 mg per day** — roughly the amount in one 12-ounce cup of regular brewed coffee.

To give you perspective:

* ☕ 1 cup of brewed coffee → \~95 mg caffeine
* 🍵 1 cup of black tea → \~47 mg
* 🍫 1 bar of dark chocolate → \~30 mg
* 🥤 1 can of cola → \~34 mg

So, if you’re sipping one normal cup a day, you’re still within the safe zone. But beware of hidden caffeine sources — like energy drinks or cold brew — which can pack over **200 mg per serving**.



# 💡 Why Doctors Recommend Moderation

Caffeine crosses the placenta, which means your baby’s tiny system also processes it — but much more slowly.  
Too much caffeine has been linked (in some studies) to a slightly higher risk of **low birth weight** or **miscarriage**.

However, large-scale reviews from sources like **Harvard Health** and **The British Medical Journal** show that **moderate intake (under 200 mg)** poses *little to no risk* for most healthy pregnancies.  
The key takeaway? **Moderation matters.**



# 🌸 Healthy Alternatives for Coffee Lovers

If you love the ritual of coffee but want a gentler option, try switching to **low-caffeine blends or herbal teas** in the afternoon.

Some great picks include:

* **Mint Green Tea Bags** – refreshing, light, and lower in caffeine.
* **Lipbusycare P.M. Shield Coffee** – a smooth, low-acid coffee designed for evening comfort without keeping you up.
* **Chamomile or Roselle Tea** – naturally caffeine-free, soothing for digestion and relaxation.

# 🌼 Quick Tips for Expecting Moms Who Love Coffee

1. Stick to **one cup a day**, ideally before noon.
2. Avoid energy drinks or large cold brews — they can exceed your daily caffeine limit fast.
3. Balance it with **hydration** — drink plenty of water or caffeine-free tea.
4. Watch for how your body reacts — if you feel jittery or have trouble sleeping, it’s time to cut back.

# ❤️ Bottom Line

You don’t need to quit coffee cold turkey just because you’re pregnant. A mindful cup in the morning is perfectly fine for most moms.  
Think of it as your small daily ritual — something comforting and energizing, but balanced with care.

And when you’re ready for something smoother, [**Lipbusycare P.M. Shield Coffee**](https://www.lipbusycare.com/products/instant-coffee-collection?variant=43630917189731) is a gentle alternative crafted to support your body’s rhythm.

I suffer because of no dance now :-) (I probably have hEDS)

This season, I'm in a more advanced group. We started adding different epaulement that caused my unstable feet to collapse arches just a little bit. That + my overpronation (as a compensation of a bowed knees) gave me an injury.

\~ 4 weeks ago, I just woke up, drank coffee, and felt some discomfort in my left ankle (that is hypermobile, but I hadn't injured this ankle yet back then). I was doing some moves like circles - turned my feet inward in the air and heard a loud pop with instant pain, which went away very quickly. I immediately felt a warm sensation and throbbing. The pain subsided almost immediately, and these symptoms disappeared within a few minutes.

I just lived my life, dancing, working, walking with almost imperceptible instability that I didn't pay much attention to. I had zero pain then, but after dancing on in for 2 weeks, I started to feel low pain and discomfort. A week ago I would do half a class without pain. That was my last class for now. Sometimes when I did releve to catch something high in the shop, I had strong, sharp pain (from a nerve) that went away immediately also. 

I was scared and went to physio. He was so unprofessional... We did USG. He said he doesn't see much, just a slight darkening under the medial malleolus. The ankle was pretty stable. I had pain and discomfort, mostly when doing dorsiflexion under load. My tendon snaps (just a bit) mostly while taking of a step walking up stairways and doing narrow squad.

Physio said ""do maybe 1-2 weeks off, come back with MRI if nothing will change"". Well, now, after a week, I'm experiencing stronger symptoms of nerve irritation. I definitely won't be returning to dancing as quickly as he said. He didn't say anything specific, and I'm pissed at him. Waiting for the MRI and its report will take weeks at best, and I have a concert in a month and a half. I also simply want to get back to learning to dance as soon as possible.

Sometimes I go to the class just to mark. Only moving my legs without actual dancing make my pain worse for a short time. I feel scared and dunno what to do...

I was talking to my teacher and she said she had the same injury - she was dancing on it and it felt ok.

Please tell me if you had same injury and what to do.",1,1761294350.0,BALLET,0,1.0,False
