Now whenever I hear words like competition, challenge, self-development, do more, great minds, I genuinely feel sick. I’m completely numb to it.

I followed the whole “successful” path for years — selective schools, full scholarship in a very crowded country, extra languages, musical instruments, programming — all of it, if I’m honest, for social approval. At the same time, I constantly managed how I looked, spoke, and even my body language to appear calm, soft and “likeable”. That kind of invisible effort is real, but no one ever acknowledges it.

I moved to the UK for my Master’s (not a top target university — scholarships were limited for internationals unless you came from an extremely disadvantaged background, and my family finances had a hard cap). I burned out badly after the MSc because of adaptation and serious financial stress that I never really told anyone about.

After that, I joined a Big 4 firm in the UK for the same old reason: SOCIAL APPROVAL, From the outside, people always saw me as easygoing, social, confident, reliable. Inside, something switched off. Now I openly hate hustle culture and the constant qualification flexing — “I am this, I have that” — and I can literally feel how that makes colleagues see me as “not very bright” as I am showing my numbness to those openly. To me, it’s all just boring.

What I genuinely don’t understand is why people in Big4 see this lifestyle as something to be grateful for. Managers not seeing their newborn babies for weeks is spoken about like it’s some badge of honour. I can’t bring myself to see how that equals success.

And lately, I keep thinking about a life that’s the complete opposite of all this. Working as a barista. Learning coffee properly. One day opening a small café with a close friend. Most people say, “If that’s what you want, just do it.” But when you’ve built your whole identity around external approval, stepping away from that feels terrifying.

If I’m completely honest, my biggest fear isn’t money or hard work. It’s the idea of serving coffee to my current colleagues — in the same area — and being silently judged by managers who once bullied me. The thought of being seen as a “loser” from those managers bothers me more than it probably should.

I know this might sound messy, contradictory or even immature. But this is where I am.
I feel lost. I’m deeply bored of competition, hustle and grind culture.
And I genuinely don’t know what I’m supposed to replace it with.

Has anyone in the UK actually walked away from a high-status corporate path into something simpler and not regretted it? Or is this just burnout talking?",1,1764982585.0,Accounting,0,1.0,False

I’m a 36-year-old guy from New England, and like a lot of people here, I’ve never been in a relationship. It wasn’t for lack of trying — shyness, bad timing, and life just kept getting in the way. But I’ve been working on myself, opening up more socially, and I’m genuinely ready to connect with someone.

A bit about me:
Firstly I have some sort of fame, if thats what you call it. I made a dating site promoting my singleness DatingKen.com which caught news in Boston and Matt Sheer a reporter social media. I’m a huge nerd who loves conventions, gaming, and cosplay. It’s been an amazing community for me, and I’ve met some great friends through it. I cosplay characters like Eddie Munson from Stranger Things and Leon from Resident Evil. I stay active, take care of myself, and oddly enough, I’m freakishly lucky with raffles and giveaways (no clue why, but I’ll take it).

I’m looking for someone kind, patient, and down-to-earth. You don’t need to cosplay — just be someone who enjoys nerdy stuff or at least doesn’t mind it. I’m not expecting perfection; I just want a genuine connection with someone who understands what it’s like to navigate dating later than most.

If you’re local, maybe we could start with something simple like coffee. No pressure — just two people seeing if there’s a spark.

I’m looking for some career advice from people who’ve gone through firm or service-line transitions.

I’m currently a SALT (State & Local Tax) Associate in WA. I enjoy the technical side of tax and have built strong relationships on my team, but this past busy season was extremely tough — to the point where I was working more hours than friends in the Big 4.

It made me step back and think seriously about whether I’m in the right service line long-term.

Lately I’ve been more interested in moving into BTS (Business Tax Services) or Federal/International tax, because I want work that’s broader than SALT and offers more long-term mobility in the future.

I’m also very interested in future international opportunities, ( I was born and raised overseas) so I’m trying to align myself with roles that have global reach.

I’ve been networking through coffee chats, LinkedIn conversations, and talking with professionals across different firms and service lines.

At the same time, I don’t want to burn bridges or make a rushed move. I have mentors and managers who have genuinely supported me, and I want to be thoughtful about my next steps.

My main questions are:

When is actually the best time to start applying or making a move in public accounting? Some people say to wait until after busy season, while others say timing doesn’t matter.
(For context, I’ve already applied to a big 4 firm for a Tax Consultant role as part of exploring my options)

2) How do you leave a team you genuinely like without damaging relationships or blindsiding anyone?

3) Should I attempt an internal transfer first (SALT → BTS/Fed), or is it smarter to switch firms entirely?

4) For people who’ve made similar moves — SALT to another group, or firm to firm — what was your experience like?

5) And lastly, how do you frame your story positively to recruiters without sounding like you’re just trying to escape a bad busy season?

I’m trying to be strategic and intentional instead of acting out of burnout.

I’d really appreciate advice from anyone who’s navigated something similar. Thanks in advance.",1,1764982407.0,Accounting,0,1.0,False
1pfbyqb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mcat/comments/1pfbyqb/managing_study_stress_tactic_1_a_timeless_moment/,Managing Study Stress Tactic #1: A Timeless Moment for the Future and the Present,"The MCAT is not the end. It is the Beginning....

The MCAT necessitates dedicated time to be carved out of your calendar. Whether you take the exam in a couple months or a year, until the exam is done there will be many emotional ups and downs.

However, it is to your advantage to live as much of your day as if you will win and move forward. Borrow confidence from the future you that has already achieved what you wanted from the exam. And spend everyday replicating that feeling for a nice chunk to become accustomed to being that confident. This will reduce stress by bolstering your esteem. It will reduce how much you are affected by 1 practice set or practice exam that doesn't go your way. Im sure your life as a Doctor will be much harder. From that sense the MCAT should be something you can manage. Below is a small exercise to bring this into your timetable and experience a confidence that snowballs.

Exercise #1: Choose something to do in the day that you would do if you were already a Doctor/In Med School/Etc. Make it so simple that its existence is undeniable to your psyche so that it accepts the reframing. For example you would probably still brush your teeth, still make your coffee, still go on a walk, still talk to your spouse or parents, still play your favorite sport. Make sure you give time in your study schedule to do that activity consciously.

Exercise #2: When you are performing your chosen conscious activity, do it as if you were already the person you want to be. From that mindset, working on the MCAT will start to feel like remembering what you did to get to where you were. It is a little like Fake it till you Make it. But when you have a long road ahead with a daily study schedule that makes you feel you need to see a good mark to feel good about yourself, you need to have other check ins.

Exercise #3: Choose a more significant activity to perform that is inline with the type of physician you want to be. Maybe you want to be in public health and advocate or bring awareness to a health care issue important to you. Once again this will be something beyond the exam, but with deeper ties to your actual career objectives. Give dedicated time to this before your start your study prep. For example you could train your youtube or web browser algorithm to give you the latest news about your topic of interest and read atleast 1 article about this. When you then jump into your studying, you might find that you are super charged because you have connected with your greater mission.

As you insert these mindsets, reframes into your schedule you will find that the energy your psyche devotes to the daily outcome of exam prep will change. It will recognize that you are aiming at something more refined. It will move you from being a regular student towards career or impact oriented effort. This will reduce your stress and release energy that makes studying much more manageable for the longterm.

It has to be a ""coffee thermos"" with a built in handle. I sort of figured all thermoses could hold coffee, but I don't really know anything about them because I don't use them. They're just for keeping your hot drinks hot and your cold drinks cold yeah? With like, a vacuum air bubble between the inside and the outside so heat doesn't transfer. I think.  
  
She was very specific that the handle not be a separate thing. I'm not sure how it couldn't be, but if that's a thing that sometimes happens, I need to avoid it. Does the inside tumbler come separate from the outside bit that you hold onto, usually? I thought they were one solid piece except for like, the lid.  
  
And it needs a stainless steel lining, which I presume is inside the cuppy bit so she can wash it or won't drink microplastics or something?   
  
It also has to hold at least 16 ounces, because she mixes up a batch of some sort of fruit drink with electrolytes or vitamins or something several times throughout the day and she would like it to come in a ""bizarre"" color so that it won't be easily lost. I think this basically just means not white, brown, grey, or black. Maybe like hot pink or lime green or orange.

She has Parkinson's and has had several various mug drinky things in the past and has a tendency to drop things or bump into things, so several of them have broken. So, maybe more durable than usual.

If there's a good reliable thermos brand that meets all or at least many of these qualities, I would be appreciative.",2,1764982206.0,BuyItForLife,2,1.0,False

1pfbrr9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1pfbrr9/neckonly_bo/,Neck-Only BO,"I’ve experienced persistent, offensive cumin-like body odor emanating from my neck since 2019. It’s not responsive to treatments for bacterial overgrowth. Has anyone seen this before?

Context: 35F, no known health conditions, currently no medication/supplements. In 2019 I stopped taking Spironolactone and BC after being acne-free for nearly a decade. A few months later I noticed whifs of a foul, cumin-like odor coming from my neck (nowhere else). My partner also noticed the smell. There was no obvious trigger, never had BO problems previously. Derm suggested I take Spironolactone again, which helped at first but the problem returned. Over the years the smell became stronger & constant. My skin also produces more sebum (my face and hair always feel oily, acne is back). And while the smell is predominantly from my neck, I also notice it on my chest sometimes. It’s not my BO smell (which is different and not as strong/offensive).

There are no obvious triggers. Stress and alcohol make it worse, but it’s always there. No itching or visible markings. But some odd changes: my face and neck feel hot after mild activity (heart also racing), and I randomly get red splotches on my neck that go away within the hour. Possibly unrelated, but my libido has significantly declined and my periods are now irregular. I often have trouble sleeping (exhausted by 8 pm; wake up around 3 am).

I wash my face 2x per day; shower nightly. Not overweight. Reasonably healthy exercise routine and diet. No anxiety disorders.

I’ve seen several dermatologists. Woods lamp exam indicated bacteria (coral-colored dots); skin sample showed only “skin flora.”

The following treatments had no impact:
- Cutting coffee and alcohol
- No make up, perfume or tight clothing
- Nightly vinegar soak
- Witch Hazel applied morning/night
- Zinc diaper cream
- Antibacterial soap nightly in shower
- Lume body wash nightly in shower
- Sulphuric face wash nightly in shower (prescription)
- Clindamyacin (prescription)

Any idea what this is? Why is it only on my neck? What can I try to treat it?

It doesn’t seem to be contagious (my partner is fine). But it’s hurt my confidence and desire to be intimate. I also hesitate to hug loved ones or hold my friends babies for fear of infecting them.

1pfbqby,https://organizing.work/2018/10/on-dual-carding/,On Dual-Carding (Or how revolutionaries should approach mainstream unions),">[The **IWW** is distinct from most unions](https://www.iww.org/membership/) — we don’t collect dues through the employer, and we rely on “shop committees” of workers taking direct action in the workplace instead of contracts serviced by a paid external staff.  Using this approach, the IWW has sometimes organized at workplaces already represented by a mainstream union. This is called “***dual-carding***,” in reference to workers holding two union cards. In this piece, Nick Driedger, who participated in a vibrant and successful such campaign at Canada Post, lays out how the IWW should approach dual-carding (the article was written while he still worked at the post office).

>The broader relevance here is how those oriented to class-struggle unionism should relate to mainstream unions. –Ed.

>Below are some questions that have come up about dual-carding, and my answers.  Where I say “we,” I am making an assertion about classical IWW positions; where I say “I,” I’m stating my opinion. I do my best to keep those separate, though of course, like everyone, I fail at this a lot.

>#What is the ultimate goal of dual card organizing?

>In the IWW’s Organizer Training 101, many of the modules begin with a question to participants: “Why do this?” For example: “Why agitate?” “Why ask workers to join?” “Why follow up on tasks?” etc. Then there is a list of answers.

>I feel a bit ridiculous saying this but once I sat and thought about it, I found it hard to articulate the “why” of dual-card organizing. It’s not to decertify or raid the existing union, it’s not to reform it, it’s not to take over the existing grievance or bargaining machine…

>I think the ultimate goal is the same as in the 101: build a functioning shop committee that can mobilize workers on the floor to take direct action in their own interests.

>#How does AEIOU (Agitate, Educate, Inoculate, Organize, Unionize) work differently in the context of a union environment?

>It doesn’t.

>I don’t think that dual-card organizing is all that different, in the steps and required skills, than organizing non-unionized workplaces. Any IWW workshop on dual-carding should deliberately be a supplement to the Organizer Training 101, because I think that the basic skills are actually covered in the 101. What should be included in a dual-carding workshop is a clear description of what the IWW approach really is about: workplace committees taking direct action. I think we need to re-emphasize this in the rest of the IWW for that matter. Business Unionism with Red Flags is a real phenomenon right now.

>#What sort of backlash can be expected from the existing union when the dual-card organizing is discovered? What sort of inoculation is required before the dual-card campaign is “public”? 

>In the **[CUPW](https://www.cupw-sttp.org/)** we simply made it clear that we had no interest in becoming the certified bargaining agent for the post office and that we considered ourselves loyal CUPW members. We insisted that no workers needed permission to take action on the floor and that the officers answer to the members, not the other way around. Other than that advice, I think things may vary too much union to union to give broad prescriptions — other than trying to be clear that what we mean by “union” is very different from what, say, CUPE means by union.
How do we relate to decertification? Some wobblies at Work People’s College [an IWW event] argued that wobbly organizing should focus on decertifying “business” unions and re-certifying those workplaces as IWW shops. 

>I can only speak to our experience in Edmonton where we’ve been approached on a few occasions by workers desiring decertification of a union. Generally speaking, we’ve advised against it. The problem is, the IWW doesn’t occupy the same space other unions do, so it’s kind of illogical to replace one with the other. Usually if workers are looking to have an organization decertified, they are dissatisfied with the servicing they are getting. We won’t do a better job servicing on a skeleton budget, cheap dues and almost no paid staff.

>The average grievance in our CUPW local, taken through all the steps to arbitration, costs upwards of $10,000 per grievance. Several hundred per grievance carried through the first couple steps. In the IWW, we have voluntary dues and low dues. Financing this level of bureaucracy on bake sales isn’t really an option.

>What is the role of left caucuses? There is some feeling that left caucuses are inevitable, and could be useful. The FWs who raised this were involved in committees which are basically left caucuses: one a nascent solidarity network within OPSEU [the Ontario Public Service Employees Union], and the other working groups within CUPE [the Canadian Union of Public Employees] locals, which are hubs for activists.

>I agree left caucuses are inevitable and I participate in one in a personal capacity within CUPW. I don’t report on my activities there to the IWW nor does the IWW really seem to care about that. Not everything in the world that is politically meaningful needs to happen under the IWW banner. I’m as interested in trade union reform and getting [good representation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8PivG2wvaA) for the members as anyone else. This isn’t a revolutionary commitment however, and frankly there is nothing in it for the IWW.

>As for the “hub for activists,” generally “activists” are often not the best place to recruit good wobblies. A lot of them have career ambitions inside the union (not a problem in itself but it won’t further the IWW). Angry workers who are respected by their peers are more important. If they happen to be activists, great, but this is more important.

>#What about running slates?

>Well for a start there are a lot of stipulations in the IWW’s bylaws about being officers in other unions. Not to say you can’t do it, but we do put severe limits on this. Of course, an appeal to the rules is a cop-out, but it is important to understand why we have these rules. It’s because we have an understanding that revolutionary unionism is not simply “really progressive unionism.” Just like we advocate shop committees over shop stewards, a revolutionary position over electoralism, and avoid contractualism, our structure and function embodies a commitment to a different kind of politics. In the IWW, unions are not politically neutral bodies. Instead, their structures and commitments reflect the political perspective of their architects.

>This was clearer at a time when there was some ideological diversity in the labour movement. Since the 1960’s, there has been a social democratic hegemony in the labour movement, and the standard structures reflect this. Seizing these structures without some serious challenge to the structure itself will simply lead to cooptation, being placed in receivership, or both.
With regards to being a steward: isn’t it better that a militant do it, so at least the work gets done? Also having a legit reason to talk to co-workers about their job might make things less “weird.”

>I’m not against folks becoming stewards, but they should do this with their eyes wide open. What does “the work” entail? If the priority is to build a committee that processes demands from the floor and helps people develop a strategy for bringing pressure on the boss collectively, then I’m all for it. If the goal is simply doing what any other steward is going to do, it still isn’t a mistake, but folks should be clear they are doing it for personal reasons and not as an IWW member. The IWW doesn’t have a clear position on this.

>#How can dual carding work in multi-union environments? How can we really bring One Big Union organizing into things?

>We have some experience with this in Edmonton. The main thing is to start by actually communicating with people who work in the same station. Not just between unions but also between union and non-union workers. The advantage of direct action over the official channels is that attacking a unified management structure lets you put more pressure on them. Part of this is how you pick your demands. Prioritizing demands that affect everyone (human rights issues, parking, health and safety) allow for the broadest possible scope of action. Contractual tiffs are obviously much narrower and less useful. Joint assemblies (in our case, coffee break meetings) bring people together on the floor.

>#If wobblies can do things like get control of union newsletters, capture contact lists, etc., how should we make use of these (if we should)?

>Of course you should do these things, if you can. You should be doing everything in the 101: one-on-one meetings, identifying leaders and trying and move them towards job actions and bring them onto your committee. Newsletters can be used to publicise gains made on the floor.

>#How can you avoid co-optation by the union? i.e. when the business union claims committee victories as its own.

>The most important thing is that the workers themselves claim the victory, not the IWW. If the IWW’s role was decisive, clearly outline what the IWW did, don’t just claim credit. For example, we used education programs, promoted marches on the boss and ran an independent blog. This is different from typical lefty sloganeering which claims it was some kind of ideologically correct leadership that carried the day. Instead, it was commonsense methods used by ordinary workers.",3,1764981698.0,WorkersStrikeBack,1,1.0,False

1pfbmw4,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawofassumption/comments/1pfbmw4/how_to_build_the_self_concept_of_a_master/,How to build the Self Concept of a Master Manifestor - Part 2,"As I said in part 1 - I wanted to give everyone a bit of a roadmap.   The idea is to treat reality, creation like any other skill (e.g., learning piano) you don’t start with Rachmaninoff concertos, you start with scales. If you skip steps, you either strain and fail, or you get the manifestation but can’t hold it because your deeper worldview still says “this shouldn’t be possible.”    Also another repeat reminder that this post just like part 1 - is aimed at the character that is using law of assumption. 

# Small → Big Is the Cheat Code 

Most people try to manifest a soulmate or a million dollars on day one. Their subconscious immediately screams “IMPOSSIBLE!” and the resistance is so huge that either (a) nothing happens, or (b) it happens once in a fluke and then snaps back (the classic “I manifested $5000 but then lost it the next month” story).

By starting small, you do two things simultaneously:

* You prove to the subconscious that reality actually bends to your will. (evidence > theory).
* You gradually stretch what feels “normal” and possible, so that by the time you go for the “big” thing, it no longer feels big.

This is exactly like progressively loading more weight in the gym: 100 kg feels impossible at the start, but after months of adding 2.5 kg plates, one day you just do it.

# The Full 6-Stage Ladder

1. **Recreating the human-self identity, first and foremost** (These were covered in my first 3 questions about yourself in Part 1) Before anything else, you have to feel safe and worthy.  You have to believe in yourself and your power to manifest. 

This stage is about stabilising a healthy ego, not dissolving it yet. If you skip this, every later manifestation will feel fragile because the foundation is wobbly.

1. **Small manifestation experiments with simple techniques** Purpose: collect undeniable proof + train discipline of mind. Classic starters:
   * A free coffee or parking spot
   * Hearing a specific song within 24 h
   * Getting a random text from someone you were thinking about
   * Finding a specific small object (e.g., a red feather) Techniques used: simple affirmations, short 10-second imaginal scenes, “wouldn’t it be nice if…”, setting an intention before sleep. 

Once you have them, the subconscious starts thinking “Huh… maybe this isn’t all bullshit.”

1. **Deeper manifestation techniques**  You now upgrade tools:
   * State Akin To Sleep (SATS) scenes that loop until you fall asleep
   * 10–20 minute static visualisations with full sensory vividness
   * Breathwork + void meditation to quiet mental noise Typical manifestations at this level:
   * Specific amounts of money
   * Unexpected job offers or raises
   * Reconciliation with someone
   * Physical healing of minor-to-medium issues   The inner feeling shifts from “I hope this works” to “I know how this works.”  
2. **Larger experiments involving other people and groups** Now you’re affecting the behaviour of others in precise ways. Examples:
   * Specific Person (SP) work done cleanly (they text exact words, propose, etc.)
   * Being offered a specific role or opportunity without applying
   * Group events rearranging in your favour (wedding dates moved, trips organised around you)
   * Entire social circles shifting so you’re suddenly in the “cool” or “successful” crowd   This stage teaches you that other people are “you pushed out” and that their free will is far more malleable than society claims.  
3. **Deepest manifestation techniques –**  Tools: lucid dreaming, astral projection, void-state manifesting. At this point you’re often bypassing the waking 3D entirely and planting seeds directly in the subconscious during delta/theta states. Manifestations start looking magical to outsiders:
   * Instant physical healings
   * People from the distant past re-appearing with perfect timing
   * Synchronicities so precise they feel scripted
   * “Timeline jumps” where everyone suddenly remembers a slightly different history (Mandel effect on personal scale)  
4. **Largest experiments – fundamental changes in reality, self, and bodily habitation** This is the “graduate level”:
   * Revision of core life events (parents never divorced, different childhood country, etc.)
   * Radical body changes that medicine calls impossible
   * Jumping to an entirely different version of Earth where history unfolded differently
   * Conscious death/rebirth experiences or permanent ego dissolution while keeping the body functional
   * Manifesting entirely new identities (name, age, past, appearance) that everyone around you accepts as having always been true   

Very few reach this stage stably because it requires the complete renovation of worldview & self.

================================

If you keep flipping back to doubt, anxiety, or “checking the 3D,” it means some deeper belief (usually installed before age 7) is still running the show. Check through the beliefs I talked about in Part 1 post - Other Common culprits:

* “The world is dangerous.”
* “I’m not allowed to have it easy.”
* “Big changes only happen through suffering.”
* “Reality is fixed and objective.”

The fix is -  Install umbrella beliefs like:

* “Reality is extremely flexible and responds to me instantly.”
* “Big, beautiful changes are natural and normal for me.”
* “The bigger the desire, the faster it shows up.”

Do this systematically until “impossible” things feel mundane. Then stage 6 becomes as casual as ordering coffee.

That’s the full map: small wins → skill → confidence → bigger playgrounds → complete mastery where the concepts of “big” and “small” dissolve entirely.  
  
=============================  
  
Reality is infinitely malleable because it’s made of the same stuff you are—consciousness + belief. Change the belief, change the dream. The entire external world is a real-time printout of the ***current average of your beliefs about who you are.***

# Why Changing a Single Belief Usually doesn't work

Imagine your subconscious as a gigantic jury of 100,000 mini-beliefs that vote every second on what shows up in your life.

You try to install one new belief:

“I am a millionaire.”

The jury immediately objects with thousands of older, emotionally charged votes:

* Rich people are greedy
* Money doesn’t grow on trees
* Our family has always been middle-class
* It’s safer to stay small
* Wanting more is selfish
* I don’t deserve that much
* Unexpected money always comes with strings
* People will resent me if I have too much
* The economy is bad anyway …(and 99,990 more)

Your single new belief is out-voted 99,999 to 1. You might get a few hundred dollars here and there as a “consolation prize,” but never the full manifestation, because the average vote is still “no.”

Instead of trying to shout down the entire jury with one loud voice, you quietly retire the old jurors one by one (or in clusters) and replace them with new ones that all vote the same way.

You create an entire network of mutually reinforcing beliefs that support one another so strongly that the specific desire is no longer an outlier—it becomes the obvious, logical conclusion.

# Real-Life Example: From “Money is Hard” to “Money is Inevitable”

Old subconscious ecosystem (typical default):

* Money is scarce
* You have to work insanely hard for it
* Rich people are different from us
* Wanting money is materialistic/spiritual people are poor
* Taxes take everything anyway
* Unexpected windfalls never happen to people like me

New ecosystem you deliberately install:

1. The universe is infinitely abundant and loves to give
2. Money is just energy and flows to those who are in energetic alignment
3. Good people can be very wealthy (look at X, Y, Z examples you curate)
4. It’s safe and normal for money to increase
5. Unexpected money shows up for me all the time
6. Large sums feel completely natural to me now
7. People are happy when I thrive
8. The richer I get, the more I can help others
9. My income expands easily and constantly
10. I always have more than enough
11. Systems (taxes, economy, etc.) work in my favor
12. Wealth is my natural state

When these 12 (or 50, or 200) new beliefs are all voting together every day, through imagined scenes, revised memories, inner conversations, scripted affirmations that feel true, you no longer have internal contradiction.

Now when you say “I am a millionaire,” the subconscious jury goes:

“Well of course you are! look at all the evidence we’ve been collecting for the past year. Motion carried.”

==================================

Before I end this post, I wanted to give you more options of some low-resistance “small” manifestation exercises that you can use to build your faith.  The idea is to play and have fun, so that when you are under a time crunch, you have already proved to yourself the basics and you already have the supporting beliefs to be able to help you. 

1. **The “Today Only” Game** (easiest possible start) Every morning say: “Today surprises me in small, pleasant ways.” That’s it. Don’t specify. Then forget about it. You might get free upgrades, random compliments, unexpected messages, finding money, perfect timing, etc.
2. **The Random Object Game** Pick something you’ve literally never noticed before:
   * A blue butterfly
   * A red balloon
   * License plate with “777”
   * A white feather Say once: “I’ll see a \_\_\_ today or tomorrow.” Then drop it. 
3. **The Compliment / Smile Game** Morning intention: “At least two people smile at me or compliment me today.” (You can raise the number as it gets easy.) Watch strangers, cashiers, co-workers suddenly become friendly.
4. **The Money-Finding Game** Once a day say: “I now receive unexpected money in fun ways.” Then look forward to finding coins, getting overpaid change, random refunds, someone shouting you lunch, Venmo from years ago, etc. Start seeing $5–$50 pops as normal.
5. **The Revision Lite**  At night, take one tiny annoying thing from the day (traffic jam, rude comment, spilled coffee) and replay it in imagination the way you wished it went. Feel relief. Fall asleep in the new version. You might notice the next day feels lighter and similar annoyances start disappearing.

Don't forget that every time you get a success, write it down in a notebook or Google Docs or something because every time you are feeling doubtful, you can use this list to give you confidence again.  It's your proof.   Experience is 10000% better than reading any success story.    Once you have 50 to 100 under your belt, all doubts and lack of faith starts to crumble, manifestation gets easier and quicker..  And it only gets better and better.. 

Play with time manifestations, play with specific big & small - find your limits, and then get rid of them !

Ok - I am finally done. ",4,1764981424.0,lawofassumption,0,1.0,False

1pfblzr,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/1pfblzr/poor_experience_with_3dmats_maxpider_elegant/,Poor experience with 3DMats Maxpider Elegant floor mats so far,"***TLDR:*** *3DMats Maxpider Elegant floor mats arrived unable to lie flat and flush. Only available option is to leave them outside when sunny and warm to see if they flatten after that. There are no advance replacement processes in place and 3DMats only offers exchanges if the product is in ""good enough condition to resell"".*

Just wanted to share my experience thus far given how popular the 3dMats Maxpider lineup for floor mats are. I recently ordered a set of Elegant mats (their premium carpeted version) as I was tired of my current Taptes looking ashy any time I so much as stepped on them. Here is what I have been going through.

Things started out on the wrong foot due to Fedex incompetence and I was only able to get them 4 days later after originally intended. Box arrived with some small rips but overall still box shaped.

When I took out the mats, I immediately noticed that the big rear piece (folded for delivery) would not lie flat on the ground. Best way to describe it is like if you put plastic film on the ground and there are air bubbles. Front 2 were mostly OK, but when I put them into the driver and front passenger side, there were a few areas that were not flush to the ground as well. No problem, turned on the bottom heater on the Tesla to shoot warm air at the floor and parked my hare fat feet on each area for 10-15 minutes. They seem mostly OK now.

Since there is no easy way to do the same for the large back piece (AC vent in the back is in the middle) I settled with lying the mat flat on my coffee table and setting heavy objects in the affected areas which were all over the place. Fast forward 3 days later, those areas are still not flat and immediately pop up when said heavy objects are removed. At this point, I contacted 3DMats and this is where the experience somehow gets even worse.

Since the mats are fairly large and therefore frustrating to pack back up and return for either a refund or exchange, I decided to call them first to see what I could do to possibly fix the bowing. A few minutes later, I was speaking with their Assistant Product Specialist (actual Product Specialist was out to attend a ""custom fitting""). I will call them APS for short. Their solution was to leave it out in the sun for a few minutes to see if that flattens out the mat. Makes sense, problem is that it forecasts in my area currently to continue being cold and raining next week. APS agrees that won't work, so I ask if I can point a heater, hair dryer, or heat gun at it. Answer is no, it could warp it or burn the ""spider hairs"" on them.

At this point, I was feeling pretty helpless. Being an idiot, I had already given my current previous Taptes mats away as my coworker recently purchased a Tesla as well and I was working from home this week. So, I asked about the RMA/exchange process since the mats are advertised to be a perfect fit and there is supposedly a 3 year warranty process on them. This is when the experience gets much, much worse.

So to start off, because 3DMats only offers the Elegant line as a set you cannot exchange a single defective piece. It's all 3 pieces or nothing, even if the other pieces are good. Secondly, there is no advanced replacement process even when I offered to put a hold on my CC. This means I need to buy a placeholder set of mats from Amazon which I may just do at this point. Then came the real kick to the proverbial balls; they will only do an exchange if the mats are in a condition where they can resell it. So, I am like wait a minute... what good is a 3 year warranty if it doesn't matter if the floor mat is not in a condition where it can be resold? Are we expecting any mats that qualify for that under even a year?

At this point, I ask the APS... ""This is like if Tesla refuses to service a battery because the seats are worn. Does that sound right to you?"" They laugh helplessly and couldn't say anything, so I ask a follow-up ""What IS covered by the warranty?"". The APS answers ""Anything that falls on us."" to which I respond with ""Like?"" This resulted in the typical company response ""Defects from the manufacturer, like tears."" At this, I then asked ""Like the ones you are telling me invalidates an exchange?"" Again, no proper response. Getting no where, I asked if the ""perfect fit liner"" not staying flat constitutes as a defect and the answer was ""No, because we know if you leave it out in the sun it can flatten out.""

So, at this point my only options are to take the front ones out of my car out of fear of invalidating their exchange qualification, order placeholder mats from Amazon, wait until the weather becomes sunny and warm and leave them outside for 5-7 minutes, and then see if that helps, if it doesn't submit a exchange request and hope they are still in good enough condition to qualify. Yeah... I am never recommending a 3DMats product again!",1,1764981354.0,TeslaLounge,0,1.0,False
1pfblvr,https://www.reddit.com/r/ParisTravelGuide/comments/1pfblvr/trip_report_58th_of_november_and_1819th_of/,Trip Report - 5-8th of November and 18-19th of November.,"Belated trip report. The Short version. Paris was fantastic!

For the 5-8th of November we stayed at the [Solly Hotel ](https://en.sollyhotel.com/?gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=20354591486&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI6urFqtOnkQMVrB-DAx1-9B7qEAAYASAAEgK5EvD_BwE)which is pretty much on the border of the 2nd and 3rd arrondissement. It is a nice, boutique hotel that was a good base for exploring Paris being close to the subway and bus. 

**Day 1:** 

Got into CDG about 7:30am met out driver (we already booked via the hotel). We did not realise it was going to be a 1 1/12 hour trip into Paris itself so be warned. 

We got to hotel and the room was ready so dropped out bas and headed out. The first thing we did was get on the Hop on/Hop off bus. This was a great way to see the city and help give us some perspective of where everything is. We eventually got off at Notre Dame after one circuit for some lunch and also to visit **Shakespeare and Co** (which if you know, you know you got to visit). We then wandered around **Notre Dame** (we did not go inside) and then the first Metro trip back to the Hotel.

For dinner, we went to [Aux Crus de Bourgogne](https://auxcrusdebourgogne.com). The food and wine was fantastic and the service was amazing. I think this is where my now fascination with Burgundy wines started. 

**Day 2:** 

Out bus ticket also entitled us to a river cruise. So was caught the Metro to near the **Eiffel Tower**. The metro was very crowded and we had a crash course in Metro etiquette. We had time to kill so had breakfast at [Cafe Caillou](https://www.cafecaillou.com/home-en). Then a lovely stroll through the park to Eiffel Tower and then the cruise. 

The cruise was nice enough and had a good commentary on the history of Paris as we passed various important buildings. Afterwards we walked along the Siene to the **Musee D’Orsay**. A nice walk even with some light rain. However the rain did start to become heavier so we stopped at [Cafe Concorde](https://cafeconcorde.fr). A pleasant enough place to share a bottle of wine waiting for the rain to stop. 

There was only a small queue at the Musee D’Orsay so easy enough to get in. It is well worth the visit. No spoilers but there is some amazing art on display. 

Dinner that night was at [Bistro Giselle](https://www.bistrotgisele.com/en). Small but busy local restaurant again with great food and service. 

**Day 3:** 

We set out for the **Pantheon.** As we had time to spare we had breakfast at [La Creperie](https://www.facebook.com/lacreperiesoufflot/) and then explored **Jardin du Luxembourg**.

We then visited the Pantheon which was stunning. I think the Pantheon is sometimes overlooked but it is very much worth visiting. 

After some shopping in the Latin Quarter and a little rest, it was time for Napoleon Food Tour through Le Marais run by [Mathieu Merci](https://www.matmerci.com)er. This was a fantastic tour and worth every euro. A wonderful combination of food and history focusing on Napolean and Josephine but also the history of **Le Marais.** He helps uncover history that you would not notice just walking around by yourself. And the food and wine at the end was incredbile. We also had one of the best pinot noirs of the trip (and we tried more than a few on our trip) at the wine tasting at the end of the tour. If you can book this I strongly recommend it. 

On the way home we stopped at [MONBLEU Le Comptoir](https://www.monbleu.fr/monbleu-le-comptoir/) for just a little more wine. It is a nice little wine bar in the third arrondissement. Again the staff were friendly and helpful. 

Then it was onto Germany and then back to Paris via Strasbourg, Dijon and Bayeux. 

For our final night in Paris we stayed at the [Maison Albar](https://www.maison-albar-hotels-le-champs-elysees.com/en/) which is very close to the **Arc De Triomphe**. So we ventured out for a close up look at it then afterward we went for a stroll down **Champs-Élysées**. I’m not sure the Champs-Élysées is essential unless you have the cash for high end shopping. 

Next day back to CDG for there trip back home. 

In summary Paris was amazing. The Parisians we met were all friendly and welcoming. The food and wine were incredible. And you will do a lot of walking even though the buses and metro are easy to navigate (the larger train stations can be confusing).  We did have some issues with using the Navigo card on our iPhones with the Metro. Not sure what the issue was so next time, we may get the physical card.

  
As for dining out, I pretty much used google maps to find something close by and booked online. Regardless of a lack of French, a friendly bonjour when entering did wonders and the staff were always helpful regardless of their lack of English and our lack of French. It always worked out. 

And while we missed out on a few of the usual sights in Paris (saved for next time) we did not try to cram everything in which suited us. It is nice just to sit at a cafe/bistro with some wine and watch Paris roll on by. 

  
The only issue I had was being used to Australian coffee culture where I can get a long black at 6:30am as opposed to the Parisian 8am-9am cafe opening times. But adjustments were made. 

We shall return.

 It was so terribly cold. Snow was falling, and it was almost dark, when out of the blue, my wife called me at work. ""We're going to Niagara Falls for the weekend. I got us an awesome deal!""

We had both been working at our first ""full-fledged"" jobs for a year and had reached that moment after graduation when you suddenly realize you can't make that impact on the world your student enthusiasm once promised. At first, I just sighed. It was the dead of January, and I had already expended all my energy on a week of inconsequential stress. I just wanted to collapse on the couch for two days. Sarah felt a similar weary exhaustion. I could tell. Her tone was more hopeful than excited, but she had dreaded the routine we were sinking into and was trying her best to pull us free.

I looked to the ceiling and adjusted my telephone headset. At that time I was working at Stats Canada on the tele-query desk. I took a deep breath and, as convincingly as possible, said, ""Sounds good."" I don't think she bought it, but we went nonetheless.

This was Niagara Falls before the casinos when there was a very distinct off-season. When we got to the hotel, we were given the details of our ""lovers' special"". One dinner to be used either Friday or Saturday, two breakfasts, a roll of tokens for the arcade, 10% off some ""4D"" movie ride experience, and a 2-for-1 coupon to Max Tussaud's. I guessed it was Madame's nephew? We also got a bottle of sparkling wine in our room and chocolate treats on our pillows. I was impressed. It sounded good.

When we got into our room and saw the ""bottle"" of wine - basically an aeroplane-sized glass and half - and the chocolates - ""fun wrapped"" Oh Henry's left over from Halloween - we both started to laugh. The tone for two wonderful days had been set. We decided to cash in on our dinner coupon right away.

The restaurant off the lobby had hopes of being better. There were huge panoramic windows that promised a view of the gorge. Unfortunately, they had some winter moisture problems that day, and it felt like we were defrosting amid the dripping streaks and foggy patches. The decor was your standard booths and tables though the ""romantic"" lighting was unique. Dollar store battery-powered tea lights were lodged inside thick tumbler glasses and shed a muted pleasantness in a ""what a great idea for a craft"" sort of way. I had a feeling they were created by our waitress since she was the one who always seemed to be fussing with them. Only one other couple was in the dining room, so she attended to us immediately.

""Can I get you something to start?""

""Sure."" ""Thank you, that would be nice."" We both responded simultaneously.

""And what would the lady like this evening?""

Sarah smiled at the flattery. ""I think I'll have a glass of white wine."" She glanced over at me to see my reaction. This was a subtle cue of the mood to follow. Diet Coke was usually the beverage of choice. She didn't normally drink alcohol. One glass numbed her nose and made her giggle far too easily. When she did drink, however, it meant she was comfortable with my company and open to anything to follow. I raised my eyebrows in a debonair way.

""And for the gentleman?""

""Do you have Foster's on tap?""

""Yes we do.""

""I'll have a pint please.""

Sarah smiled at the happy memories I invoked. At university, Foster's was my signature beer. It was at a time when Crocodile Dundee was a known name, and Australia was inexplicably cool. 15 cent buffalo wings and a pitcher of Foster's was the Tuesday night special at the London Arms pub. There the Classics Club would meet and, as a group, circle the wagons and drink ourselves into extroverts.

As soon as the waitress left, Sarah smiled at me. She reached out and held my hand across the table. With my gaze on hers, she slipped her foot from her shoe and slowly began sliding it up my pant leg.

""I got a pedicure this morning."" She announced seductively.

I nodded and pretended I didn't notice her invitation. ""What colour?"" I asked.

""I'm not telling."" She teased. ""You'll just have to find out later."" Her devious little smile was gorgeous.

""Mmmm. I can't wait.""

When the waitress returned with our drinks, we immediately retreated to our personal spaces as if we had been discovered by the chaperone. Sarah opened the menu and began to salivate at the variety.

""Can we add an appetizer to the package dinner?"" Her question seemed innocent enough.

""You're on the package?"" Our friendly waitress disappeared, and we were no longer a lady or a gentleman. She ripped the menu out of Sarah's hand and took mine before I had even opened it. She then scurried to her podium and brought back a tattered, grease-stained, photocopied page that we had to share. We both burst out laughing.

The waitress was flustered that we were not as bothered as she was. ""The drinks are NOT included!""

""What choices do we have?"" I asked, expecting the usual chicken or fish. I had been on many packages before with my parents.

""Coffee or tea."" The waitress snapped.

Sarah and I looked at each other in amused disbelief.

""I'll have coffee please."" I didn't even flinch at the ridiculously limited package. I was eager to get my order in early.

""And I'll have the tea!"" Sarah followed my lead. ""Can I have some milk with that?""

""Yes."" The waitress snarled.

""Fantastic!"" I enthused.

""Yes, great! I'm glad we got the package, Honey."" Sarah joked.

The waitress stormed off and returned sometime later with our lettuce-only salads drowned in Kraft's Italian dressing and our chewy chicken dinners, which she had thoughtfully allowed to cool. She tossed the plates on the table and left us to peacefully devour our deal. We didn't see her again until we requested the bill. For some reason, we found it amusing to leave a generous tip, which of course, defeated the purpose of the package, but we didn't care. It was fun.

The rest of the holiday was marred with similar off-season products and services. The wax museum was only half open, so we couldn't see the pop stars of the seventies. I didn't think it was a problem, but Sarah pouted playfully. She really wanted to see young Bowie. Meanwhile, the arcade was particularly stingy about spitting out coupons. So much so that Mike, the scraggly-haired repair guy, ended up escorting us from game to game and repairing the devices on demand. In no time, he was acting like an old drinking buddy. He joked and laughed, then, out of the blue, revealed that working at the Niagara Falls Fun Centre wasn't his career choice, that his dream was to be part of a travelling carnival. He desperately wanted to see more of the world, he explained and socialize with a greater variety of ""wildlife."" Mike winked at Sarah to punctuate his meaning, then began advising her on which games to play.

Sarah was partial to Skee ball and clearly had career potential in the sport, but Mike quickly pointed out that the token-to-coupon payout was not the best. In a furtive whisper, he revealed that The Storm Stopper was your best bet, provided the arcade had left it on its original factory settings. He assured us the ones here were ""cool."" The game had lights that ran around the outside in opposite directions and you had to hit the button at just the right spot to win. It looked impossible, but Mike was right; if you calculated tokens in versus coupons won, it was the best deal. It only took a little practice to win a minor jackpot every 5 or 6 times.

We would cheer each win as if Toronto had won the Stanley Cup. I would give a quick fist pump and a full lung ""Yes!"" while Sarah would jump up and down screaming, ""WhoooHooo!"" Of course, in the end, when we cashed in, ""Mike's secret"" only bumped us up from a key-chain flashlight to a ""deluxe"" nail beauty set. Mind you, it did come complete with clippers, scissors, a file AND a cuticle scraper. Not only that, it was all neatly packaged in a paisley-patterned pink and green plastic vinyl case. Mike was so pleased to give us our prize and to be honest, we were thrilled to win it if only to see his broad chicletted smile. It was more of a trophy than a grooming set.

That night, I made reservations for us at a fancy Chinese food restaurant - the Bamboo Garden. When we arrived, we had half-expected renovations of some sort. Instead, the place was immaculate. Gentle pools teeming with goldfish highlighted the epic black and red Ming dynasty decor. Real candles flickered on crisp white tablecloths. Again, the restaurant was virtually ours. The reservations on my part were entirely unnecessary. In fact, as soon as we entered, they knew us by name and guided us directly to our table. A live lounge piano caressed the air, its notes danced vaguely around familiar harmonies until finally, as if prompted by our presence, a song emerged immediately accompanied by the velvet voice of oriental karaoke. It was our song remastered",1,1764981345.0,Tik_tok_stories,0,1.0,False

1pfblf0,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1pfblf0/sp_a_drop_of_sunshine/,[SP] A Drop of Sunshine,"Fritz's scarred, hairy knuckles rapped on the peeling yellow door. The man who answered had eyes blackened by exhaustion, his plaid shirt hanging loose on a frame that had recently known more weight.

""Can I help you?""

Fritz gripped his faded leather briefcase. ""Morning. Name's Fritz, from Sunny Dreams. I'm here about your inquiry regarding our product. Is this a bad time?""

The man waved him in.

Fritz crossed the threshold. Dust motes floated in the afternoon light. The air smelled stale. The man sank into the sofa, and Fritz noticed curios cluttering the mantle. A photo of a smiling boy between proud parents drew his eye.

""Thank you for seeing me, sir. I take it you're Damon's father?""

The man's head dipped.

""Did you have a chance to read the brochure, or would you like me to explain how Liquid Sunshine works?""

""I read it."" His voice was hoarse.

Fritz scratched the back of his neck, fingers brushing silver hairs. ""Guess that makes my job easier. Do you have any questions, Mr...?""

""Bill."" His voice cracked. ""Can you really dream anything you want?""

""You certainly can."" Fritz placed his briefcase on the coffee table and opened it. A grey ceramic bottle painted with a shining sun was strapped against the lid. ""One drop on the temple, and you can dream anything you want—vividly, safely, for a whole year.""

Bill chewed his cheek, then glanced at the photo. A faint smile tugged at his lips.

Fritz followed his gaze to the picture, then back to Bill. ""Beautiful family.""

Fritz reached for the manila folder at the bottom of his briefcase with a wrinkled hand. ""I have testimonials if you'd like to see them.""

Bill read the papers, his fingers trembling slightly.

""I'll take it. For me and my son, Damon.""

He pulled a green slip from his pocket. A check, already made out to Sunny Dreams for the full amount.

The salesman's fingers hovered over the green paper. ""Shouldn't you discuss this with your son first?""

Bill gestured toward the hallway on the right. ""His door's the one at the end. Only one that's closed."" His voice dropped. ""Talk to him about it. Maybe he wants it too. I don't know how to reach him anymore.""

""This should come from you.""

Bill held Fritz's gaze. His hand drifted toward the photo, stopped halfway. ""Please. I need to see my family happy again.""

Fritz had seen that look before. Some parents went into dreams and never came out. The company never followed up to see how it ended.

The salesman placed the check in his pocket. He unlatched the ceramic bottle from the briefcase lid and uncorked it. Yellow light erupted from the opening and filled the room, warm and liquid.

""What do I need to do?"" Bill's eyes barely focused on the bottle's glow.

""Nothing at all."" Fritz's voice was almost muted. ""I apply it to your temple. You can enter the dream immediately, or wait until you're ready.""

He pressed his forefinger against the bottle's mouth and tilted it. A drop of yellow, viscous liquid gleamed on his fingertip. He hesitated.

""You know, I've heard that people who dream in the same room can enter each other's dreams. Share them.""

Bill said nothing. Fritz opened his mouth to speak, then closed it. The salesman touched Bill's temple. The father's face contorted for just a second. Then his eyes became glassy and placid, staring at something Fritz couldn't see.

Fritz stood in the dim hallway, briefcase in hand, already feeling the weight of what he was about to do. He walked to the closed door at the end and knocked.

""Dad?"" A feeble voice came through the scarred wood.

""No, I'm Fritz. You're Damon, right? I'm from Sunny Dreams. Your father asked me to speak with you. May I come in?""

Silence stretched out. ""Yeah, I'm Damon. You my dad's friend?""

Fritz hesitated. ""Yes.""

More silence. Fritz felt his knuckles strain against the doorframe.

""Okay. Come in."" A pause. ""Can you get my dad?""

Fritz glanced back down the hall. Bill sat on the sofa, staring into nothing, smiling faintly. ""He asked me to talk to you first. If it's a bad time, I can come back.""

""No, it's okay.""

Fritz turned the doorknob.

The room was as dusty as the rest of the house. Medicine bottles crowded the nightstand. The window shade was drawn. The blanket—picturing a cowboy riding a rocket—was faded but clean. Sitting upright against the headboard was a pale, thin boy.

""Is Dad with you?"" Damon's voice carried a tremor.

""No, he asked me to talk to you for a bit. He's fine, though. Just resting.""

""Thank goodness."" The boy smiled weakly. ""He's been real quiet lately. Quieter than usual. All week.""

""Really?""

""Yeah. And I haven't seen Phillip or Greg in a while either. Dad said they'd come over, but they haven't.""

""Well, I guess they'll miss the party."" Fritz sat in a wooden chair beside the bed.

The boy giggled. ""You talk funny.""

""I've been told.""

""What's that?"" Damon nodded at the ceramic bottle.

""A serum. Or a magic potion, depending on who you ask.""

""Yeah, right. You my new nurse? I thought Dad said they stopped coming.""

Fritz looked at the boy's hand kneading the blanket. ""No, I'm not a nurse. I'm a salesman. I sell Liquid Sunshine.""

Damon tilted his head. Fritz unstoppered the bottle. Golden light flooded the room, pushing back the dust and shadows. The sick child reached out. The salesman let him wave his hand above the bottle's mouth without touching it. Yellow light curled around the boy's fingers like warm water.

""That's wild. What's it do?""

Fritz put on his best smile. ""It lets you dream. One drop on your temple and you can create any dream you want. You can be anyone, have anything, go anywhere.""

Damon drummed his thumb against the blanket. ""Could I be Roy Goodson?""

""Roy Goodson—pitcher for the Mets, right? Good choice.""

""Yeah. Could I go hang gliding? Or ride a horse?""

""You could ride a giraffe or an elephant if you wanted.""

""You ever ride a horse?""

He took a breath. ""Once, at an event with an old girlfriend.""

""That must've been amazing.""

""It was for her. I screamed the whole time. Stupid beast went too fast.""

The boy giggled, then coughed. ""I always wanted to. Dad said he'd take me on my next birthday.""

""That'll give you something to look forward to.""

""I haven't been out since forever. Dad said it'd be a while before I could go outside again. I miss it. Haven't thrown a baseball in weeks.""

Fritz raised the bottle slightly. ""With this, you could throw with the best.""

Damon's hand went under his pillow. He drew out a baseball with a faded logo. ""Wanna play catch?""

""Shouldn't throw a ball in the house. You'll break something.""

The boy smirked. ""Chicken?""

Fritz broke into a grin. ""My mama didn't raise a chicken. Toss it.""

They tossed the ball back and forth. Fritz let the ball roll off his fingers. Damon gripped it tight, each throw bringing a small grunt. Both giggled despite the confined space.

""Ever play baseball?"" Damon asked.

""No. Dad couldn't afford the shoes.""

""Got mine from Greg's brother. Been playing since T-ball, up till third grade."" Damon caught the ball and held it. ""Then I had to stop.""

""Couldn't play catch after that?""

""Got too hard. Made me real tired.""

""What about Phillip and Greg?""

""They said it was too boring."" The boy's voice dropped. ""That was about when they stopped coming.""

Silence settled over the room. Damon's nose whistled slightly when he breathed in. Dust drifted through the light.

""You ever think about what you want to be when you grow up?""

""Dad and I used to talk about me being an astronaut, but he doesn't think I'm smart enough. I got As in math, though."" Damon paused. ""I don't really want to be an astronaut anyway. Only said that because it got hard to run to first base.""

He looked sideways at Fritz. ""Did you always want to be a salesman?""

Fritz twirled a silver hair on his chin. ""Can't really say.""

""Is it a secret? You can tell me."" The boy hesitated. ""If you want.""

""When I was your age, I wanted to be a fireman. Those guys looked heroic heading toward a fire. Then I got older and wanted to be a teacher, but..."" He shrugged. ""I never did. Thought kids wouldn't like listening to me.""

He slumped. ""I like listening to you.""

Fritz's mouth flickered upward. ""You do?""

""Yeah. You sound like you'd say interesting things. What'd you want to teach?""

""History. Used to love stories of great people who did great things, even when the world said they shouldn't. Always wished I could meet some of them.""

""Can't that magic potion let you?""

""No. I'd only be talking to the echo of them I've created in my own mind. I want to talk to the real them. Hear what they actually think, not what I imagine they'd say.""

""Maybe you can someday. I bet they'd want to listen to you too.""

Fritz's flickering smile faded. ""No. I'd be listening. They were smarter than I'll ever be.""

""That's why they'd listen. My teacher said really smart people know they don't know everything. So they'd want to learn from you.""

""You might be right. Maybe my old-fashioned earthly wisdom would calm all the brilliant ideas screaming in their heads.""

Damon's eyes brightened slightly, excitement shaking his thin frame. ""It'd be so great to talk like those people. Get people to listen to your ideas. Make the world better.""

Fritz's hands tightened on the bottle. The ceramic was cool against his fingers. ""All of that's within your grasp.""

""No. Have to go to college to be a big thinker. All I can do is listen to big thinkers and their ideas. Don't think it does much, but they seem to like it when people listen.""

He pressed his finger into the cork. ""Liquid Sunshine could make you into a teacher. Or a friend who helps someone with big ideas reach their dreams.""

Damon's cheeks rose. ""You should be my teacher. You could teach me how to be nice to big idea people.""

Fritz swallowed hard as he opened the bottle and pressed his thumb over the top. ""But this stuff—it'll let you see me as your teacher. We could have whole conversations.""

He slid downward on the bed. ""Only with your echo, though.""

He placed some of the serum on his thumb and corked the bottle. ""Don't you want anything? Anything at all. Name it."" His voice caught. ""I'll give it to you.""

Damon stopped sliding. His eyes faced the ceiling. ""Just to talk to you. This was nice.""

""Sure, kid. I enjoyed it too."" Fritz moved his thumb toward the boy's temple. ""Maybe I can stop by again.""

Damon's hand—heavily shaking—pressed against Fritz's wrist. The salesman's thumb hovered inches from the boy's temple. ""Thank you, Mr. Fritz.""

Fritz pulled his hand away and stared at the yellow gleam on his thumb. One touch and the boy would have everything he wanted. Every dream, every wish. A year of perfect happiness before—

He brushed his thumb against the leg of his cream slacks. The yellow shine faded into the fabric. Now it just looked like a small, thick stain.

Fritz corked the bottle and placed it back in his briefcase.

He sat with the boy as the afternoon faded. Damon asked a few questions about history, and Fritz answered as best he could.

At some point, Damon's chest fell and didn't rise again.

Fritz listened to the silence where breath had been. He thought about calling for Bill, but the father was somewhere else now, somewhere his son couldn't follow. Maybe that was better. Maybe one of them should be happy.

He picked up the baseball from where it had rolled under the bed. The leather was soft from years of use, the stitching worn. He set it on the nightstand next to the pills.

Fritz stood, closed the door behind him, and walked back to the living room.

Bill still sat on the sofa, smiling at nothing.

Fritz let himself out. The briefcase felt heavier than when he'd arrived, though the bottle was still full. In his pocket, the check crinkled against his leg with each step.

He didn't look back at the house with the peeling yellow door.

1pfbkfm,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaModel3/comments/1pfbkfm/poor_experience_with_3dmats_maxpider_elegant/,Poor experience with 3DMats Maxpider Elegant floor mats so far,"***TLDR:*** *3DMats Maxpider Elegant floor mats arrived unable to lie flat and flush. Only available option is to leave them outside when sunny and warm to see if they flatten after that. There are no advance replacement processes in place and 3DMats only offers exchanges if the product is in ""good enough condition to resell"".*

Just wanted to share my experience thus far given how popular the 3dMats Maxpider lineup for floor mats are. I recently ordered a set of Elegant mats (their premium carpeted version) as I was tired of my current Taptes looking ashy any time I so much as stepped on them. Here is what I have been going through.

Things started out on the wrong foot due to Fedex incompetence and I was only able to get them 4 days later after originally intended. Box arrived with some small rips but overall still box shaped. 

When I took out the mats, I immediately noticed that the big rear piece (folded for delivery) would not lie flat on the ground. Best way to describe it is like if you put plastic film on the ground and there are air bubbles. Front 2 were mostly OK, but when I put them into the driver and front passenger side, there were a few areas that were not flush to the ground as well. No problem, turned on the bottom heater on the Tesla to shoot warm air at the floor and parked my hare fat feet on each area for 10-15 minutes. They seem mostly OK now. 

Since there is no easy way to do the same for the large back piece (AC vent in the back is in the middle) I settled with lying the mat flat on my coffee table and setting heavy objects in the affected areas which were all over the place. Fast forward 3 days later, those areas are still not flat and immediately pop up when said heavy objects are removed. At this point, I contacted 3DMats and this is where the experience somehow gets even worse. 

Since the mats are fairly large and therefore frustrating to pack back up and return for either a refund or exchange, I decided to call them first to see what I could do to possibly fix the bowing. A few minutes later, I was speaking with their Assistant Product Specialist (actual Product Specialist was out to attend a ""custom fitting""). I will call them APS for short. Their solution was to leave it out in the sun for a few minutes to see if that flattens out the mat. Makes sense, problem is that it forecasts in my area currently to continue being cold and raining next week. APS agrees that won't work, so I ask if I can point a heater, hair dryer, or heat gun at it. Answer is no, it could warp it or burn the ""spider hairs"" on them. 

At this point, I was feeling pretty helpless. Being an idiot, I had already given my current previous Taptes mats away as my coworker recently purchased a Tesla as well and I was working from home this week. So, I asked about the RMA/exchange process since the mats are advertised to be a perfect fit and there is supposedly a 3 year warranty process on them. This is when the experience gets much, much worse.

So to start off, because 3DMats only offers the Elegant line as a set you cannot exchange a single defective piece. It's all 3 pieces or nothing, even if the other pieces are good. Secondly, there is no advanced replacement process even when I offered to put a hold on my CC. This means I need to buy a placeholder set of mats from Amazon which I may just do at this point. Then came the real kick to the proverbial balls; they will only do an exchange if the mats are in a condition where they can resell it. So, I am like wait a minute... what good is a 3 year warranty if it doesn't matter if the floor mat is not in a condition where it can be resold? Are we expecting any mats that qualify for that under even a year? 

At this point, I ask the APS... ""This is like if Tesla refuses to service a battery because the seats are worn. Does that sound right to you?"" They laugh helplessly and couldn't say anything, so I ask a follow-up ""What IS covered by the warranty?"". The APS answers ""Anything that falls on us."" to which I respond with ""Like?"" This resulted in the typical company response ""Defects from the manufacturer, like tears."" At this, I then asked ""Like the ones you are telling me invalidates an exchange?"" Again, no proper response. Getting no where, I asked if the ""perfect fit liner"" not staying flat constitutes as a defect and the answer was ""No, because we know if you leave it out in the sun it can flatten out."" 

So, at this point my only options are to take the front ones out of my car out of fear of invalidating their exchange qualification, order placeholder mats from Amazon, wait until the weather becomes sunny and warm and leave them outside for 5-7 minutes, and then see if that helps, if it doesn't submit a exchange request and hope they are still in good enough condition to qualify. Yeah... I am never recommending a 3DMats product again!",3,1764981233.0,TeslaModel3,0,1.0,False
1pfbhe4,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1pfbhe4/dollimination/,Dollimination,"There are voodoo secrets unknown to society at large, never reaching documentaries or speculative fiction. For example, most laymen rest assured, assuming that since they’ve never met a witch doctor, such a personage couldn’t possibly possess an item personal enough to that layman—hair, toenail, Band-Aid, or whatever—to permit any hexes against them. But in fact, the very best voodoo dolls are produced from self-portraits, a person’s self-image filtered through whatever illustrative skill they possess. 

 

Unfortunately for Bradley Clarke, he learned of that voodoo secret from a haggish Starbucks patron, who took offense when he opted not to sign her outthrust comic book—*The Unspooling* issue eight—which he’d written and illustrated some years prior. In Bradley’s defense, the woman had clumsily bumped his table and toppled his cappuccino, and he was frantically napkin-dabbing his slacks when the comic materialized from the depths of her Burberry backpack. 

 

“I’m a fan of your work,” the woman assured him. Still, he waved her away. He’d been getting recognized often lately; it was annoying. 

 

“Get lost, you old bitch,” he grunted, taking no small measure of joy as he watched her face crumple into a downcast expression, one incongruous with the psychedelic shawl that she wore.

 

Through her tears and livid shaking, the old gal muttered, “No, no, you shouldn’t have. You shouldn’t…you shouldn’t have done it.”

 

“Your parents shouldn’t have spawned you, so go find a bridge to live under,” Bradley countered. “That’s right, I just called you a troll. What can *you* do about it? As a matter of fact, were it up to me, people like you wouldn’t be allowed to read my comics in the first place.”      

 

“People like me? *People like me?* You dare insult hoodooists?”

 

“Hoodooists? Is that what inbred hags call themselves nowadays?” 

 

“Inbred? *Inbred!* What the heck is your problem? I approached you politely, humbly requesting an autograph, and you went and treated me like week-old, diseased spittle. Someone…*somebody* needs to teach you a lesson!” 

 

“Lesson, huh? Talk about lessons after you graduate from kindergarten, ya empty-headed spastic. They should stick you on an island—or better yet, under one.” *Wow, I’m really laying into her, aren’t I?* Bradley thought, delighted. *What’s gotten into me today? Surely, spilled coffee alone can’t shape me into someone this sinister? Have I forgotten something I should be pissed-off about?*     

 

Seemingly shrinking two inches, the elderly lady flung her entire physicality into a quivering tirade, a finger-waving string of invectives. Mangling much conjugation, interspersing four-letter nastiness every five words or so, she explained that thing about voodoo (you know, from this story’s first paragraph).

 

“I have your self portrait!” she added. “You’re sure in for it, buddy!” To better illustrate her assertion, she opened Bradley’s comic and pointed out its protagonist in a succession of images. Bradley hadn’t just been *The Unspooling*’s creator, you see, he’d also been its star, having written the tale about his experiences as he wrote the tale. It was one of those meta sort of pieces, that certain types of people relate to. 

 

Unfortunately for Bradley, those kinds of fans didn’t mesh well with him in public. Frankly, most looked as if they were about to sneeze on him—and sometimes did, for that matter. Often, they’d demand to take a photo with Bradley, even though he hated to be photographed, due to that wart on his cheek that resembled a nipple. Never were they voluptuous groupies, or even related to any.        

 

“Come on, lady,” groaned Bradley. “We both know that voodoo’s not real. You’re only degrading that issue’s value…when it was Very Fine to begin with, tops.”  

 

“I’m gonna curse you, boy! Curse you bad! A real bad curse! Then I’m gonna tell my online hoodooist group all about it! Best believe!”

 

“Online hoodooist group? *Online hoodooist group!* Lady, I thought those Sarah McLachlan animal cruelty videos were the saddest thing I ever saw. Then you came into my life. I tell ya, my soul weeps.” 

 

“Soul?” she yelped. “Soul, sir…your soul is, is…is curdled. In fact, say goodbye to your soul. It’s…muh-muh-mine.” 

 

*Yeah, she looks like she’s gonna sneeze, alright*, Bradley thought.

 

“Mine!” the woman shrieked, before thundering right out of the Starbucks. 

 

“Hers,” Bradley laughed, making his way to the counter to attain a coffee to go. He decided to throw away his slacks the very instant he got home, to better help him forget the encounter.  

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Naturally, forgetting the encounter wasn’t the coffee spiller’s intention. Matilda Grieves was her name. Fuming was her mentality, inundated by recollections of past insults, the sort that had shaped her into a hoodooist to begin with. 

 

Powering on her MacBook, she announced, “I’ll show him, yes, yes. I’ll make every second of every minute of his every day agonized. *The Unspooling* fooled me good. I actually thought Bradley-\*asshole-\*Clarke to be a kindred spirit. Never again, I say. Never, never. That snobby jerk thinks he’s so great. Well, I’ll show him, yes I will.” 

 

With her laptop’s built-in webcam, Matilda recorded a simple how-to video, which she immediately uploaded to her hoodooist group’s website. In the video, she used scissors to cut out a front profile illustration of Bradley Clarke, from *The Unspooling*’s seventh issue, and then a back profile illustration, from *The Unspooling* issue four, of roughly equivalent dimensions. She then traced both onto canvas, cut it carefully, and sewed everything together, stuffed with yarn. Just as simple as that, Bradley had been reproduced in effigy. 

 

In closing, Matilda snarled at the webcam and exhorted, “This comic book bastard mocked us, my sisters. He thinks we’re pathetic, a buncha inbred hags playin’ make-believe. So let’s teach him a lesson—all of us, together, today. Make voodoo dolls of your own, and we’ll hit Mr. Clarke with enough hexes to leave his doomed, bastard head spinnin’.”

 

As dozens of her web chums placed same-day delivery orders, or busily bustled their way to comic book dealers, Matilda took her Bradley doll for a spin. 

 

First, she made the thing do the splits. 

 

And lo and behold, in another part of the city, Bradley found himself plummeting painfully upon his testicles, legs pointed eastward and westward. Shrieking, he rolled onto his side, only to find his left foot flying into his face, over and over. “What’s happening?” he wailed. 

 

“It worked, I can feel it,” Matilda declared, alone in her bedroom. Frankly, the power she felt coursing through her body aroused her sexually. Fantasizing about rubbing the doll against her erogenous zones, she became flush-faced, and had to remind herself that she absolutely hated Bradley Clarke. 

 

Palpitating, she decided to take an especially lengthy cold shower. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

There are voodoo secrets unknown even to most hoodooists. Prime amongst them is the effect that multiple voodoo dolls have on their subject. I mean, how many people are deemed so reprehensible that they garner drastic measures from not just one, but multiple hexers? That percentage is so infinitesimal, it was previously unheard of. 

 

While Matilda showered, the first of her confrères completed her own Bradley doll. The very moment that she finished sewing the thing together, an astounding process commenced. Seated in his kitchen with an icepack on his scrotum, Bradley felt himself being tugged by an invisible force. “Ahhhh!” he hollered, gritting what felt like too many teeth, assailed by a splitting headache. 

 

*I’m exchanging stature for breadth*, he thought, shrinking and widening. Arms sprouted from his neck. His genitals doubled, as did his legs. His vision temporarily dilated, as he fell off of his chair while remaining seated. 

 

Due to an inexplicable binary fission, there were now two Bradley Clarkes, each half the size and weight of the original. Even his clothing—jeans and an Indian Jewelry shirt, the one with the drippy lips—had doubled and shrunk, though the ice pack remained singular. 

 

“What the hell is this?” both Bradleys asked, synchronized. Then, suddenly, the floored Bradley was slapping his own face with alternating palms, whilst the other Bradley watched, quite perplexed. And even as that occurred, flesh began to stream from both his self-slapping and seated selves. Amalgamating, it formed a third Bradley—the same size as those two, who had shrunken. 

 

Reclining, the new Bradley slid up the wall, then back down to the floor, then right back up the wall, even as his flesh streamed to help form a fourth Bradley. 

 

And that’s how it continued. Bradleys contributed mass to new Bradleys. Ceaselessly shrinking, they endured every painful calamity those distant hoodooists saw fit to send over. One’s leg twisted so severely that bone shards poked out in three places; another found himself blinded as both his eyes imploded. A few danced without rhythm, or leapt far higher than they ought to have. Soon, the kitchen was filled with Bradleys, which was when the deaths began. 

 

One Bradley went up in flames; another endured a waterless drowning. Four strangulated themselves purple-faced. A Bradley spun his head off his shoulders while dancing a jig. Another was crumpled into a ball hardly recognizable as human. Replicated shrieks filled the residence, which might have reached the ears of 911-dialing neighbors, were any home from work at the time.  

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Matilda’s hoodooist network was far larger than one might suspect, and the ratio of live Bradleys to dead ones kept increasing. In fact, the process soon prompted the most clandestine of voodoo secrets to manifest. 

 

You see, when a voodoo doll’s subject is shrunken smaller than their effigy, they effectively become their voodoo doll’s doll. Unseen, true musculature blossoms within canvas. Eyes of glossy, illustrated paper become fully functional. Faux fingers flex as functioning digits. 

 

Ergo, even as the hoodooists contorted and mangled their respective dolls, cackling, they were unaware that such actions no longer affected any Bradley. Indeed, abandoning their physicality, each Bradley now bided his time as a spirit existing inside his own effigy. 

 

Each would wait until their hexer was vulnerable—sleeping, reading, or otherwise distracted—and then they’d enact their revenge. They’d gather knifes, razors, knitting needles, and other sharp implements, and assail hoodooist flesh with all proper animus. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

The original Bradley doll trudged toward a bathroom, wherein a showered Matilda was toweling herself dry. Awkwardly, he clutched a pair of scissors, which he’d discovered beneath her living room sofa. 

 

*I’ll give that old bitch her autograph after all*, he thought, grinning paper lips. *I’ll carve it in permanent, and see how she likes it.* ",1,1764981002.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

I drove home with the radio off, half expecting his car to reappear in my rearview mirror. Every streetlight felt like a spotlight. Every shadow felt occupied. By the time I reached my apartment, my shirt was crusted with dried blood, and the bandage I slapped over my cheek wasn’t doing much.



I’ve dealt with violent men before. Abusers, stalkers, addicts having the worst night of their lives. They all have patterns, tiny giveaways that separate the dangerous from the pathetic. This man had none.



He wasn’t panicked.



He wasn’t improvising.



He was prepared.



I poured myself a drink I didn’t need and checked my phone. Three missed calls. One voicemail.



Marissa.



I let it sit for an hour before I listened to it. I don’t know why. Maybe part of me hoped the job would disappear if I ignored it long enough.



When I finally pressed play, her voice cracked straight through.



“Did you find anything?” she asked. No greeting. No hesitation. Her voice was different. Tight, like she’d been crying but didn’t have the luxury to finish.



“I just… I need to know if I’m crazy.”



Crazy? No. If anything, she was the sanest person in this entire situation.



I didn’t call her back. Not yet. I needed distance. Perspective. A plan.



But at 3:12 a.m., my phone buzzed again.



Not a call.



A text message.



From an unknown number.



Unknown:

Good evening, Alex. How’s the cheek?



My throat closed.



Another message arrived before I could finish reading the first.



Unknown:

Don’t make this me against you. I’m not your enemy. You’re lucky. I like your skillset. Consider this a… recruitment**.**



Recruitment.



The word made something deep inside me recoil.



A third message popped up.



Unknown:

Meet tomorrow. Noon. Same coffee shop. Sit where you sat with my wife. Don’t be late.



I stared at the phone for a long time, pulse pounding loud enough to hear. There was no question how he got my number. He’d planned for everything. He didn’t just anticipate someone following him. He’d prepared for it.



I didn’t sleep. I just watched the night melt into morning while my cheek throbbed like a reminder carved into my face.



At 11:58 a.m., I walked into the coffee shop. Same bell. Same smell of burnt espresso and old books. The same barista who didn’t recognize me, which somehow made this feel even more surreal.



He was already there.



Sitting in the same booth Marissa had sat in, like he’d swapped seats in some twisted game of musical chairs. His posture was immaculate. Relaxed. Polished. Like he belonged here and I didn’t.



“Alex” he said, smiling like we were old friends.



There was no knife this time.



That somehow scared me more.



I sat.



He slid a folder across the table.



Thin. My name written on the tab.



“Before you open it” he said softly, “let’s establish two things.”



He held up one finger.



“One: If I wanted you dead, we wouldn’t be speaking right now.”



A second finger.



“Two: You’re not here because you followed me. You’re here because I let you.”



My pulse spiked.



He nodded at the folder. “Go ahead.”



I hesitated, then opened it.



My address.



Photos of my car.



A copy of my PI license.



A picture of me at my sister’s house two weeks ago, from an angle that meant he’d been close.



Too close.



He watched me process it, his expression calm and analytical, like he was studying how I reacted to fear.



“You’re a spectator, Alex” he said. “You spend your life documenting other people’s secrets. That’s what makes you useful. That’s what makes you interesting.”



His voice lowered, almost conversational.



“But sooner or later, every spectator has to choose a side.”



He leaned forward. I didn’t move.



“Tell me, Alex… did you hear the music last night?”



My mouth went dry. I didn’t answer.



His smile widened, not friendly, not warm. Pleased**.**



“You think you heard a victim” he whispered. “But you didn’t. You heard a transformation.”



A chill slid down my spine.



“What do you mean?”



He sat back, humming that same classical melody under his breath. The same one from the storage unit. The same one he’d embedded into my dreams all night.



When he spoke again, it was barely audible.



“You’re going to help me pick the next one.”



My heart stopped.



“The next what?”



He didn’t blink.



“The next volunteer.”

Hey everyone. I am putting myself out there to meet new people and hopefully build some easy, genuine connections. I am mainly looking for friendship to start. Good conversations, shared interests, someone to laugh with and feel comfortable around. If things naturally grow into something more, I am definitely open to that as well.

A little about me:
I am 33, born and raised in Michigan. I enjoy anything outdoors during the warmer months. Hiking, kayaking, camping, random day trips, bonfires, and pretty much anything that gets me outside. Once winter arrives, I switch into a more relaxed, at home mode. I enjoy reading, watching good shows, drinking coffee, and just enjoying calm nights in with the right person.

Personality wise, I am friendly, laid back, and easy to talk to. Once I am comfortable with someone, I can be silly, sarcastic, and playful. I love to laugh and I enjoy people who do the same. I appreciate genuine and consistent communication without anything forced or awkward. Just two people getting to know each other at their own pace.

What I am hoping to find:
Someone who wants to talk, share stories, joke around, and build something real. Whether it becomes a solid friendship or turns into something deeper, I am open to either.

My schedule is a beautiful mix of controlled chaos and glorious freedom.

I really enjoy the simple things: getting a coffee and walking around the city, checking out a new movie, or wandering through local events. We definitely live in a great city for things like that. I'm definitely open to trying new things and would love to hear what you're passionate about.

What I'm looking for is easy-going and genuine. Someone to talk with about anything and everything, sharing stories, learning from each other, and just enjoying good company. I'm not just looking for a text buddy; I actually want to meet up and hang out in the real world.

If you're a woman who values connection, good conversation, and friendship, I'd love to hear from you. Age and race don't matter to me, though being in a similar age range might mean we have a bit more in common.

I just recently got diagnosed with ADHD. My first day on Ritlain felt somewhat promising, but I was only given 10mg once in the morning.

Back in high school (2022) I messed around with Addorol being dumb, and honestly that was the first time I ever felt clear headed, calm, and actually normal. The difference now is crazy. With Ritlain I get a tiny burst of energy but then I end up hyperfocusing on the wrong stuff. It lasts maybe 3 hours and then I get super sleepy.

I’m embarrassed to admit this, but I’ve been increasing my dose on my own because I’ve been drowning in schoolwork and finals. I haven’t been able to get anything done all week. I’m not trying to misuse anything, I just panicked and started taking 2–3 when it wore off. My ADHD paralysis is really bad and I feel ashamed of the basic things I struggle to do.

There’s honestly no way 10mg once a day is enough for me. My daily coffee used to do more than this. Ritlain wears off so fast — one of my classes alone is two hours. I work, I study, I have responsibilities. I feel like my ADHD has wrecked a lot of my life. I’m 20 and I want to fix things, but simple tasks feel impossible. I thought getting diagnosed and starting meds would be the turning point. Instead I feel defeated because the meds aren’t working and now I’m scared it means something is wrong with me.

I don’t know what to do. Should I message my psychiatrist to adjust the dose? Ask about switching meds? I don’t want to seem like I’m chasing stronger meds — I just genuinely want to function.

1pfb3ol,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/1pfb3ol/the_sunday_paper_ritual/,The Sunday Paper Ritual,"The Sunday newspaper has had some importance in my adult life. 

Never used to care much about it when I was a kid, except for the funnies and the weekly TV guide, but as an adult, I have come to understand the importance in a man's life of getting up when he pleases on Sunday, having a nice cuppa, and perusing the morning paper. It's the only time in the week I can do this at leisure, and consequently, it has a certain gravity to it

I first started doing it when I lived in an apartment around the corner from a 7-11. Their coffee was better than mine, anyway, so I'd just shrug into a bathrobe, slip on a pair of thong sandals, light a cigarette, and wander the fifteen yards or so from my front door to the front of the store. I'd walk in, draw a cup of coffee, pick up a paper, pay for it all -- still in bathrobe and sandals -- and walk back to my apartment, and be sitting and reading the paper in my own recliner before my cigarette was done.

I particularly enjoyed this after the clerk got over the idea that I was going to wander in fresh out of bed every weekend, and it became normal to her. She worked the early shift every Sunday. That entire summer, I'd wander in, get my coffee and Sunday paper, pay for it, and leave, and neither she nor I acted as if this was in any way strange.

The effect this had on the other customers was great. I still remember it fondly.

On one occasion, as I was leaving the 7-11, my attire drew the attention of a police officer, who asked if I was in any kind of trouble or emergency; when I told him no, he asked me for ID. I told him I had none with me, but that he was welcome to accompany me home, and I would show him my driver's license.

He asked, ""Do you live near here?""

""Do you think I walked very far, dressed like this?""

""And you walked here dressed like that... why?""

""Because I wanted my coffee and paper before I took a shower?""

""And you see nothing wrong with being out in public dressed like this?""

""Sign on the door says I have to have shoes and a shirt on. Says nothing about pants. Why, am I showing off something I shouldn't?"" I glanced down; robe hung to my knees, same as always. No peekaboo. Legal as taxes.

He decided I was no drunker or crazier than the guy at the counter trying to buy beer at nine in the morning on a Sunday, and that he didn't need to see my ID; plainly, a man with a cuppa coffee in one hand and his Sunday paper in the other couldn't be THAT much of a threat to society... bathrobe or not. 

Nice, reasonable cop, out doing his job. Should be more cops like him.

I do miss the Sunday paper ritual.",1,1764979943.0,CasualConversation,4,0.6,False

1pfb1sj,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1pfb1sj/norwegian_roadtrip_via_motorbike/,Norwegian Roadtrip via Motorbike,"Hi all! I wanted to share a recent trip taken while we were in Norway. We decided to plan an escape with the criteria of something adventurous, scenic, and somewhere my local friend had never been. We landed on a three day motorbike trip through the Norwegian mountainous region of Jotunheimen. It was an amazing experience, and I thought I would share parts of our itinerary that stood out and made our trip so special.

We started in Nes, and headed north towards Aurdal. On the way, there were so many roadside bakeries, farm shops, and local artisans selling smoked fish, jams, and other road trip provisions. Make sure to stock up to support local businesses, we also loved the skolebrød, a traditional cardamom bun filled with custard, and topped with icing and coconut. So good!

We took the Valdresflye Scenic Route, which offered amazing and surreal views of lakes and peaks, situated 1,400 meters above sea level. Make sure to look into the Leirvassbu Tourist Cabin, which is one of the only guest houses in the Jotunheimen Mountains. It is part of Norway's DNT tourist cabin network, which is definitely something to look into if spending an extended amount of time in Norway! This network is built on the ideals of nature being welcoming. They offer clean rooms, a dining hall, and communal lounge areas as well.

We then completed the Kyrkja Hike, which I will say, was very intense. Allow yourself 5-6 hours for this hike, and pack as if the weather will turn on you, because it might! It is a steep up and down climb, but the summit reward makes up for the intensity. You will likely be wiped after this hike, which is the perfect excuse for another night in the cozy cabin.

On our way home, we crossed through Sognefjellet Pass, which is the highest mountain road in northern Europe. It is breathtaking, and truly feels like another planet. It’s the kind of road that makes you pull over just to stare. Make sure to stop by Sognefjellet Lodge for some coffee and provisions to warm up and take in the views.

Fagernes is the unofficial capital of Valdres and has amazing smoked fish, sausages, trout fishing, and the legendary Norsk Rakfiskfestival (a sour-fish celebration that draws 20,000 visitors every November). This was a great final stop on our mountain trip.

What I loved most about exploring Norway was how the country doesn’t mess with nature, it elevates it by stepping out of the way. It’s like the entire country is designed for the intuitive traveler. There are no billboards, blinking lights, or ""Last Exit Ahead\*""\* signs. Trails aren’t over-marked. We had a lovely vacation, and would highly recommend to anyone even considering exploring Norway. If you have any questions, would be happy to help!",2,1764979804.0,travel,0,0.75,False

“What do you mean, you ran out of gas?” Kayla asks, Totally confused. “Dad never goes below half a tank. Why didn’t you just walk to the house?”

“Please don’t call our parents officer! We weren’t doing anything illegal.” Amy pleads. 

Kayla is totally confused at this point and just shakes her head. “Tom and I are going to the house. Please put your clothes on before coming inside. I’m going to have a hard time explaining this to my therapist, let alone Tom! You two need to grow up and get a room!” She spins around and gets in Tom’s car. 

At this point Dan and Amy loose it. They laugh and cuddle.  

“Why didn’t you walk to the house?” Amy says, imitating Kayla’s exasperation. 

“Please don’t call our parents officer!” Dan pipes up, gasping for breath, from laughing so hard. 

“You two need to grow up and get a room!”  

“Looks like I’m going to have to talk to Kayla about this. It sounds like she was truly upset. I thought my days of having sex talks with my kids were over.” Dan says with a sigh.

They get their clothes found and put on. Still giggling and on the post sex high.  They pull in the garage, hesitant for the potential backlash. 

They walk into the kitchen and hear Kayla laughing and saying;

“Please don’t call our parents officer. We didn’t do anything thing illegal!” Doing her best Amy imitation. Tom and her laughing uncontrollably. 

“I don’t sound like that, Miss grow up and get a room!” Amy responds. 

“Tom explained the whole teenager and car sex thing to me! I never knew!” Kayla says as she hugs Dan and Amy. “You two do know how to keep it interesting!”

“I have more stories I can tell!”
Amy teases. 

“No! My boyfriend doesn’t need any ideas.” Kayla blurts out. 

Dan spins and looks at Tom. “Do you know what you’re getting yourself self into?” 

Tom smiles. “No, but I don’t think it’s going to be boring.”

XOXOXOXO 

It’s 6:30 Monday morning and the alarm goes off. Dan gets up and shuts off the alarm, then goes and starts the coffee. He comes back into the bedroom and Amy hasn’t moved. He slides back in bed with her. 

“Baby Girl what a weekend. It was great to see family. A little sex. Go to a wedding, more sex. Get home a lot more sex.” Dan says trying to get a raise out of Amy. 

“A great weekend and leave on Wednesday for vacation.”

“So do you know how to tell if it was a great wedding?”

Amy knows there is a Dad joke coming.  “No, how?”

“Even the cake is in tiers!”

Amy has to laugh at that one. “Alright, that is a good one Daddy.” 

“Get in the shower.  I’ll get the coffee.” 

Dan gets the coffee while Amy heads into the bathroom.  When he gets back to the bedroom, he pulls out the package Frosty had given him. It contained 2 framed pictures.  One of Amy and Deb and one of Amy and Frosty. Dan set them on the dresser and took the coffees into the bathroom. 

“Half a day in the office today, then home to unpack. Have Frosty here for supper tonight then pack for vacation tomorrow!” Dan says handing Amy her coffee. 

They sip on the coffee and let the shower bring them to life. 

“We need to buy steaks for supper and a few other things before we come home after lunch. Frosty and Wyatt meeting up this afternoon?” Amy asks. 

“They are meeting up when Frosty gets here. We will iron out any details after dinner.” 

“We have a plan then partner!”

Dan sets the the coffees on the counter. Then he starts to help Amy get soapy. 

“Unfortunately there is only room for one in the cruise ships shower. So we will have to move to the tub.”

“Well that’s a design flaw, but we will figure something out.” Amy says with a giggle.  

Dan hurries up and heads out to do chores. Amy lingers a little longer in the shower. When she finishes, she puts on one of the fluffy robes. Her stomach was a little queasy. She needed a little food. She goes out of the bathroom to her dresser and spies the two pictures. She stops and smiles. Her man had gone behind her back to get those two pictures. All she could think was;

‘He made an effort.’

Her heart swelled. This man of hers was a definite keeper. Now how to thank him. She went and made some toast and formulated a plan to thank him. 

Returning to the bedroom she slips on a sexy black thong. Then a pair of black thigh highs, because they were Dan’s favorite. Along with sexy black pumps. Ran a brush through her hair and put on a bright red lipstick. Put her robe back on and started breakfast. Even though she knew it would be cold by the time she got done with Dan. 

Breakfast was just about done when Amy heard him coming in. She threw the robe behind the island and was standing in front of the stove in full view, when Dan walked in. 

“Amy dear, I was just thinking……. Holy fuck.” 

Amy smiled. She knew all the air had went out of Dan’s lungs.  A sexy gut punch. 

“You were thinking what?” Amy asks coyly.  

Dan stammers. She had left her man, who is never at a loss for words speechless. She was very proud of herself. 

“I saw the present you left on the dresser for me, Daddy. So I made you a special breakfast.”

Amy says, as she walks over to Dan. She squats down and unzips his Wranglers to release his throbbing manhood. kissing the tip.  Instantly a drop of precum forms. Then sucks the mushroom head into her mouth and teases the tip with her tongue. Leaving a lipstick ring around his cock. This unleashes a stream of profanity. A finger finds its way to tease his backside. 

“Follow me.” Amy orders. 

Amy stands up and walks to the bedroom. Dan says nothing, following behind. 

“Strip mister.”

Complying instantly, the clothes are shed. Amy turns around and slides off her thong. 

“Oh shit, fuck!”

Dan’s inability to form sentences only encourages Amy. She walks up and tightly ties the thong around his balls and cock. Trapping the blood in his engorged cock. Then crawls onto the bed. Spreading her legs, then taking two fingers and spreading her kitty open. 

“Please fuck me Daddy.”

An evil smile spread across his face. No kissing, the foreplay was over. In one stroke he buried himself into her valley, then began thrusting. This was beyond passionate. It was animalistic.  Within a minute Amy could feel her orgasm building deep inside. 

“Don’t stop! Oh fuck me!”

Those words fueled Dan’s desires as he thrust harder.

“Harder Daddy!” 

Wrapping her legs around him, their bodies forming one unit. Her orgasm hit, but the pounding continued. Then another. At this point Amy is lost in the pleasure, her mind blanking out.  Another O washed over her as she feels Dan exploding inside her.

“Oh fuck, Babygirl!” 

A couple more half hearted thrusts and Dan rolls off of Amy.  They lay there, side by side. Spent.  Amy grabs his hand and holds it.  Amy suffers another aftershock and Dan rolls over and holds her. They kiss lightly. Amy starts to giggle. 

“I don’t know if I would survive thanking you for a new stove!”

I am happy in my relationship while they are on the verge of ending their relationship. There’s such an intense bodily, chemical reaction of mutual attraction. Neither of us have acted on or said anything but it’s just there and it’s undeniable. We spend a fair amount of time together outside of work (we’re coworkers), mainly in public spaces—coffees, gym, walks, what have you. Now, my partner has raised some concerns. Many concerns about my LO. We’ve been in therapy trying to resolve some issues surrounding my friend.

This week was a heavy LO week. It was their birthday so I spent more time than usual with them outside of work. Some one-on-one, some with us four as couples. Well, today I could feel vibes BIG time from them. And I could tell they were kind of annoyed or put off when I mentioned my partner (this has never happened before). Anyways, I started having very icky feelings of guilt, shame, regret. Intense longing for my partner. I just wanted to escape the situation. 

Now I want to start pulling back but I’m worried that if they do end up breaking up with their partner that they’ll need a lot of emotional support from me. Granted this is a wonderful person. Someone I would call a close friend. I want to be a friend to them. And if I feel like if I pull back too far too fast it could really hurt them. But I also just need some space and distance to let this flame kind of burn down a bit. Idk if I’m looking for advice or just putting my thoughts into the ether.

**Dec 5, 2025: Belle’s (Alternate) Pick of the Day 🏒**

\-SJ Sharks v DAL Stars Over 6.0 (-115) | 0.5 Units

**Why This Pick?**

I can’t quite pinpoint why, but this is one of my favourite matchups in Hockey. One team is infinitely better than the other, but San Jose has kept some close games with Dallas over the last couple years. That said, the Over has cashed in 4 of their last 5 matchups, and the Stars should have no issue bagging goals this evening. Take the Over to hit.

I grew up in one of those families where like… nothing was ever celebrated? You get an A? “Ok cool.” Birthday? “Congrats on aging I guess.” So now as an adult I kinda suck at recognizing anything good in my own life.

My therapist told me to start writing down “small wins” so I actually notice them instead of just brushing them off. So I bought this cheap notebook and I just jot stuff down in it at night. Literally like “Went to the gym even tho I wanted to rot in bed” or “Didn’t snap during a stressful meeting.” Stuff like that. It actually helps.

My girlfriend (28F) saw me writing in it one night and asked what it was. I told her and she thought it was sweet at first. But over the last month she’s gotten weird about it. Like she’ll see me write something down after we hang out and she’ll be like “Are you grading our time together?” Or she’ll joke-but-not-really-joke that she doesn’t wanna “end up in the notebook” in a bad way.

I keep telling her it’s literally not about her. I don’t write anything about her unless it’s positive like “gf surprised me with coffee, made my day,” that kinda thing. She said that STILL makes her feel judged because she thinks if I don’t write something after we hang out, it means she didn’t do anything “notebook worthy.” (Which is not how it works at all lol.)

She finally told me she wants me to stop writing in it because it “makes her feel watched.” I offered to keep it in my backpack and just write in it at work or in my car. She said that feels like I’m sneaking around and “keeping secrets.”

I kinda feel like I’m losing my mind here because it’s literally just a dumb notebook helping me fix my brain a little. It’s not a relationship scoreboard. I’m not hiding anything. It’s not even about her 90% of the time.

She says if I keep doing it, it means I’m choosing the notebook over her emotional comfort..

Tldr: I keep a “wins notebook” to help my mental health. GF says it makes her feel judged and wants me to stop entirely. I don’t want to. AITA?",441,1764978577.0,AmItheAsshole,289,0.94,False

Every day since I have started taking it has been great, No D no matter what I ate. No cramps or spasms.

Today I got cocky, had my coffee and almond milk in the morning. A couple of hours later drank the cholestyramine and about 30 min later had the greasiest slice of bacon ever. 

This would normally send me in the bathroom immediately and I was hoping this time it wont but it did. 10 min later I was in the bathroom with the greasiest D I have ever had 😭.

So now I wonder is it that I have too much bile or not enough bile that is causing my D, or maybe its not BAM at all?

Ever since buying them I’ve noticed a definite increase in difficulty with the operators I’m running into and much better loot on the teams I wipe. Also, the loot I’m finding is much better, even besides the card rooms. This round is probably the most I’ve found in an easy round, possibly in any round.

I moved to Charlottesville, VA this past summer for a job opportunity and while I love my job and the area, I recently found out that after I get my master's degree, there won't be any opportunity to get paid more at my current job. Charlottesville is just so expensive and I would love to be able to have my own apartment again without a roommate. I also assumed Charlottesville would be semi-affordable since it's a college town, but I don't know how any college student is affording to live here. I've had some people tell me to look into Philadelphia or Baltimore, and obviously wherever I move to will depend on wherever I get a job at, but where are some places I should start looking? I graduate this July. 

For reference I am from a small beach town in the south and miss the beach more than I thought I would. I would love to move back to a beach town someday, but I know how expensive they can be. This is also my first winter and while I'm enjoying it, I know Virginia winter is probably more mild than the Midwest or New England. I do not like hiking and that seems to be a lot of what people do here. I prefer going out places like to museums or coffee shops, etc. I also really like that Charlottesville is a mid-sized college town, close to other cities and has Amtrak service, especially to places like DC or Baltimore. Someone told me that Champaign, IL is comparable, but idk where I should be looking to move? I'm also expecting to be making between 60k-70k after graduate starting out, if that helps.

1pfah2l,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1pfah2l/aio_i_think_my_new_supervisor_is_on_a_power_trip/,AIO I think my new supervisor is on a power trip.,"For context this new supervisor started shortly after I did. I technically have more experience than she does but I was working a different department at the time so she (30f) got promoted to supervisor when I (35f) got bumped to full time and moved to her department.

Well, ever since her official promotion got approved I feel like she's been nitpicking literally everything I do.

I'll clean the coffee maker and she'll complain that I cleaned it too soon, and now the cycle is thrown off (by 30 minutes).

The phone will ring and I'll let it ring twice to see if the manager answers it first before picking it up. She says, ""You know, if you're by the phone you can pick it up, don't just let it ring.""

Which is what I did, but since we are always customer facing I wait two rings to make sure the manager doesn't pick it up first. Her tone of voice felt very condescending to me, like she was talking to someone who was slow, lazy, and too stupid to know how to do their job or even answer a phone.

Today, though, I was cleaning the restrooms when she asked me to stop what I was doing and cover the front while she went outside to help a customer. I had no problem with that. I put a sign in front of the door to prevent customers from using the restroom while there was chemicals sprayed all over.

While she was outside someone from the main store dropped off some mail. So when she came back I said I was going to take the mail to the manager's office and finish cleaning the restrooms. She tried grabbing the letter from me. But I said it's ok I can do it since I have to go back that way anyways.

Halfway through my cleaning task I returned to the front to wait for a customer to get out of the other restroom and the supervisor lays into me. 

""Next time when there is a customer up front you take care of the customer first before you leave.""

I told her, ""But you were up here, too, and I had to finish cleaning the restrooms.""

""If it doesn't apply then let it fly but you should always take care of the customer first.""

""You were up here, too, why couldn't you help the customer while I finished what I started?""

She started muttering stuff about how she doesn't want things to get hostile but if I want to get hostile we can. So I told her I don't appreciate her talking to me like I'm stupid and I walked away to complete my task I left unfinished.

She then followed me into the bathroom to tell me, ""I don't talk to you like you're stupid I talk to you like you're human."" To which I said, ""But that's the way you come across sometimes.""

She said, ""I can't control the way people perceive me.""

I told her that I think she needs to walk away and calm down for now because her tone was very defensive and agitated. The reason I walked away was to do the same.

She continued to raise her voice at me about if I wanna have it out with her then come have it out. To which I said, ""See? This is exactly what I'm talking about.""

I spoke to the manager about it and he said he didn't think that she meant it like that. So now I'm wondering am I overreacting? Cause to me I feel like she's been very petty and nitpicking everything I do to get to this point and now I'm being made to feel like I'm crazy imagining her barely veiled hostility towards me. ""It you wanna get hostile then we can get hostile."" ""When you wanna have it out with me come have it out.""",1,1764978280.0,AmIOverreacting,3,1.0,False

\- Kalita Wave 185 Minoyaki   
\- Hario Buono stovetop   
\- Hario Drip Assist 

The drip assist was a bit of a frivolous purchase since I did buy a gooseneck, but in the end I thought it would be a fun accessory to have.

I did consider buying the Q-Air but then decided I would much rather get a better grinder for my birthday in a few months (big believer of buy-once, cry-once. Don't like the idea of getting something entry level and then upgrading a few months later.) 

  
Mostly just want to ask if people here have any tips/tricks to get the most out of pre-ground beans (I am well aware they go kinda stale fast and that I should get a grinder etc etc but I'm a student and doing my best really)

One thing I’ve been extremely diligent on, after doing a lot of research, is to ensure that my general lifestyle when taking Vyvanse is as “clean” as possible. Which means that 99% of the time I slept on time, got my 8 hours in, had a protein-heavy meal before taking my meds, and ensure I’m getting enough food, protein and water throughout the day. I have also mostly cut out coffee and have been going to the gym regularly. my diet has been super clean as well - high in healthy proteins and fats, low in processed carbs and almost zero sugar except for some treats here and there (I’m also prediabetic so this worked out for me regardless). 

I found that the more consistently I maintained those habits, the better the Vyvanse worked without any major negative side effects.

Over the last 2-3 months though I’ve pretty much completely fallen off of those habits. I went through some rough personal stuff in early fall and it really led to a period of depression, heartbreak and stress. I was still taking my meds but my habits around it completely fell by the wayside.

I have basically only been getting 3-4 hours of proper sleep per night, and my diet has been horrible - I’ve either been going days with barely eating or binge-eating tons of sugar and junk food. I’ve been drinking a ton of coffee while on Vyvanse and drinking here and there too - which I didn’t do before. I’ve stopped going to the gym as well.

and man the effects have been ROUGH. not only is the positive effects from the Vyvanse not as impactful as they used to be, the negative effects have become more pronounced. I’m having trouble sleeping due to the combination of caffeine and Vyvanse, I get headaches more often during the day, my appetite has reduced even more and one of the worst parts is that my libido and general ability to maintain an erection has gotten worse - which was never an issue before.

anybody else notice this when you fell off the wagon so to speak when it came to lifestyle changes to account for vyvanse? I’m slowly trying to get back into my routine but damn it’s crazy how much you have to “optimize” your lifestyle for the meds to work properly lol.",27,1764977512.0,VyvanseADHD,9,0.97,False

I took adderall over a decade ago, then my insurance ran out and I never bothered getting it prescribed again due to financial and motivational reasons (also a stupid apprehension I had about not wanting to ""need"" medication).

Eventually I developed coping strategies and was mostly functional lol

Anyway, recently I've been less functional so I finally got my prescription back and it just feels really different. I remember back then feeling energetic and focused and like I had it together. 30 min after taking it I felt like my mind would change. 

I tend to be really sensitive to meds I think because I'm really petite. I'm pretty sure I was only on 5mg 2x/day which I know for most people would do nothing but for me really helped.

My new prescription is for the same, 5mg 2x/day but I'm not feeling that different and still not really focused. 

I've only been on it a couple days so I don't know if that matters, I remember it making a difference immediately last time but of course it's been a while I could be misremembering.

Before anyone asks, I'm really boring and the only stimulant I've done between the two prescriptions is caffeine with my morning coffee lol despite the username which is from more than a decade ago haha

Is it possible that age made me less sensitive to it?

1pfa65j,https://www.reddit.com/r/AeroPress/comments/1pfa65j/aeropress_premium_review/,AeroPress Premium Review,"I've held off on the aeropress because of the introduction of plastic. This is apparently a far touchier subject in the community than I anticipated (although it makes sense), judging by a few of the more popular reviews on youtube. 

In any case, I just wanted to offer my two cents, given that I did get the AeroPress Premium (black friday special... a meager 10% off). For me, it is fantastic. I've owned almost every single type of coffee maker: french press, pour over, espresso machine, moka pot. This maker is pretty much the best of all of them combined, with just a few small shortcomings (like only one cup per use) that everyone here is aware of.

Given that I haven't used the regular aeropress, I can't comment on how this one exceeds or falls short in any area. You get what everyone probably recognizes as aeropress coffee, which is a good thing if you're already here. I can only add that the parts fit well together, are easy to clean, and seem like they will last me a long time.

**Iced Coffee:**

I almost always drink iced coffee, and the aeropress has been easy to use for that purpose. Here's how I do it. 

For really quick math, you can take any recommended quantity of coffee and multiply it by 3/2 (or 1.5) and any recommended quantity of water and multiply it by 3/4 (or .75). This will result in coffee potency that is twice as strong (because 1.5/.75 = 2), which you can then dilute over ice and receive equivalent strength. This recipe may be a _bit_ strong, so feel free to relax the quantity of coffee or increase the water over time, as you feel it out.

What's cool about this rule of thumb is that you can simply do 1.5 scoops of coffee and only fill the water to the #3 line on the AeroPress Premium (not sure what it is on regular aeropress, but the premium has 4 markings on the tube for water).",1,1764977463.0,AeroPress,3,0.6,False

I moved to a new city and I don’t have any friends here. People from work are rude to me, treating me like I’m an idiot. I spend most of my time at home. Meeting people these days feels difficult. People don’t even look at each other. My best years are slipping away while I sit at home lonely.

Is it even possible to make friends these days? I think it’s easier to find a job than a friend. People seem so hostile to each other and so self-centred. Seriously, whenever I’m in a public placenlike a coffee shop I feel even more lonely, because of how I see people behave. And it feels widespread.

I went to dancing classes but I left, because I felt like cattle. People would come and not speak to each other. Why should I go to a group where everyone acts like they are there only for themselves? They don’t even look at others. I say hello, they look at me like I’m dumb. I try small talk, they don’t respond like they want to talk. They never start conversations with me or anyone, unless they came with a friend then suddenly they’re loud and open.

And it also makes me depressed that almost all hobby activities are paid. There is no place where you can go for free and meet people.

I lived in a shared apartment with a roommate, and she would almost never talk to me. She was polite, but never asked questions. We would say hello, talk for maybe a minute, but she wasn’t interested. I thought she was shy or introverted, but then she invited her friend and acted like a totally different person extroverted, laughing, always having something to talk about. But with me, there was awkward silence and short replies, no interest, no curiosity. It really hurts me how selective people can be.

I spent weeks alone, and she never thought about including me or introducing me to her friend. And I overheard her gossiping about me, even though she barely knew anything.

If I had friends, I would include people who seem lonely. I don’t know some people are just so unbothered by others.

For years I’ve been thinking a lot about what I can do to stop being lonely. I spent all my New Year’s Eves at home because I don't have friends. This year I will probably spend it at home again, because I don’t know where to go, and going out alone at night scares me.

After I finish work, I want to go outside, but I don’t know where to go. I usually just go for a walk to be around people, or I go to a shop and this is my form of socializing.

I think about going to a concert or a party, but I’m sad almost all the time. If I went, I wouldn’t feel like I’m going to have fun, but more like I’m going because I’m scared of being alone  while everyone else would be with their friends. I also worry that going to events at night by myself is scary, because I would have no one to call.

I’ve thought about dating apps, but it scares me to post my photos and risk failure. My experience with neurotypical people has been negative  I never felt liked by them.

HUGE crush on a girl working there.,"I go to the same coffee shop pretty much every day because they have a subscription where you pay $50 per month to get one free coffee per day (so I'm saving hundreds of dollars by patronizing them). I figured that if I was going to be spending a lot of time at the coffee shop I might as well get to know the baristas a little bit, so I started by asking their names and gradually over time I feel like I've developed pretty solid friendships with them. There is one barista in particular I have a crush on, and I'm trying to figure out whether or not she actually seems interested.

She has always had noticeably warmer energy toward me than other customers. I don't see her as often as I see the other baristas because she's working on a master's degree at a nearby university (which is actually one of the top 10 universities in the country... I love smart girls), but she is very friendly. I started by mostly talking to her about her degree. She's studying environmental science, and we've bonded over environmental issues. I'm vegetarian/vegan and have always been really passionate about environmental justice and animal rights, so our values feel like they line up really nicely.

Even on days when I'm quiet or tired, she will initiate conversation. If I just order a caramel mocha, she will comment on it. There have been some moments that felt a bit more personal. Once I was showing another customer a video of my dog running in the snow and she specifically asked to see it, and her reaction felt genuinely warm. Another time she brought in a dog she was pet-sitting while she was off shift, and he ran up to me and wouldn't leave me alone; she thought it was so cute. These are tiny moments, but they didn't feel like generic customer service.

There is also a homeless guy who has been coming in to the shop (although he hasn't been in recently, so I think they ended up banning him). They used to give him free food because they knew they always had to throw some away at the end of the day and figured they might as well kill two birds with one stone. Eventually he started abusing that so I stepped in and offered to pay for him to get something to eat. But one day he picked a fight with other customers in the shop while my crush was working, so I stepped in and helped de-escalate the situation. I wasn't trying to impress her (I didn't even see her in that way at the time), but she definitely noticed, and I feel like this contributes to the general picture of me as someone who is kind, principled, and safe.

Recently, I was talking to one of the other baristas, and I made a self-deprecating remark about being ugly. She commented that even though she is a lesbian she ""has eyes"" and could easily tell that I was not at all ugly. She also commented that this was a conversation she had with at least one other person. There are only a few women who work in the shop, and she's a lesbian, one of the other girls is in a relationship, so by process of elimination it doesn't seem unlikely that one of these people could have been the girl I'm crushing on now.

The thing holding me back is that I go to this coffee shop every day, as long as I'm in town. It's part of my routine. I love the vibe, and the staff are cool. I don't want to make it awkward or lose my hangout spot if it goes south.",1,1764977198.0,TalesFromYourBarista,2,1.0,False

So….I cried. I’m still crying. ",3,1764976016.0,pregnant,2,0.81,False

They serve eightthirty coffee which I love and it’s good. They had a good range of cabinet food that is apparently made there and brunch menu too. 

Recommend it although I didn’t try any of the food. They open at 6am during week which I like because can grab a coffee on way home from the gym",7,1764975989.0,aucklandeats,3,1.0,False

1pf9jqq,https://i.redd.it/focksxdxug5g1.jpeg,Is iced decaf actually decaf??,I was watching the employee make my drink this morning (a medium iced decaf) and noticed they only have a single iced coffee tap labeled 'original blend' along with taps for cold brew and nitro. I saw the employee use the same tap for someone else's regular iced coffee and then my decaf. Makes me wonder if I've been drinking regular iced coffee this whole time as it definitely feels like I'm getting something after drinking it. This morning there was a woman working who I'd never seen before and I'm 100% certain she poured me a regular iced coffee this time as I was so wired and jittery all day.,4,1764975840.0,DunkinDonuts,10,0.67,False
1pf9jio,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1pf9jio/seemed_to_have_developed_gerd_literally_out_of/,Seemed to have developed GERD literally out of nowhere one day and for no clear reason,"Some important context: I'm 19, don't smoke, don't drink frequently (and before this all happened, I'd only been drinking for about a year), and I'm a healthy weight (if slightly underweight), and I stopped drinking coffee completely, right as my symptoms began.

Around August, I was boarding a plane when I suddenly felt an overwhelming nausea. It was so bad that I had to get off and miss my flight. For the next 8 hours, I was sat in the airport as it very slowly tapered off and I was okay enough to make it home. I think the nausea may have triggered a panic attack at the same time since I was alone and I'm really scared of vomiting (though, through this whole saga, I haven't vomited once). However, I'm almost certain that the nausea came first before the panic attack – I don't have a fear of flying and I've been perfectly fine every time I've flown alone before. 

  
A few days later, I was still feeling ok so I got another flight and had a panic attack in the airport because for some reason my brain was telling me that what had happened last time would happen again – as much as I tried, I couldn't even force myself to go through security. Eventually, I gave up and went home again.

The next evening, out of nowhere the sudden and intense nausea returned and the worst of it continued for 18 hours. This time, it didn't get completely better and even after the worst had passes, I couldn't even eat 1/4 of a slice of toast. Over the next week and a half, the nausea gradually subsided at a painfully slow rate. By that point, I'd been to a doctor twice: first they said it was probably an infection (I had no other symptoms) the second time they said it was acid reflux and gave me some cyclizine (anti-nausea med). Two hours after taking cyclizine, I lay down in bed and felt a rush of warm liquid (not acidic, more like warm water) flow up to my throat. I rushed to the bathroom expecting to throw up but didn't. Instead, I spent the next few hours trying to keep the contents of my stomach from flowing back up my throat until it eventually subsided. I took another cyclizine the next day and the exact same thing happened again – it seemed to just be an unlucky side-effect of the meds. I never took cyclizine again and I was completely recovered.... for at least a week. 

In the meantime, my blood tests and H-pylori results came back negative (except for a vitamin D deficiency).

After a week of being relieved that my troubles were over, it came back. Not with sudden, intense nausea this time, but just constant 24/7 indigestion. It felt like my stomach was restless and eating anything was a battle to keep it down. I thought maybe I had just had something too spicy or fatty too soon and I could just ride it out and be more careful in my recovery the next time, but I couldn't. I went back to university at the end of the summer break, but came back after 3 days after I had an almost constant 36-hour panic attack about eating, which had only been making it worse. I went to the doctor a third time and was prescribed omeprazole. I took it for 4 weeks and during that time I was mercifully symptom-free and my life returned to normal. 

I stopped cold-turkey after my 4 weeks was up and after about a week of a mild (but expected) rebound, I was fine again.... for about a week. Then it all came back, mildly at first, but after 3 weeks it started to accelerate, which brings us to today. 

I just can't fathom why this is happening to me – I've had panic attacks, yes, but not enough for them to be the actual cause. There isn't anything in my lifestyle that I can really change to make this better, and as far as I know, chronic GERD doesn't just switch on at 5:50am on a random Monday.

I just put it up for sale. Today I got an email from Ebay stating I need explain myself.  . Ask me to make my case about intellectual property with product. I sold it and shipped it yesterday. Its a cheap bag of nasty stuff claiming to be coffee. I undercut all the sellers on ebay because I didnt want a foodstuff on Ebay in case it didnt srll and I forgot. The expire date was like 12/26. What gives? Since I sold it and ship it should I ignore the important eBay email. This is my worst Xmas ever so far on ebay. Down 56 percent from last year. ,3,1764975697.0,eBaySellers,5,1.0,False
1pf9gm0,https://www.reddit.com/r/neurofibromatosis/comments/1pf9gm0/intro/,Intro,"Hello, I’m 24 and I am from Singapore. I had NF1 since young. It start showing up on my body when I was about 6. It’s little and small but a little obvious. Kids in school said I had virus. My callsign was “Alice virus”. And tha upset me a lot. I have super duper low self esteem and I really hated myself and blame myself. The question that I ask often is “why me” 
Home was not that welcoming as my parents are strict. About 9 my parents sent me to a home guardian. She is not nice. She was horrible. Contact night mare. It makes my time after school even worse. 
I was force to drop dancing, which I love a lot. Forced to eat chilli padi as punishment. It was a horrible time in primary school (preschool). 
My metal health got so bad when I went to secondary school (middle school) I went to see the school counsellor a few times. My secondary school times was numb as I was too just focusing on my study but I only know that I told my teacher “life sucks”. For 4 years I alway say life sucks. The teacher that has always been with me told me to stop saying such things. But I just can’t cos no one was there with me. I needed love. You guys must be wondering no relative ? Yes In fact. My dad side siblings they are not close and there will be outcasts btw their self, my mum side siblings are all oversea. 
I went on to poly being super duper dependent emotionally. I often follow on to my classmates around as if I don’t have my own life. They told me to stop being clingy and that sentence trash me and my world crash. I lost all hope and it worsen my self esteem.  Yet I am independent financially as I work in a coffee shop (bubble tea shop) I mad friends and talk out , they made me laugh. 
I went to look for a decent job that pays quite well. But 3-4 years into it people isn’t jive to me anymore bcos I am awkward as i feel very low and down when think too lowly of myself when I like some one. I lost myself again. 

I am just writing about how having NF1 cause me to have slight depression that I refuse to admit and accept. 
Now I am slowly learning to accept NF1 and working on my mental health. I hope day and life will be better soon.
